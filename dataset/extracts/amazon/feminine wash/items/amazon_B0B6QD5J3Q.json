                "reviewText": "The last time I raved about a feminine wash kit, I felt silly a few days later because it didn't work as effectively. After trying out this Summer's Eve wash and serum, what I will say is that I am extremely pleased. I felt fresh all day, despite bladder issues from tons of coughing and sneezing. The wash smells amazing. It's gentle and almost pleasant enough to use as an all over body wash:) There seems to be a generous amount of product in this feminine wash. It's creamy, and not a gel consistency, and I'm mentioning that because I felt like it lasted and I was able to get a decent wash before I rinsed it away. The serum is to be applied after the shower. I rubbed it on with clean hands. The reason for the five star review is the FRESHNESS! I was good to go all day. That really boosted my confidence. NO IRRITATION WHATSOEVER! It didn't cause dryness or itchiness and that, ladies and gentlemen, is a vote of confidence from me! I included the pictures of the packaging to shoutout the company for making sure it was safe during the shipment process. Summer's Eve rocks for this!",

                "reviewText": "I really like this Summer\u2019s Eve combination. The older I get, the more dry my skin becomes. Some areas need a little help\u2014the skin serum is ideal for more intimate places. I\u2019ve tried other brands, and they soothe, but also feel too greasy. This formula is perfect\u2014a combination of vitamin E, aloe and coconut oil hydrate and soften skin without the added greasiness. I appreciate that it\u2019s free of fragrance too. Just a little dab provides a day\u2019s worth of comfort. This product is ideal for middle-aged women like me.The luxurious wash is equally as nice. It\u2019s lightly scented with a fragrance that isn\u2019t overpowering\u2014simply a fresh, pleasant smell. I feel confidently clean after using the wash\u2014it\u2019s pH balanced and made without parabens, dyes or silicones.I\u2019m glad Summer\u2019s Eve makes so many quality products for intimate areas, and at an affordable price--getting this pair as a set is an even better value.",

                "reviewText": "The scent is nice and I really do like the serum, it is very soothing, especially post- shaving.However this is very expensive to buy as a set... the whole point of a set is to maybe get a little bit of a price break, but this is actually more expensive to buy as a set than to buy each product individually. If you add up the current cost of each individual item on Amazon and in retail stores on average it is around $4 more to buy the set! Why???The wash is also more than all the other Summer's Eve washes... almost double the per oz price! I'm not sure there's anything really all that more special about this wash than the others... for some reason they're really proud of this one.So while the products are \"nice\", the price on this is just not cost effective enough for me to recommend this set. Unless they bring the cost down under probably $16. If you really want to try these, I suggest buying separately.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using Summer's Eve products for years. The biggest difference with this product from the ones you buy at your local store is definitely the creaminess. Its a thicker, more luxurious feeling cleanser than the regular non-cream ones. It smells absolutely amazing. I am a woman who uses more \"men's\" smelling products so I really like this. Not sweet or fruity smelling. The after shave cream has seemed to help fight against razor bumps in the bikini area. I have used it a few times after shaving and it feels very nice. No burn to the product. I think this is a great set and would definitely buy again.",
