                "reviewText": "I have been a women\u2019s health nurse for 16 years. I was a bit nervous to try boric acid. Our providers/doctors always use it as a last option to treat recurrent infections or infections that are difficult to treat. It always seemed like it was pulling out the big guns. However, I was feeling a little out of balance. I had been tested for all possible infections and everything was fine. I added oral probiotic without much improvement. So I did a little research to make sure I was good and informed. I tried this product for two nights in a row. After the first night, my symptoms were 75% resolved. Completely resolved after the second. I did not have any negative side effects. I plan to use one after intercourse just to help maintain ph.Things to know:Boric acid\u2019s biggest side effect is vaginal irritation. It can cause pain, burning, and/or bleeding if the irritation gets bad enough. If this happens, stop using the boric acid ASAP and see you gynecologist. Make sure that they know that you used boric acid so that you can get the best care possible.This product comes in little vaginal caplets. They have a little gel cover that melts within the vagina and releases the medication. The caplets could easily be confused with an oral medication. Please note that this medication is POISON IF SWALLOWED. It should only be used vaginally to avoid harm.",
