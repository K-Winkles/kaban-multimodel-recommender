                "reviewText": "TMI warning.I struggle with a lot of discharge. I'm not sure why, it's just the way my body is I guess. This discharge does not smell great. I had to change my undies at least twice a day. I would get self-conscious at gatherings because I could smell it, and was worried others could too. After trying tea tree oil and a deodorant that didn't work for me, I was about ready to give up.I found this oil on Amazon that claimed to get rid of the smell, but it was ridiculously expensive. I then found this one, and figured I'd give it a chance since it was more reasonably priced. When I opened it, I really liked the smell. It is an overwhelming rose scent but not to the point where you could smell it over clothing. I slapped some onto the bad boy, and went about my day. Over time, I noticed that the smell of the oil really helps. Even with the discharge, it kind of mixes with the oil and it doesn't smell nearly as bad as it used to. It's pleasant. I use it on my bits and then wipe the rest on the undies. It's become something I do once a day in the morning and I'm pretty satisfied. The bottle itself has a lot of grammar mistakes and is probably made in China, but I don't care. I would still recommend. It's not perfect, but it's pretty close.",
