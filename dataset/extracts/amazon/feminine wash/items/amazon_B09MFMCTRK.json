The added vitamin C seemed to enhance its effectiveness, leaving my skin feeling refreshed after each use. This is to be noted that it only happens over time, though.However, one drawback I found was their quick depletion. These bars seemed to run out faster than I anticipated, especially considering their price. While the results were impressive, the shorter lifespan of the product made it less economical compared to similar options I've used previously.Despite this, if you're looking for a quick and effective solution to tackle dark spots and uneven skin tone, these soap bars could be a solid choice. Just keep in mind that their shorter lifespan might affect the overall value for prolonged use.",

My face is bright and dark spots from sun damage are almost gone! I no longer wear foundation or even a powder! My skin has never looked better and I am 59! My chest had some sun damage and it is disappearing before my eyes. I have been using it for months and every time I shower/wash my face it seems even better than before. I am a loyal customer for LIFE! I'm even starting a subscription, which I have never done before for anything. I wish I had taken before pics but had no idea that a little bar of soap could make such a difference. 100% recommend, but only to people I really love. LoL",
