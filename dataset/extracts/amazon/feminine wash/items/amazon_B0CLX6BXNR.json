HOWEVER we have all experienced those moments of panic when you have caught a whiff of yourself and all you can think about is how everyone else is suddenly a blood hound and can smell you too. For peace of mind get yourself a bottle of this. The jug I got is huge and you only need a small squirt to properly cleanse that area. It\u2019s going to last a long while and you\u2019ll thank yourself for this quick new step to your daily hygiene. It works great on my sensitive skin. To be honest I thought this was going to cause big problems down there because of how sensitive my body is but in fact I haven\u2019t had any bad reactions. I\u2019m feeling more confident than ever.",

                "reviewText": "This Summer's Eve ultimate odor control feminine wash works great. It has a light scent to it that's tart and floral. It has a thick consistency and a light lather. It leaves me feeling really clean and it keeps me fresh all day long. The bottle doesn't have any type of safety seal on it but most feminine washes don't for some reason. Great working feminine wash for odor control.",
