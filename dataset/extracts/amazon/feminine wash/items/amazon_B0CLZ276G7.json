I made that mistake many years ago and it did not serve me well.Monistat Boric Acid Feminine Cleanser checked all of my boxes. This cleanser is clear, unscented, gentle enough for daily use, and it\u2019s formulated to support a healthy pH balance. Not only do I use it for daily cleansing but it also works well during menses or after intimacy.This product isn\u2019t thick like a gel but more like the consistency of a body wash so it\u2019s easy to dispense. Once applied, it rinses leaving no residue and it cleanses thoroughly. I haven\u2019t experienced any irritation or adverse reactions.This product has worked well for me. It had been effective at maintaining a clean and healthy pH environment and I feel confidently fresh! I am very pleased with this product. I also like that it\u2019s packaged in a generous sized bottle making it a great value for the money.",

I trust a name brand product. I used the cleanser as directed and I am happy with the product. It may sound gross, but I purposely waited to shower 2 -3 days after I used the product. There isn't any odor and I still feel clean - a big contract than using the other washes on private parts. I looked up boric acid as I know my parents used it years ago. Boric acid is a form of a natural mineral boron that is found in seawater. Boric acid promotes vaginal balance, by maintaining your vaginal PH. I think this is better than using fragrance smelling washes on privates.",

First of all, it\u2019s a nice, thick liquid soap, so a little goes a long way. However, it has a lot of extra ingredients like Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. I also didn\u2019t like the fact that it wasn\u2019t sealed inside the lid.Otherwise it\u2019s a very good value for the size and will last me for quite a long time.",

This Monistat wash is pH balanced is not runny like many cleansers, but more gel like and thicker. A little amount will clean the whole area, you do not need to use a lot.I read before ordering this that it is gynecologist tested, but I expect that from a well known company known for feminine care products.Very happy with the cleansing and no irritation whatsoever.Will last a very long time.

                "reviewText": "I love all the ingr\u00e9dients but this was a bit drying for me even in the shower. I never used a feminine wash because I don\u2019t like fragrances so I don\u2019t have anything to compare it to. I would use my face wash which has AHAs or Dr. Bronners, undiluted. This was more drying than Dr. Bronners surprisingly. I\u2019ll still use it but only if I\u2019m waxed because if you have any hair longer than a few cm the wash makes them feel weird and uncomfortable from the dryness",

                "reviewText": "The bottle is bigger than I expected, which is great because it will last a long time, even with daily use. I was surprised there wasn't a tamper resistant seal on the top of the bottle, which would have been nice for a little extra security, especially when using on a sensitive part of my body, but not a deal breaker for me. The gel is a nice consistency so it doesn't run right off your hand. It cleanses well and is very gentle, and, as stated in the listing, it has absolutely no scent. Keeps me feeling fresh longer than other feminine washes I've used so I would definitely recommend giving it a try.",

I have been using this in the shower every night now for a week and I just feel a lot fresher all day. The size of the bottle is also pretty big. I was surprised how big it was when it arrived so it is a good value for the price. I would purchase this again.",
