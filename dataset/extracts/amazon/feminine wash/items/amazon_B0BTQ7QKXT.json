With that being said, it has made me self conscious about the smell for a little while and I'm always looking for nice products that don't irritate my skin. I apply using my fingers and leave this on for a few minutes before rinsing off and have noticed a huge difference! I feel like the effects last at least 24 hours, if not a full 2 days. I feel much cleaner down there and have noticed major improvements! I have only purchased one bottle (4 months ago) and I'm only about 3/4 of the way thru it so it also lasts a long time if you use the right amount!",
