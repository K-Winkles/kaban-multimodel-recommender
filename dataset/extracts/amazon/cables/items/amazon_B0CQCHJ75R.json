                "reviewText": "This is a flat, anti-tangle, fast charging, 100,000 bend lifespan, 100 W, 6 foot cable that is capable of doing 480 Mbps data transfer. It has 2 different distinct ends. One end has a Lightning connector while the other end has a USB-Type A connector. However, if you push the botton on the bottom of each connector case, and slide the end up, each reveals a USB Type-C connection (underneath the covers). So one end is USB-Type A OR USB Type-C while the other end has Lightning OR USB Type-C. So basically you can charge any device (laptop, tablet, smart watch, power bank, or smartphone) that has a Lightning or USB Type-C port. There is no charging of devices that have outdated micro-USB ports. Here are the cable ends in graphical format.USB-Type A (outside) OR USB-Type C (inside) --------------------------------------------------------- USB-Type C (inside) OR Lightning (outside)The USB-Type C connector makes a nice tight connection with my Android device and it charges it up faster than other cables. I recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "Great cable overall.I had a similar one from the Rolling Square brand which also had micro usb which this doesn't. I don't mind as I'm switching all my devices away from micro usb.I like that it can do both USB C and Lightning so that means I only have to carry 1 cable for charging my Macbook and iPhone. This also now supports 100W where they had an older version that only went upto 60W. 60W was also good enough for most devices but always better to have it higher just in case. It still only transfers 480mbps though.I like how it also came with some additional goodies such as extra cable ties and cable organizer that sticks on your desk.Overall a very good cable and good to have and travel with.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this specifically because it was a bundle of the cable and flashlight and only got the cable, what the heck.Company wrote me in response to my review asserting it was my misunderstanding about the bundle. No, it's how you had it posted. It said bundle in the description. The picture selection I clicked on before hitting 'ad to cart' had both items in the picture. You needed to change how it was listed, not blame people for thinking they're getting the bundle when they click on the picture you put there that shows both items right on it. It wasn't my confusion, it's how it was listed. I see it's been changed since to make it much more clear, but I feel the company could have handled their reply to me better and acknowledged their part in how the item was posted.Aside from that, the cable is good and thick, but the end portion around the cable connection is rather large. For my iPad in the case, I cannot use the lightning cable connection because the housing around the connector is so large. Otherwise, haven't had any other problems so far.",
