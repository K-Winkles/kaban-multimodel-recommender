I ordered a couple of their regular thickness 18Gbps \"certified\" cables but it does not bend well and I actually had problems with mine. I could have exchanged it with Monoprice but since it was so thick and non-flexible I spent like 6 bucks for this one instead and am very happy! For this model Monoprice didn't pay the HDMI consortium racket for their \"certification\" but works perfect as at least HDMI 2.0b, can't say if it hits 48Gbps, but for most people it does.",
