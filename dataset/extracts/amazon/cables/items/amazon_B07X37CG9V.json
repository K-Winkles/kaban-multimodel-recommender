I have been using this for well over a year now a never a trace of noise in the signal. A 15' cable would reach from the TV to where I use the laptop but run across the middle of the room. I tried 30 and 35' cables but they were not quite long enough for where I wanted to route the cable. This 40' cable reaches from the back of the TV, laying snug against the wall out of the way of foot traffic and the vacuum, reaching around the tv stand, past other furniture, behind the couch and coming out from under an end table to exactly where I use the laptop. When I'm not connecting the laptop, I keep the end of the cable coiled neatly and tucked just under the end table (with a dust cover over the end), so I can easily grab the end and connect it. I have other cables in other lengths, from this seller, and they all perform well.",
