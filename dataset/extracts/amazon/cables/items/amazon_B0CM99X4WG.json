                "reviewText": "These cables come with the means to run the wire along trim or down the wall for you to be able to secure the cable so there isn't an area of slack to get caught on anything. The one thing I noticed is that when I was trying to put my Wyze pan into the harness this cable, no matter how far into the micro-USB slot on the camera it can go, does the 90 degree micro-usb sit flush against the rotating disc on my Wyze camera. This makes it very difficult to hand the camera. Now that being said, it might work with the harness that comes with the Wyze pan camera out of the box but for me I needed a particular harness to fix the camera where I need it in my home and the harness I am using sits flat onto the bottom of the camera. Other than that, the length of the cable is great and for most micro-usb cameras this will be a great option.",

The hold is of a decent diameter and more than enough to allow a regular Coaxial Cable to pass. So I thought there shouldn't be any problem for this thin and flat cord. But why the micro USB end was made as 90\u00b0? The USB plug protrudes and can't pass the hole now. I tried to expand the hole a little bit but the protruding USB plug got stucked in the wall structure. No luck after hours attempt.",
