            "\u3010GOOD QUALITY & STRONG ADHESIVE\u3011Transparent cable clips made of eco-friendly plastic ABS material, peel and stick with 3M strong self-adhesive. Easily mount to the clean smooth, oil-free, dust-free and water free surfaces.",
            "\u3010WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS\u3011Transparent cable clips can be applied to network cables, mouse cables, keyboard cables, Christmas lights cable, string lights cables, USB cables, cell phone chargers, power cords, charging cable.",
            "\u3010AVAILABLE OCCASION\u3011No need to punch a hole or attach any screws. Attach to a smooth, clean surface such as metal, glass, plastic, wood, stone, tile, desk, wall, table and other flat surface. Do not paste it on the material of plush and lime wall.",
            "[HOW TO STALL]Please wipe and paste. After pasting, press for 3 seconds or press four corners for better effect. In particular, the uneven surface must be pressed for more than 5 seconds due to the small contact surface between the adhesive and the back glue. Do not shake the clip to test the adhesion when it is just glued on, because it usually takes more than 48 hours for the double-sided adhesive to play its maximum adhesion and stabilize."
