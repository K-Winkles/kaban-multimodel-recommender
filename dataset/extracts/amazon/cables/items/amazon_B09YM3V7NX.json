Testing reveals that it does contain an \"e marker\" chip to signal an attached device that higher power charging is possible.I've tested it with a 100 watt USB C charger and laptop computer. It worked perfectly well with both. I only wish it was offered in longer versions. (At the time I placed my order, it was not.) I don't have any USB C devices that use higher power to test the 240 watt claim. However, I have no reason to doubt it.",
