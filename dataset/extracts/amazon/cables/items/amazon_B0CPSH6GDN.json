                "reviewText": "First Impressions of Bynccea USB C to USB C Charger Cable 4-Pack 6ft Fast Charging USB C Cable, Nylon Braided 60W(3A) Type C to Type C Cable for Phone 15/15 Pro/15 Plus/15 Pro Max S22 S23 Note 20This colorful array of long cables are inexpensive and have high utility. The colors are bright and shiny - easy to color code your connections. Make no doubt, there\u2019s no confusing these cables with ultra-luxe high end big dollar cables but, as budget charging cables, I think these are pretty good. From a value factored rating, I give this set of cables 5-stars. They work well and are so inexpensive; this set is one of the best bargains I\u2019ve seen \u2013 4 cables for the price of 2 or 3. Read on for additional details.Generally, I am a believer that \u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d. Also, generally, I am willing to buy very expensive phone charging cables that are durable, reliable, and trustworthy. I really despise spending hair pulling time and energy, to diagnose smartphone charging problems. If I can trust and eliminate the cable as a factor, troubleshooting can go much faster.As a technologist, a tech beta tester, and mobile game enthusiast, I have equipment beyond what the average person owns and uses. Personally, I play on a minimum of 8+ smartphones and have dozens of laptops in my house, besides all the other junk. I am constantly in need of cables and chargers, all over my house and in my car - and prefer this charging equipment to be high performance and reliable.Normally, I would not fool around with cables in this price point, but as a Vine Voice, I have the opportunity to give you my opinion.I ordered these cables strictly for charging devices. What attracted me was the 60 watt claim. The pair of cables come shipped in a plastic bag. The cables were fairly limber but yet slightly stiff and had no major kinks. The cable measured right at 6 feet. The braided material is a reinforced nylon - resembling kevlar.I tested the power capability with my most powerful charger and my hungriest device. The charger is capable of putting out 140 watts of power, while the device is capable of charging around 90 watts - both beyond what the cable is rated for. I used a watt meter to measure the electricity used from the wall outlet. I approximated the efficiency of the charger by comparing the energy output at the port with a watt meter cable and divided by the energy coming from the wall \u2013 and determined that the charger\u2019s efficiency is around 90%.When I plugged this cable into the device to begin the charging test, the wall meter conveniently measured 61 watts - which, to me, is close enough. Sometimes, the longer cables lose efficiency as the longer length creates more resistance.Other comments I have are the plug decisively mates with the port with a very satisfying click. This cable isn\u2019t likely to come loose either - the hold or grip on the port was above average and impressive to me. I did not do a data measurement because I do not plan to ever use these for data transfers - this is a matter of trust. Cheaper cables are prone to data corruption or data loss due to lower quality construction. However, with that being said, I did plug my phone to the laptop and the laptop recognized that my phone was connected.I hope this helps.",

These are standard size USB-C cables ready to plug into your charger port of a computer or charger block. No instructions are required nor provided.Value is very high. These are thick, durable, flexible cables that are extra long and super reinforced.First of all you are getting 4 cables for a very low price. What could be better.Second, at 10 feet of length they are nearly double the standard cable length - to reach those distant spots.Third, the ends are reinforced with a rubber sleeve to prevent bending damage. Most cables don\u2019t do this.Fourth, they are very much high power cables at 60 watts each. This buys you time in the future for those devices that will need this extra capacity. Most cables are only one-third this capable.And most important, they fit well, work well, and are very easy to work with.Value is exceptionally high at $14 for a 4-pack.

Families, multi-device owners, and victims of charger thiefs will all find greatness in this multi pack of cables. The four vibrant colors are easy to differentiate and nice to look at. This way, each person or device can have their own designated cord. They are not plain black or white, so hopefully this could also deter someone from \"accidentally\" mixing it up with yours!The charger is capable of fast charge, and works well. The double braided nylon adds some much needed protection for daily use, and keeps the cable from easily fraying or snapping. Rubber at the ends keeps the most fragile and often broken part of the cable sturdy and secure. I appreciate how the ends of the cables are all labeled \"60W,\" so if you forget and accidentally mix up your chargers, you'll know which is which.I like the convenience of a long reaching charger, and the stiffness of the cord prevents it from being easily tangled up. Great pack and well worth the price!",

                "reviewText": "This review is for Bynccea USB C to USB C Charger Cable 4-Pack 6ft.This seems like an very good cable overall.Tried it out from a USB wall charger to my Motorola Android phone and also between that phone and my Dell laptop.Compared to some other cables I have, this had a good charging rate pretty much in the middle of the pack. (The only one better was rated for 240W). Phone app showed 1000 mA at 5V.Data transfer rate was about 30 MB/sec which I measured by sending a very large file between the two devices. This was no different from some other cables.The USB plug ends fit very solidly into both devices.I like the colors - colored connectors are easier to distinguish in a bag or box and also easier to be sure its my own.",

Now everyone has their own color and no one can claim so and so stole/ \"borrowed \" their charger.The length is good in the car to reach any different port in the front or back. Connect well to all our Samsung phones and tablets.",
