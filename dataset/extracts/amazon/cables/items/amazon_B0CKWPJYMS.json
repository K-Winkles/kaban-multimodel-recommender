                "reviewText": "This zip tie mount kit is so useful. I have certain situations that I wish I could tie an object to something permanently using my hands. Of course, my hands can't do that permanently. I have used tapes in the past. The results are either the tape loses its adhesion or the result looks undesirable or an eye sore.This zip tie mount kit allows me to put a zip tie where I couldn't use a zip tie before. I have one example: I have a lamp. The switch is always not properly aligned. It drives my partner crazy. This zip tie grabs the lamp cable and the switch tightly. The switch is now properly aligned and the whole thing looks neat.The mount kit has a placeholder that holds the zip tie against the cable.The adhesion of the mount kit is very good. I wouldn't expect it to hold against heavy object pulled down by gravity. However, holding a cable, this mount kit has a sufficient adhesion.One minor downside is the plastic enclosure is too small to hold 100 mount kits and the zip ties. The locking mechanism is only on one side. Two other sides have no locking mechanism. So a zip tie could potentially fall off.",

                "reviewText": "* Overall Impression:-Note: There is more than one variation in the listing. I'm reviewing the 100 piece (which has 200 pieces total) dark toned set.-It's an excellent value for a set of 100 of each piece (the amount will vary by which set you select) zip ties and 100 matching wall hanging self-stick mounts. They come in a nice hard shell plastic storage case and are 3M adhesive backed with a rated weight limit of up to 50 pounds.* Pros-what I liked and what worked well:-Excellent value for the quality, style and quantity.-Come in a hard-shell plastic case for storage that's sturdy and opens and closes easily.-Sturdy zip ties and sturdy wall mounts, both appear to be very well made.-100 zip ties included (in the 100 option, there are several options in the listing).-100 wall mount clips included-3M backed adhesive peel and stick style wall mount clips.-The wall clips have openings that can be used to secure them without the peel and stick adhesive using your own hardware that fits the openings. No hardware for the openings is included, you'll need your own.-Available in a lighter or darker finish color.-Zip tie length and width: 6 inches long, width 0.14 inches wide.-Wall mount clips measure 0.75 inch by 0.75 inches in a square shape.-UL certified, SGS certified, RoHS standard.-Nylon, PA66 nylon.-Rated for indoor or outdoor use.-Each zip tie and wall mount is rated for up to but not above 50 pounds in weight that it can hold.* Cons-what I didn\u2019t like and what didn\u2019t work well:-No issues.* Tips & Thoughts:-Be careful when using the stick up clips on painted or delicate surfaces. If and when you decided to remove the clips it could lift paint or damage the surface.-Be sure they are the right size, length and weight to hold your cables or items.-Be sure your surface is clean and dry before attaching the peel and stick mounts.-They suggest pressing and holding the mount during application and pressing with firm pressure it to the surface for 10 seconds for better adhesion. You install the clips then attach the zip ties.-I\u2019m not sure if you can reopen the zip ties or adjust them when they are closed. I don\u2019t think they are that style. I believe you\u2019ll have to trim them open (which will make it unusable for reuse) if you want to remove them.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good kit of zip ties and adhesive cable mounts. Although the 3M adhesive provides a good way to mount the cable block, the kit also provides an alternative by screwing or nailing the block for mounting though predrilled holes. (Note: they kit does not provide any screws or nails.) It's imperative when you use the 3m method that the surface be clean and free of debris for the adhesion to actually hold the mount and last for a reasonable period of time (preparation of the surface is key.)Also, recognize the size of the mounting block as it does not provide the ability to handle/hold a large amount of cables to be passed through the opening.This kit is primarily designed for the at home desktop setup and not the large scale business environment using larger diameter and multiple cables.The zip ties and mounts are stored (in a clear plastic case) haphazardly mixed - ties and mounts - no separate compartments for each. I sorted the cables and mounts from each other and used a different case with dividers to keep each part separate and better organized.Overall, this is a good kit for the at home cable management system. Additionally, you can use the pieces for other projects besides cable management for computers. You do get a large amount of zip ties and mounts and for the price this is a good deal.",

This 100 piece kit of sticky back mount wire management blocks is very handy for maintenance and mockup work.The 3M adhesive works well so long as the surface is clean prior to attachment.These are small size so their holding power is limited.Great price point, would recommend for any one needing mounting tabs.",
