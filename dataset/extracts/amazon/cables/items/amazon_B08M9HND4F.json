                "reviewText": "I recently decided to upgrade my 12 year old TV and blu ray player, and figured my 12 year old HDMI cable needed to be replaced too. It's a good length (better than my old 3 ft cable), it's extremely flexible yet sturdy, especially at the flex points, and the specs should meet my needs for years to come. And if it matters, the price was quite affordable.",
