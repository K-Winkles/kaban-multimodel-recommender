There are no ear hooks so it work with straight down connectors or can be worn over the ear. The chin-slider has to be my favorite for any cable I own, and all the connectors are a nice appropriately weighty metal, without being too heavy to overly weigh the cable down or anything like that. I highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I got the USB-C QDC cable and to start it's a nicely constructed cable. It's thick and seemingly durable, however there's quite a bit of memory from the packaging. There's also no formed ear hooks so you have to wrap it around everytime you want to use your headphones and sometimes they just come undone from behind the ear. Lastly the dac is low quality for the price, you can find the same chip in $9 usb-c dongles. Overall it's convenient to not have the dongle and if you have a cheap KZ IEM then this will definitely be an upgrade to whatever cable came with your IEMs",

My only note is that the chin adjuster is a little difficult to move around, but it wasn\u2019t a dealbreaker for me. Delivers quality sound if listening to hifi/hi-res audio.",

The cable just gets a bit more stiff around the ears, which is a great compromise between the hard plastic and totally limp options. I've only had it a couple weeks so I also can't comment on durability. It works well, sounds good. I used it with upper end Shures.Edit: Still working well after 9 months or so of regular use.",
