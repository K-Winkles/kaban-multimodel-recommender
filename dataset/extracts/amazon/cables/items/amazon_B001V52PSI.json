My wired sub would pop, and make the loud hum with those other cables. I did the research (finally) and decided on this Monoprice coaxial cable. This cable has been nothing short of amazing! It stopped all of the popping, and humming. It delivers nothing but clean sound from my sub. If it ever fails, I WILL buy another! Awesome product! Very happy with my purchase!",

Just moved into a new home and left the first cord at the old place just because it was too much work to save 10 bucks. I didn't hesitate to order the exact same one as the first, as it served me quite well.I have this ran up through the attic in a 22 foot long room and it's perfect to have about 5 feet or more on either end to work with. My subwoofer is a Klipsch RW-12D, and this cable works perfectly. I hear no humming or distortion. There is no delay. There is no BS. It's clean and simple, and CHEAP! Don't bother with any of that gold-plated, gimmicky expensive crap, magnetically shielded in pure mystery. This works perfectly and I will never use anything else!",
