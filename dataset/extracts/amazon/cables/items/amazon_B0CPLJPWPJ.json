I would buy again knowing the seller is outstanding.One is good. One cable is bad: Charges but does not sync with my computer. Bummer I paid for 2 cords and one only half works. Would not buy again because of quality control issue.",

It lasted three months. Before it died, it kept telling me there was moisture in the port. My phone was never dropped in water or even caught in the rain. Gradually, the cord quit working altogether. I get that I didn't pay much, but I expected it to last longer than three months.",
