                "reviewText": "The design of these cable ties is great - there are two different sized slots and a circular hole so you can put them around a cable in a variety of ways that will keep them in place while the cable is in use. One of the listing pictures shows the circular hole being stretched more than I would have thought possible, so I tried it on a cable with a fairly large end, and to my surprise it was able to get over it and now it stays exactly where I put it.The benefits of this type of cable tie are many - first, they do the regular job of holding your coiled cable. Next, being able to stay attached to the cable when the cable is in use is great - you never have to try to remember where you put the thing when you took it off - it's right there waiting for when it's needed. Something I hadn't expected is they can be used as a stress relief for a cable when it's plugged in (and you have something metallic nearby that you can magnet it to). The charging cable for my laptop is fairly heavy, so it pulls on the charging port. With this cable tie, I have the charger connected but the cable is being held up by the cable tie (stuck to a piece of metal on my desk) so there's no stress at all on the charging port.They're also handy as just some long magnets for magnetting stuff up on the fridge.",

                "reviewText": "I have used many things to organize/bundle/store wires, from Velcro ties, to zip ties, to wire ties. Even a Q-tip works great in a pinch if done right, just bend in half and twist around! :DWith these magnetic ties, my life entered a new chapter! Out of the box, they look somewhat silly with two encased magnets connected with two thin and stretchable silicone bands, but wait until you try them on some cables. Not only are they easy to install, they are also equally easy to remove at any time if needed. For thinner cable bundles, we can go around twice and the slight stretching of the silicone gives a tight wrap. I can stretch one around two fingers and the magnets still close the loop securely despite the slight pull. They really work well on a very wide range of bundle diameters.If there are metallic surfaces nearby, the tied cable(s) will remain in place via the magnets. Cool!As illustrated on the instructions, the small hole can easily stretch over e.g. USB plugs for permanent attachments to cables that are folded/unfolded often.",

                "reviewText": "These magnetic silicone ties are perfect to wrap around my different cords. The ties are durable, but also flexible enough that they will stretch to wrap around any small or medium cord. They have a magnet at each end to secure the tie in place when you\u2019re ready.I always like it when I get a device that has a hook and loop tie attached to the cord/cable, because I know it\u2019s going to be easy to keep it organized, and I won\u2019t lose the tie. These silicone ties offer this benefit too, and I love it. To attach the tie to a cord, slip the small round hole on the tie over one end of a cable, then slide it down. When you do that, the tie will stay attached to the cord even when you unwrap it. There are instructions for doing this with the product pictures on Amazon. There aren\u2019t any instructions with the ties.I plan on ordering more of these ties and using them for storing cords as well as for cable management. I highly recommend them.",

                "reviewText": "I am reviewing the product \"Xuuza Magnetic Cable Ties 10 Pack, Silicone Cable Ties Charging Cord Organizer\" on 21 January, 2024.As the Amazon listing highlights, these are a replacement for zip ties and velcro cable ties with compelling improvements on both of those solutions.Zip ties: single use, have to cut them to releaseVelcro ties: difficult to position, snags on various materials, hard to re-positionXuuza Magnetic Cable Ties: reusable, quick and easy to attach the first time, and to re-position as often as you need. No snags.The magnets are surprisingly strong and hold together very well. For best results, I advise reading the Amazon listing thoroughly, where detailed instructions are provided that are sadly not included in the product as delivered. Xuuza could improve the product by reproducing those instructions (which were not completely intuitive to me the first time around) in the product package.At the current asking price, this bundle costs out at a dollar per tie. Zip ties are cheaper until you need to re-position them (to accommodate an additional cable, for example), but the flexibility of the Xuuza ties is evident, and represents a good value.",

                "reviewText": "If you've tried to organize your endless number of cables, you probably have annoyances with all the different methods out there: either they're not reusable (zip ties) or flimsy (rubber bands) or hard to readjust (velcro). Retractable cords are okay, but they are usually more expensive and you have less options if you're looking for a higher level of quality. These silicone bands address all of those issues and while not perfect, they do make cable organization less painful.The band is easy to wrap around your cables, making it as tight or loose as you want. The magnet is a quick and easy way to secure them, although they are a little larger on these than my other magnetic silicone bands. Plus if you need to attach them to a magnetic surface that's also a nice feature. The hole that you can slip your cable through is a great way to keep the band with your cable while it's in use, so I appreciate that a lot.I think this is will be as close as we get to an optimal solution for organizing our ever growing cables and cords.",
