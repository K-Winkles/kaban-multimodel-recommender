However, I think it would be best suited for somewhere that it will be used infrequently but storage is a concern, like as a spare cable in a car. With the \"memory\" in the cable, it makes it hard to use at its full length and it tends to tangle up if you're not careful about how it springs back to its original shape.",

However the self coiling feature makes me want to consider skydiving with a homemade squirrel suit. It's a strong enough coil to make the cord basically un manageable. I close my eyes and shove it into the drawer on my desk, begging it to not lash out and strike me down. Again the idea was almost good but a rigid charging cable is very inconvenient and you have to be careful that it doesn't damage the port.",
