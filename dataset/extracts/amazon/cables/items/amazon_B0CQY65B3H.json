                "reviewText": "The item sort of works but is a little bit janky to get working because it's not reversible. A very important thing to note is that the data port is a host-only port. This means that if you plugged this device into your phone you could use accessories such as a keyboard or a flash drive but you wouldn't be able to transfer files from a computer or use it for Apple CarPlay as in those situations the phone would be acting as the device and the computer would be the host. Basically data can only go into the connected device but not out.",

There was no documentation as to which is for audio use and which is for power. I plugged the male connector into my iPad and then connected a power cable and a headphones cable to the two female connectors. When I put the headphones on, I cannot hear any music. But when I start to remove the headphones from my head, I can hear the music coming out of the speakers. I tried swapping what I was connecting to the two female ports and I could hear the music while they were on my head \"normally,\" but my iPad was not charging.",
