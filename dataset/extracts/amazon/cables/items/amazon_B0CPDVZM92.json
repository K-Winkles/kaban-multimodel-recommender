Hey, if you gotta do something boring like charge your Ipad/Iphone you might as well have some color lol! This length is perfect; the 3 footers are just uselessly short, and 10 foot is just too long with too much extra cord to deal with unless you are really far from that outlet! The silicon coating on these cables feels nice, and the cables seem sturdy enough to me. The silicon around the ends does seem like it would help them bend and hold up longer than older cables I have had. No way to know this for sure, but I will update review if they don\u2019t hold up. The ends go in my Ipad and my fast charging puck very smoothly. The price is pretty decent for USB-C to USB-c and considering the pretty colors. The colors also would be nice to differentiate which cable goes to which device or person. All is all, a good buy! (I do agree with other reviewer that a pair of matching color fast-charging USB-C pucks would have been nice!)",

Length is long and convenient for charging options. I do wish that there was an option to have bricks included (especially in the same colors!), as unless you plan to charge with a computer that has a USB-C port, you will need a brick with a USB-C connector to plug into an outlet, so I had to find and buy that separately (not in matching colors).",

It plugged easily into my Kindle, but was a bit more difficult to get plugged into the laptop USB-C. I really like the colors, as pink is my favorite color and purple is close behind. They are pretty shades, and so much nicer than boring white or black!",
