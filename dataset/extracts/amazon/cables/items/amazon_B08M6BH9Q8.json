I was trying to charge an Android and iPhone at the same time and it won't charge them both. The iPhone took over and my Android wouldn't charge even though it was plugged in. I tried both iPhone cords and tried switching which way the Android charger was plugged in and that didn't fix the problem. So it's nice to have a multi-device charging cord just know it won't charge more than one device at a time.",
