It 's really convenient to use different lengths of cables at the bedside or at the desk. Usually I replaced the kindle paperwhite charging cable with it and it was able to charge my old stereo very quickly. (Btw, what surprised me is that these cables support data transmission and the transmission speed is satisfactory. I bought another cable once, but it does not support data transmission, and that\u2019s why I need to buy an extra cable that supports data transmission.) They are strong cables as well, my cat has nibbled on these cords many times, but they are still working fine. I 'm surprised such a cheap price brings a reliable quality.",

                "reviewText": "Included in the package are two 1.5' and one 3' and a 6' USB to micro-usb cable. At least in my house, it seems like we are using microUSB devices less these days, but it also means that we have fewer of these cables laying around to use on our older devices that use these.The cables worked for data transfer and power charging, and are braided black/white as shown in the listing. The actual connectors feel well built, but don't appear to have any extra reinforcement joining the cable and the usb or micro-usb socket, where they most commonly fail.But the value on these is very good for the current price. I think it's a great deal overall, just as long as you aren't expecting super-reinforced/heavy-duty connectors.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice set of very inexpensive Micro USB charger cables. There are a lot of devices using this plug. Four cables: two 1.5 foot, one 3 foot, one 6 foot lengths cover almost all situations. A bargain. I tested all four cables, and they performed well. When bent, the cable stays in that position, so coiling for storage of extra wire is straight forward. It has a braided cover, which helps when handling. There is no flexibility at the head joint where the wire enters, which will likely be a point of failure if exposed to harsher treatment. I give this set of charging cables a 4.",

Quality seems comparable to other 'woven fabric' jacketed USB cables I've used previouslyCable came packaged in a handy baggie that was separated into pouches for the separate lengths. so far, the 'kinks' that are in the cable from being bundled are still there, but I'd expect they will smooth out over time.Its definitely handy to have a few lengths to choose from. We have a 6x port charging station in my house where I like to use short cables (so kids can't play tablets on the chargers, they have to put their screen down and do something else) so the variety was helpful.My kids are pretty tough on their micro-USB and USB-C cables, so I will follow up on this review regarding the cable's longevity, although the build quality of the cable seemed pretty solid.",

I\u2019ve had no direct contact with Amazon Vine or the manufacturer and these opinions are my own.These cables feel well built and have held up so far! Only time will tell, but I think they'll last a while.",

                "reviewText": "I seem to burn through micro USB cables quickly, so I'm always picking up more.These seem much better than the cheap cables I usually grab - I'm only charging things like a Kindle or old Samsung tablet, so rarely worried about fast charging or data speeds. These work fine for that.They are stiff and a little harder to wrap up if you travel with them versus just leaving them on your deck, but hoping that means better durability as well.I'll update if I encounter any issues, but so far they seem completely functional and inexpensive.",

                "reviewText": "Comes in three lengths that are all USB A to micro USB. I took the opportunity to grab some extra USB micro cables because I have a number of devices that still use the micro USB standard rather than the new prefered USB C connections. These are getting hard to find these days. Grab some spares so you can keep your USB micro devices charged.I knew these were wrapped in a nylon braid, but did not expect them to be quite as stiff as they are, but with use they will \"wear in.\" I am pretty happy with these - both ends fit my devices and chargers well.",
