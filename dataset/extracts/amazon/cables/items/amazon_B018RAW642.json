The main reason I wasn't completely happy with this cable was that instead of using a dedicated black/blue wire for \"ground\", they just used uninsulated stranded wire for that (made it less straightforward to crimp onto other wire). Otherwise, as expected with other Monoprice offerings, this was a nice cable in terms of compact and sturdy-appearing plug ends. I realize that my use case is unusual, and most USB cables do not specify the internal cable component wires, but in 2023 it's probably more common to buy these for weird DIY stuff than before alternatives like USB-C were common.",

I coated the contacts with dielectric grease and so far so good. It's been a couple months now on an exposed face without issue.The quality of the cord is good and the ends are nice and small. Some cables have massive ends that make fitting into ports difficult or impossible. Not this one. I'll probably look into getting more of these cables to use with my gadget charging station.",

It worked perfectly, powering up and charging the dash cam without any issues so far. I was able to wrap and hide the cable around the front window then side of the car to the middle console without any issues. It was the perfect length with a little extra slack. We'll see if it survives winter but I'm pretty confident it will be alright. If not, I will update this review.",
