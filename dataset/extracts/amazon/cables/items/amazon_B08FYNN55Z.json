                "reviewText": "Since the iPhone switched to USB-C for charging, it's good to have some extra long, sturdy USB A-to-C cables around, and I was happy to find this many 6' long reinforced cables for such a low price. I tested them all on arrival, and they all had snug connections and could both charge and transfer data to my phone. The braided cables are nice and stiff and the connectors have some reinforcement. They look like they'll hold up.It's important to understand what you're getting. These aren't USB-C to USB-C. They can't deliver super-fast charging. They aren't designed for charging high power-draw devices like laptops. And they are as slow as it gets when it comes to data transfer.BUT fast charging and high-speed data aren't always what you need. These cables help you make use of all the older USB-A chargers you have, and are perfect for overnight or slower charging (slow charging is not a bad thing... it's probably a lot easier on your phone's circuitry because nothing gets hot).And of course these A-to-C cables are handy for connecting to your car, for charging from your laptop, from an old power bank, or for charging small USB-C devices like earbuds and power banks. For the price, it's good to have 5 of these around. The 5 Stars is for value. If they don't last long, I'll deduct stars later.",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased these a couple times. I have four kids, plus I like to have cords in the cars and several rooms in the house.They are good value and the colors are true to the pics. Having three multiple colors helps everyone know who owns each cord.They are not as flexible as some, but they are not too bad. I will say that after about a year I have started having several go bad. The first ones were my kids since they are tougher on things, but my wife and I have had ours begin to stop working as well and we use them a lot but are fairly gentle with things.When they broke, the price and quality made it worth me buying them again. You can get nicer cords, but even those will break at some point with use and these have been a good quality for the price.",

The cables are incredibly sturdy and will last long, even with frequent use. The price is also very reasonable, especially considering the top-notch quality of the cords.I was also impressed with the quick shipping; the cables arrived in perfect condition, undamaged, and ready to use. While these cables may not charge my phone as quickly as some other chargers, they still do the job and charge my phone completely.Due to their high-quality construction and reliability, these cables are perfect for traveling or as a backup charger. I recommend these cables to anyone looking for a dependable charging solution that will last years.",

The length is really good for night stands. We can lay in bed and still charge the phone. I have also tried these in a car and they work well with both Android Auto and Apple Car Play. They were a little long for a car. I would typically use a 3ft in a car and not a 6ft cable. Overall good cables for the money.",
