                "reviewText": "These cords do the job or replacing hdmi cables with adapters attached. The thing I like is how all the ports on graphics cards can be used with these cords and they look nice too. I have had to even whittle away at hdmi cable heads to get them to fit onto graphics cards with other connectors present. The other think I like is that this does not have those annoying princers which grasp onto the graphic card interior. It is easy to pull these on and off the card. Overall, these cords are useful for having hdmi monitors attached to a graphics card with DP ports.",
