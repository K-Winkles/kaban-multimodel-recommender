                "reviewText": "Rcvd my first ones as a Christmas gift, and ordered more. The fact that they come with all 3 device adaptors is really nice (micro/usbc/iphone). Nice strong cables and if your like me, and forget your item is plugged in and 'grab-n-go', having it gently unplug is a big plus.The various lengths of cables are really nice. The 3' cable is just right for the car and on the counter. The 4' and 6' cables are nice for the sofa and chairs. I have plenty of room to relax and enjoy the phone/kindle.What I don't like: The magnetic connector looses it hold if I'm holding the phone (sometimes against my body) and stops charging (I hear the ding) and I have to reposition it away from me so it doesn't rub/touch me.I find the charging not as fast as my regular usb cables, but for overnight and while in the car it works great. I have looked and cannot find the same magnetic usb connector (that goes into the device) separately that will plug into my previous usb-c cords into the magnetic usb of this same style. Because I have so many (I just purchased several new before the holidays) usb-c cables, I'd like to have adapted to the magnetic style. The same style is the key, as I have seen others but they are oval not round.If anyone has found any of the round usb connectors (without cords) please let me know, I'd like to get a few.",

                "reviewText": "Jan 2023 - Had these about a month. 2 problems so far, but love them overall. Most of my other cords get kinked near the connection point due to my kids using their devices. These have solved that problem with their amazing ability to articulate in virtually any direction, and if my kids try to position their device that's beyond what these are designed for the magnets simply pull apart. The magnets seem to have plenty of strength to maintain the connection, but not too much where it pulls the connector out of the device or damage the cable (common problems with similar magnetic charging cables). I have a Spigen Tough Armor case, and the adapters fit nicely into the connection cutout.First problem: One of the lightning (iOS, iPhone) adapters already failed after about a week. It simply wouldn't work with any of the cables, in any device, and I tried installing it both ways in multiple devices. Fortunately, there were multiple lightning adapters.Second problem: It claims to be capable of \"fast charging\", but I have not seen that happen. I have two fast charging blocks that I use regularly. I have tried each cable in both chargers, and they do not charge any faster than any standard charging block I use them in. Not a huge problem because I can still fast charge my phone by removing the adapter and using my old USB C to lightning cable, but these cables are advertised as fast charging capable.I bought these for $20. I'd probably buy them again at that price.",

                "reviewText": "Summary - Charging is extremely slow; data connection is problematic.I bought these in May 2023 for my Samsung S22 phone and for my wife's Apple Lightning devices. My idea was to use it in the car so we could share a cable.The charging speed on these is much slower than a Lightning or USB-C cable. It literally shows 4 to 5 hours for charging when a direct cable shows 1-2 hours.The data connection is problematic, as just rotating the cable while holding it in the device causes it to drop and come back repeatedly. Picking up or moving the device results in a dropped data connection. That is an issue with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Hitting a bump in the road disconnects the phones.I used the manufacturer's website form to request support over a month ago, but have not received so much as a confirmation my request was received.On the plus side, the magnets are strong. I use one for my wireless keyboard and it pulls the connector right out. I have to use two hands or pull the cable out sideways to break the connection.Last I checked, Android or Apple devices are pretty common phones and tablets so I don't know who this product is for.If you leave it on overnight or don't need fast charging, then this might work for you.",

                "reviewText": "I rarely write reviews, but these cables have impressed me that much. Shortly after I bought these I landed in the hospital. I took the 10 foot cable with me. Over the 4 months I was there, the cable was well tested. It was pushed, pulled, knotted and tied, accidentally yanked out of the wall socket many times, run over by the tray table and caught up in the bed(which I kept it lightly tied to. ). I was moved to 7 different rooms on 3 different hospitals, each time the cable was quickly crumpled up in order to move. I\u2019m now home and the cable is still working perfectly.One handy feature of these cables is that they work for power AND data. Most magnetic connect cables can\u2019t do that. It saves having to remove the dongle from tha phone\u2019s power socket in order to use an old style cable.The hinged connector on the phone end of the cable means the cable isn\u2019t in your way if you need to use your device while it\u2019s charging.As for speed, I have nothing to compare to, but my iPhone 13 charges in about 2 and a half hours.With one 10 foot, one 6 foot and two 3 foot cables, you\u2019re pretty well covered. There are also 2 dongles for each phone type so you cand share as well as mix and match depending on what brand you own. I\u2019ve bought more as gifts be cause they\u2019re a good value. You can\u2019t go wrong with these cables",
