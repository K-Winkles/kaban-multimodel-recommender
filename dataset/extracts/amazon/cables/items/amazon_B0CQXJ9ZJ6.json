While the cord is magnetic, there\u2019s not much reason or benefit for it\u2014it does not self-wind like the listing states. I got this for that reason to help detangle the web of wires and chargers around my charging port. Yet, it\u2019s just another wire for the most part.Also, the lighting cord head is too big and it\u2019s not compatible with my phone case, which is frustrating. However, I can still use it with my AirPods.Thanks for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful.",

                "reviewText": "The Magtame Magnetic iPhone Charger Cord is a great option for anyone looking for a durable, tangle-free, and fast-charging cable for their iPhone. The magnetic connector is a real game-changer, and the braided cable is both stylish and practical.Pros:Magnetic connector: The magnetic connector is the best feature of this cable. It's incredibly easy to use, and it snaps into place with a satisfying click. No more fumbling around with a tiny Lightning connector!Tangle-free: The coiled design of the cable makes it tangle-free, which is a huge plus. I've never had to deal with a tangled mess of cords with this cable.Fast charging: The cable supports fast charging, so you can quickly charge your iPhone. I was able to charge my iPhone 13 Pro from 0% to 50% in about 30 minutes.Durable: The braided cable is very durable, and it's resistant to fraying and tearing. I've been using this cable for a few months now, and it shows no signs of wear and tear.MFi certified: The cable is MFi certified, which means it's been approved by Apple for use with iPhones and iPads.3.3FT length: The 3.3FT length is perfect for everyday use. It's not too long, so it won't get in the way, but it's long enough to reach comfortably from a wall outlet to your bed or couch.Cons:Price: The cable is a bit more expensive than some other options on the market. However, I think the premium features, such as the magnetic connector and the braided cable, make it worth the price.Bulky connector: The magnetic connector is a bit bulky, and it can make it difficult to use some cases. I had to remove my iPhone case in order to use the cable.Verdict:Overall, I'm very happy with the Magtame Magnetic iPhone Charger Cord. It's a well-made, durable, and fast-charging cable that makes charging my iPhone a breeze. If you're looking for a premium charging cable, I highly recommend the Magtame.Here are some additional things to consider:The cable comes in three colors: silver, black, and blue.The cable is also available in a 5FT length.Magtame offers a lifetime warranty on the cable.I hope this review helps you decide if the Magtame Magnetic iPhone Charger Cord is right for you.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great cable to keep things tidy. The magnet does add a little bit of weight to it but not as much as you might expecting. For the price you\u2019d expect a premium cable and thats sure what you\u2019re getting here. The lightning connecter casing is on the larger side which may prove an obstruction for those with a thicker case.Testing this cable\u2019s charging current and it does match the stated 2.4 amps current reaching 2.369 amps in my tests. Or just over 12 watts.After using this for a week, I\u2019ve been keeping it in my work bag and the magnetic nature of this cable has kept it coiled up and refrained it from getting tangled with other cables/objects. Overall it\u2019s a great cable but ver expensive for what you get. If this cable was 2-3meter length it would be easier to justify but at only 1 meter the amount it gets tangles is limited. If you have the funds you won\u2019t be disappointed but each time I pull it out my bag I can\u2019t help but think it\u2019s not work around 4 times the cost to save me maybe a minute of untangling it from other cables.",

Ha una particolare funzione,altrimenti sarebbe come uno dei tanti cavi che abbiamo a casa. Ha una qualit\u00e0 costruttiva molto alta,riesce ad supportare fine a 60w di ricarica e trasmettere dati fino a 480mbs. Per cui un cavo di qualit\u00e0.E fin qui tutto bene, poi ti capita di provare una soluzione magnetica e ti cambia tutto. Fin quel momento che ti rendi conto che avevi bisogno di una soluzione cos\u00ec. Il cavo rimane nella posizione che lo lasci,lo puoi dare tutte le forme che desideri e lui mantiene la sua forma. Semplice ma geniale.Non riesco ad trovare un difetto su questo prodotto. \u00c8 costruito molto bene,ha prestazioni sia per la ricarica veloce che sul trasferimento dei dati e come bonus ha la funzione magnetica che ti facilita la vita. Non posso che consigliare!",

                "reviewText": "I have tons of other braided USB-C charging cables which usually require the use of cable ties to keep them neatly stored when not in use, this however is my first magnetic USB-C charging cable which does not require cable ties as the magnetic braided cord folds itself up into a compact coil.The nylon braided coil is flexible & much more durable than the rubberised silicone USB-C charging cables including the original Apple USB-C charging cables which always split, this makes this a more cost effective option than having to regularly buy endless replacements.As I own multiple devices I always keep some spare charging cables on standby to instantly replace any worn out cables when they should occur & without keeping them neatly organised they swiftly become an entangled mess which then requires time to unravel, these magnetic versions organise themselves without me having to buy additional products to keep them tidy.Neither of the USB connection ends themselves are magnetic as they are with a MacBook charging cable, only the braided cable part is actually magnetic.",
