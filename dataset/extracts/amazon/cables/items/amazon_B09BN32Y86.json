Getting all those cables and wall warts organized (?) creates a tangled mess in whatever corner of the house is set aside as the charging station, and uses up every available outlet. Stuffing them all in a drawer is even worse. But, there is a solution! Get an Anker Charger, 60W 6 Port Charging Station (or similar product) and THESE cables. Each cable has a USB-C, Mini Android, and iPhone terminal on one end and a standard USB connector on the other. We set up two of these; one in our office another in the corner of the dining room. Problem solved! This arrangement replaces three separate cables and only occupies one outlet. The cables themselves are color coded, soft, and have a braided covering. Highly recommended.",

So I was super happy to find this cable that would hopefully solve all of my phone charging needs at an affordable price. Well, if it seems too good to be true, then it probably is too good to be true. My wife's iPhone doesn't always work with the cable, which is annoying. And when I plugged this cable into my Super Fast Charger, it only charges at normal speeds, which means that this cable is only good for regular charging, not Super Fast or even Fast charging speeds. Not sure why they're saying 60W because I can't get it to charge my Samsung S23 Ultra at faster than 10W... Disappointed.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Much easier than carrying multiple charging cables with different tips",
                "reviewText": "I purchased this packaged pair of charging cables so that I could give one to a relative who has multiple devices and a confusing array of chargers and cables. This simplified things greatly - just one (multi-tipped) cable for them to carry. I kept the other one as a backup to the set of cables I tend to travel with, since those could be damaged, lost or stolen. However, I don't use mine frequently, as the cables sometimes aren't long enough to reach from a wall socket to where I am, and when I do use it that's mostly when I'm just confirming that it still works. Since a pair of these multi-tipped cables only cost slightly more than one of the single-tipped cables I saw offered, I consider it a good deal.The outer layer of the cables is a braided fabric that allows them to slide over things better than the usual plastic-wrapped cables, and it resists pinching/squeezing well. The splitter/combiner (where the three cable tips separate out from the source cable) seems sturdy, and the source cable should be long enough to reach from most vehicles' dash to a charging port in the center console. I haven't tried to stress the cables to their breaking point, but they certainly seem durable enough to hold up under regular daily use. Connected to a 140-watt USB-C wall charger (via a USB-C to USB-A adapter), it charged a USB-C mobile 'phone (that was powered off) quite rapidly, with no detectable heating in the cable. I've heard no complaints from the person who received the other one of the pair, so for me this is definitely worth it.",
