                "reviewText": "I hadn't seen coiled USB C cables before so I decided to give these a try. They are of high quality especially the connectors at each end. The included clips to hold the cables together is a nice touch. Unstretched length is about 1 foot. I only see 2 flaws. First, the connectors hold themselves pretty well when plugged into ports but the useable length is not 3 feet but more like just under 2.5 feet. The coils are made pretty tight so that you can't get to 3 feet before the cable pulls out of a port. Second, if you stretch the cable in a direction perpendicular to the direction that it goes into a port (see photos), there is quite a bit of tension on the connection. I'm afraid that this might damage the port (or connector) over time. Otherwise the cables do the jobs they were designed to do.",

                "reviewText": "So first, I did receive two USB-C to USB-C cables which were about a foot in length but stretchable for a considerable 3-4ft in lengthThese were perfect for my minivan where the driver and passenger often vie for cable ports and space.It did deliver power from car to both devices (a S23 & a Pixel), but... I did not see either device \"fast charging\". A fast charger can bring me from 0 to 100% in an hour+ but this cable was detected to charge from 0 to 100 in 5 hours +Super fast charging occurs at 45w, and this was supposed to transfer 60w. I'll test further but I just wanted to put that out there.",

It's a good cord, and great price for the 2 pack. My only issue is that it's so tightly wound, it really only extends about 2 feet, not the advertised 3 feet.",
