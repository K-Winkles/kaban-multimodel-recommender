First, they're beautiful (which, with my amps showing, looks plays a big part).A little stiff when first opened, but after working them a bit, they become more flexible and super easy to run through my car.Being as thin as they are, I was a bit skeptical, but once I installed everything and fired it up, the SQ is absolutely top notch. These guys are easily worth 3 times as much.ZERO noise interference (of course if you take precaution running cables properly and getting a good ground, noise should never be an issue).Connectors are small but seat firmly and are solidly built.For the price, there's no way you could find a better cable. Grab them before the price jumps!Seller is great, arrived before expected. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been looking for a decent rca cable to replace all of my mismatched cables without breaking the bank. I figure for the price I'd give them a shot. They\u2019re working out great! Anyone who deals with old tube stuff knows how close they put the rca connections to each other due to smaller cable ends. These fit perfectly without having to fight the cable ends in. The 2 into one wire is nice for routing the wire cleanly.Due to the thickness I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t have great shielding. However I don\u2019t hear any noise coming from them so far and they are running next to power cords. So far so good.",
