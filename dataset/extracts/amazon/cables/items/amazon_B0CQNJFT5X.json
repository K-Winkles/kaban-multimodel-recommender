                "reviewText": "I had the coiled aviator style cables on my mechanical keyboard for gaming but I noticed it had a slight lag to it. The coiled keyboard usb's might look good but are simple 3-pin uses. This type-c to type-c is 24 pins, capable of power transmission as well as high speed data. Still have to look of braided and coiled cable but zero latency. Looks really good on my desktop with the longer cable going to my GMMK Pro and the shorter hooked up to my GMMK Numpad. If you want to use it for charging it's capable of 100w, which is almost 4x's the speed of the fastest charging tech. So basically, it's future proof for at least the foreseeable future. Anything faster for data or for audio/video, I'd go with a thunderbolt but if you're just looking for a top of the line type-c charging or basic data connection, this is the next best thing. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Here we have a great design for USB-C power cables, but they are let down by a couple of features.First, the texture of this cable is... weird. I don't know what you'd call it, but it instantly makes your hands feel bone dry, it's like they're coated in power or something. It's not super pleasant. Second, there are no marking on the cable of it's capabilities. 3 weeks from now I'm not going to remember they are supposed to be 100W cables. I automatically knock 1 star off cables that don't carry the super important feature of having printed directly on them what they are capable of. I use a small label maker to mark all of my cables before I forget, but I shouldn't have to.The 3rd problem is, the longer cable of the two I received doesn't seem to want to provide 100W, or even 45W. When paired with a known good 100W USB-C charger and a Galaxy Tab S9, which can pull up to 45W, that cable has issues. After initially sending power it causes charging to shut down, and the tablet/power supply renegotiate the lower rating of just 15W, and then it charges the tablet at that, normally. The shorter cable runs at ~43W on the same charger/tablet, which is what I expect to see.So, minor quality control issue aside, these aren't terrible cables, but I probably won't order more of these and will keep looking for coiled cables elsewhere.",

Hopefully it can handle the temp changes and the extreme heat in the summers since it will be in the car 24/7. Time will tell how durable it will be.",
