I've been involved in live music for 30 years and this is one of the best cables I've ever seen. Cable diameter is thicker than any mic cable I can remember seeing and the connectors look top quality. I'm using this cable to run from my DI on my pedal board to my PA and the sound quality is noticeably better than the cable it replaced. If you are wondering about this cable, put your worries to rest.",

                "reviewText": "I have typically use GLS XLR cables in the past but I just added an SVS PB4000 subwoofer to my system and thought I'd try these from Monoprice since their amps are an outstanding value for the money and I wanted to make sure really get my money's worth from the PB4000. When I took the cables out of the package my initial reaction was great. They appeared to be very well made and the quality of the materials appeared superior to the GLS cables I've been using. However, when I went to plug in the male pin end, it wouldn't fit, which seemed very usual, as they usually slide in with minimal resistance. I thought maybe I just needed to take a closer look, that my visual alignment was off. It wasn't. When I looked into the end of the cable the pins were obviously misaligned with the outer ring. I was able to bend them into position when the cable seems to work fine, but I'd have to say that was disappointing to see and not what I expected at all from a brand with great reputation that I've had great experience with the past. The other cable was fine. I may have just received a one in a million quality control miss, but none the less, it happened. Again, the cable ended performing well after I bent the pins back into alignment and I'd still rate them a great value and they are built of good quality materials. The lack of quality control just threw me a bit.",
