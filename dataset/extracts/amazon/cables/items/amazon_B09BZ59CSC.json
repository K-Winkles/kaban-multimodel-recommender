The braided sections are very well knit together and helps more flexibility. Over time the standard cables get discolored and sticky but this is almost a cloth feeling and stays perfectly in shape. It also matches well with my car interior and looks uniform with the molding on the pillars. I would highly recommend this product. The speed of charging and connectivity is great. I am using it for fast charging and also car play. The only issue I have is that I misplaced one of the two cables it comes with in the box. Not sure where it's gone! The seller is great to work with and they offer support as needed.",
