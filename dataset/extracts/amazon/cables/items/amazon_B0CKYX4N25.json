Built for Speed and Reliable Connectivity The Internet cable is capable of transmitting data at speeds of up to 1.0 Gbps with increased transmission frequencies of up to 250 MHz. It is constructed with 4 twisted pairs (UTP) of copper wires, with RJ45 connectors at both ends of the cable. Compared to the Cat 5e patch cord, the more stringent specifications and improved quality in twisting of the wires provide better protection from crosstalk, noise, and interference. Wide Compatibility Supports most devices with RJ45 jacks, including computers, routers, switch boxes, network printers, modems, smart TVs, PS3, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox 360 and more; Backwards compatible with Cat5 & Cat5e.",

Tab stays firmly in it's connection.Being flat also makes it extremely easy to label/write on. In the midst of lot's of cables it's easy to tell where it leads to.One thing I didn't care for was the way it was packed. It was folded in half and then rolled making it a pain to unravel. Now it wouldn't be so bad if it was 10', but I ordered the 60'",

The connection has been consistent and fast, with no noticeable signal loss or interference.In fact, I've been so impressed with the cable's performance that I've already bought two of them and am considering purchasing even more. The cable's length allows for greater flexibility in positioning my devices around the house, making it a versatile choice for any home network setup.In conclusion, if you're looking for a reliable and high-quality Ethernet cable, look no further. This Cat6 cable has exceeded my expectations and continues to provide the consistent, high-speed connection I desire.",
