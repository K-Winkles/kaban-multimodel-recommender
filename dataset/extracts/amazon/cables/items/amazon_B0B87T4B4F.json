Then I borrowed my mom\u2019s cord and of course it worked PERFECTLY!!! Keep in mind I have \u201cautomatic updates\u201d turned OFF so keeping that off has PROVEN that they still do push some kind of updates through somehow\u2026. Anyways I bought these and they work perfectly and I\u2019m definitely happy with the price as well!!! I HATE the fact that Apple does this on purpose with their little secret updates which cause the cords not to work so you have to BUY MORE!!! Super annoying and proves what kind of a company they are!!!",
