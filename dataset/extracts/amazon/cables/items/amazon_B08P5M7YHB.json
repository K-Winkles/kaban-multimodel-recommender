                "reviewText": "Hi. So yes this product is perfect for people who have all different types of charging devices limited to the lightning cable type c and the micro sd ports. But if you're the type of person who is on your device as well it's charging this product will not last more than 3 months. I purchased this in March and it is now June. And I have used both of them for one specific cord and now it no longer charges unless it's in an awkward position. The other cables however work perfectly fine as I do not use those as often. Furthermore (And this is not to reflect on the product but more for those who need more feedback on my purchase) do not underestimate how long 10 feet is. Being so used to the included charger of 3 to 4 ft I went all out and got this one but found that it is much too long and I wind up coiling it up more often than using the inches for my benefit. I think a six or seven foot cable would be better suited for my needs. Lastly I believe my phone could tell that it was not the given charger and therefore I could not get it to fast charge but it still charged pretty fast. With that being said it works perfectly just don't expect it to work perfectly long term if you've been bending the cable at the port while it's connected. I thought the woven material around the cable would prevent this but it did not. I will just get a new one and refrain from using it this way. Thank you for you time. Enjoy!",

                "reviewText": "While searching for chargers that would fit the needs of our electronics I came across this particular charger. Prior, our issue was having multiple electronics needing to be charged at the same time for convenience but not enough outlets in a particular area for that. Packaging is organized and easily anssessable, as each charger comes in its own section. If we only need one, we only have to take one out and the others are still protected. I love the fabric wire covering which prevents breakage in certain connection areas, mainly the transition on the cord from wire to actual charger head. I believe this lead to the longevity regarding durability. I have an iPhone and this charger will charge my dead phone to 100% in about an hour or a little less. We even bought the longer cord to fit our needs. You won\u2019t be disappointed by this charger.",

They are constantly asking me, if I have a charger, then I find myself searching just to find out the one that I found will not work on the device they are currently using. I used a permanent marker and colored a 1/2 inch of each cord and gave each grandchild a different color. They now have a charger that will work all their devices. These have made life so much easier!",

                "reviewText": "I bought these because I had a 3 prong cord for a couple of years that I kept in my car before it finally got lost. I ordered this because it was a 2-pack and I figured if one broke quickly based on the reviews, the other would last a little while. Why did we have problems with both just a few days after the return window closed???I ordered them April 25. My charger started getting real weak and slow towards the end of May. Went from getting a full charge for my Samsung Galaxy S21 from 0% in 2 hours to it taking 6. I guess. I never could leave it plugged in for 6 hours. I kept this one next to the couch so my boyfriend could also charge his iPhone from the same plug. (Note: you can't charge two phones at once, but I figured that before buying.) Well, the plug for the iPhone snapped off in early June, about 5 weeks after purchase. I asked my boyfriend about his cord and he said it now takes forever to charge as well.So this goes down as one of the worst things I've ever bought on Amazon. Total waste of money.",

                "reviewText": "I recently went on a long car trip and we were short connectors for all of the devices in the car so we were constantly swapping cables and waiting to charge one device or another. We had older apple devices, old micro-USB devices as well as a couple of USB-C devices. After the trip, I thought it would be good to convert all of our cables to longer triple connector cables so that no matter what is needed we have the solution. I also added 2 extra cables in the car. While I have to say that we now have a plethora of connectors in the car which is a bit daunting, if/when we do another longer car trip we will definitely be set.As for the over all quality of the cable, the braiding on the cable is quite nice, also I can say that these are the first cables that actually click in on a USB-C cable. One might note that the micro-usb is also very tight, and I had a cheapo bluetooth speaker that the connector pulled out of and destroyed, so you might want to be carefull of that. However, I think for the apple and USB-C it should be great. The cables seem to provide good power if you have a device that is providing higher power, so I can fast charge if I want to. All in all, I like these cables and would definitely recommend them.",
