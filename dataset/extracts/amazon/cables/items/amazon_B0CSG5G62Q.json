                "reviewText": "Thought I would replace a 3 year old cheap flat panel antenna pulled in 46 channels - but did not consistently pull in core channels to watch play offs. So I bought this with its 600 mile range hype to bring in a local CBS and ABC channel. It didn't even find the channels on the initial scan - it only found 33 of the previous 46 channels. Moving the antenna around didn't help. Additionally, the package was generic - no brand listed, unsealed box, with cheap graphics. So you might say the packaging matched the performance. The antenna itself was smaller than expected compared to the graphics in the add, and appeared to be made of low quality plastic. 600 mile \"range\" might be square mile coverage - which works out to @ a 20-25 mile range at most.",

                "reviewText": "I have had a USB TV tuner for years. The one I have now came with a simple 9\" single pole antenna. It works, kinda. All of the Kansas City T transmitters are basically south of me about 20 miles. Unfortunately, my apartment's only outside walls face east and west. The itty-bitty antenna works for a couple of stations, but not that well. So I decided to upgrade, and this one seemed to be the best value. I just got it today, and it works for the most part. A few of the stations still lag and pixelate. I think if I move the antenna outside so there are no other apartments between me and the transmitters I should be fine. I will update tomorrow.",
