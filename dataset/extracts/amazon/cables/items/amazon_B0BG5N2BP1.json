                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using these cables for almost 4 months and the length is so much better than the one that came with my phone. Phone charges fast with this cable and my fast charging plug. My phone doesn\u2019t feel hot while charging, only slightly warm if I\u2019m using it while it\u2019s charging. They seem really durable too. They\u2019re little stiffer than the apple ones so they don\u2019t bend as much at the connection point where the white Apple ones usually start to break and fray. Really pleased with them so far.",

I had to buy another pack which is when I purchased these, I actually hid some of them from my kids but the ones that are in use are great! Durable, long and do not heat up my phone or equipment. Once my kids find my stash of hidden cords I will be back to buy another pack.",
