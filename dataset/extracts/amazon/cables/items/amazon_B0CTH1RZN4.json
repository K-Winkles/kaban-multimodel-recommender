                "reviewText": "As I've slowly upgraded my AV equipment, I've discovered my existing HDMI cables, while high quality, weren't designed for 4K. Everything has to be 4K all the way through, from the HDMI device to my AV receiver, and from the receiver to the television monitor. As I add new devices, I have to replace the existing cables. I was looking for something affordable, while still having the bandwidth needed for modern equipment: High bandwidth HDMI passes video, sound, and ethernet.I'm really happy with the results from this cable and have ordered a bunch of them in different sizes. They all have the same build quality, with a rugged braided jacket and rubber strain relief. I was a little surprised that the different size cables are actually made with different diameter wires but they all work as expected. All of the audio dropouts I've experienced, as well as periodic warning messages about not meeting HDCP or 4K standards have gone away. With the 8K rating of these cables I hope I'll be able to use them well into the future.",

I noted that it has a red plastic body inside the connector. As I'm not that familiar with 8K HDMI video cables, I don't know if that's \"standard\" (the way blue is commonly used to designate USB3) or if that is just a random color.In any case, it looks like it will do the job for which it was designed, as it appears to have substantial, well manufactured components and a braided cable with decent strain reliefs molded into the softer plastic and metal housing ends.",
