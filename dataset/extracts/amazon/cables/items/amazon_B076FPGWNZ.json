                "reviewText": "These are some of the nicest USB cables I've ever seen. The braiding is top quality, the cable ends are incredibly rugged, and the rubber for \"strain relief\" is at a nice length and a solid addition for a cable's longevity.I ordered the 10FT as I intended to use these with controllers for couch gaming. So far they fit and work with most standard controllers(Xbox Series X, Switch Pro Controller, PS5, etc.), however this cable did not fit my GameSir G7 SE controller BUT it did fit the GameSir T4 Kaleid(albeit VERY TIGHTLY). I am blaming the port design from GameSir for being too tight fitting, however this is a good reminder that even though things are moving to USB-C, it doesn't mean that all cables will fit all devices physically, so be careful!I will definitely buy more of these cables if I need more in the future.",
