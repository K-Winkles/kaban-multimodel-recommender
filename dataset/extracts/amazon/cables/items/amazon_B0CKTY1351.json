                "reviewText": "These ties are about 12 inches in length and are thick and strong. They seem to be made of a slightly softer nylon that makes them much easier to bend and work with than others. They do not stretch however so there\u2019s no tradeoff. They ratchet down tightly and held some heavy steel rods firmly. The step locks are deep enough that there is no slip back or bending in the binding no matter how hard I pulled. The extra length trims easily. At a rating or 45 lbs they will well serve the majority of jobs.",
