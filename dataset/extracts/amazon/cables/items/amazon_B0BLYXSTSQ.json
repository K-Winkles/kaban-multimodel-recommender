                "reviewText": "A lot of braided USB-C charging cords are stiffer than one might expect. The current (2023) braided cords from Anker, for example, are more cumbersome to use than they should be.This cord is thinner and lighter than others, but very durable. It is easy to coil and pack, but it unwraps into its full, untangled length with little effort. It also moves around easily, so if you are using something on a couch or bed and want to reposition things from time to time its a much better option than other cords.The cord is thin and durable because a) it supports a standard USB 2.0 data rate and b) it provides a very useable but not excessive 60W of power. This is perfect. If you need the fastest charging possible, then just get a short cord for that and get this one for when you want to be plugged in for a while as you use the device.",

The braided cables are well-constructed, featuring durable connectors and a sturdy, tangle-free design. Their 3.3ft length is great for bedside charging. They support fast charging and data transfer, ensuring efficient device synchronization. I haven't tried a data transfer yet but I do get rapid charging on the pixel 7pro.
