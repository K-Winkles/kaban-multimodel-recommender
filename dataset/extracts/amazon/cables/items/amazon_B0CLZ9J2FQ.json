                "reviewText": "These do what they claim. There's a number of other options out there but these were the smallest/sleekest, especially for the sideways one, so I gave them a try.They plug in really tight, both on the male end going into your device, and the female end accepting a cable/device. This can be really nice since you don't want adapters like this to be loose or flimsy. On the other hand they can be tough to remove. The female side is a bit more forgiving, so I imagine if you accidentally snagged a cable, it would pull out cleanly on that end.I don't really have anything that can push the power and data rates to the max, but did confirm they work up to 10Gbps and ~35W. No reason to believe they'd have any issues reaching the advertised rates of 40Gbps/240W. I don't have any USB-C displays, so couldn't test that.I used an external USB-C NVMe drive/enclosure to test the data throughput. I had a lot of problems getting the drive to show up when using either adapter. It would detect the drive but sometimes throw errors (a device which does not exist was specified) when trying to access it. Ultimately it did show up and speeds were the same both with and without the adapter, but it was concerning that it took so long to get it to work. Had the problem on two different computers, and always worked fine without the adapter. Maybe it was something else, but it didn't seem that way. I don't plan on using these for any type of external drive so it doesn't concern me, but figured it was worth mentioning.All other devices I tried this with - power input for laptop and a phone, mouse/keyboard/headset, simple thumb drives, etc - worked just fine. Same goes for a USB-C hub with other devices then plugged into that.Overall I'm pleased with these. Besides the issues with the external NVME drive, they did everything else I expected, exactly as advertised. They're compact and look good. They're also very snug for a secure connection.",

The downward force of the cable is no longer creating that twisting tension inside the port, meaning it will last longer.There is no loss of charging power (i.e. no low-power warnings), and I'm still getting about 320Mbps data speed from my LAN, which is what it is supposed to be. I'm very glad I purchased this little device.",
