                "reviewText": "So far it works great when the wire before it being a 1.3 standard was not working so well with frames of video dropping I knew I had to replace my hdmi cable. I bought another brand that was future ready just like this flat one and it didn't work, my thoughts that it would work only with newer equipment as my can be old considering what is available today, Im using a 2004 panasonic 720p projector that I bought from Craigslist. This wire works great with no signal loss that I can notice. Like I said single was lost in my 1.3 standard wire but not in this 2.0 standard one. Another plus is the wire is flat which I really like as eventually the room will be painted and the wire can clone right into the wall looking very professional. I am happy to watch my home Cinema without any signal loss which made the video have interference like snow popping up on screen every now and then. That single loss was annoying and I was the only person that noticed it because I'm so finiky about my home theater. I honestly wish I can afford a newer projector with 3D and maybe even 4K but I got to live with the equipment I have as it is what I can afford. However I wanted any purchases for it to be future ready and buying this 2.0 standard 4k wire did it for me. Now I do not have to buy a new hdmi wire when I upgrade my projector.",

                "reviewText": "I have never been one to buy in to the concept of \"premium\" cables. Most cables are all the same inside and won't have any significant impact on performance that the average consumer can distinguish. With that being said, there are certain things to be aware of. I just upgraded our living room TV to a 70\" 4K display with HDR, but needed a cable that could do ARC without skipping.First, this cable is nice and flat. I needed a high speed cable that could handle 4k HDR content with ARC (audio return channel), that would also fit under a rug and not make a huge bump. This cable worked flawlessly. The cable I had been using was also rated as a High-Speed/4k HDMI cable, but the ARC audio was skipping and cutting out every few seconds. A quick google search will tell you this is a common problem. Many give up in frustration, but using ARC properly can be a great benefit.Quality:Though many will tell you all current cables are the same, there is definitely some variation when using an audio return function on your receiver. This cable seems very well made and was as described. It has solid, well made, connectors and seems to be on par with cables costing 3x as much. The flat design of this cable is perfect for running under a carpet or a floor rug.Delivery:As always, amazon delivered this cable quickly and with free shipping through Prime. Amazon has really taken the hassle out of ordering things like this that impatient folks like my self would normally run to Best Buy, Fry's, or other local stores to get quickly.",
