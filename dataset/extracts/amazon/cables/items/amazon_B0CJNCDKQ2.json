                "reviewText": "I bought this for my husband because he was always complaining that the cord he was charging with was too long and the cloth would fray. I decided to try this one out, because it's the perfect length for him to use at his computer desk. He has a gaming PC setup with the typical blue and red colors. This plugged into the PC and sits on his desk to charge his phone. He also uses it to transfer data from his phone to PC. The blue light compliments his setup and looks really cool and relaxing in the evening. 10/10 would buy another!",

                "reviewText": "PROs:- Slow pulsing effect is nice and serene, it wont make you feel like your about to go into an epileptic seizure like those annoying frantically flashing 'flow' cables.- I bought Red since any other color is likely too bright for a bedroom and would be just as annoying. The red has the perfect retina-relief brightness and is non-obtrusive.- Pulse effect stops and returns to constant on as soon as charging is complete (same as when its plugged in but nothing is connected), so its easy to tell from a distance when your phone is fully charged- Cable is very sturdy with tight and durable fittings (no mismatches or catchy edges)- No problems with data transferCONs?- Fiber optic is good though brightness noticeably ebbs towards the far end, yes just a fact of light transfer but would adding a second LED at the end improve this?- The cable itself is kind of hard-plasticy, almost 'springy', and is a bit wider than it probably needs to be, i prefer something a bit rubbery and rounderIn SUM:- This is still the best cable ive bought anywhere yet",

It is very durable much better than the light weight cords When plugged into the bigger adapter it charges much faster than the white cord.",
