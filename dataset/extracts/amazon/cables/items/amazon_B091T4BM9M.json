(The port's door had snapped off and the port itself cracked.) This cable fit snugly, although, as expected, it still needed to be taped. I also tied a line to the TV's mount to keep the cable end lifted in the right orientation. It works well, and is a less expensive and less of a hassle solution than the alternative of repairing the motherboard.",

I like that they have shipped the cables with a cover over the optical end, to protect them from dirt and dust during shipping. The jacket on the cables is definitely thicker than the old one that this is replacing, and it seems that it would protect the optical cable. Well. There's not a whole lot to say about optical cables, they worked just fine, were fairly inexpensive, and I am pleased with their operation.",

                "reviewText": "Two working optical cables and a free LED light to help plug the cable in correctly (handy if there is not a lot of light at the back of the PC etc.).If you are not experienced in using optical cables, do remember to remove the clear shipping protectors at *both* ends of the cable. The image shows the cable with one protector removed and (as a point of comparison) one not removed. Do not attempt to use this cable unless both protectors are removed -- the cable will not work and inserting the cables with the protectors in place will probably damage the equipment. Enough said.I have no idea why the complaints concerning the diameter of the cable and the claimed commensurate frailty, the cable only has to pass light, and snap in to the socket securely. It's plenty sturdy for the intended purpose. It's not intended to be used for water skiing, towing cars, or as an anchor line or mooring for a boat. It's not electrically conductive, it's purely optical, it doesn't need decorations such as gold plating or nylon braiding. This cable, with reasonable care, will likely outlast its owner.Ignore the haters, it's a good deal.",

Very thin, may not be as robust as some thicker cables - but excellent for installations where seldom moved around. Lightweight enough to place very little strain on sockets. Included in the package is an unexpected LED lamp, USB-a connector with a flexy, posable cable. (In a pack of 8, sells for 87-cents each.) It is rather high intensity, don't look directly into the light. Maybe it is included for testing the light transmission of fiber optic cables?",
