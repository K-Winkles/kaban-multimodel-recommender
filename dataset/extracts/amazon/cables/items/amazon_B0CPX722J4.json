                "reviewText": "I got this optical cable to connect audio from TV to a sound bar. Existing cable turned out to be stretched out with few changes that I made. This cable is of course longer (10ft) which gives good flexibility on arranging the placement properly. It doesn't get stretched and has no stress on TV or a soundbar connection sockets. Cable has a good protective outer layer which keeps inside safe from external factors. One of my other cable has a outer layer of rubber making it sticky to the touch, it's been in use from many years now. This cable has a better outer layer material which doesn't look like will turn out like that, hence it is seems to be string and durable. Connectivity wise, it worked well as soon as hooked up both the ends correctly. It is a very good quality optical cable for digital audio signal connectivity.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a longer optical audio cable to use with my speaker set, so I got this cable. It works well and I have had no problems with it! The build quality is good, and the cables otherwise seem nice enough. I enjoy the covers for the ends of the cables and the fact that the outside is the nicer fabric cover. In all I am pleased with these cables!",
