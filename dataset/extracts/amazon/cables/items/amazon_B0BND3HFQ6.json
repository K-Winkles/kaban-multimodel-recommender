                "reviewText": "Kxable fiber optic cables work great and sound amazing! I turned around and bought another pack! If you want the short answer, then 1) price is RIGHT, 2) the nice, thick flexible cable, and 3) the sound is excellent with bit-perfect transfer. Just buy it. If you want the long answer, ok messy desk I know, sorry! I am putting a whole house sound system together where I can control the music in every room separately or play the same music all together. I was going to use BlueOS but that was getting too expensive. I needed some other way to play my music I have on a hard drive as well as Amazon Music streaming, pandora, Spotify, and soon SiriusXM. I\u2019m using a Wiim Pro, but the sound was not great using the RCA output. Kxable to the rescue. The fiber optic output is just the digital signal so if I hooked that up to a cheap DAC how would it sound then? Amazing! But I need 6 rooms controlled and the cost is rising so I decided to give Kxable a try to save some money and hoped it would still sound great. It does, so back to sounding amazing. I just wished it had come in a pack of 6. Oh well, they got another order out of me. And for the cost I bought another 5-pack. So, well worth the extra dollar!",

                "reviewText": "These optical audio cables are surprisingly good at producing 5.1 surround sound and, best of all, they're very affordable. The cable itself is not thin but quite robust in my opinion. It's flexible throughout but not so much toward the connector ends. I mainly use it to connect my TV to the sound bar for enhanced audio experience. So far, I've not been disappointed. However, I do find the connectors are a bit tight fit, but not a great concern for me since I had more problem with loose connectors in the past. The only issue I have with these cables is that the protector end caps are not secured to the cable by any means during use. This means I will most likely lose them and can't reuse later should the cable going back for storage.",
