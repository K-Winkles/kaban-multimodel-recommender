                "reviewText": "Just needed an extra charging cable and given the price and number of cables (so that my family can use them too), gave these a shot--very happy with them. My understanding is that connecting a Mac device like an iPhone or iPad to a Mac for data transfer to a Mac computer can cause issues (which I've seen first hand many years ago), but simply using them to connect to a charging plug or portable charger is perfectly fine, thank goodness given the price of the Apple cable. So I just keep my official Apple cord always plugged into my Mac and use the chargers everywhere else in the house, car and on the road.",
