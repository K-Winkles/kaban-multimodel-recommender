Usually, with a quality connection, you kind of feel a little \"click\" when plugged in fully. This does not do that, and it hasn't worked for several of my devices that don't flat completely flat. So, it's not as versatile as Id love.This is a nice high quality cable, and it's long enough for some of the most hard to reach outlets. I like that it comes with an extra adapter. The chord is high quality and it charges my phone quickly. I like it!",

Much better than the 8\" cable that came with the drive!The braided cable seems like it will be very durable. It came with a nice velcro cable tie to keep the cable tidy when not in use.Additionally, it came with an adapter to make the cable usb-c to usb-c. I don't have a need for that at this point, but I imagine it will be handy in the future.As far as cables go, I like this one a lot!",
