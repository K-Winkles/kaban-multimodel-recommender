                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the [10ft 2-Pack] Long USB C to USB C Cable Fast Charging 60W, PD Type C Charger Cord Nylon from Amazon, and I must say that I am thoroughly impressed with its performance. These cables have quickly become an essential accessory in my daily routine.First, let's talk about charging speed. These cables are capable of delivering fast charging up to 60W, ensuring that my devices are powered up in no time. Whether I'm charging my Samsung Galaxy S23, S22, S21, S21+, S20 FE, Note 20 Ultra Plus, A80 5G, or my Pixel 7, 6 Pro, 6a, 5, 4, 3, 3a, 2 XL, these cables efficiently deliver the maximum charging power required. I no longer have to wait around for hours, thanks to the high-quality copper wire construction that ensures a stable and reliable charging experience.One aspect that sets these cables apart is their impressive build quality. The nylon braided material not only adds a stylish touch but also provides excellent durability. I've had my fair share of flimsy cables that break easily, but these cables have stood the test of time. The reinforced connectors and thick cables inspire confidence that they will last for a long time, even with daily use or frequent bending.Moreover, the generous length of 10 feet allows for hassle-free connectivity even when using my devices at a distance from the power source. It brings convenience to my workspace or when I'm lounging on the couch, eliminating the need to sit close to a power outlet. I appreciate the two-pack inclusion, as it provides a spare cable that I can keep in my bag or use in another room.In terms of compatibility, these cables have proved to be compatible with a wide range of devices. From my Samsung smartphones to my Google Pixel devices, these cables work flawlessly, providing the necessary charging power without any compatibility issues.Overall, I highly recommend the [10ft 2-Pack] Long USB C to USB C Cable Fast Charging 60W, PD Type C Charger Cord Nylon. The fast charging performance, durable construction, and generous length make these cables an excellent choice for anyone seeking a reliable charging solution. Say goodbye to slow charging and flimsy cables \u2013 these cables deliver exceptional performance and are definitely worth every penny.I am extremely satisfied with my purchase, and I will certainly consider purchasing more from this brand in the future.",

It's odd because it's the one that never leaves the spot that it's in that stopped working. The one that travels to and from work with me is still working just fine. Customer service reached out to me as soon as they found out I had a problem with one of their cords. I believe that one cord just had some sort of malfunction and it was not a normal happening. I will probably still purchase from them in the future due to the other cord working out so well.",
