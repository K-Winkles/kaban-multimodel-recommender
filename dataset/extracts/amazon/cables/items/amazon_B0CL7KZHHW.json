I requested a refund in April 2023 as the product was defective. Despite sending the item back with the proper labelling, we are now the end of June 2023 and I still have not received my refund. I can't resend the item back as I sent it back in April, and now I don't have the product or the refund. Terrible seller, quality of products, and service.",
