                "reviewText": "Review for \"5Pack (3/3/6/6/10FT) Fast Charging 3A USB-C to USB-A Cable Rapid Charger Quick Cord Comp...\"Not all USB cables are created equal, and it's easy to spend too much money on cables that look decent or make big claims that end up not working well or breaking. Especially in most stores. ESPECIALLY convenience stores. I see so many people spend upwards of $15 for a single cable that ends up being junk. I've done it myself. Live and learn. I work retail and worked many years in convenience stores, and I've sold many USB cables to unsuspecting victims, though I did try to warn people.For the price (or even a higher price), these cables work great and they last. And, if you've run into this issue before like I did, they both charge and transfer data. Before I bought these I was going through all of the various cheapie and free cables I'd gotten over the years so I could transfer data between my phone and computer, and only one of them transferred data. The rest would only charge. I didn't know that was a thing. I just thought a USB cable did what USB cables were supposed to do. So I'm pleased. I have multiples of several different lengths so I can keep cables in various places and not have to search for one, and they do what I've always thought USB cables are supposed to do. All for a crazy-good price. I'm set for now, but if I need to buy more, these are the ones I'm looking for. If you think you might need a USB cable soon, order these before you end up at a convenience store with a dead phone and have to spend way too much money on junk so you can get back in action again.",
