                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently purchased the Amazon Basics USB-A to USB-B 2.0 Cable and I couldn't be happier with my purchase! Not only was the price incredibly affordable, but the performance of this cable has exceeded my expectations.Right out of the box, the cable felt sturdy and well-made. The connectors fit snugly into my devices, providing a secure connection that I can rely on. I've used this cable to connect my printer to my computer, and the data transfer speeds have been consistently fast and reliable. No more waiting around for files to transfer \u2013 this cable gets the job done quickly.What truly sets this cable apart is its reliability. I've had experiences with other cables where they start to fray or show signs of wear after just a few uses. However, the Amazon Basics cable seems to be built to last. The durable construction gives me confidence that this cable will stand the test of time.In conclusion, I can't recommend the Amazon Basics USB-A to USB-B 2.0 Cable enough. It's affordable, well-made, and performs exceptionally well. If you're in need of a high-quality cable that won't break the bank, look no further.

                "reviewText": "Because of living on an island, and not having reliable WiFi, I needed a USB cable to my printer. However, none of the cables available locally were long enough for my desk setup. Therefore, for several years, I used an extender cable to attach to my USB printer cable. This more or less worked.....until it became balky; I would have to reinstall my printer every few days, because the computer couldn't find it. When I saw that one was available under the \"Amazon Basics\" brand, I was very happy. These are common, everyday products which are engineered very well, and typically cost a quarter, of so, what Apple and other folks charge.",
