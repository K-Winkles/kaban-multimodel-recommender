I have used this simultaneously with my phone, headphones and watch - then my phone, ipad and watch and so furth. I did not notice a lag while this was in use at all. The length between the three charger heads is not too short so you can charge the items with distance amongst each other. One of the lightning heads have a headphone icon on it so you can know which to use for your airpods. I have used this one on my ipad as well and have not noticed a lag while in use. So the icon may just be for cosmetic purposes not voltage. The entire cord is lengthy which is perfect for when you are not near an outlet or when you just need to lie down and do not want to risk bending the cord too far. This is beyond the worth of the price value and is definitely worth the steal.",
