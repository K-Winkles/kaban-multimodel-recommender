                "reviewText": "My wife and I have a large garden and raise chickens for eggs. We use numerous zip ties to hold temporary fencing together when we close our garden down for the year. The fencing is from the coop area to the individual raised garden beds (6 30'x4' concrete block beds) where the chickens scratch and peck all the weeds and old garden plants out of the ground for us. Okay, not all of them. We pull the largest things, like our Russian Sunflowers (2+ inch stalks that are as hard as a tree trunk. Small trunk, yes) and our tomato, cucumber, and squash plants. They are too much for a chicken to deal with. But, they get rid of the grasses and weeds, which are then easy enough to rake up and put in the compost or fire bins.Okay, that's more information than needed.We use these longer zip ties to connect large trellises to T-Posts to hold them up when the squash/melons get too heavy for the trellises to be stable. Last summer we had 6 large squash on one side of a trellis, and it started to fall over. I used 3 zip ties together to reach a large rebar I pounded into the ground. It worked very well. But, I only have a few of that size of zip ties left. These will be nice to have next summer.",
