When I opened the package and pulled one out, I connected it and tried to pull it apart. I was surprised when it broke (I\u2019m not that strong\u2026). The listing claims 40lb tensile strength so I decided to do a simple test. I hung a 25lb bag of flour from a screw and put the zip tie to work. To be honest, I expected the tie to break, but I\u2019m happy to report it handled the 25lb weight well (photos). I would not classify these zip ties as \u201cheavy duty\u201d as the listing claims. Still, for regular or light-duty use, they are a great value.",

I always try to get UV resistant ties because they are rated for outdoor use and tend to last longer than non-UV cable ties. I use a lot of zip ties and a pack of 1000 is very helpful and cost effective.",

He currently is using several to hold up and organize wiring on his side-by-side, and also to organize electrical cords in his garage. With this amount, he says he'll most likely never run out of them, and when in the middle of a project, that certainly offers peace of mind!",
