                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I've had my own shares of many charging cables but this is one of my favorite charging cables because :1) It supports up to 100W super fast charging2) It's made out of nylon braided cable, which is not only durable but also more flexible3) It has LED display on one side, which shows the total wattage being consumed by the deviceI didn't think the display of the wattage was that important until I realized the different devices have different max capacity on how much watts it can consume to power or for charging the battery. Sometimes, I had a device plugged into a charging cable for days, only to find out that it didn't get charged when I unplugged the cable. The LED display on this cable takes the guessing game out of the equation and I know whether it's being charged and exactly how much watts are being consumed at the moment. This also allows me to know which devices support fast charging or not.I did some preliminary testing with an advanced power station that shows the total wattage output when being used so i can compare with the wattage number displayed on the cable and it's pretty dead accurate. When the wattage currency changes, there's about half second delay in updating the display but it always matched the wattage output displayed on the power station within a second. I was able to confirm that it can also support up to 100W fast charging, which is pretty amazing. Very practical and useful USB-C charging cable and I also love the braided cable material. Highly recommend it.",

When I went to unplug my headset this morning, I was alarmed by how hot the cable end was. While trying to unplug, the metal part pulled away from the plastic, it was literally melting. After unplugging the cable from both the charger and my headset, I noticed both ends were hot, grabbed my contactless thermometer (and of course had to change the batteries) and the device end registered 127\u00baF, the other end 105\u00baF. I have no idea what temperature it actually reached.I was beyond the return policy and with seemingly no option to contact the seller, I reached out to Amazon and was refunded for my purchase.",
