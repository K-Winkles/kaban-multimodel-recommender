I plugged in my iPhone 13 Pro the other day when it was at 4% battery and walked away for like 2 minutes and it was already at 14%. I can even use my phone while it is charging and it doesn\u2019t slow the charging process. The price is so amazing. I will probably buy a million of these. I\u2019ve used these for several months now, and there are zero signs of fraying or damage. I have one in my car, my living room, and my bedroom. If I lose one, I won\u2019t fret because the price is so amazing. I highly recommend these!!",
