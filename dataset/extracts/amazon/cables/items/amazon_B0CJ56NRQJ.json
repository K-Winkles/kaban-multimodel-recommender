                "reviewText": "The fastest connector on my under-desk PC\u2019s motherboard is a USB 3.1 Gen2 Type-C port on the back. Crawling under my desk to use it is inconvenient, to say the least. So this 'USB C Extension Cable 3.3FT USB C Extender' is just the ticket, to bring that Type-C port up to my desktop for easy access.This cable looks robust and well made. The thick nylon-braided sheathing and strain-relief at the connectors looks well up to any abuse I am likely to subject it to. While the sheathing is rugged, it is also a bit stiff, so it will be limited in how tightly you can bundle any excess length. Not a problem in my case, just something to be aware of.My only concern with this cable is that there are no informational markings on the cable or connectors (or even the packaging). If this was a USB-IF Certified cable, the data-transfer speed and maximum charging wattage would be clearly marked on the connectors. Because it is not Certified, I have only the product description to rely on. I do not have the capability of testing the claimed specs (100W/10Gbps USB 3.1 Gen2) on my own.IF the specs are as claimed, this extension cable should fulfill any needs I have, even way down the road. But if the cable gets mixed in with other cables, I will have no way to know what its capabilities are, since there are no icons or markings on it.ASSUMING the specs are actually as claimed, this is a nice cable. But I have lowered my rating by one star for the inconvenience (and uncertainty) of it being unmarked.",

I use it for flash drives and a USB C portable hard drive. I see no difference in the speed copying files to and from these devices with this cable attached. Plugs fit nicely and cable is covered with a braided material that looks like it will add to the longevity of this.",

                "reviewText": "Most days I don't use my USB C port but when I do im plugging something into there multiple times or scraping the side of my laptop trying to get the cable inserted. By using this, I plug this in once and everything else plugs into the other end of the cable. Here are my four points - 1. Made of quality material, the braid and ends look and feel solid. 2. Long enough to leave plugged in but not stretch over my entire desk. 3. If you're using it as an extension cable it's easy to tuck away or hide behind monitors. 4. For the quality it's at a good price point.",
