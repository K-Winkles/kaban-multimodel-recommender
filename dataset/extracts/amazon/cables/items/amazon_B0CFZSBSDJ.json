                "reviewText": "I\u2019m impressed with these braided cables so far. They are solidly made, sturdy, and look good with in the car, office, and home. They have been stepped on several times while lying on the ground and sat on in the car with no apparent damage.And I love the length. It comes in handy when someone sitting in the back seat or across the table needs to borrow a charge, or when the nearest outlet is several feet away.",
