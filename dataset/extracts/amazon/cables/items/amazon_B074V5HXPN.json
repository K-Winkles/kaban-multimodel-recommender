I was told to wipe it clean on a pc and it should fix it. It did not the last things I read was to switch the connection cable from 3.1 to 3.0 due to the PS5 not recognizing the newer tech. I plugged it in and immediately it formatted my external and was able to be used and install games. So glad it worked and the quality of the cable is top notch. Highly recommended if You are having that glitch.",
