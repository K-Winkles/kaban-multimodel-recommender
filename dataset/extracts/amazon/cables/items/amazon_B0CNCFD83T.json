Long enough to have my phone on my dash when needed (GPS, time-lapse video, etc.) I haven't noticed any issues with audio, seems perfectly fine to me. Clear, no static, fuzz/noise, & picks up on all levels; bass, pitches, etc. Great buy!",

It does not introduce any significant/noticeable disruptions. It is a bit stiff, which is an advantage for this type of use. However, as a headphone extension cable, it will probably be inconvenient for this reason. I have not checked the frequency response of this cable, but I am satisfied. I think this is one of the better cables for such applications on Amazon.",
