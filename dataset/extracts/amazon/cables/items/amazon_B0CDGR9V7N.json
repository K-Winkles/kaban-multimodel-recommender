                "reviewText": "I got these cords as a longer, but still pocketable lead for my KA13 DAC, and to a lesser extent use on my portable SSDs with USB-C interface. They work fine for charging and data, but do limit transfer speeds on fast SSDs to USB 2.0 max speeds. This is fine for most small daily tasks or using them on older consoles and stuff. Works fine with my DAC as the throughput on my phone doesn't max out the cables capability",

The 90 degree bend at the USB C is great as it decreases any stress on the cord and fitting on the phone and the short length is perfect as the USB port is very close to the phone so any extra length is totally unnecessary.The price is excellent as well.",
