                "reviewText": "I got this to try and simplify my life a little. I have both USB type A adapters, USB Type C adapters, and adapters that have Both Type A and Type C USB ports. I was getting tired of keeping track and storing all these adapters. So, I decided it would be easer to go with straight C as much as possible. It\u2019s newer technology and most things are going that way anyway. I could have used a cheap adapter that would change it from Type A to Type C, but I am leery of using adapters of any kind. If the cable starts having issues, it\u2019s one more thing I must troubleshoot when figuring out what the issue is. If there is no adapter, and the cable starts having issues, it\u2019s most likely the cable, and I can just swap cables to test it out. Again, trying to simplify my life. One of the challenges of using third party cables is getting one that is also MFi certified. This is important for two reasons. The first and probably most important is that non-MFi cables can run hot and potentially overheat the device, which can cause damage. Second MFi devices support data transfer. When I want to connect my phone to a computer, I do not want to have to remember which cable works for data transfer and which one does not. Once again, simplicity. This cable supports data transfer and doesn\u2019t overheat my device. The cables look to be of good quality, so I think they will last for a while. Overall, I like these cables.",

I would not expect them to last a long time under heavy usage,However, they do work and charge my kids devices. The kids loose these cables at an astonishing rate, so having a decent set of cables for an affordable price is a good thing.I would absolutely recommend these if you have a family full of forgetful squirrels.Would buy again.",

Though I wish someone could crack the code and make a cable that last forever. I tested these for power output before handing them off to my kids and they indeed charge at the rated 20w. Over all there are a good value. And I'll buy them again.",

To erase / reset it, I needed to connect it to my laptop; and that required this type of cable.As you can see from pic, you get three cables nicely packaged in a ziplock pouch. They have the same feel as any other Apple cable but I've read about how non-original cables can have issues re: transfer of data. Fortunately, I did not encounter any such issue here. I followed Apple's directions on how to reset the phone and everything worked just as it was supposed to. Once finished, the phone's screen indicated that it was also charging through the cable ( as expected ).I got this product specifically for this purpose. And it worked just fine.Very pleased.",
