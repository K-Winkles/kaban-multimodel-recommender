I decided to try to put another monitor at the back of the store where we do internet fulfillment.With just enough information to be dangerous, after evaluation, I bought three things: This VGA Splitter, a 50' VGA male to male cord and a used monitor from our local Goodwill (test it first, they are non-refunable there). Long store short, I was able to set up a second security monitor in that second main area of our back room for just around $40. Helpful!We do have a doorbell that chimes in the back if we're not on the floor, but it's nice to see the approach.",
