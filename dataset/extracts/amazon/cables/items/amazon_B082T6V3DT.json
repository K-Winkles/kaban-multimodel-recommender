I primarily use it to charge my iPhone 13 Pro Max and my company-issued iPhone X.One of the standout features of this cable is its build quality. The connectors and wires feel sturdy and well-made, eliminating that cheap and flimsy sensation often associated with other charging cables. The nylon braided cord adds an extra layer of durability, making it resistant to wear and tear.I primarily use this cable in my office, where it has become an essential part of my setup. The 6-foot length provides ample reach, allowing me to comfortably use my devices while they charge. The rose gold color adds a touch of elegance, making it visually appealing as well.The connection performance is excellent, and I've experienced no issues with the cable. It connects seamlessly to my Apple devices, and the charging speed is on par with Apple's original cables. I appreciate the MFi certification, ensuring compatibility and reliability with Apple products.One of the most impressive aspects is that after several months of regular use, I have encountered no problems with the cable. It has proven to be a durable and long-lasting solution for my charging needs.",

They\u2019re double the length (the charger included with an iPhone is 3ft), it includes two, they\u2019re braided for better durability, and there are 2 of them!! For reference, an apple charger that is 3ft not braided is $20 (the same price for this pack). These will last you so so so long. They\u2019re also from a reputable company (amazon), so you\u2019ll get great support and help you may need. I used to have this 5 pack of chargers for 8 bucks. Yes it seemed like a great deal, but the quality was horrible. They stopped after a week. 4 of them did. I didn\u2019t use the 5th one because I knew how it would go. Just spend a bit more money and get this. It\u2019ll last you years if you treat it right.",
