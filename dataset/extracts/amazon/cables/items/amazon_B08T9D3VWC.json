I have a LOT of rechargeable things around the house with every connector known to man, so having all 3 in one cable is a huge solution for keeping things uncluttered. I'm able to charge my iphone and usb c earbuds at the same time on one cable. At work, people are always stealing cables and bringing in new ones, so I bought a pair of these just for work too and put a cable tie on it so it can't walk away. Now no matter who is there they have the cable they need and they'll have to work harder to take off with it. At work I'm able to charge my headphones (usb micro) and iphone at the same time. I also charge the work phone usb c regularly without having to switch anything out. If you need 3 cables all the time like me, buy this, it's a game changer.",
