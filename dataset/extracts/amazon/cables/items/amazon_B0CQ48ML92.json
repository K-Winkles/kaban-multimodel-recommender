                "reviewText": "I was losing my HDMI eARC sound on occasion. I knew I was using an older cable, so I purchased a Highwings 3.3ft 8K High Speed Braided HDMI 2.1 cable to upgrade to the latest standard. I also purchased two of the Certified 6.6ft cables for connections to my 4K UHD TV (Roku ULTRA LT and a Blu Ray player). I was expecting (hoping) to get better and more consistent sound on my sound bar. It works, and sounds fine. I personally don't notice much difference, but I hope it will be more consistent. I was AMAZED in the improved picture quality of my streaming services. EVERYTHING is so much clearer. Colors are more vibrant. I am now seeing the 4K UHD difference I did NOT see when I upgraded to this 4K TV. SO GLAD I upgraded to these cables. I should have done this when I upgraded my TV!!!!",
