                "reviewText": "Anker are one of my go to brands for charging accessories. I have an Anker 3 in 1 Cube and 67w GAN wall charger which are both superb. Unfortunately the cables are not of the same quality. The connectors are fine but the cable is way too stiff which makes it awkward to pack for travel. It never lays flat and has far to many kinks. Due to the stiffness of the cable I cannot see the cable lasting too long so I have had to return for a refund. I have Nomad cables which are far superior so I will stick with using them for now and in the future.",
