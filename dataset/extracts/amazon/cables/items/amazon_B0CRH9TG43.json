                "reviewText": "As far as I can tell, these three 10-foot cables are identical to the one that came with my Wyze Pan Cam V3 camera, except for their being three feet longer. That may not seem like much, but it makes all the difference in my living room, where the only places I can plug in a USB cable are tucked away and low to the ground. The extra yard lets me park the camera on the mantel in the middle of the room, where I can find the cats wherever they are in the living room and on into the kitchen. Maybe not a problem if you live in a modern house or apartment with outlets everywhere. For me, though, the extra yard means I can cover a large area with a single camera, freeing a couple of others for the rest of the house. So these are just what I needed.",
