                "reviewText": "The Kxable mic cable is pretty good. The cable stock looks to be of good design. Double shielded, copper over foil, with additional strengthening fibers inside. The soldering skill is decent, with no cold or dirty joints. The cable assembler tied the XLR Shell to Pin1, which is generally a no-no for analog audio. XLR shells should almost always be floating relative to the cable, so that they may ground to the chassis at the device. In a \"properly\" designed device, either Pin1 and the shell will tie to chassis at the same point local to the connector, or the shell directly to chassis at the connector and Pin1 to a low-impedance bus bar and then to chassis. Unfortunately, many improperly designed devices will tie Pin1 to the circuit ground on the PCB, which then ties to chassis far away, often near the power input, injecting shield noise across the PCB. Having Pin1 tied to shell in a cable plugged into a device like that now means that there are multiple paths from circuit ground to chassis ground. The main time I can think where you might want shells terminated inside the cable is for digital cables that are intended to be daisy-chained. In that scenario, it creates a continuous shield around the \"splice\". You'll still need to be sure that the devices on both ends terminate Pin1 directly to the chassis as close to the connector as possible. It would be easy enough to just snip the connection inside the XLR connector, except on one of the connectors the assembler brought the shield conductor to the shell tab first, then to Pin1, so snipping it would lift Pin1 on that end, which depending on specific application you might want or not. Not a big deal, there's plenty of conductor length to desolder it from the tab and move it over.",

                "reviewText": "I needed some XLR cables to connect my subs and pole mounted main speakers. In most applications, 6 foot cables are about 9 inches too short. I would have preferred 7' cables, I don't like extra cable mess, but these are an acceptable compromise. Very well constructed, close to Mogami silver in quality. They will get a lot of use.",
