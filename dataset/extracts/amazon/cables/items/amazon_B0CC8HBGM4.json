                "reviewText": "I used this wire to run power from my car's battery to a ham radio in my trunk, and an inverter under my driver seat. This wire fit the bill perfectly. It is water, oil resistant, and tinned (to resist corrosion). One challenge I ran into was its stiffness. Despite having many fine strands, the wire doesn't flex well. You can bend it, but wants to spring back and doesn't hold its shape. This made running the wire under the hood through the firewall, and along the door moulding... a LOT of work. I scraped a lot of knuckle in the process. Overall, I'd still recommend using it for automotive projects. It is a high quality wire. Just know that it's hard to manipulate though a lot of twists and turns.",
