I didn't want to spend a fortune on it, but at the same time I wanted a guarantee that it will work. This Belkin cable was the solution, optimal performance and a reasonable price. Definitely recommended.",

Compared to the 1-meter USB-C cable that came with the monitor, this Belkin cable is thinner, lighter, and more flexible. And twice as long, of course. The cable sheath has a matte finish with a soft feel. It\u2019s a nice cable! Works as expected for 4K60 video + USB data.The plugs do feel a little less solidly snug than other USB-C cables I own \u2014 they have just a bit of wiggle if you try to shift them around when plugged in, but they don\u2019t slip out. I can see this worrying someone who has to move things around a lot, but it isn\u2019t a problem for my system that stays on my work desk.",

                "reviewText": "This cable is actually a lot thicker than the usual type c cable but I assume this is because of the thunderbolt capability. Unlike many other cables, this is not made of nylon fiber which actually made it get frayed and damaged a bit easier. You do get a longer length so you can be sure that the cable will provide you a good amount of slack. I could actually go a bit further with my laptop. I do not have to be right next to the external GPU which is great. It works pretty well with my external GPU and laptop. The cable has a pretty reliable feel and connections. This cable works well with thunderbolt port. You can plug it into a thunderbolt device or any type c port. Another thing about the cable is able to sync and charge my device without issues. It has no connection issues which is great for this laptop. Even if you happen to tap the cable a little bit, it does not lose connection. It does take a bit of force to plug the cable into the laptop and device the first few times. For charging, be aware that the actual charging capacity of the cables are dependent more on what outlet you are using. If you are using a fast charging port or a wall outlet you will actually get a faster charge then you would from a laptop USB. When plugged directly into my mac, it actually charges pretty quickly but again depends on the outlet you are using. The cable do not have any issues with heating or connection. The cable itself is longer than standard three feet. In terms of durability, it does you do have to worry about the cable getting frayed or anything. The cable is SUPER thick but pretty easy to consolidate. There is no tie which is a bit of a bummer. A nice thing about the material color is that you cannot see it get visibly dirt which is great. The color of the cable has yet to fade from overall use. The cable is able to transfer about the same speed as a traditional type c to type c cable or at thunderbolt speeds. This did work as a charging cable for my mac but only when I needed it to be. I would not actually recommend using this for that purpose unless it is your only option. Overall I think this cable is pretty nice. It is longer than your traditional cable but not by much. It is a thicker but definitely not the most durable cable. It actually frayed a little bit which is annoying.",

It gets the job done providing me with a reliable Thunderbolt connection between my Mac-mini and my 4K Dell monitor. My only issue with this cable is that it's very expensive for what it is. However if you want a reliable connection with your equipment I guess you have to pay the price.",
