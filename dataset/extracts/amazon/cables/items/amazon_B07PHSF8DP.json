So far so good, why wouldn't be any trouble? well, in the past I bought something like this, but when I accidentally yank it, it broke, the wire too weak at the plug, not the phone terminal though, it just come right off luckily. But these seems to be sturdy, durable, and not that stiff. Will it last few months? probably, few years? I think not.The reason I bought these is because my iphone have a phone case, and I have few phone cases, and none of them would charge wirelessly on a wireless charging pad. I don't like to take my phone out of the case and have it charge wirelessly every time. Why can't there be a charging pad wirelessly that can charge a phone even if it have a thick case, hopefully soon, but for now, I use the cable otherwise my iphone naked without the case dropping it would be a disaster.",

                "reviewText": "I get scared buying chargers on Amazon because I have bought so many in the past that last a month at most. This brand is different. I have been using my charger for probably about a year now and I still have extras. It\u2019s a plus that they are long. I\u2019ve never had any problems with them. The only \u201cdownside\u201d is that they may struggle to charge well if you bend the cord too much close to where you charge it. Of course that goes without saying and Apple chargers are nothing compared to these.",
