                "reviewText": "1. I couldn't find in the description how many of each size are included in the assortment of 1000.I received my shipment today and there are 200 of each size.Some sellers include a greater number of less costly small sizes with assortments.2. I selected this vendor because they provided more specifications than others. Mainly, I was interested in the shortest length being thin so they wouldn't be very visible. I was restringing a set of white wire Christmas lights on a white outdoor decorationThis seller provided the width of each length zip tie while the \"Amazon's Choice\" seller did not specifically mention the width of each different length. Their only width listed appeared that all their 1000 assortment had the same width which matched the width of the longest tie. If accurate, that would make the smallest tie more visible than I preferred.3. One thing that surprised me was the width of the larger lengths which was narrower than what I expected. (Since I was mainly interested in the shortest length, I did not compare the widths of the longer lengths between sellers). After arrival, I compared to \"Amazon's Choice\" and the widths were the same.I also compared to a black assortment I purchased 5 years ago from Amazon. That manufacturer is no longer listed on Amazon or a Google search. While the longer ties are only 3 mm wide with this purchase, ties I ordered 5 years ago are 4.8 mm wide. This wider width seems more appropriate for the strength probably needed when using long ties.",
