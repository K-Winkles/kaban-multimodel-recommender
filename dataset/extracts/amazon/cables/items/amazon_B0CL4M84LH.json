                "reviewText": "I got these cables to replace some standard ones that have frayed overtime. I\u2019m a chef and I keep my cords in my day bag and in my kitchen. They get thrown around and are subjected to a lot of abuse from travel and being tossed around/cleared off the prep table when we\u2019re getting ready for service. I\u2019ve put my cords through quite a bit and these in particular have held up better than any that I have used. Very robust construction, very attractive and very unique so that you\u2019re not getting yours confused with others. Priced very fair and would make a great gift for anyone who\u2019s always losing or breaking their cables.",

                "reviewText": "Seen marked down due to overstock, at 3 for $5 wasn't really expecting that much just your basic cheap cables that will work fine but aren't very sturdy/durable. Time will tell as I've just received them but they seem much more durable than the average charging cord especially at this price. I've seen single cables for $15 that aren't this well built. Will update if they end up not lasting as long as I think they will but so far they've pretty much been the best deal I've ever seen for charging cable.",
