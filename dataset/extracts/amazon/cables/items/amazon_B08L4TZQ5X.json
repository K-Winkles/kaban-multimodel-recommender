Your style, Your choice.",
            "(Amplify the Sound, And Your Talent) Guitar, bass, or keyboard, whatever your musical kink is, as long as they feature a 6.35mm jack, you can use this cable to connect them to an external amplifier whenever you feel philharmonic and want to let the world hear you roar.",

                "reviewText": "Okay, they work fine, and the cost is great, but I don't like them personally.Overall, the chords are fine. They work, they haven't broken, and they are cheap. For a high school band that doesn't have any money, BUY THESE!! They do the work, there's NOTHING wrong with them, and it is one of the best deals for the money you're spending. However, there are some things to consider for those with the money to choose.1. They are cheap. It is a plastic casing around the jack, and they are thin and overall feel cheap.2. Because they are thin, they tangle easily. Just a pet peeve of mine, but a big enough one that I don't take these places or use them for guitar--> amp. For amp to amp or pedals to amp, it's fine, I route them, and they stay, but in any situation where they move, they're annoying.Again, they aren't bad! Especially for the price, but there are just a few things that would make me choose different cables instead.",
