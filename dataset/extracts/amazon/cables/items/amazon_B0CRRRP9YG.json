                "reviewText": "I have to say this cable may be the best USB-C to USB-C cable I own. This cable is very thick, which is a combination of the internal electrical transmission components and the cable sheathing. The thickness contributes substantially to the durability, as does the very stiff and solid cable end housing that protects the USB-C tip. At one-foot, it's not a long cable, and it was not intended to be. I could not verify 8K throughput as I do not have the proper equipment to test that claim. 4K video played perfectly without artifacts, jitter or latency. Data throughput was also excellent at speeds around 5Gbps, which is the limit of my equipment. I would not at all be surprised if this cable would reach 80%-90% of the throughput claims with proper equipment at both ends, which would be at the high end of what can reasonably be expect from any cable at any price. I used it to charge my iPhone 15 Pro Max brom a 60W charging source, and it charged the phone super fast - I don't know how fast, but certainly faster than any other cable I own. The price is a little high if it were a run-of-the-mill cable, but given the quality of this cable, it's at good price. Don't hesitate to buy this cable if your use case calls for a cable with high throughout, minimal data loss, minimal latency, high durability and short cable length.",

                "reviewText": "I have a couple of \"10GBps\" NVMe enclosures that came with USB-C to USB-C connector cables. Presumably the cables should have a pretty good throughput. I replaced one of those cables with this one and measured sequential read speeds with this cable and with the original cable. Both came in right at 700 MBps (=5.6GBps). The NVMe ssd in the enclosure is only a PCIe Gen 3x4 (not the latest technology) so I am presuming both cables maxed out at the maximum throughput that the ssd could supply.So my conclusion is that this cable might well be capable of 10GBps and I know it is capable of 5.6, which is pretty darn fast. The cable didn't even get warm at 5.6.So four stars for doing as good of a job as I can make use of.",

                "reviewText": "Of the millions of USB-C cables out there, most people don't realize there's a big difference between cables. A lot of the free/cheap USB-C cables are only support charging/power, and don't support high speed data(or data at all). This cable does both power and high speed data and video. This is essential if you need to connect a USB-C external hard drive, video camera, or monitor to your computer. I don't have any devices that transfer at 20GBs or a 8k monitor to test this cable with, but I do have a couple of 10Gbps external SSD drives that I was able to try this Kakapozo branded USB-C Cable with. My 2023 MacBook Pro recognized the SSD right away through this cable and the system report confirmed that my MacBook was able to talk to my SSD at its 10Gbps transfer rate. Long review aside, this cable basically works as described, is good quality and comes with durable aluminum connector ends.",

                "reviewText": "It took a long time to receive (not sure who/what caused the delay), but was worth the wait!I recently upgraded my external display to a 4K model that includes USB-C. Several cables I already had caused blurriness or flickering when connected to my MacBook USB-C port. This cable works perfectly for the video signal and charging.The value is off the chart! It has a feeling of quality with a nice braided covering, and as mentioned before, great performance. It is less than half the price of others that show high-speed video capability. The 10 foot cable length gave me more flexibility in routing the wire to be most hidden.I'm sure this would work great for high-speed data transfer as well, but that's not my primary use case.I honestly don't have a bad thing to say about it. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This is the best USB-C cable I have. It looks and feels very high quality.I used my SSD external USB drive to test its speed. When I copied a big 40GB file from my PC to external USB using this cable, it reaches the speed that is slightly higher than when I used the data cable that comes with USB drive. The speed is between 330 to 340 MB/s which is 2.62 to 2.72 Gbps if I calculated it correctly.I don't have a PC and a device that support USB-C 3.1 Gen2 to test its top speed. I am sure it can reach higher speed.If I ever need another USB cable, I will get it from KAKAPOZO",

It's several feet long, which I'm sure is very versatile, BUT it's a bit cumbersome for my charging setup.This 1 foot-long cable is very practical. The cable itself feels heavier than usual. It has a braided covering and strain-relief on both ends. The protective caps on both ends is a nice touch.I don't know that I'll ever make use of all of the capabilities described in the writeup, but as a charging cable, it's great!",
