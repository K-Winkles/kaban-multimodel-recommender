I love that you get three of them. I have one in each room in my house at all times. 100% recommend these!",

Waste of my time.Revised review: This appears to be a USB 2.0 cable and high speed data transfer will need a 3.1 cable. Probably my bad not knowing that before ordering. Have to assume cables would work for 2.0. So give them 4 stars ... they were attractive.",
