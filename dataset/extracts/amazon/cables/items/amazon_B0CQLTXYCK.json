It definitely outlasted other \"value\" or \"good deal\" cables purchased elsewhere, that being said one went out after close to 5 months of using nightly to charge my phone. It stayed plugged in my bedroom, no moving it around all the time. So bottom line, i was impressed that this one lasted THAT long.Loved the length of it! Good value even at 5 months use just seems such a shame that cables are practically disposable in this day and age",
