I know people say that it is because they are longer but i have other long cables that will do the 30 minute hypercharge that my phone does but these cables take 3x as long to charge. It isn't about length, a 6 foot cable is not long. I threw away the package so i can't even return them. They are just useless to me because of how painfully slow they charge so they will also go i to the trash and maybe someday i'll learn to save the package a little longer.",

This product has excellent build quality and workmanship, the company really stands behind their product, the price is very reasonable and a true bargain for what you get. They have an excellent warranty. And it functions flawlessly.I have been using these cords for two main purposes:1. As the main charger for USB-C phones in my home (Asus Zenfone and Motorola Edge+). Both these phones have very large batteries and this cord delivers power to them at the maximum expected rate, allowing them to charge very fast. I did add a setting into my phone to let is charge slowly (Asus \"stradycharge\" function) to reduce wear on the battery, and the cord has been able to support that function as well. Overall, I am entirely pleased with the charging ability of these cords. They don't get hot and are nice and sturdy, so I can place them into any position I like.2. To connect an external HDD to my 4K TV to play back movies and shows. Thus, using the cord to pass through huge files with HDR 4K signal with high-quality audio. For this purpose as well, the cord functions flawlessly. The video and audio passes through smoothly for hours at a time without any degradation in playback quality whatsoever and no heat buildup. Again, a testament to the quality of this product. Best of all, because it's a nice long cord, I am able to hide my HDD deep in the TV stand preventing wire clutter.Overall, it's an excellent product that I would entirely recommend without question.",

The reinforced joints at the connector ends add a nice touch to the look but certainly should help toughen the area to prevent internal breaks. I plugged in my Pixel 3A XL and as expected, got the \"charging rapidly message\", so I know the wire gauge inside this cable is larger and rated for higher current charging. I got a pack of 2 and at 6.6 feet each for over 13 feet of wire with beautiful ends the price point provides great value for money. Quite happy with my purchase and would do it again if the need arises.",

What's even better is that it's three times cheaper and it comes with two cables. While it does feel somewhat flimsy to the touch, it has been working flawlessly thus far. As a college student, I've been putting this cable THROUGH IT, and so far, it held up remarkably well!",
