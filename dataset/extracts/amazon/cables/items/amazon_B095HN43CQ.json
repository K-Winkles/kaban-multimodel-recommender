You can log in to the official Apple MFi Accessories and search our brand \"TUMABER\" to confirm. Q2: Why does the phone get hot when it's charging? A: This is normal, because the phone will generate some heat when it is charging. However, the main reasons for the heat are as follows: 1. The charging speed will be faster when the phone power is low, the wall charger will output 9V high voltage, and the phone will generate heat because of the voltage converting process. 2. There are too many programs running in the background of the phone, causing the phone to run at a high load and generate more heat. Recommendations: 1. Clean up the running program of the phone with high power consumption in the background in time. 2. Don't play the phone while the phone is charged with low power, otherwise the phone will be in a high load state. About the error message \"This accessory may not be supported by device\": The message would appear if you were using a non-Apple wall charger or in poor transmission, but even if you are using an Apple accessory, the error can also happen for the firmware problem with iOS.",

Here's a breakdown of why they've become a staple in my tech arsenal:1. **Apple MFi Certified**: Knowing these cables are MFi certified gives me peace of mind. It means they're made to Apple's strict quality standards, ensuring a safe and efficient charge every time.2. **Extended Length**: The 6ft length is a game-changer. It offers that extra reach, whether I'm using my device on the couch, bed, or at a desk. No more being tethered too close to the power outlet.3. **Fast Charging**: With a 2.4A charging capability, my devices power up quickly. It's especially noticeable when I'm in a hurry and need a quick battery boost.4. **Durable Design**: These cables feel sturdy and well-made. They're not flimsy, and I've noticed they resist tangling, which is a huge plus for someone who often just tosses cables into a bag.5. **Value Pack**: Getting three cables in one pack is great value for money. I now have one for home, one for the office, and an extra for my travel bag.6. **Wide Compatibility**: These cables are compatible with a range of Apple devices, from the iPhone 13 all the way down to the iPhone 6. It's great knowing I can use them across multiple devices without any issues.In conclusion, this 3-pack of 6ft Apple MFi Certified Charger Cables is a solid investment for any Apple device owner. They're reliable, durable, and offer the convenience of fast charging and extended reach. Easily a 5-star product in my book! \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50",

They always come in handy.I keep some at home and travel with others. I'm pretty tough on these and I also lose charging cords from time to time as I travel a LOT.I keep coming back to these because they're the perfect price. I like the longer length for travelling because not every hotel has an outlet right next to the bed.I'm tough on my electronics- so I have worn a few of these out- which is where the 3 pack comes in handy. I'd say that these will last as long as any other standard charging cord I've owned. I should note that I use my phone when it's charging which likely adds to wear and tear.These get the job done!",
