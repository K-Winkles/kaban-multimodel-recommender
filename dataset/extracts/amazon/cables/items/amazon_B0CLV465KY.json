However it does have many other useful applications for this class of USB connectivity.This might not be very useful information as such. Maybe it is though. The most important thing to keep in mind from this though however, is that it will not work to connect your phone via cable to an older vehicle's Bluetooth to glove box stored adapter.If you have such a set up, then you probably understand what I 'm saying here.",

When I use my other charger on the wall plug, it actually works pretty good compared to this one so I know it\u2019s not the wall outlet. I do like the length of it so I will continue to use it.",
