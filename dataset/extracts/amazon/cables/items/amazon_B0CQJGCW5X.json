I am as forgetful as anything and will pick up my phone still hooked to the cable and walk off. Or get out of my truck with the stupid thing still plugged in. Native Union works for me. The cable is tough, yet still pliable to be functional. I have bought a few in the past that were so thick they didn't bend as you use the product. I have the belted Lightnening Cable and have used it for over a year without an issue. I just bought the belted C and it's quality matches the Lightening cable. I also have their multi, function Ligntening, Micro USB, USB C and it's long, but the trade off is good having all three in one cable.",
