These impressed me though. I opted for some colored ones as I already have plenty of black and white/clear ones. The have a good width and thickness and are moderate in the strength department. I could pull and actually break them and they would actually fail the main part of the tie and not the locking mechanism. I don't typically use zip ties for strength so this isn't important to me, but I would say they are average or slightly above average compared to others I have. I included some other dimensions for reference.In short, get them. They are a great buy!************************************************My Rating Scale:5 STARS - Item worked better than advertised and exceeded my expectations. The item provided more value than I anticipated and is a great deal. The item seems very well made and should last for a long time. (HIGHLY recommend)4 STARS - Item worked exactly as expected if not slightly better. Item appears to be made well. I have no major complaints, it just didn't exceed my expectations (Good value, well made, met expectations, would recommend)3 STARS - Item worked as expected without any surprises, good or bad, and did what I expected it to do (met expectations; might recommend if a good value)2 STARS - Item easily wore out or didn't work as well as described, was disappointing for the price, and/or was of poor quality (might return if expensive; would not recommend).1 STAR - Item easily broke/failed, did not match description and was not useful or did not worked as described (do not buy; return if possible; would not recommend; junk/waste of money).",

These may be a perfect use as well for applications where you want to apply and remove them frequently or soon after application.",

They nice and long so they will work for just about any normal application and the brown color is perfect for outdoor/farm use since it just blends in with the trees/fences/stables. They are also pretty heavy duty and hold up well in the sunshine. I haven't had a single one break down from the UV yet, so they must have some UV stabilizer in them as well.",
