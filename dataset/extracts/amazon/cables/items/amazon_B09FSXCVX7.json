Note the black zip-ties are UV resistant, and should be used when exposed to sunlight or artificial UV. The white or \"natural\" zip ties will break down in time when exposed to UV. Even a fluorescent light, which emits very low levels of UV, will break the white ones down and fail in time. Typically, the black ones will survive years in the presence of UV - I can't say I have ever had one fail where UV was the sole point of failure. White ones, on the other hand, I have 100% seen fail on multiple occasions. So, if it's in the dark, white is fine. Exposed to any light for any period of time during the day, spring for the black ones....",

Note that the first inch of each tie is NOT ribbed so I had to count on about 1/2\" of ribbed surface to be \"grabbed\" by the receiver. It worked 100% of the time and it is still holding after more than a weekend's time.",
