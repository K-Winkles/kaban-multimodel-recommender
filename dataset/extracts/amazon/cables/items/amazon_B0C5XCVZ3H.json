In my uses I believe that I can confirm its specs of 10Gbps and 3A fast charging. I like the cable's physical quality -- it is reassuringly thick but still soft and flexible. Both (gold platted) connectors seem really solid and fit snugly in ports.It isn't the cheapest thing around but its quality and performance seem to justify that.(Curiously, the cable also made a very very old Pixel 2 (don't ask) be manageable by a computer, which other cables that I had lying around couldn't do.)",

                "reviewText": "I purchased a new computer that didn\u2019t have many input ports\u2026 so, I had to buy a USB hub. In order to connect my secondary external hard drive, I was needed a USB A to USB C cable. And this little jewel was the one.It does EXACTLY what I need it to do! It allows me to plug my external drive into my USB hub.I\u2019m no expert when it comes to computer hardware, so I can\u2019t provide you with any specs on transfer speed. But for my home use, this thing seems to be lightning fast and does its job efficiently and effectively.I\u2019m VERY pleased to have my backup external hard drive up and running\u2026 thanks to this cable!",
