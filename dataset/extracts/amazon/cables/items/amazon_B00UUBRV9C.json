                "reviewText": "I needed a cable to connect my AlphaSmart 3000 keyboard (remember those? They date from the last century) to my new Mac. I use the AlphaSmart to write brief notes when I don't want a light-up keyboard to disrupt my diurnal rhythms, such as keying in notes from a fencing lesson late at night. It's also very light, so good to take on long trips or hikes. Anyway, the cable that the now-defunct company furnished to allow me to download text to my computer ends in a USB-B connector, and my new Mac has a USB-C socket. I figured I'd never find a cable that would directly connect my dear old AlphaSmart to my Mac. I thought I'd need one of those awkward USB-C to USB-C cables. But I found it! I had to look carefully at the pictures to make sure the plus was exactly right, but i ordered it, it was inexpensive, it arrived the next day, and when I went to connect the two devices, it worked perfectly. Cool!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered a USB-C to -A cable from Cable Matters with fulfillment (packing and shipping) by Amazon from one of their warehouses. A couple of days later I received an empty envelope--no cable or packing slip or anything. I contacted Cable Matters via email and explained the situation. I received a very nice reply from Chelsea saying that since fulfillment was by Amazon I should contact them at the phone number she supplied or via their contact page.I tried the number and got a message that, due to COVID-19, they weren't answering phone calls. I tried to do a \"return for replacement\" but no matter what option I selected the Amazon web page insisted that I return the missing product. Duh! I then tried their automated \"chatbot\" but twice ended up waiting endlessly for it to return from a \"Give me a minute to check on that\" reply.I gave up and contacted Cable Matters and explained the \"Catch 22\" I had encountered. Chelsea immediately replied, asking for my shipping address, saying that they would ship a cable directly to me from their stock. I complied and a short time later the cable was on its way to me.Thanks, Cable Matters and Chelsea. It's refreshing to find an Amazon partner merchant that truly accepts their customer's problem as their own.As for the cable, it's excellent quality and it works. What else can I say?",

Not much to say - it's a USB cable, so it's either going to work or not work. So far mine has worked as expected.",
