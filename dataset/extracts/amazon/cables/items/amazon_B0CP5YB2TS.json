                "reviewText": "I have long been a big fan of cables from JSAUX. They\u2019re always well-made and I haven\u2019t yet had to replace any of them (USB, HDMI, DisplayPort). These cables feel just as high quality as the other JSAUX cables. The cable itself is braided and each comes with an attached hook-and-loop cable so you can wrap up any excess cord. The ends have a clear see-through plastic casing and the power rating (100 watts) is printed on one end of the cable. I don\u2019t have anything that consumes 100 watts but I do have a battery pack that can be charged at a rate of 65 watts. These cables charged the battery pack at 65 watts (though the reading read slightly higher than 65 watts) and the connectors never got hot. The only negative I can think of is that these cables are white and will probably look dirty at some point but that\u2019s just a nitpick. Overall these are great high quality USB-C cables!",

                "reviewText": "This set consists of two cables, each about two meters long, with a thick braided white cable body and a distinctive white/acrylic/metallic plug on each end. The ends are formed from a metal core covered by acrylic, keeping them relatively scratch free, and the ends and included velcro cable ties are silk screened with \"100W\" to help document what the current carrying capacity of this cable is, which is appreciated.I tested charging multiple laptops, including my MacBook Air 15\", with these and it worked like a charm at full charging speed. They seem in spec and to have a proper eMarker as required by USB-C standards.JSAUX has quickly developed a name for themselves as a reliable accessory brand, starting with Steam Deck accessories and branching out from there. I'm pleased to discover their cables are just as nice as their other accessories, and I'll keep an eye out for more of these in the future.",

This looks like those cheap vinyl usb cables,, but it is actually nylon braided. There is no transparent shell, so I don\u2019t know what that means. The data transfer rate is slow, which means this will mainly be used for charging.",

                "reviewText": "These come packaged in a little box, that makes them giftable if you'd like. Each of the transparent portions are wrapped in a plastic liner to make sure they don't get any scratches on them before they arrive, as well as some plastic casings for the C-ports. As a bonus, it comes with two cord wraps to keep them inline.The cable itself is really great. It's nice and flexible, and can bend into a tight enough circle to fit my thumb through. The braiding is very pleasant and soft to the touch, as actual fabric instead of nylon thread, though even a day out of the package I found that it has some abrasion fluff/tearing near the heads of the cord. I love the touch of the transparent plastic, but it does make the head of the cord longer than most.Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "The look and feel of these cables appear that they are quality built. The length is perfect for using my laptop or phone without having to be tied down near an outlet. They work good on all of my devices and stay cool during heavy charging times even when connected to a high wattage charging block. The velcro strap on the cables make storing them neater and keeps them from coming uncoiled. The first impression of quality was that each connector being capped when I opened the package, The caps are very useful during storing the cables either in a drawer or in my backpack to protect the connectors from being damaged. The connectors are nicely put together and appear to be very solid in construction. I anticipate that these cables will last for a long time.",
