At the same time, there is no need for digital/analog or analog/digital conversion before signal transmission, which can ensure the video and audio signal transmission. The HDMI cable supports a data transfer rate of 5Gbps, which is enough to handle a 1080p video and an 8-channel audio signal. And because a 1080p video and an 8-channel audio signal requires less than 4GB/s, the HDMI cable has a lot of headroom. This allows it to connect the DVD player, receiver and PRR separately with a single cable. In addition, HDMI supports EDID, DDC2B, so the device with HDMI has the characteristics of \"plug and play\", and \"negotiation\" will be automatically performed between the signal source and the display device to automatically select the most suitable video/audio format.",

HDMI has the advantages of small size, high transmission rate, wide transmission bandwidth, good compatibility, and can transmit uncompressed audio and video signals at the same time.
