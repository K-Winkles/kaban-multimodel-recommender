                "reviewText": "I originally gave this a one star review as both of my cables did not work with a 2021 Macbook with the stock charger ( I thoroughly tested each port with each orientation on each cable ). It worked great with my Android phone.The build quality of the cables is otherwise good and they fit snug.I'm changing my review to 5/5 because after giving the 1/5 review, JSAUX did reach out and try to help. I was a bit annoyed at their suggestion that it was the (STOCK!) charger from Apple, but the ad does say \"100W\" and the charger is 140W. I would have expected 100W charging though, but the Macbook acts as if the cable is being repeatedly connected and disconnected, no charging. It did work with lower current USB-C chargers, but at a much slower rate (1/10 of what I get with other off-brand cables from Amazon). I really just wanted (and still want) a longer one.Anyways, JSAUX refunded the cables without me asking for a refund. I don't think they intended to mislead but I don't think they tested 140W Apple chargers either.Buying non-major-brand cables online is always a bit of a gamble, but at least if you get burned by a JSAUX cable, they'll probably help you out without much hassle, perhaps without you even asking.",
