                "reviewText": "I'm all for minimal packaging, and getting rid of as many single-use plastics as possible, but I think the GE RG6 Coaxial Cable, 50 ft. F-Type Connectors, Quad Shielded Coax Cable, In-Wall Rated (Black, 33532) may have gone a little too far. You get a coil of cable with a small carboard hanger. My issue is that the F connectors aren't covered in any way, so the center pins can (and did, in my case) get bent. It's not the end of the world, but it wasn't unavoidable, either. As far as cable goes, I don't have coax ports on my Fluke, so I can't say how \"good\" it is. What I do know is that I'm getting nearly the same signal strength with the extra 50', as I got before putting that section on, so I consider that a good result. I ran the cable in a basement ceiling, and it's not far from a mains trunk line running to a subpanel, and it still seems unfazed. Recommended",
