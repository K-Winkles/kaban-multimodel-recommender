                "reviewText": "Chargers aren't something that last forever, but these are great for their lifespan. These chargers are very durable with their braided cable design to the point where I have never the charger physically or externally break on me.The charging speed is pretty good, and the longer length cables are great for reaching your bed or your desk. The smaller length cables can be used for your car or as a spare.Overall, a great choice for an affordable pack of quality chargers.All chargers will eventually break, but with these chargers you won't have to break the bank.",

                "reviewText": "In general, the cables perform well. The different lengths come in handy for different uses. The only problem I had is I used one of these in my Truck with Apple Car Play. We live in Wisconsin where in the winter, we get a lot of snow and they put a lot of salt on the roads. The end of the cable fell into that slushy mix once when I got out of my truck and disconnected my phone. After being exposed to that salty snow mix, the connector corroded rendering the cable useless. Cleaning the connector proved futile. Other than susceptibility to easy corrosion, they perform well. Piece of advice, pay attention to the environment that you are using them in as they are not as durable as they could be. There are contact platings that would reduce this problem, but that would add to the cost.",
