I'd prefer that it report out average power over some period like 1 or 2 seconds rather than what appears to be instantaneous changes2) Display is relatively dim compared to real USB-C power meters or a USB-C cable with builtin display3) While power can flow throw this product, when I tried to use it in an application where power and data were flowing, it didn't work for me.Overall: it really depends on what one is looking for. This is NOT a full-function USB-C power meter, but it might be a great bargain for some who have lower expectations.",

                "reviewText": "These are amazing. USB-C has introduced both simplicity and complexity to charging cables. I use these to confirm charging speed on airplanes (from the screen and from the power outlet -- VERY different). The number lights up and you can quickly glance at it to confirm your phone is still charging, for example from a loose outlet where your charger brick might loosen and stop charging. Love this on airplanes, love this at airports, love while travelling, love in hotel rooms, love when using travel adapters, love when using charging pads. I also use this to confirm which cables are slow-charging. I've purchased probably 10 of these so far and give them to my family. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "While being able to keep an eye on the amount of power going to the device and whether or not you are utalizing PD (Power Delivery where supported) it is connected to, you can definetly know when the charge is complete. With this it can add the feature to know how much is going into the device with standard cables. However, one thing I have come to find, the display does not stay on when power draw is about 2W (Watts) or under which would be ideal when connected to a power bank, but when connected to a wall charger, to me does not matter too much for which this will be used. Apart from that this is a nice option to have when using random cables I have lying around the house and still want to see the amount of power used.",
