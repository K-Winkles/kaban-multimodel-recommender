If the data transfer is true as advertised, or if it can handle I bet high load as a pd. But I have just used it as applied. And it's nice. I prefer a lot of chords and plugs. And we all know and are familiar with the braised lines. But these just 'feel' like quality. Heavy and stiff. With a firm engagement when you insert it. Time will tell. But I am very satisfied witness so far.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased to use for data in a new vehicle. The first cable would charge, but not make a data connection. A replacement cable was sent with the same issue. After that one, I realized that the phone cover was contributing to the issue. It appears that the USB cable that I have been using prior had always worked fine with the same phone cover in place. After the replacement new cable, I found that if I pressed and wiggled the plug at the phone a data connection could be established.Conclusion: The contacts of the new cable plug must be slightly recessed in the plug (in comparison to my original cable) and are not fully making connection when the plug may not be fully seated. Resolution: I carved out some more in my phone cover for the USB port hole. This seems to resolve the connection issue.Otherwise, the cables appear to be quite serviceable. Just be certain that you are able to fully seat the cable plug into your device.",

However, the actual one is far from the image. It's nylon braided and regular tin-chromium plated. Second is the performance issue. I use a OnePlus 9 phone with its original 65W charger and original red cable.I tried charging my phone with the cable replaced with the same charger. It is much slower than the original cable that costs Rs.899/- on the OnePlus website. So this cable at a price tag of Rs.789/- is totally NOT worth it.I would like to return this product as I'm not satisfied with its performance and actually quality.",
