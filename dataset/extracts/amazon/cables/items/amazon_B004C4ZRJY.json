                "reviewText": "When it comes to coaxial cables that are worth it, I would say that Monoprice's coaxial cables are the best.I recently bought an Antop Big Boy antenna at a local bin store in my area that came with a long coaxial cable. The cable was so long that I did not have room.So, I order the 1.5-foot coaxial cable from Monoprice and it worked out just fine. I was kind of skeptical about this, but I feel like this coaxial cable works fine.I hooked the cable onto the antenna along with the short range/long range antenna amplifier supplied by Antop and it hooked up just fine.I want to thank Monoprice for such an amazing cable, because not only is it worth it, but it is also durable. I will get another one someday, but I am enjoying the cable I got.",
