                "reviewText": "I'm always on the look out for good quality USB-C cables, and this one certainly caught my eye. The silicone sleeve is really nice, and overall the cable has a great feel to it. It is nice and flexible, but doesn't feel fragile. The usb-c connectors are really nice. I included a shot so you can see how it stacks up compared to a more typical braided usb-c cable. The bright orange is nice too, as it stands out in situations like with a chair, where I might accidently run over other cables that blend in a little too much.It's been my go-to cable for charging my headphones. Because of the flexibility, it's the most comfortably to have plugged into my headphones while I'm actively wearing them. Starting to feel like I want to get a couple more though.",
