However, I use this cable to connect my iPhone to Apple Carplay. I found that my connection to Apple Carplay would randomly disconnect, and then reconnect. I cannot be 100% sure it's the cable, but it does not happen as often with other cables.\"I have another brand of short cable in same car for Carplay, and that one works much better for that application.So, if your focus = just charging, and you need short length to do just charging, it's a good value.",
