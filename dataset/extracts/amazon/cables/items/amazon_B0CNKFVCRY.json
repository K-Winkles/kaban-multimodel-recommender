I can\u2019t stress enough the quality of this cable, its flexibility, and quality stress relief. Time will tell if my initial impressions play out the way I expect, but the overall quality is excellent regardless of the price point - and considering the price, these are a stellar choice. I have paid a lot more for cables promising durability and high end performance only to end up with a sloppy device connection or a cable so stiff it\u2019s irritating to use. These cables are supple\u2026 like noodle supple - with a connector that has a positive and firm snap into place. So far\u2026 very impressive.",
