                "reviewText": "I bought several of these to replace a slew of high speed cables. My LG OLED TV is 4K/120 capable and using the old high speed cables was causing intermittent black screen for a few seconds, even though I could get 4K programming. After returning one TV (after troubleshooting with tech support) I was able to pinpoint the problem to the cables I had. After installing these Ultra High Speed cables, no more intermittent problems. These cables are well made, certified, and I really like the fact that they are labeled to tell you exactly what you have. So many HDMI cables are not labeled clearly so it is hard to know what you have. These are 10K compatible so I have some comfort future-proofing these cables at least for a few years. This is particularly important as I had to replace an older in-wall HDMI cable with one of these. And don't forget to replace any HDMI keystones with 8K capable ones too.",

                "reviewText": "When it comes to HDMI cables, cables that aren't certified are not necessarily inferior to the ones that are certified, but you still get some piece of mind by buying certified HDMI cables. This one is certified, and it is very affordable compared to most all other certified cables of similar length. All else equal, if the cost of the certified cable isn't much more than the cost of the cables that aren't certified, why not buy the certified cable and avoid the possible hassle of ending up with a cable that doesn't work? That's the way I figured it, and I bought this cable even though, as it turned out, I didn't need it.Even though I don't really need it, I would have kept it were it not for the fact that it is very stiff. At least it isn't like springy stiff cables that straighten back out as soon as you bend them. No, not like that. It will take a bend and retain the bend, just like copper ordinarily does. So the stiffness isn't that big of a deal, and they are inexpensive for the length. But it turned out that I didn't need, and didn't need to add the cable I've been using to my rather large collection of cables that I haven't used in a long long time. (Centronics parallel printer cable, anybody? How about a couple of those S-video connectors? Component video? Firewire? Or some of those specialty cables that you think might be specialty video cables from the 80s but aren't quite sure ...)Bottom line, certified longer cable at cost well below most all of the other HDMI cables that are as long and that are likewise certified. But it is stiff, not in a springy steel way, but rather a thick piece of copper way. But are you certain that you really need this new HDMI cable?",

                "reviewText": "I had been eager to revisit my movie collection stored on an old memory drive from 2018 when downloading movies was still a popular trend. However, when I attempted to watch the pictures or downloaded movies, they appeared pixelated and disappointing in quality. That's when I came across an HDMI cable that claimed to convert movies to 8K resolution. I was skeptical but decided to give it a try. I connected my memory card with the downloaded movies to the HDMI 8K cable, and it worked like magic! I can't even put into words how amazed I am by the level of technology we have now. I was able to enjoy my favorite movies that were saved on my hard drive, and the viewing experience was truly impressive. I highly recommend this HDMI 8K cable. It also has a convenient length of 1.5 feet, allowing for flexible connectivity between devices over a moderate distance. This cable is commonly used to connect devices such as TVs, monitors, gaming consoles, and media players that support 8K resolution, delivering outstanding audio and video quality.",

                "reviewText": "Looking for inexpensive HDMI 2.1 4k cables that are HDMI certified. The Ubluker 10k/8k/4k cables checked all the boxes I was looking for. The cables are braided and appear well-made. Checking the HDMI sticker on the bag with the HDMI App, verified the cables are HDMI certified. Using a 4k uhd player and a 4k monitor, the picture resolution and color looked great and there were no dropouts. Compared to a non-HDMI certified cable, the Ubluker looked a tad brighter, otherwise, all other aspects were the same. Didn't have any sources to verify capabilities of the higher speeds of 8k/10k. Happy with cables, they do provide some future proofing and the price was comparable to non-certified cables. Purchased a couple more in the 6' length to accommodate my home theater system. Rated 5-stars.",

After replacing it with this one, tests reported no errors and dropped frames fully disappeared.The cable, although flexible, has some rigidity and cannot be bent freely - which would not be a good thing anyway. It has a high quality sheeting over it and very sturdy connector.Very good quality at a very decent price.",
