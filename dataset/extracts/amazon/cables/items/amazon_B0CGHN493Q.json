Drywalled and finished the room only to discover when I went to terminate the ends, that one wire in the cable had no continuity. Had to swiss cheese the wall and replace. I chose this cable for the additional shielding and future upgradability. Works great and happy with the purchase.",

The speed increase is seriously underreported in the comments in my opinion. I have 1gig down and up to 50mbps up and even with my Firestick going I'm still pulling 850mbps down/41mbps up. Can't wait to try it while all of our devices aren't connected and I can get the connection to myself. I would imagine my upload will top out and so will my download.Also, this is probably a good time to get these cables while they are still relatively cheap, once this fast of internet becomes a regular, everyday product, the cables will likely skyrocket in price for a time (not investing advice).It takes a lot to surprise me and I wasn't sure if it'd make a difference or be a gimmick. Glad to say it was the former.",
