                "reviewText": "For the low price you get a large quantity of 12\" long zip ties that are well packaged along with a set of shears you can use to cut the ties. The package includes a separate large heavy-duty zip lock bag that is apparently intended to help you store the zip ties after you've removed them from the original sealed package, which is a nice touch.The manufacturer includes a note describing the product's warranty and their desire to help you address any product issues should you require it. I cannot imagine ever contacting them because these are zip ties, and they zip and tie exactly like you would expect them to, but it's nice to know the support is there.These aren't the strongest zip ties I've ever used -- the manufacturer states they have 40 lbs. tensile strength, and if I make a loop out of one of these zip ties I can easily break it by pulling in opposite directions with my bare hands. That said, they're very inexpensive and should do fine in applications where high tensile strength isn't required, such as cable organization. The ties hold firm and they don't show any signs of \"unzipping\" backwards once they have been tightened.The shears have no problem cutting the ties with low effort and have a fine point that makes them easy to work with. They are not the finest quality tool but they cost very little and do the job adequately.I'd recommend this product if you need a lot of low-to-moderate strength zip ties of this size for hobby projects at a low price.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. In my lifetime I have used thousands of wire/zip ties. When I saw this large quantity set, I was happy I was able to order them. I have given up on the really cheap ones like you buy at the local discount tool place. They work, but their failure rate is pretty high (depending on what you\u2019re using them for). These are way closer to the higher-end ties that I purchase from an electrical supply house.They are almost an inch longer than the typical 11\u201d tie (11.82\u201d). They are also a touch narrower in width. For me, this is a plus. This makes them a lot more flexible (a good thing) and easier to manage especially if working in tight quarters. They are rated at 40 lbs. We have tested them slightly above that rating and had no breakage or slippage.This 500 piece pack also comes with a pair of sheers/scissors that has a notch in the blade\u2026I assume for cutting the ties. It works ok. For general cutting of heavier material, the sheers do an acceptable job. They have also included a 50 piece bonus set of 5.7\u201d white ties. They seem to be of the same quality as the black one (but we did not test them).All in all, I am very pleased with this product.MY PERSONAL COMMENTS:I am an approved Amazon Vine Member. We are provided the opportunity to order (free of charge) many items that are new to the market, or where a seller just wants some additional exposure for their product. We are NOT required to review every item in exchange for using it. I personally only order products that are important to me (items I can use), or items that I have the ability to properly test (I have lots of test equipment) so that I can provide an honest evaluation & review (and not always a 4 or 5 star) based upon my use and testing of the product. Thanks\u2026feel comfortable with any information I provide in a review.",

                "reviewText": "I have unfortunately bought what turned out to be some terrible quality nylon cable / zip ties online over the years; they would break at the slightest bit of pressure when tightening them up. So, obviously I am on the lookout for ties that are a bit more (shall we say) robust. These fit the bill nicely. I have to say I was a little concerned when I first opened the package because they are a bit thin / narrower than what I'm accustomed to. But, they are pretty strong. I took a couple and zipped them around the arm of a lawn chair (to test out their strength), and I could tug on them pretty hard when tightening up the zip. I found I could eventually break off the excess tie if I pulled hard enough, BUT where it broke was at the zipper, so the tie still held on (actually I could argue that was pretty convenient in that I didn't have to snip off the end).The package also came with a pair of snips that work very nicely. I'll probably not use them with the zip ties, but it is a handy pair of snips nonetheless. And, they included a small bonus pack of shorter cable ties in the package. Always nice to get something unexpected (and useful). Nice deal.",

                "reviewText": "This is the size I use the most. I use them for a variety of things but mostly to hold accessories to my bicycle. A lot of these accessories have mounting kits but they are rather flimsy. So I use cable ties for a lot of them. I usually go through a few dozen a year and frankly am tired of finding them only in small sets. I saw this and fell in love. The included scissors was also a selling point.I used four of these to secure a large cargo basket to the back of my bicycle. I rode ten miles with forty pounds of cargo in the basket and after the trip I inspected these and they had not loosened up at all. So I've been doing this for nearly a week now every day and still no loosening. Other cable ties would be wobbling in three days requiring constant tightening.I tested one of these and it took 43 pounds of static weight before it began to stretch and another ten pounds to snap it. That's pretty amazing to me.I highly recommend these cable ties for any application where they are needed.",
