                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Anker USB C to USB C Cable, and it has truly exceeded my expectations. This cable's compatibility is impressive, seamlessly working with my iPhone 15 Pro, iPad Mini 6, and even my MacBook Pro 2020. The 6ft length provides the perfect balance between convenience and flexibility, allowing me to comfortably charge my devices without being tethered too closely to the power source.One standout feature is the incredible 60W high-speed charging capability. It effortlessly delivers rapid charging to all my USB-C devices, ensuring they're powered up in no time. The durability of the cable is a game-changer; the hard-wearing nylon exterior and bulletproof fiber core make it robust enough to withstand my everyday usage. With a remarkable ability to endure up to 12,000 bends, I no longer worry about wear and tear.What sets this product apart is Anker's commitment to quality. The inclusion of a hook-and-loop cable tie adds to the overall convenience, making it easy to manage and store the cable. Anker's worry-free lifetime warranty and exceptional customer service are the cherry on top, providing peace of mind for any potential concerns. If you're in the market for a reliable, fast-charging USB C cable that stands the test of time, the Anker USB C to USB C Cable is an absolute must-have! 5 out of 5 stars!",

From this point on, here's the new agenda\u2026. if it works as advertised, is well made, meets or exceeds the description, is a value, and arrives in a fair amount of time, it will get a \"star rating\" equal to what my expectations were/are. If it doesn't meet these criteria, then I will most definitely and descriptively tell the short comings of the products and you as a consumer will not have to go through the trouble of buying the product without some background knowledge. If the sell pulls that item and relists under another description, I will put the exact same review on the seller's feedback page. Sellers have done this a couple of times in the past, and I was true to my word then as well as now. DR",

                "reviewText": "I love these charging cables. They're a good value for their durability and reliability.But here's something you should know about them: They're meant primarily for *charging*, and in my experience do not offer consistent support for data transfer between USB 4 or Thunderbolt 4 ports.What's frustrating is that these cables *sort of* work for data transfer. For example, you can use one to connect an external hard drive to a laptop (Samsung and SandDisk SSD's to a MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro chip in my case). The drive will appear (mount) on the computer, but you may not be able to access all of its files. In the worst scenarios I've experienced, this imperfect connection creates the appearance of malfunction and significant data loss on the SSD.It took some cable swapping and troubleshooting to determine I was confusing this charging cable for a USB4 or Thunderbolt 4 data transfer cable.Hopefully this review spares a few folks the unnecessary cold sweats I've had while using these for transfer.",
