                "reviewText": "My wife needed a new charging cable for her iPhone 11. Her old one, while it still worked, was getting frayed at the end. So I looked for cables and these are the one I decided to purchase. They are heavy-duty feeling, but flexible enough to not kink up when wrapped up and stored until the next use. She likes the color pink, so I got the pink for her. Too girly for me, though. definitely not a man's color. But it looks great to her. So far, the cables are doing a good job of charging her phone. The cable is not getting hot and starts to charge as soon as it is plugged up. I think they are a good choice, plus it has 3 different lengths in the pack depending on where she happens to be in the house.",
