                "reviewText": "I love that this cord is under 2ft when coiled, but stretches to nearly 6 feet if you pull on it. I suspect you should not pull all the way if you want it to continue to coil-up, but the dynamic 2-5ft cord is extremely useful as I am tired of knots of long wires on my desk, and in my car.I tried spindle-based cables, but they are not nearly as easy to use and break quickly, while flat wires inside usually are inferior to being with.Honestly, I do not understand why these type of coiled wires is so rare, it only has advantages as far as I can tell. There are two in the pack and both are thick and high quality as far as I can tell. If I discover something negative while using them, I will update this review.Based on my first impression and a few hours of usage, I would definitely order again.",

Working out of the package is more or less a given. What matters is can they be relied upon to work over time. For now, these USB C to Lightening cables work perfectly, look nice and seem well made. If anything happens within the next 6 to 12 months to alter my view I'll update this review assuming they are still being offered.
