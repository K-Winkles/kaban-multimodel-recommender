                "reviewText": "I wanted to use a soundbar with my TV, and not have to worry about loosing any connections due to wireless or BlueTooth. Thus, I picked up this cable.Connectivity was straight forward, plug both ends into where they belong in each device. I then had to tell the TV to use the Optical Out for sound. Pretty straight forward. While the sound will really depend on your equipment, the sound I got from using this was what I expected. It was solid and clear sounding.While the length is okay for this use, since both devices are right next to each other, a longer cable would probably be more beneficial. That's because if you ever move or rearrange anything, the short cable will limit those options - which means you'll have to buy a longer cable anyway.",

                "reviewText": "This cable seems of pretty high quality. The connectors are gold plates. The wire is wrapped in a somewhat flexible fabric. Additionally, the grips for the connectors are easily handled. It certainly does what it's meant to do. I plugged it up to my sound bar and Xbox and the sound quality seems to be pretty good. No connection issues or anything either. The only downside I would have to say is the length. I wasn't necessarily paying attention to the length when I ordered it. 3.3 ft is not nearly long enough if you have your devices split up at all. For example, I have my TV and the sound bar mounted on the wall. The sound bar is slightly higher than halfway up the wall. My Xbox on the other hand sits on a table beneath them. This cable barely reaches and only if I stand my Xbox up on its side as opposed to it sitting as it should.Overall, it works well and seems of high quality. The sound comes through quite well. It's a great buy as long as your devices are set up close together. However, if you have any of your devices separated, similar to my setup, then I would highly recommend you purchase a cable that is longer than this one is.",

                "reviewText": "I was having trouble with audio latency using HDMI ARC through my TV to my receiver, so I decided to try out using the digital audio connection directly from my Blu-ray player instead. My old player used a coaxial SPDIF connection, but my current one only has an optical connection so I found myself needing a short optical cable to jumper between the two. They are right on top of each other, so this 1m long cable was perfect.I\u2019m happy to see that this has robust cable sleeving on the outside, which helps to avoid it getting snagged when running around edges and through cable management paths. The connector back shells unscrew, revealing nice strain relief overmolds. Make sure the back shells are screwed down tightly, as they were shipped a bit loose. In case you\u2019re not familiar, you also need to remove the protective caps on the end of the exposed fiberoptic at the tips of the cable.This was a great combination of good quality construction, useful length, and great price.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not a huge sound guru, but I wanted to try out the optical port on my TV and got this to see how it was. The cable is good, the sheathing is nice, and the cable ends feel well made, and can unscrew from their housing if you want to clean them or something. The fiber transmits light just fine, and its the right length. It works for me, and its nice it came with protectors for the fiber to not get damaged or chipped in transit. I'm happy with it, no complaints here.",

                "reviewText": "Quality of the Product: So, I grabbed this optical cable recently, and man, it's surprisingly good quality for the price. It's way sturdier than the flimsy one I was using before. Feels like it could take a bit of a beating and still work just fine.Functionality: The thing works like a charm. Plugged it in between my TV and soundbar, and the sound difference is definitely noticeable. It connects easily and stays put, which is more than I can say for some of the other cables I've messed around with.Design: It's got a braided cable, which not only looks cool but also adds to the durability. The metal connectors feel solid, a nice step up from the plastic ones that always seem to break. It's a small detail, but it makes a big difference in longevity.General Overall Recommendation: If you're in need of a new optical cable and don't want to spend a fortune, this is a great pick. It does its job well, it's built to last, and it won't break the bank. I'd easily give it a 4.5 out of 5 \u2013 great value for what you're getting.",
