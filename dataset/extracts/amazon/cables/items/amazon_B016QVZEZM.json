                "reviewText": "I had a long career in the audio industry, including back when Monster and others started coming out with so-called \"audiophile\" cables in the 70s (we sold them). Later on when working at a large speaker company one of the engineers, something of an industry figure, told me \"you can hear a difference between adequate and inadequate cabling. But the thing is 'adequate\" is a very low bar sonic bar. What matters more is durability and integrity.\" His point being there are not so much any differences in sound quality, but build quality is another matter.I've bought FosPower over the past year and love them for several reasons:1. They are built extremely well2. I've never had a problem with any3. They are pliant, not ridiculously thick and with big barrels like other brands. Which means they are a lot easier and gentler on vintage stereo gear. They fit old-style back panels easily and don't insist on impossibly tight retention which can actually damage old RCA input jacks (been there, done that)4. They are just slightly more expensive than plasticky cables of the grade that come with equipmentIt's all I buy now, highly recommended!",

While the sound was OK, I felt something was missing and after a few months of use, the caps came off and I had to glue them on.I then replaced those cables with these similar priced but FAR better quality FosPower cables. For the price, they are well-made, slightly thicker, so you can tell there is more material in the cable, and I get a clean sound from the lowest bass to the highest trebles. Very satisfied.",
