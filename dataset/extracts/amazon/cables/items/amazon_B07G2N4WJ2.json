                "reviewText": "This is a double shielded RG6 coaxial cable with the rubber strain relief as shown in the diagram. The cable itself does not state whether the cable is double or quad shielded, but the write-up shows that it is double shielded. I have not installed this cable yet, but it looks like a good sturdy cable. However, having purchased the Monster 50 ft cable and the MediaBridge 50 ft cable at the same time, I think the best cable for the money is the MediaBridge cable since it is quad shielded. The Monster cable is double shielded, but it is cheaper and it is at least as good quality as this Philips cable.",
