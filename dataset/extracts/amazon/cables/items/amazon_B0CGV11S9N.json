                "reviewText": "We had a cable repairman tell me that my old cables for my modem/router were outdated, and newer cables improved signal retention in the line. He made a cable cord that ended up being too short as we relocated the modem/router to a higher location to improve the wife connectivity throughout the house. I bought this cord to replace the one that the cable repairman recommended/made special for us. This one is even better than the cable company's personally made cable. It has the best/thickest connection to the modem/router, thick insulation around the wires, and the 90 degree angle is perfect for the back of the modem/router so we don't unnecessarily create a bend in the cord. Have had no known signal loss and way better wifi throughout the home since utilizing this coaxial cable cord!",

                "reviewText": "This cable I gotta say, it\u2019s my new favorite. Typically coax cable is very stiff and tough to work with. I\u2019m happy to say that this cable is much more workable and has just enough flex to hook up to your device without it pushing it into the air or in directions that are not ideal. Also the twisting of the ends, it was much more easier and smooth to connect compared to some of the other coax cables I\u2019ve worked with. Overall very satisfied with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Right angle coax connectors are far superior to the straight line style with wire sticking out at a 90 degree angle from the wall. Best for appearance and clearance to place furniture in front of the connector plate. I was very pleased to find that this RG6 coax cable is more flexible than I\u2019ve previously experienced with my old RG58s. It\u2019s difficult to show you by picture but the wire isn\u2019t as stiff as others enabling me to roll the extra and I\u2019m hoping to minimize loss with the gold and 6\u2019s insulation. (More length choice would be nice.)We\u2019ve disconnected from monthly cable bills and have a whole house digital antenna mounted on the house peak with the wire running to the cable box on the outside of the house. The cable box feeds into the tv splitter in the basement which feeds to all the prewired rooms.",
