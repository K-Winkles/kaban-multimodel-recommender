                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t write a ton of reviews, but felt obligated to based on my surprising experience with these chargers. It\u2019s a 3-pack, and I\u2019m currently still on the first cable in month 2 since my purchase. At the time, I paid about 4 bucks for it.I am very pleasantly surprised that the first one has lasted this long. Say it died right now, and each one lasts the same amount of time. That\u2019s 6 months for the 3-pack, which means that for charging cables I\u2019d only be paying $8 a year. Previously, I was paying $20 for a new charging cable 2-3 times a year. You really can\u2019t beat it for the price. My mom thought it wouldn\u2019t even last two weeks!For context, I am a chronically online young adult who spends 14 hours a day on my phone, and I am VERY rough with my chargers, hence why I kept having to always buy new ones. So yeah, A++ for the durability and price. Great value.",
