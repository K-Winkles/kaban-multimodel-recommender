This is solid and the 36 ft cord allows for me to put it by the window. I got 92 channels total. I live near Chicago and get a great signal as long as the antenna is faced south-southwest. Overall, pick it up if you have the means. The coupon helped out too for the cost. If you have doubts about which antenna to buy, get this one and if it sucks, return it. I dont think it will tho.",
