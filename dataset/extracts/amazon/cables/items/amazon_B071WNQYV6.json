The cables work exactly as you'd imagine, with a USB-A cable at the male end of the cable, and then three male adapters at the end of the cable. The main male adapter id a MicroUSB cable, one that would work on most traditional USB products, like most Samsung smart phones, the Xbox One controller, a PS4 controller, Anker PowerCore batteries, and most standard USB devices that support a MicroUSB port. From there, you can add small adapters onto the cable, one that supports Apple Lightning ports, which work in an iPhone or iPad, and then the newest USB type C devices, which are common in most newer USB devices like the Google Pixel, LG, some Samsung devices, Google Wifi, and other devices that USB C. The adapters are attached to the end of the cable and don't add very much bulk to the cable, they're pretty convenient.I bought it for one primary reason: My wife and I were expecting a baby and it was one of those utility cables that I knew that I'd end up using in the hospital because I thought at some point we'd probably one to charge a device, mostly our Kindle, iPad, MacBook Pro (2016+), our phones, both Google Pixel phones (Pixel XL and Pixel 2 XL), but also maybe even the Nintendo Switch. I also used this using a Anker power storage device with like ~21000 mAh battery which worked really well... this kept my wife's phone and other devices charged throughout the trip to the hospital and the ~2.5 days after delivery. We've been using this combination for about 5 days now, especially because it's tough for my wife to get around the house to plug in all of her devices, and it's become super easy. I can confirm that it works fine on our Kindles (two Kindle touch screen, the regular price one from ~2016 or so), but I haven't tried it on an iPad Mini yet, but I'd imagine it'd work just about the same as anything else would. I also haven't tried it on my MacBook Pro (2016 touch bar), but again, I have no reason to doubt that it'd work.The cable isn't long, I don't know the exact measurements, but it should be in the product details. The cord is not a threaded style like some of the of the other products that Anker makes, but it's still that typical rubberized coating that a lot of USB cables have. It seems pretty sturdy so far, and the length of the cable makes it less likely to bend at the connections because it's pretty short. A longer cable might be better for many people, but for our uses the thing works fine.One issue though, and this isn't one that i'd drop a star for it because I haven't seen any problems with it but it's something that concerns me, is that there's no USB trademark logo anywhere on the product. This really doesn't matter in most cases, but there's been some complaints from tech sites that non USB trademarked devices can sometimes be made shoddily and not regulate the power voltage that the devices are supposed to take. There's a few YouTube videos showing how cheap cables can show power voltage coming out of a charging device going into another device that uses, say, 5 volts, but then immediately unplugging that and plugging that into a device that uses 2.4v, it can cause trouble not regulating that and switching up. Again, I have not seen any of these issues in this model, but without the official USB license for the device it's something that I worry about... but this isn't something that I've seen with this product so I'm not dropping a square because it works exactly how it should manage so far.So far I'm liking it a lot and would recommend it for the price.",

You can keep a spare one in your car for emergencies or regular daily driving. 10/10 would recommend.",

It took me about an hour to realize that the phone was not charging. I tried charging my apple device, no luck. Just to make certain, I tried using a normal cable for both items and they were fine.At the airport, I saw the same cable and, because I really thought it was a wonderful thing to be able to carry a single cable in my pocket while I was touring, I ended up buying a replacement. It worked fine until, two weeks into my trip, it stopped working because the primary plug was too fragile and bent. The result was that, although I could charge the items needing that connection, neither of the other two connections were able to be charged.Obviously I really wanted this to work. But, unfortunately, I will stick with three separate cables from now on.",
