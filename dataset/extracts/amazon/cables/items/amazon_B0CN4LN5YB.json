                "reviewText": "This is a great buy for the money. I got this cable for my karaoke show because SOMEONE (brother-in-law, I'm looking at you) always likes to cruise the audience and sing to some unsuspecting female (the audience always loves this so I'm not really complaining!)This is an excellent cable, with metal (not PLASTIC!) XLR connectors and metal coils on each end as strain reliefs. The cable is substantial and all components are very high quality. I got the 100 ft one, and it is more than twice as long as my next longest mike cable... but so far, no hum or noise coming from the cable in a cranked-up amplifier. I'm pleased.A reviewer here mentioned a wiring error on the cable that could cause a ground loop or noise, and indeed my cable is wired that way too (pin 1 tied to XLR shell). In my application connecting a microphone to the karaoke amplifier, this doesn't appear to be a problem (I hear no noise at all). On my cable, the wire between pin 1 and the shell contactor could be easily snipped if that caused a problem.Here's something that I love about this cable... it's GREEN! All my other cables are black, but I may buy a couple more cables in different colors. This is because it makes it so easy to associate an input (and input controls) with a given mike, so I can adjust things in real time by color. Such a simple pleasure!I've had this cable in use for about 5 months now and it has held up very well under \"road\" conditions. It may be my favorite mike cable.Definitely Recommend.",

I thought it would be your average sounding cable, but actually sounds better then your average cable. Produced more midst and treble on my application. I went back and forth between this 100 ft cable and my cable and this 100 ft cable sounded a bit more clearer then the cable I had before this one. 100ft cable sounded a bit more clearer and midst and treble was a bit clearer and sounded very good.My only gripe now is I want this exact cable in smaller sizes to re run my some of my different applications and I can't seem to find this exact cable in smaller sizes. They do have some different style cables in smaller sizes but not this exact same one, I want the exact same cable that's in the 100 ft just in smaller sizes.I didn't find it when I looked for them.If they are available in smaller sizes and are exactly like the 100ft cable let me know please because this 100ft style cable sounded very well and I wanna run more of these exact cables in smaller sizes.

                "reviewText": "In the world of audio cables there is a minimum of necessary function and then there are infinite upgrades. There are plenty of fancier cables than these but these do exactly what I need them to do. I have a podcasting studio set up in a spare bedroom. I record both audio and video. I have a couple of R\u00d8DE NTG2's and an Audio Technica 2040 for guests. None of these are high-end performance premium mics. They are all pretty darn good and more than enough to record a podcast and have it sound professional. At my level I am not able to hear the difference in cables between this and the other budget cables I purchased from Sweetwater (who I love).Knowing what cable goes to what source is an important usability factor. These stand out and have springs on common wear points. Granted, my studio is not nearly as hard on equipment as being on the road would be. These will never mechanically wear out in my house. Overall, I like it, it does everything I could ask of it.",

I could not notice any loss of signal with this cable which is not the case with some 100ft length cables. We run this cable from the mixing board to the back of the room speakers and are very impressed with the quality with the sound of this cable. I'm a big fan of the spring shield as I feel it gives extra protection and support. The colored cable really helps in being to be visible so they don't get tripped over. In short, I would put this cable up against any of our other high priced name brands. Thank you.",

                "reviewText": "I got the 100 foot style. It's an XLR cable, female connection on one end and male connection on the other. I will use this to daisy chain a set of powered speakers to get better spacing. This could also work well in a permanent setup for a Microphone running into a mixer in an adjacent room. There's spring relief at each end and the quality of the connectors is good. In a brief audio test, the sound quality was fine, with no hum. Several velcro strips are included for tieing the cable off. Nice cable at a good price point !!",
