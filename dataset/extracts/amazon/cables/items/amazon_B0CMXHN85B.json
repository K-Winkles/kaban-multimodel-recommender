                "reviewText": "Since the world has moved to buying chargers separately from your phones/tablets that no longer include them now, I find that having cables that accompany chargers, which are also sold separately, is becoming more common in my household.Often Looking for a charger and a cable that can match the charging speed of any charger is very important. Not only for the charger, but to prevent issues with using cables that can't cope with the desired voltage of the charger, causing limited charge, or potential short if the cable is over strained causing damage to the charger or worse.This three pack is actually a fantastic addition to my household. This pack comes in 2 lengths around 3+ ft and 6+ft.Great to have length options depending on the need and location of the charger. Oh and did I mention these also function as a data cable as well. Though I have not thoroughly tested the advertised the 480Mbps to it's full capability, I have not encountered any issues using these cables to transmit data between devices.For the price, you are getting some solid cables, and have not had any issues at all. Very durable and so far very reliable cables, and very much recommend these if you are looking for more than just 1 cable and need multiple for various needs.",

                "reviewText": "These cables come in an interesting plastic package that has the 3 lengths separated individually. I always give braided cables an extra point since I live with cats who like to chew the non-braided cables. Hooking this cable up to a standard 15W charger block was able to charge my iPhone 15 Pro Max. The phone was already at 98% but I don't expect fast charging speeds with just 15W power block since it was only pulling 1.5A and just 7W. The cable can withstand 60W which seems pretty standard for a USB-C cable nowadays. This cable should handle Apple Carplay as well with the transfer speeds if you can get a USB-A to USB-C converter.This cable was also successful in charging an Asus ROG Ally using a 65W power bank with an output of 2A. Albeit slow, it is most likely my power bank and charging blocks that are causing such slow speeds.Having x2 3.3ft of USB -C cables will come in handle since having a super long cable is not really necessary nowadays when you have access to power banks in your backpack or pocket.All in all, these cables work as advertised and I'll be using these as a daily driver in my charging needs.",

I don't know if it's necessarily a downside, but they're a bit stiff and haven't seemed to gotten any less so after a week of use. And while I haven't had any problems with them, they don't exactly seem like they're built for the long haul. But so far, so good, I'm happy.",

I\u2019m keeping these stationary in my truck for use with my iPhone 15 plus. Always bees using the Apple charge cable. The white gets so dirty and disgusting. I figured I would give this a try and get away from they typical.So far these are a good and charge well. I just use the standard DC port. No adapters and charging blocks (AC). Charges decently fast. I am pretty impressed and an quite happy.These USB-C snaps right-in and snug into the PD port and into the charging port of the mobile device. I love the braided feel and the intended durability of the these cables. I am counting on these less to last awhile and and longer than the tag alongs that come with the mobile device.",
