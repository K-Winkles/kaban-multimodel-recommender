They don\u2019t tangle and fast charge works perfectly. I also love that they are so long and I don\u2019t have to worry about also using an extension cord. Feet buy and I recommend as a replacement wire not just for MacBook but also works for my iPhone and my wife\u2019s android and anything else with a USB C connection.",

Each Pi had a large power brick with a fairly thick cable, so I wanted to consolidate to a single power supply and more flexible cables. These fit the bill perfectly.These are well made, about the usual thickness for USB C cables, but are a bit more flexible and with less memory than average making routing them through my rack to the back of my Pi cluster very easy. Each Pi requires approximately 15W of power out of the box, but I'm running each with an SSD rather than SD Flash card, so I figured these cables rated for 60W would be more than sufficient for the Pi's power needs. I plugged these into a 4-port 100W GaN USB charger and eliminated the four separate power bricks and cables. I'm happy to say that my Pi cluster is running just fine from the new power supply configuration.Note that I am using these strictly for power delivery so I cannot speak to their data transmission bandwidth.I'm very happy with the construction, flexibility, lack of memory, and performance of these cables and will not hesitate to purchase these again when needed.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using primarily dark-colored cables all my life, but I recently started work on a room in my house where I really needed white cables in order to blend in better.These cables are packaged separately in a continuous strip of plastic, and they come with dust protectors on each end too. They feel sturdy and have the same rubberized coating that my MacBook cable does, although these feel a bit thinner and cheaper. However, they still provide plenty of power to charge my laptop no-problem.In short, they\u2019re strong, power well, and will likely hold up to wear. I will definitely be putting the spares in my go-bag and backpack \u2013 these would make great emergency charging cables too.",

The quality is good and length of the cable is good enough for most use. I can set up it everywhere I normally charge and don\u2019t need unplug and plug. Nice.",

                "reviewText": "This is a decent value for the price for 4 quick charge USB-C cables. The length is fine for most household uses, though they may be too long if you plan to use these in your car. When used with a wall brick that I already had, they quick charged both a Nintendo Switch and a Samsung S22 Ultra with no issues. Considering they aren't braided cable, they feel pretty sturdy for what they are; about on par with a cable that would be included stock with most devices.",

I was impressed to see that each end of the USB-C cable had little plastic dust covers. This will keep the ends from getting dirty or dusty (or wet) and they'll be ready to use no matter how long you keep them in a dusty storage bin.",
