                "reviewText": "It's difficult to find 10 ft or longer cables for 100W USB C charging cables. Especially a more trustworthy product.Personally, I don't understand why cables in general cost much (aren't they just wires?), but I was originally burnt by a fake USB C charging cable elsewhere. In the electronics section, the 'gold standard' is generally Anker. And then there's the \"other companies in China\" which are often much cheaper. Well, I originally took the latter deal and how horrible of a mistake it was. The cable didn't work and I had to get a refund. Judging by the standards of most cheap 100W USB C charging cables from Chinese companies, they are all either poorly built (won't last long) or a fake product (eg: not 100W despite the claim on the cable).Well, this is my first time testing out Uni Accessories for electronics. I must say, I was astounded by the quality of the product.The cables as you can see are thick and well made. And best of all, IT WORKS. It's a 10 ft cable that WORKS. I'm sick and tired of cheaper cables which actually don't provide the wattage they claim and/or be poorly constructed.I have updated the \"rankings\" of which companies I should trust going forward for electronics.1. Uni Accessories2. INIU3. Anker... (a bit of drop in quality but still gets the job done)4. UGREENAnd that's it. I have heard of 'Baseus' but never had experience with a product from the company so can't believe.These are for me the 4 brands I can now 'trust' as a 'go to'.Enough with that. Back to the cable.Very well built (much better built than even an Anker equivalent). Cables are on the thicker side so it feels good quality.And it lets me charge my laptop from my bed. What more can I ask for?Personally, I wish packaging wouldn't be so big for such a product but that's a complaint which is irrelevant to the actual product itself.10 out of 10. I will add Uni Accessories into the list of companies I can trust going forward for electronics.",

As someone who has been a loyal Uni customer, I've come to expect reliability from their products, and this cable certainly lives up to that standard. The connectors fit snugly, ensuring a secure connection, and the cable's flexibility adds to its overall convenience. I've tested it across various devices, and it consistently delivers a swift and stable data transfer. Additionally, the sleek design and reinforced connectors contribute to both aesthetics and durability.

After 2-1/2 years of reliable use, the fabric casing started to pull and then one end got weak and stopped working. This is usual for most cables on the market and even at times the metal reinforced kind.Here is well this cable differs from the rest, even OEM Apple's cables. I got out my Amazon order details, registerd on Uni's site my product and submitted a warranty claim with order details and pictures of the product. Within hours, I got a response and within days, a replacement cable was on its way.Considering the great product build, and lifetime warranty, I would highly recommend buying from UNI.",
