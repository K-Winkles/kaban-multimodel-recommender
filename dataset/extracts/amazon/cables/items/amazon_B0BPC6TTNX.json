As cables go, these seem really well made. The cable feels thick and durable. They also have the velcro strap for storage on trips etc! Very pleased!

                "reviewText": "I purchased these USB C to USB C cables to use mostly for charging applicatoins with Apple products. The cable connectors do not have the same positive snap-in experience you get with Apple cables but do hold in securely once installed and do not wiggle around. The cable feels sturdy and flexible enough, although not as flexible as the new Apple woven cable. The woven jacket feels tough and durable. The strain relief is securely fitted around the cable jacket to help prevent breakage at this point. The cable is very well constructed overall. The included hook-and-loop cable tie is a nice extra but the outer hook surface can get caught on things, like clothing, unintentionally. These cables are an excellent value and I would purchase again if needed.",

                "reviewText": "I think the cable is great, except for the braiding. The velcro cable tie, being itself of good quality, is enough to attach and pull some of the strands of the braid. My only concern is how long this would last. Otherwise, I trust Anker is generally great - after owning many of their products that have never failed me before.",

                "reviewText": "I would be lying if I said we are not constantly impressed with Anker and their quality. We have bought a few different products of theirs for years now, and all of them continue to hold up to the testament.I bought this two pack to replace my OG Samsung cord that has decided to give up the ghost and started fraying near the charge port. Of course, we went straight to looking for Anker as a replacement, because I have had great success with them with previous Samsungs. Now, we all know Samsung can be a bit finnicky when it comes to their charging habits. You have to have the OG block and the OG cord, or your phone yells at you that it \"may not work effectively\" or yaddayaddayadda.We got this package within the estimated time for delivery and immediately I opened it and hooked my phone up to this with the OG Samsung block. I was met with a very long sturdy cord, a velcro strip to help keep the cord tidy when not in use, and my phone happily started charging with Super Fast Charging capabilities being available. I have tested the second cord, and I saw no issues with that one, either.Anker, please keep up the great work!! Thank you so much for preventing me possibly having to buy an original cord that could cost more than your two pack!",

                "reviewText": "I've gotten a couple pairs of the Anker 310, and it's the best value on the market right now for a jack-of-all-trades USB-C cable. I use it to charge my bluetooth headphones, bluetooth speaker, Switch, and Chromebook. This is also the cable I bring while traveling. The braided cord is nice in that it resists getting twisted or coiled up. The 310 design head is easy to grab with a nice, tactile feel. Only downside is that the braided cord gets frayed by the velcro strap. I know the strap is a nice bonus, but I always take them off because they can ruin my bag or clothing fabrics.",
