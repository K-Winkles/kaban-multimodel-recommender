                "reviewText": "Seems like a decent CAT7 cord. Rated for outdoor or indoor use.. but if you're going to have it running outdoors, know that it is not made for direct burial... Outdoor use accounts for things like UV rays. This cord shouldn't be buried without PVC or conduit, and it also should not be left lying on the ground. Burying it anyway or leaving it lying on the ground increases the risk of your system being damaged if lightning strikes nearby. So if lightning strikes the ground and travels, and its stopping point is your unprotected Ethernet cable, this can be detrimental to your internet, router, etc. Also, considering moles, voles, mice, or armadillos travelling through your yard. No protection for the cable could result in damage from critters. For outdoors, it's probably good to use around a doorway, in a shed, around the porch - but avoid making any 90-degree bends if putting it around something. I am sharing all of this information and don't exactly expect it to all be read; however, this is information that I did not even know until I researched this, which was after I had already bought one of these with the thought of \"outdoor\" implying it was capable of being buried outdoors. I still am making use of this cord though. And for what it is, it seems to serve its purpose well enough that I would still give it 5/5 stars for its functionality, and the pricing is good compared to other CAT7's I've seen that aren't nearly as long (I bought one that is over 100 feet on length). Hope this all helps someone one day though!",

I ran it along the ceiling in my condo and you can barely see it. Unfortunately I purchased 50 ft and it's not long enough I'm going to have to purchase the 75 ft. That's on me I should have measured more carefully rather than send this one back I'll just order another one 75 ft so I have extra.",

                "reviewText": "I decided to go with the length of 100 feet with this Cat 8 Ethernet Cable for my home office job, this way I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about if the cable was not long enough regardless of what room I moved my equipment into if I had to move my office to a different area of the house. I had my reservations of it working b/c of how long and thin the cable was. No worries whatsoever! Works like a charm \ud83d\ude09 \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe. Even when I\u2019m no long doing a remote job this cable I can always use in the near future if need be for other projects I\u2019m working on. I highly recommend. Look at it as an investment not an expense. =) Speed and Connectivity is Perfect and price is worth it \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe.",

                "reviewTitle": "Simplifies reliable home networking",
                "reviewText": "When it comes to setting up a home network, PowerLine adaptors are handy, 802.11ac WiFi is speedy, but nothing beats genuine hard-wired cabling for fast and reliable comms. It can work out cheaper, too.This is a Cat 7 cable. I needed to look that up - it means that each of the cable's four wiring pairs are not only twisted but also individually screened. This helps reduce interference in both directions - the cable is less likely to give off electrical noise and also less likely to suffer from it.Being so flat, it's easy to run under carpets and along skirting boards and a packet of 15 P-clips is included to help with installation. The cable appears to be well made, with protective caps on the plugs and protection for the locking tangs.However, and this is important, the vendor makes no claims for its fire resistance, so it's not suitable for running in building voids, or anywhere where it might be exposed to fire or would be inaccessible if it caught fire itself, unless a fireproof conduit is used. A true infrastructure-grade Ethernet cable has a sheathing corresponding to a standard such as BS2004.As for speed, Cat 7 should be good for 10Gb networking. Few domestic networks run this fast, with 1Gb being the normal standard. I tested it by transferring some large files from a NAS to my PC using this cable and got speeds of 100MB/sec, so it's definitely good enough for present-day setups. However, as Gigabit Internet rolls out, domestic networks will need to become speedier to take advantage of it, so a bit of future-proofing doesn't go amiss.",

                "reviewText": "Given the choice I always go for these flat cables rather than the standard round ones, they're much better behaved and don't coil themselves back up into loops as you're trying to get them out of sight behind furniture. They're also better if you need to hide them under rugs or carpets, though you generally want to avoid standing on them in case it breaks any of the copper cores. This 15m coil also comes with 15 nail-on clips, which are specially shaped for the flat style of cable, for fixing them onto walls or along skirting boards etc. Fifteen clips means you'll only have one every metre or so which isn't that generous so they need to be used judiciously.The actual cable performs just as you'd hope and delivers very speedy transfers and the Cat.7 specification should mean data moves as fast as your devices can handle it. The connectors are gold-plated which should mean tarnishing is never a problem and there's a handy flexible latch to make releasing the locking easier, especially in cramped corners. The shielding seems to be effective, at least I've had no problems with it, and speeds are excellent with no obvious dropouts. They're not the cheapest Ethernet cables but quality is good and the flat style is really practical.",
