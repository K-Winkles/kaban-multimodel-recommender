I have two cats and when I'm not charging my phone, the cats play with the cord. (I don't recommend this or at least unplug it first) the drag it, bite it, claw at it, play tug of war with it. It still charges my phone just as well as it did the day I got it. SUPERB!! I highly recommend these cords. You will not be disappointed!! Plus the price is a steal. You get way more than what you pay for. I guarantee it.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great product. Never failed to charge and charged fast. Braid is tough. Only issue is I figured it could take a beating when you accidentally trip over the cord and phone comes crashing down onto wood floor, charge port first. The plug on the end of the cable bent enough to break some sort of connection inside because it stopped charging my phone. I put a different cable to the phone to double check and phone charged. It is my fault for the drop but figured this unit could handle it.",
