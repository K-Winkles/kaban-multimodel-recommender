These are so handy to have around and have saved me from having to dig through my box of adapters saving me time and frustration. They work and are higher quality than I expected. You will not be disappointed with these. I have 2 in full time use for months with excellent results.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great little set. The quality and transfer performance is as good as anything I'd expect from pricier options. And the pack includes two of each type, which is a godsend for those of us who travel with our laptops.My newest laptop only has a USB-C free since the standard USB-A is taken up with my LogiTech mouse \"dongle\". So Type-C male to Type A female necessary when traveling if I need to plug in a typical thumbdrive or such.OTOH, I have a USB-A hub on my desk when the laptop is in its docking station. I recently bought a 256GB flash drive for backing up files that connects via a USB-C (amazing how small the 256GB drive is- wow!). So, I need the Type A male to Type-C female as well.And, it was nice to get a double set like this at such a great price. That allows me to keep one set at my desk and another in my travel bag, so I've always got them where I need them without having to remember to pack them.They are nicely packaged too. Would make great stocking stuffers or minor office gifts.",
