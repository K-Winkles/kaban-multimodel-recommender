I usually order custom cable lengths to simplify installations, but when not possible, wrapping them in a short coil with these velcro wraps works great. Make sure to trim them to length after 2 good wraps.I also have silicone-magnet wraps I use with these. Velcro for the permanent wrap, and the silicone wrap is included in the bundle so I have a temporary tie if needed. Have a bunch of cables in the same area? the magnet wraps can stack and bind them all together while still being able to pull apart as needed. Both together make for great cable management.",

                "reviewText": "These strips worked beautifully for lashing together multiple cables that carry power and signal to routers, modems, wifi, and various NAS disks that sit on a shelf over my desk. This makes for a much neater looking installation. These did not operate as I expected however.Normally with strips like this you wrap the strip around the cable bundle, insert the tail of the strip through the hole on the clasp then pull the strip back to tighten the strip around the cables. If you do it this way it won't work. The Velcro hooks/eyes are on the wrong side.So you need to insert the tail through the clasp, grab hold of the clasp, and then pull the tail tight by pulling it away from the clasp so it attaches to the Velcro on the clasp side. This works great, it was just not intuitive for me.These work quite well, hold firmly, and are a fantastic value for the dollar. If you have a thicker bundle of cables you can \"daisy-chain\" them together to make a longer strap. Works well as long as you do not try to fold them back!",
