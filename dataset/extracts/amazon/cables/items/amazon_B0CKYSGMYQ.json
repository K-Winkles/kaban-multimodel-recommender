Very sturdy build and the l-shaped design keep this from getting worn out over time. The white color also helps in keeping it less visible around my white walls. Otherwise, not much else to say. Does the job and for a good price.",

I use this to keep several game controllers charged and plugged in from across the room.While designed for WYZE Cam this works with several other devices in the same capacity.For the cost, this is a great deal on a lengthy cord.",

It is measured correctly from end to end. The connectors work great. Even comes with a baggie for holding up the wire, which is very useful.",
