I much prefer braided cables over rubber, but I also think the coiled pattern looks cleaner than a cable thats not coiled.The braiding is medium grade thickness and durability. Ive seen thicker, but this is pretty standatd thickness for braided cables",

                "reviewText": "These USB C cables are tailor made for in-car phone charging! No more wrestling with knotted messes and draping cables all over the console \u2013 the coiled design keeps them organized and ready for action.* Tangle-proof bliss: The coiled design is pure genius. No more untangling contortions! It's especially handy for travel or throwing in my bag or carrying in my pocket.* Fast charging: They juice up my Galaxy at lightning speed, no complaints there.* Sturdy build: The nylon braiding feels durable and high-quality. I expect these cables to last a good long while.Convenient length: 3 feet is the perfect sweet spot for charging in various situations. These are coils; so you can stretch them out if needed to make them longer. BUTA small wish:While I'm over the moon with these cables, one thought crossed my mind \u2013 adding a bitter flavor to the plastic ends could be a clever way to deter curious nibblers (hello, my mischievous pit bull!). It's a minor point, but for pet owners like myself, it would be a welcome bonus. I have lost type-C cables to my pibble more than once. I imaging people with rug rats may run into similar situations.Overall, these are fantastic USB C cables. Highly recommended, even for homes with adventurous furry companions!",

                "reviewText": "Love love love this coiled cable. I have used this cable in 3 different ways: 1) to use the iPhone 15/15Pro in our car with Apple CarPlay, 2) as a power cord to a Qi2 wireless charging mount in our non-CarPlay-equipped car, and 3) as a data sync table with my phone + MacBook Pro or Windows 11 laptop. It excelled in all 3 functions. I should also note it peformed just as well with a budget Android phone.Data transfers have been fast and error free, as expected. I have not experienced any wonky momentary disconnections as I have experienced with cheaper quality cables. It has always connected to CarPlay, every time. Coiled cables are ideal for the car because they keep your cord management nice and tidy. Life is too short to use a non-coiled cable and have your coffee cup caught up in a tangled situation while you are driving. Stay safe and go coiled!",
