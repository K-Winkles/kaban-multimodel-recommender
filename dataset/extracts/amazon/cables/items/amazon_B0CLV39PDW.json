                "reviewText": "I bought this thinking I could connect my phone to my 2005 beetle's existing audio configuration.It didn't work as I had hoped for. However it does have many other useful applications for this class of USB connectivity.This might not be very useful information as such. Maybe it is though. The most important thing to keep in mind from this though however, is that it will not work to connect your phone via cable to an older vehicle's Bluetooth to glove box stored adapter.If you have such a set up, then you probably understand what I 'm saying here.",

But as I began to charge my phone and use it over the last couple of weeks I noticed that it really doesn\u2019t charge that fast. I have it connected directly to a wall outlet that has a USB port so there\u2019s nothing diminishing the speed of the charge. When I use my other charger on the wall plug, it actually works pretty good compared to this one so I know it\u2019s not the wall outlet. I do like the length of it so I will continue to use it.",
