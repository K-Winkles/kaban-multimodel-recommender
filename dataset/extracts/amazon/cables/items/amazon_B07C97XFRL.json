                "reviewText": "This 10 ft cable is perfect! It's long enough to reach from the outlet to my bed so I can comfortably play my games (don't judge me)!! I got the black/silver cable and it's easy to find in the dark. It charges my phone charges quickly (a big plus) and it seems sturdy. I would definitely purchase this again. I also need to add that I'd purchase from the Deegotech Store because of their customer service. They are one of the few companies that unprompted, contacted me after the sale to ensure that the item was correct and fit my needs. They care about customer satisfaction and that inspires loyalty! I can't purchase from them enough to sustain their business but they will be one of my 1st stops and I WILL spread the word about a great company. THANKS DEEGOTECH!!I've had to update this review because last night, just a few days after the return window closed, this charger failed spectacularly. I fell asleep with my kindle last night. When I awoke a few hours, I picked up the kindle and saw a stream of smoke. Maybe I just got a defective product and I don't know what caused it, but it scared me. It continued to smoke as I attempted to disconnect it from the Kindle. I unplugged it from the wall to examine it - the unit was not frayed or compromised in any way - it was only a month old but fabric near the plug was singed. I'm thankful that I woke up before it caused a fire on my bed linens 'cause it's much too cold to stand outside as the house burns down.",

                "reviewText": "I originally reveiwed this product as 2 stars because of some issues (Ill leave the original review at the bottom). After leaving my review within a few days I was contacted by the seller wanting to make right by the situation. They asked what all had happened and expressed their apologies about the experience. It is now in the process of a new cord being sent out with no charge no need to return the original. I am beyond satisfied with the customer service and hope for a great experience to come!ORIGINAL:I was all for this product! So excited that it fit what I needed (long cord to reach lofted bed and durable, which it seems to be, there is not breakage or material fray) and had good reviews. This product worked great... for like 2 months. It was an average charger, not fast. Which was perfect because I used it for bed. Next thing I know I'm plugging it it before bed (at 42% battery) and it says it's going to take over 26 HOURS to finish charging. 26 hours to charge half my battery??? I tried unplugging the cord from device and the wall. Every time I was given a notification on my phone that the charger is running slow and I should use a different one. I plugged in another charger in the same spot and was given a charge for 2 hours. And love that I'm pretty sure I'm out of the return time frame\ud83d\ude14",
