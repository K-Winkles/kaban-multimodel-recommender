                "reviewText": "Can't speak to durability as just bought them. Perfect for the Samsung tablet. The right angle along with the space between the connector and the right angle cable makes it perfect even with a somewhat thick case and with a stand. Several other right angle cables didn't have the space between the connector and the cable and would not have worked with either the case or the stand. No trouble connecting with fast charger and also a slow charger in the office - both work perfectly. The variety of cord lengths make it easier to tidy up the desk space by using a cord of the needed length without having extra cord getting in the way. Will update in the future if any issues. So far they're perfect.",

Once again, I couldn't be more pleased with these cables.They are not only sturdy but also crafted with great care and exceptional quality. These cables are exactly the length they claim to be, which is a refreshing change from some products that fall short on their promises.The charging power of these cables is truly remarkable. They deliver a reliable and efficient charge every time. If you're in need of a set of cables in various lengths that you can trust to perform consistently, these are the ones to go for. They've certainly become my go-to choice for charging cables. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "Bought these hoping that they would actually work at being a fast charger to use with my power bank while at work I work in the medical field and can't just leave my phone plugged into a wall outlet as myself and my coworkers communicate through our phones and calls/texts Esperanto if there is an emergency situation so can't be in a different part or different floor than where my phone is plugged in charging and doing 12 hour shifts my phone tends to start getting a low battery little over half way through the shift so having a cable that does actually work and does actually fast charge my phone with my portable power bank is something that I needed and these cables came in an assortment of lengths which I wanted as I love long cables but the short cable are great for use woth power bank as it works perfect with having the power bank and my phone that is connected to the cable in my scrub pockets without feeling like too much in my pocket and with longer cables previously it wouldn't fit properly and couldn't walk around with my phone charging in my pocket due to the awkwardness but these cables for the price point exceeded my expectations especially compared to past experiences with other cables that claim to be fast charging but don't actually fast charge even when used in a wall outlet with a \"fast charging charging block\" would always get a message about the cable but these are totally worth the price and the assortment of lengths are great aswell!! As sometimes it's nice to have a short cable for people like myself using a power bank and when using a wall outlet at home the 6.6 and 10ft cables are great as my currently apartment doesn't have many outlets so the long length is great and i love the right angle as it doesn't feel awkward and works great and actually works with my phone case aswell!! Definitely recommend 10000%",
