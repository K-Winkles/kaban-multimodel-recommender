                "reviewText": "I like the woven nylon cover. These always seem more durable than a simple plastic/rubber covering.I compared the rate that my phone charged with this cable and it was about 20% faster than another high quality cable I recently bought.The flattened, angled cable on one end does make the attachment to the phone seem less likely to cause a crimp in the cable but, on the other hand, the flattened cable seems much more fragile than the round, nylon covered part. Obviously, even though it may be less likely to crimp, if it ever is bent, it seems likely that it would cause a complete failure of the cable.Another reviewer commented that the ribbon end of the cable could not be connected to their phone when it was in a case. I was able to connect my Samsung phone without any problem, but removing it required gripping it in a way that seems to put more stress on the ribbon cable, making it more likely to be damaged.So, while I like the idea of the angled ribbon connection, I'm suspect it will be prone to failure.So, it's a quality cable that quickly charges your phone but I have doubts about the durability.",

                "reviewText": "I picked this up to use on my GoPro to keep it plugged in to an external battery pack. The flat right angle is the perfect design to plug in to the media mod in the back of the camera and let it lay flat against my chest while recording. It worked great for the first 2 hours of using it and it did exactly what I wanted it to do. It is very flat and does not get in the way.The problem with this is the flat design makes the cord very fragile. I got the cord stuck on a fishing rod and it ripped with just a little accidental force. It ripped the wires right off the terminal part and it twisted too. It was instantly useless. I know I was being a little brave thinking this would last while filming fishing videos but I thought it would at least survive a few accidents. The strange thing is that the design seems like it's catered to a purpose like I used it for but maybe it's more for using on devices that don't move. If you need it for a computer or attaching a component in a tight spot that won't see any movement it'll be great. Just don't plan on using it in a moving situation.",

                "reviewText": "I love the idea of this cable. Having more options to control how a cord sticks out from a device is a great design choice, and having them on hand is really handy (sorry for the pun).There's two main factors that make me unable to give it five stars. First: the section of cable that changes over to the angled plug feels VERY flimsy. I'm extremely worried that regular use will lead to it not holding up for very long. Second, the plug is very hard to pull out of whatever device you plug it into - especially if you've cut your nails recently. These two compound on one another, as it often feels like I have to almost yank on the cable to get the plug free, which is Never what you should have to do to unplug something!Overall, I'd definitely recommend looking at a different option for an angled USB-C plug. There's a LOT of them out there. Even if you just went with an adapter that can hook onto the end of a normal cable.",

                "reviewText": "I really love this charger! It charges fast and with the flat 90-degree cable on it I can use my phone or tablet easily while charging. I just wish it was longer.The flat cable means I won't end up damaging the cord by bending it to much or damage my phone charger port by putting pressure on it. It's really awesome. I can't say much about longevity since I just recently got it but I'm loving it so far.",

                "reviewText": "The length of the C-connector cords is long enough for general daily use. However, care must be taken to ensure that the connector to your phone is not pulled accidently as you can see from one of the pictures that the connector is pretty weak, and could easily be pulled apart. While it is a good fit to connect that wire to the charting USB plug in your phone, I am concerned about it easily broken accidently when you use the phone when charging. Otherwise, it is a very fast charging cable. You will just have to use it carefully.",
