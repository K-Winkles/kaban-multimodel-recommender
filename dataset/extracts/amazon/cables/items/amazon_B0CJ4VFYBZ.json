                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the UGREEN Headphone Extension Cable 16 ft (THE 3 FOOT ONE WAS WAYYYY TO SHORT!!!), and I must say it has greatly enhanced my gaming experience with the Nintendo Switch. The cable length is perfect for my setup, providing the flexibility I need without unnecessary slack. I use it with a headset, and the microphone function works seamlessly.While I've encountered a minor inconvenience where I have to replug the cable for my switch to register, I suspect it might be more related to the console's hardware. Nevertheless, the overall performance and durability of the cable are impressive. The length is phenomenal, and the cable's sturdiness gives me confidence in its longevity. Surprisingly, it has avoided the tangling issues that plague many other cords I've used. Overall, a great investment for anyone looking to improve their gaming audio setup.",
