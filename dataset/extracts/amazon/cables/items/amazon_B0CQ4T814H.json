They are sturdy, shielded, braided, flexible, and I have never once had one break (or even seem like it'll break soon) on me, even after having them for years. This one is no exception. It's great for connecting something like a Switch to a portable monitor, for setting up a bigger, 1080p screen, somewhere that you can plug in that doesn't have another easily accessible screen.I have never had a problem with anything I've ordered from JSAUX, and have been consistently ordering every cable I need that they offer for years. I've also been genuinely impressed by their customer service. I would absolutely would recommend any of their products, as they are very high quality, and their customer support is fantastic, kind, responsive, and fast!",
