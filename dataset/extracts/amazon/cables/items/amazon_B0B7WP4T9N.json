                "reviewText": "This amazing cord came well packaged and I was impressed at the quality when opening. It has a velcro snap on it that keeps the cord manageable when not in use and minimizing excess cord when in use.I have android devices and power banks, car lighter plugs and a power inverter I use in the car that this has worked absolutely perfect on. The dual A, C allows a flexible charging configuration.The cable has a braided design which is both protective and flexible. I feel like it won't fray like some cheaper cables I've purchased and tossed in the trash after only a few months of use.The charging speed is FAST and the data transfer even faster if you use it for that. Color me impressed.The right angle C type plug is especially nice to prevent cable bending and also to set devices in holders without fear of ruining the cable near the plug site. This was what I didn't know if I would like, but I really do! This will be a relief not having wear and tear at the plug in site, which is the reason that power cords usually have to be replaced.Having the option to plug into power with either USB-A or USB-C is fantastic, so it won't matter where I need to charge! Once plugged in, it stays plugged in. The right angle C plug (brilliant design) comes in handy in the wall plug too! This cord works well with power strips and wall plugs with USB options also. The USB cord adapters fit easly and can't be lost because they are affixed tightly to the cord. I've had other cords where they weren't attached to or broke off the cord.I'm really satisfied with my purchase of these cords.",

Being able to use these for USB C to C and USB C to A charging, data transfer and printing means less cable to carry with more flexibility.Charing speed is as good as any other cable I have, including the cable that came with my Anker 100 W charger. They work fine for both USB A to C and USB C to C printing with my travel printer. Both A and C work fine for data transfer.These seem to be well made. I have purchased other Ainope cables in the past and none have failed so I see no reason to expect anything different from these.",
