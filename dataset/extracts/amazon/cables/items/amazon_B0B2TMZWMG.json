                "reviewText": "The IVANKY Optical Audio Cable has proven to be a reliable and well-performing addition to my audio setup, enhancing my listening experience significantly. This 10ft/3M slim braided fiber audio cable has impressed me with its sturdy build, crisp audio transmission, and hassle-free usage, earning it a solid four-star rating.The standout feature of this cable is its slim and braided design, which not only adds durability but also prevents tangling and kinks. The braided fiber sheath adds a touch of elegance to the cable, making it not only practical but visually appealing as well. The slim profile ensures that it fits effortlessly into tight spaces, adding to the cable's convenience.The audio transmission quality is exceptional, delivering clear and rich sound without any interference or signal loss. I noticed a significant improvement in audio fidelity when using this optical audio cable compared to standard audio cables. The cable's ability to transmit high-resolution audio signals flawlessly makes it ideal for connecting my home theater system or soundbar to my TV, ensuring an immersive audio experience.The gold-plated connectors offer a secure and reliable connection, preventing corrosion and maintaining optimal signal transfer. This is particularly crucial for uninterrupted audio playback, and the IVANKY cable does an excellent job in this regard.I appreciate the 10ft/3M length of the cable, which provides ample flexibility in positioning my audio devices without the need for extension cords. The length allows me to set up my audio system without constraints, ensuring a clutter-free and organized entertainment area.The cable is compatible with various devices and supports both standard and high-definition audio formats, making it versatile for a wide range of audio setups.The only reason I'm not awarding a full five stars is due to the occasional difficulty in inserting and removing the cable from certain devices. The connectors could have been designed with a more user-friendly grip or labeled for easier identification when connecting multiple cables in a tight space.In conclusion, the IVANKY Optical Audio Cable offers exceptional performance, aesthetics, and durability. Its slim and braided design ensures a tangle-free experience, while the crisp audio transmission enhances the overall listening pleasure. The gold-plated connectors and 10ft/3M length provide reliability and versatility, making it a valuable addition to any audio setup.Despite a minor inconvenience with connector handling, the IVANKY Optical Audio Cable has exceeded my expectations and significantly improved my audio setup. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a high-quality optical audio cable for their home entertainment system or audio devices.",

                "reviewText": "I'm hearing static while using this cord, not sure if it's the cable or my surround sound, using HDMI there is no static, using bluetooth and wifi there is static, using this cord there is FAINT static but it's enough to be distracting. I'm just not positive that it's this cord because the surround sound is some off brand wackadoodle from deepest darkest China. It came with a fiber cord but despite looking similar it absolutely will not fit in anything so I can't test it. It looks the same in all aspects, but won't fit.So I'll leave the review at 5 stars unless I can figure out if it's this cord or not.It looks well made and all, not cheap or nothin'. But looks can be deceiving.",
