Those were prone to dropping out. This greatly simplify things by reducing down to one cable. I've also been using this for a little while and haven't had the drop-outs / disconnects that I had with the combo adapters that I mentioned. Very pleased with this and the construction seems very sturdy so I foresee it lasting me quite a while.",

This cord works great in an older car that has an aux port but not Apple play to play music etc. The aux pigtail and lightening pigtails are an ok length, but where the cord falls short, literally and figuratively, is on the usb pigtail. In our old car the usb port is much farther away than the 6\u201d or so that is given here. So that pigtail is basically useless. Had I realized that I would have just purchased the aux/lightening cord and not bothered with the usb portion. The cord color is great and the quality seems nice.",
