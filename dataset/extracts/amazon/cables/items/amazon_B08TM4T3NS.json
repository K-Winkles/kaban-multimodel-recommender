This cable allows the Wii to output in 480P rather than 480i which makes motion look so much better, since it's sending the entire frame to the tv in 480P, instead of every other line each frame in 480i. For $10, I'd recommend it to all Wii owners!",

                "reviewText": "After doing some research, it came down to either a Mayflash HDMI adapter or a component cable. Luckily, my 2021 model LG flat-screen television still has a component hook-up available. This same television only has two HDMI ports already used by a Nintendo switch and Blu-Ray player. So this was a good option for me to utilize the open component port on the TV. As far as picture and sound quality with this Xahpower Direct component cable, it looks and sounds great. Game play is also much better than the Wii supplied composite cable. Finally, this is a simple one cable hook-up with no additionally adapters and power sources and other things to go bad. And at a price of less than $10/shipped at the time of this writing, a great deal. You could pay more for a composite cable but after seeing the overall quality and performance of this one, don't see a need to pay more. Like I said in the my headline. Get it!",

I can also use with an upscale box but the main issues is no lag is added to the gameplay",
