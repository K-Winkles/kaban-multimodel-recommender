However, when the battery reaches 80%, the phone will enter trickle charge mode (charging protection mode), which means it will charge slower after 80%.JSAUX USB C to Lightning cable supports 30W (Max) of charging power to charge all iPhone and iPad at full speed (Note: Please pair USB-C power adapter above 20W).[Importance] During the fast charging period, some energy will be released when the charged power is converted into stored power, resulting in slight heat. This is under the control of APPLE and is a normal phenomenon, please do not worry. It is recommended not to overuse the phone during fast charging, which will cause the phone to generate more heat.",

                "reviewText": "I initially purchased this cable end of April, and it was working great! Sturdy, easy to use, charges my iPhone 8+ quickly, good length (6ft). A few weeks ago, it stopped working and would only charge if I twisted the cable a certain way. I reached out to customer support and they immediately shipped a replacement cable! Hoping this one lasts longer than a few months, but knowing the warranty is 18 months and the customer service is so great has me at ease. Buy with confidence!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the 10 ft cable in April of 2023. It blew out on me. I purchased another one in July, and this one just blew out on me as well. I'm using an Annker 20 watt charger and this should not be happening. I use JSAUX for all my andriod phones and they work great. But for some reason on my iphone, the cable keeps taking a dump and stops working after a few months.UPDATE:I originally left a one star review based on the blowout. However, the company reached out to me and offered a full refund immediately. Based on that, I upgraded my rating to 4 stars, as previously I have never had a problem with these cables on my andriod. I think it's a great product and the customer service is amazing.Thank you",

It worked great until almost 2 years of service, the item had melted the wires that almost started a fire. It was melting under the braiding from the end being plugged into my devices to about 3-4\u201d. That last few inches started smoking and the melt under the braid took off with smoke. I was lucky to recognize it and quickly unplugged the device and charging cable from the wall. I did get almost 2 years service from it under normal usage but I bought this as the description saying so many charges and usage.",

It\u2019s worked great, charges fast.But be careful not to drop your phone while it\u2019s charging.If you drop it on the cord while it\u2019s plugged in, it will not charge correctly. Like, it\u2019s kind of that annoying thing where you have to angle the cord a certain way in order for it to charge consistently. But this is a personal issue haha don\u2019t do this and it\u2019ll last longer.I\u2019m about to purchase another one after this review for that very reason. \ud83d\ude05So, maybe make sure it\u2019s in a place where the cord won\u2019t be easily caught on something, or knocked over, and you\u2019ll have no issues.I would highly recommend this product.",
