So far, so good.Short of that don't hesitate to buy the 3-pack. Who doesn't love discovering years later 2 extra & wondering what does this go to?I had my fun, it's now serious time. 1st random 1 of 3 out of the box, it's pushing data fast! Don't ask me about the other 2... I'm a happy camper & now you expect me to swap them out just so YOU know all 3 work? If you haven't caught on it's kinda the point of buying 3 low-cost items when you absolutely need at least one to work right dang now. If you've been pootering as long as I have eventually you'll have a box of prehistoric parts. Almost no 1997 PC cable fits anything now, either end. & that's to the positive, trust me. That's when I paid $3500 for a laptop only to have USB released 6 months later. My most expensive doorstop ever. I still have it. The Smithsonian has not called me back.Professionally packaged in a commercial box ready to hang on the wall of any electronics store, don't hesitate.Awesome product, nice price, delivered quick snap. As I type my data transfer is humming along.As for the fancy braided cables versus simple flat cables...Which is it, in your inert PC or dragged behind by your Grandmother's vacuum cleaner?",
