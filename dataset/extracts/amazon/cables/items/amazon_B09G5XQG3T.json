                "reviewText": "Great quality! 6ft long and the 90\u00b0 plug end is really nice feature. Keeps the cord out of the way while holding it in your hand and supports fast and super fast charging. Ordered 4 would definitely reorder if needed!Update- After 6 months of HARD use and the new puppy chewing on one of them, they're hands down some of the nicest and well built charging cords I've ever owned! They handle fast data transfer and fast charge my Samsung s23+ even at the Super fast rate! They go from the house, to the garage, to the truck, and back all the time. Not a single problem! I highly recommend not only these cords but this company and all their cords. They look and feel nice in the hand and are almost bulletproof! For the price point if you don't pick some up, you are making a mistake. I just picked up 3 more cords from this manufacturer for a new car stereo install.",

                "reviewText": "These cables are super! The fact that I got them on sale really cheap is a big bonus. I have only had them a few weeks but I have had zero issues. They charge quickly and I love the right angle connection. Some people complain that the cable it took stuff and although it is stiffer than other cables I've used, it doesn't bother me. They are sufficiently flexible. And unlike the super flexible cables I've bought recently, these have shown no sings of fraying or wearing down at all.",

The connections on both ends of this cord remain tight and reliable.Having the bend in one end of the cord means that you don\u2019t have to worry about wrecking the end of the cord that plugs into your device. With the bend, the cord is safely \u201ctucked\u201d out of the way when the device rests on your lap or any other surface.",
