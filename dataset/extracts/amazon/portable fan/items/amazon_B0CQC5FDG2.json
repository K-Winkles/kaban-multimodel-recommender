You can wrap the feet against the stroller frame, but then it sits right up against your child's face. The arms are not very strong or the fan is too heavy - it will lean over. Do appreciate the three fan speeds - it does a good job moving air and the protective design keeps baby from reaching in and cutting their hands. Like that the arm joins are very malleable, would be better if they were longer. Fan does charge quickly and last for awhile.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This rechargeable detexis portable tripod fan is perfect to use on a stroller. It has 3 tall adjustable legs that allow you to twist the legs around handles and rails and other hard surfaces to keep the fan at a safe distance from the baby or toddler. This is super easy to operate and has 3 speeds (low, medium and high). You simply charge this ahead of use (it arrives already charged) and it will operate for approximately 4-10 hours before needing to be recharged - depending on the speed you use. It comes with a charging cord, but not the charging cube that the cord must be plugged into for charging. This is great to use for babies and toddlers, but can also be used for adults too (e.g., desk fan or a bedside fan). See my video and pictures for details. Thank you for reading my honest and objective review.",
