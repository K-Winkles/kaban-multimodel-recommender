                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I really love this little fan. You can see my video, but the fan has a stand to use on a table which also doubles as a cover for the mirror. There's one simple button to cycle through on/low/med/high/extra high/off. There is a red light to let you know it's charging, a blue light to show when it's in use, and a green light to show it's completely charged.It charges with a USB \"C style\" cord, which is convenient, since that's pretty mainstream now. The cord is included. It comes in a box which I personally think is nice enough to make it giftable. The mirror is a bonus; good for applying face block at an outdoor event for example. I can't tell if the mirror is glass or plastic, but there's no distortion and the quality is excellent, it's not a cheap sticker mirror or anything like that.The size is perfect for putting in a bag or even a backpack for camping, hiking, etc. Also, I'll add that you can leave this plugged into your laptop or PC and use it that way, without draining the battery! It's very versatile. It's also surprisingly powerful.UPDATE: Last night I put this fan on my nightstand on the Low setting and then fell asleep. When I woke up today it was still on to my surprise. So that was 9 hours in addition to a couple more hours that I've been using it at my desk over the last few days and I still haven't had to re-charge it yet. It lasts a long time between charges! Also, I noticed the blue 'on' light goes out after a few minutes of it being on, which is great because this helps the battery life last longer.",

                "reviewText": "I live in Georgia, so having a portable fan on hot days is a great help. I\u2019m an older woman (age 66) and we tend to stay too hot all the time. I\u2019ve used portable neck fans that wrap around your neck and blow on your face the past few years while out walking or gardening, but thought I\u2019d try this one. I got this because it\u2019s rechargeable, small-ish but not tiny, has 4 fan speeds, and has a built-in stand so I can prop it on a tabletop or nightstand if I want some extra breeze. My only complaint is a carrying strap would be handy. I didn\u2019t feel like lugging it around but it fit in my husband\u2019s cargo pants pocket. We attended an air show last weekend. We sat outside in the sun for 4 hours and I was really really glad I had brought the fan. I only used it the last 90 minutes as I was afraid the battery would run out. I didn\u2019t feel much of a breeze outside unless it was running on the highest speed so I wasn\u2019t sure how long the charge would last. It never died, so I still don\u2019t know lol. At the highest speed, there is a faint high pitched whine. Otherwise, it\u2019s very quiet at the lower speeds. The mirror on the handle seems like an odd feature, but why not, I guess. Good use of that space? I can admire my hair blowing in the breeze like a supermodel \ud83d\ude02 Full disclosure. I was asked by a company to try this product, I bought it through Amazon, furnished proof of purchase, then they sent me a gc for the purchase amount. They did not request or require me to write a review. I gave them my feedback directly by email and suggested the carrying strap. That was about two months ago. But then I used it at the air show last weekend and decided I wanted to write a review. I\u2019ve given you my honest opinion and was not compensated to make a positive review or any star rating. I\u2019ll probably still use the neck fans this summer even though they look a little goofy as the hands free feature is great. But this fan has the built-in stand so that presents new ways to use it.",
