I've strapped it to the head rest in the car to help circulate hot air and I use it on the stroller. It doesn't take long to charge. The rechargeable battery makes it so convenient. It has 3 settings and they all have amazing air flow. The battery in mine lasted 3 days being ran none stop. I can also use it while it is charging. The battery will last about 2 weeks depending on how much I use it.",

ALTHOUGH, the legs are not as sturdy as I\u2019d like them to be. I\u2019m pretty rough on my stuff and one of the legs have come off. So if you\u2019re rough on stuff like me, just be gentle with the legs and you shouldn\u2019t have a problem. It fits in just about anything, stroller, car seat, chair, etc. I\u2019d buy it again for sure",

The battery lasts for hours, and I love that I can connect it to my portable charger while we're at the parks and still works. It's perfect for keeping my toddler cool.Not just for Disney, we've been using it at home whenever we need a burst of cool air. It's easy to attach and adjust, and the rechargeable feature is a big plus. The fan's airflow is just right, not too strong. Highly recommended!",
