                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Solid fan! I waited at least a month before reviewing, as other reviewers stated that they had issues with the battery life. I have not, I have been quite impressed with the battery life!I purchased this fan to use on a stationary bike (Schwinn IC4 that I lovingly call my Fauxleton), and it is perfectly up to the task. As a bonus, it has passive charging, so I can keep it charged while using it - it plugs right into the bike with included USB-USB-C cable.I thought the disco lights were fun, and the included scent disc has lasted a long while. I imagine that you can add essential oil drops if you so desire and freshen it up once the scent lowers.10/10 meets my expectations! Would certainly Re-purchase or recommend to a friend. N.B. I DID NOT receive perks for this review, but the company does include a card to give you \u201cVIP membership\u201d in response to reviews - they don\u2019t mention any star rating or otherwise sway reviews, which I liked.",
