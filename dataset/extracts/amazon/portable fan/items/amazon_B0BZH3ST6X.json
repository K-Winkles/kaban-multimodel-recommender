                "reviewText": "I'm hot even when I'm not flashing. I was having my own private summers long before hitting menopause. This quite little wonder is awesome. It's extremely quiet even on the highest speed, is rechargeable, and the charge last for a really long time. So worth it. Excellent price point to boot!! Charging cord included, but wall plug is not. Still so worth it! I ordered two so I'd always have a back up. I don't leave home without one in my purse. The fan is compact, and has a kick stand so you can place it on a table. It doesn't have to be held. Good price point. Awesome fan! She puts out too!!",

                "reviewText": "I got this fan because these hot flashes are killing me. I put it on my nightstand and it gives me a nice breeze as my entire body feels like it\u2019s catching on fire from the inside. It\u2019s really cute (I got the mint green), and it doesn\u2019t make me feel like I\u2019m someone\u2019s grandma over here. The handle has a fold-out stand for hands-free use, so you can chug some ice water. You can also hold it by the handle if you want to dramatically complain about said hot flash. So, practical and fun. It\u2019s rechargeable, so you don\u2019t need to plug it in or use batteries. It has four speeds, and for a small fan, the highest setting is pretty strong! The plastic is sturdy and seems to be of good quality. Overall, a great buy!",

                "reviewText": "Edited update: I see that the fan is now about double the price that I paid for it, so that makes it not a good value to me. I think there are better fans for the money and fans where the strap doesn't break right away.This fan is a good value because of the low price. It is less expensive than others, but works just as well. I actually bought 3 of these in all the colors for my grandkids. They loved having their own fan. However, the ribbon neck strap broke in the first day or two of use, which disappointed my grandkids. I was able to tie it back on, but I shouldn't have had to do that. I think the metal connection severs the ribbon strap with just a little use. Maybe the strap should be made of different material, or the metal connection needs to be different? Other than that we have been happy with the fans. Just this weekend though, I found out that my granddaughter's fan is not wanting to stay on, even though she has it charged. I haven't had a chance to check it out, but if it is not working properly, then that would be a negative for this little fan after only a month of minimal use. I am hoping that maybe she just didn't get it charged right. I will contact the vendor, if it's not working like it should.",

Her school is very old and does not keep heat or cool well. So I purchased this one and she really enjoys it to take to school. With this style she doesn\u2019t have to hokd it up with her hand like mine. She can place it on her desk and not worry about it. She said it is enough to cool her and what is great to is that unlike mine, it is a lot quieter. She likes it and woukd reommend it. It can be handheld but also tabletop.",

As summer approaches, it's growing hot and humid here, and one minute outside, perspiration is streaming down my body.This is a nice small battery-operated portable fan. It has a string on it that I can hang around the neck, so it doesn't have to stay in my hand the entire time. It allows me to get some fresh air on my face or on my body when I require cooling down.The fan has four-speed settings and is simple to turn on and off. It's pink, which is fantastic for me because I adore the color. When used continuously the battery will last around fifteen hours before needing to be replaced. They are ordinary batteries that may be found anywhere.",
