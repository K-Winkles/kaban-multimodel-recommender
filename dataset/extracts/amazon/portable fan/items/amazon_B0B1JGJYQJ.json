                "reviewText": "As someone undergoing hyperbaric chamber therapy, I often found the heat inside the chamber was getting to be quite high. This fan has been a lifesaver in keeping me cool and comfortable during my sessions. Its portable and that means I can easily take it wherever I need, from the therapy sessions to my car.I've found another great use for it - keeping my camera cool during podcast recordings. The fan operates pretty quietly.The battery life is about 7 hours on the highest speed setting (6). The quick charging time is a bonus taking only about 1 hour to fully charge. It has a display that not only tells you the speed but also the amount of battery left. Pretty cool.This fan is lightweight yet feels sturdy and well-constructed. The 180\u00b0 adjustable feature is incredibly useful, allowing me to direct the airflow exactly where I need it whether that's on a table or in my hand.Although I haven't used the power bank capability yet, it's a feature I'm looking forward to trying out. It's always handy to have a backup power source for my devices.",

                "reviewText": "This multifunctional fan offers a host of features that make it stand out in the crowded market of personal cooling devices. The six-speed wind settings provide a customizable cooling experience. I can easily switch between different speeds depending on the temperature and my preferences. The quiet operation is a big plus \u2013 it cools effectively without creating unnecessary noise, making it ideal for use in quiet environments or while working.The built-in 4000mAh battery is a substantial power source. Not only does it provide an extended operating time for the fan, but it also serves as a power bank. This dual functionality is incredibly convenient, ensuring that my devices stay charged when I'm on the go.The foldable design is a space-saving feature, making it easy to carry in my bag or pocket. The neck fan mode is particularly handy for hands-free use, providing a cool breeze without the need to hold it. I highly recommend it for its innovative design and reliable performance.",

                "reviewText": "**UPDATE..... changed to 5 stars, it was user error regarding the lanyard, you have to lay fan on counter and use both hands to hold fan and then push \"pegs\" into the slots. also, battery life is really good (for my use) i only use it for a couple minutes at a time (hot flashes) i charged it to 100% on Saturday evening and its still at 78% on Monday afternoon.color is nice, size is perfect, and surprisingly the air flow is fantastic. i like that it shows you how much battery life there is left and also when charging it shows when at 100%. the only bad thing is the lanyard. it does NOT fit into the slots made to hold it, so its useless. i'm sure i can make my own if needed so not really upset about it since the fan itself is so great",

                "reviewText": "This handheld fan is making my life better! I'm having some fiery hot flashes as a result of some medical treatment. Its awful, lousy and disruptive. But having this 6-speed fan is a game-changer. It's powerful enough to cool me off until they pass and because of that I am so, so, so much more comfortable. It is well-designed, sturdy, feel good in my hand. The battery is very powerful and lasts forever. Ive had it for a week and I've kept it topped off but I didn't need to. For my use, a full battery could last a week or longer, in my estimation. I also love how you can rotate the fan back onto the base and set the fan on a nearby table and let it cool you hands-free. Awesome. I did this during a recent hour-long treadmill run and the cool breeze was a welcome and noticeable improvement (and this only used up about 15% of the battery). Overall I am very grateful to have this and impressed by its design and performance. Recommend!",
