The adjustable speed is nice and the indicator of the battery level. Quick and easy to charge- it does not come with a charge block, just the cable. I haven\u2019t used it to wrap around anything (stroller, bed rail, etc) but I have used it almost as a tripod style and it worked nicely! Perfect for the price too!",

                "reviewText": "Update: I had another chance to try out this fan because apparently the first one I got was defective. This one works much better it blows air better and while it still falls over on high speeds it doesn't fall over when it's fully charged. The seller was quick with their response and offered great service as well. After trying this fan again (the replacement) I will definitely purchase it again ,as well as newer versions from the seller. The fact that it shows the battery percentage is awesome and I learned so important (I had another product I purchased overheat from charging and nearly explode) so it definitely provides peace of mind that it won't be overcharged because I can actually See the percentage of battery left. Lightweight easy to carry and operates quietly perfect for sleeping and work environments (to have at your desk)~~TLDR: The first one I bought didn't work well after getting in touch with the seller I was able to get a new one that works way better. So I can now recommend this product over the GetBreeze because the GetBreeze fan doesn't have a Battery percentage display which puts it at risk of being overcharged overheating and exploding. This one is more reliable to take with you and you know exactly when it's charged. Its lightweight moves cools well and it has low enough noise to not disturb people or sleeping babies. Highly recommend for that.I purchased another version of this type of fan, if it wasn't for that this would have easily gotten four stars. However the fact that I could compare the two and had the other one first made my expectations too high for this one.So first I love that this one tells you how much of a charge it has with the led screen really amazing feature that will definitely be missed. That's the only good thing I can say about this fan because I don't know if mine was defective or not but it will NOT stand up on it's own you can't sit it anywhere without the legs. Which was a deal breaker for me so I knew it was a instant return. The other one I purchased on here stands up on its own and even has a little hook ring at the bottom to help stabilize it. Unfortunately the other one is more effective at blowing air as well.Comparing the two the other one (GetBreeze) or GetBreezy wins by a landslide. I wish it had the feature of the led charge screen though. That's the only advantage this one has over the GetBreeze. The GetBreeze battery last longer. And it's more powerful yet slightly smaller. Also it stands on its own with or without legs. The Sweetful(l) just falls over at least mine does. Anyway it was a gift for my aunt and I no longer have it. Would've returned anyway because it falls over everywhere.",

I work indoors and there is AC but sometimes if I'm running around a lot I still get hot, so I like having this for some extra airflow. It works so well, and the flexible legs are so handy for hanging it or standing it up. I realized this would be amazing for camping too, which I do from time to time. The power level readout is very handy. It's so nice seeing how much power I have left. That being said, I have run it off and on for a days at a time and haven't had to recharge. If you were running it constantly I'm sure the battery would deplete faster. but I feel like this could run overnight on a low level and be fine. It's so handy to have, I feel like it would be perfect for tent camping or for vanlife. You can mount it just about anywhere to get some air blowing on you. Plus it comes in cute colors, which for someone like me who loves cute things, is an incredible bonus.",

I bought this item for my daughter because she was going to a baseball tournament and it was going to one over 100 degrees. The fan worked nicely but needed to be charged constantly. During the summer she would use it in her bed but could not get it to stay without falling over so she had to hold it. Some pros about the item though is that it has different modes of intensity based on how fast you want the wind coming which is nice. it is also portable which was very helpful in my case. Over all a nice product, could be tweaked a little but very nice.",
