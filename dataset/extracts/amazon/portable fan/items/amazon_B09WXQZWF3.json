It provides a great air flow and the charge lasts a long time. Used it at a high school football game-it was HOT in those stands and it made the heat tolerable. Love it!",

I charged the light turned from red to green after charging and everything but it will not turn in anymore!!!! And we I looked to see if I could return it my date had passed. I actually liked this fan the few times I used. Debating if I want to purchase another in hopes that it will not stop working after 3 uses!!!",

                "reviewText": "UPDATES April 5, 2023I upped the rating to 4-Stars, my fan that I thought DID NOT have a charging indicator, actually does. I decided after using the fan for a while to see how well it would hold up in the Florida heat, that it works very well, so I opted to take it apart to do a bit of a deep cleaning of the entire unit and I did find it has a charging LED that is red on charging and green on fully charged. And this is why I didn't know it had any such thing on mine, once I opened the case up, I found that the hole the LED is supposed to shine through was not reamed out, apparently this wasn't caught in final inspection. I took an X-Acto knife and I cut away the thin plastic where the indicator light should have been shining through, cleaned up all the plastic shavings, and put the fan back together again. Now when I charge my fan I can actually see the RED light showing it's on charge, and will turn green when fully charged. The plastic flashing just wasn't cut away, and the plastic being black, well, it blocked the LED light from passing through and being seen. It's an easy fix to do, so if your fan isn't showing the LED indicator during charging and when fully chrged, it's probably due to the same thing that was wrong with mine. The indicator WAS working, I just couldn't see it. The indicator is right next to the charging port, so be very careful if you have to ream out the LED indicator hole to see it.Battery run time has been awesome, I can fully charge mine and get 2 to 3 days use out of it, using it for about 4-5 hours run time (+ or - 1-hour) a day before needing to recharge it again. So a good, full charge should last you several days depending on your usage.================================= END UPDATE 04/05/2023 =============================DISLIKES:#1. NO INSTRUCTION MANUAL to explain all the fan's features, charging time need to full capacity power.#2. NO power on, charging or fully charged indicator.#3. It WILL NOT set on desktop or table by itself without using something on either side to hold it in place or strong double-sided tape to hold it in place. However, if the supplied USB charging cable is powering the fan as it charges, if the USB cable is coiled near the fan and touching the table, then the fan will stand on a desk as the USB Charging cable helps to balance it. No cable = No balance = WILL NOT STAND ON ITS OWN!.#4. The power button to control the fan when on a table is located at the bottom, so you have to pick up the fan to change speeds or turn it off/on, which makes it inconvenient to use as a table-top/desk-top fan.#5. The lanyard should have been pre-installed, as it is a royal in the backside to get it on the fan.LIKES:#1. The size of the fan is nice, it's larger than most fans of this caliber.#2. Fan output is very good, I was surprised at how much wind output it has on level 3, level 2 isn't too shabby, although level 1 is okay, but in hot climates like where I live in Florida level 3 works out the best for keeping you cool.I was really shocked that I compared Level 3 output on the Faraday portable fan against my electric tabletop fan, also with 3 levels, my tabletop fan on Level 3 was more like Level 1 on this portable hand-held fan, so that was a huge surprise.Because of not getting any type of instruction manual and the other dislikes against this fan, I could not give it more than a 3-Star rating, and 2-Stars on noise level, as in a quiet environment this fan could be annoying to others around you. Normal or High noise level use would be appropriate, but the noise level is far too loud in quiet surroundings.I could not rate the battery time, as I just got our fans, I bought 2 at the same time, one for myself and one for my wife., so I have no idea how long the battery will hold up in use when the fan is not on a charging station before a recharge is needed.There is one thing I've seen some users of this fan say, that their fan's Level 3 stopped working, on most of these portable rechargeable hand-held fans I have noticed that as the battery power drops, certain speeds will no longer function, that is an indicator your fan need to be recharged. Level 3, requiring the most power is always the first to stop functioning, then as the power drains further, level 2 will stop working until eventually the fan will not have enough power to turn on at all {Level 1}. Usually a recharge will have your fan working back to normal again with all levels working. I have owned a variety of these fan's and I haven't encountered any that does not do this as the battery power gets lower and lower.Others have complained about broken USB charging cables, well you can find these type cables at local retail stores such as your favorite anything for $1 type store, although the cables at those dollar item stores are usually poor quality. Better off buying them locally or ones found at other retailers, as most are of a higher quality.",
