I was not disappointed; this one has worked out great. First off, very easy to use. One button powers on the off, and then each additional press changes the speeds, it has three speeds, and then off. It also has an easy-to-find USB cable connector on the side too. Secondly, it works great. I like how the fan puts out a good amount of air on low and then really puts out the air on medium and high. In addition to the high airflow, the sound level is low, and my girl is so happy about that because she does not want to distract others when using it. Lastly, I like how it stays charged for a long time and hours, and my girl has not run out of use with it. She basically plugs it in when she gets home, and it is always charged for use. No cons, it really worked out great for us, and I am very happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I made a recent purchase of this compact personal fan, and it has quickly become one of the most important things in my bag. Permit me to share some of my honest experiences and opinions with regard to this incredible piece of equipment. To begin, the fact that this portable fan can be moved from place to place is a major advantage. Because it is not only small but also lightweight, it is very simple for me to transport it wherever I go. This fan is easy to pack away in either my backpack or even my pocket, so I can take it with me everywhere I go, whether I'm strolling in the woods, discovering a lively city, or unwinding on the beach. The innovative addition of the lanyard enables me to hang the item from either my bag or my wrist so that I can reach it easily at any time. The fact that the battery can be recharged is a huge benefit for me. I can use the fan for many hours on a single charge, making it an ideal accessory for day excursions and other activities that take place outside. Recharging the fan from a power bank, laptop, or any other USB port is made simple by the inclusion of a USB charging cable in the package. Because of this, I don't have to worry about regularly changing the batteries; therefore, selecting this option is good for the environment. This portable fan is quite convenient, and I like that it has three different speed settings. The settings on the fan may be adjusted to meet my requirements for a little breeze, moderate airflow, or stronger airflow so that I can feel more comfortable. The high-speed option is great for providing rapid relief on very warm days, while the low-speed setting is ideal for preserving battery life on extended car rides. The operation of the fan is quite quiet, which ensures that it will not disrupt the peace and quiet of the locations that I frequent.",

This fan easily charges with my phone charger and that it doesn't come with them be cause it dies but in case I ever lose the charge. I also have an extra spare which is nice. It has different levels, so you don't have to choose it on the highest level. You can choose medium or low so that way. It's not so high in their face, but if they're older, they can obviously choose their own levels without issues",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m happy with the product, it is strong once you get to level 3; but not strong enough to be annoying. Also it\u2019s nice to cool me down during this heat wave in my state that is not usually this hot, and though I\u2019m used to it; they\u2019re are times I needed to cool down a bit. This helps a lot, especially since in my house we don\u2019t exactly have a a/c or central heating n cooling; and this is my only way to cool down (aside from drinking water and staying hydrated). I highly recommend this product, and it\u2019s convenient for everywhere you go; because it is small enough to fit in a big. Definitely worth the price, but definitely try to get it when there is a sale or discount; and if you can use a bit of your points to make it cheaper. I love it so much!!",
