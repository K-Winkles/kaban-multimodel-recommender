                "reviewText": "Small, sleek, attractive, versatile, and powerful. What a fantastic handy little fan this is!I admittedly was expecting this to be slightly larger than it is, I was surprised when the package arrived and it was in a smaller box than expected. That said, I'm super happy about the size after using it, because the light weight allows the clamp to work extremely well and the fan is still quite a bit more powerful than you would expect from the size. You can feel the fan from a good 10 feet away when on high! As mentioned above the fan is extremely sturdy when clamped, no matter the tilt or angle.The fan can rotate a full 360\u2070 and can also tilt fully around, letting you aim it in every direction. With that positioning flexibility plus how you can use this clamped, standing on its own on a flat surface, or hanging by the foldaway hook on the bottom, the combination makes this smal fan extremely versatile. The battery lasts a good long time, I have not timed it but I have gotten hours of use out of it over the course of multiple days at various power settings without losing power. The LED display on the front center clearly shows the percentage of battery remaining.There is nothing to not like here. It's a great fan that does everything it's supposed to and does it all very well. Plus it really just looks nice! Love this fan.",

                "reviewText": "This TUNISE Clip-On FAN is far superior to my old fan; my old one doesn't have a rechargeable battery, nor does it have a clip to increase usefulness.I was a bit worried that this new fan would not be able to be pointed in the direction that I needed it to be pointed if it were clipped on something at certain angles. I was very pleased when I opened the box and checked over this new fan to find that the fan swivels 360 degrees on both its X & Y axis. This gives the ability to point in any direction, regardless of how the clip is used.The Fan's speed and battery level are clearly indicated on the display in the center of the fan.Overall, this is the perfect fan for my desk at work and it easily fits into laptop backpack. It also goes to meetings with me, especially for the meeting rooms that are always too hot. Its perfect for my needs and its a good value.My Rating System:5-Stars - A Superior Product or Above Average & An Excellent Value - I would recommend.4-Stars - Above Average OR Excellent Value \u2013 A great choice.3-Stars - Average \u2013 What one might generally expect.2-Stars - Below Average Product OR Poor Quality Control \u2013 Maybe seek an alternative.1-Stars - Avoid if at all possible.",

You can also just place it on a desk or tabletop if you want. I'm not sure any of these mini fans are whisper quiet, but this one's quieter than others I've gotten in the same genre.Battery life is ok. Probably a few hours off one charge, but you can run it off USB power while using it too. The only thing I don't like is it has a \"screen\" in the center that tells you the battery life percentage. It's on all the time and can't be turned off. While it's nice to be able to see what you have left, I don't find it pleasant to look at all the time.",

                "reviewText": "I wouldn't call this fan \"super strong\" but it does put out a decent amount of air for its size. Comparable to other portable fans of its size, it isn't anything special in that regard. The battery life is pretty nice, lasting for hours upon hours. You'd think the screen showing battery life would accurately reflect that, but mine got stuck on 41% for quite a long time. Whatever, I think of it more as an estimate anyway. I really like the number of mounting options this fan offers. You can stand it upright by itself, clip it to something, or there's a folding D-ring on the bottom which you can hang it from something. Very convenient! You can swivel the fan on 2 axis, which is also very convenient for reaching just the right angle. Overall I really like this fan, and it is very affordable & competitively priced (at time of review). Would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This fan does a good job for its size. I like that it has the battery life percentage in a clear display on the front of the fan. After 5 hours of continuous use on low setting, the fully charged battery was completely depleted. It took about 4 hours to charge from 0 to 100 percent.It's small and convenient to move from on location to another. I like that it's not tethered by a dedicated cord while in use. It feels durable and well made. I rate this at 5 stars for quality, convenience, value and durability. A good value for how it performs.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great little portable fan, a good mix of powerful-enough, lower noise and good battery life. For a l lot of small portable fans the only speed worth using is the highest speed, but for this fan on my desk my preference is the lowest setting. I can feel the breeze and it's very quiet. On the highest setting it's quite strong but pretty loud as well, and really sucks down the battery.The battery charge percentage is a really nice feature. The clip is pretty good -- it's padded and surprisingly strong but only opens about an inch, so the things it can clip to are limited.For those times when you don't need full blown plug-in fan this is definitely a nice step-up from a typical cheap handheld or desk fan.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m pretty impressed with this fan! It has three levels or three speeds, and really can get a lot of air out. I also really like the clip because there\u2019s foam on the inside, so it doesn\u2019t scratch the things that I clip it onto.By one complaint, is that I find it unnerving that the battery level is permanently displayed in the middle of the fan using a digital display. It\u2019s helpful I guess, I just wish there was a way to turn it off when I don\u2019t want to be distracted by it. I\u2019m not annoyed by it enough to takeoff a star for this, because it does impede its functionality, I just wish there was a way to turn it off.Overall, this is a great fan and I definitely recommend",
