                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I love this fan, it moves plenty of air to keep a breeze going across my face and neck for hours at year sales. I was concerned about all the bad reviews and why people gave it such low mark and so I examined it closely and think I found the reason. The top of the legs are connected to the body in a way that allows movement in only 1 direction, the legs themselves can be moves in a 360 degree arc but if you grab the leg and pull it to the side putting pressure on the top of the leg it very well might break off, solution? Grab the top of the leg and hold it while you are adjusting it and you will never have a broken leg problem. Just looking at it will tell you that it can only move 1 direction. This is a fan in the $25 dollar range so it is not indestructible but it is a great value, it gives great performance for a rechargeable fan and with a little common sense it will last a long time. It gets 5 Stars from me but it does require a bit of common sense from the operator.",

If I had the space I would have bought 4 of these. Very lightweight, easily attached, flexible legs, powerful fan and Bluetooth too! I set it up as a phone stand for the kids while they waited for food, cooled everyone off all day long and charged it end of day. We used it off and on daily not continuously. Now I use it in my girls room when it\u2019s stuffy and set a timer if needed. It has speed controls too. It\u2019s a great product 100% recommend to every parent or anyone needing a portable fan.",

I have fully charged it and it will no longer turn on. I noticed it would start glitching a week ago - we would turn it off and the blades would still spin. We had to manually stop the blades.Edit to add: The company has reached out and provided a replacement. The replacement seems to be working as expected, for now. It seems more powerful than the one we originally had too",

                "reviewText": "We live in CA and our summers are HOT! I ordered this fan a little over a year ago to attach to my sons stroller/back of headrest in car to keep him cool when we\u2019re on the go. We put it away for the winter months and when I brought it back out it wouldn\u2019t turn on unless it was plugged into the charger. Because we use it when we\u2019re on the go, there was no way to keep it on the charger while using it so I emailed the company and they sent me a new one at no cost! Mind you, I was a a week or two past the year date of purchase so I was worried about it no longer being under warranty. The customer service was quick and to the point! Very happy with this company.When we received the new fan in the mail, I was happy to see that they made a few minor changes that overall make the fan even more powerful and user friendly. Highly recommend!",
