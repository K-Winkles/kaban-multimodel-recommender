                "reviewText": "I have other fans in the house I use when my electric power is on; however it is Summer now and with it comes the dreaded power outages that Summer brings with it.With this in mind I ordered this fan to have a bit of comfort from the heat for when the lights are out.I'm really impressed with this little guy. How did EasyAcc manage to squeeze such a good strong wind breeze plus such a long runtime into this fan? Beats the heck out of me; I just know it works.I wish I would have had this fan last year; and the year before that; and the year before that; and for many years before that.When I'm holding this fan and looking at how it's made it really looks to be a high quality item; not cheap or flimsy in any way. It feels solidly built and I am looking forward to a long service life from it.Like I say I bought it for emergencies when the power is out so I don't use it a lot, or even every day. But that's not to say you can't use it every day. I have no doubt it would stand up to daily use.There are other fans on Amazon similar to this fan but I chose this fan specifically because IT IS an EasyAcc product.EasyAcc is not a fly-by-night brand name. They make top quality products; especially their line of lithium ion battery powerbanks, of which I own several. (All bought and payed for by me.)I bought myself some peace of mind for this Summer's heat when I bought this fan. Power outages will be more tolerable for me now this Summer. I'm glad I bought it.",

                "reviewText": "This was a long-lasting and surprisingly effective fan while it worked, but the charging was always temperamental. It was tricky plugging in the micro-USB charger and the charging light wouldn't always come on. Now, it doesn't charge at all, and so the fan is not useful. Unfortunately, this happened only days after the return period closed, so we have a non-functional fan. Highly recommend their desk fan, also operates via USB but hard-wired into the fan and no battery, only runs when plugged in. The portable fan, give it a miss if you expect it to last longer than 30 days.UPDATE -- I changed the rating from two to four stars as the company was responsive. Even though the product was beyond the return window, EasyAcc sent me a new replacement. It has been working fine for the past week and has a remarkable run time -- thank you to a customer-service-minded company that stands behind its products!",
