                "reviewText": "I bought this in the heat wave thinking I could put it up in the A/C duct register to help pull some of the cold air into the room, and it fit like a charm. It's super thin, so it fit between the register and the duct work. It's just the right size to fit in the 7x9 space that is there. It would be nice if it had a more analog power switch, because I'm afraid of unplugging it and having the battery drain and then have to take the register back down to access it and turn in back on. (I guess I could poke it with a screwdriver or something if I had to, and honestly it wasn't that hard to put in there.) The fan moves quite a bit of air to help pull the cold out of the A/C unit, meaning that there is a noticeable difference between the vent with the fan and the other vents in the house. It's a whisper silent fan, hardly noticeable sound from it on the highest setting. I think I'm going to order a few more of these to put in the rest of the duct vents, and heck, they're nice little fans to have around in case of a power outage or any other reason you might want a battery powered fan.",

I can usually just use it on low while watching tv and such to feel comfortable. Sometimes I have to crank it up on the highest setting, but after a couple minutes I turn it back down.On the lowest setting it is very quiet. It\u2019s a tad noisy on the highest setting, but what fan isn\u2019t?!It seems to charge quickly, and it holds a charge and can run for quite a lot time. You can also use it while it is plugged in. I like that it can be toted around with me, without having to find an outlet for it.My son and husband liked it so much that we bought a second one, they like to take them camping with them and use them in our canvas tent when it gets too warm inside.Obviously I would purchase again, because I already did. I would recommend this to anybody needing a good quality, portable, personal sized fan.",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased many desktop fans over the years, and this Jostry Mini Desk Fan is by far the best. It can be angled for comfort, is easy to carry with the open handle, and has three speeds (low, medium or high). Best of all, the battery life is amazing!I am a \"hot sleeper\", so in addition to keeping the air conditioning on at night all year long, even when it is snowing outside, I have been using a tower fan with a remote control in the corner of the bedroom. I have owned this little fan for a month now, and instead of the tower fan, I have been moving it every night from my home office desk to my nightstand in the bedroom. I can angle it toward my pillow, and I have been sleeping better than ever. It has been so reliable and lasts all night with battery power to spare that I just ordered a second one -- this time in white -- so I don't need to keep moving the one I have.For such a low cost, this is an exceptional product and will make a great gift. I highly recommend it.",
