                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Strong airflow, great for power outages",
                "reviewText": "A power outage in the height of Texas summer is just about the worst thing that can happen. During one that lasted several hours, I ended up driving across town and taking my elderly dog shopping, just to get her inside somewhere that had a/c. More recently, we've had some short power outages, lasting maybe an hour each. Still, that's enough time for my apartment to go from slightly-warmer-than-I'd-like to my-living-room-is-a-burning-hell. Looking for a back-up plan, I decided to see if battery operated fans were even a thing, and that's when I found this O2Cool fan. I was a little nervous about buying it, since a few reviewers said theirs didn't work or didn't last, but a few reviews from hurricane areas had me wanting to give it a try. So I ordered one and crossed my fingers.TL;DR: Awesome fan, works great!First off, I like the size and design. This isn't one of those tiny palm-sized USB fans; it's about a foot wide in total, with a 10\" span inside for the actual fan blades. It's slightly taller than it is wide, but it's depth is pretty compact. The vented cover is sized just right for me to not accidentally slip a finger inside when I pick it up, though it does have a carrying handle if you want to play it really safe. It does come with an A/C adapter, which I guess is nice, but I don't really need. Then again, it may come in handy if one of my two regular fans goes out and I need a temporary replacement.It's kind of a battery hog in that it needs 6 D-batteries to run, but honestly, I think that's a good thing. Any less, and it'd be a much smaller, weaker fan that wouldn't last any time at all. I haven't had occasion to run it for hours and hours and hours, but according to other customers, it lasts 9+ hours on high and even longer on low. I think that will be plenty to get me through the next power outage. And about those low and high speeds... This thing has great air flow. I wouldn't want to set it up 10 feet away from me, but since it's not tied to a cord or outlet, that won't be a problem. On low speed, there's plenty of air flow, and on high speed, it's awesome. It's slightly less powerful than the 22\" corded turbo fans I use on a daily basis.All in all, I'd say this is an awesome buy. I was impressed enough with the first one that I immediately ordered a second, and both work very well with both the A/C adapter and batteries. I'm stocked up on D batteries now, too, so it looks like I'm set to ride out the next power outage in comfort!Update 12/1/2108: I bought two of these fans to get me through a power outage, which hasn't happened yet. But a few weeks ago, my apartment's a/c went out in the middle of the night, and the two fans I brought into the bedroom just weren't enough. I ended up grabbing one of these battery operated fans, intending to use the included A/C cord, and set it up on my nightstand. But in my sleepy, overheated stupor, I turned it on and quickly fell asleep -- forgetting to plug it in. Six hours later, I woke up and called maintenance, and they had my a/c fixed fast. Then I went to unplug and put away this fan, only to realize I'd left it running on high for 6 hours on nothing but battery power! So yes, I can now say without a doubt that these little fans run great for at least several hours.Update: Here I am. Power outage. Texas. Summer. While my neighbors sit in their doorways trying to catch a weak breeze, my dog and I are comfortably lounging on the sofa, a fan trained on each of us, while she sleeps and I read my Kindle. This is EXACTLY the scenario I wanted to be prepared for, and these fans are everything I'd hoped for!",

It's the perfect size to set on the edge of the dresser, and just loud enough on the high setting. It also moves a surprising amount of air for being so lightweight. Good price point and much better than the fan app on my phone!",

                "reviewText": "What a great find. We had a devastating 100 mph storm last week which crippled the city. On day 3 of 90\u00b0+ temps and no power I finally looked on Amazon for something that might help. (We are now at day 6 and the fans are truly fantastic.)These fans. They are everything to me right now. They take 6 D size batteries so prepare for that. But over 24 hours of constant use \u2026 invaluable.They\u2019re 10 inches and slender, lightweight, easy to put anywhere from a window ledge to high perch.Well made, they have permanent screws for the battery cover so you don\u2019t lose them. Brilliant!These fans come with a wall adapter for when there is power.As for the effectiveness of them, I can say they are powerful enough to place across the room by 5 feet or so and still feel a breeze. I think this is described as a desk fan but it can be used for so much more.These things are life savers! I\u2019m buying a third one today!",

                "reviewText": "It's a pretty good little fan, and I've got no complaints for the $20 price. A very necessary item for camping or hiking during hot and humid summer days, when you can't always count on a breeze when you want it. Also makes a rather quiet and conveniently sized fan around your home, car, or office (I've often been annoyed that 120V box fans are so loud, even on their LOW setting). And an important bit of emergency preparedness, providing just a little bit of airflow and cooling in event of grid power failing during hot summer days (hope you've got LOTS of fully-charged D batteries lying around, or a spare car battery!).On LOW it's pretty quiet, about as loud as a ceiling fan (UPDATE: after two years of light use, the motor has become significantly noisier, much like a card in bicycle spokes). If you're sensitive to noise, it might bother you just a little bit trying to sleep in-front of it. But when you really need it, you probably won't complain...My only objection is the two screws you have to lighten/loosen to change the batteries. A bit of hassle, that could have been avoided. I wish they had used some other method to hold the batteries securely that didn't require the extra time and tools.I am happy to see that the AC adapter is 12V (which is very common), even though the 6xD batteries will only provide about half that, requiring more circuitry within the fan. It runs noticeably faster and louder on 12V than on batteries, but nothing dramatic. I also love that the outlet/receptacle on the fan accepts BOTH of the two most common type of DC barrel plugs, making a good connection with either, so a couple of car/cig adapters I've already got laying around work just perfectly with this fan.Specs on AC/DC wall-wart:Switching AdapterMODEL:SUN-1200070INPUT:100-240V~ 50/60Hz 0.05AOUTPUT:12V --- 0.7A (positive center polarity)Measured power consumption:LOW: 5WHIGH: 9WPF: .51The electronics near the plug (presumably the voltage regulator) gets noticeably warm during operation on wall or car power (but not on battery power). But after a several hours, it still seems to be staying only just slightly warm, so no worries, but it might have been a bit more efficient with a different design.UPDATE: Be careful about ordering this fan. From several user comments, it sounds like the fan might have been significantly redesigned recently, OR perhaps one (or more) of the sellers here could be passing off a different and wrong product. Be aware.",

Also it is very difficult to close the battery compartment.I was shocked about the difficulty with cleaning. You have to remove about eight screws with a specialty screwdriver... long handled.Overall ok with it... would I buy again. No... It a little cheaply made for my taste.",

Used it twice when power cut out and it was a 43\u201dC day, worth the wait in having it shipped from America, subsequently bought another for myself and one each for relatives. Makes so much sense having this as a backup cooling system. Fantastic brand, sturdy and affordable. Totally recommend.",
