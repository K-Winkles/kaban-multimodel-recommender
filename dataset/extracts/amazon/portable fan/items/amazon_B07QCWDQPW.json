It worked for several hours on one charge and it also works while it\u2019s plugged in. It gives off a lot of air and it was so convenient that it adjusted to varying heights. It worked great for my husband and I for our trip especially since it seems like the hotels would turn off the AC in the middle of the night. The only complaint I have is that the remote doesn\u2019t seem to work. Also, if I had to do it again I would buy the fan that oscillates. Otherwise, I\u2019m extremely happy with this fan and would definitely recommend it!",

It only worked a few times. So I bought another one and the same exact thing happened. I\u2019m going to try to find something on the internet to help me figure out what could be wrong and reach out to their customer service. So I\u2019ve invested ~$130 and one was awesome.",

So far the charge only lasts a few hours, but if you keep the charger in overnight it works just fine! I would 100% buy this again and recommend to anyone. It can be used in so many different ways and is compact. Great Product!",

Batteries are the kind that cannot be changed out, so now I have $80 tied up in 2 fans that will not work. I actually always had them plugged in so they would not have to run off the batteries. They need to fix this problem. I have read other reviews where people experience the same problem. I wonder how many of the 5 stars have just not come back to complain but have this issue now. They actually lasted only about 2 months. The first one I did not live where it was kept so not a lot of use then. The new one has been for just under 2 months. I have plug in fans I have had for 15 years, still going strong. This is not acceptable.I have 2 of these now. I liked the first one so much, and I did not want to keep taking it upstairs and downstairs, even though every light weight. It is quiet, almost blows cold air, takes up little space, convenient, folds down small and away for the winter when not needed instead of traditional bulky fans. Not good for open spaces, but to have right in front of you when you are sitting, sleeping, or on a computer, so don't expect it to do areas like the big bulky fans. It is your close up personal fan.",
