It doesn\u2019t take up to much room in my bag and even if I over pack I will remove stuff to make it fit. It\u2019s nice that a lot of places now have the usb charging in the night stand lights and that\u2019s how the fan charges. You can still use a wall charger to charge it but the cord is a bit short. It\u2019s not a big deal though since it\u2019s only used at night and I can charge it during the day if need be. The charge lasts all night and half the next day. I love it and don\u2019t leave home without it.",
