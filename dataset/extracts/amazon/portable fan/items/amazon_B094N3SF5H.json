                "reviewText": "I bought this neckfan for my husband because we live in Alabama (super hot and humid from spring through fall) and he works in a manufacturing plant that has no a/c. He comes home everyday with his clothing soaking wet from sweat so I wanted to get something that could help keep him somewhat cool. He has loved having this thing. He works 8-10 hour shifts and if he keeps it on medium fan, it will last the whole shift or about 4 to 5 hours on high setting. He usually does keep it on high cause it's just so hot in there that he needs it to be on high to keep cool so he typically waits until mid-morning to turn it on and it will last from about 9 a.m. to 1:30-2:00 p.m. on high/full blast. He still comes home hot and sweaty but he said it absolutely makes a big difference and he's so happy I bought it for him. It isn't too loud, it's so lightweight he forgets he's wearing it most of the time, and the fans are protected/enclosed so it won't catch your hair or anything. Highly, highly recommend! I'm going to purchase a 2nd fan soon cause we'll be starting little league football and I'm gonna need it to make it through games and practices. lol",

                "reviewText": "I have a medical condition that doesn't allow me to be out in the heat for extended lengths of time. I decided to get these neck fans for the times I am out. I bought these because of the positive reviews and for the fact that the fan units don't appear to appear to extend far out away from your neck like some others do. I thought those might get in my way when leaning over to examine things. Delivered quickly. They did fit comfortably around my size 16 1/2 neck and they were partially charged when I received them. Put them on and pushed the button. Since I was indoors, they blew cool air all around my neck. Some went on my chin and up a little on my face and around the back of my neck. Felt great! That was the low setting. The medium and high settings blew more volume but not higher up on my face or neck. The low setting isn't loud at all, you can barely hear it. It gets louder each time you increase the fan speed but it's not uncomfortable. Still, they did seem to cool me. Outside, they blow whatever temperature the ambient air is. They do cool your neck because as they blow across your skin that is moistened by sweat, the sweat evaporates, thereby cooling you. Kind of like the \"swamp cooler\" effect. One thing, though, the air outlets around the neck fan are on the inner, upper edge, angled upward toward your neck. If you're like me, overweight and have a neck roll, the roll will block the outlets if you raise you head or lean it left or right. I guess because this is a smaller unit.They are very light and pretty unobtrusive. The fans units are closer to my neck and do touch my chin when I look down at my feet but the fans don't get blocked. I've used them 4-5 times for about an hour each time and they are still on the original charge. ( I fully charged them shortly after trying them on). Overall, I probably should have tried one of the larger neck fans, but this seems to keep my neck and lower part of my head cool for the times I'm outside. If it really humid, hot and sunny you can still get overheated from direct sun exposure, so be careful!.",

This neck fan helps keep me cool when I'm outside in the heat. It make a noticeable difference! I like this better than the cooling towels as they are wet and don't stay cool. I also like the three settings so I can personalize the amount of airflow I need to feel cooler. It's quiet and really works well. So happy that I got it!",

This one has a much better battery life and you can actually see the battery percentage on the side. It has multiple levels to the fan and level 1 was similar to the max level on my last neck fan. This fan is great and we use it all the time when on walks down here in S. FL.",

                "reviewText": "Yes this does produce a great breeze if you are not being active. Once you start to sweat the air turns tepid. About 30 minutes into Mowing or a hike the cool breeze is not refreshing. It is a little loud when on high but not bad if you turn up your headphones. It does vibrate annoyingly when it hits your headphones when you jog. Overall I prefer my evaporation neck towel to the neck fan. Battery life is good lasts well over my 60 minute hikes. Recharge is very slow.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly I give this a 10 out of 10! For the money I wasn't expecting it to be great but it deff exceeded my expectations. I work in a hot warehouse 10 hours a day in 90 to 100 degree Temps in the summer. This fan is a must have. It's light weight on your neck, you barley hear it bc it's super quiet, and the fan is pretty strong for as small as it is. It lasts about 7 hours on low and probably about 5 on high I'd say I've never really kept it on high bc you don't really need to but I highly recommend it of you need something portable to cool you off. And they even include the type c charger, it's not super long tho so what I did was went and bought a longer one and plugged it into my battery pack, slipped the battery in my pocket and wore it while it was charging so it lasted longer. So if your sonine who needs it for a long time that deff works too!Happy shopping \ud83d\ude03",
