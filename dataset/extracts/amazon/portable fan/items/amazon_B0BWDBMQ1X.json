                "reviewText": "As it\u2019s a usb fan I had very low expectations, but the power on this thing is actually good! I can feel a current of air even when standing a few feet away. I\u2019ve used other desktop usb fans but this is the first that actually FEELS like a fan. Most just give off an insulting whisper of a breeze, but this guy actually cools. It\u2019s winter where I\u2019m at so my workplace only gets so hot, but I\u2019m looking forward to this fan keeping me sane in the summer. The color selection is fun, decent size. Build is plastic, but so long as you don\u2019t chuck it across the room I don\u2019t see it easily coming apart. For the price you really can\u2019t go wrong.",

                "reviewText": "I wish I had bought this at the beginning of summer! Since this summer has been record high temperatures we didn\u2019t want to overwork our AC. My bedroom was so hot, plus I was also having hot flashes/night sweats. I chose this fan specifically for the price and the good reviews. I\u2019ve had it for several weeks now and it has been awesome. It\u2019s just the perfect size for my bedtray. It\u2019s easy to operate and I am impressed with the speed settings as it gets pretty strong on the 3rd setting. It\u2019s light, portable and it\u2019s really quiet even on the last setting.My only issue with it is the cord being attached to the fan itself. I would\u2019ve rather used a mini usb to usb cable for the length I needed which I have several of already. As it stands I had to buy a usb extension cord to be able to reach where I wanted to place it. For the price though it\u2019s totally worth it. It\u2019s a really great fan, especially on a budget. I would absolutely recommend it!",
