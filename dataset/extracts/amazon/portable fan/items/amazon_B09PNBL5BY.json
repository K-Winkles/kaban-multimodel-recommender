                "reviewText": "Ok so I'm not proud of this, but I'm a total diva about my sleep conditions. I don't even know how I got here. But one of my requirements for sleep is a fan. I cannot sleep without one- the sound and the cool moving air. When I travel I must bring a fan. I've used several in the past and all have failed me, either because they aren't powerful enough, stop working, have faulty charging, take up too much suitcase space, and/or break in my suitcase likely due to TSA handling (still love you TSA).This is the best travel fan I've ever used. It is tiny yet powerful. It has multiple speed settings. I prefer medium, as the highest settings makes a high pitched sound. That is why I'm only giving 4 stars.The fan produces white noise proportionate to it's size. I use a white noise app to really achieve the full-size fan sensory experience.I have found that the battery charge lasts about 5 hours, so I keep the power cord plugged in while I use the fan overnight. The charging light is small, but bright. I put a sticker on it to make it less bright (I'm also a diva about any ambient light- I require total darkness).The fan tilts to many different angles which is great since the bedside table height at a hotel or guest room can vary. The best part about this fan is that it folds up so small and is almost flat, so it is so easy to pack. It is also very lightweight.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Minor Noise, Slightly Blocked Charge Port, But Overall Very Nice",
                "reviewText": "I've been using a USB fan for many years. The old fan is noisy (especially on lower speeds as it buzzes), awkward to reach to turn on and off given where it has to be tethered, and partially blocked by monitor edges. So I searched for one that would cure these ills.This fan does very well.Noise: A bit of a whine especially at higher speeds, but since I almost always am using it with my computer running and games playing, it's mostly not noticeable.Size: Small, which is what I want. Very slim footprint, not hugely tall, it can tuck in beside the monitor. Despite the size it has just enough pleasant heft to add a feel of luxury rather than cheapness.Power: A good strong breeze, at least at the arm's length distance I keep it at. Even on the low setting I tend to turn it away enough to just clip my face with the breeze as I'm sensitive to impacts on my face and it still cools me down quite quickly.Color: The white is fine, though black would blend in better with my monitor and keyboard. It's slightly off-white, just a little creamier in tone than a kleenex.Design: The edges have a very slight rounding, again adding that touch of luxury. The grill is slightly convex in front with solid spokes. The tilt is super easy to adjust but not floppy, it just pivots smoothly and holds where set. It's very stable as well, at least at any angle I've needed to use. The only negatives for me are that the power/speed button is on the back so I have to grope for it or move the fan around to see it, and the charging slot is positioned to make it a little difficult to stick the usb directly into it because the cord presses on the fan housing. Not impossible, just some wiggling needed along with double checking the usb is firmly seated.Charge duration: I don't know. It arrived fully charged. After I'd sporadically used it for a few hours I used the charging cable and the little led did the slow blink indicating it was charging, but then I was away long enough I can't say how long it took to get back to full. I've discovered my Pixel phone cable works with this so I don't have to keep swapping cables in the adapter, just choose whether phone or fan is getting charged. My second use of it had it running more steadily for a few hours, though generally I run a fan for a few minutes until I'm chilled, then off, then on again when sweating returns. Again I was away for a while as it recharged so I can't say exactly when the led went from blinking to steady.Portability: Heavier than I'd want to haul around in my purse for long (it feels just a little lighter than my iPad mini in swivel case or my Pixel 6) but for moving it on my desk or carrying it to the charging area it's no biggie. It is less convenient to have to keep charging it rather than just turning it on whenever I need it at the computer, but far more convenient to be able to put it anywhere on my desk I want as any moment demands. I'm very happy I got this fan.",

Granted I have not used this fan every single day but I\u2019ve used it more than enough to say it has held up well. The battery is still holding a good charge and overall I have been satisfied with the purchase.m",

My hubby doesn't like the very minimal sound though. But the sound is (for me) very minimal and the fan lasts (on low) all night. It's a great device and fairly powerful on low. The battery is -- amazing and I just put it onto my phone charger (android \"c\" charger) and when I take my phone off in the morning. I took it on a trip this summer, where there was no AC and it really helped. I just set it on the open window sill and it brought the cool air into the room and circulated it nicely. I would recommend NOT pointing it at your head, unless you want dry sinuses. I just point it at my feet. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a pretty darn quiet desk fan.",

                "reviewText": "Agr\u00e9ablement surprise par ce petit ventilateur. Choix de plusieurs vitesses, peu encombrant et leger, assez silencieux, meme si la vitesse la plus forte fait un petit bruit d\u2019air mais pas hyper g\u00eanant. Fourni avec un cable de charge cable usb c vers usb a mais pas la prise \u00e9lectrique (on peut utiliser celui de son telephone mobile). Ce petit ventilateur est parfait pour l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 et fonctionnant sur batterie, c\u2019est tres pratique pour les voyages. Notice seulement en anglais et chinois, et pas en fran\u00e7ais. Mais les dessins et fonctionnement sont faciles a comprendre. Excellent achat.",
