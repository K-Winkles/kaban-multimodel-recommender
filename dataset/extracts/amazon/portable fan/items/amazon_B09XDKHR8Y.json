                "reviewText": "I love it, but you have to get used to it. It will fit in any backpack or carrier bag, but it does have a tendency to turn on if you bump it. So make certain the power button isn't brushing up near anything in/around your bag. I would also suggest buying a secondary USB-C cord. The one that came with it was finicky sometimes Iironically, I bought one on Amazon (it was their Amazon basic brand) works like a dream.The battery is good. I will say the highest setting is the setting I use the most, but it will give you about 2-3 hours on a full charge if you don't have it plugged into a power source. On lower settings, it will go for hours.I use this fan in my day-to-day travels and mostly plug it into my laptop. I will say it does drain the battery of my laptop a bit so be wary and conscious of how long you do that.I have bought 3 over the course of 2 1/2 to 3 years. The first one broke but it was kind of rough on it. The second one, the fan blades got loose and I couldn't fix them. The last one works beautifully. I have recommended this fan to all my friends and co-workers and would do it again. It's a good buy at its price and a better buy if you find it at a discount.",

                "reviewText": "We were heading out on a 9 day cruise & needed a fan for our cabin since cruise ships are hit or miss when it comes to AC in the room. This fan came in just below the 12 inch cut off size for a fan. The charge up time wasn't too bad & it lasted most of the night on high. However I left it plugged in & that was the trick. Ran all night without an issue. Makes just enough noise to drowned out any outside noise but not loud enough to bother our sleep. It moves plenty of air to keep my wife happy & cool lol (husbands will get that). It comes with a cord but not the wall plug. That should be added but I just used my cellphone plug to charge it. My wife is super pleased with it & she says it's a must for taking a cruise! We highly recommend this fan!",

It's portable with good battery life, USB-C rechargeable/power.. just get a long 10 ft USB-C cable and that's it. Several settings, lowest is very quiet and highest is nice and powerful. The tilt and base footprint are perfect. Doesn't get any better.",

                "reviewText": "You know how it goes on Amazon when you're looking for something random like a fan. You can spend hours on the app. There are literally hundreds of vendors selling fans but there are only 10 fans. They all buy the same junk and put their name on it with some bs story in really bad grammar about why their fan is better than everyone else's. It can be very confusing. So I've started reading the reviews right away and click on verified purchases so I don't get the ones that got it for free in exchange for a good review.Well all of that being said I found this fan. I liked it right away because it was 8\" instead of 4 or 5 like most of the others and of course the price was great. The reviews are what got me though. Everyone had great things to say. Except for one guy that said the battery didn't last long. But the seller answered that review and didn't sound fake. Let me tell you.... that guy must've gotten a bad one or done something wrong because this thing goes and goes. I wish I could tell you how long exactly but I didn't think about it at the time but this is what happened. I immediately charged it over night. I got it for work. I'm an elevator attendant. I work in a very small metal elevator that has no exhaust fan. It gets in the upper 90's in there and I'm there for 7 hours. I used the fan for my entire shift then went home and it was a hot night so i used it all night forgetting to plug it in. The next day it lasted for my whole 7 hour shift. So that's 33 hours for sure of near constant use on the highest setting. I continued to use it at home that night but I had it plugged in the whole time.Which brings me to the other reason that I love this fan. Not only can you use it while it's charging, it actually doesn't get drained while you're doing it. After having it on high all night and the next day. When I went to work that night it lasted the whole shift. I brought a charger but never needed it.Unfortunately I can't tell you how long it takes to charge or exactly how long the battery will last because I use it all of the time and when I'm home it's always plugged in.What I can tell you is that this fan works as good if not better than they claim. It has 4 settings. 1 doesn't do much. 2 gives you a slight breeze. 3 would be OK as the highest setting if that's all that there was but 4 kicks. It ain't gonna cool a room but you will be comfortable. Also haven't had much experience with the timer cause I never want it to shut off.My one and only gripe is with the little C cord that is included. I went to plug it in the first time and immediately thought that I had broken the fan because I could feel the plug pushing the port in. This used to happen a lot with the older B cords. If you tried putting it in wrong and weren't careful you could wreck the port. Doesn't happen so much with the symmetrical C cords but this one was bad and almost cost me dearly. So be careful.Lastly this fan is plastic but I've dropped it a couple times and no problem, still works great. And being slim it fits into my backpack no problem.I hope this helped you decide. I really can't recommend this fan enough. If you need a small portable rechargeable fan... you won't go wrong with this one. I don't know the seller. I'm not getting anything for this review. I just love it that much that i want to tell everyone. So don't look any further. You found it. Add it to your cart. In a couple days you'll be as happy as I am. Peace.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this fan for a week and I've put it on the charger a couple of times but never really needed to because it hadn't run out of juice. I've run it 3 nights in a row on the low setting for 8 hrs./night and it's still going. I like a fan on the nightstand for airflow and white noise ... this fan, however is pretty quiet unless its on a higher setting ... and let me tell you, the high setting is strong (don't let the size of the fan fool you)! It's compact, sleek, and well designed and the controls are on the front so you're not reaching to the back of the fan to turn it on. It has a timer that I don't use. The LED's are a bit bright, so, if you like blackout sleeping, that could bother you, but a quick fix with electrical tape if it does. The only small design issue is the on/off button isn't illuminated or tactile enough to find quickly in the dark, but I've gotten used to where it is. I'm not a camper, but if you backpack and camp in a tent, this thing would be awesome. small enough to put in your pack and powerful enough to cool you down. I love the fact, that I can take it off the nightstand and put it next to me while I watch TV or out on the deck. Great fan!",
