I updated my stars to 5 because I do believe it was a good product, just user error!When I got this I was impressed by the power and battery life. That is the reason for the 3 stars.Now, I am 9 days passed the return window and this fan stopped working. I\u2019m not even sure it needed to be charged, but I plugged it in because we were gonna have a couple hot days. (I had used it a few times so I figured it could use a full charge.) The fan turned on and the speed was higher than the fastest setting. I unplugged it and the fan slowed down to a more normal setting but wouldn\u2019t shut off. In fact, the button now does nothing. I just had to let it die and it won\u2019t turn back on so now it\u2019s just another piece of garbage for the landfill. :(",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this snawowo fan in my grow tent for the last month or two now and it has been running constantly without many issues. It does great at keeping my LED lights cooled even at the lowest level, this thing would do great outside at the highest level to keep someone cool. Battery life is not too impressive, with about 3-4 hours on a single 18650 at low power (may be due to old batteries I am using). The great thing about this using 18650 batteries is you could keep a few inside your pocket to keep the fan running all day long.Every once in while the fan makes a squeaking noise, which so far has been fixed by a medium strength slap to the exterior. Although a minor thing, it is the only con I could think of after using it 24/7 for this long. The silicone arms on the unit also can make it difficult to mount in the tent, but would do great at gripping a stroller or umbrella while walking around a theme park. Actually a UV resistant umbrella with the fan wrapped around the handle sounds like the perfect way to enjoy the outdoors!",

The USB-C plug makes charging a breeze if of you have other devices that use that type of plug like most of us do.The bad: The flexible legs bend so to make attaching to strollers, bikes, etc. easy. But the same legs are made of a metal (aluminum I think) that breaks after a handful of uses. For example, during a Disney trip we took, we attached and removed the fan each time we got onto the trolly to get back and forth from the car. Didn\u2019t last long.",
