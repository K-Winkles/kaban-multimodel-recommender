                "reviewText": "What a Great little fan, it\u2019s fairly powerful for it\u2019s size, and moves quite a bit of air around that can be felt a ways away, I really like the oscillating with the 45 or 90 degree option, and another Great option is that it charges up pretty well while using it, the hook is convenient, and works well on oscillating, the light seems to be fairly bright with 3 different settings though haven\u2019t had much of a chance to use it yet, and the battery life seems pretty good! I would recommend this fan for anyone looking for a quality little rechargeable fan.",

The size and adjustability was great for inside the tents. Also had minimal noise. We have used them more than we expected and are holding up well. The remote was also a nice little bonus.",

It has 4 speed settings and the remote control works great. There's a spot behind the fan that holds the remote, thank God, or else I would've lost it already. There are other features on the fan that I won't mention, only because I don't use them. This is a wonderful fan to have during a, \"hot flash\"",

We used it for about 8 hours the other night and the battery only went down one power so it stays charged for a very long time. I have to give it a 5 star review. It's very nice for the $",

It's incredibly powerful for its size and the battery life is pretty long considering.We've even used this inside our home in our living room - it's THAT good.My husband loves the remote control feature. The light is incredibly bright, allowing it to double as a primary light source while camping. It's easy to charge and while it's kind of bulky, it's still small enough to pack with your gear (for car camping, I wouldn't suggest this for backpacking).",
