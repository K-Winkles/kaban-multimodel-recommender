It's has good power, long battery life and is not uncomfortable. I work indoors cleaning houses. It doesn't matter how cool the air conditioning is I am still sweating. This has made a huge difference keeping me cool. It does not blow air in the back. But it blows hard enough that if I have it higher than the low setting it makes my eyes water. I purchased the smaller white one somewhere else and it just doesn't compare even taking in to account it blows in the back. One thing to keep in mind, it just blows air. If you are outside in the heat then it blows hot air. If you are inside in air conditioning then it blows cool air. Meets my needs perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "I received it today and was able to charge it fully before going into work this afternoon. I used it for about two hours on low speed and it stayed running the whole time. I like the shape as it sits well without just trying to fall off. I also like the blue color it is nice. I only used it on level 1 today and it was quiet while providing a nice breeze.On the downside it does not have a digital display or even lights to tell you how much charge is left. There is one light that is red when it is charging and green when it is full. The paperwork with it also said you need to be careful not to over charge it so just plugging it in overnight or otherwise taking your eye off of it while charging is probably not a good idea. It has a metal plate at the back of the neck simulating a cooling plate, but this model does not offer that feature unfortunately. The vents do not go all the way aroundIn the display photo it looked like it would but it is purely decorative. Otherwise, it is light and worked well for me today. I will test it more tomorrow and would like to do a run time test to see if it will really last as long as is claimed. The higher power battery vs cost is the main reason I picked this one instead of what I really wanted.",

It's not as quiet as I would like for it to but, but it's a fan, it's going to make some noise. Besides the shutting off issue I like it.",
