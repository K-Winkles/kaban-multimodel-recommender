It is so great and pretty quiet on the lowest setting. My next plan is to try it on the high setting while walking along the beach. Big plusses are it's a perfect size (not too small or big), charge lasts a long time - I have had it on for hours and battery still wasn't empty, various tilt angles, doesn't get hot when using it, fits in my purse and it can act as a desktop phone holder so I can watch a video hands-free. Some reviews mention that it uses the older USB charging connector but I don't mind that. My portable battery has multiple charging connector tips. And most folks have an old school charging cord in a drawer somewhere. Can pick one up for a few bucks nowadays if needed. Happy using!",

                "reviewText": "Bought this fan about 8 months ago, and in the beginning, this was a great buy. A fan with three speeds, a phone holder (landscape), and a power bank. For example, when I worked in a warehouse back when I purchased this, this item was crucial for me to have a good lunch break. I would prop my phone on the indented slot on the fan, plug it in and charge my phone, and have the fan running on a medium speed. My lunch breaks were drastically changed after buying this, since I can charge my phone, watch netflix, and get cooled down all without having to touch my phone. At the time, this was a 5 star item without a doubt.Fast forward 8 months, and unfortunately the fan seems to be nearing the end of its life. The battery life on the fan is very weak (used to be able to last multiple days, without having to charge it, with an hour or 2 of use a day). Now, the fan will last about 20 minutes on high, 30 minutes on medium, and 45 minutes on low, and that's without anything plugged into the power bank side of it. Solely the fan consuming the battery. Also, the fan blades themselves or most likely the motor now makes a weird noise. It either sounds like the blades are hitting something, or the motor is dying. I believe it is the motor, because the blades sound fine during the boot up sequence.TLDR: At first, this fan is a really great buy, and I would give it a 5/5. But the issues come as time goes on, the fan motor, and battery life quickly depreciates.",

The cute fan is what I need when I want to cool down my phone has it\u2019s charging or when I want to cool down a little bit. It\u2019s a small quiet fan, that works for me.My only worry is the charging port. My last one broke because the charging port got pushed in too far back. My old one lasted me about 2 yrs or more, so I hope this one is the same as well",
