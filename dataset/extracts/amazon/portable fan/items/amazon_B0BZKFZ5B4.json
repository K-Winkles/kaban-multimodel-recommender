            "3-in-1 Handheld/Neck Hanging/Desktop Portable Fan\uff1aIntroducing the psecici portable fan that combines handheld, desktop, and neck-hanging functions. The fan body is equipped with a strap attachment hole, and when used with the included strap, it can be used as a neck-hanging fan, freeing up both hands, making it less tiring for long-time use, and ideal for work or sports.",
            "180\u00b0 Foldable\uff1aUnlike traditional desktop fans, our fan achieves desktop functionality by folding. It can be folded 180\u00b0 in the up and down direction, allowing you to adjust the angle to your preference. This handy fan is perfect for various occasions, from short outings to outdoor events during hot seasons.",
            "Revolutionary Brushless Motor & Long-lasting Operation\uff1aOur handy fan adopts a revolutionary brushless motor, offering high durability, high power, and ultra-quiet low noise. Unlike commercially available brushless motors, our brushless motor uses a grooved bearing structure to significantly reduce friction, reduce heat generation, increase efficiency, improve motor durability, and ensure low noise operation.",
            "Ultra-Quiet 20dB\uff1aAt the weak mode, the operating noise is as low as 20 decibels, providing powerful cool air during study or work. Although the built-in battery capacity is not large, it has a comparable operating time to large-capacity fans on the market. The weak mode allows for up to 16 hours of continuous operation, and it only takes 3-4 hours to fully charge, making it an energy-saving handy fan.",
            "4-level Wind Speed Adjustment\uff1aThe handheld fan features 4 levels of wind speed adjustment. By pressing the wind speed switch button, you can finely adjust the wind speed from a gentle natural breeze to a powerful wind. Indoors, the 1-3 levels of natural wind, breeze, and weak wind mode recreate a gentle natural breeze, providing comfort in the workplace or library with ultra-quiet operation. In outdoor summer events, bringing a refreshing coolness even in extreme heat.",
            "7-blade & Streamlined Design\uff1aCompared to conventional products, our handheld fan adopts a 7-blade design with a streamlined design across the entire blade, efficiently utilizing the center of the blade to gather wind. By reducing air resistance, it produces a smooth, balanced wind with minimal wind speed fluctuations.",
            "USB Charging\uff1aThe handheld fan is equipped with a USB port, supports various charging methods, and can be charged with a computer, charger, or mobile battery. It is also possible to charge while delivering air, so you can feel secure when going out."

If you are a woman of a certain age or you just suffer from hot flashes then is a MUST HAVE especially for travel.Hotels rarely have opening windows and it can feel like you can't get any air so this is where this phenomenal little gadget becomes invaluable. You can place it by your bed, it sits up on its own stand and this little fan will run all night quietly too and keep you cool. It has three speed settings and the highest will blow your hair back it's so impressive.Also on a plane, it's easy to pull out and just either hold or sit on your seat table, seriously it's heavenly. The flashlight is extremely bright and handy and lets talk about the fact it's also a really superb little power bank which will happily charge most electronic items. It holds a charge for a long time too. This one item saves a lot of travel space - it's a winner for a gift idea too. Cannot do without it.",

I need a small portable fan I could easily fit in my purse to discreetly cool myself down! This fan is PERFECT!!! It is silent, small, and STRONG! I have ended up using it a ton! I take it out on the hot sunny playground, field day, church, even on walks with my dog! It is handheld but also comes with a cord attachment to hang around your neck! Comes with a charging cord which I just plug it in at night and its ready to go! Charge lasts hours and hours! This would be a perfect fan to take on vacation or to use on strollers for babies. I highly recommend this fan as it is extremely cost effective but very powerful and well made! It has definitely helped cool me down during these hot summer days!",
