                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great little powerful fan with cool mist",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Pros:1. High quality material, unlike typical cheap Chinese junk.2. The fan is very powerful. Even on weakest level, you can feel it. At the 3rd level (most powerful), it's super strong.3. The mist is also very powerful and as you can see from my video, in just a few seconds, a droplet of water forms. I camp in an arid high desert area every year and need to bring humidifiers to help lessen the dry air effects at night when I sleep in my tent. Most humidifiers spray a very fine mist, almost useless in the grand scheme when fighting against arid desert air. However, this one, while also spraying a fine mist which easily disperses into the atmosphere, sprays it at a much more powerful level. As such, coupled with the fan, it actually has a cooling effect, like a swamp cooler. I took a picture of my thermometer showing 74.5 degrees F, and after running this fan at lowest setting with the mist on it, the temps dropped to 72.3 degrees F, with humidity rising slightly as expected, in 5 minutes. While this isn't an Earth-shattering effect, it shows the science of water evaporating absorbing heat from the surrounding. And I can assure you the cooling effect feels much more than a mere 2 degrees F. My thermometer has a delayed reaction, and running the fan and mist on your face, you'll immediately feel the difference, as if there's a 5-10 degree temperature difference, depending on relative humidity.Swamp coolers in arid (hot, dry, low humidity) air works because of the science of how water is evaporated. When a gas expands in volume, or when a liquid or solid turns into gas (ie water vapor, increasing the humidity), the water molecules absorb heat from each other and the surrounding. Heat is an ingredient, a reactant, so to speak. It's a scientific certainty, a factual requirement. Temperature therefore goes down as a result. So when the mist is sprayed on you with wind (ie energy), this evaporates the water molecules, thus cooling down the remaining water and wind that is directed towards you.4. The fan can stand on it's own with good stability and blow on you.5. Built in rechargable batteries mean no need to carry extra batteries.Cons:1. Built in batteries mean you can't swap out batteries at will, especially once the batteries go bad. However, you'll run out of water many times over before the batteries run out as the battery appears to be long lasting.2. The water reservoir is very small, only 20 ml, which will be used up fast. The bottle supplied has a 30 ml mark and a line for 20 and 10. You only need the 20. My initial tests show the water is used up in approximately 10 minutes.3. You need to carry the little supplied water bottle with you to refill the reservoir due to how close the opening is to the fan, and the small size opening. You risk getting the fan wet if you simply poured water into the opening. I tested successfully using a straw by inserting it into the small opening, and positioning the other end under running water, with the other end higher in elevation than the opening of the water reservoir. However, it'll fill FAST so I had to move the straw out from the water quickly.4. My 3 year old, turning 4 years old in 4 months, can stick her pinky into the back guard rails, touching the fan blades. This is not safe for kids given the powerful fans on level 3 power.Other Thoughts:1. I can see myself using this as a humidifier, but would need to constantly refill water.2. I'd suggest the manufacturer decrease the size of the openings between fan blades guards to prevent children from sticking their fingers in, increase the reservoir of water, and change the opening and/or location so it doesn't require carrying a small bottle for water refills.",

Quiet operation with good airflow and the mist density is better on this fan than any other we tried. Also excellent battery life! I used it almost constantly from park open at 8:30 am to park close at 9:00 pm on one charge. Excellent product, I'm buying a backup!",

When received one of the blades was already broken during transit so that speaks to durability, but even with the missing blade this little guy does a good job of cooling and misting. The little water bottle makes refilling the reservoir super easy and the buttons make it quick to turn on, adjust the fan, and start/stop mist. Charge last for several days, has an indicator to show battery life, easily charged where ever a usb can plug in, and mist lasts for about an hour of use depending on how hot it is. It\u2019s now a staple in my car for any hot days or trips and everyone fights over it. Highly recommend for anyone planning to be in hot and/or humid weather.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased two of these portable misting fans in an attempt to survive our daughter's deadly, humid, thick, southern, summer softball games. It seriously feels like you're breathing hot soup in August outside in our area. The product did not disappoint. This little guy puts out a lot of air, and the mist is so fine, it doesn't make my mascara run, so it's great for milfs on the go. I enjoy the flat base for free standing and the swivel top, so you can enjoy the cooling effect but you're not stuck holding a fan when your kid makes a great play, both hands will be free to wave in the air or to flip off the ump. A double bird flip just feels better and this thing makes it possible. I will never not have this in my car.",
