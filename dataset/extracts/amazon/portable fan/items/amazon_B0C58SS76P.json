                "reviewText": "I was miserable with hot flashes. I had tried many other fans before. The others all had something wrong with them-too noisy, too much air, too little air, not stable, didn't hold charge. Then I found this perfect fan! Quiet - actually silent on lower settings. Lots of choices from gentle, gentle breeze to strong flow! My new best friend fan lulls me to sleep on the gentle breeze setting and keeps me cool all night. Switched to a higher setting, it takes away the discomfort of a full blown daytime hot flash in an instant. Recharge lasts a long, long time (10 nights at least) and, if I want, I can just add a USB plug and it goes forever! I carry one with me at all times, charged and ready to go. Conveniently, it tells me how much power I have left! I bought one, then another! In that way, I can charge one and carry it with me, while the other waits at home, fully charged, ready to substitute for the first when I need to switch them out. It worked so well, I've bought several more tao put away for the future. It gives me so much pleasure, my husband decided to try it. Now, he has his own and loves it as much as I. A++++++++++++ and so much more!",

Battery last a long time, easy to charge, and love that I can recharge it rather than use batteries. The 5 levels of fan speed is fantastic, level one and two are sufficient but when I'm outside having level five is absolutely amazing. Level 1 is great during meetings, quiet enough that it doesn't disturb the meeting at all. Highly recommend purchasing, great gift for anyone you know that has hot flash or gets hot easily.",

                "reviewText": "The fan is powerful and quiet even at the fifth speed. The straps make it convenient to be placed around the neck for hands-free transportation. When placed on a table or stand the effect can be felt from 2 ft. away even at the first level. The impact can be felt even from a distance greater than 2 ft. as you increase the levels of intensity. The battery life is commendable as even with constant usage throughout the day there is still battery life left in the evening. I did note that when it is being recharged, the battery monitor shows 99% for a long time before it shows 100%. Nevertheless, this is not a major concern.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this Battery Fan ,EasyAcc Rechargeable Fan with LG 2600mA Battery at the end of this past June. This is an amazing little fan. I wish I would have had one all of my my life but I just recently discovered it on Amazon.I can carry it all over the house with me and it's happy wherever I set it down. On a really hot day (like we've been having lately) I even carry it to the bathroom to use while I'm sitting there. It's nice to keep that breeze going.Tonight as I write this review I have it blowing on my internet modem to keep it cool.When I received my fan and discovered that I liked it so much I sent 2 of them to a friend. She keeps one on her computer table and one on her bed's nightstand.The main reason I bought the first fan is because in the Summer we usually get a lot of power outages; so I figured this time around for this Summer I would have a battery powered fan on hand for when the power goes out and it's 95 degrees so I could get a bit of relief from the heat.EasyAcc to the rescue! LOL.At the same time I ordered this fan I also ordered the EasyAcc Mini Handheld Fan USB Desk Fan with 4000mAh Rechargeable Battery Operated 23Hours 3 Speeds; which by the way is also a very impressive little fan and blows a very good breeze and is ultra-portable, but with it's 4000 mah battery it does NOT skimp on wind power or runtime.It's small enough to carry along anywhere; even in your purse if you carry one.So now I have 2 EasyAcc battery fans with extended runtimes so at least now I am sure to have some comfort this Summer when the lights go out. (They always do.)",

A must have during hot weather, and the battery percentage display is nice to have as well, compared to other models with lights only.I haven't tested the actual battery capacity but being able to act as a portable battery for a phone is a great feature.One small thing is the strap that comes to hang it around the neck attaches at a weird spot, so you can't really use it hands free to blow onto your face while walking, as it keeps rolling around. Having clip points elsewhere to point at the face would be a nice improvement.",
