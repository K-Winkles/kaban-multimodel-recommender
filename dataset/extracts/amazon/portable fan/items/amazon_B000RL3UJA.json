                "reviewText": "Let me tell you about my experience with the Lasko Oscillating Tower Fan, and why I think it deserves a 5-star rating.First off, let me just say that I have been through my fair share of fans. From the cheap, flimsy ones that barely produce any breeze, to the bulky, noisy ones that are impossible to sleep next to. So when I stumbled upon the Lasko Oscillating Tower Fan, I was cautiously optimistic. But let me tell you, this fan did not disappoint.From the moment I took it out of the box, I knew this was going to be different. The sleek silver design is not only aesthetically pleasing, but it also looks and feels incredibly sturdy. And with a height of 42 inches, it's the perfect size for my bedroom.But what really sets this fan apart is its functionality. The remote control makes it so easy to adjust the settings from across the room, and the timer feature is a game-changer. I no longer have to worry about falling asleep with the fan on all night and waking up freezing. I can set it for 2, 4, or 8 hours and know that it will automatically turn off when I want it to.And the best part? This fan is QUIET. I mean, really quiet. Even on the highest setting, it produces a gentle hum that's actually soothing to fall asleep to. I no longer have to choose between sweating in my sleep or being kept awake by a noisy fan.But let me tell you, the true test of this fan came during a recent heatwave. I live in a third-floor apartment with no AC, so things can get pretty toasty in the summer. I was sweating through the night and couldn't get comfortable no matter how many times I flipped my pillow. That is, until I turned on my Lasko Oscillating Tower Fan.Within minutes, the cool breeze had me feeling like I was sleeping in a luxurious hotel room. I fell asleep faster and slept more soundly than I had in weeks. And when I woke up, I wasn't sweating through my sheets or feeling like a zombie from lack of sleep. I felt refreshed and ready to tackle the day.But let's talk about the oscillating feature for a minute. I love that it can be adjusted to cover a wide or narrow area, depending on my needs. And the fact that it oscillates means that the cool air is constantly circulating throughout the room, so there are no hot spots or stagnant air.I have to mention the price. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the Lasko Oscillating Tower Fan is very affordable, especially considering its quality and functionality. I've spent more money on fans that didn't work half as well as this one.Now, let's talk about the setup. It was incredibly easy to assemble and took me less than 10 minutes to put it together. The instructions were straightforward and all the pieces fit perfectly, so I didn't have to struggle or curse my way through the process. And once it was assembled, I was blown away (pun intended) by how good it looked.The tower design is sleek and modern, and it seamlessly blends into any room decor. I love that it doesn't take up much space and can be placed in a corner without obstructing anything. And the silver finish adds a touch of sophistication to my living room.But let's not forget about the real reason why we buy fans - to keep us cool. And the Lasko Oscillating Tower Fan delivers in spades. It has three different speed settings, which I appreciate because sometimes I just need a gentle breeze to keep me comfortable. And the air flow is strong enough to cool me down on the hottest days, but not so strong that it feels like a hurricane is blowing through my apartment.And like the previous reviewer mentioned, the timer and remote control features are a godsend. I love that I can set the fan to turn off after a certain amount of time, so I don't have to worry about wasting energy or waking up freezing in the middle of the night. And the remote control means that I can adjust the settings without having to get up from the couch or my bed.Overall, I would highly recommend the Lasko Oscillating Tower Fan to anyone in the market for a new fan. It's functional, stylish, and most importantly, it gets the job done without being a nuisance. It's the perfect addition to any bedroom, living room, or office. So go ahead and treat yourself to the best damn fan on the market. You won't regret it.",

It's the perfect height, is not always blowing directly on me while oscillating (but it can be kept stationary if so desired). Keeps me comfortable. It's quiet, has the convenient remote control & the white noise for sleep is nice. It offers various speeds too. A good purchase & a good choice. It's nice-looking too.",

                "reviewText": "Omg, how have I not had a fan tower before? This thing dumps out air like nobody\u2019s business.This year my wife and I moved to a new apartment that didn\u2019t have any AC. Due to various reasons, a window unit wouldn\u2019t work, and a floor AC unit was just about 5x what I could afford to drop.I luckily found this guy and it saved our sweaty butts.Pros: features are minimal. It has 3 power settings with enough variation between them to notice they\u2019re different, while not being over- or underwhelming at either end of the range. 3 during the day when it\u2019s roasting and 1 at night to sleep to. The oscillation is plenty as well.There appears to be some time settings and a remote, but it\u2019s real easy to just poke the button on top: on or off, levels 1, 2, or 3, etc.It\u2019s also very quiet. On mode 1 you can tell it\u2019s on, but it isn\u2019t intrusive or noticeable over conversation or if you\u2019re trying to sleep.Cons: features are minimal. If you\u2019d like automated settings, time on/off, more variation in power levels, an LCD menu, this fan isn\u2019t for you.I am also sure that while it is quiet, I\u2019d bet $100 that there are quieter fans out there.For what I\u2019d consider a \u201cbudget\u201d fan, this thing absolutely stomps. I have no doubt I\u2019ll be holding onto this fan for years to come.It has done such a good job, it has definitely made me a\u2026 fan.",

                "reviewText": "The Lasko 42\" Wind Curve (wih ionizer) is a very good fan and is powerful enough for 20 x 20 foot room. The tall height works well in a bedroom where one might need to feel the breeze a bit higher while laying on a high mattress. You can also adjust the top portion of the vent up or down for your needs. The remote is handy for just such an occasion as well. The Lasko was very quiet despite its powerful breeze. The base is sturdy and I have experienced no rattling.I compared the Lasko fan to the Holmes 32\" Oscillating Tower Fan and there was no comparison. The Holmes fan was too short to generate a breeze above my bed where I needed it. The power of the fan was also extremely weak in general--especially since it was being advertised as a whole house fan. Essentially, Holme's most powerful breeze was equivalent to the lowest setting on the Lasko. The interface was confusing. And there also was no remote. The Holmes base is sturdy and I experienced no rattling.I also compared the Lasko to the Sunter 40\" Tower Fan (2 Pack Combo with a 13\" Personal Fan). While I preferred the look of the Lasko (the silver color made it more versatile for both dark and light color themes), the truth is, of all three, the Sunter was the most powerful--though maybe only a step above. The 40\" height was still high enough to reach over the bed where I needed it. Its top portion of the vent is not adjustable up-and-down like the Lasko--but most fans don't have that feature. The Sunter was fairly quiet, but not as quiet as the Lasko. The remote appears chintzier than the Lasko's but it turns out Sunter's remote range is stronger than the Lasko's. The Sunter base is sturdy and I experienced no rattling. However, I did experience vibration and rattling with its bonus personal 13\" fan that came with it.Of all three fans, the Lasko was the easiest to assemble. I felt the Lasko was the most attractively versatile with its silver finish. Both the Lasko and Sunter have an easy interface to understand. Both were sturdy and did not rattle. The Lasko has the quietest breeze, with the Sunter a close quiet second. However, the Sunter offered the strongest breeze, with Lasko being a close second. Both were good for 20 x 20' rooms. The Lasko offers three speed settings; the Sunter offers four speed settings. Both offer timers. The Lasko offers an ionizer feature which is nice; however, the Sunter offers an interesting evening breeze feature. (The evening breeze feature tapers off the breeze to the next lowest level every half an hour as you drift off to sleep--VERY nice.)Finally, [at the time of this review] the Lasko costs $56.52 on Amazon; while the Sunter costs $39.99 at Costco (or $44.32 on Amazon). The $16 higher price for the Lasko dramatically altered my star rating for the product down to a 4-star. And since the Sunter is fairly comparable (with a bonus fan) at a dramatically cheaper price, I am posting a 5-star for the Sunter as a best-buy.",

                "reviewText": "Desde hace trece a\u00f1os tengo un calefactor lasko sin que presente problemas. De ah\u00ed mi elecci\u00f3n por esta marca.Es muy sencillo armar el pedestal y ya ensamblado el ventilador alcanza algo m\u00e1s de un metro de altura.Funciona bien. En el primer nivel de intensidad percibes bien la r\u00e1faga a dos metros de distancia y a tres metros ya se siente menos, pero a\u00fan es notoria. El material es bueno, porque no requieres m\u00e1s. Un material m\u00e1s robusto lo har\u00eda pesado y ello impactar\u00eda en el consumo de energ\u00eda.La abertura de ventilaci\u00f3n cubre, aproximadamente, un sesenta por ciento de la altura del ventilador, pero s\u00ed expele aire por toda la ranura. He visto ventiladores que no lo hacen as\u00ed.Creo que le falta rango de cobertura en el giro; de los 180\u00b0 que corresponden al frente (ning\u00fan ventilador los cubre), abarca 60\u00b0; pero es una apreciaci\u00f3n personal y puede no compratirla mucha gente.Agradezco que es ligero y m\u00e1s lo agradecer\u00e1n usuarios de la tercera edad o personas que no puedan cargar objetos pesados. Su volumen no es muy estrecho, pero ese factor ya es algo que puede afectar de formas muy puntuales.Los controles proyectan muy poca luz, as\u00ed que no es inc\u00f3modo ni distractor (incluyo im\u00e1gen); hace ruido, como todos, pero no es desagradable, ni siquiera en la mayor intensidad.Puntos espec\u00edficos:- NO ES IONIZADOR- INCLUYE CONTROL REMOTO- POSEE TRES NIVELES DE INTENSIDAD- APAGADO AUTOM\u00c1TICO: 30 min. - 7.5 hs.Me cost\u00f3 dos mil pesos y pude haberlo comprado por mil setecientos cuando est\u00e1bamos en los frios invernales. Se ir\u00e1n encareciendo estos aparatos desde ahora.",

This was very easy to assemble and light weight to move around the house. The remote works perfectly and it has 3 speeds which makes it easier to use as per the weather. It is very sturdy though lightweight. Best fan ever and once you feel the cool breeze of this fan you cannot live without it.",
