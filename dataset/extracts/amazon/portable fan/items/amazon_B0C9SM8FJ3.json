They both use them overnight when sleeping and it keeps them comfortable throughout the night. It\u2019s easy to turn on and off and tilts easily as well even my eight-year-old can do it. We have it clipped onto their bed which is made out of a 2 x 4 and it fits comfortably on there that I don\u2019t have to worry about it coming off. We have these plugged into the wall. The cord could be a little longer, though especially because one of these has to be plugged in on a bunkbed.",

Then faster and then the speed it was set for, but it took 60 seconds to do so. It acted like it had a better connection. Then the next day the fan blade started to wobble instead of running smoot. Like it wasn't screwed in all the way. 2 days later it stopped working. Every once in a while it would run for about 10 or 15 seconds then stop again. I have been completely taken by these folks. Dont make the same mistake I did, buy a differant fan from a different company. Amazon should not let these people use Amazon to sell their cheap crap.DO NOT BUY THIS FAN!!!",

                "reviewText": "This may not happen for everyone. I clipped this fan onto a computer monitor in my office to keep cool during summer days. (My home lacks central air.). It was great in the beginning. Last night, I walked into my office (I had left this fan on all day, forgetting to turn it off), and was struck my a low level hummm noise that wasn't there before. Seems like before, all the noise it made was the sound of the air blowing... but it developed a noticeable motor noise coming from the housing. I might not bother many people. In fact, unless you work in a very silent area it might not bother you at all, but my hearing is very sensitive. I work with audio a lot and so any unnecessary noise bothers me. I don't think I have the box anymore so I won't bother returning it, but I may spend a bit more for another brand in the future.",

                "reviewText": "We use these fans (bought two) for the kid\u02bbs bunk beds. I bought these specifically because they were plug in. Other ones that were battery operated or rechargeable were not worth it. You need to buy these electric fans. They clip on side of bed, long cord and you don\u02bbt need to worry about changing battery. Great purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a plant tent for my citrus and needed a fan to put inside. Didn't want to spend much and found this cheap. It has a clip so you can put it anywhere and it's flexible so you can angle it in a variety of directions. Put it in the tent w/the lights on a timer and it's been working 16 hrs a day since then w/o a hitch. It gives off enough air and isn't horribly loud. It's just another Chinese product, so many of which are absolute junk, but so far I am very pleased with this purchase.",
