                "reviewText": "I'm pleasantly surprised how well this works. While I didn't achieve quite the optimistic recharge or runtime times that the manufacturer claims, I still got pretty impressive real-world results. (See below).The 6 available speeds offer a good deal of variability in how much air the fan moves. The pivoting head gives it a bunch of flexibility to sit or stand and blow air at various angles. It also is really quiet - barely perceptible at its lowest speed. It has a digital \"fuel gauge\" to indicate how much battery capacity remains but, as I found in my testing, it is bit deceiving because it doesn't decrease at the same rate. It actually loses capacity faster the longer it runs - draining very slowly at the start but draining faster as it goes along.I can verify that it comes with a strap and the fan can actually be worn around your neck and pointed so that the air is blown up onto your chin and face. If it was hot enough, I'm sure it would be welcome relief. But it would have to be pretty darn hot for me to wear something like that. But, hey, it works - so to each their own, I suppose.As far as charging it, using the USB-C input, my device charged from 0 to 100% in 5 hours 25 minutes. That is significantly slower than what the manufacturer says so I'm not sure if my USB charger is not big enough to achieve that or if their charging numbers are too optimistic.As far as running the fan, I ran two tests. First, I charged the fan to 100% and ran it -continuously- on its highest speed. It ran that way for about 3 1/2 hours straight before dropping all the way to 0% and shutting off. Again, note that the battery does not have linear decline. In fact, the last 25% of the battery depleted much quicker than the first 75% did. That aside, the end result of getting 3 1/2 hours of continuous use at its highest speed is really good. That highest speed is simply too strong for me and I'd never run it that high, anyway.Now, on the other end of the spectrum, I again charged the fan back to 100% and this time I ran the fan at its -slowest- speed (setting #1). The fan ran continuously for FIFTEEN HOURS and 1 minute. Wow! Not quite the 16 hours the site claims but still fantastic. That is a full day of continuous fan breeze even at a place like Disney World or something. So that is really nice.Not to belabor a point but I want to point out again that the decline in battery percentage is far, far from linear. It took 12 hours to go from 100% to 50% but just 3 more hours to go from 50% down to 0%. Not really a problem since I know how long to expect out of the fan but just don't rely on the fuel gauge and assume anything.All in all, I am pleased to say that this is a good product for a fair price. The fan is light weight and seems sturdy enough. It has plenty of runtime - especially considering you have different speeds to choose from - and has a flexible tilting head. While I wouldn't use the neck fan option much, it is good to know it can do it. I just didn't get the same recharge and runtime results from my actual testing versus what the manufacturer claims. Still good results but not quite the same. Your mileage may vary, as well.",

                "reviewText": "This is a surprisingly quiet and powerful handheld rechargeable fan that you can also hang on your neck to provide airflow for your face or use as a charger for your phone.The fan really is super quiet. In fact, it's quieter than any of the other portable fans that my wife and I have (and we have quite a few). It does make a slight high-pitched whirring sound, which gets progressively louder as you increase the speed, but it didn't bother either of us. Even at the highest, sixth speed, I didn't think it was loud, and I'm pretty sensitive to fan noises.The fan is also incredibly powerful. My wife and I both think it's entirely adequate at even the lowest of the six speeds when held at arm's length. I tried it on a console over 5 feet away from my easy chair and found the airflow just right at the lowest speed. Keep in mind that the airflow covers a fairly narrow area, so it's mostly for cooling your face.The fan has a smooth black plastic surface that's free of mold marks. The openings in the fan cover grill are small enough to prevent a finger from coming into contact with the spinning fan blade. The reflective metallic orange strip on the fan cover looks really nice. The removable hanging cord has a very nice, soft feel, though I think the white color of the cord is a bit of a design miss on the black fan and may get dirty if you use the fan outdoors. The fan feels solid at 200g (about the same as an iPhone 14 Plus) but isn't too heavy to hold or hang from your neck. It has a small flat base that provides stable support if you want to put it on a desk or table. It even has an LED display showing percentage of charge remaining. The fan head swivels up and down (but not sideways--you just rotate the base for that).This is my favorite portable fan for close-up use on a desk or cabinet near a sofa or easy chair, mainly because it is so quiet and small. My wife also likes to use it hanging from her neck and it's her favorite for that. Given the features and low price, I think it's almost perfect.",
