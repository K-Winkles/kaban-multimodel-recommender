                "reviewText": "This personal fan can be used in a multitude of situations. The actual fan attaches to the tripod by sliding the 2 pieces together via a connector. This connection feels very secure and doesn\u2019t feel like they could separate easily. The tripod consists of this connector and 3 sturdy, flexible legs that wrap around objects to secure fan and can then be bent to position the fan how you choose. It is marketed as a stroller fan. You would mount it on the bar you hold onto to push the stroller and point it toward your face. Another suggestion is to use as a table fan. I wasn\u2019t sure the flexible legs would hold the fan in an upright position without tipping over but I moved them around a bit and they did in fact hold the fan in an upright position on a table. The fan had 60% charge out of the box and instructions say it takes 3 hours to fully charge. It is recommended that once battery has reached full charge it be removed from the charger as not to cause harm to the battery which will reduce it\u2019s longevity. Runtime is then 3-7 hours. There is a digital display in the center of the cage that houses the fan that indicates battery level and fan speed (1-3). There\u2019s a button on the back of this cage that cycles through these settings by short pressing the button. It is located to the right of the Type C charging port (charging cord included). Online descriptions gives these fan measurements but I don\u2019t believe they are correct 5.35\u2019D x 2.59\u201dW x 4.21\u201dH. The fan can be rotated a full 360\u2019 both up and down and around. The fan operates and is able to be positioned exactly as described and I do recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "This stroller fan is ver high quality. I had one previously for my baby from a random brand and it wasn't as good quality as this one. My last one felt all plastic and cheap, this one feels very sturdy. I love the digital screen to tell how much battery life is left. My last one just had three little lights I believe and I had to guess when exactly it would shut off. I also like the flexible grip, it is very easy to maneuver. The fan can be swivels 360 degrees. It has three power setting and let me see the highest setting is quite strong! It isn't the most quietest but I don't mind because the sound may put my baby to sleep. This will also tell you that I'm not exaggerating when I mention how fast the speed of the highest setting is. I know this will keep my baby very comfortable in the heat. It is pretty safe when it comes to the spacing of the holes in the fan but I still would supervise your child when using, you never know. My fan did come 57% charged. It came with a charger which is nice. I like how you can take the fan head off and charge it without having to rewrap the grip. I haven't fully tested out the battery life but I will come back and update. I highly recommend this, and not just to parents! This would be great to carry around in the summer, to keep at the office, and even to bring to the hospital with you! Please do yourself a favor and purchase!",

                "reviewText": "Like the adjustable arms. I put this on my peloton for some additional airflow on my face. It feels good and has three levels. The air output is sufficient. I like that the vase is removable to charge so you don\u2019t have to unattach the arms. I\u2019m not too sure how long the charge lasts or how long it takes for a recharge but that will be important to note after more use.",

                "reviewText": "I got this, not for a stroller, but for my camper chair while I'm watching my daughter play college softball. It is GREAT!! The base and fan came as separate pieces. They were easy to snap together, and do come back apart with a little pull. The legs are VERY versatile! Each little \"bead\" you see in the photos is a joint, so they are very flexible, yet very sturdy. Shown in the photos, I have it standing on a table and attached to my tumbler's handle.The legs have a smooth, rubbery coating on them for protection. The fan housing and arm are made of sturdy plastic that is good quality. The head swivels 360 degrees vertically AND rotates 360 horizontally as well. It also has an LED display that shows which setting it's on. There are 4 settings: 3 speeds and off/on. It also displays the battery %. You cycle through the settings using a button on the back, and the USB-C port is also on the back. The swivel head is easy to move, but tight enough that it keeps its place.It also puts out a LOT of air!! I was surprised by this, as you never know with these fans. I am very impressed with this fan, and definitely recommend it to anyone who needs to keep themselves or their kids/friends cool on a hot day! Side note: It came charged at 54%, and after using it for less than 2 minutes, the % went down to 52%, so we'll see how long the battery life is.",

                "reviewText": "What made me ultimately decide to order this was the digital read out of the battery level. I've always disliked only having like, 4 lights that indicate the battery level. Or even, nothing to indicate it. And speaking of the battery, when it's fully charged it can provide around 3 hours of use on the high setting, probably 5 hours of use on the medium setting, and about 7 hours of use on the low setting. Then it takes about 3 hours to charge the battery. There's no power brick or anything like that included for charging it. But that's pretty standard with these kinds of rechargeable devices, so I'm not surprised. As usual though, it does come with a cable for charging it, that has a USB-C connection on one end, that plugs into the USB-C port on the back of the fan. And a regular USB-A connection on the other end, that is meant to plug into whatever power source that you plan to use.Well, like I said in the headline. This kind of fan is also good to have in case of emergencies. A few years ago we lost power for nearly a WEEK after a small hurricane had come through here, and it was in the thick of summer. And let me just say, it's unbelievable what a difference a small fan can make in that situation, even when it's just on the low speed. But basically, if you're someone who's looking for a little fan like this, I could definitely recommend this one. Regardless of what you need it for.",
