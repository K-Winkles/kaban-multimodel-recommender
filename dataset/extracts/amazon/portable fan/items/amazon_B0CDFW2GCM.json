Something I didn't see anywhere: if you hold the button down, the light goes off which helps conserve battery. My friend and I each got one for a recent Disney trip. Her battery life lasted 4-6 hours of moderate use while mine lasted a full day. Not sure if there was a difference in the product or what, but that was somewhat disappointing. However, it charges quickly, and was not a big problem to use a portable charger or to charge it back at the hotel. At home, I use it for my skincare. Overall, a really good purchase for the money!",

I purchased this for my recent Disneyland trip(Mid August) and it worked great! I used it for majority of the day while I was in and out of the park. I was able to charge it in the car and in our hotel room. My kiddos were able to use it as well and it was very manageable for them. I was able to store it in my fannie pack or diaper bag, purse or stroller. I will be getting another for my kiddos to have there own for our next trip to Disney World.",
