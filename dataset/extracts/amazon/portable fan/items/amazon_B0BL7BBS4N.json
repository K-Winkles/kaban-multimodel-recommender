                "reviewText": "I bought this for a recent trip to Disneyland, temps were supposed to be between 80 and 90 and I thought a fan might help. My main complaint is I specifically bought it because I have long hair and it said it didn\u2019t pull hair - this is absolutely untrue, my hair got caught in it multiple times and it hurt. As long as I used it with my hair pulled back in a ponytail, it worked great. As other reviewers said, if it gets hotter out, the air it blows is less cool, so it\u2019s less useful. But overall we enjoyed using it and it was helpful, I just didn\u2019t like my hair getting pulled!",

                "reviewText": "I made this purchase after seeing a lady with one on thinking it was headphones. Imagine my surprise when she said it was a neck fan. First let me say I am not a fan of the heat. I purchase two, one for myself and one for my brother, for an upcoming trip in August. All I can say it was by far the best impulse purchase I've ever made. We were in the Carribean for 9 days and it was very hot and humid. The fan made a light humming sound, enough to know it's working, but not loud enough to be irritating. The air comes out on one side, but you can comfortably face it upwards to blow towards your face, or turn it downwards to blow on your chest. Either way it was wonderful. The battery life was wonderful and lasted all day into the night. Although I did not have it on all day and night. I used it enough that if the battery life was weak I would have known. One thing to note, the heat got to one of our traveling companions and we placed both fans around her neck and it cooled her off enough to get her back to the boat. I would gladly repurchase this item if needed and definitely recommend. It was not heavy at all around your neck. Definitely would recommend this neck fan.",
