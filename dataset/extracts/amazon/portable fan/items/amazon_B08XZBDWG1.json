I'm an outside person, mow my yard every week sometimes twice so I wrap a wet hand towel around my neck. I can wear this right over my towel with no problem. Really keeps me cool.

My daughter uses yours daily and really likes it. I haven't used mine at work yet but have used it when I was mowing the grass. It definitely provides sufficient airflow to cool you off. I only used it on the lowest speed and that was enough for the over 90deg temps while I was mowing. It was a little heavier than I expected but nothing extreme and it didn't really bother me after a while. It was noisier than I expected but again, I usually wear a headphone when I'm using it so it wasn't that big of a deal. The one thing I really like about the product is that you can adjust the arms. This allowed me to direct the airflow where I wanted. The drawback to that is that there is no airflow on the back of your neck but if you have long hair and leave it down that might be a not good thing anyway. Anyway, I liked this enough that I will be buying them for others I know who work in a hot environment.",

                "reviewText": "This fan is LIFE!! I\u2019m not prone to giving false compliments, so believe me when I say you NEED this fan. I\u2019ve bought 3. My husband wears his while cutting the grass or working outside. We live in a southern Hot & Humid area and these are perfect at keeping your body temperature cool in miserable hot conditions. I do sports photography, and I wear mine while standing for hours at a time in the blazing sun taking pictures. Bought one for my sister in law who likes to walk in the park and hike. USB rechargeable . The charge lasts a long time and is so much better than replacing batteries. The quality of construction is there as well. Easy to store in the outside pocket of a backpack. Great gift also.",

                "reviewText": "Initial Review Jan 13, 2022I've had a form of claustrophobia for over 20 years. For each person with this phobia it can be different. For example I have no problem being in an elevator. For me it's all about being concerned that I won't be able to breathe. I know this is all psychological but there it is and I've not been able to improve on my fear. That is what I bought this neck fan for.I have a specific use in mind. For about a year I've been taking pilot lessons to fly planes. The one I've been training in has some space around me and there is a window I can slide open. No problem for my claustrophobia. But I can't remain confined to just that one airplane. The next airplane I hope to fly is more confining, and there is no window. Just sitting in the driver's seat parked on the ground triggers my phobia and I have to open the door or get out of the airplane. I'm hoping this neck fan will help.If I can feel air blowing around my face I expect I will be much more comfortable. It's worth a try. For that use I have some concerns.1) I hope the fan is not electrically noisy which might cause static sounds in the communication system.2) As I'm not using this to cool off it actually might be too cold. It's winter now and in the 40s to 50s each flight (no heat to speak of in the airplane).All of this will be sorted out in the next few weeks when I'll check it out in a real situation.In the mean time this is a nice looking, if a bit large, neck fan. It is a little adjustable so I can move the air flow closer or further from my face. The design and fabrication is smooth; nothing to cause scratching or discomfort. The lowest setting might be best for me as it stays on for 5 seconds, then off for five seconds. This way it might not be too cold.Of course it may be really appreciated during our hot summers. I'm thinking of wearing it as I do yard work to help keep me cool.Pros:- The design makes it feel comfortable around me neck.- 5 fan speeds- Smooth exterior. No sharp points- Long run timesCons:- I would like it to blow more on my face and less on my neck and cheeks. The fins at the air delivery holes are actually designed to guide air away from the face and more onto the neck.- I was surprised how much noise the fan makes. It's not loud but I expected it to be silent on the lowest setting.- The on/off/speed button is form fitting on the right side. There is no way I can find and push the button because it is so smooth and level with the surface of the fan. It would help if there was a braille type raised dot or two.I will return here to update my review after I try this neck fan in the airplane.",

It\u2019s not completely silent, I can hear a gentle buzz, but nobody around me has been bothered by it. Charge lasts about 6-8 hours running continuously. Quite honestly, this is the best product that I have purchased on Amazon this year. I couldn\u2019t recommend it more highly.",
