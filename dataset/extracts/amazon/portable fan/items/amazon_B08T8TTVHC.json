I really love that I can charge it up and the battery lasts and lasts! I had purchased another small fan last year but it only works if plugged into a USB port so it's very limited. (It works great on my desk though! LOL)I'm so happy with this purchase and would recommend it!",

It provides a little breeze on my face as i do the dishes, or cook so i don't have to fire up the central ac. It's tiny and foldable (lending itself to several different applications) and it propels the air at 3 different strengths. It's nice to have it charged up and ready to use if the power goes out on warm days. In fact, if it lasts for a year, i may buy another.2 week update:It continues to get high marks for looks; perky yellow is cute as a bug's ear. However, i've barely used it (under 2 hours of total operation to date) and it needs re-charging already. (Oh, and that's with having charged it for a full 8 hour overnight out of the box.) So to all those reviewers claiming it runs for hours and hours on one charge: NOT-- at least that's not my finding. However, when it is charged (or plugged in) it offers good relief in my kitchen.",

When we travel, I always miss the fan. Not any more! This fan is slim, so it's very easy to pack; the battery life is amazing, it lasts the entire night and then some; the noise level is minimal; and the variable speeds are a great convenience. I've also used it at other times, and it's great. I can't think of a single negative thing about this fan. Great product at a surprisingly low price.",
