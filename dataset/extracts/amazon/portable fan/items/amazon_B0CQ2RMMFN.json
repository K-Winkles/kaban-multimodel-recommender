                "reviewText": "Not often found in small fans like this is a variable speed mode where the fan will change speeds simulating a natural wind environment. It\u2019s interesting to have but not totally natural because it still feels a bit mechanical in its timing and speed.I like that this fan has an extra long battery life. That allows me to use it for camping and not worry about losing power any time soon. I also attach it to my treadmill to keep me cool as I exercise.It feels very high quality with a nice finish to it. The fan noise is minimal, even on the highest speed. For the size of the fan, it does put out a fair amount of air and is relatively quiet.The twisty legs work best when wrapped around something although they will work albeit a little wobbly sometimes as a tripod stand. I do like that it\u2019s easy to remove the legs with button release and pull. In that way, you can use the fan without the legs although not as stable. It does make it easier for recharging without having to move and adjust the legs again.There is even a night light feature with a simple white light or pulsating colors. I didn\u2019t see a way to have just one color except for warm white.",

                "reviewText": "I really wish this had been around when my kids were stroller age! It would have come in handy at the zoo during those super hot/humid days of the summer.The fan is a bit bigger than I expected, but I don't think any wee fingers can get through to the fan blades. The area where there is a gap is away from the blades on the backside. I got my 10 year old with tiny fingers to mess around with it. The tip of her pointer finger was able to slip a little in but not near the blades (which were not going, of course). That's why I took off one star in case I'm misjudging baby fingers.There aren't any instructions but it's pretty easy to figure out. The nightlight comes on if you hold down the power button; the fan speeds change with quick clicks of the power button. Cleaning it is easy. The front cover locks on nicely and is in no way obviously going to open (so don't worry about your kids doing that easily). I had to look on the item page to see how to open it after failing for a few minutes.The recharger is a usb. Mine came already charged pretty well. I left it going for a few hours after receiving it, and it still has juice.The tentacle-like things that attach the fan to the stroller work really, really well and are pretty strong. I had it hanging on a paper towel pole on my fridge above the garbage can for several hours, and it did not shift or fall.Honestly, this is one of those things that you'd get at a baby shower and not realize just how wonderful it was.",

                "reviewText": "This portable stroller fan works well and the rechargeable battery lasts for a long time between charges. There are 4 fan speeds, but I can't really tell the difference between the \"soft wind\" and \"natural wind\" speeds. The night light is a nice feature and it is easy to switch between the 2 color modes. I like that the base is detachable and the tripod is easy to position although it is a bit cumbersome when using on a desk or flat surface. The fan, base and usb cable are packed nicely in the box with the instructions which are easy to read and understand. Overall this is a very nice portable fan for home or stroller use.",

                "reviewText": "I was immediately impressed by the solid build of this little fan. It just feels well made, not your typical cheapo plastic fan.The battery life is impressive, fan sound is minimal, the design and build quality is very good. Still getting used to the curly legs but haven't run into a scenario where they didn't work. I don't have little ones but if I did, I'd be much assured they would not get in trouble sticking their fingers into the cage.If you like quality things and need a small versatile fan, this is the one to get. Love the purple!",

I\u2019m easily able to manipulate the legs to wrap around the stroller or sit on a table. The fan has a good weight to it, and it feels solid. I like the fact that it has LED indicator lights to show me how much battery life is left while using it. I also really like that this is rechargeable! This fan comes with a cord, but you\u2019ll need to provide a charging block. There are four fan settings to adjust to your needs, and I like the fact that there\u2019s LED lights. There are two lighting modes: White or multicolor. This is nice to use as a nightlight as well. Overall, I feel this is a nice light with great fan modes, lighting modes, and easy to take anywhere!",

                "reviewText": "This portable fan can really put out some wind power and the fan is also quiet. The air flow can be adjusted easily from a soft wind to strong wind depending how much air flow I\u2019m looking for. I used this fan on my treadmill to cool myself down while exercising and the strong wind does help a lot. The fan can be rotated and adjusted so it points at the correct angle that will help get the most air flow. This fan has a big battery which lasts longer than other fans that I have tried and the fan can be easily recharged with the USB cable. The LED in the back let me know battery life but I much prefer a digital display as it\u2019s more intuitive for me. The legs can easily be bended to grab onto rails to make it stable or create a stable base for the fan to sit on my computer desk.",

If you hold the button down it allows you to choose rainbow light or white light. This makes a great night light as well as a fan. The coolest thing about this fan is how you can pop off the top and use it without the stand. So far I haven't found a need to do that, but it's awesome that you can. It's relatively lightweight and runs for many hours on a single charge. Definitely highly recommend!",
