                "reviewText": "Are you tired of sweating like you\u2019re in a sauna every time you sit at your desk? Enter the JZCreater USB Desk Fan, the superhero of compact cooling! This mini fan is like a pocket-sized polar vortex, but without the snow or frostbite.Let me tell you, I was initially skeptical about a fan that weighs less than my pet rock, but this little dynamo blew me away\u2014literally! First off, its 'exquisite design' is like a futuristic space pod that NASA forgot to launch. It's so sleek and stylish; I half expected it to transform into a tiny robot but alas, it only transforms hot air into a refreshing breeze.And the noise level? Quieter than a mime in a library! Seriously, it's quieter than a cricket trying to tiptoe. At its highest speed, it's as hushed as a secret, ensuring that my workmates don\u2019t mistake me for a helicopter pilot during conference calls.The three-speed setting is a game-changer. Low, medium, high\u2014choose your adventure! I personally call them 'Gentle Zephyr,' 'Moderate Breeze,' and 'Wind Tunnel.' And get this: it has a 'self-checking function.' Apparently, this fan is smarter than I am; it runs a 2-second diagnostic test to make sure it\u2019s feeling fit and fab before cooling you down.Now, let\u2019s talk about its compatibility. It's so USB-powered that I'm pretty sure it dreams in binary code. Plugging it into my laptop or a USB charger is as easy as pie. And for those worried about dirty fan blades, fear not! Cleaning is a breeze; just pop off the front cover, give it a wipe, and voil\u00e0\u2014good as new.However, a small word of caution: It doesn't have a battery, so if you dream of being a portable wind wizard, you'll need a power source nearby. But hey, if it had a battery, it might just fly away like Mary Poppins!In conclusion, the JZCreater USB Desk Fan is a fantastic invention. It cools, it's quiet, and it looks so good that it might just steal the spotlight from your favorite desk plant. Say goodbye to sweaty days and hello to a cool, refreshing breeze with this little marvel!Disclaimer: No, it doesn\u2019t actually transform into a tiny robot. But one can dream, right?",

I tested it using a standard USB outlet before we departed and it worked as advertised. When we finally were setup in our cabin I used it the first the night and it worked well and continued to use it for 6 nights with no issues. Please keep in mind this is very small, but for my needs, it works well and is very easy to pack. I plan on using this on all my \"getaways\".",
