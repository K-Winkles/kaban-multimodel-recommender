I currently use it at work for the times they refuse to turn the AC on and this little product has served me well over the past few weeks. It's quiet. I will note - if you turn the force up higher than 3 it'll get noisy and 5 oscillates between all different speeds, I don't like this option. I don't go/need to go higher than 2 which is a compliment to this product. The fan doesn't need to be plugged in to operate (rechargeable) which is always nice. If you looking for a compact desk fan for work or home office I would recommend. It has no use in any other setting that I can think of currently. Recommended.",
