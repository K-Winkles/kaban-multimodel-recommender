                "reviewText": "I bought two different styles of fans when I was flying with my two pugs in August. This model won for the versatility of battery and positioning. When the plane takes off and lands you must unplug any power cords, so having a battery option is important because those seem to be the most stressful/hot times. The USB option is a great backup option to save battery life. I used one set of batteries for two flights from Seattle to KC and the battery still had a charge.I was trying out two different dog carriers and I was able to position this fan with ease on both carriers, which was helpful. The position I found most useful was hanging the fan off the net on the back of the seat but the arms made it easy to hang from the bag as well.The fan was a little noisy at home but was not an issue over the noise of the plane. The fan is not super tiny, but I was able to fit it in my carry-on bag, so overall worth it.If you are thinking about a dog carrier - I have a standard Delta TSA-approved carrier (the brindle pug is sitting in) and a Snoozer rolling backpack carrier. My pugs are 17 pounds. The Snoozer pug carrier has great visibility and front ventilation when under the seat and it is nice that you can roll it or wear it. I found it very easy to use a fan with this carrier. The Large fits under the window seat and larger middle seats toward the front of the plane on Alaska, but my guess is the medium fits under all seats. The Delta bag is terrible unless your dog likes being trapped in a cave lol. I shoved the fan inside the bag and was not worried about my dog hurting himself, the blades are well protected.Anyway, I hope this is useful for anyone traveling with pets. I am sure it works great for babies too haha.",

It wraps really easily without an sliding down the metal bar. I installed a bar beside my bathroom mirror for my hair clips and it\u2019s a perfect spot to attach this little fan! Really happy with the purchase. Came precharged so I can use it right away. Just arrived today after ordering it this morning. The box arrived damaged so that wouldn\u2019t have been good for a gift, but it was fine since it was just for my own use.",
