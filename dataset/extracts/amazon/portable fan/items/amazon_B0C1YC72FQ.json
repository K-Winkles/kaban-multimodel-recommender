Very quiet for the amount of air it moves. Can be turned on silent mode so it doesn't make any beeps when turning it off and on or adjusting it's speed. Has 8 speeds. 6 was just right for us, for white noise and airflow. The remote was a must have to not have to get out of bed a dozen times a night and works excellent. Only had it one day so don't know about it's longevity.",

The instructions are easy to follow and I keep it at one and it\u2019sPerfect for a good night sleep with cool air.It\u2019s so silent that sometimes I forget it\u2019s even on.I haven\u2019t cleaned it yet since it\u2019sStill new so IHope it\u2019s not too difficult to clean but I\u2019ll write an update when I do that.

I also liked the multiple fan settings, and how quiet it ran on levels 1-3. That worked fine. And then...I pressed the button to have it oscillate. It turned to the left, and then it stopped forever. Everything went dark. I tried plugging in to a different socket. Tried every button on the thing. It was like it severed a wire or something? It never started to turn back to the right. So, it's getting returned and I'm on the hunt again for a quiet desk fan.",
