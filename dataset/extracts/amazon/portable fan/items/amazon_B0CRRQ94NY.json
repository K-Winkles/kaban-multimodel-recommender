It's also handy for travel or outdoor adventures where access to power outlets may be limited.Overall, I highly recommend this Portable Clip-on Fan to any parent looking for a convenient and effective way to keep their baby cool and comfortable while on the go.

When you camp as much as I do, you can deal with pretty much anything but... When you're cold, you can add a blanket or three, but when you're feeling overheated after you've gotten into the shade, standing in a breeze, but no cool water to jump into, there's not much you can do besides suffer. This little fan is a big help. This one is small enough to put almost anywhere, it has an aligateroid clip to attach it to something in your tent, and a loop to hang it up prop it up, so you can put it almost anywhere. And it's powerful enough to cover a much larger area than you think. I can see stretching out for a nap on a hot afternoon, and angling it to cover my entire body. Very good value.",

                "reviewText": "I got several of these fans to use while working out at the gym and overall these fans work well. They have a very small footprint and charge pretty quickly. They are very portable and compact in size and the battery lasts well beyond my normal 2 hour workouts. I like that I can clip the fan to the treadmill or elliptical machine and the clip rotates 360 degrees or I can also easily slip it into my pocket while I move between weight machines. It also has a flat base so you can place and position it however you want on any flat surface. My only criticism is that the spring clip is a little small so you will be limited in what it can be clipped to. Also the stream of air that this fan produces is pretty narrow due to its small size. Overall I like the fan but I wish it had slightly larger fan blades to produce a wider path of air but other than that I am quite happy with it. It should also come in very handy while travelling and on vacation.",

I like that I can charge it and use it anywhere I want, it have 3 settings you just need to press on the button once or twice or three times in order to change the settings.I didn\u2019t like the clip because it was very hard to press it or clip it on anything but I liked that I can just put it to stand on any surface.Pretty good fan for the size and it\u2019s also very quiet.",

I sleep with a fan blowing on me so I am always changing out fans. Many are larger and take up a lot of space. It is much nicer to fine a smaller fan with more power and this one can compete.",
