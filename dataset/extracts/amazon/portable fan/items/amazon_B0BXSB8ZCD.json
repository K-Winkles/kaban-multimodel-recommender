Otlonpe Desk Fan adopts 2 modes of battery and USB power supply. Battery power mode can last 6-15H. When powered by USB, USB desk fan can work continuously. Battery powered is designed for outdoor & travel, USB powered is used for Home & office. Why are you willing to choose otlonpe battery desk fan? 1. Smaller than other battery fans, more portable; 2. Stronger winds and longer battery life than other portable fans (hand fans, neck fans); 3. Flexible for indoor and outdoor use (USB desk fans can only be used indoors)",

The stand pulls out and it\u2019s balanced. Snap it back and it\u2019s perfect to pack if you are traveling. It will recharge with a battery pack if there is no power. I love this fan.. So now I\u2019m forwarding info to my daughter who lives in Texas. Last summer was too much.. she will love having this on her nightstand .. she will sleep. I strongly recommend this small fan. And the price is very good , too.",

So glad I can across this one. it has both USB and USB-C but this use the UBS-C for charging or as the port to use with a wall plug. The charge last long - I had this tiny but mighty fan going on high power nearly 8 hours before it died without a charge. Oh and cooling action - it definitely works for cooling you down. It\u2019s got three settings and all move air well. Sound wise it\u2019s not the most quiet fan but if you need sound or air moving to sleep - it will meet both these needs. It\u2019s light weight and I appreciate that is fold and has a stand that\u2019s adjustable. I\u2019m ordering a few more to send to my family back home so they too can keep cool.",

Love that it\u2019s rechargeable and doesn\u2019t need to be plugged in just for it to work. I like the speeds but 3 seems a little to loud for the office environment so I might just keep it at 1.
