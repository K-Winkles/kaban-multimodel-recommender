It\u2019s makes barely any noise so you don\u2019t have to worry about the super annoying noise. This fan is compact and foldable so it can fit in an average size purse, or bag! Great for doing skin care or going out on a hot day! Great battery life, USB-C charge compatible. (I am currently using a Nintendo switch charger till I can find the charger it came with.\ud83d\ude02) This fan comes with a charger and detachable lanyard like attachment. (Super easy to attach and detach!) It shows the charge whenever you\u2019re not changing the setting, so no need to worry about not knowing. One of the only things I\u2019ll say otherwise is I wish it had one more setting that was even faster. Other than that it\u2019s perfect! I would totally recommend this to friends and family, perfect for any vacation, concert, walk in the park, etc\u2026.!",

I am a family of four and we fought for the fan! We were on a tour and everyone asked where she got it. I was surprised at how long it lasts after a full charge. I don't find it loud at all and it is strong for a hand held fan. I'll be getting a couple of more in the future. I think this would make a cute gift for a friend who is traveling or a teen.
