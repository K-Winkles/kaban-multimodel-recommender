Battery life was the same for all the other versions but what made this one the best was that it was the most lightweight, the least fussy (one button), strong fan compare to others, and the blades were covered so didn\u2019t hit my face/safer for kids. The other fans with exposed blades didn\u2019t really hurt too much if it hit you but you couldn\u2019t hold them under your shirt or close to your hair. This one was compact and safer and more versatile. Definitely the one we used the most and will be purchasing again.",

                "reviewText": "Kept this fan in my hand right up to my face while I was head banging and boy was that a game changer. It looks small and it is, but it was powerful on the high setting. It lasted me 5+ hours and then I charged the fan right off of my portable battery for the night shows. Since the festival, I keep it in my makeup bag and use it for my eyelashes and setting my makeup in general and it's great. Only downside is the button is easy to press if it is in a bag and it will just start running if something else hits the button until you go back in and turn it off. The button is just a little sensitive. Love it tho and bought it for all my rave girlies.",

I love the slim design because it fits well in a pocket or in my purse. The lanyard feature is also a plus because I have the option to wear it around my neck. This fan is a lot more powerful than I thought it would be and kept me cool in the summer heat. The only downside to this fan is the battery life. It only lasted about 2 hours for me before I had to charge it. If the battery lasted longer, this fan would be perfect!",

                "reviewText": "These fans are the perfect accessory for a hot summer park visit. I have tried the cooling towels and this is a much better option. The cooling towels don't say cool for long in the hot Florida sun. These fans are very light weight, small, and the battery lasts pretty long. The main downside of these fans is they will need to be recharged at night, and the button is pretty sensitive so if it goes off in your bag this can run the battery down. Overall, well worth the money, and they come with a lanyard which makes them easy to cary around your neck.",

I used it at a festival and never ran out of battery so I'm not sure how long it lasts but its plenty. It's also very lightweight and slim.Only down side is the power button protrudes out of the fan and is easily hit when in your bag so you'll often feel the fan turn on or not realize it has been running for a while.",
