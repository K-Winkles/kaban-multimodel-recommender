                "reviewText": "I recently received the RNKRUN Portable Hanging Neck Fan, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed with its design and functionality. This mini fan has become my go-to cooling device, especially during the scorching heat when I need to attend my kids' games.One of the standout features of this neck fan is its thoughtful design. The perfectly placed space on the side allows for the string to go through comfortably, ensuring a secure and comfortable fit around the neck. This feature is not only practical but also adds to the overall modern and stylish appearance of the device.The lightweight construction of the RNKRUN Portable Hanging Neck Fan makes it easy to wear for extended periods without any discomfort. I found it incredibly convenient to carry around, and it has become an essential part of my outdoor activities.The fan offers three adjustable speed settings, which is exactly what I needed for my various activities. Whether I'm just sitting and watching my kids' games or engaging in physical activities myself, I can easily adjust the fan's speed to suit my cooling needs.The only minor suggestion I have for improvement is the addition of a battery indicator. While the fan can be charged conveniently via USB, having a battery indicator would be even more helpful. It would enable me to keep track of the battery level and know when it needs to be charged in advance.",

                "reviewText": "I live in South Florida where the temperature sometimes reaches about 100 degrees Fahrenheit, which can be extremely hot. This little hanging neck fan has made the situation a bit less uncomfortable for me. I like that it is very slim and weightless, and the blowing aims directly at my neck and chin, somehow reaching my face as well. It makes a difference, as I can cope with the heat for a longer time and stay without sweating. The blowing is fairly good, and the device itself is well-made and looks stylish, with a nice color too. I don't think this is a solution for extremely hot weather, but it certainly helps. I recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice, little fan. I like that you can charge it using a USB-C charger, though I am concerned as the instructions read to not leave it on the charger after it has been fully charged (or else battery could be impacted) because it isn't always possible to monitor that closely. I like that it has a lanyard that you can adjust to determine how closely you want it to your head. It also includes a small stand that is helpful to direct the air. The battery lasts longer than I had expected. I have also used it while putting on makeup as one of the product pictures depicts. I have not tried the aromatherapy element to it yet so can't comment on that. Overall, I recommend this fan.",
