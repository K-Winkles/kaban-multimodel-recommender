                "reviewText": "I ordered this because our baby is due during the hottest summer months, and based on my experience with previous children, I realize how warm they can become in the stroller during those hot summer months. I wanted to be prepared ahead of time with something I always wished I had with my other kids, so I ordered this fan.I was pleased with the size, first of all. It's a small size, but has the ability to move a lot of air! Especially with the three speed settings. Even the lowest setting enough for our needs. Plenty of air movement to cool down a fair sized area.The fan overall felt very durable as well. The legs were surprisingly gripped and while the legs were somewhat hard to bend, I felt that to be a good thing. Less chance they'll move from their intended position once wrapped around the stroller bars. I purchased a fan like this before that slipped from position all the time because of this issue. I don't see that being a problem with this fan.Overall, very happy. Looking forward to using it this summer with our little one.",

                "reviewText": "This fan is pretty good. It's super quiet and while it isn't going to make a huge breeze, for its size I think it does a good job. I like the tripod legs- they're long enough, strong enough, and grippy enough to be versatile.I bought two fans from two different Amazon shops, but it turns out they're the same brand (judging from the boxes). I like the other one better because this one doesn't tell you how much charge is left. Knowing if it's close to needing to be recharged is important so you don't get caught out in the heat. The price difference between the two fans is less than five dollars. As such, even though I like this fan, it isn't my first choice. I prefer the one that displays the remaining battery.",
