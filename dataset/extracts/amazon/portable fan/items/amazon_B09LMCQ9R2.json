I am happy he is using it because it also acts as a back up charger for his phone which is a huge plus for this fan!_____________________________________________________ORIGINAL POSTI bought this fan for a European trip since I found that the last time I did a Euro trip most of the places that I stayed in didn\u2019t have air conditioning or even a fan. I am so glad that I did since we were hit by a heat wave while there. My family laughed and made fun when I said I was going to bring the fan with me but they weren\u2019t laughing when we were there! They were begging to use the fan. This thing was powerful, lasted for hours, was easy to pack and was easy to keep charged. I enjoyed having it so much that as soon as I got back home I ordered another one. I highly recommend this fan!",

                "reviewText": "I live in California, which can occasionally mean rolling brownouts or blackouts. I wanted to add a third rechargeable fan to my stable, but one that, unlike my other two, was very lightweight and easy to carry around. It is made of plastic. It has a handle at the top for carrying that also has a two-setting horizontal light (the second setting is very bright and covers a wide area). It is turned on/off independently of the fan.The fan itself has four levels of wind intensity. It cycles separately with an indicator light for the 1st to 3rd settings and the highest setting displays all three lights at once. The higher the setting, the less battery time. The setting you choose last will be remembered the next time you turn it on, depending on which method you used to turn the fan off (see below).You can set a timer of one, three, or five hours for the fan runtime by tapping the button to the left of the power button on the bottom right of the fan. I use that when it's hot at night to set it to one hour, or when I'm walking around and get distracted and don't return for a while.To turn the fan off, you can press and hold the power button on the lower right for a few seconds until it shuts off. This will retain your last fan setting. To turn it off without retaining the last fan setting, tap the power button several times until it shuts off. The light also has a long press capability, but it doesn't retain the high setting.On the lower back there is a USB C 5V 2A (10 watts) input to charge the fan. There is also a 5V 2A output for charging devices, like cell phones.I carry it from room to room, setting it on the counter, table, or floor, depending on my needs. I'm a little bit clumsy so I have accidentally kicked it when walking by. This sometimes causes the fan's front blade cover to pop off. To put it back on make sure that the name in the center of that front piece is right side up and turn it slightly to the left. There are two notches at the top of the exposed fan back piece. Align the front piece with the shorter height notch then twist it to the right to align with the longer notch to snap it in place.It's been cooler than expected at this time of year (July/August) but works quite well to cool me down when it does get hot and/or humid. I mostly use it at the lower setting and raise it when the combination of the heat from my second floor pushes through to the first, and/or when the heat/humidity outside warrants it. I turn it to a higher setting when I am prepping and washing clothes on the second floor, which gets a lot of sun. There's basically no cross draft available, due to the buildings on either side, and the direct sun in the afternoon that strikes the upstairs. I think the longest stretch of time I've used it is seven hours on the lowest fan setting. I only had to use the light once when we had a one hour brownout.The width is 9 1/2 inches, the height is 12 inches, the depth at its widest is 2 1/2 inches. The sound level at the lowest setting is quiet enough for me to use it as white noise for sleeping. It does get louder the higher the fan setting. The breeze from the highest setting is very good. I typically have it sitting on the floor with the fan centerpiece itself, which is adjustable vertically, tilted \"too clicks\" upward, so it reaches my legs and upper body. If it's particularly warm or humid, I set it on the table and focus it on my upper body/face.",

It\u2019s light weight enough to easily move around, and I usually put it on the shelf over my head at night so I have a nice cool breeze on me. Bonus points for the beautiful sage color, which perfectly matches the decor in my pretty little tiny home.",

Once charged it will run on the low setting for more than 2 days, providing a nice breeze for the desk or sleeping. Minimal noise and has a shutoff timer.The lights are a little bright, easy to cover with a sticker or tape. The charger input could be more convenient but works fine and charges up in a few hours.I ended up buying a second one for my house and have recommended it to my friends here as well. This makes all the difference trying to sleep when the power is knocked out or outside use like in the tent.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this fan because I MUST sleep with a fan. I hate fan noise, but I live with night sweats and hot flashes...ugh. So I used to have a great travel fan from Vornado (which I loved), but I mistakenly brought it with me to Europe and fried it in the 240v outlet without thinking. So when I replaced it, I got a USB/battery powered fan so that wouldn't happen again.This fan puts out a lot of air, and the battery life is sufficient for the night, but you can always plug it in to a battery bank if you're worried.I had to use electrical tape to cover the lights. While they're helpful indicators, I can't sleep (especially when I'm jet-lagged) with a dot of light coming from the nightstand directly in my eyes.The only reason I gave traveling 4 starts instead of 5 is because it's a little too large to be billed as \"travel\" (imho), and the frame is not square, so it takes up more room than I would like. But it is relatively light, though, and avoids the whole voltage conversion and plug adapter issue. So overall I would recommend it as a travel fan.",
