                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I purchased this for my bedside table, particularly to help with warm summer nights and hot flashes. I keep it plugged in at the wall outlet.I wanted a fan that was, small, light, quiet, low cost and not 'step through' (i.e. where you keep pressing the button to get to a higher level). With this one, you turn the knob to turn it ON and then keep turning it for a higher speed and then do the reverse to turn it off. My only complaint is when you turn it off and on it makes a 'click' -- I would prefer it it was 'clickless', but it doesn't seem to wake up my husband.I generally keep it on the lowest speed, which is enough breeze and quiet. (Not silent, but quiet enough).It's very light that I can easily reposition it with one hand from my bed. It tilts up and down (angles) but doesn't oscillate. (You need 2 hands to tilt it, but I leave it in one position).It's 6\" top to bottom and folds up. (Actual fan part is 5\")I purchased 5 fans of all prices to see which one fit the bill and this one came out on top. It's not the most sexy looking thing, but it works great for my needs.",

                "reviewText": "Being so light/low mass, the fans benefit from some form of 'anchoring'. I use 'gummy dots' ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B098JBSGDX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1 ) as a simple-to-remove-when-needed solution, to hold them in place. Nine speed settings; although the speed knob is a bit awkward for access. I noticed the noise of the one I located to blow air on me while sleeping; located about 18 inches north of my head, and about ten inches higher. Oddly, rather than primarily hearing it directly, I mostly notice it through bone conduction - THROUGH my pillow! I went to some trouble to verify this as actually being the case, since, to do so, the 'noise' must travel through the the gummy 'feet', the little plastic crate I'm using to elevate the fan, the shelving the crate sits on (the crate being secured in place by a 15 lb. lead shot weight I placed inside it), the floor, and then up through the bed frame, the mattresses, and, finally, my pillow. Go figure. The other one is located on my desk. I noticed the noise from this one, too; and decided to measure it - with a professional db meter that I own (more accurate/sensitive than a phone app). I was surprised at the numbers that came up. I measured at a 24\" distance, with the air flow passing ~ 3 inches above the meter. I had to turn off all the other fans that I have about the place (nine 20\" box fans, all set to slower-than-normal speeds, via Variacs [continuously variably autoformers]), to keep air circulating in my 3500 sq. ft. (downtown storefront) facility. I also had to wait between traffic passing out front, as the meter easily registers such; even with the door closed securely. Then... I had to hold my breath for each reading, as the meter also would register the sound of my breathing, about ten inches to the rear of it. Once all that was accomplished, I took several readings at each of the nine speed settings, then, averaged them. Speed 1 came in at only 40 db; which is normally allocated as being the quietest whisper one can hear; although I once measured a friend of mine hearing me whisper at a three feet distance - at 37 db! (each 3 db change up/down is twice as loud/soft) Each increment in increasing speed elevated the noise level by roughly 1 db per speed bump; such that, at the (ninth) max speed setting, the noise was 49 db. Still respectably quiet. The noise is definitely from the 'motor', though; not the air flow - as one might alternatively,/reasonably expect from, say, one of the aforementioned 20\" box fans. Box fans use (quieter) synchronous motors, whereas these fans - basically computer fans in a different physical configuration - are 'brushless' motors (synchronous motors are brushless, also, however); and use PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to control the motor's speed; the pulses being generated and controlled by a small IC within the motor housing, and usually fed to four poles/windings. The rotor is usually composed of a cheap, sintered magnet, cast in a ring form (or, sometimes, a low-flux NIB [Neodymium Iron Boron 'super magnet']). This results in a low level 'burring' sound - the sound I've been noticing. Ah, well. Recommended, nonetheless. :-)",
