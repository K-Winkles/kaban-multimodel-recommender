                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. If you're heading into vanlife, you might be considering the pricey built-in 12v fan that rotates in all 3 dimensions. This is by far the better option in my opinion. You get more for your money than the pricey fan at a much better priceLightweight - keeping your van's conversion weight down is important for gas mileage, and every bit counts.Battery option - you can unplug the fan so you can use that 12v socket for another piece of equipment.Mobile - nice to be able to move the fan from the bedroom to the desk or kitchen.Mounting - use the very strong clip to mount to a shelf or tabletop. The bottom of the clip is flat with rubber feet, so you can take the fan and set it on your desk or table without it budging.Fan - high-powered. I rarely use anything than the lowest setting.The unit is medium-high duty plastic, so the motion is a little stiff. Hasn't bothered me. Battery lasts about a day. It took me a minute to figure out the control button - it's on the back, almost flush with the surface, and you press it multiple times to cycle thru the speeds to the off position. I use it on low, then press it four times to turn it off.",
