                "reviewText": "This is a great little fan. Most neck fans like this are battery powered and roughly the same cost. The fan has 3 speeds, is lightweight, barely audible, and lasts all day.I work in sunny California and during the summer it gets HOT. I've had a few of my coworkers test out the fan and now they're fighting over who gets to use it! One of the ladies in my office is what we call a 'runner'. She is constantly driving to multiple businesses to drop off paperwork. She knows many other runners that do similar work. The fan was the talk of all the runners last week as they are all using single speed battery powered fans. My coworker amazed them all with the 3 modes (which is a lot more powerful than the battery powered ones) and ability to charge the fan with a USB port while driving between offices. Another nice feature is that the fan head pivots. This allows you to place it on a desk and aim the fan at you.Overall, for the price you cannot find a better option for a small portable fan.However, I do have some suggestions that would help for future developments!1. Put the brand name on the fan! -- everyone who tried the fan was asked what the brand was and where to get one!2. It would be nice to have more color options such as blue, red, and white.3. Charge level indicator lights -- It would be nice to see how much battery life the fan has left.4. Rubber clips for the necklace -- when you're walking briskly the metal brackets make noise, if they were rubber or something softer they would be quiet. We also had a problem with one of the buckles not always closing. I added a little oil and it closed just fine.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this fan for Disney. I\u2019m a redhead, extremely pale and burn easily so I bought sun proof long sleeve shirts to wear to Disney World in late June. If I hadn\u2019t had this fan, I would have been absolutely miserable. I love it so much I\u2019ve recommended it to others and four of them bought one as well. It\u2019s lightweight, fairly quiet, the neck strap can be adjusted and there are three fan speeds. It can be worn around your neck, handheld or placed on a flat surface. I wore this all day everyday and recharged it when I went to bed at night. It never died. It was perfect until it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m not exactly sure what happened, maybe a loose string got in it, but one of the blades broke four days into my eight day trip. I was able to pull the broken blade out with tweezers and it did continue to work, but I can no longer adjust the angle of the fan without it making a horrible sound and vibrating like crazy. The vibration caused the zipper on my backpack to jingle which was very annoying and when I take it off to place on a table it hops around. It still works, but I\u2019m disappointed because I loved this thing. It was great for walking outdoors in Missouri summer heat. So all in all it\u2019s a good buy. Just be careful not to have loose strings or anything near it that may get stuck in the blades.",

Again, my only negative would be better color choices for lomg term wear to not stick out so much but as I said, I do like mint green. My daughter likea to wear it too. Shes 8.I can not handle the heat! I also have Roseca and so I can't get overheated. I have a huge family gathering coming up and needed something to keep my face cool while interacting outdoors in the heat for a handful of hours! This item came quick and I immediately charged it up. I was dealing with the kiddos so I can't say how long that took. I noticed that there was a little indicator light to say \"hey, I am charged!\". I put it around my neck and fidgeted with it and setting one was a nice cool breeze, setting two is actually pretty powerful and setting three was as if I was in the car with the AC blowing full speed! I settled on setting 2 while getting some chores done that overheat me. I also took it outside while getting some gasoline to test it outside in the heat. It did keep my face cool while I was boiling everywhere else! It does what it sets out to do! adjustable, can hang from the neck so it is handsfree, has 3 settings that I was shocked really worked well, and I can recharge it! I didn't want a battery-operated one. I haven't charged it back up yet but I haven't tested the many hours per setting it states. That will be tested this next Saturday! I will update if it worked out for me. so far, all seems in order! my only complaint would be the color choices. I do like a nice mint green, but it sticks out like a sore thumb and I looked like a tourist in my own gas station! hahaha",

I have purchased several more for friends who also LOVE this product. It is very light weight and conveniently serves as a table/desk top fan, hand held, and (most useful of all) hung around neck with so many possible positions.IF YOU NEED/WANT A LIGHTWEIGHT, POWERFUL FAN...This is the one to buy...a bargain at any price, but even better for under $20,",

                "reviewText": "I have very long hair and even if I tie it back my neck, face and head get really hot very quickly in the sun. Those little hand held fans are useless but thus fan is certainly a giant step up from that and you still have two hands free for shopping etc. Maybe the neck cord could be slightly longer so that the fan gives a wider cooling area and is not so in your face - 2 more inches each side would be ideal; particularly when you could then adjust the distance from your face according to the different speeds. You would also have more of the air reaching your neck which even at full stretch unless you have the fan at full pelt not much air gets to your neck. So many more benefits with a simple adjustment to the strap. I don't know how long it will last and I have no idea yet at how long it will last before the power runs out. The fact you charge it via a USB is also a huge plus for me. Even if this just lasted me one summer I would not be unhappy at having to replace it once a year.",
