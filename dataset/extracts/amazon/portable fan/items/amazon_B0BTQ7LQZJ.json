                "reviewText": "Electrician here. This is a powerful little fan. The blades are small; but, they spin fast. There are goods and bads though. On the good side, the fan is powerful (said that already). Even on low, one can feel the air. It's also very attractive. It's a good looking piece of equipment with a modern design and aesthetic appearance. The cord is long too. That's a helpful feature. The rubber \"feet\" are effective. It won't slide around the desktop or vibrate to make additional racket. Which brings me to the bad: It IS noisy. I assumed, with the \"Sharper Image\" brand name, it would be almost silent. It is not. Besides the sound of the wind being forced through the housing (which is considerable), the motor hums audibly. Obviously, this hum is directly proportional to the setting (low, medium, or high). Since it is a desktop fan (more on that in a moment), the sound might disturb one's work or interfere with audio communications. At the very least, it would make one turn up the volumes of other sounds to which one would be listening. As it is a desktop fan, there is only one angle of direction. FOR the desk, the angle is perfect. One cannot place it atop a tall file cabinet and point it down at oneself though. One cannot point it ANY other direction than the direction it points.I started this review with four stars. I figured, at the asking price, it is definitely worth it. Still, with the noise and the inability to adjust the angle, the product becomes average at best. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great value and a great fan. It's just a little noisy and positionally fixed.",

It's great for a cool breeze while working at the desk, and it takes up space that wouldn't otherwise be used productively. There's only so many bins of easter candy one person can sanely have on their desk, after all.It has more power than the USB-powered fans I've replaced with it, but it's still quiet and subtle on the desk. I generally use the lowest speed, but even at medium speed I barely notice the sound.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this fan! I imagine anyone who finds themselves at a desk or cubical for much of the day, especially within the proximity of others, is going to absolutely love this fan. I am a teacher, and am naturally always on the warmer side - it doesn't help that my class isn't super well insulated! However, since my classroom isn't huge, whenever I use a bigger fan, then my students say it's too cold, and there is never a balance. This fan solves it, because it has enough horsepower to keep me cool regardless of the temperature, it is small enough that others aren't bothered by the gust of wind it produces. It has three settings, a high, medium, and low setting, and if my class just came from outside, I'll enjoy the high setting before switching to the medium setting to keep me cool as I do paperwork. When I'm in a meeting or on the phone, the low setting is quiet enough but still gives me some circulation. The silicone legs keep it from sliding off my desk, which is another great feature.",

                "reviewText": "I've owned desk fans for decades. I work better with a little bit of air flow. Trouble is, the noise can be a distraction. In addition, they occupy precious real estate and must look professional.I opened this Sharper Image fan box yesterday and was immediately surprised. I expected an acceptable fan, but wasn't prepared to be impressed. It's built extremely solid, it's minimalist, yet highly effective while being whisper quiet (on the low setting).It's a well conceived design, executed with quality materials, which simply performs as it should. It doesn't vibrate, rattle, or whistle. It's got heft, without being bulky. The switch is simple and effective. It looks uncluttered and dignified.The volume of air it moves is surprising for its size, yet, it's not pushing a wall of air past you that would make hearing conversations or calls a problem. I don't imagine using it would be perceptible over calls or video chats either, which is saying something.Based on a couple hours usage, I'd highly recommend this fan. It's a simple tool, done better. Just like you'd expect.Two thumbs up.",

Whenever she gets one of these, she immediately needs a fan to help cool her off.This fan has worked out great for when she sits in her recliner to read or to watch a movie. The base of the fan fits into the cup holder of her recliner, so it\u2019s right there when she needs it without having to get up. It\u2019s great for portability, and it would be perfect for a nightstand as well.The fan is is fairly light and the fins are so close together that she can just place it in her lap or hold it in her hand while running it - there\u2019s no danger of her fingers poking through any of the fins.The fan also runs very quietly on low and medium speeds, so if we\u2019re watching a movie, we don\u2019t even hear the fan. Plus, she can easily direct it onto only her without chilling me off.This is really a well designed and well made portable fan that provides plenty of air movement for instant relief.",
