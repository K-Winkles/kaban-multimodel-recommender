                "reviewText": "So I'm writing this review early to inform anyone who had been searching fan after fan as I have for awhile now. Normally I wait about a month to write a review to get good usage out of an item but it's only been a few days since for this Hurricane fan. I recently purchased a small Vornado that claimed 50 ft for less than $40 and thought perfect just what I need. Nope. Other than the highest setting every setting below that is very weak, Laughably so. The lowest doesn't seem to really do anything. The high is okay but 50 ft is more like 5-10ft. This Hurricane 16\" fan was cheaper than its\"12 fan for some reason and a few dollars cheaper than the Vornado and the quality is a night and day difference. It feels as if the lowest setting on this fan is faster than the Vornado highest setting. (Vornado Duo Small tower). I did read reviews that say the taller tower is better but I didn't wanna spend double the price. I'm so happy I bought this 16 inch fan that I purchased another yesterday because I couldn't believe how much air it pushed out. It was pushing more than my Honeywells which I have quite a few different ones from the table top, air movers (Vornado competitors) and large stand. I had a box that fit the fan perfectly so I didn't hang it and it would stay straight so that I could use it next to the portable AC to push air across a room. Again, made a night and day difference compared to every fan I had and mentioned. I bought this specific one because the CFM was higher than Hurricanes other fans (with stands) and many other fans I looked at in general. I was looking for power more than actual convenience or care for noise level as it is hot in the Deep South. On a side note, this fan is very heavy and the instructions basically show one picture of how to put it together but it must've taken me a minute or two to do it. It's pretty easy and a bit of common sense once you look at it, it's the heaviness that may be more of an issue which is why I was glad I happened to have a box that was capable of actually holding it without moving. I didn't need the Oscillating feature for the first one, just a straight shot. And as I said fan noise wasn't a concern as long as it pushed air and this fan, at least for me wasn't that loud. It's as loud as you might think a strong fan would be but since it's across the room and I have many other fans plus the portable AC it's not an issue whatsoever.I can't recommend this fan enough, if it's power you're after and at an amazing price then this is it.Highly recommended!",

After installing the new fan, and really taking a good look at the whole fan, the speed selector switch is definitely the weak point. I opened up the small panel that houses the electronics, and the selector switch is just a piece of plastic attached to another piece of plastic that goes into a small hole in the control board. If it was metal, I wouldn't have had a problem with the first fan. Overall this fan is easy to install, moves air very well and is about as loud as your average cheap oscillating fan. The all metal body and metal fans are very nice. Fan oscillates well. I really wish the selector lever was all metal too! This fan is heavy duty except for that part... and the selector switch is something the end user will manipulate every time its used. Company sent a replacement fan immediately, so I can't be too upset. Once you get the wall plate on, swapping fans is trivial.",
