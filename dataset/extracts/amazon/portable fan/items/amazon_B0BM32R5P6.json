They lasted 8 hours on high! We never used the lights on them though.They are small but powerful. Plenty of air flow and low noise. I had battery packs with me to charge them for the second night and they charged fully. I would recommend them for sure.Only weird thing was I bought 4 different colors and though they each had their own box and charger, every one of the boxes was marked that it was the orange fan. But inside the boxes was the correct colors that I had ordered.",

I had one previous from another company and this one is far the best one that I've had the battery is excellent on it and it even has a light on top of it that does the job. Especially if you have any power outages or anything. Anybody that's looking to get a nice portable and reliable fan. This one is definitely good and the price isn't bad. Whoever made this product could have easily charged more for this, but the price is very very good. The fan does good as far as blowing the air and also the light has three settings on it. Bright, medium light and less light. But overall the fan is definitely good. If I ever need another one I definitely will buy another one one of these. I've taken this fan to Kenya with me because I needed it so that whenever I'm in my hotel or wherever I go I can have my fan with me and it always came in handy and it never let me down.",

This little device has quickly become my constant companion, providing a refreshing breeze wherever I go.First and foremost, the fan's portability is a game-changer. It's incredibly compact and lightweight, making it easy to carry in my bag or even slip into my pocket. Whether I'm commuting to work, hiking, or lounging at the beach, I can conveniently take it with me everywhere. The sturdy construction ensures it can withstand the rigors of daily use without any issues.The fan's performance is impressive. Despite its small size, it generates a surprisingly powerful airflow that instantly cools me down. The adjustable speed settings allow me to customize the airflow according to my preferences.",

                "reviewText": "This is an incredible fan. I bought one just to see how it would do because we went from RV camping to tent camping this summer (RV got hit by semi and totaled) and this fan/light combo is great. I don\u2019t give out super wonderful excellent reviews easily when it comes to fans because I\u2019m a post menopausal woman and I have to have air circulation when I sleep, LOL. It is super quiet, you barely hear anything when it\u2019s on. You can put it on any setting you want and it lasts for a really long time. The setting aspect of this fan is actually pretty cool where it\u2019s not low medium or high you move the knob and it changes with the knob movement so it\u2019s very, variable and it\u2019s nice. The light is great like you could really have that light up high or on a lower setting and it does a great job of lighting up the entire tent. There is a hook on the bottom but when it\u2019s folded over it lays completely flat so you could set it on a surface or you could hang it upside down very easily either way. The tilt of the fan is great it\u2019s not just \u201cclick first position, click last position\u201d you can adjust it into any position that you want and it stays. The higher the fan speed the quicker the battery will die, but I had it set probably at medium and in the morning it was still growing strong and still had battery life and I was getting good air circulation. It comes with a recharging cord but does not come with a block so if you have a or USP Port you\u2019re great other than that you\u2019re gonna have to find a block to be able to plug it in and recharge it. Love this fan so much bought a second one so I could just have it for myself and my husband has the other one. Great product! If I had to put a downside on this I will say when all the lights are out the lights on the fan that indicate speed or battery light to be honest I don\u2019t remember are pretty bright but I actually took a Band-Aid out of our first aid kit and taped a Band-Aid over it and didn\u2019t have that issue anymore so that\u2019s the only negative I could tell you about the fan.",
