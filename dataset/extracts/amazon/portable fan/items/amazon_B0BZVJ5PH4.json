It is not too loud. The color changing LED lights on the sides are a neat touch, but you can turn that feature off if you want to.I wore this to two different outdoor concerts in the Texas heat and it kept me comfortable. I got a lot of questions about where I got it. All of those people dying from heat wished that they had one.It seems to last several hours on one charge. When you do have to charge it, it charges quickly.Overall it is well made, works great, and is a good value. I ended up buying a second one.",

The fan is small and portable, and comes with a USB cable to plug into a power source. The fan has a flexible neck that allowed it to be adjusted to the desired angle, making it very convenient.My stepson wore the fan underneath her costume and it was a lifesaver! The fan kept him cool and comfortable during a long day of trick-or-treating. He was able to stay in costume the whole time without getting too hot and sweaty. When he removed his costume the fan was so quiet and comfortable he forgot he was wearing it.",

                "reviewText": "I am always hot and sweaty especially when I am working on my furniture business and I saw this little gem on TikTok and needed one right away, this one was similar and better price so I bought it. It certainly helps me stay cool and is GREAT for hot flashes. It has 3 fan settings and the middle one works well for me, but the only downside is the battery life isn\u2019t that great. I was doing a furniture project and it died within the hour. Maybe I got a lemon? I would buy this again and I might give my sister one as a gift. I do not use the lights on it but they are pretty cool. Also, watch your hair if it\u2019s longer. My hair is only a medium length and if the fan shifts my hair sometimes gets stuck in it but not to the point I have to cut it off. I like this and might also get a second one for me",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I love this fan so much that I bought a second one to leave at work. It is quite powerful and still very quiet. It has three fan settings (low, medium, high) and two light settings (disco or blue). I use it intermittently and find that one charge will last several days.The low/med settings are very effective and still quiet enough for normal conversation/activities. The highest setting is quite a lil breeze and loud enough to be noticeable, but I find the lower settings to be more than enough. Also the disco lights are a big crowd pleaser if you decide to turn them on.I\u2019ve tried the wrap around neck fans as well, and while they are less obtrusive, they are also FAR less effective than this guy. This is an excellent product for the price, and a must have for any women going through The Change.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this fan for our trip to Walt Disney World. I knew we would be going during the middle of the summer and the temperature in Florida was going to be extreme. Overall, it's not a bad fan. It was a little louder than I was expecting when running, but I was thankful for the air it provided. It did give off a pretty decent amount of air when running. However, I deducted two stars because it died pretty quickly after using it for maybe 30 minutes. Thankfully we had recharging packs and were able to recharge it while in the park. The biggest downfall that I would warn consumers about is that if you or your kids have long hair (DO NOT BUY THIS FAN). even if you plan on pulling your hair into a ponytail. We had a terrible mishap during the parade where my 9-year-old's hair was entangled into the fan blades. We had to cut off the fan and S-L-O-W-L-Y try to unwind my child's hair from the blades. I wouldn't recommend it if your kids have long hair, it's too much of a risk in my opinion.",
