If you accidentally get in the way while it's running, the blades it will stop immediately as a safety precaution, but the blades are soft plastic and it doesn't hurt.Small enough to fit it my purse, quiet enough for the movie theater, I am super happy with this purchase.

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. It is getting to be that time of year where fans are essential to staying cool. I looked into quite a few handheld fans and was \"blown away,\" by this one (pun intended) so much that I bought a second one so I can share when I'm out and about with friends or family!This fan has amazing features, and I did a full video review for you to see it in action. For those of you who don't have time to listen to the video or those might be hearing impaired, I'll type the overall narrative of the video as well. \ud83d\ude42\u2022 Feature #1: Fan- This fan can be used both by holding it, and folding it back and sitting it on a flat surface like a table fan which is so convenient.- The fan has 3 speed settings in the order of low, medium, then high, and pushing the button a 4th time will turn off the fan.- I'd say this little fan comes packed with power and cools you off pretty well.- The fan blades are made of a hard plastic, so it does hurt if you accidentally get hit by them more than the cheap fans with foam blades would. The only dislike I have is that if you accidentally hit the blades, the fan stops versus the cheaper fans you find with foam blades just start back up again.Feature #2: Powerbank- So I have a pretty powerful power bank (I strongly recommend people invest in a good one) that I always keep charged and doubt I will have to use this as a powerbank. It does work as a powerbank, but it will charge your phone pretty slow, and may possibly die before the phone finishes charging - don't hold me to that though as I have not tested it. It could work in a pinch though to save you from your phone dying. For comparison, when I plugged my phone to charge with the powerbank, it was going to take my phone 3.5 hours to charge for having 9% battery versus my phone using original plug in charger and having a \"fast charge,\" in 1.5 hours. Mind you, that is from the charging cord that came with the fan.- You can only use the USB port to charge your device. If you have a 2 sided type c cable, that won't work.Feature #3: Flashlight- If you hold down the power button, it will turn on the flashlight at the bottom of the fan. You hold the button down again to turn it off.- I have found 2 ways to use it: one with the fan completely closed, and one with the fan open to make a wider light. Both work pretty well, thought the option with the fan closed seems to be just a little brighter.I hope this review is helpful, and I hope you all enjoy this fan as much as I did!",

                "reviewText": "This is the greatest portable little fan ever! First off, it\u2019s cute. Second, the fact that it also has flashlight and a portable charger is simply fantastic. I bought this along with several other portable fans for a recent trip to Japan (it was 95+ the whole time) and only this one ended up making the cut. It fit perfectly in the pocket of my backpack and it went everywhere with me. While it didn\u2019t keep me super cool due to it being so incredibly hot, it did keep me from being super sweaty and that in itself kept me sane. Charger portion works great! Even after all day use, still had enough battery to charge my phone and my mom\u2019s. The flashlight is bright and easy to use. Durability is good as I dropped it several times and it still works. It is a bit on the louder side when on high but it didn\u2019t bother anyone around me. It\u2019s also on the heavier side for a portable fan but with all it\u2019s factors, I can overlook it. Overall, one of my favorite purchases on amazon by far.",

Se me ha ca\u00eddo un par de veces y sigue intacto. La bater\u00eda dura mucho. Para apagarlo se pueden parar las aspas con la mano sin problemas. Al abrirlo si se tira hacia atr\u00e1s y se deja en \u00e1ngulo recto se sostiene solo.Como curiosidad comentar que la linterna tiene mucho alcance, no s\u00e9 decir pero seguro que llega a diez metros de distancia aunque no se que utilidad tiene algo as\u00ed en un ventilador pero bueno... Ah\u00ed est\u00e1. Y tambi\u00e9n decir que la linterna y el ventilador duran much\u00edsimas horas.",
