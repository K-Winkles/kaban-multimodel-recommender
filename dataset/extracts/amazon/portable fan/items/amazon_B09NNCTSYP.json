                "reviewText": "This fan is awesome! I visit WDW about 7 times a year and I take this with me to the parks every single time. I swear it has saved my life in the FL sweltering heat. I don't know how people can get by without it. The battery lasted the whole day and I ran this sucker on high most of the time, even when I went inside. It will cool you off a lot faster using it in the A/C when you've been sweating and are overheated. It folds so you can position it on a table in front of you which is especially nice when you are hot and you sit down to eat. It folds up all the way so it's easy to carry in a small bag and the back up battery is great to have if you forget to charge the battery overnight for the next day. I simply cannot be without this fan in the parks. It costs a little more than some of the others, but it is so worth it. I used this fan for 3 years and 4 months before I purchased another simply because over time the battery will lose its ability to hold a charge for long periods like with anything else that is rechargeable. That is to be expected. The original fan still works just fine and I use that one on the bathroom counter when I'm blow drying my hair so I don't sweat my makeup off!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered a bunch of small portable fans to figure out which one was the best. This fan was absolutely the winner! Yes it was the most expensive, but it is by far the best value. I have used this fan in our trailer, at home, in my vehicle, and even carry it in my backpack. I love that it has 2 batteries, so I always have a reliable phone charger and/or spare fan battery. The fan itself will run for the entire night on just 1 battery charge. I don't know how long it will run after a night, but was happy it never slowed down overnight. I find that the lowest speed is just right for sleeping or reading, and the higher speeds will cool you off quickly if needed. There are tinier fans, but they aren't as just perfect as this fan. I also like how it folds as a stand, and I use the little metal piece to hang it tilted on the wall and aimed at my face when we're camping in our trailer. This summer I was in extremely hot weather and having this fan gave me peace of mind knowing that I could survive if my vehicle had engine trouble. It is a great emergency fan! I got my family the black ones and I got a pink one so no one would take mine, ha!I feel this fan is durable, has a good cage around the blades so they don't get bent, good quality, and a worthwhile value. I am cheap when it comes to spending money so an item has to offer value for the price, and this fan does that. It surprised me how much I preferred this fan over the other ones I had bought to try out. I only got this one to try because of other reviews here, and they were surprisingly right. Give it a try, return it if you don't like it. That extra battery is handy though....",

I love that I don\u2019t need to keep replacing batteries! Just plug it into a USB and charge it back up. The fact that it comes with 2 battery packs (and they\u2019re already charged when this arrived!) is genius. It means you\u2019re never without one. 3 speeds so you are in control. And I love that the head bends so you can prop it up on a table and not have to hold it if you don\u2019t want to. This fan is perfect!",
