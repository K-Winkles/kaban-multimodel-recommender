The short time I tested it in my living room it felt 10x as strong compared to our $50+ standing fan.\u2b50\ufe0f NOISE: 5/5 for being quiet. It is not 100% silent but with how well it works and the price point I would expect it to be much louder.\u2b50\ufe0f LOOK: 5/5 for colorful lights, customization, and size.\u2b50\ufe0f OVERALL: 5/5. For the price alone with how good this fan works it is absolutely 5 stars. I cannot speak on anything long term as far and durability due to only having it for less than a week so far but if anything changes this review will be updated!",

I don\u2019t want lights on my fan, so I haven\u2019t used them and can\u2019t give any kind of review on that. However, my purpose in buying a remote control fan was because it was going in a difficult to reach place. So I\u2019m not overjoyed that the remote stopped working after 1 day, requiring me to do various contortions to check the fan. I know it\u2019s buyer beware and there\u2019s no way of knowing how old the battery is, etc, etc\u2026but it\u2019s annoying anyway.Update: The new batteries didn\u2019t help. I was able to contact the seller through Amazon, and requested a new remote. Today I received a whole new fan. Maybe they felt the problem was in the receiver for the remote and not the remote itself? Impressed with the customer service. Anyway, new fan is working fine, will be keeping my fingers crossed that the remote keeps working. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc10-27-22Further update\u2026the new remote also stopped working within just a few days. I appreciate that the company sent me a new fan, but maybe they should just concentrate on remaking a new and better remote. I guess I will give this fan to someone that doesn\u2019t need one with a remote and order a new - and different brand - fan.",

The lights are still working!!I loved this fan! I bought 3 more for family members. So quiet, great fan power, lightweight. After 8 days of use, the remote control quit working. I replaced the battery but, it still won\u2019t work. There are control buttons on the back of the fan, thank goodness. About a week later the light control button works about half the time, after I try a few times. No doubt that it will quit within a few days. I\u2019m so disappointed! It would be worth the money if it worked as it should \ud83d\ude14I\u2019m very surprised at the power of this little thing! It does have 3 speeds. I don\u2019t know how I missed it the first time. The low speed is a perfect breeze for close range such as a desk.",
