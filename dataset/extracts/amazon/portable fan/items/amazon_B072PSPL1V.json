Would not work with brand new batteries, would not work with the electric plug. I was really counting on this to use as part of our hurricane emergency kit, and of course at this point there are no battery operated fans in any of the stores in my area. As soon as storm passes and roads are safe I will be returning this. Do NOT order if you are really counting on a fan that will work right out of the box.UPDATE: I contacted the company who makes this fan and this is the reply I got from them:\"Our 8\" fans were discontinued about 3 to 4 years ago; therefore, Amazon had no other recourse but to honor the return. I am sure this was a mistake on Amazon's part, but we only carry 5\" and 10\" models of our fans.\"That was all they had to say about this product. Amazon gave me a shipping return label (THANKS)--I do not recommend ordering ANYTHING from the company who manufactured the fan.",
