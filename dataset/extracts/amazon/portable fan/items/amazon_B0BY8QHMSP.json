                "reviewText": "The Pluralla personal fan with the fixed fan blades behind a grid cage, I have found, is the best style of handheld fan if you're looking for effective wind/cooling speed & fairly quiet operation. This fan came with an 86% charge, easily viewable on the small digital screen, which is also where the fan speed number shows up. The power/speed increase button is located just under the digital screen. This fan advertises 5 speeds; in reality, there's only 4 that are useful. 1 being the lowest, 2 more speed, up to 4, which is highest. You'd think 5 would be fastest speed, but it isn't. It's, as far as I can figure out, a \"variable\" speed and goes from 1 to 2 to 1 to 3 to 1, etc. I don't know what use that will be b/c if I'm using a Hand Held Fan, I'm perfectly capable of adjusting the speed myself. So IMO, this 5th speed is a waste, I'm removing a star for that sillyness. This fan comes with an aroma-tablet in a sealed foil bag & there are instructions for proper insertion into the fan. No indication what the scent is, brand name or any way to order more if you want.You'll find a small stand for the fan so it will stand, upright, on it's own & there's a grove for your phone. Neat idea. The fan itself tilts back so you can fine tune the direction. There's also a lanyard included so you can wear the fan around your neck & enjoy it that way. It really is versatile. Another feature that makes this fixed blade behind a grid cage style more desirable is there's less chance of getting your hair caught in the blades. The collapsible fans even come with a warning sticker about getting hair caight in the fan blades. The charges on these last quite awhile & recharge via USB pretty quickly. This unit can also be used to charge your phone or another item w/a USB connection.I've tried a few different styles of handheld fans, looking for the one I like best & this style is the one to stick with. My favorite so far has 6 speeds, each increasingly stronger until #6, which feels comparable to a plug in fan.",

                "reviewText": "Came well packed and even the power button had a little cushion around it to avoid depression during transit.Nice fan, especially as its rechargeable. Although I haven\u2019t tried it, I understand that the USB C port is both input and OUTPUT for charging (input) AND alternatively for charging your phone at a pinch from the power storage in the fan battery.To that end there is also a little stand supplied so you can place the fan on a flat surface and, if charging your phone, there is a slot in the stand for holding it while charging.Regarding the current charge, the display provides LED readout of the charge level in percentage. (For the record mine came 81% full). It happens for a short time following each \u201cpower mode\u201d selection with the aforementioned button.In terms of function, it\u2019s easy to use. Each press of the power button provides the next level of fan speed and a short readout of level. There are 4 increasing levels and a fifth press will invoke a special mode which cycles through each of the 4 in quick succession with a couple of seconds between each: 1,2,3,4,1,2\u2026etc. You get the idea. If you do, let me know cos I\u2019m not sure what purpose this serves but hey, why not?The speeds are mild to strong so a good range for whatever you need at the time. A 2 second hold of the power button at any time (I think the instructions say 5) will power off the unit. Fan is comfortable to hold but has a lanyard which can be attached to each side of the fan and the fan can then be worn around the neck. Plus, since the fan head itself can move at 90 degrees from its base (essentially the handle) you can position the fan whilst hanging from your neck, to target you in different ways, neck, face etc. Hands free fanning. The lanyard fooled me for a while as to how to attach it before that aha moment when I realized that the 2 ends of the lanyard can be detached, tied to the fan and then reattached to the rest of the lanyard for easy attachment. Don\u2019t worry if that means nothing now, it\u2019ll be helpful at the time you do it. If you\u2019ve seen this type of lanyard before unlike me, you\u2019ll not need this.Instructions are not the greatest but not enough to take a star off and to be fair the seller got back to a question I had pretty quickly and suggested they were looking to improve some of the wording. The issue wasn\u2019t about the function because, well, there\u2019s not much to say about that. It was more to do with the use of the word \u2018accessories\u2019, the inclusion of a battery under that heading and the false impression it gave that a replacement rechargeable battery was available. It isn\u2019t. But that\u2019s fine.All in all a great fan for the coming summer!Hope you found this helpful!!",

It kicks out much more fan power than I was expecting, and helps quite a bit in cooling, especially for hot flashes.The stand holds it, so could be used at a desk. It does come with a strap making it hands free.There are five settings - four are increasing intensities, and the fifth setting runs through the previous 4 intervals. I do like how the display shows not only what setting you are on, but then displays the battery percentage.",
