The fan did not charge very well at all. I had to have the fan at a certain angle for a connection to be made for the charging cord and the charging port. Today I went to charge the fan as I\u2019m getting ready to go to camp tomorrow. I plugged the charging cord in and the light blinked then went out. When I took out the plug to see if something was asked the entire port mechanism came out with the charger. I\u2019m so disappointed because this coming week is going to be record high temperatures and I was hoping to be able to keep a little cool while walking from activity to activity. I also will put it on one of my campers if they are beginning to get overheated. I\u2019ll have to go back to paper fans to blow some of the heat away.",
