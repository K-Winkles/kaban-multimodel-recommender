We use it to cool off food before giving it to the kids. It gets used almost every meal. It lasts a really long time and is easy to charge. I'm actually on my second one because my daughter dropped the first one and broke it. It's surprisingly high quality for the price. The air flow from this fan is awesome. Would definitely recommend. It's also great for taking with you to travel. When you're stuck taxing on the runway in a hot airplane, there's nothing better than whipping out this handheld fan and getting your own personal little breeze.",

I'm surprised it lasted me an entire 3 weeks abroad without charging it once. it stopped working on my way back and just a few minutes of charging was enough to give it enough juice and its been working well for me even till today on that few minutes charge. i love this product and 100% recommend to anyone. small, portable, cute colors, and a great amount of wind to keep you cool during desperately hot times!",

                "reviewText": "My first impression when I bought the fan I thought how could this small fan really put out cold air. Boy, it sure surprised me! I bought this small hand held fan to help me with hot flashes. It has been a life saver for me. I also found it helpful to use when I go to places where it is hot and humid. I am able to place it inside my small purse or a coat pocket. It gives out a lot of power for being small. It comes in two speeds which I found helpful too. When I get a hot flash I use the higher speed to speed up the air and use the low for continuous use. The fan is not loud. It does come in many beautiful colors too. It doesn\u2019t take much to charge. It is light weight and easy to carry around.",

It ran out of battery while I was using it recently but I was able to plug it in and use it while it was charging, which was super convenient! The fan itself feels sturdy; I even once accidentally knocked the fan off my bathroom counter onto the hard floor and it did not have a single scratch on it. The strap is very nice as well.",
