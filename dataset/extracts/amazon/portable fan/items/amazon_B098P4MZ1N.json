Just wish it held more water, but that's not a huge issue. Also is nice that you can clip it, rotate it upside down and turn it 360\u00b0. All and all, it's a little pricey, but worth the money. The removable power bank is also a nice feature. You can take it off and use to charge other devices when need be. I am glad I purchased and it will get much use between golfing, working in a hot, non climate controlled environment, and even at the beach or pool. I highly recommend to just go ahead and purchase this fan for anyone who is on the fence. You won't be disappointed.",

After it sat unused for a couple weeks with clean, filtered tap water in it, it would not spray any mist. Turned fan upside down to drain the water out and a bunch of purplish goo poured out along with what looked to be some kind of fine fibers. Tried purging the system several times to no avail. Misting nozzle is not removable for cleaning, making the fan totally useless. I was so pissed at spending top dollar on something that failed after only a dozen uses that I just tossed it in the trash. Would definitely not recommend to anyone. Mick",
