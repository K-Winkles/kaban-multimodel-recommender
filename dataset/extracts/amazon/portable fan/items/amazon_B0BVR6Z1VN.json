                "reviewText": "I really like how this handheld fan looks. It's also great how compact and lightweight it is.For those that don't like vibration, this fan is really solid and has pretty low vibration. So you can hold it for long periods of time without your hands getting uncomfortable.However, the wind it produces is just too weak. The lower fan speeds just don't work well enough outside when you're walking around. You have to bring the fan really close to your face to really feel it. Basically, you have to use a higher fan speed for it to be effective. With a higher fan speed, it gets noisier too.Additionally, the wind it produces is very narrow, likely due to how small it is and the enclosed design it uses. So you need to aim it carefully.I also got the larger version of this and I feel like this smaller one is better overall.",

I know it\u2019s a small fan with a small blade but I expected better. They\u2019re also quite loud as well. For the amount of sound coming from it (I certainly wouldn\u2019t use it on public transport due to the noise) you expect a lot more. All things aside it\u2019s not a bad fan, it does the job, it looks pretty slick, it\u2019s lightweight, easy to carry around however if I was in the market again for another handheld fan I\u2019d probably look elsewhere.",
