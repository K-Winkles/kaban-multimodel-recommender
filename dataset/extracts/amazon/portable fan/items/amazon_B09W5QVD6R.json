Have you ever lost control of yourself when your beloved child sits in the backseat complaining about the heat and becomes irritable? We are here to help you out! Our designer figured out a solution to the dilemma that even though there\u2019s a fan blowing, the air is still hot. It's 5.4 inches and comes with 3 speeds for different purposes: powerful wind yet whisper-working. We add a water tank (50 ml capacity) on the top of the fan, and when the weather becomes unbearable, just turn on the misting function. It sprays for 5 minutes, then stops for 5 minutes and repeats for about 3 hours continuously, and the fan could work about 2/6/10H at 3 different speeds. All our products are brand new. It is normal that there may be some water drop left in the tank due to the misting function test before shipping. The input of this fan is 5V/1A; you could also charge it with a 5V/1A or 5V/2A adapter. To protect the battery, please unplug the cable while it is fully charged. Besides, please charge this fan once every month in order to maintain the service life of the product if it is not used for a long time. Note: Please unplug the power isolation tab before using the product. To avoid clogging the spray holes, be sure to add pure water to the container. For a better experience and proper spray function, it is recommended to keep the water tank on top when using the spray function. You can download product guides and documents for more product information.",

                "reviewText": "The multi speed fan works great. Powered by USB plug...and charges fast. What really rocks is the mist option. There is a water bottle. Fill it up and just put water in the reservoir. There is a separate water mist button and a very cool mist comes out. You don't have to use the fan with the mist. I liked using it separately so I could feel how well it worked. The legs are adjustable. The mist is pretty quiet. So you could use it in more of a stealth mode if needed. This fan has lights that change color when charging and fully charged. It is portable. Nice looking. And so so cool. I do not know how they get it so cool. Wow! Winner.",

                "reviewText": "We bought 2 of these and I love them! The fans can easily mount to anything! Charging makes it so easy to keep the battery up! The misting works great and those fan settings actually do something! It\u2019s so nice I can use it as a hand held fan as well!I took away 2 stars because I have spent multiple times re-tightening the small screws that attach the fan head to the legs. It\u2019s a pain because in order to fit my screw driver in, I have to take off the side screws for the head and then remove the fan head\u2026 all just to tighten the fan head base to the legs\u2026 but other than that they have worked perfectly! I would buy again, especially for the price!",
