                "reviewText": "I love this little fan! Bought it for a small bedroom. There is an attic entrance in the ceiling to my bedroom so I do not have the option to install a ceiling fan. Didn't want or need anything large that would take up floor place and get in the way. I just wanted something to move the air around and keep my bedroom from feeling stale. This fan is exactly what I needed. It moves a lot of air for its small size even on the low setting. It is small enough to fit inside the bottom shelf of my nightstand. You can hear it but it isn't loud or distracting. The outside shell is all metal and feels solid. The fan blades are clear abs plastic. The fan grills are spaced close enough to keep small objects and fingers from accidentally hitting the blades. The grills are also spaced wide enough to easily clean the fan blades off with compressed air. It looks very nice. Comes with a usb cord that I plugged into my surge protector. Works well. I highly recommend this fan and I would buy it again. The bronze version of this fan is perfect for Bohemian and other decor styles where modern plastic looking devices might stand out too much.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to use during power outages on hot summer days, but now I use it all the time. I was so impressed with the battery life and quietness that I bought a second one. Really convenient to store and charge. It doesn't rattle or rotate. I like that I can remove the grill to wipe off the blades. My only complaint is, if you're planning to use it while sleeping, the bright blue LED on the back interferes with sleeping. I had to cover the LED with a small piece of electrical tape. Overall, very happy with this little fan.",

                "reviewText": "This fan is 6\", as opposed to the typical 4\" ones at Wally World. I have a smaller 4\" one from another maker too.The color is bronze, not rose gold. There is no \"rose\". Its just a \"burnished\" gold....I stood some 10+ feet in front of it as it blew on high, and could still feel it blowing well. It has a low, off and high switch.My only complaint is that the blades are clear plastic instead of metal. I believe that the vibrating thin plastic is the reason for its loudness. I don't think the decibels are louder than the 4\" fan, but the sound is just a bit more abrasive with the plastic blades, if that makes sense.There really aren't too many quiet fans out there, so I wouldn't let the sound stop you from buying it. It gets the job done and is not a horrible sound. If you need a slightly larger fan, to say, sleep with....but your table is 6 feet away. This puppy will blow on you from that distance and you will feel comfortable.",

                "reviewText": "This fan has a physical rocker switch so you can leave it off or at low speed or high speed. It's not like these \"smart\" fans that reset to off when plugged in and you have to press a button to cycle through speeds. Once you've set the fan speed it will stay like that forever until you change the switch position yourself. That was my primary reason for buying it.The fan is large and well constructed. It's easy to disassemble if you need to clean or fix something which was a nice surprise.However the fan needs a lot of current. It claims it needs 54mA on the label and that's true at low speed, at high speed it's closer to 63mA. The inrush current is so high that it makes other devices plugged into my USB charger act like they just got plugged in when I turn the fan on because of the resulting voltage drop. I moved it to a better USB charger that can provide more current and now it doesn't have this problem. Be cautious about that.Because of that I would NOT recommend plugging this into a sensitive or expensive device with a USB port like a laptop, phone, game console, etc. Make sure it's plugged into something that can provide a lot of current.",
