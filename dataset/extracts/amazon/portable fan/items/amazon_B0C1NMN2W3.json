                "reviewText": "Bought this fan to have on hand while flying with my small dog. I placed the fan at my feet during our flights (2.5 and 3 hours) on the lowest setting just to be sure he didn't overheat. It worked great, but that was the extent of the battery life. After one 3 hour flight it wouldn't turn on and needed to be recharged. After that we recharged during every layover just to be safe. Other than that it worked great for what we needed it for.Other thing is the size, it's \"small\" but not necessarily \"compact.\"",

I like that it has three speeds. I love that it has a rechargeable battery as I never have batteries in the house anymore. Great gift for anyone expecting a baby!",
