                "reviewText": "I swear before Glob and the witnesses in this website that I have not been paid or coerced in any way to give this testimony. I paid for these fans with my old sweat-and-toil-earned money. So say we all.:BREAKING NEWS EDIT: You probably don't read instruction manuals just like I don't. The new version has a huge feature add. Instead of having to cycle through LOW, MED, HIGH to get to OFF...you can just hold down the button to go straight to off. YUSS!:END EDIT:I've been using these little HandFans for 5 or 6 years now (see old/new in my pic), and thought I just got lucky when my first one turned out to: 1) have long battery life, 2) put out an impressive amount of air, 3) run way more quiet than I expected. The fact that they've improved on the product is fantastic.I don't know what fan magic is going on, but this little fan has harnessed it. One of my V.1s had a little wobble/unevenitude, so I took off the front cover to add a little balance weight. Without that vortex front cover, the fan puts out exactly 0 airs. As in...none. Like most little fans in the world. Add that vortex back on, boom!...sittin' pretty. Try it...you'll be amazed.The new version has some nice improvements. The \"recharge your phone!\" stuff is interesting, but it's not why you'll want this. It's true, you can charge and it actually does a nice job. See screenshot...it's charging around 1000mA which is respectable, but no where near what your OEM quickcharge version can do. (OnePlus warp charge will do 2x-4x that.) The big payoff about the battery thing is that you can remove the fan and plug it into whatever USB you want. Use your nice Anker battery. Use an USB AC adapter. Whatever. Turns out to be a nice feature.The new version is still quiet, light, and uses the same (exact) fan mech. It's quiet enough on low to use in Church. I just drop the handle in my shirt pocket and angle the fan at my face...so nice. Same with a flight...handle in the seat pocket, angled up to my face. Plenty powerful enough. I haven't found a use for the little clip that comes with it and I never carry it with me, I could maybe you're more clever than I am.I also leave a few of these tucked into the pocket behind the seats in my car. Helps my passengers on hot days when the AC just isn't hitting them right.Anyway, this is the little portable fan you're looking for. Everyone that uses mine goes immediately to Amazam and orders a couple.Note: DO check for any unevenness on the blade, and use prime to send it back for another if it wobbles. It's only happened to me on one fan. The rest (including this new model) have been 100% balanced and perfect.",

Can't tell you how many times we have gone to my grandma's house, where she keeps her thermostat at like 85, and have busted these out and stayed completely cool! Plus, they use the same charger that my android phone uses, so they can be charged from pretty much anywhere (since most people have at least one of those chargers with them or in their homes). I ordered 3 of these and have already convinced multiple people to order them.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a fan for our trip to Morocco, Africa. I ended up on this one because of size and reviews. Price was nice too, but I would have paid more if it meant the difference between suffering and being comfortable. Luckily for me, this fan was shockingly effective!! So powerful, nicely made, recharging was quick, and during our two nights in the Sahara Desert, this plugged directly into a USB outlet which allowed me to have it on full blast the whole time, so worked awesome without the battery. On the bus rides, however, this powered through six-eight hour bus rides and only had one to two bars gone. WHAT!?! Battery life is amazing. It doesn\u2019t really hang well, but you can bend this 100 ways so that doesn\u2019t bother me a bit. I tucked it into the handle on the back of the seat and it worked perfect. I also took this on a cruise to have at night and when I dried my hair and this was a necessity. I can\u2019t say enough good things about it. They could easily double the asking price, but it\u2019s a steal. I don\u2019t go anywhere without this thing. I came to add another to my cart. An inexpensive yet effective product still exists? Thankfully, yes! Because sweating is the worst.",

I like the way the head can be angled for any type of use and I like the power of the fan. My Wife needs one of these fans for medical reasons and she finds that setting number one is more than suffcient for her needs. The size of the product is exactly right. Some other fans are too small to handle confidently. This product is most definitely top of the range in hand held fans. If you purchase one you will not be dissapointed.",
