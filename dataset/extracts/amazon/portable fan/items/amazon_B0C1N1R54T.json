                "reviewText": "TLDR: Compact desk fan - surprisingly powerful even on low settings, perfect for office use.This desk fan, despite its small size, packs a significant punch in air circulation. It's an ideal addition to my desk, especially on those warm, stuffy days in the office. Even on its lowest setting, it effectively moves air around, providing much-needed relief.The fan comes with three power settings, allowing for customization based on the day's temperature and stuffiness. The medium setting is my usual choice, efficiently circulating air around my head area and contributing to a cooler sensation.Another commendable aspect is the noise level. Even at its highest power, the fan is not overly loud. It's noticeable, but not disruptive, which is essential in an office environment. I rarely find the need to use it at full power, as the lower settings are sufficient for my needs.",

                "reviewText": "We took this on our cruise and it was a lifesaver! It was humid and hot and this fan helped so much. It\u2019s usb so our battery pack could run this so we could use it in the cabin or the balcony. We also like having a fan on at night and when you\u2019re hot getting out of the shower. This fan was great to have for traveling, so much so we got a second one. Highly recommend!! You can use this at home and your work desk, the car, etc. it\u2019s Fantastic, pun intended lol. The only thing we disliked was how bright the light is. It could light up the room so we had to put tape over it.The fan works sideways as well as right side up. We had it on its side to block the light with the cabin lamp. Noise wise this fan is pretty quiet. All 3 speeds were nice and circulated air nicely. Great fan, highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a travel fan and this one plugs into the USB port on my alarm clock. The three speeds are great for adjusting both the amount of air flow but also proportionally controls how loud it is and that is great for when you want both air and soothing sound at night. It's truly a comfort fan. Edit: The only issue I have, having used it for several months is that while the stand is fully controllable, if the stand you are using is higher than where you want the fan to blow, you have to use something to keep the fan from falling forward, the highest fan speed will help prevent this but only to a point. But...a variety of weighted objects placed on the back of the units stand will keep it in place, I use my car keys to keep it in place. But for most practical application the stand works great.",
