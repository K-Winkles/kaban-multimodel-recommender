Very powerful air flow and I ran it for almost 6 hours and it never lost more than 1 dot on the battery status. I haven't needed the light but its definitely better than the ones on the fans that I returned. The others had it like a spotlight and if you're using the fan then you'd be blinded by the flashlight. This one is nice and bright and on the back so it illuminates like a lantern more than a flashlight and wont be straight in your eyes. I've only had it a month, so hopefully it'll be just as good long term!",

                "reviewText": "Best rechargeable fan I've ever owned. This thing is POWERFUL. It does a better job of cooling me off than ever our ceiling fans. It has several settings and lasts nearly an entire day on high at Disney world. We would not have survived Disney in June without it lol. We attached it to the stroller and multiple times we ended up with a line of people behind us asking if they could \"soak up our air\" lol! It is a bit bulkier than some of the other rechargeable fans, but not much bigger than a pair of men's shoes. My only complaint is that the rubber part of the clamp broke after several days of use, making it very difficult to get it to stay attached to the stroller. Otherwise a year later, it's still going strong.",

I have had this fan for a year & a half now. It kicks out a large amount of air and light. It can be hung via clamp or hook, so good in a couple of different places for me. AND it holds a charge all night. I\u2019ve had fans that pushed a sufficient amount of air before but they lose power about 2:00 AM and that is just not enough. This little beast is my best camping friend!",

Battery life on highest setting does last me 11+ hr and it's not as loud. Only con compared to my 8\" round fan is that it's not 100% 360\u00b0 due to it not being able to turn in the direction of the clip (where you would mount it on) and in some cases that's the only place available due to the space. I've came across that already but I just shift the fan because I have enough room to swivel it in the direction towards the clip.",
