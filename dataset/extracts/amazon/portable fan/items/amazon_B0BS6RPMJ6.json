                "reviewText": "Item: \"HELIJIA Portable Folding Fan, 10000mAh Rechargeable Retractable USB Standing Fan, 4 Speed Ultra Quiet Adjustable Height and Head for Office Bedroom Outdoor Travel Camping Fishing (Black)\"~Battery life testing, with fan and no rotation:- High: 6.5 hours (low battery light came on after about 3.5)- Medium: 12 hours (low battery light came on after about 10)- Low: 22.5 hours (low battery light came on after about 21)- Charging: somewhere between 6.5 and 7.5 hoursIt's plenty powerful for me on the high setting - I don't feel like I need a higher one.The remote sometimes works all the way across my apartment, which is a little under 30 feet. Even when you're not very far away you have to be somewhat exact about pointing it at the small receiver part on the base, which isn't too much of an issue up close, but from a longer distance it tended to take quite a few tries. (But for realistic purposes, why would you be turning it on from 30 feet away anyway?)It would be nice if they'd put a dim dot of light on the receiver so you can tell where it is, for instance if you're using it at night when you're in bed and the lights are off... or even during the day, since it's the same color as the base and kind of blends in.I like that it folds down small when not in use. It's easy to pull it up to its full height, and to collapse it back down again. Don't forget to hold the little toggle switch to let it finish folding down into the base; it should fold easily without being forced at all.When it's extended to its full height, if you point the fan a little upwards (instead of a little down, or level with the ground) and put it on the highest setting, it tips over backwards. So if you want to use it like that it'll either have to lean back against something, or you'll need something like a bag of rice to set on the base.I wish the beeps for mode changes were silenceable. As an autistic person who's sensitive to sound, they hurt my ears. Using the remote and being further away helps somewhat.The fan itself isn't quieter or louder than a very old plug-in one that I have, but it has a slight electronic whining quality to it that makes it so I can hear it across my apartment while standing several feet from a closed door, when it's on the medium and high settings. If you're not sensitive to sound, maybe you won't be able to hear it like that... and the only reason I had it on in another room from me was to test the battery life overnight.Getting the fan cover off the first time took some effort and multiple angle attempts, but it was pretty easy to put it back on, and easy to take off again after the first time (it doesn't feel like it's going to fall off, though).I appreciate the ability to use its battery for charging a phone or other things, in case of a power outage. I probably won't use it for that during the summer, since I'll want to save the battery for the fan, but it could be nice as an extra backup battery in the winter.Overall, I'm happy with it, and I expect I'll sleep better in the summer this year than last year due to having it. :)",
