Now I use it for my baby in her stroller in the summer. But it\u2019s handy to have anywhere. Easy to use and adjustable. The charge lasts for awhile, I never time it to be honest but at least an hour, maybe more? Either way it charges quick. Uses a basic usb plug. It\u2019s not very loud at all, but I found the fan sound relaxing personally either way. I recommend. Great as a gift in my opinion.",

                "reviewText": "I got this for my peloton and it works great. I wrap it around the handle bar and it makes such a huge difference in my work outs. It's surprisingly strong - I personally wouldn't want it to be any stronger. I have found that I can work out harder when I'm staying cooler with a fan like this. It also has a light on it - I don't have any use for that but I could see it being helpful in some situations. I usually workout for 20-30 minutes and this fan can usually do 3-5 workouts before needing to be recharged. Maybe more - I just don't want to risk it dying on me while I'm working out. I just take it off to charge it and it's so easy to take off/put back on that it's not big deal. I definitely prefer this to one that plugs into the peloton - I just have concerns about plugging external devices into the peloton. So this one is perfect that it's battery operated!",

                "reviewText": "We've taken this fan all over the world and on several trips to Disney Parks, and it's holding up great. We love that it can easily attach to nearly any handlebar (perfect for the stroller) or that it can stand in a tripod position. Not only is it great for keeping my daughter cool, I use it too! I pack it in one of the exterior drink pockets on my carry-on bag and whip it out during boarding time on planes when the AC isn't running fully yet. I've used it in the UK as a table-side fan when our accommodation didn't have AC. I've also used it on a cruise when our AC quit working the first night. It's fantastic all around! I recommend it to all of my friends who have kids.",

The little legs are adjustable so you can wrap it around any bar on the stroller and position it as you\u2019d like. There are 3 different speeds on the fan, as well as a light. It comes with a charging cable as it\u2019s not battery operated but I found the charge lasted a very long time.I\u2019m very happy with this purchase and it was worth every penny. A must have in the summers and when traveling to warm destinations!",
