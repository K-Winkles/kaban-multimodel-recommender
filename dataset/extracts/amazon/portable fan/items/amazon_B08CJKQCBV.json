Although it comes with its own stand I think that should have made it rechargeable instead of just to hold it up right while it charges. Additionally, the battery life could be longer but it\u2019s not a big issue for me because I don\u2019t use it for anything but my lashes. However, if you plan to use this for some kind of outdoor summer event to keep cool. Expect to have it die on you at least halfway through.",
