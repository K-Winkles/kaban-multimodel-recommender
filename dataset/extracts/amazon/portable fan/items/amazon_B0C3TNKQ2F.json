                "reviewText": "I ordered 4 of these little fans in pink, dark blue, green and white. I gave this 5 stars because of the customer service! They reached out to me to see how my purchase went and if it a smooth process. I had a hiccup with the white fan, but customer service fixed that issue with no problems. With that being said It blows a decent amount of air, just enough to help in this massive amount of heat AL is having. The light is bright enough to find keys in your purse or what ever else you are looking for. The white fan light was too dim \ud83d\ude2d, but customer service for the company is currently helping me with that issue. I can't really speak on the battery life because i only use it a couple of hours at a time. It does take quite sometime to charge. If you want something light and compact this is the fan for you! I carry the pink one in my purse at all times. It doesn't take up space and it is very light weight, which is another reason I chose this mini handheld fan. I really liked the white one, but once my replacement gets here I will be very happy and I will carry the white one in my purse! It will go EVERYWHERE with me lol. Overall my purchase experience and interaction with the company customer service was above and beyond, 5 stars!!!!",
