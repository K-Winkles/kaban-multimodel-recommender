It is portable and rotates 360 degrees, making it ideal for any space or for taking on the go, such as on a camping or other trip.I bought this for my son to use with his gaming system. It can be plugged directly into the game to provide power. It is composed of plastic and is quite light, but it does not fall over when it's being used. My son is cleaning the inside with a straw brush because the blade portion does not separate for cleaning. He's using it at high speed, which allows for adequate airflow.All you have to do to get started is plug it in and turn it on. It performs admirably, offers multiple speeds, and is reasonably priced.",

I took a star off because I carried it in my pocket, and noticed when I got in that several of the plastic cage bars are broken. Not sure if I did that or if it came shipped that way (it's not noticeable when you push them back into place). Either way, it's not a good vote for durability.Summary: Not durable and has minor noise issues, but it blows air and keeps me cool at my desk job for cheap.",

But, I then considered the price I paid which was minimal. Be very aware of sizing when ordering. It is VERY SMALL. It is ranked lightweight because IT IS VERY SMALL. It does provide air in my office on my desk, but SMALL.",
