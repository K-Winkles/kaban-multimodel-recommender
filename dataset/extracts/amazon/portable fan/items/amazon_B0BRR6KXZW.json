The fan is excellent and does what it needs to do and moves air enough to cool down air on a hot day/night for a sleeping area. The battery lasts quite a long time and the different options to hanging it in a tent or sitting it on a counter makes it versatile. The fan does not weight a ton so could easily be packed in if it fell into a necessity.",

                "reviewText": "I'm doing a 5k mile road trip and camping for 30 days. I've been searching high and low for a good fan. I need one to be able to sleep, as well as move a fair bit of air to keep my tent cool as I get into much hotter climates. This fan has blown me away (unintended pun, but I'm keeping it lol). Not only is it surprisingly powerful for how compact it is, but the battery life is OUTSTANDING. I literally didn't even realize it was a USB-C charging fan. I thought it was another D battery one, so I was pleasantly surprised by the USB C charging port, and oh boy does this thing hold a big charge or what. It'll take you a whole to charge it up via AC if it's drained, but this fan can run on high for like 24 hours straight before it's drained, so if you're running it at night and can charge it during the day, you'll never have to deal with a dead fan. It can also continue to be turned on while charging, so if you're like me and have multiple power banks or a solar setup with an inverter / battery, this is a great combo.10/10 this fan is better than i ever could have hoped for. I'm seriously considering buying a second one lol.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased 2 of these for camping and for when the lights go out(which is a lot due to storms) and used them for the first time on a weekend long camping trip. One hung on the hook overhead and one we used on a makeshift nightstand. Only one was used to charge our phones and even though it's not a fast charge, it kept everything charged. The fan produces a good bit of air, but I do recommend the bigger your tent or area, the more you will want to buy. I have a 10 person tent and 2 did pretty decent in keeping it cool during the day. Fan that was hanging was kept on all day for 2 days(it got cold at night) and is still sitting at 75%. The one we used to charge everything also stayed on during the day and it's at 25% now. I will be charging both again for the inevitable power outage in our next storm and will be buying more.",

I think I charged my phone with it as well.Works well, only charged it once over a 3 day, two night camp out, as it was down to 25% after the first night. The fan ran all night, so that's to be expected.",

                "reviewText": "I live in Singapore, so average temperature is 27C or around 80F. I bought this for my office. I found that it's much better than fans multiple times the price (including my much bigger Dyson). The fan flow is huge and the battery lasts 2 weeks for me on full speed. I'm from Australia so my camping perspective on this is valid. I love camping and this fan is beyond what I thought was doable. It's a little larger than some others in the same price and market bracket but we'll worth it. The battery is awesome, the hanger on it is full sized so you wont get stuck mounting it and it swivels in every possible ditection which is a plus from som3 mounted competitors. I use it both hanging and on its stand on a table. This week my eldest has commandeered mine for his bedroom and I need to by another, his older (camping advertised) fan just isn't at the same level. This is completely worth it, I'm about to buy another.",
