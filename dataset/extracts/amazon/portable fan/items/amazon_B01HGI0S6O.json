                "reviewText": "My initial review was not so good. The device essentially failed when I took it on it's first trip (it's intended use). After returning from my trip, I wrote a scathing review on it's failure and on some potential issues this product would have including the hinge that seemed like it would break after repeated uses. Unfortunately, what failed was something with the switch that prevented the device from actually being used. I was unable to switch between the different speeds, and at times, would not even turn on. The company saw my review and immediately sent a replacement. It's been about a year now since I got the replacement and I now have real-world, long-term use on it. Here's my review...This fan has made it through the Spring humidity in Arlington, VA, camping from CA to WY, and numerous trips to Southern CA at Disneyland. It's intended use has exceeded my expectations. My concerns about the so-so build quality, the hinge, and the questionable electronics and battery have subsided. That being said, I still do have concerns about all these things, but after over a year (with reasonable care and transport) this product still has not failed. This is a great product, despite my concerns, as it does what it's intended to do... and does it well.Pros:* Has (3) speeds to choose from (Low, Medium, High).* Pushes a lot of air for it's size at all speed levels.* Compact (enough) to be stored easily.* Can be charged directly with any micro-USB cable.* Included battery is replaceable with any lithium 18650 battery when it eventually fails (average 18650 battery has about 300 full cycles/charges.)* Included battery will last at least a full day of on/off use (I have not tested continuous use time, but using it frequently throughout the day, lasted at least a full day.)* Reasonable on weight and would not be noticed in a bag, backpack, murse (man-purse), fanny pack, or hanging on a lanyard.* Customer service is great. They proactively reached out to me fix my issue. This is how true online services needs to be.Cons: (Note: These cons have not surfaced, therefore no stars were deducted.)* Build quality is questionable. Although, it is reasonable due to this price point.* Hinge longevity. Although I still question the durability of this hinge, after moderate use, I have not seen any issues, but it is still a concern.* Included lithium battery does not have a point/nub/nipple on the (+) side of the battery. Be mindful of reinstallation.* Charging status light can be a bit more obvious.Overall, despite my cons, this product has performed wonderfully. After a year of use, it's held up quite well. The overall performance, build quality, and features make this a quite a value at this price point. With this exceptionally hot weather we've been having the last few season has made considered purchasing more of this product. I would highly recommend this product.",
