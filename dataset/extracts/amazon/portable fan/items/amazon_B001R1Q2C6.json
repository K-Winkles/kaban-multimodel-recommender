                "reviewText": "Update: 8/15/20. I am updating this review because I noticed a burning smell. I saw some hair wrapped around the center bit, but after removing it, still having trouble getting the fan to spin at more than a low speed on the high setting, even with lube. Because of the design, I can't really get the whole thing apart without a lot of effort and breaking it. I've had this fan for three and a half years now, and inherited another three of these fans from my grandmother after her passing.The good: Nice strong air flow when they work. Price is nice and cheap. Usually low-maintenance. Very portable. Emergency in a room and you need a fan? This is nice, strong, easy to put in place.The bad: Lot of potential defects. They get noisy over time and something happened with my gran's fan where it won't stay in place and, because of the weighting, it just wants to point up at the ceiling.The ugly: Cleaning this thing is frustrating AF. A fan should be easy to take apart and not a pain to put back together, and you shouldn't have screws that were never designed to really come out. The blade cover design looks nice, but harder to scrub. If you need to do ANYTHING to fix a problem with the motor or whatever, just give up. For this reason, while I might one day buy one of these again as a spare, I'm going to stick with my other desk fan model, which, when it gets a problem, is easier to fix. It's a Lorell, and it's bigger than I'd like for this spot, but I'm just not down for more noise or trouble cleaning ATM. I continue to use this Honeywell model at work and in other areas of the house, and ~5 bucks a year for some annoyance is still pretty decent, but I don't have the spoons for this.tl;dr, get this model if you have short hair and need a strong backup fan, and don't mind replacing it whenever it starts annoying you, or if you just want a frugal fix. If you want something for a longer haul, something you can easily tinker back into top shape, opt for something else.The fan is quiet and works pretty well, but I did knock it over twice, and I'm not sure if that's what caused the blades to have trouble turning for some reason. Took it apart and applied tri-flow to the friction points with good, but not ideal results. I find it warms up if I mess with the settings a bit, and starts blowing strong, but that means in order to not have to do that every time, I have to keep it on.Four stars because this could be my fault, but also because it didn't fall far at all, and hit carpet.",

In the video it sounds a bit loud but it isn\u2019t all that loud (perfect white noise) The 3rd setting is my personal favorite because of the sound and how much air it produces. Also i was surprised to see that the cord was the perfect size to get from my desk to my outlet but overall 5 stars. If something happens to this one i will definitely buy another.",

I've place it in front of an open window, adjusted the fan it point upwards , and it circulates air really well in my living room. As a bonus, my cats don't mess with it! Good value for money.
