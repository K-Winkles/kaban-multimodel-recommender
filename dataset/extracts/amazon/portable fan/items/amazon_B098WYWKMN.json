                "reviewText": "For this thing's size it is incredibly powerful. You don't really notice it in the advertisements they should probably try to show it more but essentially it doesn't weigh much at all and you can essentially hold it from either end as you're walking and even though it's very powerful on the top setting, it doesn't shake, the speed is literally like double the RPM up I think it like 2,200 or 2,300 rounds per minute, which is really really good for this size of a fan in all honesty the way it sort of is more focused I get more out of this than I would one of those old school big box fans because it just doesn't seem to really do the same thing this is much more focused--the crazy thing is you can go out and spend literally like 30 or $35 on other camping fans and it's not going to be anywhere close to the size of the battery on this thing I've never even really gotten it down to the yellow zone, so I'm sure other people have done more testing and it probably says in the description but I've never even gotten it down to the yellow much less the red I think the Red zone means you got like maybe 2-3 hours left and then I think the yellow means you got like maybe 6-8 hours left or something, but that's what's crazy is I've used this thing for like three or four hours pretty much and never even really gotten it down even into the yellow zone so it's probably not the best review, since I'm not fully checked how long the battery lasts but all the other reviews seemed to be really really good and everything I have seen about it is fantastic except one little minor thing that it does kind of seem like it takes a long time to charge up but that could maybe have something to do with what type of head unit that you're plugging into the wall and the cord that you're using to try to charge it but it seems like it takes a very long time to charge up but that may just be because it holds so much, no clue. Actually if I had to guess I would bet my money that it has to do with it being like a micro USB rather than a USB-C, if you really look like that's what is making all of these new cell phones charge up so quickly and the older stuff like the micro USB seems to always take much longer for things but that's kind of a small gripe because of the sheer amount of time you can use it. I had another fan that was rechargeable and it didn't even come close to the 2200 or 2300 rounds per minute this fan has they make all these other camping fans that don't even come close to having the amount of storage that this thing has to where you can like charge up a cell phone or probably two or three if you really had to back to back, but it's pretty crazy how good it is the medium setting is even pretty decent. On that setting you could probably literally get like 16 hours of life or something crazy. I don't think anybody would really use it on the lowest setting I mean maybe like at night to sleep or something it's also even got a 2 hour or 4 hour auto off even though it seems like there should be like an 8 hour one or something since that's usually what people sleep but anyway, really really good product almost to the point of amazing with how powerful it can be at the top setting on a really hot day can truly make a difference if you had this with like a cold rag you literally could get through pretty much the hottest possible day and at least not be miserable like everyone else would be. And for the few pennies it would probably cost to charge it back up it's most definitely worth it. The only downside I can even remotely think of is that slow charge up time. But that could even be me using like an old cord or something. I even saw someone at one of these traveling Fair things where they were like selling lavender products and someone in one of the boots had the exact same fan where you could tell because the grip was like a different color sort of it can just sit there like on a desk or you can hold it and it is very surprisingly easy to hold up and it doesn't really make you feel as goofy as you think I had another fan that looks more kind of like a pinwheel and it's nowhere even close to as powerful as this it would literally be like this thing on the medium setting at best, and it was cheap it was only like 15 or 20 bucks but you never quite felt right, I mean for a girl and to me especially not to a guy, to sit there and hold up this fan that looks like a pinwheel like something a kid would hold up I mean obviously it's not quite that bad but it just doesn't quite seem right either. This thing is light years better than that because not only the speed is way better, literally probably like double, but it is nowhere even remotely close to as embarrassing to have to hold like in public--which really does make a huge difference more than you would think, it's actually surprising to me how far less embarrassing it just happens to be to hold this thing up in public versus the other fan that is rechargeable that I've got which doesn't even come close to this level of power. I really don't see how you could spend this kind of money especially if you get a coupon or discount getting it closer to like 30 bucks or 35 that's an absolute steal for what you're getting for this price I really don't think I could recommend it much more",

                "reviewText": "I endured a power outage in the height of summer last year. It was HORRIBLE! I was so hot and miserable and there was nothing I could do about it. So I went online to look up battery powered fans and was glad to find a rechargeable one that could also charge my devices! I wouldn't sell this fan for anything! It actually blows more air than you would expect from a fan of this size, and the battery lasts for a long time.I ended up buying this fan for my mom as well. You never know when and where a power outage will occur, and you'll hope you're prepared when one happens.",

                "reviewText": "If you need a portable fan to last an incredibly long time, this is just the product for you. I tried to measure how long it lasts on 1 charge, but after running for 24 hours, I lost track of how long it was going.I keep this under the seat in the back of my trunk, and forget about it. When an event is warmer than my girlfriend likes, we pull this out, turn the fan on high, and it runs for much longer than we want it to run. This thing moves a lot of air, and should last for years.Note - it is a rechargeable battery, so you want to DISCHARGE the battery completely, then charge it up again right away. That will give you a longer, fuller battery life. I have charged iPhones from the battery and USB-plug on this, and that works just fine. I can run the fan and also charge an iPhone at the same time.Variable speeds do what you expect them to do. Very quiet fan. Almost silent on low speed.",
