                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic Fan, If You Use It Correctly; The Multi-Function Switch Explained",
                "reviewText": "This little misting fan is a lifesaver when faced with blazing heat, whether in a delayed plane sitting the tarmac (when they refuse to turn on the AC), the doctor's office waiting room, when getting in a car waiting for the AC to cool down the interior, or to cool you down when you first enter your hot home, to name a few.Bottom Line First - This fan is excellent overall and performs its job perfectly. The only issue I see users having is (rightfully) getting confused on how to use the single multi-function switch to perform all functions.To those who are disappointed because this little mister fan isn't capable of cooling their entire room, house, or are unable to use this fan instead of getting your car's AC repaired . . . don't be silly. This is a small PERSONAL fan, meant to instantly cool you down when it's blazing hot, or perhaps when you need relief on a bike ride or run.HISTORYMisting fans in concept are nothing new. The idea is to somehow spray water in FRONT of the fan blades, which then shoots the mist on to your \"cooling zones\" (behind the ears, neck, mouth area, forehead). The first models (still sold on Amazon) were simply a Windex-style spray bottle with a fan attached in some manner behind the water spray nozzle. Way back 30 years ago I bought one at Disney World when it was blazing hot and humid in Orlando that time of year (big mistake on my part going there in August). It worked quite well to make the heat tolerable when I was walking around the park.Fast forward 30 years now we have mister fans that are compact, lightweight, run on internal lithium batteries, and the powered \"mister\" is a mini-humidifier that works on the same principle as your full-size humidifier. The motors are better made and faster than the clunky electric motors of old.OPERATIONOn this mister fan, a single switch/button operates the fan's various functions. The separate distinct functions are: 1) The fan; 2) the mister; and 3) the LED lights. EACH FUNCTION CAN OPERATE ON ITS OWN.The ONLY adjustable power or performance function is fan speed (speeds 1, 2, or 3). The mister or LED lights are either on or off. IOW the fan will run by itself, so too will the lights, so too will the mister. You can run any three functions in combination: fan/mister; fan; lights; mister; mister/lights; etc.Note: while the mini humidifier/mister will run by itself, the mist output is NOT sufficient for it to be used as a standalone humidifier. It will operate, but it won't cool down your computer keyboard and yourself. IOW, this if best used as a mister with the fan.Note: while the LED lights will function by themselves, IMO those are worthless; the lights contribute NOTHING to the operation of the fan and mister. In fact, run those lights around your friends, they are guaranteed to think you're LAME.BEST USEFor me, I get the best cooling effect by using the mister with the fan on power level 2. I hold the fan close to whatever \"zone\" I want to cool. For example, I will run it near my lips, ears, chin, upper lip, under the chin, on the neck, etc.What's super refreshing for me is to place it close to my skin (three inches) so the mist accumulates and drips down. I also do that on my chin. It feels like ice water and hitting my \"zones\" has a refreshing cooling effect. I move the fan in a small circular motion.Bonus Tip: You can try using the fan on #3 speed. If that works for you, great!Plain Speaking InstructionsFor those who don't read directions (I'm raising my hand here), pressing one button in various combinations to control all functions can be confusing. Don't get frustrated; here is how I remember which button presses do what.Again, remember that ALL functions are controlled by pressing the single multi-function button/switch.Side Note: Notice that on the handle front, at the top, there are two tiny indicator lights. The light on your right lights up if a fan feature is ON (mister, fan). The light on the left is the battery status indicator (red = charging; blue = fully charged).OK, here are the button presses. Note: You can press a function regardless of what you have on or off at the time. For example, you are running all 3 features (fan, mister, lights). You can at any time quickly double-click the switch to cycle the LED lights off and on.- FAN: Clicking the button/switch at normal speed (neither long nor quick press) cycles the fan's 3 speeds, or turns the fan off. (1, 2, 3, Off). Each successive press cycles an increase in speed. A fourth press turns the fan off.- LIGHTS: A fast double-click turns the LED light on or off. Again, the lights are added bling, and IMO totally lame.- MISTER: At any time LONG PRESSING the multi-function switch cycles the mister on and off.Note: TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE MISTER (E.G., IT RUNS OUT OF WATER WHILE STILL RUNNING), the mister has an auto-off timer. After about 10 minutes or less of operation, the mister automatically cycles to \"off.\"Bonus Tips:- To confirm if the mister is on or off I hold the fan sideways with a lighted area in the background so I can SEE the mist. If I don't see it, I either don't have it on, or God forbid, I am running it without water (which may damage the mister.- If your mister is NOT working confirm: Your battery is charged AND that water is visible in the clear tank that contours the top of the fan. Solution: Charge the battery, and/or fill the mister with water.- Noise: In an office, hospital waiting room, or other quiet zones, if all is quiet, people will HEAR this fan if it's on speed # 2 or #3. Quiet operation is NOT one of its attributes. For this reason, if in a quiet zone I recommend you keep the fan on speed 1, perhaps #2. The noise on speed 1 will not bother anyone. While speed 3 is a cooling demon (it really blows a LOT of air), I suspect people will be annoyed if you run it on the higher speeds. At level 3 it sounds like a mini vac. :-)Note: I have bought other fans on Amazon that blow a lot of air but because of intentional design (e.g., the blades are thin flexible plastic) those fans are whisper quiet on speeds two and three. This fan is NOT quiet like those.P.S. Don't leave it sitting anywhere. E.g., on a restaurant table while you are visiting the loo or whatever. Friends, parents, brothers, sisters, classmates, co-workers, police, FBI agents, or strangers will in a heartbeat will ride or drive off into the horizon with this fan. Adding insult to injury, family will act all innocent saying stuff like \"I dunno where your fan went. Did you have a fan? I didn't see no fan. How big was it? You should contact Lost n Found. Call the police, file a report. Call your insurance guy, file a claim.\"Super Bonus Tip: You can detect who stole your fan because after stashing it on their person, purse or backpack they say: \"Gotta go, I'm late, bye, so long, I'll call you, see you later, take care, text me, good luck, love you all . . . \" as they BOLT to the exit and burn rubber fleeing in their car.",

                "reviewText": "My brother brought 2 of these to Disneyland with us and I fell in love. We had 10 kids and 6 adults and there were days that were in the high 90's. We easily posted these 2 fans on two of the strollers and I had a different fan stroller set I bought at buy buy baby. My fans did not compare. The fan function is nice... but once you turn on the slight mist, it is a game changer! I have found that some misters make you only cool for a few seconds and you get hot as soon as you \"dry\" but these let off just enough cool to make it feel like a small portable air conditioner. We did not use the light feature much but the fans lasted 6-8 hours. So, SoCal heat vs NorCal heat is different. When we came back to Sacramento I decided to buy my own. I feared a little that I might get duds. But I sit outside in 100+ degree weather watching my kids football games with two toddlers so I was willing to try anything. These again, did not fail me! I bought two but am about to buy 2 more to replace my buy buy baby ones. They are small enough that the kids can carry them, or Mom and Dad can just hold them in the pointed direction of said toddler without arms hurting. We have allowed other parents who are sitting with us to use them and they all get such relief with these. No joke, I have probably sent 10+ people the link to these fans. The little clip is easy to attache to strollers... Can still be easily knocked off but it still works. So lightweight and the batteries last a while. Once i forgot to charge it and used my phone charger pack to re charge 1 while we watched the game and used the other. In my opinion, the water runs out quick, but if you need these, your most likely carrying around water anyway and it is easily re filled. I would for sure recommend these to people looking for a easy portable way to cool off.",

                "reviewText": "This handheld Misting Fan Portable Hand Fan was just what I was looking for and wanted. It\u2019s a handheld fan, a beauty humidifier, also a colorful nightlight all in one. I wanted this fan for when I was in the bath. It is super powerful for its size. It has a built in rechargeable battery that charges via a USB cord. The fine mist makes you feel like it's actually a small air conditioner. The mist is very fine and makes a huge difference in cooling but I wish it put out more of a mist. It still does the job well at cooling me. There are three speeds of low, medium and high and at high speed it really puts out a lot of air. I was surprised how much for the size of this handheld fan. This is a great fan, as pumps a good amount of air at all speeds. I am greatly impressed by the fans speed. The water container holds a fair amount of water and is easily refillable via the included mini squeeze bottle. Overall, this is a great Handheld Misting Portable Rechargeable Fan and I would highly recommend it. I love that it is rechargeable and easy to transport. It is compact and folds to half its size for probability. This misting fan was just what I wanted and it has all the bells and whistles including lights if you want them on. I give it 5-Stars.",

So much so I didn't really need to use it past the first few settings.",
