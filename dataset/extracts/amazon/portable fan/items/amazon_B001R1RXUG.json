                "reviewText": "My wife always gets too warm when putting makeup on in the bathroom, but we didn't want the expense and complexity of an overhead ceiling fan in there. Besides, that moves air around the whole room and she just wanted a little breeze in her face. Enter this fan - it's the perfect size for the countertop, looks nice, and the long electrical plug can reach a surprisingly long distance to an outlet. Clicking it on, there wasn't a lot of noise, but it put out a lot of wind! Excellent. And then we discovered that was the LOW setting! Medium and high weren't noisy either, but generated considerably more air movement. This was exactly what we were looking for! Money well spent if you ask me. Hopefully it lasts a long time, but if it's made by Honeywell, I'm sure it will be fine for years to come.",

                "reviewText": "We use this fan in our travel trailer. It\u2019s light weight and can be wall mounted. The noise level is low and it moves plenty of air. The speed settings are helpful for setting the amount of air we need for cooling or just circulating the room air. Good price, simple design, and very functional. Perfect for a smaller room, travel trailer, or office space. Would purchase again.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very compact, sturdy fan and great for small areas or apartments. There are 3 speed settings and they all work well. I usually keep mine on the lowest setting as I find the other ones a bit too powerful for my usage. The pivot up and down works well; I find it stiff enough to stay where I point it. So far it has not fallen when pointed in either direction. The bottom is flat and wide enough that it makes it sturdy. It is still very lightweight though and very easy to move around and pick up.I do find this quite loud, especially on the higher settings, but it's not intolerable. I personally use this in my living room so I haven't tried to sleep with it, but I imagine it might keep some people awake.Overall, really great compact fan and does the job. Despite being made of plastic, it's sturdy and well made. Great purchase!",
