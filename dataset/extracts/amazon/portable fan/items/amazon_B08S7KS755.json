The flow of air is strong and easily adjustable. Its quiet. Three strong speeds at the click of a button on the back. I havent had it long enough to comment on battery life, but with a 5000mah I expect long operation on a single charge.I bought this as a gift for my friend's vintage car which lacks a climate control system. It clips strongly to the dash and provides great airflow. The noise is very much like a normal car system, so no distraction from noise. LED lights indicate speed and charge status. It is better and quieter than a plug-in fan of similar size. I can imagine dozens of applications for this little gem; Travel, camping, office, gym, car, yoga class, school, just to name a few. It does stand and operate on its own base, so you dont have to clip it to a flat surface. It is highly adjustable and works well at every angle. It is attractive and easy to use. I bought navy blue and its nice. Recommended.",

I wanted to buy him a fan that would give a subtle breeze because too much air tends to gets his allergies going. I charge it for several hours during the day and even use it for myself while it's charging. This fan works very well and I love it! My sin is also happy with it too. I try to keep it in medium speed so he was feel it and would last most of the night. I don't know how long it last because by the the time he wakes up the battery has already died. I know it does last most of the night because I go to bed very late and it's still running when I check on him. Overall I am very happy with the fan and I think I will purchase another one for my other child. However, I think I will get a corded one so I will know for sure they are being cooled the whole night. Removed a star because the clip is not very secure on the pole of his bed and therefore I have to clip it to the ladder to ensure it won't slide down.",

                "reviewText": "Wow, I am literally blown away by this fan! I needed it for a blazing hot outdoor July 4th Concert I was performing in. Amazon got it to me in time and it way exceeded my expectations. I have used clip on electric fans before (that have worked great!), but there was no way to hook up to electricity at this concert\u2026 and I had low expectations for a battery powered fan. Amazingly, it easily clipped to any part of my music stand, or anywhere else I would want to put it. The adjustability was mind-blowing\u2026. it easily could be aimed in any direction, at any angle\u2026 and it had all the nonstop power I needed. Super lightweight and quiet. It never slowed and easily made it through both the sound check and the performance. By the end of the concert, my colleagues were coming up to me\u2026 so impressed never having seen a fan like this! So I ended up sharing the Amazon link, and people were buying it on the spot, right there onstage. If you even think you would like a fan like this, I promise you, this one is Fantastic, and so reasonably priced\u2026 get it, you will be so glad you did!",

The only con is, the USB cable is only 16ins. I have a desktop, & I can't charge while it's on my monitor. Like I said it's a good little fan. Powerful & Quiet",
