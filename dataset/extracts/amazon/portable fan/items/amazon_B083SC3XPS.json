I use it in the car to keep my dog cool when traveling, since the air conditioner doesn't do so well in the back seat. I adjust it where he can either let it blow on him, or not, as he chooses. It has different speeds which is perfect, depending on how much cooling is needed.",

So they warned us we would be without electricity for at least three days.I jumped on Amazon and ordered this battery operated fan because it is HOT and I can't sleep without a fan. Who else needs a fan to sleep? I do!The first night without a fan was miserable. Luckily this arrived the next day and was amazing from the start! It does have great air flow, I used the lowest setting all night and what a relief! Used it for three nights and still going strong!This is now in my emergency kit for power outages.And like someone else pointed out...order the batteries at the same time! LOL! Thanks for that tip whoever you are!This fan is easy to carry and doesn't take up much space.Quiet for a battery operated fan!Pushes out lots of air!This will also be my new traveling fan for hotel stays. I love that you can use batteries or usb. I have several usb power banks and you should too!Get it! You won't regret it!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. So i have to say that I wasn't expecting much from this fan. The price was fair and i had seen mixed reviews. Figured I would give it a shot since Amazon has a good return policy.Pros:It has a convenient handle to carry fan.The fan pivots up and down far. Giving you lots of options to set it up for optimal air flow.Has 3 adjustable fan speed settings.Has 3 shut-off timer settings if you need.The max fan speed puts out a great deal of air considering the size of the unit itself.Included is a usb plug to run it off of power sources. Also as D battery size compartment to make it portable.Cons: the battery life is fair but could be better. We had it runing on hi for 7hours until it shut off by itself. I'm assuming it may have gotten hot.No hanging hook to use in tent. But you can always use string or something.The model i got was yellow, and i hate yellow.No light other than the buttons that could be used while camping or reading a book.Overall I'm very satisfied with the fan. Small fan with big air. Definitely going to buy more.",

I felted kind of ripped off that I had to purchase more expensive fans but they were worth the price. My children, 16 and 11 both took one to scout camp during a very humid and hot week last week. They both loved the low white noise from the fan and appreciated its cooling power at night. One of my sons had it on full blast most of the time and didn't need replacement batteries until night 5 of the camping trip and the other kept his on medium and used a timer most of the time just to get through until he was in his REM sleep and his batteries lasted the entire 7 nights and still has power remaining. These are not cheaply made fans and I am expecting a decent life out of them.",
