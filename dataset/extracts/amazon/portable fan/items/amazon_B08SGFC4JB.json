                "reviewText": "I actually have mine on the floor in a corner set on speed two. There are only two speeds, a third would be better. Although it isn\u2019t hot here now - I live in North-Central Florida, a third higher speed would be fantastic in warmer months.Fan is actually smaller than I thought but it does a decent job of circulating ac cooled air in my living room. I suspect it\u2019ll also will help circulate central heat soon.Quality is fine. I think it\u2019s somewhat overpriced. An oscillating option is something that would make this fan a great deal.As stated flow is pretty good. This is mid-November so time will tell if only 2 speeds can do the job inFL heat.Fan is very quiet.",

                "reviewText": "I had two small Duracraf fans, but one burned out in Ireland (I had a converter that apparently didn\u2019t work) so I needed a new fan. I looked high and low for a replacement Duracraft and couldn\u2019t find one. I settle on this fan. It works fantastic as a personal fan. I also use it for white noise when I travel and it has what I consider the perfect noise level. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s noisy, it\u2019s not, it\u2019s a fan. It actually seems to move more air than the Duracraft. One improvement is they put rubber pads on the stand that help keep it in place when changing the setting. Overall a great little fan and well worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "The fan itself is great. Good airflow, good sound (not too quiet, not too loud, just enough white noise to be soothing), but I did not realize that it does not have a tilt feature. Once it sits on the counter, you can turn it left or right (obviously), but the fan does not tilt up or down to direct airflow in a specific direction. It is one static piece, so you have to be sure the fan is placed at a certain height to get the airflow directed where you want it to go. I wanted to place it on a high shelf and tilt the blades to direct the airflow down, but with no tilt feature, the airflow is blowing over my head and not down to where the airflow is needed. Propping something under the legs to the whole fan is tilted in the direction the airflow is needed will make the fan unstable. Be sure to know where you will want to place the fan to ensure the airflow will be where you want it to be.",
