The different lighting options are great, very bright and work well. 4 fan speeds, highest being impressive, but not overbearing. Hook on the bottom to hang the fan if needed. Large battery capacity that supposedly will keep the fan going on the lowest setting for up for 40 some hours. There are charging ports on the side, USB, and usb-c. Although when I tried to use my own Anker 100W charger to charge my phone thru the fan, my phone received a warning to \"make sure the cable is plugged in correctly\" thought that was odd, but I'm sure regular charging cables work fine. Just don't expect to fast charge anything on this. But what else is there to say. Portable, rechargeable, lightweight, durable, multiple functions. Bright LED light installed, with several Brightness levels. 4 different fan speeds. Large battery for fan life, and to charge electronics. Hanging hook on the bottom. Once the battery dies, it takes a long time to recharge the fan, around 8 to 12 hours, but it stays alive for a long long time. I definitely recommend. Will come in handy when camping, and I'm sure even around the house.",

GREAT battery life, good power to the breeze for the size, the light is bright, and the usb feature works great. I\u2019ve used this for camping, outdoor music festivals, and cruises. Definitely a great purchase for yourself and as a gift!",

                "reviewText": "Great features that makes this a step above the rest. The dual fan gives you a powerful stream of air. You can set the fan far away and still feel a steady air flow, even on lower settings. Battery life is excellent, at least three full nights at full blast. More if you keep it at half which is still a very decent flow of air. The hanging clip is genius, it turns so when you hang it from the top of your tent you can actually adjust it to point where you want the air flow to go. Light is nice and bright and the addition of night mode to turn off the indicator lights is pretty cool as well. Bonus as a portable battery charger as well! Very well made and will be an addition to our camping setup from now on. It\u2019s very much worth the money!!",

Well, this makes a mosquito defeating breeze, lights up the space, and even charges your phone. We used this to shine light on the stove while blowing mosquitos away while we cooked. We hung it from the roof of our tent and it provided air circulation through a balmy night. And the battery lasts and lasts.",

Plus the actual fan pivots 180\u00b0 and can hang upside down. Thing is awesome!",

I was past the return window provided by Amazon, so I contacted the Seller about the problem. They responded immediately and indicated they would replace the fan. Within a brief number of days, I have received a new fan which is working perfectly! It is such a pleasure to discover a Seller who stands behind their products. Given how well they have responded to me, I can unhesitatingly recommend them. And, I really like this fan. It is light weight but I cannot report yet on battery life or longevity. All my friends who have seen it agree it is a great fan. It has rechargeable batteries and lights and speed that can be lowered or increased. It has a hook that allows a way to hang it up. It has a sleep function also, allowing you to set the fan to go off after a period of time. My one suggestion for improvement is that the recharging cord needs to be a bit longer.",

                "reviewText": "Just to begin, I've already ordered a second because this thing is soooo good.It arrived 3/4 charged and the light has 3 very useful settings, the fan has 4 speeds, it has a \"dark mode\" if you're light sensitive when sleeping and a 360 degree rotating hook for your tent top.It's bright and lights up a good area. The fan is very awesome. I've always dreamed of having a fan when camping in 30+ degree weather, but this isn't a toy...this is the real deal.On the first night, I fell asleep with the fan on the lowest setting. I woke up midway through the night and shut it off. In the morning, the power was still at the 100% mark. I decided to be more liberal with it's use since a thunderstorm was rolling in and it was HOT and humid. This thing was so refreshing. At night when I had difficulty getting my fire started I suddenly realized there was no need to get dizzy blowing on the fire...boom...this bad-boy turned a few little sparks into the best fire on the lake with some not-so-great wood. I just put it near the parts that I was able to make glow and blasted it on high. Soon enough, there was a beautiful fire. I'd never imagined using it for this, but there it was, saving my fire and giving me my entertainment for the evening.After two days of regular use, it has 75% left in the battery. Like...c'mon. We're living in the future. :)",
