                "reviewText": "fan: 10/10 cooling capabilities. i got this fan to use when i'm chillin on my loft bed because it gets HOT in my room when the heat's on. there are times when i'm a little too chilly with this on, so i have to turn it down to the first speed. it's a more powerful fan than expected, which i love. it may be loud for some but i feel like it easily turns into background noise and isn't any louder than a regular fan with the same power.charge: i charged the fan for about an hour with my fast charging usb-c extension cable. it stayed on for just under 11 hours on speed 2. this is pretty good because a full charge is listed as taking 2-3 hours, which would give you 14 hours of speed 2 usage. i've fallen asleep for 8+ hours on speeds 1 and 2 just to wake up to the fan still being on, and it stays on for hours after that. on speed 1, it's on basically all day, though i only timed the 11 hour use (i remembered to test it then). note: i have only charged this with a usb-c cable + a block, not in a car or via laptop.flashlight: brighter than expected, works well. my only qualm is that i can't use the flashlight at the same time as the fan, but i don't mind. i mostly got this for the fan feature anyway, and the good reviews. i can't imagine really needing the fan and flashlight on at the same time.power bank: i don't really plan on using this for the power bank feature much, but it works!design: compact, cute, sturdy, and adjustable.other: i really like that this charges with usb-c because i have so many usb-c cables. that personally makes this product even better for me, because if something happens to the provided cable, i'll still have more!",

Secondly, this cute little device is a triple threat!! Works as a phone battery charger, a fan and a flashlight\u2026.I absolutely love it! Don\u2019t let the looks fool you, the fan on this baby is powerful and so is the flashing. It comes with a charging cable which is great to have. The device itself is compact and has a little weight to it. The quality of the product is good as well. I\u2019m currently charging the battery so I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how long it will last. Overall, I am so glad I got this product! Also, the packing and shipping was fast and efficient!",

                "reviewText": "I am a student athlete so I was looking for a way to cool down quick. I run hot anyways so I always felt miserable because I sweat pretty easily. I was SO excited when I purchased this. My mom has a similar one that she uses at work and she never leaves without it so I was happy to try it.PROS:The fan is very effective. There are two speeds but speed 1 alone was enough to generate enough of a breeze to cool me down. I used it while drinking a glass of ice water and the cool waft of air over the ice was MAGICAL. Speed number 2 was great when I needed to cool quick such as around my neck and down my shirt.I also think it is extremely safe especially since I am always around other students. The blades are made of blunt plastic and the fan stops when it comes in contact with , say, your fingers.I know some people were ambivalent about the sound. Personally, I do not mind it. The hum was very calming for me, especially when I have some downtime and I am trying to wind down from the chaos. The combination of the breeze and the hum was enough to lull me into a power nap.The charge lasts a LOOONG time. I charged it to full for about 2.5 hours. I use it between 1 and 2 speeds between 3-8 hours and it doesn't lose strength at all. It's been almost 3 weeks and I have yet to charge it.The flashlight is strong and bright. I do not have much use for it but I guess it is a nice feature for emergency.CONS:I wish it was smaller. I saw my mom's and hoped it would be smaller. Don't get me wrong...it is still pretty compact but it takes a little dexterity to manage. They described it as palm-sized. It is not so keep that in mind.Speaking of dexterity, it is sort of difficult to open it. If you do not fingernails or something sharp to \"scratch\" it out of its nook, you may have a hard time for a bit before you can get the fan out. It may be because it is still new and may loosen up but it is unlikely. I will post again if it changes.It comes with a small lanyard but it was hard to fit it into the little holes provided. I still have not been able to fit it in but will keep trying.The charging light was a little confusing, especially if you are used to the \"red light, green light\" (see what I did there? Those who know, know). It is a red light that blinks continuously until it it is fully charged. Then it becomes a solid red light when full.OVERALL:it is a good buy! Get it if you tend to overheat.",

                "reviewText": "Wanted to buy a handheld fan for a convention I went to this summer. Bought this one because it was cute and cheap. But boy was it a lifesaver! Cosplaying in the middle of August and walking around a room with like a thousand people\u2026 yeah I didn\u2019t really sweat at all because I had this thing. And I got compliments on it to. Now I use it a lot at work for my desk (pictured), or I\u2019ll even have it in hand while I\u2019m presenting something at work (because I get nervous and sweaty, what can I say). The only thing I probably dislike about it is the fact that the blades are exposed. But that\u2019s part of the design and I knew that before buying it, so I\u2019m not gonna ding my review over that. It\u2019s just sometimes if I\u2019m not paying attention, I\u2019ll talk with my hands and end up hitting my cheek with the spinning blades. Which doesn\u2019t cause any serious injury because the blades aren\u2019t sharp and they auto turn off if touched. But it\u2019s just like a quick \u201couch wtf!\u201d when I\u2019m not expecting it lol. Again, that\u2019s my own fault and not a negative of the product. Just something you may wanna keep in mind if you\u2019re like me and talk with your hands. Also this thing charges pretty quickly and lasts forever. Haven\u2019t had a need to really use the flashlight feature, but it does work and it\u2019s nice to know I have it if needed.",
