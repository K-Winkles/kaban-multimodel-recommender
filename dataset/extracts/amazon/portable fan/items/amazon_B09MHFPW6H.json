You could use it in a restaurant or church/temple/mosque and hold it in your lap, pointing it up to your face, and it would be very subtle, and you would get relief instantly! Much less obvious than a big hand fan. I love it so much I bought two more. I have one in my house, in my purse, and in a travel bag.",

It is light and compact. The performance is ok. Batteries last a long time The fan fits easily in a compact purse or small bag. If it is not too hot, it is durable. Don't expect cold cold air. However, if it's 100 degrees outside, stuffy, and no air circulating, this is like taking a newspaper and fanning yourself. The bottom line all depends on the variables when you are using this, temperature outside, and your body's ability to withstand heat. I love air conditioners.",
