                "reviewText": "First and foremost, I do love this little fan. I bought it because the hot flashes and night sweats were getting the best of me. I keep it under a pillow on my bed at night so its right there when I need it. One night I put it back under the pillow and bumped the power button accidentally and turned it back on. The next morning I was looking for it thinking it had fallen off the bed but it was still under the pillow and it was *still* going!I carry this fan wherever I go and its really been a game changer for me. It is small and light, fits into my purse. It has a great battery life and it is quiet, rechargeable and has 4 speeds, wonderful strength of air flow. Comes with a stand so you can also use it hands free. I also use it to dry facial serums and masks.I like it better than the ones that hang around the neck. They may be completely hands free but when I'm having a hot flash I can direct a pretty strong breeze exactly where I need it. (Those who have experienced it will KNOW what I mean) Several reviewers have mentioned that it is weak but that has not been my personal experience.Which brings us to the one flaw that drives me absolutely nuts. That power/speed button. Ugh. If it had a dedicated power switch it would be perfect. It is just way too easy to turn it on by accident. I have to be really careful how I put it in my purse and make sure the button is against something flat or it will get bumped and turn on. Its quiet so I never notice til I look in my purse. I don't mind that sort of button for the speed. No issues there but maybe a little switch somewhere to turn it off and on and can't be turned on by accident. I'm taking off one star for that aggravation but other than that I absolutely love it.",

I use one in my bathroom, in the kitchen, and take one with me in the car in case I need to take it somewhere.My only issue is the base stands. They are great at keeping the fans upright, however I ended up losing all 3 of these bases.I reached out to customer service. They are amazing! They responded to my message on Amazon within 24 hours. Not only did they send replacements for all 3 bases, but they sent me 3 new fans altogether- which I did not ask for. I would\u2019ve been happy with just purchasing replacement bases, however this company went above and beyond. 100% customer satisfaction!!As for the fans themselves, perfect size, portable, pretty colors, charges in very little time with a C type cord, and has 3 speeds, all which are more than sufficient at doing it\u2019s job for such a small fan. I live in Las Vegas, so any extra \u201cair conditioning\u201d is always helpful!",

So far (it\u2019s been a few weeks) this fan has been amazing! It holds battery life well, and didn\u2019t take too long to charge. I use this fan on a daily basis and I\u2019ve only charged it once. The product is the exact same as shown in the photos. I have tested a few different fans and this is by far my favourite. Doesn\u2019t feel like cheap quality either. I will update this review if the fan stops working :)",
