                "reviewText": "I purchased a similar type fan a couple years ago to use at DJ events that I worked. It had the same flexible legs and could attach to various surfaces but it was not very powerful and the battery life seemed inconsistent. I'm happy to say that this one does not have any of those drawbacks. The flexible legs are quite convenient for attaching to tables, chairs, etc., or just for shaping into a stand that can sit on a tabletop. The small profile of the fan head initially concerned me that it would provide very much coverage, but it actually works really well, oscillating or not. The speed settings are nice, and the battery life has been great. It also works plugged in for really long periods of use, though I haven't needed to run it like that yet. It's been solid for the multiple hour periods I've needed it thus far. Nice product for a nice price!",

The base is adjustable and I can either hold it or bend it so that it sits on my end table blowing on me. No idea why I waited so long to make this purchase! If you carry a big enough purse, it will fit. And the battery uses very little juice so it would go for hours without needing a charge. Such a small investment for a big return in my opinion. TOTALLY WORTH IT!! My husband even uses it to cool off after working outside in this heat.",

This product may be better suited for the younger babies, but I\u2019m still happy with it because it does provide some relief for him.

                "reviewText": "This little fan has some power behind it. Three different fan speeds which was surprising for this little thing. We recently changed our daughters bed to a loft bed and realized too late that her ceiling fan was way too close when she was climbing off her ladder. We got this for bedtime and it\u2019s totally worth it. The first night we got it I thought it died, but it actually just shuts off after a while which was a plus.",
