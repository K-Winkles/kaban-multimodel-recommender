Hopefully the recharge batteries will last. Even if it breaks down after 6 months it\u2019s still worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using my fan for a few months and just bought a second one for Christmas gift exchanges while it was on sale.Overall I'm happy with this. It is not perfect, but it is convenient and solved some problems a slightly bulkier fan was giving me.I have a Honeywell mini fan that I like quite a bit, but it it bulkier and was not convenient to carry in my small messenger bag. It also didn't have an internal battery, though you could run it off of AA batteries, which had positives and negatives.I wanted a slimmer fan that was flatter and fit in my compact bag and this one fits the bill. It slips into my snug, small bag pretty well. There is a bit of a bulge on the back, but it is much slimmer than the honeywell.The internal battery is convenient; I don't have to carry batteries with me. And it has a USB-C port, so I can use the cables I already carry with me instead of a proprietary charge cable.It has 3 speed settings where the Honeywell only has one, but the top-setting is about the same as the Honeywell. The 1st setting is pretty worthless, though now that the weather is cooler the 2nd setting is useful sometimes.Some other reviewers have noted that the button that is flat on the front poses a danger of turning the fan on if it's bumped in your bad. This has happened to me maybe twice in the past few months. It's certainly possible, but I have not found it to not happen very often. And I have been carrying it in a pretty tightly packed, slim bag.The noise level. I think when I first got it I noticed the sound was maybe ever-so-slightly higher-pitch. Not loud, but if you have it on silently you can notice it. If you're using it where there's some ambient noise around you it won't be noticeable and at this point I don't notice it. I can be sensitive to obnoxious sounds and this doesn't bother me at all.The built-in stand it pretty good. It cleanly folds up to help the fan stay flat and low-profile. However, it gets in the way of the charge port. It will certainly still let you stand it up while charging, but it will limit the angle a little and the base of your cable will have to bend around it. I can work around it okay, but it does put it as a slightly less ideal angle sometimes.The internal battery is nice. You can charge it up with your same USB chargers and cables. It runs off a USB power pack fine. The life isn't crazy; I can get maybe 3-4 hours on high-power (i feel like closer to 4, though I haven't timed it scientifically). In comparison, I could get almost 8 hours off 4 AA-batteries on my Honeywell, though the last hour or so the power weakens until it peters out. This one goes strong until right before it peters out, but that said it does not last as long on a charge. But I find it quite adequate and the ease of charging/plugging in makes it easy to deal with. I always wish batteries lasted longer; a full \"workday\" is ideal. This doesn't make it, but I don't feel disappointed using it.The build quality...I mean, it's not a high-dollar item. It feels solid and it's getting the job done; it doesn't feel flimsy. But I'm not expecting it to last forever. That said, it is priced well and is well worth the price.So to try to sum things up:- Good compact size that folds relatively flat- 3 power settings, 2 of which are very useful to me.- Sound i maybe a little higher pitch but is not at all obnoxious or \"loud\".- Adequate battery life, ~4 hours on high-speed setting.- Easy to charge with USB-C port; no proprietary charge cable. But the placement of the port can slightly impact stand angles if you're charging/powering the fan with a cable plugged inOverall I am very happy with this. Even when I went back to carrying a bigger bag that can accommodate my bulkier Honeywell fan, I've kept using this because it's just more convenient to fit in my bag and to charge without a special cable. So if you get hot when you eat at a restaurant or work at a coffee shop/library, I'd definitely recommend you carry one of these in your bag. It's easy to carry around, to setup and put away, and to charge internally or with an external power source. It makes my life a lot easier when I'm setting up at tables/desks when I'm away from home.",

                "reviewText": "As far as I am concerned, there is nothing to dislike about this small, neat, desk top/bedside table fan. For its size, the fan is very efficient, even on the lowest setting. There are three settings, but I keep mine on the lowest one and it is enough. Charging is simple with the supplied cable, and the red charging light turns to blue when the fan is fully charged. Depending on how long the fan is in use, depends on how often and for how it needs charging. Mine has not run out of charge yet,, but I keep the batteries topped up either on a daily basis or on alternate days - I like to know it is ready for use when I need it, mostly at bedtime at present. The fan is quiet on the low setting, louder on the other two, but not excessively so and the movement of cool air it creates, is just right for me. How long a fan of such a small size will last, I cannot say, but having acquired it, I would not like to be without it, so, I am going to order another one as soon as I can. The fan comes in a range of colours to suit taste/decor, I chose cream and the only adverse thing about it is, it states on Amazon that the base will turn so the fan can be at an angle. My fan doesn't do this, but I maybe 'missing a trick'. It isn't a problem, however, as the compact nature of the fan, and it isn't heavy, allows for easy movement and positioning as required. Altogether, a worthwhile purchase and fully deserving of five stars. It was delivered promptly and securely packed for transit.",
