                "reviewText": "Best travel-personal fan I've come across. The fan is inside, so it won't break or hit you. You can hang it from your neck, so it's RIGHT where you need it and you can move and keep your hands free. It's not too heavy. It shoots the air right towards your face. I knotted the strap a little to make it shorter so it was closer to my face/neck, and that worked better for me.I've had tons of other travel fans that broke after one use, or didn't move enough air. This actually makes a decent breeze and has lasted through several trips.Takes 2 AA batteries. Lasts for hours (I haven't changed batteries in a while). It looks more subtle than you'd think it would--it's a little bigger than the palm (not fingers) of a m/l woman's hand.You can hear it--but it's not obnoxious. I really do recommend this if you think you'll ever need a personal fan!",

My daughters to bring to Orlando this summer and they\u2019ll be camping in that crazy heat so I thought this might help them survive a bit! Mine has held up great! I cannot recommend this cheap little fan enough. I need to start giving it out as gifts to everyone! Do yourself a favor and buy it. It\u2019s not heavy and it does the job. I sometimes wear it while vacuuming or other things like this. When my girls get back from Orlando, I might take their fans back and leave them all over the house like some people leave extra reading glasses. I love this little guy.",

                "reviewText": "This item has been wonderful for me since I need air moving due to asthma and allergies. I have used this multiple times since I received it and it has been working well on the original Duracell batteries that I read worked the best for this. The only think that I think that could be better is a way to lock the on and off button. I keep this in my purse so that I have it at any time I may need it. I have put it into my purse carefully, but with being in and out of a purse for one reason or another, this cooking fan has gotten the button pushed and turning it on IN MY PURSE and since it is quiet, I didn't even realized it was running. You are not supposed to brock the air intake and since it was in my purse, that could have happened. Luckily it didn't harm the fan. So, to me, it would be a very good feature to have the slide off and on button either be a bit harder to turn on making it less sensitive or have a way to secure the on and off button so that just slight pressure on it, like slipping it into a purse, will not activate it. Other than that, I am very happy with the amount of air that I get from this little device and how quiet it is. .",

The fan worked surprisingly well for its size. It didn't blast ice cold air at me like it was a jet engine, but it was comfortable. It has an adjustable strap which came in handy if I wanted the cool air closer to my face or needed it out of the way. This fan was light enough to wear for hours at a time and survived several hard knocks. The battery life was pretty good too. I usually got 25-40 hours out of them (turning it off at lunch helped).",
