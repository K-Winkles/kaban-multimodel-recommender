                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A real fan that can go anywhere. Almost perfect.",
                "reviewText": "Quick summary: this fan provides sufficient airflow for personal cooling (much more than most small USB or battery powered fans provide), in a compact package with good battery life and multiple charging options. The only flaw so far is that it is too easy to activate it accidentally.Full review:To set the context, heat is my enemy. I hate warm weather. I keep my house at 68F and I always have a fan running at my desk or beside my bed. So when planning a two week trip to Italy in the summertime I knew I would want to bring a fan with me.In the past I have used the small 4\u201d diameter USB powered fans that are commonly sold on Amazon but the airflow is weak and they wear out and begin to rattle quickly. They also require a USB power source at all times. I also use a Ryobi portable jobsite site fan sometimes but it is too large and heavy to pack.The ideal portable fan should produce ample airflow, pack relatively flat, store enough power for a decent runtime, and be easy to charge. Durability and quiet operation are important factors as well.This fan (The oddly named Koonie) delivers on all counts. Airflow is excellent. Most of the time I have it on the medium setting. It is quiet, and more compact than I expected. The clip folds sideways making the whole fan about 3-4\u201d thick when packed flat. It\u2019s not exactly small but I had no trouble fitting it in a day pack when traveling. I haven\u2019t tested the total battery life yet but after a couple of hours on a train it was still showing full charge (more on that later). It charges with both micro USB and USC-c, which is great. More importantly it will run while charging, so you can power it with a USB-c charger all night and then take it with you on a day trip first thing in the morning. The clip is quite effective and I\u2019ve had no trouble attaching it to a variety of mounting points. I\u2019ve included a photo of the fan clipped to the overhead luggage rack in an Italian train. Overall, this fan has checked all my requirements, and I sincerely wish I\u2019d had this years ago.Nit Picking:- The button that activates the fan is flush with the back surface, and while it\u2019s a perfectly nice, clicky button, it is easy to activate the fan when it\u2019s packed in luggage or a backpack. I found it running on more than one occasion. I plan to put a layer of packing tape over the button to reduce accidental activations.- The battery life indicator is nice to have, but could stand to be more granular. It has four levels: 100%, 60%, 30% and nothing (all lights dead). Many fans have no charge indicator at all, so this is hardly a complaint worth mentioning.Other than that I can\u2019t find anything to complain about. The build quality is higher than I expected and I don\u2019t think it will break unless abused. I should note that I don\u2019t know what sort of bearings it has, so longevity is uncertain. I also haven\u2019t fully tested the max runtime. Other than that I can confidently recommend this to anyone who needs a portable, compact, battery powered fan.",

                "reviewText": "We have several battery powered fans and this is one of my favorites. The amount of wind it moves with minimal noise is impressive, and though we normally keep it plugged in, we've been able to use it on medium for 5-6 hours during power outages. The base is a clip mechanism but it's pretty stable on a tabletop. It can charge off of micro-USB or USB-C. It has separate LED indicators for fan speed and charge level, and the lights (which are tiny) are amber so if you are like me and dislike blue light in the room when you're trying to sleep, it might be less annoying. We haven't had occasion to use the clamp mount but it's a nice option to have. This fan is light and easy to move, and the grill comes off for easier cleaning.I liked this fan so much I bought one to give as a housewarming gift, and the recipient liked it so much she bought a second one to keep around the house. I have come to love cordless fans even more than I love cordless vacuum cleaners! Immensely useful for more than just power outages. And this Koonie 8-inch fan is a great choice.",

I\u2019ve had mine for over a year now and they work great. I have one in my main seating area and one in my bedroom. The motor noise is still consistent with out if the box quality, nice a quiet humm. We live in the desert where it is very dusty and I love that I can remove the face for easy cleaning (simply twist to the left and pull face off). Mine stay plugged in, but will hold a charge all night, if needed. Airflow is amazing; I never have a need to have it above medium speed. My husband even tries to steal the direction of our bedroom fan and he enjoys it from his side of the end, as well. I offered to buy him one for his side, but we both agreed the price is a bit steep. However, price aside, We are happy with our fans.",

I used to carry a plug in fan for our outdoor concerts, but that was cumbersome, and it would be problematic for the venues where there were no plugs. This is perfect because it clips tightly onto the music stand (the hefty ones, not wire stands), isn't too loud to affect the mikes and is much easier/smaller to carry but big enough to get plenty of circulation. I love that it's rechargeable and I don't have to worry about batteries, which would make it heavy.",

                "reviewText": "Summary: Not only does it save space, but it is conveniently wireless when needed, and is powerful enough to stand up against full-sized fans....I love this little fan. I took it on a trip recently, because I need white noise to fall asleep, and I am always hot LOLThe price is worth the quality, and special features, in my opinion.I was honestly just looking for a wired fan, but the fact that it is wireless is really cool. You charge it using a charging cable, and the battery life is actually quite good (on the highest setting, I could get away with 7-hours unplugged, almost a full night's sleep). This means less cables cluttering your space, and you can take it somewhere where there may not be any power outlets.The strength of the fan is what really surprised me. For it's size, I wasn't expecting much. But it's actually more powerful than some older, full-size fans I own. It reaches across a normal sized room on full-power.The clip is incredibly strong. I don't worry about hitting it in the night and having it fall on the floor. The clip also doubles as a regular stand. You can put it on your desk, side-table, or even a ledge if you don't have the space!It is also very compact. It turns completely around on the base so it can lay it flat if you need to carry it in a bag, and can be moved around when in use so you always get the best angle.Very happy with this purchase, I would advise others to buy one :)",

                "reviewText": "Lo primero que me gustar\u00eda mencionar es su construcci\u00f3n, es resistente y se mueve perfectamente en todas direcciones sin que se dificulte el dejarlo fijo en la posici\u00f3n deseada. El clip de sujeci\u00f3n es incre\u00edblemente resistente, necesitas de las 2 manos para abrirlo y se fija muy bien a diferentes superficies y formas, tiene una protecci\u00f3n pl\u00e1stica tipo espuma para no da\u00f1ar la superficie del lugar al que lo sujetas. Su peso no es demasiado, y es relativamente compacto. Su bater\u00eda es muy duradera, es dif\u00edcil precisar la duraci\u00f3n m\u00e1xima porqu\u00e9 lo he usado por horas y no he podido terminar la carga. El flujo de aire es muy bueno, incluso en la velocidad m\u00e1s baja y el ruido en la m\u00e1s alta es bastante tolerable. Considero que su desempe\u00f1o es bastante bueno y su precio no es tan alto.",

                "reviewText": "I reviewed this Koonie product online before my purchase and was impressed with good reports. I use mine on low (audible but not noisy), this speed is adequate to cool me off and has a calming effect, I use it on battery most of the time (which seems to last many hours) but cannot say exactly how long before a recharge is needed, when using my computer I connect it via usb to top up the battery while in use. The two charging ports is a good idea. I have accidently knocked it off a height of 1m on three occasions (fortunately remains undamaged).",
