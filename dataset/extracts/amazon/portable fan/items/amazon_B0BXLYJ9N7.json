                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Got this to use while we travel outside. Didn't have much expectation but was impressed with the build quality and the functionality. Works great and the fan wind is above par as per my expectations. The inbuilt rechargeable battery is good to have to save expenses on AA/AA batteries in the long run. Highly recommended product.My 2 cents below:Pros:- Looks great. Not at all a cheap feeling- Light in weight and hence good for being portable- Fans have a 4-speed level & wind capacity is great- Fan can move 270\u00b0 rotation b& can swivel 45 or 90 degrees - Inbuilt LED lights can be useful for dark situations - Considerably very silent operation even at max level- Very handy and hence easy to use. It is appropriate for adult hands- Inbuilt hook can be used to hang these anywhere - Inbuilt 10000 mAh rechargeable battery is a great feature to save on batteries in the long run- It is a portable fan & great during travel- Has remote control with all functionality in it - Very reasonably pricedCons:- None that I see for this price and quality",

Every aspect of this fan has been meticulously designed for outdoor enthusiasts.The size is absolutely perfect for camping - it's compact enough to be easily packed in my camping gear, yet the fan power doesn't fall short of impressive. With four adjustable speed settings, I could customize the airflow based on my need, keeping me comfortable through both day and night.The additional light feature takes this fan's utility to the next level. It illuminates my tent generously, adding an element of safety and convenience to my camping experience.But what really steals the show is the 20000mAh battery. It lasts for an incredible 60 hours! This long battery life gave me peace of mind during my multi-day camping trip, reducing the need for frequent recharging.The remote control and timing function were the cherries on top. The ability to adjust settings from a distance made night time adjustments effortless. Moreover, the shaking head feature allowed me to spread the airflow evenly across the tent.Overall, the 9-Inch Portable Rechargeable Camping Fan with Light has elevated my camping experience to new heights. Whether it's a weekend getaway or a week-long adventure, this is one camping accessory I won't be leaving home without. Five stars all the way!",

I love that the fan oscillates so that it covers a larger area. It also has an adjustable angle. The light is nice and bright and is dimmable.I took off one star because the first one arrived broken. It wouldn't even turn on. The manufacturer quickly replaced it though. The plastic also feels like it would break easily.",
