Then back to the desk where it can plug in via USB to the PC and it's seemingly back to full shortly the next time I have to get up and attend something on the floor.It clips to a monitor, it clips to a clipboard, it clips to random poles and shelves. Middle speed is fine when you're stationary and it's uncomfortably hot, and juicing it to the highest works for even when you're moderately active. It won't save your ass if you're out roofing, but if you're somewhere without AC it's a godsend for when things get too hot out or you need to be more active than normal.It's quiet too and fine for the office. High speed is noticeable, but only you will notice the second setting, and if you're just sitting around at your desk often the lowest setting is still plenty (and that's super quiet).No complaints. I'm sure the battery will lose it's maximum capacity over time. And I wouldn't mind if it weighed a ton and had a giant Li-Ion pack inside (even if it costed a ton more) or if it accepted replaceable rechargeable batteries. But for cheap Chinesium, this isn't actually a horrible mistake. In fact, it's great!",

                "reviewText": "The fan has good power and the 3 different power settings are nice if you need the battery to last a little longer. But the battery life is good and it charges quickly. It charges on USB-C so if you have a battery bank for your phone it can power the fan for a long time. I use this for quickly defrosting and drying my freeze drier and it works great. The clamp is strong and it has foam cushions to protect the surface you're clamping to. It is also very easy to direct it exactly where you need it to point. Its very quiet even on the highest power setting. Nice product.",

Charge lasts a few hours on a medium setting and a couple hours on full high setting.I\u2019d love for there to be a better way to clean it because I am noticing dust build up but I am a musician and use this outdoors in the summertime when it\u2019s hot. Clip it right onto my mic stand and position it at my face and it\u2019s quiet enough the mic doesn\u2019t pick up the noise but powerful enough it keeps my face cool in the sun.And it\u2019s baby pink and freaking cute! I also use it by my bed when I sleep and leave it plugged in and running all night and it\u2019s the perfect amount of white noise and feels excellent. I would 10/10 gift these to other musicians for outdoor events or just friends looking for a nice rechargeable desk fan! It also stands up on its own which is another plus if you don\u2019t have anything to clip it onto.Love love love it so much. Great little super powerful fan. Especially for someone like me who overheats easily. It\u2019s awesome \u270c\ufe0fyou won\u2019t regret your purchase!!!",

Anyway we plugged this bad boy into our router USB port and with the push of the button we were off. Then the rapid cycle came back. I wondered what I could do, I went to turn the fan off, and it sped up! Perfect! I wondered if there was more, and IT GOT BETTER! the high mode is truly impressive for this little guy and worked perfect for what we needed, no more rapid cycling!",
