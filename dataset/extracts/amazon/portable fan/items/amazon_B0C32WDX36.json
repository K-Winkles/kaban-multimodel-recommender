                "reviewText": "I love the fan except for the glowing blue light. I use it as a bedside fan; I run warm. So having it next to my head I need to block the bright light. I have a heavy sock on that portion of the fan so I can use it without hurting my eyes. That light is your battery meter. When it\u2019s connected to an outlet, the battery glows repeatedly to signify that it\u2019s charging. would be great to be able to turn it off",

I expected it to live in my camping gear, but I have had it running in my workshop and even in the house when we've lost power! the fan is strong but also dials down nicely if I want just some air circulation. I have had it run for a few days before needing to recharge it. The light are also quite nice. having the different qualities of light is nice to have. all in all I was quite impressed",

                "reviewText": "Last summer I bought several different rechargeable camping fans and this one was clearly the best out of all of them. Battery life is good, fan is quiet although not incredibly powerful. I found the tripod convenient for directing Air at myself or to the ceiling of a large belt tent. The ability to hang it is also a nice feature. The light is sort of a bonus since I use it mostly for the fan. Sort of sad this item is currently unavailable as I would definitely like to pick up another one.",

You can turn off the green charging indicator lights when sleeping, which is a bonus!10/10 recommend.
