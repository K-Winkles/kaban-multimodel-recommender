This was bought for use on a stroller, but I have also used it in the house when in the kitchen or at the computer desk. Nice strong fan, and the portable nature of it as well as the flexible legs makes it very handy.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely LOVE this fan! I take my baby out in the stroller a lot so I needed a fan for the summer heat. I came across this one and we are obsessed. It lasts a long time on a single charge (long time=I haven\u2019t charged it in a month). The fan actually blows cold air out, is quiet, and the rubber feature that attaches to the stroller works great! Comes with a usb charger and I usually will just charge it over night when needed. HIGHLY recommend if looking for a stroller fan this summer!",

                "reviewText": "Update: stopped working completely and will not hold a charge or start trying to charge. We only used this for working out and it was plugged in to the peloton all the time. Annoying. Not repurchasing.I bought this to use on our Peloton and it works great! the battery life is amazing - I charge it once a week just because I HAVE to have a fan to work out, but I don't think I necessarily have to charge it that much? I use it daily for about an hour at a time. It has never died on me, which is amazing! My last fan I was using had to be charged every 2 uses or it would spontaneously go kaput. My husband left this one running overnight and I was able to still use it without a charge the next day! (We only use level 1 or 2 power though, for some reason I find with small fans that level 3 just kills the battery, but 1-2 are perfectly good and last forever.)Only minor issue is that it rattles - we thing the way it's set on the legs somehow or the clips on the side are the source of that noise. It's fine if you have headphones in or are working out and other noises going on, but my hubs has said when I'm working out with headphones, it bothers him if he's in the room. So, might be something to consider if you, like other reviewers, use it for a baby seat or something.",
