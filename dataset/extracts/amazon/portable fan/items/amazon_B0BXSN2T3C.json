                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently purchased the GEHEN Portable Clip on Fan, and I am so impressed by how powerful and versatile they are! The fan is e rechargeable, battery-operated, and have a 10000mAh battery capacity, which provides ample power for extended use. This is my second purchase of a GEHEN fan, the previous one was a clip on USB powered Desk Fan that I love, so I had no reservations about buying another fan from this company.The fan is also incredibly quiet, which is perfect for use in an office or bedroom. The sturdy clamp allows me to easily attach the fan to my desk, bed, or even my camping tent or chair. Plus, the 360-degree rotation feature allows me to direct the cool air exactly where I need it.This fan will be a lifesaver during the hot summer months, keeping me cool and comfortable no matter where I am.I would highly recommend this fan to anyone looking for a powerful, quiet, and versatile personal fan. It'sa 5-star product that has exceeded my expectations in every way, and looking forward to keeping me cool!",

One fan stopped charging- seller responded immediately and sent a replacement right away. Fans are a little particular about the type of AC usb adapter you use - the small older style 1\" cubical adapters seem to always work, some newer ones don't.",

Has multiple levels and has good battery life. Provides plenty of air flow/wind to keep you cool. I love it!!The fan screen did keep popping off, but fir the price a couple drops of crazy glue solved that problem.",

I got this fan as an alternative to using my big fan at night as well as for work. Tonight its really warm so I decided to crank it to the max only for it to behave in this manner. It holds a charge well but u must use the correct charging box to charge this fan. So no android charger will work on this device. Other than that defect, it's really good but I wish I could \ud83d\udd0b power it to the max.",
