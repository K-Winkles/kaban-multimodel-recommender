What a mistake going that time of the year. Temperatures hit 100 and felt almost 110 every day. If it wasn't for this incredible gadget I would have probably ruined our vacation. I shared it with the kids and it truly helped during that oppressive heat. The airflow is impressive. I originally wanted a more expensive fan but this one did wonders. I plan on purchasing more on our next trip. Worth the buy especially if you are not a fan of super hot weather. LIFE SAVER! One of my favorite purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical about paying this much for a fan but it really is worth the cost. I wanted a fan that was stylish that I wouldn't mind wearing on my walks at work in and out of the building or on my walks with my dog at the apartment complex. I liked the look of this fan. I was happily surprised when I received it to find out it was very high quality. I live in Louisiana and it is unreasonably hot here. This fan doesn't solve the problem but it does help. Especially, as I overheat easily. It blows just enough air to keep me cooled down on a 15 minute walk. It has three speeds and the highest speed is really great. So far the battery life seems to be good, but I haven't had it that long. I definitely think this product is worth the cost.",

                "reviewText": "7/28/23 I plan to use it over my neck and hanging at my chest at a gym that has no air movement that I can feel. I wear noise cancelling earplugs that play my music and I doubt very much if the little bit of white noise this makes will be heard by me. The fan is very quiet on low power. Of course it gets louder when moving more air. But that's not to say it's ever loud. It's powerful enough to blow leaves from the driveway :-) . OK, that last was a lie, but for any normal personal fan use I can't see it not getting the job done.After it arrived I immediately plugged it in and it was fully charged in about an hour.It's small and light enough to be unobtrusive and unnoticeable. So far I just can't see it not doing what I want it to do.If anything else should need further reviewing either positive or negative I'll be back. So consider no news to be good news since so far I like the little unit.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried many small personal fans, trying to find something that is very quiet on the low setting so I can inobtrusively use it in quiet classical concert rooms, church, or at fine dining places. I had quiet little gentle fans 5 years ago, but the company stopped making them. All I have tried run at least 35 db. This one advertised it is <24 db on low, so despite the high price (3x what comparable fans cost), I ordered this. It is unfortunately not quiet , it was 35.8 db at 1 meter, we measured with a db app, which is audible not just to someone sitting near you, but across a 12 foot room -- i.e., just like others. On top of that, its cooling power was less than cheaper units sold on amazon. So I have returned it. For the price, it offers no benefit.",
