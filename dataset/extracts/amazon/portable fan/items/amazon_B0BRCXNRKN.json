                "reviewText": "9/8/23 review: I have only had this fan about five weeks now. It really has been a \"game changer\" for me while off-grid this past summer in north Florida. I received it 7/31/23, after the annual heatwave. It puts out a lot of wind. I cooled off my cabin with my air conditioner (powered by gas generator) and augmented cooling by placing this fan bedside, on Speed 2 and oscillating 45 degrees to sweep the length of my body. After cooling cabin down to 75F, I turned off my AC (shut off generator) but kept fan on, keeping me comfortable while temp outside dropped to low 80s/high 70s, equal to inside temp and cool enough to open windows later on (when nature called). The fan's sound lulls me to sleep. It stays plugged into my power station sipping 3 to 5 Watts while charging and operating on Speed 2 which is a gentle breeze from 5 feet away. (Energy consumption preferable to Ryobi 20\" fan on Low using 13 watts or a 9 Ah battery, 7 hours.) The remote is a nifty bonus now that I have moved the fan five feet away due to cooler nights as summer wanes into autumn. I let the fan battery discharge completely by mistake once because I had not properly plugged it in while moving it about eight hours earlier. After plugging it back, it recharged fully in about three hours while still operating on 2. It is tiltable up/down, made of sturdy plastic, lightweight and efficient. The light has been a helpful nightstand lamp.",

                "reviewText": "This fan exceeded my expectations. It works well, long battery life (thanks in part to the brushless motor), it has an ultra bright light, convenient remote control and a complete array of settings to make it versatile in all use cases. My only complaint is that the hook on the bottom is hard to get it and I feel like I\u2019m going to break it every time. Otherwise this is a perfect little fan.",

                "reviewText": "Just got this in today and RAN to write a review! We purchased this because typically we cold weather camp however we have recently purchased a camper. The camper has a wonderful ac but it\u2019s texas, it will randomly be over 100 degrees here at any given time. honestly, it\u2019s even happened in the cooler months at times. That being said we needed to make sure we prepared accordingly. This little powerful treasure from the camp gods is perfect! We received it today, it was about 75% charged but let me tell you this little baby packs a heavy hit in a small package. I had it turned on while I tinkered with the settings getting to know the little fella. I got so cold I had to turn it off. The light is bright but not bright enough to mess up the camping vibe. It hardly makes a sound yet really has a lot of power.This means we will still be able to hear nature and potential critters we don\u2019t need around the campsite (feral hogs in texas) so for us this is more than just fun for a fan it\u2019s also incredibly functional for it\u2019s intended purpose. I will try and come back to upload photos/video once it\u2019s in the set up. My only regret was not purchasing two while they were on sale! Get the fan y\u2019all !",

The osculating feature is great for pushing cool air all through the tent and the light being able to dim is great as well. I also loved the fact that it has a remote so that while laying down and relaxing I didn\u2019t have to get up to turn the light out when I was ready to fall asleep. I definitely recommend this little fan and will be purchasing another one in the future!",
