                "reviewText": "i ordered several fans like this, and this is one off the better ones.Compact size but effective. Very good breeze and fairly quiet.The only thing I wish it had was a flat bottom so it could be set on a table or counter. This fan would have to be hand held to direct cooling air to where it is needed, but that is probably what one would be doing anyway.My wife and I have a hot trip coming up and we plan on taking this and another fan I like just a little better. That model has a flat bottom and also a flashlight, same price. These are small enough that they take up little room and are very light weight. Having two will help to guarantee that one will be charged and working.One fan I am probably not taking is a cube style that I thought would be good to hang around the neck and have it blow at your face. The air flow was not nearly as much as the \"lolly pop\" type, and would have to be hand held to get the meager air flow to where it was needed. It also cost significantly more than this model.My opinion is that if you buy the QQT Mini Handheld Fan, you won't be unhappy. This is a great little fan. Now if you buy the Gaiatop Portable Mini Fan, you may be just a tiny bit happier. Both are great. Only time will tell which one will last the longest or provide the longest run time (both have a 5100ma battery.)",

                "reviewText": "This handheld fan has 3 speed settings. I found that the middle (second press of the power button) is the best for me. The first setting does move air, but the second setting moves a lot more air and is not a lot louder. The third setting is kind of loud, but does move even more air.I charged the fan and then let it run continuously on the second/middle setting. It ran for about 3.5 hours before shutting off. There was still a charge left in the battery, as I was able to turn it on again briefly. For something that I anticipate using maybe 5-10 minutes at a time (just to cool off), I think the 3+ hours of runtime will work well for a day of use.The fan is shape and weight is very nice. The handle portion of it is smooth and round, making it easy to hold. There are no corners or sharp edges.The fan came packaged in a box, wrapped in a plastic sleeve and even included instructions.",

I\u2019ve had others that were just battery powered and expected this to be about the same, but did choose this one due to reviews indicating it is powerful and the battery rating. When it came I gave it a quick test before fully charging (it does have its own charging cable which is nice) and packing away. I hit the button and was surprised it was a bit better than my old ones. Then I hit the button again and it got better, and the one more time to highest setting and let me tell you - this little thing moves some air! I haven\u2019t had a chance yet to check the battery life, but being rechargeable, I typically have a power bank with me to keep it charged up but I can\u2019t yet really evaluate battery life.",

There are 3 fan speed, the lowest is probably not useful, but medium and high fan speed works fineI put it at medium and it ran for about 2.5-3 hrs with a full charge. it ran slight <2 hrs at the high speed setting. I suggest using medium speed, it gives you an extra hour and give you a decent breeze",

                "reviewText": "My family and I will love this so much this summer! The heat waves in the summer are no joke and there were so many times last summer I wished for a fan. I didn't know these existed, so I took a water bottle sprayer with me.If we go to a park, outdoor activity, or just get in the hot car, these are perfect! You charge it with a USB cord and the power button is also the speed control so that is simple. No assembly or installing a battery. The 3 speeds are low, medium and high and it is quiet. The pink is soft and sophisticated in tone (not bubble gum bright).It fits comfortably in the hand for adult (even with arthritis) or child. We will put these in a travel bag in the car and have them ready to use wherever we go. Great invention!",

                "reviewText": "So super impressed! For being a small sized fan this thing really packs a punch. Has 3 speeds, all producing quite a breeze, but the highest speed knocks it outta the park. I\u2019ve had desk fans that were huge compared to this and they didn\u2019t even produce this kind of airflow. Made well, of sturdy plastic, not flimsy at all and not that silicone / rubbery material that gets sticky several years later. Again, super impressed. Would highly recommend. \ud83d\ude0a",
