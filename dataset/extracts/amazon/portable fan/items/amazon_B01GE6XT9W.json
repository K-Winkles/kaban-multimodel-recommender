So far I\u2019ve taken it to friends houses & college and it literally fits anywhere so I would definitely say it\u2019s super light weight.

I have used this to paint my elderly grandmothers nails and it\u2019s great since she has arthritis and often gets the polish everywhere while it\u2019s still wet. This fan got the nails dry super quick and I was able to use this fan for myself to do my lash clusters as well. I use this to set my lash adhesive once I\u2019m done with the application process as well as when I clean my eyes in the morning. It\u2019s also a cute little fan for a hot day.

                "reviewText": "I am shocked at the thousands of rave reviews on this fan. Not sure if mine is a dud or what but its compact size is all that is good when it comes to this fan. This fan only has one speed (most others have at least 3), the air blows out super slowly, and it feels like there is no power to this fan as I literally have to hold it one inch away from my face to even feel it. The narrow air vent area is too narrow that the the air only hits one tiny section of my face at a time so I have to constantly move it to reach all areas. It has a kick stand but that\u2019s pointless because I sat it down on my nightstand with it pointed towards my pillow you couldn\u2019t feel anything. My nightstand is not even 5 inches from my pillow. Definitely won\u2019t be using this fan to cool down. If it wasn\u2019t so inexpensive I would have returned it but the return shipping costs would be more than what I paid.",
