                "reviewText": "This small fan (blades 3.5\" across, actual fan 6 3/4\" tall x 5 1/4\" wide) is swivel mounted so you can tilt the fan up and down. There is a permanently fixed USB-A cable about 3 feet long and a single button on the back of the motor which acts as low-medium-high-off. There is a pinpoint sized hole near the button which allows a blue LED to emit light when the fan is on.On low, you barely feel the air moving 8 inches from in front of the fan. Medium creates a light breeze felt at 2 feet. High can be felt at about 4 feet as a light air movement. Since I use this on my desk to keep the air moving, I usually use low and medium. The fan is very quiet, but light weight so it is easily knocked over. The base is hollow plastic, but it does have 4 rubber feet to help keep it in place. Since it runs on USB, I have it connected to an open USB port on my UPS port, so no dedicated power plug.This isn't a high end product; and likely won't last more than a year; but for the sale price often offered (around $5 US) it is perfectly fine.",
