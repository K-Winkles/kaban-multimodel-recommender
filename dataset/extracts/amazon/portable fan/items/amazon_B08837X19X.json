                "reviewText": "The foldable oscillating fan I recently purchased has been a convenient addition to my summer essentials. Its portable and small design makes it easy to carry around and store, allowing me to use it in different areas of my home. The fact that it is battery-operated adds to its portability, eliminating the need for a power outlet. The fan operates quietly, creating a soothing breeze without any distracting noise. Another great feature is the inclusion of a remote control, enabling effortless adjustments from a distance. However, the fan's battery life is somewhat limited, requiring frequent recharging. Additionally, it cannot be left plugged in, which can be inconvenient. Despite these minor drawbacks, this foldable oscillating fan offers great convenience and functionality, making it a worthwhile choice for portable cooling needs.",

                "reviewText": "This fan is great in theory. The first one I ordered on May 22 lasted until TODAY (a day after I requested a return on my 3rd on, which lasted all of 3 hours before dying). I bought a second one for a co-worker after he admired mine. It died as well. Fan #2 died AFTER the 30 day return period, so, I ordered a replacement, which I recieved a few days ago and it died in the water within 2-3 hours. I am returning fan #3, but am now the owner of 1 fan that lasted May 22-Aug 15 (just died today), One fan delivered June 20th, which I bought as a gift for a co-worker and it only worked for a few weeks, and now a fan that was a replacement for fan #2 which lasted 2-3 hours, died, and I will get a refund on. Fan #1 was awesome while it lasted, and you can buy an extended warranty for for $7.99. I wouldn't think to buy a $7.99 3 year warranty on a fan that's priced at $38, but DO IT if you're going to buy this fan! You'll probably replace it 20 times ovee that span! I ended up buying myself an amazon basics fan and will just use it on my desk at work with an extension cord. Just ordered my Co worker a plug in fan as well.",
