                "reviewText": "it looks just like it looks in the pic, it takes 4 hours to charge, its kinda heavy, it has three fan speeds but the instructions say keep the charging port up and if u do that it does not work good at all like 1 star, but if you turn it uoside down it becomes 3 stars although i havnt used it outside yet. i wish i woulda bought one of the first ones i was looking at (that was water resistant with a long lasting battery) but i was in a rush and couldnt remember which one i liked best, and this one was an \"amazon choice\" so i figured it should be decent, but instructions said something about adjusting the fans by turning them but cant turn anything on this neck fan sooo..... yea overall i give it 2 stars because im afraid if i sweat it will break and its only effective inside on level 3 of 3 or high.the solid one works but if its hot its not all that and when your walking it just doesnt feel like its really blowing on you, if its hot outside.but the twisty on feels like your can angle it to get air to where youll feel it, i havent taken it for a walk yet.the big differences between the somid one and the twisty one is the weight and the breakability feeling. the twisty one doesnt feel like you are going to break it but the solid one does like if you try to twist it or shove it in a purse or backpack.but the twisty one which is just plyable on the back neck area is pretty decent. i do wish the air came out of the holes in the back neck area but hey its not too bad especially if you git a good deal on it.update: the first 1 they sent died litterally 1 month after i recieved it, it came in a box that said update but the fan didnt have their name on it, the second one rhey sent had their name on it and hasnt died Yet but its only been 2 weeks....",

                "reviewText": "I decided to buy order these at the last minute because my girlfriend and I were attending an outdoor sporting event. This was last month (June) in South Texas during an insane heat wave. The heat index that day was >110\u00b0 so this was a perfect stress test. It did... ok. In the extreme heat I had to turn mine up to full speed to notice any meaningful cooling effect. This meant the unit getting pretty loud, but with all the hubbub around me nobody else said they could hear it. I personally didn't mind it, but I also have a fan constantly running in every room of my home purely for the ambient noise so I might be in the minority when it comes to the unit's noise not being annoying.Unfortunately, my unit ran out of battery before the event was over; I got maybe a little over two and a half hours on the highest setting (out of 3). My girlfriend had hers on the medium setting and hers lasted the entire 3-3.5 hours we were outside. I haven't experimented with it or anything but I'll bet it could go at least 6-7 hours on the lowest setting. The only problem is it barely feels like anything on low, so why bother?Thing is, this was like $20, and you really do get what you pay for. It did an ok job and I'll be glad to have it if I need to spend any more prolonged time outside during this miserable summer, but looking back I probably would've invested a little more on a more powerful unit. If Amazon had half stars I'd rate this a 3.5 but since I have to choose I'm gonna just give it a 3 because of the disappointing battery life.",

However anyone with normal hearing is not able to \u201cjust take out the hearing aids\u201d BUT I am ok with it as the relief is worth it. Now I have had this for only a few weeks and so far I am very happy with it. I do charge it regularly as you have no idea how much charge is left in it as it just basically stops working when needs a full charge.",
