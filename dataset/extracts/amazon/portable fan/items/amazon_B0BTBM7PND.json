She loves this fan and it really helped keep her cool in 90+ degree weather.It has multiple speed settings and can run for hours on one charge (Yes! It\u2019s rechargeable!) I love not having to buy batteries. This fan has some serious grip to it! Used it on walks, attached it to the stroller, lawn chairs, you name it! I had people asking me where I got it. It\u2019s durable made with hard plastic that I would not expect to break when dropped. It\u2019s heavy for a portable fan but the grips hold it up very well and is super easy to adjust.Stop looking, you\u2019ve found what you need!!",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a fan to use in a classroom. I needed a portable fan with rechargeable battery as I am not always subbing in the same room. I've wasted too many AA batteries with other handheld fans and the kind worn around the neck. (Fans are classroom must have when it's not A/C season.)So, I bought this fan after I bought a similar one that was not oscillating. For a few dollars more, I now have an oscillating fan with a natural wind function in addition to low, medium, and high speed. I've used this as a tripod (hat tip: use the rear leg to steady the front by bending it like a fish hook facing outward). Also, I've used this with its legs wrapped securely around a wooden TV tray leg.PROS:\u2022 All the fan speeds serve a purpose and function very well!\u2022 Oscillating on a handheld fan! Are you kidding me?!\u2022 Long battery life (be prepared to charge more often if using highest speed)\u2022 Can operate while charging! Seriously!\u2022 Very bendy, strong legs!\u2022 Can twist off faceplate to cleanCONS:\u2022 Does not have a separate on/off switch (so be careful how it's packed to avoid accidentally running the fan)\u2022 No battery percentage indicated (this would be a major bonus)\u2022 No advanced notice the fan will stop (when battery is on empty, it stops... This is why a battery meter would be handy)Otherwise this fan is perfect! Get it!",

The durability could be worked on, seems like it wouldn't hold up to a high or multiple drops. But at the price point, can't complain.",
