                "reviewText": "I am SO glad I bought this fan!!! It's spectacular, and I've been using it every day since I got it.The fan is very small and portable, so I can take it with me wherever I go. It's also very quiet, so I can use it in the office without disturbing anyone.The fan has 5 speeds, so I can adjust it to the perfect setting for me. It also has a built-in LED display that shows the battery level, so I always know how much juice it has left.The fan is rechargeable, and it comes with a USB-C cable. I can charge it from my computer, my phone charger, or even my power bank.Overall, I'm very happy with this fan. You could say I'm a HUGE fan. (pun intended LOL)",

They were in a week long dry spell so there was no afternoon showers to keep the temps down and it was unbearably hot. This fan pushed a good amount of air and the digital power meter meant I could confidently use it throughout the day without fear that the battery would die on me. I definitely recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "This fan has a few features most of the others don't have: A tiny battery strength meter display that tells you % of battery charge. That doubles as a momentary fan speed display (1 thru 5!) when you select a new speed. It also has a foldable battery /handle that doubles as a hand held handle or a stand that should hold the fan upright on a table. And, it has a removable strap that is supposed to hang the fan around your neck so you can have it blowing on your face (that's where most of us need the blowing air, right?).BUT...1. That strap thing doesn't hold the fan right side up on your chest! The fan keeps flopping over sideways! No way to make the strap function useful!2. The shipping is TERRIBLE! I like the fan I have, so I ordered a new one on June 8th, and it won't be delivered until 8 days later! June 16th! It was 3 days before it even left the source in Baltimore, MD, and from there, they predict 5 more days to get it to Las Vegas. And, I'm a premier Amazon customer paying a big fee for fast shipping of all items ordered. Let's hope they can ship one of these fans faster to you!",
