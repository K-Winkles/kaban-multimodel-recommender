There is sounds with it but it is not annoyingly loud. I love how small it is to fit in your purse as well. The best part was that it is a portable charger as well. The battery seems like it lasts a while and I only have to charge it every few months if I don\u2019t use it frequently. The only thing is that it doesn\u2019t let me charge my phone anymore. The usb plug seems to not be working anymore. It is a bummer because it was very handy to use when my phone was about to die.",

                "reviewText": "This is an effective little cooling device and I like that it's rechargeable (not battery operated). The only suggestions would be to make the opening process a bit easier (it's oddly tricky to open) and to make it more square in order to place it on a surface and not necessarily have it hand-held. I sometimes brace it against items on my desk to have the cool breeze on me while hands-free. But that doesn't always work well... All in all, though, I'm happy with this purchase.",
