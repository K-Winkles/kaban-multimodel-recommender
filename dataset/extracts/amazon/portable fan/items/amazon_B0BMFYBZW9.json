                "reviewText": "it has a flat profile so slips into my bag without being bulky. it is light weight. at the highest fan speed it isn\u2019t noisy. you can feel the breeze with each level and feel the difference. it charged up quickly too. i charged it up when it arrived and tested it. no problem at all. i use it on my bus ride home and even it the highest setting it wasn\u2019t loud or noisy to bother anyone seated close to me. i would have returned it if noisy like a small hair dryer. i really love that the fan handle and the fan face is almost flat instead of big and round like other hand fans sold on amazon. the only thing to be careful not to accidentally touch the on switch when putting in bag or moving things around in your bag. i am extremely happy with my purchase and i love the soft mint green color too! this is a very affordable fan to own for days when the bus ventilation is out of order or when waiting on line where there is very little ventilation. it would be good if there was a way to temporarily attach to back of a cell phone. the handle was long enough that i was able to hold fan and my cell phone and had fan running while i was using the phone to watch video and to send text messages, that\u2019s how flat there can handle is and i have small hands. very good purchase\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f",

I have some funky health issues that make it difficult for my body to regulate heat, and I was worried that I would get heat sick at an outdoor concert in the middle of summer. This thing was a perfect solution - it fit really well in my small purse (but had a large strap so I could put it around my neck), and it actually was very effective! It has since been to baseball games, festivals, and renaissance faires, and I still haven't had to charge it again. Love it!",

Loved the 3 speeds and the battery life was great. Lasted all day. The only negative thing was the stand was not very stable and didn\u2019t like that I had to remove it completely from the fan and re-attach it in order to make the fan stand up. Stand seemed a bit flimsy plastic and I was afraid it would break, so didn\u2019t bother to use the stand part. Aside from that, the fan was good.",

                "reviewText": "First I must say this is the best item I have purchased all year!! I tend to be warmer than most, including my husband. This fan charges on the same charger I use for my phone. It does come with it's own short charging cord. The amount of air flow is unbelievable. The 3 speeds will meet anyone's needs. See photo:. I roll a small pillow up and lay it against my nightstand.Then I prop the fan on the rolled pillow, lying it on it's side, and turn it on to blow on my head, my body, wherever. The sound is low and soft like a sound machine. I do leave it plugged into the cord (mine) if I use it for any length of time, including overnight. The sound is relaxing.I own a second one for an end table by my chair in the family room. And now I keep a 3rd in my purse for those places you walk into and the heat is set at 80. Lightweight and easy to use. Cool off and treat yourself. You'll wonder how you lived without it!! And the price is low.",
