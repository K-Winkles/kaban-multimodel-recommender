                "reviewText": "So I bought my first pink fan around Jul 2022 and a black fan for my husband about Mar 2023 BOTH FANS ARE AMAZING !!! This is an honest review from someone who has had the fan for awhile. Pros: Charge does last EXACTLY as advertised! Ive used my fan overnight (a lot actually) on level 2 and it can hold up with no charge needed, but you can have it plugged in on its charger and still get good air it won\u2019t hurt it from what I noticed and again this is from someone who does this ALOT! This thing is POWERFUL! This thing is small but mighty the air is such a cool relief on a hot day. Easy to travel with and store in my purse to come on the go with me\u2026sometimes I take both. I was able to fly with both of my fans on an airplane! (YES the smaller ones are travel sized) I just want to EMPHASIZE on how much air this thing really blows out! As long as you keep it clean (I clean mine with a few qtips to knock off the dust, hold the blade with one and clean with the other to get the blades I imagine an air duster could probably do the same but that\u2019s not what I was working with) the blades are sturdy, the fan is also pretty sturdy to be small I\u2019ve dropped mine more times than I count and it works just like it did first day!Cons: my pink fan not long after I bought it started making a louder sound while on (still does it to this day, but not annoying loud, just noticeable because it was super quiet before) and I would like try to tap the back which worked for a minute but seems to be no solution for but my black fan still sounds silent. There is not an easier way to clean this fan\u2026we can\u2019t take it apart to simply clean it and snap it back together which is weird because it gives that illusion, the charger that my pink fan came with seems to have a short in it and I have to wiggle the charger a bit if I use the original charger, but the black fan charger one is still fine, but the charger is one of those universal chargers that you would probably have a lot of.Small Cons Lots of pros I only have the small ones for now but these fans are AWESOME! EverytimeSomeone sees me with my fans I never fail to let them know it\u2019s from here! The price is honestly a HUGE DEAL!! Buy you won\u2019t be disappointed!!",

                "reviewText": "I work in a clean room where we're required to wear the coverall bunny suits. The suits are made with the intent to keep human particles (ie: skin cells, hair, lint, etc.) from contaminating the environment and equipment. There are times when you can really work up a sweat and the clean room suit only makes the situation worse. It's comparable to wearing a plastic bag around you, retaining all your body heat and odors (gas lol). I always accepted being hot and miserable - folding a piece of clean room paper in half and fanning myself, or putting my face directly into an exhaust fan on a piece of a equipment for relief. I finally came to my senses - duh moment - and started looking for a fan. I needed something that was small and portable as my ergo station doesn't have much real-estate for my tool-kit and other necessary items let alone a large fan to keep me cool. It needed to be portable/cordless as well due to our cyber security protocols. This fan met all the requirements and it has been the best $16 I've spent on an item for work. This little guy packs a punch, it's like being hit by an ice beam. I set the angle of the fan so that the stream of air hits below my chin and neck area and man it works wonders with cooling me off after getting warm.The fan has three speeds, all of which I use throughout my workday. I tend to have it low when I'm setting up for the day to keep me cool and if I start getting warm I'll adjust the fan's speed as necessary. I'm pretty good with turning the fan off when I leave the clean room for break or if I know I'm going to be away from my ergo station for a while, so I've had no issues with the fan dying on me when I need it. Battery-life is a non-issue for me, the battery seems to be powerful enough.I also appreciate the rubber pads on the bottom of the fan to keep it in place, along with ability to oscillate the fan where you need it.The design is simple, yet aesthetic and pleasing.If you want something small, quiet, powerful, and portable, get this.",

                "reviewText": "My mum's had one of these for a couple of years now and loves it. When she told me it keeps her cool at night I decided to get one because I've been keeping my desktop fan on at night which (a) is a bit noisy and (b) uses up electricity. This is neither noisy or uses electricity, apart from obviously when it has to be charged which only takes a 2-4 hours, depending on how much it's been used of course. I doubt that takes up much electricity though. I love this little powerhouse of a fan. It cools me down during the day and night. I get quite hot sometimes at night even in cooler weather and will use this then too. It reminds me a bit of a Dyson fan, although not quite as cooling as they are the gods of fans are a hard act to follow. I'll call this Dyson's cousin :) It's got three speed settings and honestly, the highest speed really cools me down. I then switch down to the second speed then the first. When these come back in stock BUY ONE! There is one that looks virtually identical that is in stock as I type this made by OMASI",
