                "reviewText": "The Reenuo fan is an impressive little product. It's marketed as a \"camping\" fan, which certainly makes sense. It's small and light weight, which means it would be easy to pack in and out of a campsite. The fan has settings for multiple speeds and provides a surprisingly strong air-flow for its size, a built-in LED with 3 brightness settings (which will provide plenty of light for anything you might need to do in your tent after dark), a hanging hook (which folds flat into the base) so you can set the fan on a flat surface or suspend it from an overhead support if desired. The fan housing, itself, can rotate 360 degrees on both the horizontal and vertical axis, allowing you to aim the airflow exactly where you want it. Though it is marketed as a camping fan, I actually bought to add to a post-hurricane emergency kit for use in any power outage situation. Luckily, I haven't had to use it in that kind of scenario yet but I'm confident that it would perform well and be a welcome piece of equipment in an emergency of that sort. One thing, specifically, that supports that expectation is that the two rechargeable (and easily accessed and replaceable) 18650 lithium batteries that the unit includes are still showing a nearly full charge 6 months after the fan was added to the emergency prep kit. That's some pretty impressive storage performance and means a high likely hood that the fan will still work if a power outage catches you off-guard and you didn't have a chance to prepare by charging up all your batteries to max beforehand.",

                "reviewText": "Reviewing from Alaska, I've used this mostly to get some air circulation in the tent while camping on weekends. We've had a really mild summer so far (50s and 60s with the odd 70s day temps) so I've found it most beneficial when I need to cool off while/after pitching camp.Pros:+ The battery lasts a long time. I don't know if it meets the stated times but it's longer than I've need so far in overnight camping.+ It is small and light and easy to lose in all the camping gear.+ It moves a good amount of air. The second setting is great for when I'm trying to get a fire started and general use in the tent.+ It is pretty silent until you get to the highest setting and even then it isn't loud.+ The built-in folding hook makes it easy to hang from the center hook in my tent or folds into the base to set on a desk/table.Cons:- I wish it came with a remote or some tactile difference between the FAN and LED buttons. Or better yet, a button for the light and a dial for the fan.- It uses a micro USB connection to charge in an era where everything else is USB C or fruity hold-out's connection.- It's a bit bulky. I would have really appreciated if the fan holding arms were straight and collapsed into a flatter package or could roll/tuck the base into the fan assembly. It takes up about as much space as my compressible sleeping bag does in pack/trunk.Meh:~ The rubber feet are standard stick on so expect to replace one or two when they get rubbed off in packing.~ The lowest fan setting can hardly be felt a couple of feet away (which is why I mentioned starting the fire with the medium setting).~ I have knocked the folding hook loose from the base a couple of times but it snapped right back in.~ The lowest setting of the light maybe work as a night light (though this hasn't been an issue during Alaska's summer \"nights\"). Even at its highest everything else I carry which has a light, including power banks, has a brighter light.It's small enough that I plan to bring it with me when I travel. May update it in a few weeks after I come back.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been really pleased with the purchase of this little powerful fan. I mainly use it inside of our home sauna to create better airflow, but I saw in a lot of reviews people using it for camping and other outdoor applications, which I have no doubt it\u2019d work great for as well. With 3 power settings and 2 LED light settings, you have the flexibility to meet your various needs. I\u2019ve found that I like to use it on the second fan setting as that\u2019s more than enough to create some air circulation in the sauna. I charge it every 4-5 sauna sessions of 20-25 minutes each, and have never had it run out of battery yet.",
