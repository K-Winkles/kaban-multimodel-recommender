Not only a fan but also a charger I was able the charge my phone 5 time while running the fan on mid speed for the whole day unlit returning to our hotel where I later charged. I didn\u2019t think that the sole panel did much but it does work I put it to the test by running it on high speed for about 12 hours walking on a hike and I still was showing almost full charge so it does work. Thank you for such a great product I\u2019d highly recommend to anyone and everyone",

                "reviewText": "For those skeptical because of the price, worth every penny. The belt alone was a deal breaker for me it's actually nice and I wear it everyday with or without the fan. Very quiet on 1st and 2nd speeds and not extremely loud on 3rd (highest) with very nice breeze. Battery life is awesome I fell asleep with it running, woke up hours later with 2 out 3 bars still left. Ive used it during the day while using it to charge my phone and still doesn't decrease battery as quickly as most power banks ive had in the past. Haven't needed to use the solar panel yet but will update when I get the chance to use it. Great buy don't settle for the cheaper ones spend a few more bucks and be satisfied with your purchase. Thank me later lol",
