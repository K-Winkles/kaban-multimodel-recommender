One example: when I wash tiny bottles or vases, I put them in front of this little fan to dry before putting them away. The battery seems to last forever, and I just can't recommend it enough.",

My favorite feature is the Hold switch like we had on our old discmans so it won\u2019t turn on while in your bag. Also it\u2019s pretty strong, I keep it on speed 2 and that\u2019s perfect. Speed 3 is a little loud but not annoying, it pushes good air for about 2-3 ft. I did a battery test, on low it ran from 1:38 am until 4:30 pm. That was the last time I checked the fan and then dozed off for about 15 minutes and it had shut off within that window. So it got about 14-15 hours of runtime on low. Charged back up in 3 hours. I also like the little kickstand that keeps it pointed at just the right angle when set on a table. It\u2019s just a good little compact fan with a big battery to last you your whole outing.",

                "reviewText": "I had a couple other folding compact fans to carry around that worked okay, but they were still kind of bulky when they were folded because the handle swiveled around to \"fold\". When I would throw those in the backpack to carry around, they were still bigger than a tennis ball size. Those other fans also only charged with a micro-USB cable, which is sorely outdated at this point. The rechargeable batteries inside those fans are not replaceable and they stopped holding a charge, so I needed to find something new.This JISULIFE Handheld Mini Fan is exactly what I was looking for because it is compact and flat (smaller than my travel battery pack), charges via USB-C (just like most of my other devices), and it has a kick stand so I can set it on the table while angled towards my face! I love that there is a separate on/off switch, so it won't accidentally turn on while bouncing around while in my bag. Bonus points for the lanyard loop and included lanyard if you don't have one. I hope this one will last a long time because it has been great so far!",

I was a cute little fan since it's not big and bulky and doesn't take up too much space in my purse because of how flat it is! I did find that because the fan had a smaller battery, I couldn't have it on the 3rd mode all the time because it would run out of juice.The fan was powerful but it wasn't as strong as I liked. I had to keep the fan close to my face in order to get the most out of the fan. In simple words, the wind isn't straightforward, it is spread out so if you want to get the most wind, you have to bring your face close to the fan in order to stay cool.The fan works well and perfect for what it is, it's just not as strong/powerful as I wish it was. I will still continue bringing this fan out whenever I travel because it is nice and convenient to have on had as to not.",
