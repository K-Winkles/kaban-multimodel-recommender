                "reviewText": "First of all, this fan should be handy in ALL kinds of applications - not just on a baby stroller! It can be used on a desk, in the car, on a lawn chair, at the game, and more! The clip works as a stand on flat surfaces like a desk, but it also clips onto poles, stands, or metal tubing, so you can mount and direct this fan to almost anywhere.It comes with a USA-A to USB-C cable for charging. I have plenty of USB-C cables already, but it's nice that they include it. There is a small L.E.D. light on the back which shows the charging status. It blinks green while charging, and turns solid green when fully charged.It might be small, but it is a mighty fan! While testing the fan, I had it on the high setting for a few hours. When I passed through the room where it was running, I was reminded that it was running because I could feel the cool breeze, even though I was about 10 feet away from it!My testing showed that the fan will run for about 2 hours and 40 minutes from a full charge. After that, it might run a little longer on a lower setting. It will blink the green light to warn that the battery is low.One strange feature is the \"ears\". If you look at my photos, you'll see that there are two \"ears\" at the top of the fan. They have a concave shape, as if they are supposed to look like ears. My guess is that they use the same plastic molds for different fans, and another model is a cat-shaped fan. Either way, it doesn't affect the performance of the fan, and perhaps it makes the fan more friendly for kids if you use this fan on a baby stroller.I was pleasantly surprised with the features and performance of this fan - especially with the low price point!",

                "reviewText": "Item: GOTOTO store Clip on FanPrice: $9.59 after 20% vendor discount on 02 06 24There are features of this fan, regarding versatility of mounting that caught my attention. The base of the fan allows you to set it flat on a table. Incorporated into that \u2018flat\u2019 and on bottom, is a metal clip for hanging the fan. And finally, the fan base is a spring-loaded clip. The spring-clip does require some force for opening. Once open and at the end, you have about 1-3/4\u201d distance from top to bottom. Because the mouth of the clip is at an angle, your usable opening to hold onto an open edge of a table, etc., may be limited to something \u00bd\u201d or thinner. But you do have that flexibility. And the fan can rotate a full 360-degrees on the base-clip. All in all, a very small and versatile fan. I do like the heavy build. Having a number of these small rechargeable fans, this one does appear more capable of \u2018rough handling.\u2019 Overall a nice addition to our small fan collection and very utilitarian.",

                "reviewText": "I got several of these fans to use while working out at the gym but I also plan on using them when we go to the beach in the summer. Overall these fans work well and they have a very small footprint and are very compact and easy to transport. They charge pretty quickly and the battery easily lasts several hours. I like that I can clip the fan to various things or you can just position it flat and then rotate the face a full 360 degrees. The fan is small enough that I can also easily slip it into my pocket while yet still produces a powerful stream of cooling air. My only criticism is that the spring clip is a little small so you will be limited in what it can be clipped to but you should be fine as long as the mounting surface is less than 1/2 inch thick. Also the stream of air that this fan produces is pretty narrow due to its small size so this is more for \"spot\" cooling and not cooling a wide area. Overall I like the fan but I wish it had slightly larger fan blades to produce a wider path of air but other than that I am quite happy with it. It should also come in very handy while travelling in the car or plane",

                "reviewText": "The small rechargeable portable fan arrived today and it is very nice. We can see many uses for this handy little device. It can be used in the kitchen when you are cooking and need a little breeze! One of the things we plan to use it for is to put in our shower each day to help dry it out and cut down on any mold growing. It is neat that it can sit on a table or it can also clip on something. I love the rechargeable feature as well as the 3 speeds. I give this a big thumbs up! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd70Thanks for reading my review, I hope it helps!P.S.

                "reviewText": "I got this fan to use outside while I'm fishing to keep cool in the summer. The clip is very strong and the fan is very powerful for something as big as your palm. This fan is charged by USB-C and takes about an hour to fully charge. There are 3 settings that you can switch between; I prefer the second setting myself. All three settings are pretty quiet and if you're using this for a stroller, it wouldn't disturb baby at all and might actually act as a bit of a white noise machine depending on how loud the environment you are in is.Would definitely recommend as either a stroller fan, or as a portable clip fan if you frequent the outdoors.",

                "reviewText": "This fan does what it says... it provides cooling from a mini-fan. I really like smaller fans like this for their versatility and the fact that because they are rechargeable, I don't need to constantly be popping in new batteries.We have put it in our guest room, and clipped it on the nightstand. Between that and the overhead fan, this should keep guests cool. It should be noted though that when they say \"mini\" it really is mini. It is really meant to be used by one person who is not too far from the fan. But they make that all very clear in the description and pictures.",
