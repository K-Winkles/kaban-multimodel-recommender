                "reviewText": "This neck fan has been really helpful when my hot flashes come. I like having 3 power levels but honestly the intensity at level 1 is all I really need. This neck fan is both lightweight and comfortable to wear. A full charge will last a long time!The only negative remarks I have is the placement of the power button and the noise level. You need to be careful when toss this fan in your purse or gym bag because you can easily hit the power button and run the battery life out without even knowing. On low the noise level isn't bad but medium and high can be a bit noisy.",

                "reviewText": "It has three settings, and it works really nicely. Definitely cools you off, but keep in mind, it blows the temperature of the air in the room. It will not cool you off if you are outside in 90 degree weather. I use it at work in an air conditioned environment when I get too hot from running around too much. It actually does a good job of cooling me off pretty quickly and keeping me comfortable. Keep in mind that you will only get about 2 hours of use from a full charge (I usually have it on the highest setting) Maybe you will get a little more time out of the charge if you use it on the first or second setting, but probably not much more. It's pretty comfortable; not too heavy, but you will feel it on your neck. It sort of looks and feels like headphones resting on your collarbone. The only downfall to this fan is that you can't plug it into an electric socket to charge it. It is USB charge only, which isn't a huge inconvenience but it does put a limit on where and when you can charge it up.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these for work and there is zero way these are travel friendly in my line of work. It has worked out great on walks in the neighborhood, outside etc or at an event even. They are relatively quiet, though I\u2019ve heard some that were better in that department. The bendable and flexible area is nice. It has three speeds, but the button is on the top, so I sat them on a shelf and had something on top, kept hearing a buzzing noise, it was the fan going off, so button is really sensitive. The other issue is these are heavy duty and that makes them not lightweight. That is why I said they are not necessarily travel friendly. I am going to try another brand as well to have a few ready to grab and go, but these are of good quality, just heavy. Definitely would NOT fold up and fit in a purse easily unless in another bag so button wasn\u2019t accidentally pushed.",

I picked it because I have long hair and I didn't want my hair to get caught in the fans, so I liked that it was bladeless. It does have multiple fan speeds but it didn't feel cool because of the angle the fan was blowing. I tried wearing it in different positions but it felt uncomfortable on my neck and made me feel a little claustrophobic. I also didn't like the placement of the buttons, I kept on hitting them by mistake. Maybe this didn't fit me correctly and might work better for someone with a longer and slimmer neck.",

                "reviewText": "I am an excessively hot person. I sweat like crazy, get super overheated, and get sick from being outside too long. I was the leader at my daughter's week long youth camp this past week. I spent 12 hours a day outside.. Hiking, spending time at the lake, playing games. I didn't die thanks to this neck fan!!! I am in Texas, and it gets HOT. I will say, that when we were at the lake, and in direct sunlight, it wasn't cool air, more warm air being blown back at me. But this was SO much better than nothing at all. It is circulating air, not an air conditioner.I also want to add, that this DOES appear to have blades. When I tilted the fan upwards more towards my face at times, my hair tugged ever so slightly. But the fan part seems to be so covered up, that it didn't suck my hair inside or anything.There are vents along the whole neck piece, so it isn't blowing just from the front, like a lot of other fans do. I charged at night, and it lasted all day long.I can't say for longevity, as I have only used this a week, but it served it's main purpose for me. $20 for a week of no heat stroke is a pretty great deal, even if for some reason this decided to never turn on again. It is still going strong for now.It can be slightly loud, and I can never hear as it is, so if there is something you really need to listen carefully to, you may need to turn it down. I would just turn it off intermittedly when I was talking one on one with someone and it was getting too loud. It really isn't an issue though.I have had spinal and cervical surgeries, and this did not hurt my neck at all. It isn't heavy, and didn't cause any problems on that end. When I took it out of the box, I thought it may be too heavy, but once wearing it, it felt light.It comes with it's own plug, and it charges quite quickly. You just need to use your own wallI highly recommend.",
