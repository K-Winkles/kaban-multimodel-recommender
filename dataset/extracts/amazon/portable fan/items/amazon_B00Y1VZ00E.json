                "reviewText": "Where has this been all my life? I never write amazon reviews, but I was so impressed with this product that I just had to make an exception...I am a chef/manager so half of my time is spent in a hot kitchen, and the other is spent in an almost equally hot office. I was looking for a USB fan that could give a little respite and I absolutely hit the jackpot with this one!Where do I begin? On its lowest setting, this fan provides a gentle breeze from almost 2 feet away. It is quieter than most computer fans. Second setting is something similar to the highest cool setting on the most powerful hairdryer you've ever owned. A shade louder but completely unobtrusive and still easily felt from 2-2 1/2 feet away. The third setting is more powerful than some regular fans that I have owned, and still pretty quiet at that.It is charged via USB and it uses the same lithium ion battery that is found is most e-cigarette vape mods. In a pinch, you could take the battery out of your vape and use it to power this fan. Plugged into a USB charger/port it charges whatever battery is inside it. So if for whatever reason... if you wanted, you could conceivably stealth charge your vape battery. Plugged into a USB port the fan also works without any battery installed at all. You can also take this battery and put it in your vape battery charger if you have one and charge it that way.A fourth click on the \"on\" button turns off the fan and activates an LED light on the side. It isn't as bright as the one on most smart phones these days, but I could see it being useful in certain situations.At any power setting, if you hold down the \"on\" button for 4 seconds, an LED illuminates the blades in the center of the fan. It is a cool looking effect, though I wouldn't personally use it unless it was plugged in as it would just put additional drain on the battery.Finally, it is a nice compact size. That is perhaps is the most impressive part, especially considering how much power it has! I have included a picture of it in my hand. Admittedly, my hands are a little on the large side, but it would still slip easily into a laptop case or perhaps a purse. It is only about an inch and a half thick.If you're looking for a small USB/battery powered fan you should get one! It's FANtastic! :)",

                "reviewText": "I recently went on an over 10,000 mile road trip where space was at a premium in my car, and I have no regrets bringing 2 of these fans with me. Sometimes it's nice to have that extra moving air in places where the AC doesn't work well, or family members don't like to keep it as cool as you like. These fans are very portable but surprisingly powerful for their size. I kept the packaging and used it to pack the fans for going from point A to B, and that kept them from being damaged. They are not really thick sturdy plastic so they require some care not to damage, but I have dropped them several times without any damage or loss of function. Very useful purchase!! -J",

I have one on my desk and another one blowing into my desktop pc case to keep the components cool and long lasting. The one I got that had the battery had low battery life. Otherwise if you keep this plugged into the usb it works great. I rated portability at 3 stars because battery doesn't last long at all. Maybe a hour at full speed. It is very compact and small though.4 out of 5",

                "reviewText": "I live in Arizona so I'm usually surrounded by heat or trying to escape it. I've tried quite a few different small fans. I get hot and sweat easily, and this was the only small fan I found that did a quality job of cooling me down. I brought it to work with me and used it at home daily except the, maybe, two months it was cold in Arizona. It is quiet. For it's size, it holds quite a bit of power, so it generates a lot of air flow, which I have not been able to find with any other small fan I've tried in the past. Because of how efficient it is, you also do not have to be super close to it to feel it, which has been an problem for me in the past with other small fans. So, you can sit comfortably without it blocking your way while working. You also feel a cool air because the amount of airflow you receive, which is yet another problem I've encountered in the past with other small fans.I'm very impressed. The quality has also lasted for as long as I've had it - maybe 1-2 years now. Definitely recommend, especially for the price.",
