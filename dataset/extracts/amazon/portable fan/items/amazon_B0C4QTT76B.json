The charging cord that I received with this product then stopped fitting securely in the charging port making it impossible to recharge. I would not recommend this product as it does not perform as advertised.",

This neck fan is a lifesaver for summertime walks., the beach, I\u2019m really anything else done in the. It allows him to stay comfortable much longer than he ever has before while outside in the summer heat. I don\u2019t know how we survive without it before.",
