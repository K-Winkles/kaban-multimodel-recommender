This has 3 settings and the lowest one is usually good enough for me and the 3rd setting is hella strong. Comes with a little stand so you don\u2019t have to hold it but u can also take it out and walk around with it. Doesn\u2019t help that much outside in the sun with heat and humidity but works really well inside. Works ok outside but it\u2019s not going to cool u down that much esp if there\u2019s wind",

This fan was recommended by Amazon as a replacement for my other one that stopped working, but it is twice the size. So don't trust Amazon recommendations all the time. It will fit into a huge pocket like medical scrubs, but it still sticks out a little. Motor is strong with the 3 settings and it sits in the holder easily. I do like the pink color. Charge lasts for days.",
