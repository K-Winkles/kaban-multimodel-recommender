                "reviewText": "Needed a fan to put on my desk at work and though that this one might work... Well, it \"works\", but I had to work around the fan, not the fan work for me.First off The fan is slightly more bulky that I had expected, even after watching videos. To be clear, this is not a small fan, but it is not huge. but this fan is intended to be more of a small shop fan. So far, decent fan, runs quiet, good air flow volume, in general, function great as a fan.So that bring me to what I don't like. The fan clicks into 5 static positions, approximately 18 degree increments from 0 to 90 degrees, or straight forward to straight up. There is no downward tilt, so you will need to have an incline if you want a slight downward direction. This was not really illustrated in the videos, though now that I know, I can see they never demonstrated it as a feature, so I can't gripe.Another thing that isn't really shown is that you can hang this from two anchor slots on the bottom back of the base, so you can ceiling mount or wall mount the fan, though I would be leery of a \"sideways mounting, as the anchors are designed for the weight to go forward in relation of the fan, so if you were to wall mount it, I would make sure it has a downward tilt, unless you are supporting it in another manner.Other than fan motor itself, everything is mechanically manual. No oscillation/turning motor, no \"natural\" speed setting, just off, \"light\", medium, and \"it is messing up my hair\" speeds (0,1,2,3). Would be a great fan for mounting on a ceiling to circulate air or an easy to use floor fan. Personally think it is a hair too big for a desk fan though.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this fan to replace a full size oscillating fan for my bedroom. I find myself extremely impressed by the amount of air this little fan can move. I have it about 15 feet from my bed and was convinced I'd barely feel it. That was not the case at all. I think the output is equal to, or greater, than the previous one I owned. I like the compact size, it's neither too tall nor wide nor deep.There are only 2 minor drawbacks to this product:1. It's pretty loud on the highest setting and makes things near it vibrate, which also causes more noise, which isn't great.2. The dial switch is on the back and isn't the most intuitive place for it to be. I will give the dial credit though, it's way more heavy duty than I expected, which is a pretty big bonus.Even with the minor drawbacks, I'd certainly buy another one if I was ever in the market for one.",

                "reviewText": "Needed something a little more quieter for my bedroom fan. This fits the bill perfectly! With 3 speed settings, instead of the normal 2 settings on most portable fans, I usually use the medium speed. That way there's good air movement and some dampening of sound, but not too much to not be able to hear if there is an emergency in the home. Love this!",

This one fills that niche... kinda.As is common with fans nowadays, there are only three speeds and they are in reverse order (off, strongest, mid-strength, weakest). I would have preferred for the lowest speed to be a little slower, because the fan is relatively noisy, and worse, it vibrates quite a lot. I have to put it on something soft to absorb the vibrations or I can feel them through the floor (and it makes additional sound).Otherwise it appears to be fine. It doesn't take much space, can be oriented 90 degrees to aim directly up, and circulates the air more than enough. I just hope it's durable.I would have given it 3 stars, but as it's one of the few fans that are of a sensible size/cost (usually it's either super cheap desktop fans or super expensive and encumbering big fans), I'm raising it to 4 stars.",
