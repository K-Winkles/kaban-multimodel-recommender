                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is the most powerful handheld fan I\u2019ve ever seen. This turbo fan has 5 powerful speeds and comes with a charging cable & wrist strap. I\u2019ve used it to set make up, to speed up the drying process of wet nails, and when I travel. I haven\u2019t had to charge it yet as the battery lasts long on a single charge. This fan meets the definition of a TURBO fan. On the lower settings its quite powerful and runs fairy quietly but as you increase the speed, it does get a little louder each time but not too loud. It\u2019s really not until you get to the last two speeds that you\u2019ll hear a louder whirring sound (see video). The fan is sturdy even when on the highest speed. The parts are made of a very thick & durable plastic. It\u2019s roughly an inch taller than an iPhone 13 Pro for size reference. It\u2019s not heavy but the handle part has a little weight to it due the battery inside.",

                "reviewText": "I am an intermediate level watercolor artist and I was looking for a fan to use to dry my work in between layers. This fan honestly surprised me. The reviews that I read said that it was a good fan and it was a powerful fan.They were right.This fan has five speeds, is USB-C rechargeable, and while it isn't small per-say, it's not large. It's small enough to sit in my art supply box and not take up a bunch of room.It's not \"Knock a guy out with one whack\" heavy, but heavy enough to feel sturdy. It's got a really good hand feel. The weight is mostly in the handle of it. I assume this is due to the battery and motor. I could hold this in my hand for a good part of the day. (I will come summer and with more watercolor paintings)The third and fourth speed drys my paper in a reasonable amount of time.WHO BOY the fifth speed of it almost (almost not quite) blows my watercolor paper away if I'm not holding it. While holding it, it does dry it (obviously) faster.I can't speak on the battery life as I have not had it long.It is a surprisingly powerful fan and I will be buying a second one once pay-day hits.The ONLY cons I have to this fan:-There is only one button. You have to cycle through the 6 clicks. 1-5 speeds and 6th click turns it off.Once you get the hang of clicking it fast through the modes it isn't too bad.-The wrist strap is hard to hook though. Doable, just hard.If I have more I'll edit.Very glad I bought this instead of an artist-eccentric one as this is much more versatile.",

I purchased this fan after I read the reviews and read that it has five speeds vs the three speed fan I already have. The air curculates well. For a small fan I was surprised that it had the power to keep me cool. I use the fan daily, I wish it would blink when the battery is getting low instead of just shutting off. When I use the fan for a short period the battery can sometimes last two weeks. I try and charge it at the end of the week overnight so it will be charged for Monday. This was worth the money, after using this fan I won't use another fan. I also wish the charging cable was longer. Luckily I have a longer USB-c charging cord.",

In the attached video you can see how it can move the pages in the manual.I still cannot comment on longevity or battery life, however as others commented, it has a half charge when new so you can use it right away.It does feel solid.",

There are five power levels and it is pretty quiet on the lower settings but with the power this fan has it is impossible for it to be quiet at the higher fan settings and believe me if it is hot and you want to cool off you want the air blowing and you will just have to sacrafice quiet to make that happen as it is impossible to have a quality fan this small not be loud but still it is not annoying in any way. The next best thing is that it is rechargeable with a C-type recharging cable so no waste buying batteries here. Highly recommend this one it is the best!",
