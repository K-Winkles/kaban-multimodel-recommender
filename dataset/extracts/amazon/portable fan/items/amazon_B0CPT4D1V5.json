Once a month, we have a manicure day where three of us do manicures for the ladies. Our biggest need has been a way to dry their nails after we paint them so they don't get nail polish smeared or on themselves. We usually use a piece of paper folded to fan them. Hence, the need to get this little fan! The Kidee fan has three speeds from low to high. You just push a button on the back of the fan to the speed you need. It will be easy for me to hold the fan and dry the ladies nails and so much easier than using a piece of paper. If the battery gets low, you just plug the charger in that comes with the fan and let it recharge. I am very satisfied with this product, and it's going to work with me tomorrow!",

So far I'm impressed with the KIDEE Portable Handheld Fan.It's very helpful that it doesn't use batteries, but charges via USB cable instead (included). It can fully charge in several hours, and the charge can last most of the day on the lowest speed. It has three speeds, and even the lowest speed quietly produces a strong and steady stream of cool air.It's slightly larger than my smartphone and fits easily in my purse or carry-on. The hook at the bottom is perfect for attaching to a lanyard or the latch for the airplane tray table. It's very lightweight, but still feels sturdy and durable. The price is comparable to similar products.I took a star off because it would be more convenient if the on/off/fan speed button was located somewhere more easily accessible, like on the handle or on the front of the fan, instead of the back. It would also be great if it came with a stand, but otherwise I recommend this!",

You just press the button on the back once, twice, or three times depending on the fan speed you want. While it is powerful even on \u201clow\u201d it is kinda noisy. I like that there are no batteries to fuss with as it is recharagable. This will be a staple in my purse in the warmer months, Essp at work before my job before they turn on the air conditioning.",

You\u2019ll need something to protect the on button if you carry it in your purse (it\u2019s small enough) as it is just a push button on the back and will easily get turned on and drained as things shift in a purse. Overall happy with it but haven\u2019t tested the usage time yet as it\u2019s winter and this is bought for on the boat in summers.",

I've been needing something to cool me off when I'm bowling, and now I have this. So happy with this find, and would recommend anyone else to get it. I used to have a piece that plugged into my iphone, but it wasn't really powerful. Now this small yet powerful fan will keep me cool while bowling, and while outside this summer.",

It gets a bit louder with each speed increase, but even on high, it's not distracting to others.Women of \"certain age\" definitely should consider this hand held fan! It's definitely going to be a huge relief for me when away from my house!",
