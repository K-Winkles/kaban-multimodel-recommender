                "reviewText": "I bought my first one back in June of 2020 and really liked it, since then I have used it in various locations in the house for various purposes and it'd been rock solid. I just recently bought another and although some slight cosmetic and port changes in the back panel it seems to have maintained the same quality. Frome someone that now has two of these and has been using one of them since 2020, I would highly recommend this portable battery-operated fan. See my pros and cons below:Pros:- A surprising amount of airflow from this fan- Variable speed control- Relatively fast charging with the included USB cable- Durable and Reliable- Easy clip and swivel fan head- Pretty quiet on the low-med speeds but much louder on the high speeds, to be expected through- Long battery light, uses an 18650 which comes with it, easy to replace with spares when needed.Cons:- A little loud on the high setting, again to be expected for the amount of air it pushes. Maybe a design change to the fan blade with a feathered edge for sound reduction.This portable fan is worth the purchase!",

I was very pleasantly surprised! Don\u2019t let its size fool you! It blows way better than previous small fans I\u2019ve purchased and has a dial that adjusts the strength you want on the back. It\u2019s quiet and the clip on feature makes it useable just about anywhere! AND, it\u2019s rechargeable! It comes with a usb cable to charge it. I bought one for my living room and I liked it so much I bought another one for my bedroom and just now purchased one for my daughter!",

                "reviewText": "Current usage update: So, we had bought 3 of these fans and now, after two years, we are down to just one now. Although they are great, they just don\u2019t last. Keep in mind we use them for about two hours at a time and maybe once a week on average. One, with the dial on the base and two batteries had just stopped working and the other one with a single battery had issues with the usb connection. I think it might be soldered poorly and makes intermittent contact which worried me so I stopped using it. I am about to order another. Regardless, these are pretty great when functioning. The only irritating thing is that if they are plugged into an external battery the fan speed is poor compared to when it is just running off its own battery. I even tried removing the battery and running it but still runs poorly. We just keep them charged and run them full blast and plug them in when we stop. On camping trips in the north east, these are great for the kids. Our external packs kept them running all night. Hence my average on 2 hours once a week. We don\u2019t use them during the winter, spring or fall.UPDATE: SkyGenius had contacted me and offered to replace the fan. The new one came in and I had turned it on and let it drain. After it drained, I had recharged it and it worked again just as long. The output is great and fairly quiet. Our baby likes the extra air movement when she's in the stroller and we have to cover her up due to the sun. She's a ginger with sensitive skin. I'd give SkyGenius a perfect 10 in trying to remedy this faulty fan! Customer Service was top notch.I bought this fan exclusively for our road trip to Boston for when our 13week old baby needed a little extra air. It worked great until the battery die after first use and I tried to recharge it. It never recharged again and the light (assuming a light that shows the charging status) never comes on. This this is now useless and I've gone past the return period since we were traveling for a few weeks. Junk. At least this one.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: immediately after I wrote my original review (see below), the seller contacted me and made arrangements to replace this fan with a different model. So this revised review will talk about both this fan, the Sky Genius Battery Operated Clip on Mini Desk Fan, and the slightly larger, but just as excellent SkyGenius Battery Operated Clip on Portable Fan for Bay Stroller, USB Rechargeable 4400mA Battery Powered Mini Desk Fan (Max 32Hours) , that Sky Genius replaced it with.Though the company did replace my no-longer-working-right fan with a different model, let me say that I would still highly recommend this one, especially for using it on a desk. Its speed and air flow are truly excellent--I rarely had to turn it much above the lowest, highly adjustable speed setting--its battery keeps for a decent amount of time, and it is very, very quiet.My problem--and the reason it got 4 (and a half) stars, instead of 5--was that I had the fan clipped on top of my bed's head board with the main part of the fan facing down. While the fan worked wonderfully for about a month, the constant movement of the fan's blades, coupled with the placement of the micro USB port on the back of the fan, caused the charge port to shake loose. Eventually, the fan got so wouldn't run with just the cord or charge the batteries, because the cord could no longer connect properly. Since the single battery only lasts about 6 hours if the fan is on the lowest speed, even finding a way to charge the battery wasn't my idea of \"fun\".Another issue that mattered at 3 AM, but not if you are using the fan on a stroller or desk: the fan's on-off/speed control switch is on the back of this fan. Let me tell you, finding that switch at 3 AM, while laying down and desperately trying to put out the flames of a raging hot flash, was a grounds for some SERIOUS cussing. The other model of this fan that Sky Genius sent me has a larger base that holds 2 batteries, and it has a front-facing on-off switch/speed adjustment knob. The micro USB port is also on the base, so it doesn't get shaken by the fan blades' movements. It's heavier than this model, but well-balanced, even with it hanging off my headboard.The gist of all this is, I would still recommend this fan to anyone who needs a small, lightweight, quiet, and surprisingly strong stroller or desktop fan. I've tried other small fans like this, and they just aren't as strong, or as speed-adjustable. I wouldn't hesitate to use it on my desk, or to drag it with me to the park or coffee shop, because air conditioning doesn't mean a thing when you suddenly burst into flames.By the way? As good as these fans are, you can't beat the Sky Genius' excellent customer service. Though I was ready to just be cranky and try someone else's fan (I did, in fact, and sent it back), Sky Genius contacted me and offered to fulfill their guarantee without any hassle whatsoever. I would gladly buy from them again,ORIGINAL REVIEW:Love it--when it works.Maybe I got a slightly defective one, but after using it for only a few weeks, its speed fluctuates wildly, even when it's running on AC. I'm using it as I sit at my computer desk right now, and I can barely feel its effects from only two feet away. The blades look like they're chugging along, but not much air movement is happening. Also, the adjustable rolling switch is an absolute pain when it's clipped to your bed, and you're trying to turn it on in the dark.I do like this fan's cooling properties, but if you're expecting it to be effective for more than a few weeks, you may be disappointed.",
