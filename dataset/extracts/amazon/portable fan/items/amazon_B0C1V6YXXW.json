My only complaint is the small red light when it is on: can make your room not quite dark. But it is really small and I am really picky so.",

It\u2019s not that bad, produces fantastic airflow, and is so small. I love that I can tuck it into a bookcase if need be!! I have a very hot apartment and this little thing has helped cool off my living room, definitely buy!",

However I was happily surprised how well it worked how quiet it was how easily it folded up and how long the battery lasted. I charged it fully and then turned it on high and it seemed to last up to 8 hours with a full charge I was shocked definitely an improvement from earlier rechargeable fans I have used.",
