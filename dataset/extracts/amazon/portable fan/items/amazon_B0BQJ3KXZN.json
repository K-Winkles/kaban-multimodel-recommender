                "reviewText": "Pros: - Doesn't way much at all - Quiet (on low) - Battery lasts for weeks (see below) - Compact - Timers so it shuts itself off - You can charge other small electronics with itCons: - Not very powerful due to very thin blades - Takes forever to charge - Easy to trigger the light when carrying it - Awkward to carry due to lack of handleI am being dead serious when I tell you that this fan was delivered to me on September 6th. I fully charged it and I finally got the low battery indicator yesterday October 11th, after using it for over a month almost daily. I would turn it on low and put it a few feet away from me in my camper van. It is super quiet on the low setting, but because of the thin blades it's not very powerful. It's decent, but because of the small size, it won't be as strong as say, a Vornado fan, for example. Few annoyances are that I kept pushing the light accidentally when trying to move/carry it because the button is in an awkward location. Not a big deal, but maybe they'll update the design for a later version. Also, be aware that because the battery is huge (20,000mAH), which makes it last forever, it only charges at a rate of 2A (amps). That's 2,000mAH, which means it will take 10 hours to fully charge once it's dead. You can't charge it any faster than that. Not a big deal because this also protects the battery and it will have a longer lifespan, but just make sure that you have 10 hours to dedicate to charging this thing once it's dead. You can also charge other things with it, which is cool, but it's at the same 2 amp rate. So very sow charge.Overall I've loved this thing and will look into their other products. I discovered this fan from a YouTube video from another camper van person and decided to buy it. One of the best products I've ever bought on Amazon. Have used it almost daily in my van and have taken it in my house as well because I run hot when I sleep. If you don't have a ceiling fan, this is is a good alternative. And because the battery lasts forever, you can run it for a few nights in a row without worrying about charging it.",

                "reviewText": "Very quiet, small, portable fan. Charged once, used many times, nominal power loss. I carry it outside and use it if I\u2019m weeding (Florida=hot), sat it at my feet when just sitting/reading outside, helps make this summer livable. I have a little dog that overheats, he likes the little fan as much as I do. Good product, sturdy, versatile. I may order another one for the dogs and keep mine for me. Good product!",

This is great to have something on a desk or to take outdoors as well. I received this well over a month ago and have only charged it once. Haven't used it heavily but, it shows full battery life still. Nice!",

My ONLY wish is that it blew a little harder. Don't get me wrong, it has 4 speeds and puts out plenty of air. If you're sitting right next to it, it's absolutely wonderful. The air blast just doesn't have quite the reach I hoped for but certainly not disappointed. Would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Glad I spent a little extra for this fan vs the others I was considering. It feels like nice quality and works perfectly. Helps to keep my pup cool and is quiet. I\u2019m surprised at how lightweight it is, making it easy to carry along.It arrived yesterday, we used it this morning and have already loaned it out to a friend heading to an outdoor concert. Will be incredibly useful and convenient. Will likely purchase a couple more.Re: video.. the fan blades appear to be moving slowly, when they are actually moving very fast, but the filming frame rate of the video makes it look slower.Edit: first weekend all on a single initial charge.. I used this fan for my dog as shown on the video, my friends took it to an outdoor concert and used it on max from 7PM-11:30PM.. then the following day we had a power outage in 97 degree weather, so I used continuously it for another 12 hours. It\u2019s still showing a full charge on the battery indicator! I\u2019m ordering 2 more and my friends who took to the concert both ordered one.",

I can use it bowling for league (3 hours) and the battery indicator still says full. Added bonus is it can be used as a lamp which I keep in my car and it can charge my phone. Definitely a good value. If noise is a concern though it can get loud if you set it to the top 2 settings but since I use it in a bowling alley where it's loud it isn't an issue.",

                "reviewText": "We recently used this fan to go camping and it last all night and the next day on full power. We also used the lantern part intermittently and it worked great as well. We were so impressed that I ordered a second one for my kids' side of the tent. It's very light and easy to use. I've also taken it tailgating to my son's Saturday morning soccer games and it was perfect for that as well. The tiltable head and slim design allowed me to easily wedge it in the corner roll bar of my husband's jeep. I am also happy that it uses a usb C charger since that is what most things are starting to use and it makes it easy for me to charge it and keep the cord available to then charge my devices from it when needed. Love this fan and hope it last for the long haul!",
