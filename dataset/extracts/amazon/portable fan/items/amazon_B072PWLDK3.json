The fan has two speeds which is nice. Although the strap was a bit hard to put on it\u2019s not impossible I just put a thin string through the hole and looped the strap and back out the same hole I put it in to pull it through. They had a nice selection of colors to choose from and I look forward to buying the rest as a gift for my family.",

                "reviewText": "Anyway, I love this little fan. I actually have two. It is a little on the tricky side to open because you need to get your fingernail in the dent to open it. It's not hard, and won't break your nails, but it might take one or two tries when you first get it. The fan moves just the right amount of air and is not loud at all. It was close to 90 in Mexico and the air felt so good on my face. It wasn't weak and it wasn't too strong. I will definitely be bringing this with me on future trips. My husband likes it to. I also like that it doubles as a charger and flashlight. I am a fan of anything that reduces the number of things I have to carry around when I am on an excursion or at a theme park.",

                "reviewText": "I keep this little fan in my purse and whenever I'm somewhere that's uncomfortably warm, I pull this out and it makes SUCH a difference! Enough people have noticed that I've sent them the link and they've since ordered their own. Battery life lasts a long time -as promised. It's small enough that most people hardly notice if I set it up next to my laptop. If the room is silent, you can hear the fun running, which makes me self-conscious. But if the room has people talking or some sort of noise, you really don't notice the sound of the fan. It's a little hard to open, and I've actually hurt myself trying to figure out how to both shove and pull at the same time to open it. Sometimes it can be unstable when set up on a tabletop. If you bump it, it's easy to knock over and then turn off on it's on.**It does very little to help with cooling outside. You have to hold it about 2 inches from your face to even feel the air moving. Inside, however, it works great!!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this with the intention of bringing it to WDW for a trip later this summer and wanted to check it out before then. It was quick to charge and I love the compact design - easy to throw in my bag and have it ready to go. Opening it the first time took me a second until I realized you could just push on where the ports are and it toggles enough to swing open completely - an easy method to get it open when it looks otherwise pretty sealed tight! The two speeds are nice to have (tho I tend to keep it on the higher one), and it is very quiet for the amount of oomf this thing puts out. I haven't used it as a battery for my phone yet but I appreciate that it can be a backup power pack if I should ever need one. Wish it came in black for my spooky vibes aesthetic, but that's just me ;) Overall, using this at a local renfaire and while traveling (it was a godsend in a warm airport terminal recently), this is a handy little fan that can provide some swift relief. I think it'll be perfect for the WDW trip later this year!",

If you touch them at all it really hurts. Don't even think about getting your hair caught in them. Overall a great fan.",
