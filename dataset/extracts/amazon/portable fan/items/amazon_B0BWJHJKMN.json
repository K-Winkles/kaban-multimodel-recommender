                "reviewText": "I bought this portable fan to have in my home office but also to take with me on work trips because I find myself hot sitting in long conferences and meetings. I wanted something that was quiet but strong enough to cool me down and this fan fits both of these criteria. There is some fan noise of course but it is not bad. There are 3 speeds and the lowest speed is strong enough for most of my needs. The charge lasts a long time. I was in a work conference and it lasted all day the first day and most of the next day. I think it might have lasted the second day but I went ahead and plugged it into my USB port to charge. Folds up for easy storage in my backpack. Super happy with this purchase.",

It saved us on the airplane tarmac when it was 100 degrees and no movement of air. It also saved us in our Airbnb and hotels where they did not have ceiling fans. The charge it held was amazing, so many hours. Plus it actually was a heavy duty fan and cooled you off. Didn't use the light but nice feature. Small but mighty. Fantastic purchase!!",

The light on this fan is not good and that is why I give it 4 stars, i bought this for the fan and the light was just bonus. The frame has a little too much slack and feels loose when positioning the head. Battery life is not very good but I leave it plugged in majority of the time so that isn't a problem for me. The fan does a good job and cools me off, it's a good buy in my book.",

                "reviewText": "Great portable fan. Recommend for vehicles, campers, tents, truck drivers, etc.Great for your significant other that gets hot easily at night while sleeping. For those women experiencing those \"hot flashes\".This fan is 7\" in diameter with a 3 blade propeller. Once you turn on the fan, green LED indicator lights up telling your percentage of battery that remains. 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. When you turn on fan you have 3 speeds. Low (25% LED indicator light illuminates momentarily), Medium (50% LED indicator light illuminates momentarily) & High (75% LED indicator light illuminates momentarily). Click a 4th time and fan shuts off as each press of the fan button cycles from Low, Medium, High, Off. Next to fan button is the light button. Again this has three settings. Low, Medium and High.Setting the fan on a desk with low setting cools very nicely only being about 2 feet away. Put it on high and you get the wind noise in your ears. You can still feel a good breeze from 7 to 10 feet away.For those campers or truckers that need \"white noise\" to sleep, this fan provides a subtle white noise on high that would definitely help you fall asleep.This fan has a small hook to hang it from center of a tent. It is lightweight so if you applied some of those 3M Command Strips to base, you have additional mounting options. The fan offers multiple angles so whether you hang it, mount it, or use on a desk or table, you can point the fan exactly where you want the air to go.Battery use is dependent upon fan speed and light level. Obviously low fan setting with no light on will offer longest battery use before having to recharge.Battery is 5200mAh.Hope this review has been helpful.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted an emergency fan for potential power outages, as we have had several here in NC. The added cluster of LED's are an added bonus & surprisingly bright with its 3- Low/Med/High settings. It had to be rechargeable, offer extended run times and have more than a single speed. It has a USB-C port which translates to quicker/reliable charges. It can also be charged via: it's included 21'' USB-C power cord from a vehicle/laptop/battery bank. Its built-in hook will come in handy. They're two buttons above the USB-C port, one for the fan and one for the LED cluster lights, very simple to operate. When the unit is fully charged, a series of 4-green lit LED's marked with 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% show the battery usage/status, this is incredibly useful in being able to know exactly and not try to make a determination as to how much fan/light power is available. Some serious thought process went into creating this gem. The only suggestion I'd make would be to have included a USB-C port door cover, to help protect the unit against rain/moisture/dust when in it's hanging position, (USB-C port dust covers, can be purchased for cheap right here on Amazon) Other than that, (PERFECT) After my initial battery charge a few days ago, I've kept it on at it's lowest (quietest) setting and the green LED lights are still at 100% !!! I have no doubt that the runtime on low is more than the advertised 25 hours, though, I am sure that if both the fan & LED's are used in conjunction with each other, battery time will be deminished. Another neat function is that the fan & LED's can be used at the same time or either one of them independently, whatever is needed at the given time. I can see using the fan to keep mosquitos/flies at bay from picnic tables, it's long runtime is a total plus. On another note, my reviews and observations are based on my personal experience with any given product I purchase on Amazon. I am not an Amazon employee nor am I receiving any form of payment/gratitudes from anyone. Just an honest assessment. I needed a fan for emergencies and I got an outstanding piece of essential equipment, at a very reasonable price.-",
