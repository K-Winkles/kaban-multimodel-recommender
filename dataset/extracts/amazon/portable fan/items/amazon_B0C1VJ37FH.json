My vision is 25\u201d wide x 75\u201d length x 6\u201d height.The sellers description is: 27.5\"D x 75\"W x 9\"HIt fit great length wise and the width, barely making it over the edge, which creates the height as you can see from the photo. 1 inch is uncovered, and the height of my cushion is 6 inches.The Sellers\u2019s description says it\u2019s it\u2019s up to 9 inches. NOT possible! Needless to say, it covered the majority of my cushion, which only serves as a platform for a mattress topper that I put on it at night to sleep on, so that being said, I don\u2019t care much and I\u2019m just going to use it, however it is less 1 inch towards the bottom, which you really can\u2019t see unless you get close. The price was very cheap and I should be concerned about that with future purchases, and look to invest in better quality. The material is cheap. It almost feels like half material and half rubber. There are many nice fabrics out there that they can use that are still stretchy. When you hold it up to the light you should not be able to see through it.To end my review, I just want to say to be aware that it will stretch to 75\u201d in length but no longer than that . Width wise it will stretch to 25\u201d and borrow a little bit from the height, but it will NOT cover more than about 3 or 4 inches in height. Definitely not 9 inches.",

This one fits what i was looking for - small, rechargeable, quiet, and it shows how much battery you have left. The only knock I have on it is that the battery does go down somewhat quickly but it does last several days without charging. There are different speeds and it\u2019s easy to charge. I highly recommend!!",
