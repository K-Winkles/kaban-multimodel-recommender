The charge lasted great, and it kept our baby cool. Would definitely recommend.I bought this to use at the beach, out at the pool, or on my baby\u2019s stroller. I used it once when we were at the pool. It worked okay, it died after probably 3 hours of use. I charged it when I got home, then the next time we went to use the fan it only stayed on for about 2 minutes and we haven\u2019t been able to get it to turn on again since.",

It can be fully charged and I\u2019ll turn it on and it will run for a minute and then stop. I\u2019ll have to hit the power button numerous time and it will come back on for a moment and then shut off again. I\u2019ve missed the return window sadlyUPDATE: I forgot to post this, but the company reached out to me after I posted the above review and offered to replace it. The new one has worked very well and we\u2019ve had no issues! Truly appreciate a company that stands by their products. I have updated the stars to reflect.

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. It took me a while to write this review because I originally bought this for my child. I could have bought a regular fan but I didn\u2019t want her tiny fingers to get stuck on the fan blades so I wanted a safer portable fan for her. I waited until the HEAT wave arrived to really test this product out. If you live in the USA this week has been a real scorcher. Some states had temperatures of 110! Crazy!So yeah I put the fan on her stroller, in the car, in a shopping cart, on hand or on a table. I couldn\u2019t be any more ecstatic! Truly a great invention.The blades are all blocked off so tiny little hands can\u2019t touch the blades. It has three modes when it turns on: slow, medium and super fast. It\u2019s still pretty refreshing and powerful even for a tiny little thing. It\u2019s pretty sturdy, flexible and bendable.I love that I can just set it and forget it. It\u2019s not that loud on level 1, and it\u2019s louder on level 2 but honestly I can\u2019t hear it that much when other noises in the background. But by no means can I consider it silent at all. If you\u2019re in your car you probably won\u2019t notice the noise. We forgot the fan in the car when we got out to go grocery shopping and didn\u2019t find out until I placed my child back in her car seat. So that should give you some sort of hint of noise level. I think you can only hear it if you\u2019re at home and it\u2019s super quiet. I think the greatest thing of all is how cool is it looks because it really doesn\u2019t look like a fan. I got lots of compliments on it and asked where i got it from.I made a video so you can hear the noise level.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve used this for the past 4 months now that we are in summer And use it on the weekends and it works great! Love that you can attach it to any stroller or chair and even use it on a table top. The COMPLAINT I have is the battery life is poor. It doesn\u2019t last at all. Now, I\u2019ve come to realize my charging cable they provide is no longer charging it, so that may be why it\u2019s not working at full capacity but I can\u2019t find any other charger to fit it.",

The power on button is pushed in the fan body which makes it hard to press the button. And lastly, the battery of this fan sucks.I woulnt recommend this stroller fan when there are others out in the market which are cheaper and functional.",
