                "reviewText": "We are currently being warned we will likely see power outages as the intense heat continues and taxes our already weak energy grid here in Texas. Since I can't move as fast as I like, I got this little guy to help out as we are also being advised to not set our AC's as low. I'd prefer to be warmer than comfortable rather than having no AC at all. My at home work space is right in front of a window. Blinds are down but hottest part of the day and it doesn't matter.This fan has only one setting, however, at that setting it blows pretty powerfully for a small appliance. I am using it as I write this and it is keepin me cool. I experimented and turned it off and the temperature and comfort is dramatic. It's definitely keeping me chill.The directions are in English and Spanish. For those who ignore directions lol, and open the battery compartement only to see two slots when there should be four - there is an added step - don't worry. You gently pull the string tere ad wiggle it out and the other two batteries go in the back side of it. Easy peasy.As an added bonus its kinda cute. Not Kawaii cute and believe me I spent hours over a few days deciding and I yearned for the cutest ones in pretty colors. However after looking at reviews and descriptions and pictures for so long I finally told myself to choose already!The not so good - depending on the person.There is a smell. I will say here I am super sensitive to scents. Don't give up on a great item though. Some items like organizers or clothes - I actually will set outside to offgas for as long as needed. And of course wash! This one had a strong chemical scent out of the box and when I started using but this dissapated immensely as I used it (turned a bit away). I feel confident that the odor will be medigated even ore in a few days.Sound. It isn't whisper quiet. I happen to like the sound but that is all preference. I have a fan by my bed all year round even in locales that actually have a winter. Partly for the noise. However, if you like fully quiet or close to, that is something to consider. I may have to not use when talking to people for work. However, I have been considering investing in a better pair of noise reducing headphones.I find it lightweight and compact, and my pictures show size comparison. However it isn't the lightest - it has a slight heft that I find reassuring. All around it feels pretty sturdy. It does have a stand that folds up - and with a very satisfying sound.All in all its a good purchase. I may get one for my son who does his work for his virtual science academy in a more sun protected spot but he might appreciate. Plus, if we do lose electricity. However, I kind of eventually want to try one you wear but not sure yet.I am happy with my purchase and may buy another. I may update if the fan stops working or to talk about battery life.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had this fan since 2019 and it\u2019s still going strong! It has traveled with me to several destinations near and far. I really appreciate how it has helped provide not only white noise but cooling effect when in warmer temperatures and climates. There\u2019s only one speed but I\u2019m not surprised as it\u2019s just a small and inexpensive travel fan. Highly recommend and would buy again. Haven\u2019t tried it much with batteries as I appreciate the dual use with a usb plug. Side note the fan is lightweight and easily folds down to be more compact for storage and packing. Enjoy.",

                "reviewText": "This little fan is what I use almost daily at my job because in the winter it's like an inferno, and in the spring, the ancient HVAC system can not adjust quickly to the changes in temperature, so the heat stays on until like June. (No, seriously. Ugh. )This fan has only one speed, which was a bit of a disappointment (I should have read more carefully). I wish it had a higher speed. It's definitely more of a \"strong breeze\" fan than a \"steady wind\" fan. It's not going to blow papers around on your desk. It's also a little noisy, but in a \"white noise\" kind of way -- you don't really notice the noise until you turn it off, and then you're like, Wow, it's suddenly so quiet.It's made entirely of plastic, except for the wires and motor. That makes it light. And it is quite small. When folded flat, you can set it on top of an 8.5\" x 11\" spiral notebook and it fits within the boundaries of the notebook cover. Quite small! But that makes it very portable. I can bring it with me from unit to unit at work, and it's not heavy at all.BUT what is GREAT about this little fan is it is incredibly DURABLE. My locker at work is over my head (a tiny locker, like 1.5' x 1.5' x 2') and I lost count of how many times it fell out of my locker over my head and plunged to the floor... and it still keeps working!! This is a repeated fall of nearly 6 feet -- or more. (I'm 5'7\" and have to reach over my head to get into my locker, and I have to stand on tip-toe to get things in the back of my locker.) But it keeps working. Each time it falls or I drop it accidentally, I'm afraid I've broken it -- but, nope! It still works.I can't really speak to the battery life because the second time the fan fell from my locker, the cover of the battery compartment broke off, and slid somewhere on the floor, and I was never able to find it again. I have used it exclusively with the USB cable ever since -- connected to whatever computer I'm using at work.But, in the short period of time that I used it with batteries, I got about a day and a half out of one set of batteries. But that was with the fan running my entire 8.5 hour work shift. So that's about 12-13 hours on one set of batteries. But, again, I only used the batteries for a short time -- no more than a few days.Since I've dropped this fan countless times and it continues to run great, plus its incredible durability and portability/lightness, for what it is, I think it's great for the price! I would love if it had a higher speed, but you can't have everything, not at this price.",

From the first moment I searched small usb and battery powered fans until the day London heatwave had reached mid 30s in my office or even a motorhome trip away in the summer heat of the Mediterranean sunshine; this changed everything. Its so powerful for a small fan, I usually powered it from my laptop or power bank (minimal battery use) or you can even go old school and use 4xAA batteries. This will go on for a few days before the batteries die. You can use it so you can actually sleep at night and attach it to things. This is the perfect thing to take on campervan and motorhome travels - Spaceships rentals actually hire them out now!I have not left my house without a Honeywell stowed in my bag, or hand luggage for that matter. I liked this one so much I bought more and bought a human sized Honeywell for my Appartment.If you aren't on this honeywell train yet, (yes this works on a sweaty London tube too) you'll be wishing you were. This has meant a number of things for my life.- increased productivity- decreased sweat- decreased heat- increased cool factor- I can now sleep at night, yes even in motorhomes or campervans!- it has saved my lifeGet onboard!",
