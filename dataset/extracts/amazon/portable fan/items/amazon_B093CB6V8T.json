Press the button on its back step by step to adjust the speed from low, middle to high. The low setting is quiet and the rest two settings are very powerful, which can produce quite strong airflow to cool you in summer.",
            "\ud83c\udf81\u3010USB-Powered & 5 Blades\u3011Connected with a 4.9-feet cable, the table fan can be plugged into laptop, power bank, USB wall charger(not included), USB hub and any other USB port. You don\u2019t need to buy an extra USB extension because the USB cable is long enough. Note: the USB cable is non-detachable. 5 blades make the airflow softer and more comfortable compared with 3-blade fan.",
            "\ud83c\udf81\u3010Mini Portable Size\u3011With 5.1-inch size and 6.2-oz weight, this mini fan saves space for your desk when working and studying. It\u2019s easy to pack it into your backpack or suitcase when traveling, camping and having picnic.",
            "\ud83c\udf81\u3010360\u00b0Rotatable & Removable Front Cover\u3011The head of the small fan is able to rotate 360 degrees to meet your needs on different occasions. The front cover is removable. Twist the front cover counterclockwise with your thumbs of both hands and take it down when you feel the need to clean the fan.",
            "\ud83c\udf81\u30104 Rubber feet\u3011The electric fan has 4 rubber feet on the bottom of the pedestal to reduce vibration and increase friction, which makes the fan stable and not move or flip over even on a smooth surface."

Roughly same weigh as a USB mouse (for computer)MUCH SAFER: The fan is USB, approx. 5 volts, not the usual electric plug-in 110 volts line voltage. This is a huge deal for me with a young child, and often moving around water. 100v scares me. 5v couldn't hurt a fly!QUIET. Not totally silent, but much less than the sound of larger, 110v fan.Since it's USB, you could run it on a USB battery, or even USB solar panel.My use:For a trip to the hot Caribbean in Aug, I bought a few of these to supplement the weak AC in the hotel.Instead of buying a more expensive, bigger, heavier 110v fan, I got a few of these at around same cost.They worked great! I will continue to use at home, on the go, or travel.I hope this review helps you - Stay Cool!",

                "reviewText": "I sleep next to a metal 18\" Patton high-velocity fan that sells for $85, is meant for use in garages and workshops, and provides excellent airflow and white noise. I love it (and good sleep) so much that I bring it with me when I travel by car, and when I can't bring it, I typically ship a $20ish 20\" Lasko box fan from Walmart wherever I'm staying (because even a few days of good sleep is worth $20ish). I couldn't bring or ship either to Italy, though, and I knew that my fan sounds app alone wouldn't cut it. So, I bought this thinking that even a dinky fan would be better than nothing, and it's surprisingly AMAZING!It's incredibly lightweight, which is perfect since I'm an overpacker, and its high-speed setting actually moves a surprising amount of air, providing some real cooling and a nice little fan sound that complimented my fan sounds app perfectly, better approximated my usual setup, and helped me get great sleep while away for two weeks. In addition, its USB connector can plug into any wall charger or European outlet converter, which was super convenient. If this ever dies, I'll buy another immediately. But it seems pretty sturdy for such a lightweight fan. I'm incredibly impressed, and my fan standards are incredibly high if that wasn't already apparent.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this little fan as a travel fan. We cruise a lot and I need air circulation to help me sleep. This fan is so powerful and has three settings. The lowest setting is enough but the second setting is better. The high setting will actually cool a small room! I love this little fan so much that I purchased a second one for my husband to use on his side of the bed. I like it to blow directly in my face. Light weight and will easily hang on the wall of the cruise cabin using small magnets ( walls on cruise ships are metal).",

                "reviewText": "I use it to occasionally blow air away from cabinet mounted computer that does CPU intensive renderings.The office is smallish so sound volume is crucial.At the lowest / slowest setting it is quiet enough not to be disruptive and provides adequate air flow.At the medium, and especially high setting, it may be too loud for workspaces where people need to work.USB power cable is on the thin side but sufficiently long. Outside plastic chassis is sturdy enough.Overall, I would buy it again.",

It is so powerful for how small it is, and I have been using it every night for 6 months now with no problems. I honestly expected it to break by now given how much I use it and how inexpensive it is, but it is still going strong. It kept me cool during the summer in a dorm room with no AC and I continue to use it in the winter for the airflow and subtle white noise. Best purchase ever.",
