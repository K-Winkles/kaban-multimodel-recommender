I was working as hospice case manager and going into some of these long-term care facilities I was sweating buckets. I wanted something that would cool me down, but not freeze my patients. It worked for about a month and then it stopped charging. When it stopped charging, it stopped turning on, and the only thing that cooled me down was the metal piece in the back of the contraption. Eventually I just tossed it because it was no longer working. It worked for a little bit and I\u2019ll definitely give it a couple stars because it did work in the beginning, but really sad it stopped.",

I bought this hoping it would help alleviate that a little bit but it was very underwhelming. If its hot you'll just have hot air blowing in your face and only when you are in an air conditioned area is it good. It's not adjustable so you can't bend it to your liking and if it's quiet the fans sounds are quite noticeable. My coworkers thought they were cool though.",
