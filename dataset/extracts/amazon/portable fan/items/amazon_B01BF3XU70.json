First, although the fan is billed as having two speeds, the slow speed is so slow that it might be used only for blowing out candles on a birthday cake. Maybe. Second, the \u201cfoot\u201d on which the fan rests has a very limited range making it difficult to direct the air. But overall the fan - oops, the \u201cair circulator\u201d as Vornado calls the device - is a good small fan (sorry Vornado!).",

The third time I used it, the other side broke. Without them, it\u2019s unusable. I\u2019ll repeat, this is not a one off, this is a design flaw with cheap material.I reached out to the company to see if they would make it right or at least explain why this happens.

I am using a Vernado 1303 at home and I have taken it on the road with me but I\u2019d prefer to leave it at home for my wife. I came across this Vernado travel fan and I will say, the build quality and look is awesome. The typical noise you hear from a fan is great for the size of it and it pushes plenty of air.Now\u2026WHAT THE H*LL IS THAT NOISE??There is a deep rumbling/vibration type sound coming from this fan that I cannot seem to isolate. Even if I hold it in my hand I can hear this sound and it\u2019s not constant. It\u2019s really hard to describe but I can tell you this, it\u2019s keeping me awake and I cannot even use this fan. I know it sounds petty but my other Vernado does not have this issue. If it was more of a constant noise I could deal with it but it fluctuates and that is disturbing to sleep. I\u2019m very disappointed as I really wanted to like this van.",

This fan is not extremely powerful, but is the perfect travel companion for drowning out your partners snoring or to provide a respite from the heat. The fan fits perfectly on a hotel nightstand and has a long enough cord to plug into the wall outlet. I am very pleased with the quality and would definitely recommend.",
