I've brought it with me on a train, in the hospital, at a hotel, air bnb, family member houses and I can attach it practically anywhere! Just make sure you remember that the highest speed makes the battery drain faster, so it will need plugged in sooner! So, my only thing is wish it had a bigger battery, lol, but it still lasts hours, and you can use it while it's plugged in also, and it takes the same charger as my phone, a type c, so I just switch my phone back and forth with this fan!! I just love it!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Pros: 1. Portability and Versatility Unleashed: The Stroller Fan embodies the epitome of portability. Its ingenious flexible tripod design endows it with the ability to be affixed to a myriad of surfaces, rendering it a superlative choice for cribs, offices, treadmills, bicycles, car seats, camping expeditions, and even desktops. 2. Flexible Tripod Masterpiece: The artistry of the flexible tripod is a revelation. It can artfully encircle stroller handles, crib rails, or any suitable structure, delivering a 360-degree flourish of coolness in any desired direction. 3. Hushed Whirring: This fan conducts its operations with an almost ethereal silence, ensuring that tranquility is preserved, making it the quintessential choice for a serene nursery or a hushed office environment. 4.

Myriad Speed Settings: The Stroller Fan allows for an assortment of speed settings, permitting the user to modulate the airflow to their exacting specifications.Cons: 1. Limited Battery Life: While the rechargeable battery is a convenience, some might find it wanting in the longevity department, particularly when the fan is set to higher speeds. 2. Compact Dimensions: The fan\u2019s petite stature, a double-edged sword of sorts, offers exceptional portability, yet it may not match the cooling potency of more substantial fans. 3. Clip Endurance: Reports have surfaced regarding the clip\u2019s vulnerability, particularly when subjected to sweltering conditions or the rigors of outdoor usage.Conclusion:The Stroller Fan is an exemplar of versatility, portability, and convenience, offering a quintessential solution for staying comfortable while on the move. Its innovative flexible tripod design and whisper-quiet operation make it the ideal choice for discerning parents, professionals seeking solace in tranquil offices, and fitness aficionados in pursuit of a treadmill companion. While it may exhibit some limitations in terms of battery life and clip durability, its myriad virtues unequivocally overshadow these drawbacks, rendering it an indispensable addition to your summer accoutrements. Stay effortlessly cool and content wherever your journey takes you with the Stroller Fan.",

The legs are sturdy and bend at different angles to grip onto the COW. As for the battery life, it depends on how much you use and the power level. The nice thing about having the USB plug is I don\u2019t have to worry about it dying on me while it\u2019s plugged in during high activity.My coworkers also said the fan is useful on baby strollers.
