                "reviewText": "This fan is freakin' amazing! I've bought one for myself and two as gifts for others. The amount of wind power that this little thing manages to produce is a wonder. It's comparable to a traditional desk fan, not a portable fan--and better even than many of those!It folds up small enough to take with you when traveling. (Assuming you're checking luggage and portable cooling is important to you. I mean, it's not pocket sized.) I love that you can adjust the height and angle, so I can have it tilted towards me when I'm applying makeup in a muggy climate.I was pleasantly surprised how long the battery lasted and how quick it was to charge. (Though I do wish there was some indicator of battery life.) I didn't expect it to last long for the amount of oomph it has, but I had no problems. Also, you can run it while plugged in if you're gonna need it for awhile.As others have said, there's a cable but no wall adapter included. It uses a USB-A to micro-USB connector, so most likely any charger you have on hand with a standard USB port will work.The only down side is that it doesn't really function as a floor lamp as advertised, at least where I tried it on carpet. It immediatly tipped over.Seriously though, I love this fan.",

                "reviewText": "So this fan is great minus the battery. I\u2019ve owned it less than a year and it won\u2019t hold a charge. I never travel with it so this wouldn\u2019t normally be a problem except for the fact that it will shut off without a good battery. The issue is either due to crap batteries or a poor implementation of the ip5306. I suspect the latter.If you have the same issue, and you probably will, there is a white sticker on the bottom that looks like the plastic. It\u2019s hiding four screws that will let you disassemble the fan (see pics). You can replace the battery with another 3.7v or move the 5v usb connector to where the battery was plugged in. This worked just fine without dropping the voltage.Edit: The higher voltage did cause some issues. I just didn\u2019t notice right away. Use something like an LM2596 to drop the voltage to 3.7 and you\u2019ll be fine. There are tons of them on Amazon.",

I\u2019m sure I could find the info online. The best best part is I can move it from room to room, put it where I need it and not plug it in.Even though it\u2019s not a big fan it puts out a nice breeze even on low. I\u2019m in a 2 bed apartment so it\u2019s not like I need it to blow across a large living room. The ability to raise and lower it works too. The pole isn\u2019t the heaviest I\u2019ve soon but it works and that\u2019s what I care about. Also realized today that it will fit neatly back into the compact box for stowing in the closet every Fall.",
