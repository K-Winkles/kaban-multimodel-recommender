                "reviewText": "This little fan was a blessing during the 2 week hot spell we had here in the mid-west. It puts out quite a bit of air for it's size and I wore it from around my neck to blow directly into my face. On the really hot days it was just blowing hot air at you but that is not the fault of the fan, and any air movement is welcomed, hot or not. The only down side to this fan is the lower than advertised battery life. 5-15 hours is what it claims. 3 hours is what I was getting on the highest setting. Any of the lower settings just didn't push enough air to my face and head while wearing it so I stuck with the highest setting resulting in lower battery life. This just meant it was always charging when not in use so it was ready for my next maintenance call out on the hot production floor. All said, I give this fan 2 thumbs ups and recommended it to everyone who inquired about it while I was using it.",

                "reviewText": "I took the opportunity to order three of these waist clip type fans to compare features and functionality. But my major observation, and hence the 3 Star rating, is that they are too heavy for someone wearing running shorts, yoga pants or other spandex-type garments. Hanging it around your neck while doing kitchen prep might seem like a good idea, but lean forward and it ends up in the batter (or whatever you are preparing). Also, do you really need a fan while you're riding a bicycle at 15 miles per hour, creating your own wind?The problem with sticking a fan on your waistband and possibly under your shirt is that the shirt is going to get sucked into the fan. This Civpower Portable Waist Clip Fan (the black one) provides a small clip area just above the fan intake port to keep this from happening. The problem I see is that the shirt can flip over the clip or just come out of the clip completely. You don't want to be dealing with this during your exercise session. Also, I gave it a try while a friend critiqued the styling - Said it looked stupid (her word, not mine). The fan has 3 speeds and can charge your phone in an emergency (as long as you remembered to bring a charge cord along on your run, walk or bike ride). It also has a hard off/on switch that is helpful so that pressing the speed selector button when not in use doesn't accidentally turn the fan on. The waist clip is long, but not that tight - it relies on the length to keep it in position. Overall a decent unit except that it is the most expensive of the three at over 40 bucks (at the time of this writing).",

Especially when the summer heat really starts warming up and two a days get going. This thing helps keep those back beads of sweat from rolling so frequently.
