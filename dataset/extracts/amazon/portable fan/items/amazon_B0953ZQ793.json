                "reviewText": "I wasn't sure what to expect with this. When I opened it and saw how small it was (See my old fan behind it for comparison) I thought it was going to be a joke.I was very wrong. It's powerful, the speed settings are great and you get great airflow no matter what speed you use, the little remote not only works for the fan but also mysteriously works for the space heater that I've had for years (as seen in the pic) as well, which is incredibly awesome. So now I have a remote controlled space heater somehow.It can also be converted to a table fan and, because of the compact size, can be taken with me easily if I ever wanted to take it anywhere, could easily fit in my luggage.It's very quiet too, which is actually a con for me because I enjoy the white noise of fans but could definitely be a plus for people that like a quiet fan or if you are staying with someone and want the airflow without the noise.Has multiple speeds, all with great air flow, the fan head is adjustable so you can angle it, and it's a USB cord charger (does not come with the plug in adapter part so you will need to have that to plug into the wall or surge protector, but if you don't have that just plug it into your comp or USB charge port and you're good to go). Also still runs while it's charging. I can't speak to how long it runs unplugged because I always have it plugged in.I would highly recommend for it's compactability, fan power, general cuteness, and magic remote that works on other devices somehow. Definitely more than worth it for the price.",

                "reviewText": "My first purchase of the fan did not work. I tried everything: extra charging, trouble shooting, reading the manual. The reason I wanted this fan was because it is foldable, adjustable and easy to detach and clean. The remote is a plus. Fortunately, the company replaced my fan within 24hours. I plugged the new fan in and it worked perfectly. I'm in love with the soft pink color and the charging cord is not different from a plug-in fan. However, I am able to unplug a move about my space. Love it.",

                "reviewText": "OMG this is the best personal fan I've ever seen! I do HIIT routines 3 times a day every day, so I always need to have a floor fan next to me. I gave my old one to a college kid so bought this one as replacement. This is such a wonderful fan!1) It's telescopic so it can be used as a desk fan as well as a floor one! 2) The build quality is pretty good, and the price is just great! 3) It's quite stylish. 4) It comes in a totally frustration-free box, very well packaged and easy to take out and super-easy to set up -- no tools needed at all! 5) Three fan speeds, and not noisy even at the highest speed. 6) One \"natural wind\" mode (\"4th speed\") that mimics natural on-and-off rhythm. 7) Cute remote for power, timer and speed/mode; remote can be put away in the base. 8) Can be folded away (the way it came out of the box). 9) Front grille can be easily removed to increase wind power further. 10) Built-in 7500 mAH LiIon battery, so it can be used without plugging in and can charge an iPhone!I'm going to buy two more for my study and bedroom. This is totally awesome!",

It\u2019s quiet in my opinion.Cons: I wish it had some more \u2018power\u2019. You need it on the highest setting which kills the battery a lot sooner, (expect 2 hrs tops) and even then the highest setting still feels a bit weak. That\u2019s really the only negative, otherwise it fits my needs.",
