There are just a few buttons on the front that you need to use to adjust the speed and oscillation.Overall, I am very happy with the Tredy Air Circulator Fan. It is a small, quiet, and energy-efficient fan that is perfect for use in small spaces. I would definitely recommend it to others.Here are some of the pros and cons of the Tredy Air Circulator Fan:**Pros:*** Small and compact* Quiet* Energy-efficient* Three speeds* Oscillates* Easy to use**Cons:*** Not very powerful* Not ideal for large spaces* Can be a bit wobblyOverall, I think the Tredy Air Circulator Fan is a great option for people who are looking for a small, quiet, and energy-efficient fan for use in small spaces.
