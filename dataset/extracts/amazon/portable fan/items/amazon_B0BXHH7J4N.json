                "reviewText": "I bought this fan to take to work. My workplace lost the main a/c unit and can not get another one until fall. I had another battery operated fan, but the battery would die long before the end of my shift, so I was excited to find this fan with 20,000mah battery. The fan itself is smaller than 9\", but does throw a lot of air for the size. It is sturdy enough to set on a small table without being unstable, even when oscillating (which was a problem with my other fan). The battery will last all day (8+ hours) on the highest setting. It does, however, take a long time to fully charge, even with a fast charge cable. I have received many compliments about this fan from my coworkers. Because it is battery powered, I can place it anywhere I need to and not be limited by where the nearest power outlet is located. If necessary, I can take a battery bank and plug it into the back of the unit to give it a boost. It has been a literal lifesaver this summer when temperatures have been over 90\u00b0+. Excess temps don't seem to wear the battery down sooner than expected either, although I am unsure of how well it will last over time.Edit: I have now used this fan for 9 months, and it's still going strong. Still lasts through an 8 hour shift, still getting compliments from co-workers. Worth every penny.",

This fan ticks all of the buttons. HUGE battery, able to charge my electronics while reading outside from the fan. It oscillates or not, 4 levels of speed, 3 light levels, can set for up to 8 hours. Lovely remote that sits in a groove on the fan body. My neighbor saw it and liked the features. Problem solved on his Christmas gift. Gave it to him early when it arrived in perfect condition yesterday evening. He charged it and loves it! Thank you for a quality product and fast shipping.",

                "reviewText": "Ok, so this fan is marketed as a 9 inch fan. The fan housing is about 7 inches only, the fan blades are about 5 inches in diameter. The only thing that equals 9 inches is the total width of the fan unit including the side supports. So far, this the only downside I have noticed. I have not actually used it much yet except briefly after unboxing. The led light is pretty bright, the breeze on level 4 feels pretty good for its size. I'm curious how the battery will hold up, I may edit my review after I use it awhile. One neat feature is you can set this fan to oscillate at either 90 degrees or at 45 degrees. That being said, overall I feel that this fan is a good buy so far.",

                "reviewText": "I got really sick and ended up in the hospital a couple of months ago due to the heat. So we invested in2 of these 20000 amp fans in orange. At the time they were $42.99. We thought it would be worth the investment b\\c of how sick I got from dehydration despite the things I did to combat it. I have waited to write a review until I used them for a while to make sure I could write a review based on more than one use. These fans have been amazing! We ended up getting a 3rd one as well. They last all weekend at my market events and I have recommended them to several people b\\c they thought they were so good! They do take about 12 hours to charge when on about 25% so we charge them overnight when they need it. That was the one negative I read about these but honestly itye fan lasts for like 12-15 hours and I run them on high speed, use the light and often the charging port in the back and they STILL last! These are great and I highly recommend them! I am finally able to do my markets without getting sick! Most of them are outside and we need to stay cool and light things up for evening markets. The charging time doesn't bother me at all b\\c they battery lasts so long. I've never written such a long review but I really do back this product and wanted to do it justice!",

Hang it up from the top of the golf cart at the beach, nice fan riding around the campground. Has a very bright light and lasts a long time. I'm very pleased with it and glad I bought it. Would highly recommend and would buy another if I needed to or for someone for a gift. No regrets! Would be great in a tent I would think, I also keep it on my nightstand, on low it's a nice lil breeze at night.",
