                "reviewText": "There are so many awesome things about this fan it's hard to know where to start! It is light weight and travel size so it is easy to pack or carry with you anywhere plus it is cord and battery free so you just charge it up with a regular usb and your good to go for hours! There are even lights to signal how much battery life you have left so that you know when you need to recharge it. The flexible tripod gives the ability to use the fan literally anywhere, it doesn't have to be on a flat surface or table like other fans do although it can do that as well. You can even hang it upside down or angle it so that it's blowing right on you or right in the direction you want it to blow because the fan itself also spins 360\u00b0 around. I was pleasantly surprised at how well the fan worked at cooling me down considering it's size! It has three fan speeds that all work great and it is considerably quiet. The highest speed has a little noise but it is barely noticable. An added bonus is that the fan has an LED light that has three levels of brightness. I have never seen a fan with a light before but it is very versatile. There's also a timer with three options if you want it to turn off on its own after a certain time. Overall I am really happy with this product it just covers so many bases and so many needs all in one package. I like to tie it up on my little table with my laptop so that while I do school work I have a breeze and a light (like the photos), or when I go on walks with my baby in the stroller and it's really hot I can hook it right on the stroller to keep my baby and myself cool. I would definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Loved the size, multiple uses (with flexible \"tripod\" legs)- & the 3 level LED light & the timer are such a bonus feature. I had to order a 2nd, after I saw how impressed my husband was with my initial order.It is made well, not too bulky and it does take 7-8 hrs. for a full charge- but have only used it on low & med. daily & have not had to recharge yet. You're able to monitor the charge level ...a blue light will display at 4 % levels (25,50,75 & 100%). Anyone considering, will be a satisfied customer. Great Amazon product!!!",

                "reviewText": "This fan is wonderful and I finally found a solution to our nightly feud!!! I have night sweats and hot flashes and by hubby does his best to understand but he HATES having a fan blow across his face. But one fan on my nightstand wasn\u2019t enough, you get it ladies, right? We would start with a fan on his bed stand blowing on me and as soon as I would fall asleep he would turn it, so when the first hot flash started, the first argument started and so ensued the nightly dance. You\u2019d think they would understand more??? LOL! We looked for clip on fans but our upholstered headboard is too thick, I bought a neck fan, but that\u2019s a pain in the middle of the night so the fight continued. I have three fans by my side and the air way down. Then my hubs found this! When he got it in he maneuvered it on our head board directly over my head! It has three speeds and swivels and tilts to adjust to whatever position I am sleeping in. We keep it plugged in so we never have to use the battery and it\u2019s co compact it travels perfectly! It\u2019s just enough noise for me, a small peaceful hummm. It also has a light so I can read by it with fan off it he wants to sleep and I\u2019m still awake (me a pause again)! It\u2019s perfect! I also use during the day reading. I recently had surgery and the fan was again a life saver as I was bedridden for a week! I can\u2019t say enough about this. I have gotten to where I just keep it on at night. The ONLY negative I can say is the little green power light when on. I did have to put some electricians tape over front of fan in small area to keep light out of my eyes at night when I\u2019m sleeping but it didn\u2019t affect the fan at all. I would recommend this fan 100% I\u2019m sure you could use it about anywhere!",
