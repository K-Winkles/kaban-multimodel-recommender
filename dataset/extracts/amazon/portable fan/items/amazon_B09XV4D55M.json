                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Review after owning a few days. I like it.",
                "reviewText": "Edit: I forgot to mention that the power cord is short on this fan. It measures about 5ft but I think 7ft or 8ft would have been more appropriate. I have ordered a 3ft black single outlet extension cord to give it a more seamless look with the original power cord and more length to allow me to move the fan around.From a noise sensitive person: this is a quiet fan, even on the highest setting. It is exactly what I was hoping it to be. It's audible but it's a low-pitch, whirring sound produced by the blades moving air. It doesn't have a lot of vibration and has no clicking sounds on oscillation. If you want a significant amount of background noise to drown out other sounds, this might not be the fan for you. Comparing it to a couple of smaller portable usb fans that I have, this Pelonis fan is like a chill, relaxed dude - quieter and has a more pleasing sound whereas the other fans have kind of a metallic-y high-pitched crazy-business sound.This fan is not going to blow you away on the highest setting, but it's perfect for me because most of the time I actually find that annoying. It moves a good amount of air around; it's just not a turbo air blaster. If you live in a warmer climate than I do, you might need more. Right now it is hotter than usual summer temps in the high 90 -100 F and this fan is perfect for my already fairly cool basement apartment.You will likely have to assemble the fan yourself like others have mentioned in the reviews, unless that changes for some reason. It was fairly easy to follow the instructions and no tools were needed. Having to put it together yourself is kind of a drawback, but at least I know how the fan went together now and I can take it apart easily if I want to. It looks like it should be simple to clean with the front grill assembly just snapping apart at the bottom.While doing my comparison shopping, the retro metal table top fans looked prettier to me and I was willing to pay more money for that and for high quality hardware but after reading a ton of reviews, there were enough speaking to noise issues that I decided on this one instead. This fan is made of plastic but it has a clean and basic design that I like enough. I was surprised when putting the fan together that the base is mostly hollow/concave without a flat bottom all across. It does make it lighter in weight and I guess easier to move around, probably less expensive to make from a manufacturing perspective but I think a heavier base would make it more sturdy. However, it's not really flimsy and I don't think its going to fall over unless it gets knocked over.The other thing that I didn't prefer is that the fan was shipped in the product box with a picture and description of what it is for everyone to see. There should at least be an option for discreet packaging. Even though it's only a fan, I don't need people knowing what I ordered and there isn't really much packaging to prevent the fan from being damaged in transit.This is a review from someone who has only owned the fan for a few days so I cannot speak to the longevity and durability of it. Overall a good fan for the price ($30) and I am about to purchase another one so I can have one in each room.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this fan for several months now and I've used it nightly to sleep but tend to leave it running 24/7 at times as I forget I have it running (its pretty quiet). It has been solid with zero issues nor mechanical noise. There is a very soft woosh sound of the blades pushing through the air but I don't hear it from my bed as I have the fan placed about 4 feet away. It has variable speed and oscillates well. I HATE dust so my favorite feature is that I can easily disassemble the fan unit to clean off all the dust that may build up on the blades. I specifically looked for majority plastic assembly as rinsing the blades off in water makes it a snap to clean (obviously don't put the main base that houses the motor and controls in water). The back cage is metal but its easy to wipe that clean with a very damp cloth. The only downside is if you are going to remove the blades for cleaning, putting the front grill back on can be a bit tricky at times but you'll get used to it. I'm actually writing this review as I order a second unit for my home office. Fingers crossed this next one is as good as this current one.",

                "reviewText": "Needed a desk fan that tilted down a bit. Very hard to fine. Some of the relatively inexpensive fans did so (e.g., my previous Amazon Basics that gave up the ghost), but reviews were not overwhelmingly positive. Oddly, the pricier ones did not tilt downward. So the search continued. Finally found this Pelonis. Reviews indicated it was worth a chance. They were right. It's quiet. Reasonably easy to assemble - no tools required. Puts out a lot of air - more than expected on LOW. Definitely recommended. It does take up a bit of space, considerably more than a micro-tower fan. But moves the air. Quietly. Comfortably.",

I have a large, older Pelonis floor fan and now two Pelonis table top fans.The table top fan oscillates in a wide arc, and the air is blown powerfully. I ordered this fan because of the Texas heat wave here in Houston (summer 2023); two of my other tabletop fans produced by a different company are barely able to make a difference.My Pelonis floor fan and two Pelonis table top fans are great, however. My dog, by the way, loves to sit in front of the Pelonis floor fan.My only complaint is that I did have a hard time snapping the front grill onto the back grill of one of the two fans (as instructed in the enclosed directions). Eventually, I was successful, but it was quite a wrestling match, and I almost gave up.One of the Pelonis table top fans is running nearby as I watch TV. The fan is quiet and does not affect my ability to hear and enjoy the programming on the TV.",
