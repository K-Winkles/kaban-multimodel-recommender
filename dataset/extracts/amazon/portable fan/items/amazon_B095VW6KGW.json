                "reviewText": "It does a great job sitting on my desk and keeping me cool throughout the day. It's a little bit noisy, but it's a fan so of course it makes noise. I love the three levels, the light, and that fact that it doesn't have blades (the blades broke on my last desk fan and I was very sad when that happened). It will even blow cool air all the way across a small room on the highest setting, which I did not expect. I would definitely buy it again.",

There is minimal noise and resembles a Dyson, but much more affordable. It helps to circulate the air and puts out a gentle breeze. Great for small spaces. I use mine at work.",

My son likes the high speed as he says it gets him cold. He also enjoys the light colors. I needed something quiet and portable. They are great size and good price. Very durable.",

It\u2019s cute and light weight but it didn\u2019t wow me. :(",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this fan to replace an older fan I use in the bathroom. This fan looked like it produced good airflow on the videos so I figured I would try it. It was so disappointing. There is a little tiny fan in the base that pulls the air in and then that air blows out of the tube holes up top to produce the \u201cbladeless airflow\u201d. Even on the highest setting it blows very little. I would compare it to the low setting on a hairdryer and that\u2019s being generous. I guess I just expected more from the videos that were advertised for it.",

                "reviewText": "I work from home most days and it has been really hot lately! My small apartment does not have AC sadly, and due to space as well as being on the phone throughout the day, my tower fan is too loud and bulky! I bought this little fan to sit it on my desk and to be quiet while I work. So far, it does what you\u2019d expect! A light tap on the button turns it on, it has 3 different can settings, and a few different but fun colored light options. I can\u2019t complain with this purchase. If you are interested in trying one out for yourself, be aware that this fan is not silent though! It still has a light hum on the lowest setting. I think it\u2019s actually fairly calming. But I called my sister on my work phone to test if she could hear it.. And though not intensely, she definitely could hear it as background noise!Additionally, this fan is not built to cool down an entire room. Sure, it may work for people in small rooms or who like to have a light fan on at bed.. But if this product wasn\u2019t on my desk where I am, I probably wouldn\u2019t feel it too much. Still though! It\u2019s a good little fan, and will get the job I need done. :)",
