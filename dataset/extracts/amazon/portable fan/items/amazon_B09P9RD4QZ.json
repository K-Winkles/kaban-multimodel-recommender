                "reviewText": "Updating to include this: Battery life is amazing, and fan is pretty powerful! I've been using it on low for 3 days and it hasn't died yet. I haven't really needed to use the higher wind settings except here and there because it's pretty powerful - but on the lowest setting it's basically silent. Love it.This thing is so cool. It oscillates by rotating from underneath the base so the whole thing swings back and forth which...if my cats stop being afraid and start trying to ride I will record and update this review with video \ud83d\udc80I get crazy, severely hot due to some medical conditions/medications and need a fan everywhere all the time. This is going to be very easy to travel with but I'm planning to buy another for my art studio! It turns really far to each side and really powerful on high so if you put it in the corner of a room could reasonably cool a whole room.The height is PERFECT fully extended for our couch height. In the studio I'll be able to put it up on a table or on the ground or oscillating across a wider painting or a bunch of smaller ones all at the same time - I feel like the possibilities are endless!Other stuff: The remote is handy since repeatedly getting up and down to turn on/off a fan makes me hot AF in itself. The support pole locks in place so it doesn't collapse when extended, it's easy to fold, charges pretty fast and is really a steal for the price.My ONLY criticism is so minor its varely worth mentioning, but nonetheless: I might worry about losing the remlte wile traveling because theres no place to attach it, might consoder a magnetic mount on the next version - though its also simple enough that i already have the stuff to do it myself and plan to so its not really a problem for me. I can't imagine any of the $80+ fans that look identical to this one being worth more than double the price of this one. In conclusion: This Fan Rules",

My home office tends to get hotter than the rest of the house.- I wanted a fan that was quiet enough for video calls. The fan is very quiet. Cannot be heard on video calls.-The remote control feature is really nice too, so I can just stay at my desk and turn it on. Nobody knows I\u2019m turning a fan on during a video call!- I wanted a fan the was small, portable, and convenient, so I could get great use out of it. I take it to the kitchen to helpCirculate air while I cook. I take it outside on the patio and it helps keep mosquitos away! The wireless feature is great!! I love that I can take it anywhere!- The fan is still really powerful! It\u2019s strong enough that I never want more. The oscillating works great too!!",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for an upcoming 2 week cruise. If you know - you know about how they do their AC systems.I love how it is compact. Very easy to extend. You can extend it up pretty high or leave it as a table fan. It oscillates which is nice. The fan I brought on our last cruise was stationary and I didn't like that.The battery lasted a LONG time. I left it running because I wanted to drain the battery, it went on for a couple days and it was not even fully charged. Awesome. I also like the different speeds you can choose. I don't always need a fan blasting on high speed. Very quiet too. I'd forget it was there and on.The only downside that I have so far is that it will take up a good piece of your luggage. The sizes they provide are accurate but I didn't associate that in my mind. It just shocked me. It also weighs a bit so i may have to not pack as many shoes. Lol overall, u would definitely buy it again.If anything changes after our trip in May, I will re-evaluate. But for now - it's great!",

And it's so quiet you forget it's on. The only bad thing I've found is when fully extended it falls forward if you touch it the least bit. But I put a piece of cardboard where it folds to stop that. But everything else is so good it makes up for that many times over. I'd buy another one in a heartbeat. Great Fan.",

                "reviewText": "So far I am very happy with this portable rechargeable fan. I never even knew there were rechargeable fans like this until recently. This is a great item to own for many different scenarios where you can't plug in a normal fan and/or need more portability. Fan has all the expected features like rotation/swivel, angle adjust, different strengths, and even a sleep timer. Really like that it uses USB-C for the recharge port too, as that is the most common type of charging cable at this point. Included remote is handy too so you don't always have to bend over to change settings. Fan has an extremely small footprint when fully folded up and can be stored anywhere. No separate pieces, everything is all-in-one/connected and very portable. At full height, fan becomes decently tall for most situations. Also nice that the battery should last up to 8 hours before needing another recharge. All of this for a very decent price. Very happy with the fan so far and looking forward to using it more.",

                "reviewText": "This was somewhat of a surprise in a good way! Seeing as the fan is only 10\u2019 I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be so powerful and yet portable at the same time. The fan charges relatively fast so that you are only your way to create great air circulation anywhere, without the need to for a power source. The extension pool allows for multiple height adjustments as well as you can tip the angle, allow you to place this on a table or on the floor for the same functionality. The included remote means you can sit back and just enjoy the breeze. The fan can also oscillate to cover a great area! The multiple speeds and sleep timer are great features as well and all can be accessed from the include remote control. If you are looking for a portable and functional fan I can\u2019t recommend this enough!",
