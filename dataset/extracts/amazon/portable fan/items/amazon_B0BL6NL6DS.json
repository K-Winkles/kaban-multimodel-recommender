                "reviewText": "As a Florida resident, I am no stranger to the sweltering summer heat and the near-unbearable humidity that comes with it. While I tend to stay indoors to escape the sun's relentless rays, there are times when I must venture out. On those occasions, the KIDEE neck fan has become my go-to gadget for staying cool and comfortable.Despite being a bit on the noisy side, which is noticeable but not a dealbreaker, and feeling somewhat uncomfortable against my skin after prolonged use, I've found the benefits far outweigh these minor inconveniences. A cushioned material would be a welcome upgrade for future models, and I can't help but dream about the bliss of a misting feature to further alleviate the heat. Nevertheless, the KIDEE neck fan delivers admirably on its promise to keep you cool.The fan's long battery life ensures that I can rely on it throughout my outdoor adventures without constant recharging. The material, albeit hard, is flexible enough to adjust for a better fit around my neck. The powerful fan offers a refreshing breeze that is much needed in the Florida climate, and the quality construction gives me confidence that this device will be a lasting companion.For anyone planning a trip to Disney World or preparing to spend any time outdoors in Florida, I highly recommend the KIDEE neck fan. It's a simple solution to a complex problem - beating the heat. It has quickly become an indispensable part of my summer survival kit, and I'm sure it will be just as valuable to others living in or visiting hot climates.In summary, the KIDEE neck fan is a solid investment for those seeking relief from the heat. It's a functional, well-constructed device that does exactly what it's made to do - keep you cool and make the Florida heat a little more bearable.",

I had the neck fan off and on (but mostly on and on high) for over 12 hours during a long travel day, and it never ran out of power. The only recommendation I would have is for the manufacturer to add a lock switch, so if you want to put it in your bag you don't have to worry about hitting the power button and running the battery down without realizing it. This thing is quiet. Big plus I have long layered curly hair which did get in the fan a couple times but it just made funny noise, and did not eat my hair or get tangled in the neck fan.",

Brought it on a family trip to an amusement park and shared it almost all day. We must have used if for 3 or 4 hours and it was still working. Takes time to fully charge though. If you have along day ahead just charge it overnight. Great battery life.Looks great, everyone thinks it is a headset. Love the 360 fans, it is not as flexible as the others because of this but I appreciate the breeze on the back of my neck where usually we sweat most. It is not too heavy, you feel it at first but then forget it is there. Once you take it off or turn it off you really notice a difference, it cools you down. I like that it is white because it won't absorb heat and get hot. Other colors like black will only get warm under the sun so white is the way to go. Looks stylish so you don't look odd wearing it. Perfect if you have hot flashes or fell flush.I never thought it would be as useful as it is. Who knew? I like it a lot!",
