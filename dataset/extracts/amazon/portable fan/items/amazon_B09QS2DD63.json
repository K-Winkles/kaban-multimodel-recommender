On battery I am using it at 50% of speed is the weather is not too hot and even is like 5 feets away the air is strong enough. At that speed lasts more than 7 hours, not sure how much at 100%. I use the light, is a useful thing... it has make my time better after a power outage at night. I can stay fresh and use that light, and even charge a phone if I need to. The charging port is type C, if you have a battery backup you can prolong the Fan usage even more easily if the power outage takes to long to resolve. Is a light weight, for sure a nice thing for someone that makes camping and carries to much things, this one is light.",

                "reviewText": "This fan is great! It is quiet, works well. You can actually feel the air, and I like that it has 4 settings. It is stable on the base, holds positions well. The hook to hang it by was a smart bonus. Easy to charge and holds a charge well . Took it camping- it was so miserably hot at night and this was perfect and quiet. The light on it is also nice with 3 different settings.Haven\u2019t had it for very long, but it has held up to lots of kid handling and walking. I\u2019m so happy with this purchase!",

The 4 speeds is a nice touch, although the higher the speed, the louder the fan, which I would expect anyway. There is an internal light that glows through the housing and it's pretty bright. Not great for me, so I just cover it in self adhesive felt and that worked perfectly. Overall, I would definitely buy this again. What a lifesaver!",
