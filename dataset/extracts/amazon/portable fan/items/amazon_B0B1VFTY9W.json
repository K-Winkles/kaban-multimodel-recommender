I can't sleep without noise so when I'm traveling I set this up next to my bed, it does have an auto shut off after 4(I think?) Hours. The battery lasts so long! I'm able to use it for an entire day at Disney at level 3 and it only gets down to about 70%, I purchased the more powerful battery model!One thing I will say is that when you're outside in the heat, it will blow hot air at you, and when you're inside you'll get cold air. Still, hot air is better than no air! Also, you have to hold it most of the time. When it's hanging on your neck it bounces around too much.",

It works extremely well. It has five blades and the cover so I think that helps. I work in a warehouse and needed something to be able to cool down. It also can be worn as a necklace. Yes a little clunky but if your not bending up and down alot you will be fine. The battery \ud83d\udd0b is great! Long hours. It also has a digital battery percentage reader so you will always know if it needs to be charged. It can be folded and it has a little extra stand. Its cute. I recommend for trips or work. And one last thing it comes with little discs so you can put your favorite essential oil on it. Necklace is a cool addition",

                "reviewText": "I purchased a personal fan that was marketed as portable and rechargeable, but unfortunately, it turned out to be a total waste of money. After just one day, the fan completely stopped charging, leaving me in frustration and wishing I had spent my money elsewhere.The fan had no obvious physical damages, but charging seemed to be the biggest issue. I tried using different cables and chargers, but still, the fan wouldn't revive.It's a shame since I genuinely needed a personal fan, and this particular one had high ratings.",

The stand sat on the rolling table and I was able to direct the airflow easily. The charge held for a really long time! I really liked being able to have it stationary or handheld. The only thing I would have liked would be a little bit larger of a base as it was a bit too heavy",
