It can also charge your phone, which is a plus for me! It can also bend so it can work on its own. Overall definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I have 0 complaints about this fan. Its PERFECT! I wanted something light weight that I could use around campus, and it has been a life saver in this Texas heat! I love that it comes with a neck/ hanging strap so it can be hands free. It also bends at the neck area so it can easily be used on a desk or table. There are 6 fan settings, and even the first/ lowest setting is enough for me on most days! It's little but it packs a punch. I love the screen area that tells the battery percentage of the fan- it is way easier to understand than the typical blinking lights or etc of other mini fans. The batter pack feature is really nice, too. You can't operate the fan while also using it to charge another device, but that's fine with me. It has amazing battery life, but the battery runs out a lot more quickly when being used as a charger than just as a fan, which is to be expected.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I picked this up for a future disney trip. I was doing a LOT of running around this summer and this fan checks all the boxes. First off, it has a lanyard so you can wear this around your neck and it actually blows really, really well. Also, the fan comes with a meter and I thought it was a gimmick but when you are running around outside, its actually nice to know whether your down to 25% or still have 90% so you can use more or less of the fan on a long day. I measured the length of the battery on high, which is level 5 and going the entire time, I am getting about 5 hours on high straight use, which is very reasonable.I also love how you can charge the fan using the standard USB-C charger, and it can also double and charge your devices as well (5W max emergency use per the manual) In order to do this, you will need a USB-C to USB-C cable. NOTE: in order to charge the fan, you will need a USB-A to USB-C cable, at least thats what I noticed at my house anyway and per the manual. This is also functional as you can use it as a desk fan, which I actually used on low during a interview where I had to be in my dining room as I wanted the perfect background for a zoom meeting but did not have a fan. This is quiet on low and reasonable quiet on high. Most importantly it actually blows, moves lots of air and keeps you cool.",

I was impressed by the powerful airflow yet the quietness of the fan. My coworker uses it for her flashes and although I don't suffer from them, I have a sister who I decide to gift one. It can be hand held, fold to rest on a desk or string to use around your neck. The more I thought about how it worked for my coworker, (she gave a demonstration) the more I wanted one for myself. It has 6 setting of airspeed and the battery is a beast. I have been running it for mins. and it still shows 100%. According to my coworker, she uses it daily and charges it every week. The value add is it has a C-port to charge the fan but also doubles as a charging port for any electronic device. (No you cannot charge a device and use the fan simultaneously.)",
