                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Really Cool little fan that moves a lot of air! It has TWO! Different fans in one enclosure! The two sets of blades spin to really get the air going! Even on the very lowest setting it gives a strong breeze! I haven\u2019t used it in the highest setting because i haven\u2019t needed it! The fan also oscillates and tilts to get the perfect angle. It\u2019s really cool that you can set the fan manually via the dial AND STILL USE THE REMOTE TO ADJUST IT! Fan can also be hung upside down with the folding hook! The kids LOVE the light settings and light shows. It is a nice feature if you need to set the fan somewhere on the floor in the dark\u2026easily prevents tripping over the fan in the middle of the night! Battery lasts a long time on the lowest setting and it will run if plugged in and keep the battery charged. You can also use it to charge or power other items via usb port. The Fan Base has a little slot that has been driving me crazy! I don\u2019t know what it does or why it\u2019s there? It\u2019s not listed on the manual. Doesn\u2019t interfere with use, just funny that it\u2019s there and obvious, but don\u2019t know why? The other feature i wish was added would be the ability to dim the \u201cwhite\u201d light for a dimmer night time use. Wonderful little fan!",

This fan worked well, moved air nicely, and the color-changing lights were fabulous. It was on the heavier side of what I wanted so I attached it to my pop-up tent above my kitchen set up and it was perfect. Over a 5-day camping trip, it charged several small USB items and my cell phone several times. I loved changing the light color to red/purple at night so it wasn't so harsh and you could still see while trying to find your camp site at night.",

It can either stand alone on a flat surface, or hang from the attached hook. It also has a remote control with onboard storage which makes it even more versatile.First, I charged it completely and ran it on low fan speed to see how long it would run on a full charge. It ran just short of 24 hours! Then, it took 6 hours to fully charge via the USB plug.I'm very happy with the quality and performance of this rechargeable fan and recommend it highly.",

Great tent fan for camping, and the two color temperature (warm white and cool white) options for the light is a great feature. Multiple brightness settings as well. The hanging hook could be designed better so you may want to use a carabiner to attach it to something overhead.",
