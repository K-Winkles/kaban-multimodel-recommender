A3: I have taken this handheld fan on over five flights since purchasing it and have had no issues carrying it in my purse through TSA. It can also double as a power bank to charge your phone if needed, which is very convenient in airports or on long flights with masks. I now carry it with me in my purse daily. Q4:How do u turn on the portable charger? A4:Simply plug in the charging cable to the USB output and it will start charging right away. ATTENTION: 1. This mini fan's battery complies with international safety standards, and you can carry it on transportation such as airplanes and high-speed trains. 2. If the battery voltage is below 3.5V, the power bank cannot charge the phone, but the fan and flashlight can still work normally. If you encounter this situation, please fully charge the power bank before charging your phone.",

With the base you can position this fan in several positions. This fan doesn\u2019t take long to recharge. The noise level is not overwhelming on the second speed. Neat way to beat those hot summer days.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. UPDATE 08/11/2023: So, unfortunately I had to remove 2 stars giving it 3 now instead of 5. The biggest reason for that is after using the fan for a while, the function of turning off if the blades can\u2019t move disappears\u2026 So, for example, let\u2019s say I have the fan running for 30 minutes while I\u2019m sitting at my desk at work, then I put it back in my bag when I\u2019m finished using it. If the \u201con\u201d button gets pressed somehow in my bag, the fan will keep running- even if it\u2019s completely closed and the blades can\u2019t move. One of the biggest reasons that I purchased a new fan was because my old one would do the same thing, and when I would go to use it, it would be dead and feel really warm. The fan does everything else it\u2019s supposed to though; it definitely has a lot of power to it and a long battery life. It really is disappointing that the \u201cturning off when the blades can\u2019t move\u201d function doesn\u2019t work though\u2026OG 05/07/2023: The \u201cwhite\u201d fan is so cute and works really well! This is the 3rd fan like this I\u2019ve purchased, but this is the first time I\u2019ve had this specific fan from this specific store. The one I had previously was extremely easy to turn on, when closed, and it would stay on even in the fan was folded up and the blades couldn\u2019t move. This fan will not stay on for longer than 2 seconds if it is closed and the blades can\u2019t spin (shown in video). Also, the on light and charging light are different colors! Green and blue respectively. The blades stop spinning if you lightly tap it with your hand (video) , and they are made of soft, thin plastic, so they won\u2019t cause any injuries. The fan is also amazing for hot flashes/weather! I fully charged it, then turned it on before I went to sleep. I slept for approximately 7.5 hours, and it was still running on the 2nd fastest speed when I woke up! Definitely recommend \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd",
