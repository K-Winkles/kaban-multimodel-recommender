So when they messaged me requesting feedback I told them I was dissatisfied. Without any hesitation they sent a replacement because the original purchase was defective. I received the replacement and now I am completely satisfied. It charges fast so I don't have to wait longer than 3 hours to get a full charge. Also the fan is so powerful it makes a very hot room feel like a extremely cool environment. The light is so bright that it can light up an entire room. The fan lasts longer than 13 hours on a full charge. Even with two light indicators it lasted for more than five hours. I am completely satisfied with the quality of the service and how the fan works.",

It is a bit bulky to pack in a suitcase but only adds a pound or two. Airflow is good on medium and high when using as a night time sleeping fan, and the battery lasted all night (7 hours) as well with some still left. The fan is on the quieter side and so we brought a noise machine with us. The two together were perfect. We'll be bringing it again for another cruise in six months. We've also used it as a stroller fan to cool down our kiddo and which again it worked perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this myself and not a paid review.As per reported by another user, did not get the advertised 58hrs of run time. Running the fan on the lowest possible setting, i got 33hrs and 20 mins of run time from a full battery (i ran the fan 31hrs continuously and followed by another 2hrs and 20 mins after a couple of hours break).For this i'm rating it as 4/5 since it fell short of the advertised time. I suspect the reason for this is that even though on its lowest setting, the fan speed is actually really strong (i think it has to do with the variable potential meter used to control the fan speed). On mine at the lowest setting, the wind speed is about the same as a Dyson fan at setting 4, so that could be the cause of the reduced battery life. Still good enough for my use case as a fan when im outdoors for this summer.",

                "reviewText": "The 1st unit I received didn't work 100%. Unit arrived charged so it did turn on, but only one of the two blades worked (spun around) and the onboard light didn't work either. I went back to the Amazon site to get a replacement and took the bad unit back to a KOHLS store that night I got it.Amazon did me right because I received a replacement THE NEXT DAY!Unit #2 came charged up.PROS: Both sets of blades and the onboard light worked as it should.Fan was quiet as advertised but to be honest I'll be using the fan for when I play with my band so fan noise was never a selling point to me.Brightness of light was pretty decent although I did try it out in a lit room.The air breeze it generated was a good flow. I like that you can vary the fan speed to your liking.It came with a USB to USB-C cable but did not include a wall charger. Fan has two USB ports on it: USB and USB-C. Not sure if you can charge a phone from it. Nothing on the box or the instructions indicates such...CONS: The instruction manual I found to be completely lacking. Please forgive me but it was like broken English transcribed to print. It basically contained all the info printed on the box with no other specific details. I basically had to tinker around to see how to work it.Gave it 4 stars because no real good instructions were given and the 1st fan I got didn't work right.",
