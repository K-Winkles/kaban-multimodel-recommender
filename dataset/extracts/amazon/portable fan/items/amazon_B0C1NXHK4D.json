                "reviewText": "I love that this fan can be tilted towards my face! No other fan can adjust the angle of the wind blowing towards your face. My only concern would be that the battery life needs to be larger. This one lasted me about 4 hours on high speed. I have since bought another type that has a 10,000 mAh and another one that has 12,000 mAh batteries!! They last ALL day on high! I work 16.5 hour shifts and that 12,000mAh battery goes all day on high. The 10,000 mAh lasts about 12 hours on high. So what I do is, I cycle them out. I use this one that can be directed to my face until the battery runs out and then I switch to either of the other 2. Yes the 12,000 mAh one is a lot heavier. But I've worn it all day around my neck with no issues. The 10,000mAh one doesn't weight much more than this one and will last 12 hours on high fan speed. Increase the mAh rating on this one to 10,000 or 12,000 and this would definitely get a 5 Star rating from me, because in every other aspect except battery life and high fan speed, this one is better because it's DIRECTIONAL and can be pointed directly at the face at an angle each individual would want.",
