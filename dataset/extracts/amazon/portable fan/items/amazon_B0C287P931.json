I say it's the BMW of handheld fans! It has 6 speeds and performs very well. It has a C charging port and a USB. I really like that I can hang it around my neck or I can set it on a table during use. If you want a good quality fan get this one!",

                "reviewText": "I love battery powered fans. Especially the ones with powerbank sized batteries. Although I don't use the powerbank feature, I know there is plenty of battery capacity on these types. This one is no different.Obviously, the higher the capacity of battery, the larger and bulkier it will be. This fan has a 6000ah battery which is pretty impressive for a fan that is light enough to carry around your neck. It's not heavy and you can walk around with it and for get that it's there because its really light.I'm not going to go over the features because you can read about that in the description. I will, however, share some things that is not there. I haven't really tested every speed and how long the battery lasts because I use the fan intermittently through the day. I so use this camping for white noise and cooling so I know that it will last all though the night on speed 1 (9+hrs). I also know that if you leave this on speed 5, which is the highest constant speed, it will last only about 1.5 hours.I've used this for camping, fishing, music festivals, amusement parks, and airplane trips. Basically this thing is a life saver if you must be out in the heat of summer. I bought one for each family member before we went to Busch Gardens last month and they all thanked me for making standing in lines in 90\u00b0 heat much more bearable. We just stuck them all in a small backpack when we got to the ride. I gave myself a pat on the back for bringing it on a recent plane trip to Boston. I had one stop in Charlotte and both planes were delayed on the tarmac. They both were struggling to keep the cabin cool while on the ground so it was HOT sitting there, but I had my fan around my neck and stayed cool. I turned it off just to see if it made a difference and it was unbearable!The only reason I knocked one star off is because I wish that it was more efficient with battery power on the highest setting. On really, really hot days, you need the high speed to get the best cooling relief. I realize it's probably not realistic to expect something this small and light to push large amounts of air for hours.That being said, I would go ahead and get one for yourself and try it out. Get an additional one for a gift to anyone. They'll love it!I hope this information has been helpful to someone \ud83d\ude42",

You can feel your hand and forearm vibrating as well after holding it for a while.Battery life: #3 consumes 1% battery life every 90 seconds, so it will last about 2.5 hours. #1 consumes about 1% battery life every 5 minutes.Note: the sticker is not part of the design.",
