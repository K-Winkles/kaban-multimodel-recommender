I bought this fan for when I set up a table for my job and have to sit outside in the SoCal sun. It works, the light is good, and the battery lasts a decent while. It lasts anywhere from 4-8 hours on a single charge, which is plenty for me. I only wish it were a little more powerful. I have it blowing at 100% whenever I use it, and I keep it within 5 ft of my face. Anything beyond that is unnoticeable.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this fan for a 13,500 mile trip to Alaska, Texas and back to NC this past August. The seller said that, when fully-charged it should last about 8 hours on high and over 30 hours on low. The speed is variable I used this fan on medium for two full nights during my first few days out - without recharging. I did that again later in the trip. I would normally charge it (USB) while driving during the day and then use it every night. It NEVER died on me - not once. It performed at least as well as the seller's claims, ran quietly, and moved enough air to keep the closed van comfortable on warm August nights! The built in light (3-level) also came in extremely handy when I had to get out of the van at night. Well worth the money. I am so pleasantly surprised that I plan to buy another one just to have around...Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this fan to be used daily at my work station to use when the AC is off, being battery powered I can use my solar setup to recharge without using house power and it's a good size and pushes a good amount of air, that is until it doesn't. I don't know if this is normal or not, but between 20 minutes and 45 minutes of use, the fan will kick itself out of \"high\" the knob turned to the highest setting. You then have to turn it off and then back off again and it goes back into \"high\". Maybe not a big deal for me since it's sitting right next to me, but for people that are going to use this while they sleep, this could be an issue as the air flow is significant enough to be noticeable. If it wasn't for this, it would be a 5 star fan because everything else is fine, battery life, the light, the weight, build quality, it's just that one issue that brings it down.",
