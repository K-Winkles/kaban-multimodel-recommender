I picked this model because it was affordable, rechargeable and has a digital display of the battery power. That\u2019s so helpful especially when I take it out and about on hot days so I know exactly how long it has left. I highly recommend this small but mighty personal fan!",

Low speed is for longer battery life but the battery lasts a long time. The only thing I don't like is that the base is too loose. It should be tighter so it won't come off all the time and get lost.",

I'm glad I bought this one because it kept me quite comfortable. It's powerful enough to keep me cool. And I do believe I'm going through perimenopause because I'm having hot flashes like crazy and this comes in handy. Hands free cooling is great. The battery seems to last pretty long. I charged it when I received it and I haven't had to charge it yet again.It's small. Which is great. It has a little stand so I can leave it on the table, or I can pop it out of the stand and hold it up to my neck or wherever I'm having hot flashes lol.It came with a cord, which idk what to do with so I threw it in a drawer.There's a display screen for battery life, which is nice.My niece and nephew liked it too. They stole it and were using it to cool down and blow their hair around. It's pretty powerful for a little fan.I have no negatives or complaints with this fan. Love it. I might get a few more. It would come in handy for power outages when we would have no AC or fans going. And I wouldn't have to carry it from room to room. Maybe that's what that cord was for. So I'd never be without my handy dandy fan.",
