                "reviewText": "The mirror comes with two mounting methods, regular screws with anchors and double sided tape. For most purposes, the tape will be plenty strong as the mount together with the mirror don't weight all that much and you don't have to put holes in your walls/tile. The only qualm here is that it would be nice if the mirror also had side to side tilt, but up/down is fine enough. Mirror can be removed from the mount for recharging. Mount is made out of very thick and substantial plastic, and has a folding shelf.The mirror itself doesn't seem to have a waterproof rating, but appears to be plenty waterproof for splashes. The USB-C port is covered with a gasket, and as long as it's facing down, it should be safe from any moisture ingress. Heats up fairly fast, and is truly fogless. Three different lighting temperatures.The main advantage to me is the massive internal battery. Most mirrors of this type have significantly less, or are not as resistant to moisture due to needing to have a battery compartment. Having this be a large rechargeable battery means less time spent recharging and swapping out batteries. Also, the USB-C port does charge via a C-C cable so the correct circuitry is included for futureproofing, even though an A-C cable is used by default.Other accessories are not very notable, but nice to have - small scissors and tweezers.Very recommended due to the great feature list and a reasonable price point.",

                "reviewText": "I've always needed one of these but with no power behind the shower wall, I was stuck. When this came available, it was a no-brainer to try. I was initially concerned as my shower area has a curved textured tile wall - BUT no worries! The adhesive pad is Super Sticky AND at 4-1/4\" is just slightly wider than my 3-1/4\" tiles. It is thick enough that the overlap is No Problem AND it easily handled my textured tile. I did use a level to ensure correct placement AND I did let it sit for the recommended 12 hours before re-attaching the mirror panel (plenty of time for the mirror to charge). You need to be very careful when placing this (start in one corner, then down one edge) because once its stuck, It Is Stuck! There is a tiny LED indicator at the bottom of the mirror: red = charging, green = full, blue = heating (it comes with tweezers, a small scissors, an extra glue pad, mounting hardware, and the USB-A to C charging cable but not the power block). The battery is 5Ah and the mirror heater is 12 Watt - assuming the standard 3.7V Lithium battery the heater should run for 1.54 Hr (9 ten minute cycles) between recharging.",
