                "reviewText": "One of the corners of the packaging was busted open. Fortunately the mirror was undamaged. The actually packaging work was superb. 2 pieces of thick and sturdy wood strips were included in addition to foam corner coverings and foam covers for the mirror.There were some streaks on the mirror, water and microfiber cloths took care of that.the installation was very easy using the hooks. On the back of the frame there are 2 holes each side. Each hook has 4 holes. There are 4 screws for installing. The reason each hook has 4 holes is for height adjustment. Screw in the lower holes, the mirror hangs lower, higher holes, the mirror hangs higher. The difference is maybe about 2 in. I'm 5'4\", so I went with lower ones. Works just fine.The mirror is very clear and not much to say about that. The frame is sturdy. Having a full length mirror does help tremendously if you care how look you from head to toe. Makes a great difference in choosing clothing. The lights in my walk-in closet are bright and I felt I was approximating the experience of buying clothes at a store trying on online bought outfits, without having to go to a store, which is pain in the butt for a guy like me.Simple tool for maximum benefit for me, ymmv.Overall: A",

I think that if would be great for an apartment, in that you wouldn't have to worry about the holes in the wall to keep your landlord happy. It was well packaged and arrived in good condition.cons: It does move and bang the door when opening and shutting your door. It doesn't move sideways, just back and forth. I feel like after awhile this might cause some problems as in wear and tear. Also, I am waiting to see if it makes marks on my door because of this. I don't know that because I haven't had it that long, it's just an assumption.I probably wouldn't buy again, but overall I give it a 3.",
