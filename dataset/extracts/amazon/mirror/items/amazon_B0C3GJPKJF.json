Right out of the box, it spoils you with a bag to cradle the mirror, a Type C charger, and the mirror itself. The rechargeable feature is a game-changer; It lasts almost a week on one charge. Recharging is a breeze \u2013 plug it in, wait for the green light, and you're good to go. The two soft-touch buttons on the left handle power, and a long press adjusts the brightness. On the right, toggle between yellow, white, and blue hues. My favorite feature is the adjustable frame, perfect for different surfaces, ensuring the mirror stays put for flawless makeup application. Highly recommend for those in need of a portable, well-lit and compact mirror.",

                "reviewText": "I just received this today, so I can\u2019t speak to longevity. However, on first impression I\u2019m really impressed with this and I wish I\u2019d had this years ago as it would have made travel so much easier!! The lights are adjustable but generally so much brighter capability than I\u2019d expected, so I\u2019m really pleased with that. I mostly like the design\u2026it\u2019s pretty sleek and feels like a good weight (not too light or heavy). The only thing I wish is that the height was adjustable with maybe a telescoping stand or something. As it is, you have three different heights and those are the only options (one height is all three parts in a triangle shape, the second height is the second picture shown in the listing, and then the final height shown in the listing photo is achieved by flipping the mirror around to the other side of the stand). Overall, seems like a great product for the price.",
