Will be buying another to finish the whole room because they look so nice. Great for the price! 1 single wall of peel and stick wallpaper cost me $140. I can do the whole room for $60.",

Absolutely beautiful result. We had to reposition one or 2 polka dots and it was easy to do.I do not believe this will ruin paint, but only time will tell.",

I\u2019m not sure why it doesn\u2019t look very cute, they\u2019re a pretty color and polka dots (the cutest print) but for some reason it doesn\u2019t look that great on my walls. I put them in my nursery and I\u2019m just not loving it. Also, some of them peel off but they restick when you push on them. I\u2019m going to paint my walls, that might help the look of it.",
