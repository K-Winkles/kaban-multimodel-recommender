It was a choice of either only seeing my left ear (or not at all) or having the tablet so angled that it was difficult to see. It was also a pretty grainy image. I do admit, though, that that could have been because of the lighting at the time. However, the whole point of having a mirror on a portable device is because you aren't in a well lit bathroom.Even though I ended up uninstalling it, I still wanted to give it at least three stars because it is a free app and I appreciate the trouble the designer went through to design it and post it for free.",
