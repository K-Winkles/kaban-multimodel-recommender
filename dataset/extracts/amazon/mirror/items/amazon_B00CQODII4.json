I wouldn't suggest anyone other than an electrician install ANY fixture.It is a beautiful chandelier, made of good materials. It does hang a little crooked, as other reviewers have said. That may have more to do with the way the chain connects, and less to do with any difference in the weight of each \"arm\".I'll figure a barely-noticable way to weight down the arm that's now highest. Our local hardware store should have something.... but if not, it isn't so crazily out of kilter than most people would notice. It's nonetheless a 4-star very good value and nice addition to the eat-in kitchen.",

Simple design compliments simplistic decor of my living room very well.The first product I received had to be returned due to the fact that vertical rod was welded crocked causing the lamps to not level out. Of course, being Amazon, return and replacement was easy and fast.Then, I discovered, first product (original) and the second product (replacement) were not identical. While first one had glass pieces in white without any tint, second one had an obvious green tint. They were also a bit longer. The second one had a threaded rod inside the vertical piece where as first one did not. It doesn't affect functionality but it has (obviously) gone through a design change. Boxing and packing were also different.Installation is very easy and straight forward. 3 wires (including ground) connection and I was done. The actual hanging requires one to open up two of the rings of the chain. As they are made of thick wires, I needed a big wrench and a vice.Overall, it was a very good purchase. I would buy it again.",

This isn't a big deal since it's not noticeable, but I would've liked them better with a solid, smooth look.",
