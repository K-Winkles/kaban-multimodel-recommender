                "reviewText": "this mirror is pretty compact and it's very bright, the battery lasts a very long time. I bought this mirror back in June 2021 and it's now October 2022. I've only had to charge the battery 4 times in over a year. Granted, I don't use the mirror for very long. I'd say I use the mirror for about 20-25 minutes and it lasted me a really long time still. Obviously, if you use the mirror a lot or for hours at a time doing complex looks, it'll definitely take more charging. the mirror is nice and the only complaint I have is the stand on the back. it's super flimsy and just recently broke the other day. the mirror has become wobbly and doesn't stay up right unless it is propped against something. I think if the stand was designed differently or maybe even just with thicker material, it would have been a lot more stable. I won't be purchasing this mirror again due to this issue but it's definitely not a bad product. It's cheap and I think I got my money's worth.",

Easy to charge, lasts through lots of uses before needing to charge again, the stand can be adjusted for a different tilt.Only downside for me is I wish it had a cover- but not a deal breaker for me",

The light is great as well, it can be very bright or dim and is easily adjustable. It also lasts a very long time - the light worked when I first opened the package and I haven\u2019t charged it at all (although I\u2019ve only used it for 10-20 minutes everyday for the past 3 weeks). Basically, the product does what it\u2019s supposed to do really well.",
