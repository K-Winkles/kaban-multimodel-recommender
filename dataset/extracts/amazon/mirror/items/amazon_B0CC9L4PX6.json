                "reviewText": "I have been slowly acquiring more and more mirrors for our home gym, and I'm so happy to have stumbled upon these!I've seen some other products that are less of a true mirror and more of a reflective film, but these are definitely true mirror squares. They're not super thick, but I'm glad because they're lightweight, and I'm not concerned about them pulling away from their adhesive stickers.There are a total of 12 squares, which I stuck all together to make a long mirror. Despite the lines between each pane, it's still totally fine for seeing your form when you're standing square to it (things look more distorted because I took the pictures at an angle).If you're looking to make a mirror wall or wanting to create a big mirrored space in your home gym, I think buying a few packs of these is much more economical than trying to come by a gigantic mirror. It's important to note, though, that they caution against trying to put these on wallpapered surfaces, textured surfaces, or uneven surfaces.When applying these, I came to realize that the wall I stuck them on is actually bowed out a bit, and while the mirrors still stuck, I really had to mash the last one down for a while to get it to hold (the others were no problem at all).The mirrors come with a ton of adhesive squares. Ours are hung up with one in each corner, and a fifth in the middle, but you could do WAY more squares than that if you wanted, since you get so many. Great product for a great price!",

                "reviewText": "I'm really happy with these mirrors. They arrived in very secure packaging and I didn't receive any that were chipped, or damaged. They should be easy to install on almost any flat, clean surface. I stuck them to the wall in my home gym and it really made the room feel bigger and added to the brightness of the room as they reflected light from the windows. The versatility of being able to arrange them in any pattern is great, but I stuck with the boring rectangular layout for my room. No complaints and I'm considering purchasing more.",

I was going to use all of them but one came chipped Otherwise, these are very light weight, smooth and excellent clarity. It came with stickers but I am not likely to use those as I prefer larger surface grip with possible light framing. But the overall quality is great!",
