They were right, there are TWO layers of film, and removing the second layer makes this easy to view. Images are now clear, and I can shave safely in the shower. Highly recommended item!",

I've let all kinds of soap and water get on it and haven't wiped it down or anything and it's still perfectly clear enough for me to see. Does exactly what I needed to do and my super small inconvenience is no problem anymore.Also weird to see myself in the various stages of soaps in my hair, ears, face.",

Though the manner of installation left much to be desired, I am able to safely shave in the shower now without fear of the mirror dropping and shattering glass all over the shower floor. Thanks to the plexiglass fabrication, this lightweight mirror will not shatter with a fall and provides a clear reflection to work from. I would definitely seek this mirror out again as an option to mirrors for the shower.",

                "reviewText": "I never gave it much thought before, but after seeing this shower mirror and picking it up I'm now wondering why I never thought about getting one before. I always shave in the shower, and then I would sometimes get out and noticed that I missed a spot and have to touch up once I was already drying off. But no more! This mirror is about the size of a sheet of paper, is as clear as a bell, and didn't actually fog up while I showered. It comes with a hook that sticks to the shower wall (clean and dry first of course), and so far it has held up fine. I love it! One thing I will mention. Mine came with 2 coatings of that thin, invisible plastic that you have to peel off. After I peeled off the first, it still looked a bit hazy, that's when I discovered I had a second layer to peel off. Once I did it was perfect.",

                "reviewText": "For a plastic mirror, this provides a very clear reflection. It is not really fog free. Any cold mirror will fog up in a hot shower. It is possible to warm this mirror up by holding it under the running water for a minute. The water does seem to bead up on it as if it has some kind of Rain X coating. It comes with a hook with double-sided tape. I chose to use a suction cup. Overall, this is a good mirror but not fog free",
