The mirror is pretty lightweight so I was even able to hang it on just two nails that I have, since I could make a hole in my wall for the included screws.The mirror is flat and looks good.It was a little shorter than I had expected but that\u2019s on me for not reading the height measurement.I definitely prefer this mirror to be hanging on the wall as opposed to standing or leaning since it\u2019s not super tall.",

The design is elegant and the mirror came without scratches.",
