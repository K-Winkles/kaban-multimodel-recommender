                "reviewText": "I really like that this compact mirror is rechargable and easy to travel. It feels durable in the hand and not dinky. The mirrors are clear and not distorted. The light is just bright enough without a heavy glare like some similar products. The only thing I don't like is that it closes very securely and it's a bit tricky to open.There are three tiny raised dots on the front edge of the lid. You are supposed to be able to grab and lift the lid with this. However, my fingers just slide right over it. I have to insert a fingernail under the lid to grab it and pop it up. That would make it difficult if someone keeps their nails trimmed down or if they have an expensive manicure they don't want to chip. I would love to see an improvement on this.Overall, this is a very good mirror other than the issue above. Great quality and it's attractive.",

                "reviewText": "There is some comfort in purchasing a product from a familiar, known name brand with a good reputation. Conair is one of those brand names. The compact mirror with lighting feature is exactly as described and shown in the product details.It is competently designed, with quality materials and manufacture. The product feels like a solidly crafted product. Some compact mirrors have dimmable lights, or levels of brightness. This has one setting, which is fine. It provides ample illumination. Perhaps more importantly, it's a ring around the 1X mirror and affords an even lighting. Instead of different lighting intensity or dimming function, it just provides a quality lighting instance.A full charged battery will provide up to 3 hours of operating time, which is a generous capacity. To achieve this amount of lighting time, requires a large capacity battery. This would account for the thickness of the compact. Although, to be fair, the compact dimensions are in line with other comparable products.The small power button is located near the rear of the compact. Personally, I found this to be an odd position. I thought it would have been wiser to have it at the front of the compact. The button is rather small. Maybe having it close to the charging port makes it easier to find.The color is a darker blue than the illustrations in the product details. The significant other thought that there should be at least a pink option. Red would also be a worthwhile option. After all, a compact is marketed to women. I think she makes a valid point.Attached are photos to show real world images of the compact, with a ruler to show size reference. I included a close up of the back of the compact, showing the location of the charging port and small power button.Overall, it's a well crafted compact. The LED lighting is nicely implemented. Based on initial impressions, this compact reflects well upon the Conair reputation. It earns a 4.5 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",

I found lots of options on Amazon, but opted for this one because I trust the Conair name, and it's rechargeable. The light is nice and bright, and seems to last for ages without recharging (I haven't had to recharge it since buying it). It seems pricey at first glance, but performs better than I expected, and I've recommended it to others.",
