        "description": "Product Description THE BROKEN MIRROR (Trompe l'oeli)Anne Lawrence lives in Brussels, where she works as a restorer of rare paintings. When Anne becomes pregnant, her widowed mother visits her, which brings back memories from Anne's past. Her mother asks Anne about the time she went missing and was found, lost in the city, clutching a strange painting with no knowledge of where it came from. Anne is fascinated by the painting but also scared of it. She becomes determined to discover why it now seems so important to her. Strange incidents start to occur. Anne is pursued through empty streets by a large car with a hidden driver. She sees a man with a gloved right hand watching her from the deserted house across the street. She becomes frightened by her own reflection in mirrors. As Anne sinks ever deeper into the mystery of her past, she finds herself entering a nightmare of fear and sudden violence from which she seems unable to escape. Review It ultimately resolves to be something eerie and beautiful. --piltdownworship, LetterboxdThis film is creepy and gorgeous to look at. Mondo Macabro nails another deep cut yet again! --TEAM3MF, LetterboxdA cinematographic treatise on insanity and degradation. --Louis Chauvet, Le Figaro (on UNQUIET DEATH)",
