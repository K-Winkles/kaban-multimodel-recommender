It was filthy, covered in fingerprints and smudged, and there was no plastic cover over the mirrors themselves. The mirror was also dislodged from the holes in the wood to keep it in place but that was an easy fix. Yes it works as intended but still lame it arrived dirty.",

                "reviewText": "I use the mirror to activate a motion sensor light in a closet. The closet light sensor was positioned in a bad spot, so the closet light never turned on when the closet door opened. Now, when I open the closet door, light reflects off the mirror, hits the light sensor, and turns the closet light on. Voila!Works pretty well.",
