                "reviewText": "For a quick, on-the-go mirror that takes up little space, this is the one to get. The brightness is more than satisfactory and there are different settings that are easier on your eyes while still supplying sufficient light.One of the things I didn't like about it, though, was the battery life. I find myself charging it 1-2 times a week as my girlfriend and I use it for our skincare routines as well as her makeup. The charging cable that it comes with was very short, so I use my own. I don't expect many people have a longer micro-usb cable on them these days, but if you do you shouldn't have much of a problem. Another thing I didn't like was that the mirror only angles about 45 degrees, which should be satisfactory for most but I like having the mirror relatively close to my face without having to crane my neck to the table its on.Despite these personal issues, I would say that for the general buyer this is a great mirror to get. It does what it needs to and I use it every single day. I don't plan on getting another anytime soon.",

                "reviewText": "This mirror is exactly what I needed for traveling, as any regular makeup wearer knows that lighting for doing your makeup is often disastrous in hotels/guest rooms/ect. It has three light hues, all of which are great for application. I enjoy it so much that I actually just ended up using it every day since I got it.The downside is that it doesn't always hold a charge long enough (timing being subjective of course, depending how long you take). I've been using it daily for a little over a year, and I've noticed that it dies quicker and quicker as time passes on. I take 20-30 mins to do my makeup and the last few months have had me charging it MULTIPLE times while I'm doing my makeup (after leaving it charging all night before). I don't have/can't afford a good set up for doing makeup, so I legitimately need this little well-lit mirror. It used to stay charged during my entire application, until it hit about 1 year of daily use. This week, it's started randomly turning on while it's charging, which is a sign that it's time to replace it and/or find something better.Overall good for quick applications and travel. Bad for spending quality time doing a full face, drinking coffee, messing around on your phone, and taking your time. You'll be racing against the clock using this and that's not how I like to spend my morning getting ready personally.",
