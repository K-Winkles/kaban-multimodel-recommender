        "description": "The Mirror has Two Faces Rose Morgan (Barbra Streisand), who still lives with her mother (Lauren Bacall), is a professor of Romantic Literature who desperately longs for passion in her life. Gregory Larkin (Jeff Bridges) a mathematics professor, has been burned by passionate relationships and longs for a sexless union based on friendship and respect. They're two people with almost nothing in common, but Fate in the form of a personal ad and a meddling sister brings them together. And without physical attraction to complicate matters, Rose and Greg become best friends and soon agree to an unconventional marriage builton intellectual passion instead of sexual heat. But when two people meet, marry, try to remain celibate and then fall in love they realize they are courting chaos. Directed by Streisand and co-starring Pierce Brosnan, George Segal, Mimi Rogers and Brenda Vaccaro, The Mirror has Two Faces explores our modern myths of sex and beauty with a brilliant combination of humor and poignancy that makes it \"the year's best romantic comedy\". (Jim Ferguson, Prevue Channel) Prince of Tides Barbra Streisand and Nick Nolte star in the stunning screen adaptation of Pat Conroy's best-selling novel, the Prince of Tides. Nolte is Tom Wingo, a disillusioned Southern coach who must reveal his tortured childhood in order to help his suicidal sister. Streisand is Susan Lowenstein, the determined psychiatrist who battles Tom's resentment and rage in search of the truth. Their antagonism gradually gives way to love, as Tom and Susan find the secret that unlocks his sister's torment and the courage to change their own lives. Critically acclaimed as the best movie of the year, the Prince of Tides was hailed by Jeffrey Lyons as a blockbuster, must-see, can't-miss movie. Streisand also won rave reviews as director, assembling a superlative supporting cast that includes Blythe Danner, Kate Nelligan, Jeroen Krabb. The Way We Were Screen legends Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford make movie magic as the captivating star-crossed lovers, Hubbell Gardiner and Katie Morosky. Theirs is a classic love story sparked by the attraction of opposites, played out against the backdrop of American life during times of foreign war, domestic prosperity and McCarthy-era paranoia in Hollywood. Winner of two 1974 Academy Awards(r) (Best Song \"The Way We Were\" and Best Score), this special 25th Anniversary Edition of the The Way We Were has been digitally remastered so you can enjoy this romantic epic the way it was meant to be seen and heard.",

The way we were had the classic clash between two ideals, the Prince had a man coming to grip with his life and finding out it wasn't all that bad, something we all should do and the third was witty, funny, charming, emotional and fun. It was a film that was not well reviewed at the time however I thought that the concept of the film was great. TYwo people hurt by love and being lonely, trying to come to grips with life and finding what they wanted was right there all the time, each just had to have a good reason to make the change which they did. I loved Bacallas the mother. This is a collection films you should have and enjoy over and over. I on;y sold it as I got te collection that also contained Funny girl which I love.",

I've been shopping through amazon since I can remember and almost never had a problem; the first time I've order this item from another seller and it was a nightmare, the charge my account for the full price of this article and they shipped the wrong item that was also cheaper. When I called Amazon customer service to report this the agent on the phone was amazing, not only did he knew how to resolve the issue immediatelly, he issued a refund and recommended this seller that had the same article for a fraction of the cost. This seller was very efficent filling the order, it was perfectly packed and it arrived on time. I couldn't be happier!! I would definitely recommend this seller and would be buying more from him in the near future and their prices are great too. :0)",

                "reviewText": "The Way We Were is just a fantastic movie. It seems to have a lot of activity and events swirling around, but the heart of the movie to me, is two people with vastly different personalities, as well as friends..appearance, etc. colliding, due to the feeling each has, that something is missing within themselves. They're both trying to figure out their own personalities, by way of each other. When they were together as a couple, both were actually internally fighting who they really were as individuals. Apart, they are free to be themselves...a tear jerker every time.Ahh, The Prince of Tides. A must watch for me anytime I'm in the low country or longing for the low country! A total chick flick that needs a comfy throw and a bowl of popcorn!The Mirror Has Two Faces...stays neatly in it's packaging.",

'The Mirror Has Two Faces' and 'The Way We Were' have been in my top ten favorites since I first saw them and 'The Prince of Tides' is an excellent movie also. They are all three poignant love stories and I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone who hasn't seen them. To me, the mark of a good movie is that it can make you laugh and make you cry. All three of these have that quality. Buy this collection and enjoy it.",

If what you're looking for is the movies, then this is great value. This package lacks the extras that we associate with dvds - and this is the major flaw in this collection.The Way We Were - long and at times plodding but characteristic of the romance movies of the 70s; the killer is the final 15 minutes of the film - makes the whole journey almost worthwhile.The Prince of Tides - scrumptuous cinematography; the most 'arty' of Streisand's directorial efforts. Nick Nolte should've won an oscar for his layered and sensitive playing of Tom Wingo.The Mirror Has Two Faces - competent romantic comedy. The gem in the film is Lauren Bacall.Perhaps the package would've made more sense if it included all three of Streisand's directorial efforts so we can witness her range and growth as a director?",

                "reviewText": "This box set is such fantastic value. I live in Australia but purchased it from Amazon as it was such a great price - even including the postage. I had never seen Prince of Tides or The Way We Were so it was great to receive the box set and have the opportunity to see more Barbra Streisand movies. Both the older movies were such sad and emotional movies so if you enjoy an emotionally charged movie you will love them. Personally I prefer Mirror with Two faces. It has some excellent humour and interesting insight about man and women psychie. Highly recommended.",
