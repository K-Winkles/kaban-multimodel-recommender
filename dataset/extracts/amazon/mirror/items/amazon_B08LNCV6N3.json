                "reviewText": "I need a mirror like this to drive since my neck no longer works. Bought them in CVS and the handle was connected in only two (rubbery) points and were breaking off one after the other. Went on Amazon and found these. Inexpensive, bigger than the ones in CVS and the handle is molded in one piece with the mirror frame. You'ld work hard to CUT if off. No way is it falling off like the ones I bought. I bought three as I always need spares in case one breaks. Anyone whose neck no longer rotates sufficiently to make turns and cross instersections should have one. And I guess you could use it for fussing with hair and makeup too. I have no hair and don't use make up but for an inexpensive mirror, this puppy is rock solid.",

                "reviewText": "For the price, this mirror is fine. Nothing wrong with it, but its not great in terms of quality. For starters, the handle is very flimsy. When you hold the mirror up, if your hand shakes, the whole mirror shakes. But for under $10, can't complain too much. Not sure about long term usage though",
