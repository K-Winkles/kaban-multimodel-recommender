                "reviewText": "Lamentablemente no se aprecia en las fotos, pero es super buen producto, yo lo puse en la ducha para rasurar barba y cabeza (soy pelon \ud83e\udd23) y honestamente el tama\u00f1o de espejo es ligeramente m\u00e1s grande que en las fotos, lo cual eso es lo que yo buscaba, a muy pobre explicaci\u00f3n es m\u00e1s grande que el rostro (cara). Tiene una movilidad excelente y buen aumento. No se empa\u00f1a como un espejo normal, si se ha empa\u00f1ado muy poco 1 de cada 5 veces pero le arrojo agua y queda como nuevo por muuuucho tiempo. El pegamento y cup\u00f3n son perfectos para agarrarse en azulejo tambi\u00e9n. Yo lo recomiendo si buscas un espejo ligeramente m\u00e1s grande que un rastrillo y que se vea cabeza completa de cuello para arriba.",
