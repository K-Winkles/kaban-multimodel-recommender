If you don't have any knowledge (like myself) on how to install lighting or have someone that can install it for you - perhaps this isn't for you. All that said, the light is PERFECT for what I was after; it created the look I was after, it's bright enough to get dressed in and soft enough to create a \"romantic\" level in the bedroom. I wanted the 4 light chandelier and it's what came; all the parts (and even some extra) were included. I had all 4 bulbs (DO NOT TOUCH them without a glove!!) and all the nuts and bolts. This was a solid purchase and only took the hubby 35 minutes to install.",

Be sure to wear some gloves while handling the chrome plate to help prevent fingerprints.I would NOT recommend using the bulbs that come with the fixture as they are halogen and will get VERY hot. I swapped them out for LEDs and the issue with heat is no more, also to note that the light fixture itself is dimmable so that's a plus.As other reviewers have mentioned, don't bother with the instructions as they provide no help with installation--I was able to make it work but it was a good 3 hour process.I'm only rating this 3 stars due to the difficulty of installation and after I had assembled it, I found similar looking light fixtures for much cheaper--go figure right?",

It looks great,exactly like the picture.Its black in color so it went great with my decor being gray.I paid the amazon price of 129.00 of having an installer come and install this item...GLAD I DID!!,,unless you have a lot of patience don't bother because putting this chandelier together was indeed tedious!..For you women who have the time to put the bulbs and hang this,beware if you have long nails FORGET IT! have a professional put this together...The end result though FANTASTIC and very chic looking.....The installer was great,very professional,and he let know 3 days and then 1 day in advanced that he was coming on the day I picked...Would do this service again...",

                "reviewText": "I just installed this after receiving it today and I feel I have to write my first review.First, it does look similar to the photo but it is not accurate. The black fabric shell does not have the crystal strands, it is just the black fabric. There are not any strands for me to even put them on the shell. Either my order was missing the strands or the photo of this product is incorrect. Second, my fixture only had fifteen strands with balls and only fourteen hooks with one central hook on the base of the fixture for me to attach them too. The photo shows that there are eighteen strands with balls. The central hook hangs about two inches lower than the rest of the strands which is not as uniform looking as it is in the photo. Lastly the description states this fixture uses five 40watt bulbs that are not included. The bulbs were included with my order which was a bonus but it uses four G9 bulbs, not five 40watt bulbs.As far as the directions go, they are pretty much useless. There are no steps, just a photo of the parts included. My order did include a very tiny pair of cotton gloves that would not fit my hands to handle the crystal.Even with all of the inaccuracies, this fixture is beautiful and I am keeping it installed.",

Way worth the cost and I have hold absolutely recommend it to anyone. Directions left a little to be desired but if you are at all handy, or have installed a light before, you won't have any problems figuring it out!",
