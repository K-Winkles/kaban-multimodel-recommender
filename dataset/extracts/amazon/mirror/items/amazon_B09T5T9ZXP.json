I have forgotten to remove it and place it in a safe area twice, both time it fell off and scared me (but it hasn't broken yet). I am happy with my purchase and simply need to learn to put it away instead of thinking it will stay put. As I said it hasn't broken even after falling, so I have to say it is very sturdy and a great travel size.I did receive it on time and in great shape. If I do break it I will order it again.",
