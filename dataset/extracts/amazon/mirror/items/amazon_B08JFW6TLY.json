You can either attach to the wall or have it lean on it. I wanted to leave it leaning on the wall so I was pretty happy with how sturdy it is. The mirror doesn\u2019t distort the images and it\u2019s super easy to clean. It\u2019s a bit heavy so not one to be moving around all the time. If you are looking for a fancy-looking oversized mirror but don\u2019t want to spend over 500 on it, this one is for you!",

It had really hard gross dirty spots, like what you see from a dirty bathroom mirror. The mirror itself looks nice especially after I had to Scrub off whatever was on it. But the frame is poorly made. It's like they tried to laminate the wood instead of painting it. You can clearly see where the seems meet and it looks almost like it was dragged around a lot. There's a lot of wear along the edges. Either it was a used product or it was poorly manufactured. If I could return It I would but it doesn't seem to have the option to do so. I wouldn't gamble on this mirror.",
