There are 36 stickers -- enough for nine per mirror. No other hanging options are included.It is recommended to only apply these to smooth surfaces, which makes sense. But my wall has textured paint. I didn't want to sand and repaint, so I took my chances. These mirrors have been hanging there without issue.I think \"bendable\" is a stretch, but these do have give and seem much more flexible than a sheet of glass.
