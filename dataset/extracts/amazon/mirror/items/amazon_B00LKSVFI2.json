                "reviewText": "I recently broke my Grandmother's porcelain dresser size stand mirror while packing for my \"downsize\" move. After having an item so long you don't realize how much you used the item!The older mirror only had a 2x magnification, I am guessing. This 8x's magnification is a must have if you are at that age when reading glasses or permanent glasses are required! I can't believe how much easier it is for me to see my eye makeup application. For years I was not seeing precisely what I was doing. Not being aware of the difference a higher magnification would make for me. I now can see those tiny eyebrow hairs and of course the facial hair I was not aware that I had. Warning: Order your choice of facial hair remover at the same time that you purchase this mirror if you are like me and did not have a high magnification mirror, you will be embarrassed when you see just how many facial hairs that the world has seen in the sunlight you didn't know were there!The price of the mirror when compared to the weight and sturdy construction is amazing. I looked at many, settled on this one, and am pleased that I did.It's pretty in a chrome version, the base is a nice touch. I miss the beauty of the my antique mirror as it was hand painted porcelain, but price wise, it is the perfect replacement.Further, although it is made extremely well, the weight is not too heavy to use the non magnify to hold up and make sure (in my case), my french braid is straight when I am done.It is a size that is just right for me. But in addition to allowing it to sit on the stand for my make up it is the correct size for picking up to view the back of my hair.A good choice, in my opinion.",

Colour, glass quality \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f The only issues I have are : 1) When assembled, there is a gap between the stand and the mirror and 2) The 8x side (the other side is regular) is impossible to use. You have to hold it far away, which negates the purpose. Maybe just use 3 or 4 x, as technically, anything more (pro-ratioed) is superfluous.BUT, I did give it high marks! Get it\u2026",
