            "\u3010Travel Size\u3011- Our handheld mirror has an approximately 5\" diameter viewing area. It is a portable mirror enough to reflect anything: lightweight, easy to carry, and travel-friendly.",
            "\u3010Multi-Purpose Design\u3011- This makeup mirror has an additional hole at the end of the handle to hang the mirror. Or you may hold it by the hand as customarily used. Easy to switch between these two ways, perfect for personal & professional use.",
            "\u3010High-End Hand Mirror with Handle\u3011- This mirror comprises four layers of coating craftsmanship, which will bring you a better reflection experience; the frame is made of thick ABS plastic that will be stronger and more durable yet eco-friendly.",
            "\u3010Random Color Frames\u3011- For this option, you will get one of 4 colors at random (transparent black, blue, pink, or clear). The unique transparent frame makes the mirror looks pretty and sleek. Nice gift for friends and loved ones."

The reflective surface is bright and surprisingly clear in comparison to the older hand mirror it is replacing. Light in weight, easy to use. Gave sturdiness four stars even though I wasn't dissatisfied with the way the mirror handle and frame are constructed, yet it I would use the phrase delicately durable and not sturdy, meaning it's a mirror mounted in a plastic frame with a plastic handle. If the mirror is dropped it might bounce without breaking anything, yet if it hits something hard or angled (tile floor, counter edge, etc.) it might break or crack the mirror.",
