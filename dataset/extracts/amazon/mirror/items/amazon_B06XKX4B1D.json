The door wouldn't handle much weight and this little mirror turned out to be perfect for my needs. It's not a high quality mirror, more like something you could find at a dollar store but the reflection is quite good for the price. Because of Covid 19, I have been cutting my own hair (buzz cut) and this mirror works great as a second mirror for looking at the back of my head.",

I took a few photos of how the mirror was packaged. As you can see, it was carefully wrapped in two layers of bubble wrap then packed in a plastic envelope. Under the bubble wrap, the mirror is shrink wrapped with protective paper board on the corners. Since I just want this mirror for photography lighting, I have not removed the shrink wrap. The reflection is clear and not warped nor distorted. It works well for my purposes.",

It is large enough for baby to get a full view of herself and more. It\u2019s easy to prop up against anything so she can stare at her self while on her tummy. Sometimes she even holds it herself while she\u2019s on her back (with parent supervision) and just stares and smiles. I left the cardboard bumpers on to keep the ends soft for baby and so far they have handled every position and grab! Love it! Great value for something we might not even need for a long time too.",
