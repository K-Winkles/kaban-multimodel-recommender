One side is normal view and the other is magnification.I the pedestal stand puts it at a good height to apply makeup .The brightness is almost Too bright. I always turn it down just a bit.Would definitely recommend this mirror.",

Much brighter and it was easier to attach the mirror to the base! I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend this seller!Not much to say. It's a mirror. It doesn't stay together too well, but the worst part is the complete ack of a bright light. It doesn't matter how long you charge it. It's simply too dark to do anything with.",

It is nicely made, has three different color tones, swivels easily, and magnifies a LOT!If you cannot bear to look at your pores, freckles, dark spots, and wrinkles, this is not for the faint-hearted.BUT, it is such a good magnifier that you can apply your make up perfectly every time. Excellent.I would not try to travel with is as it is so large and would be hard to pack and protect, but I keep it near my dressing table and use it to \"correct\" my makeup, and for that it is amazing.",

However the charge doesn't last long and the way I could tell was that the light got really dim. Otherwise this is a great mirror just be aware of the charging feature. It is nice not to have a cord attached to the mirror and makes it easy to move around. The color of the mirror looks good and the touch screen options work great!",

It is a little scary when I look at 10 times myself, but I will get used to it. The shape of the base is perfect for my house. And, of my whole big order, the mirror and my dog's biscuits came the next day! My only complaint is that I could see more wrinkles on my face than on my other mirror!",
