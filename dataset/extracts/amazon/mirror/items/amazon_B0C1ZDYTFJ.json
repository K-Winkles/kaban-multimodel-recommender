This one is perfect height, heavy, sturdy base and easy to see in. It has a shut off feature so in case you forget to turn it off, it will shut it's self off, which is cool. It comes with a charging cord, but no plug, so that was a minus, but with all the old phone plugs I had, not a pain of having to buy one.",

Flip side is 10x and easy to focus on. Stays lighted for 30 minutes and cuts itself off. For me, that\u2019s a great feature. Easy to charge when needed. Would definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This is the perfect countertop mirror for several reasons. It is height adjustable so I no longer have to put my makeup mirror on a box of Kleenex to get a good angle. It is nicely weighted and looks pretty. The 10x magnification is just what I need for applying makeup, no distortion. The LED light has several temperature settings and starts out exactly where I want it to be saving me from having to cycle through the options. The rechargeable battery keeps my lighted mirror glowing without having to plug it in. This is a winner for me.",

I appreciate that I can simply charge the unit; however, I bought this particular product because of the adjustable base. I am very tall, so the ability to extend the unit was very appealing. Unfortunately, it does not hold well, and the unit will slide down and retract to the base. The illumination is good and the quality of the mirror is good, but the QC of the adjustable base needs work.",
