It was in a plastic bag in a box. The glass fell all over my kitchen island. You would think the mirror would be in bubble wrap to keep it in one piece. Even if it wasn\u2019t broken I would have returned it. It\u2019s not good quality at all. It has the quality of a $10 cheap mirror. Don\u2019t waste your time or money.",
