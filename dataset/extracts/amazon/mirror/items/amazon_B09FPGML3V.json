It doesn\u2019t take up much space on my wall, has a regular and 10X mirror, and has three different light settings. It is nice that the mirror light is rechargeable so I don\u2019t have to keep replacing batteries. It comes with a USB A to USB C charging cord but not a power adapter, so I\u2019ve decided to just use my iPhone charger and cable when I want to charge the light for the mirror.I used a pencil, drill, and hammer to install the mirror. A level was handy too. It wasn\u2019t difficult to install. I found that the Allen bolts at the hinges were a little loose, causing the mirror to sag a slightly.. I tightened them a bit. with a 3mm Allen wrench, and it was perfect.I can\u2019t speak to the longevity of the battery charge or the lifespan of the battery since I\u2019ve only had this product for a short time, but I\u2019m very satisfied with all other aspects so far.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this Vanity Mirror for my wife and she has been really pleased with it. It is a great addition to our vanity area and the lighted feature provides just the right amount of natural-looking light for her to apply her makeup. The design is sleek and modern, and its mirror face can be adjusted to give a precisely angled view as needed.The installation process was easy, though I had to use my own wall anchors as the ones that came with it weren't quite sturdy enough for me. However, the overall assembly went smoothly - once secured in place it was ready to be used! The light provides an even illumination across the entire mirror surface which really helps when doing detailed work like applying eyeliner or contouring. Additionally, there is a USB charger and the option to use batteries if desired.Overall, I'm really happy with this purchase! The quality of craftsmanship is excellent - nothing seems flimsy or cheap - and from what I've seen so far this product should last me for many years down the road. If you're looking for a stylish yet practical makeup vanity mirror then this one is definitely worth considering!",

I am at the stage in life that I need reading glasses (2.5 to read my computer, for example; 3.0 to read a book). The 10x magnification on this mirror is essential to getting my makeup on and getting my contact lenses in. It has been sturdy and no problems. I was asked about the brightness. I don't even bother using that feature. Again, with my vision the way it is, there is no self lighted mirror that would be enough for me. I am happy with this purchase.",
