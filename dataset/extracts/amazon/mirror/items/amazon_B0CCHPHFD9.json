                "reviewText": "This mirror is definitely not a 30x magnifying mirror. It's 10x at best. It is sturdy and a good traveling companion. Tweezers are ok. Quite compact. I purchased it thinking that it would be useful for keeping my eyebrows in check yet, the magnifying mirror is just the same as my old 10x magnifying mirror so I will most likely only use it only for traveling. I was looking to replace the one I had, but, this new one is too small.",
