                "reviewText": "Pros: This mirror feels sturdy. It stays in place when you position it. The surfaces are clear and unblemished. It has a somewhat slip free feel to the surface. - Slightly rubberized.Cons: Because of the way the magnifying side is shaped, it can be hard to find a focus point. Especially if you are trying to look at the side of your face (for example). It has no hole in the base for hanging on the wall, for a hook or screw. The pivot points are on the long sides of the rectangle - so it's more of an up and down view, than a side to side view. ( which I feel takes away from its usefulness ).I bought this as a replacement mirror. The mirror it replaced had a round magnifying side. I find the round preferable due to the even distortion around the sides. The magnification side on this mirror is rectangular, and the distortion is somewhat uneven.Over all not a bad mirror. Decent for the price.",

I've been searching for ages for a freestanding rectangular mirror this size, suitable for the bathroom, but all the others I've ordered ended up being returned because the image wasn't quite true - not a huge distortion but I seem to notice it more than most people, and it was just enough to make my vision swim. This mirror gives a properly stable, clear reflection, and the magnifying side is also very useful for the occasional close up. The soft touch frame looks and feels nice, and the whole thing seems well made. It's a pleasure to use.",
