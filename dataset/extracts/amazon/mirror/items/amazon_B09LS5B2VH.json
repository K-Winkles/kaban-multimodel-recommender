I love that it\u2019s rechargeable and not battery operated. It is well-made, and there are different ways you can position it to use it to the best of your advantage. It comes with a smaller 10 X magnification mirror that attaches to the larger mirror which is perfect for those close times you need it. I do like the little silk carring bag and it\u2019s compact enough to fit perfectly in any suitcase or large purse.It would make a wonderful Christmas gift for anyone age 10 to 100. Love it.",

The three different light settings work well and this thing can get bright! My one concern is the battery goes out at different intervals even when I\u2019ve charged it fully (ie, when the charging light turns off). I\u2019ve had the mirror turn off after 30 min of being on and then after an hour (both at same brightness) so I recommend you bring the charging cable with you. You cannot use the light when it is charging FYI.",

                "reviewText": "The mirror comes with a beautiful soft carrying pouch, a microfiber tissue, and a charging cable. Its casing seems solid and durable. The mirror is bigger than I expected, so that was a nice surprise. The magnifying mirror is also big enough for my purpose and having 3 colors of the light really helps. I have a similar mirror with LED lights that is bigger and more bulky, so I needed something more compact. This one was a great choice. Compared to my other mirror, I kinda wish this one was a tad bit brighter. It's definitely bright enough to do makeup, but I guess I would like to have it blasting in my face even more. Other than that, it seems like a well-made product although the time will tell how long the swivel part will hold up before becoming loose.",

Easy to pack.Cons: Battery charge didn't last as long as I would have expected, probably 5 days with about 10 minutes of use each day so bring the cord. The light is so bright it can cause a lot of glare. You have to get close so the light will actually be on your face. The magnifying mirror is too small to be useful in my opinion.For the price its probably the best you can get.",
