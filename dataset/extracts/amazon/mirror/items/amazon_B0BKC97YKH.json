I suspected that this mirror would work super well for that use case and it does (which is good news because non-mirror but otherwise identical, plain plastic surfaces can cost ten times as much). Removing the mirror from the stand wasn't the easiest thing in the world, but it wasn't too bad either (it maybe took ten seconds and a bit of elbow grease). Anyway, this mirror couldn't work better for me and I'm glad to be so pleasantly surprised by how well it performs.",

The dual sided design is a plus, a magnified side allows for detailed tasks, makes it easy to apply makeup or perform other skin care routine.Both sides offer a crystal clear reflection, free from distortion, gives a true to life image.Maybe not the sturdiest built, but does the job.",

The magnification is enough for him to see his face.It is quite a handy mirror to have around, you can store it in a drawer if it\u2019s not in use or just leave it on the shelf.",
