                "reviewText": "I was worried when I saw all the reviews about the mirror coming in shattered, but I went ahead and ordered it anyways\u2026 and it's all in one piece! It was packaged up very well, lots of layers of cardboard and bubblewrap. Not even a scratch on it.It's very light, and I love how it comes with the stand so that you can have the option to have it free standing on its own, against a wall, or hung up. It would do fine hung up if you really wanted it, I think, since it's so light.Can't beat the price for the item. It's very tall (for me, anyways), easy to position where you want, and seems to be fairly sturdy for what it is. Just obviously don't go kicking things, I guess. Other mirrors were at least twice this price, I'm so happy I got this mirror.",

I bought the white frame, and the result is a more blended look than the black frame, which accentuates the outline of the mirror. For this size of a mirror, you can't beat the price. For this much quality and ease of assembly, I am grateful!",

Apparently, I NEED to return it in order to get a full refund, despite it being such an expensive product. Furthermore, I am a small person in comparison to the size of the box and a student who lives alone downtown. I would have to pay extra to get this package out of my home. SO NOT WORTH IT!
