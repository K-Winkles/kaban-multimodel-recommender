I complained and asked for a replacement. Amazon did replace it, but 2nd mirror is more scratched than the first one. It is apparent that they do not get the plastic covering immediately, and they become scratched at some point in storage, prior to the plastic protective cover being put on. So brand new but still scratched all to heck.**Ironically, the brand new unused \"fog free\" mirror is foggy just in its default reflection. So the mirror is foggy/dim prior to even using it.**Once used you will discover mirror is not fog free by any stretch of the imagination. It does not repel fog any more than a normal mirror. The only plus is that it is made for the shower, so you have a handy hanger to latch it on to. Overall, not really an improvement from using a regular mirror, other than the adhesive hanger/hook.",
