                "reviewText": "Decided to upgrade my bathroom with a new light fixture & replace the mounted medicine cabinet with a mirror. Great value for the cost! Came packaged with tons of protection, so luckily nothing was broken or bent.The installation was simple with a trick I learned over the years - put a piece of painters tape across the back & mark where the center of the screw mounts are & then transfer to the wall to make your marks!I installed this on a plaster wall, so instead of using the wall anchors & mounting screws included I used 1 1/4\u201d drywall screws & it\u2019s been holding fine for almost 24 hours!At only 9lbs it\u2019s not extremely difficult to install with one person. The only difficult part was not really being able to feel when the screws were in the mounting holes on the back, but it hasn\u2019t budged!I\u2019d say it\u2019s maybe a little expensive for a mirror, but the quality is nice & it doesn\u2019t seem cheap - just a $35 price range seems more appropriate in my opinion.Buy it!
