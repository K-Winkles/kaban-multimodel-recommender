I had never tried a pointed tweezer, but it is much easier that the flat or pointed head ones I have used for years, at least true of plucking chin hairs. This task has become necessary every 1-2 days, and a 20% magnifier mirror of good quality has made it easy without reading glasses and faster plucking with improved implement. Work great on eyebrows, too. We\u2019ll worth the price.",
