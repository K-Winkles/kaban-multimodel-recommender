                "reviewText": "This is a great little light up magnifying mirror that actually fits in my purse. It can be so frustrating to be out needing to fix your makeup or see that little thing that's been in your eye and bugging you and not have a decent mirror to do so.Having a mirror with a the 10X magnifyer is a life saver for a person with aging eyes. Plus, the lights in this mirror can be made brighter or dimer to match the surroundings, so you never end up looking over or under made up. The lights also have a \"memory\", so before you leave the house, you can set the mirror for the lighting level, returning to that same lighting level for touch ups. It also has an automatic shut off, so I don't have to be concerned that I lost all the charge for my lights by forgetting to turn off the lights. The little mirror comes with its own bag, so it will be safe in my purse.The mirror comes with a fully illustrated set of instructions so you don't need to guess what everything does.This little mirror would also be a handy addition to your makeup/overnight bag. You will always have proper lighting to do your makeup with this mirror.I chose the color \"Light Pink-3.9in\", and I really love the color.This mirror would make a thoughtful gift for anyone who would have a need to be able to see their face well for makeup applications, contact lens insertion and extraction, or anything of the sort.",

                "reviewText": "These travel mirrors are awesome, I have never had mirrors like them before. I liked them so much that I got one for my mom and sister as well, and they thought it was super cool and instantly fell in love when I turned the LEDs on. I got this mirror in black and the color looks great, the finish is flawless.There is a normal mirror at the bottom, and a 10x magnification zoom mirror up top that will show you all of the details of your face. You might be shocked by what you see on the 10x mirror lol, but unless someone else has a microscope or telescope, they won't be seeing it too so don't worry.While the 10x magnification mirror is a unique and welcome addition, the stand-out feature of this mirror is the bright LED lights that surround both mirrors. There is a cool touch sensitive surface on the bottom mirror, marked by a white circle. If you swipe your finger on the mirror, the leds come on at full brightness and turn cool white (blueish tone). Swipe again, and they turn warm (more orange/yellow). Swipe a third time, and both the cool blue and warm orange lights turn on at the same time. Hold your finger on the surface, and the lights will begin to dim. swipe the button surface a final fourth time, and the lights turn off. Its worth noting that if you leave the lights on and close the mirror, the lights will automatically turn off so the battery doesn't die, which is a nice attention to detail feature (I have another mirror from a different brand that doesn't do that).It charged via USB-C and includes a charging wire. I fully recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I found this compact to be convenient for applying makeup away from home. It has 2 mirrors, one with 190x magnification and the lights have 3 light options.A design flaw IMHO is that the magnification should be on the lower side of the compact. I don't always need to use that one right away or sometimes at all so that was disruptive to my vision at first glance since it's the first thing you see when you open it.Also, keep in mind that although the lights are adjustable, in dark settings, the light emanating can be overbearing for your eyes and can actually make it more difficult to use the mirror.The light pink color is feminine but not childish-lookingThe battery lasts a long time.Otherwise, it's been a nice addition to my away from home makeup bag or just loose in my purse when needed.",

                "reviewText": "Gospire 3.9\" Rechargeable Travel Makeup Mirror with Lights and Magnification 10X, 3 Light Colors & Adjustable Brightness, Magnetic Closure & Memory Function, LED Compact Mirror for Purse - Purple PinkI didn't know how much I needed these little mirrors until I got them. I am often putting my makeup on somewhere other than at my vanity table, so it's hard to find the right lighting if I'm sitting on the couch or at the kitchen table or wherever. Sometimes I'm doing a touch up in the car. I didn't realize how much I was struggling with it until on a whim I ordered these mirrors. I got one for my purse and one for my house. It's very easy to control with just a touch and gives different lighting options for different purposes.Sometimes I want it super bright just so as I can see every detail, and other times I want to know what an eyeshadow will look like in more natural light or candlelight surroundings. You can adjust the brightness as well, again just by touching the bottom part of the mirror. I haven't had to recharge it yet, though I've used it for a while now, so I know a charge holds long enough for it not to be an imposition to recharge it.It's a terrific mirror and I wholeheartedly recommend it. I think it would make a nice gift too.",
