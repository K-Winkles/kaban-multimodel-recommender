                "reviewText": "There isn't much I can add to the thousands of reviews that have already been posted but here are some of the things that concerned me and my take on them.Build quality:Some have said that this is poorly made and that the foot holders are flimsy and the straps that hold your foot on are not enough or in the wrong place.My take: The build quality is excellent. All the screws and parts fit perfect for assembly. The steel is thick and sturdy. The paint did chip where I tightened one of the screws so understand this is painted steel not powder coated steel.The foot holders are solid plastic and there is a thick strap that goes across the top of the foot. Maybe they upgraded this after complaints. I have a size 7 foot and the strap fits where it should across the top of my foot. You should wear shoes while working out and use good form.Computer:Some reviews note this does not work or work as expectedMy take: It works perfectly. I can set it to display only reps, or only time or only.... This is a very rudimentary computer that work by hitting a button each time the seat slides. I use it for reps only as that is spot on. For calories I have smart watch that tracks my fitness.Hydraulics:Some note that there is no difference in resistence from #1 to #12.My take: There is resistence from #1 to #12. Is #1 super easy, kind of. After several reps you do feel it. Is #12 super hard to pull, no. There is a change of resistence but if you are looking for a professional grade pull this is not it. If you understand that reps and form are important this is good enough. It's probably best to use this as a warm-up or cool-down machine and not your total daily workout.Seat comfort:Some say this is not comfortable.My take: It is hard plastic but I'm not on it long enough for it to be uncomfortable, so I give it a thumbs up.Other take-aways:SUPER EASY TO ASSEMBLE! Honestly, an 8 year old could assemble this. The parts are clearly marked and the hardware pack is clearly labeled. I was very impressed with the simplicity.Weight: It weighs 35lbs! Easy to move with one person. You might need 2 persons to get it up or down stairs only because of the handles make it awkward as they move.I like the option for using full motion with the oars.All in all I am VERY please with this home rowing machine. Maybe I got a well made machine or maybe Sunny Health and Fitness took consumer gripes to heart and made changes. For $121 I thought I got a good buy but now I see it for $114 so it's a real steal now!",

                "reviewText": "Price, Delivery, Unboxing and AssemblyOn July 5, 2023, I purchased the Sunny Health & Fitness SF-RW5639 Full Motion Rowing Machine w/350 lb. Weight Capacity and LCD Monitor, Silver. 1K bought within that past month and Amazon's Choice. Overall rating 4.4 from 6,000 customer reviews. Why not?It was hard to overlook a rowing machine for $125. Surprisingly, it arrived within a few days, in one, manageable, big box.I couldn't ask for an easier assembly. With a flawless, descriptive user manual, my 19-year-old niece assembled it in 20 minutes or less. My first week rowing experienceThe first 3 days were smooth sailing, I rowed 45 minutes each day. I became concerned because the scale would fluctuate between 1-3 lbs. each day I weighed in.By day 4, I spruced up the minutes to 60 because I liked certain features I was beginning to notice. I noticed though that I wasn't burning as many calories as I burned with my elliptical, but my jeans were still falling off my waist.By day 5, I noticed a significant change in my facial components and a slimmer side profile as I looked in the mirror. This is when I believed that this exercise machine was destined to help me achieve my health goals. I also conducted a few searches in quest to discover why my scale was stagnant even though it was evident that I was losing weight. I came across a few videos which explained that my body was burning fat while building muscles, a process called Body Recomposition. I checked off all the signs: 1. Gaining weight 2. Clothes fitting indifferently 3. Building strength 5. Body composition is changing.The only thing I couldn't check off was 4. Getting bulky per Trifectanutrition.comBy day 6, I was sore and became concerned about continuing to row or taking a break. So, I took a day off from rowing and decided to do a moderate paced walk in my neighborhood. I did a few stretches, which I think I'm horrible at, but hey. I increased my water intake from 4 cups to 8 cups, to make sure my body isn't dehydrated.By day 7, I'm still mentally gearing up to continue rowing today, while I watch the new episode of one of my favorite reality tv shows. My biggest fear is that I'll be in too much pain to complete an hour of rowing.Pros and ConsOne of my favorite things about the rower is that I can drag it anywhere, unlike the $800 elliptical my older brother gifted me some years ago. It's just easy. Switching from indoor to outdoor is a mood changer as well. So, if you're looking for mobility in a rowing machine, this little frugal machine is your guy.I dislike the fewer calories the monitor displays. It seems to burn only a fraction of calories of what the elliptical burns, which I use for only 30 minutes. So, in 60 minutes or the rower I'll burn about 200 calories. In 30 minutes of the elliptical I'll burn 300 calories. However, with the rower, the progress is slower, I guess, but the results are worthwhile, because I'm toning while burning fat. I keep this in mind each time I weigh myself on the scale.Final ratingsI've been on my failed weight loss journey for 17 years and I've tried a few machines. I'm rating this rower 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!",

                "reviewText": "The good news is: I estimate a 500 calorie burn just for assembling. The hardest part was fitting the rowing arms into the machine, due to the awkward angle you must position yourself in, to fit the arms into the proper holes. These arms are not light, and you'll need LOTS of space around the unit in order to get \"just the right angle.\"1 person assembly (me)Total time: 1 hour 10 min (from opening box to finishing assembly:). And this includes a break to go and find my yoga mat to place under the unit for wood floor protection, once I got finally retrieved the main part of the unit out of the box. See breakdown below:15 Minutes: cutting all the tape off each part, and unwrapping20 Minutes: assembling the front \"base\" and the back \"base\" (then I turned it over, as I realized I had it bottom side up)35 Minutes: assembling the pedals, timer unit, two arms, and \"placing\" the seat onto the machine. This took me at least 5 minutes to figure out, as the instructions just said \"insert\" the seat onto the unit. What it really meant was \"fit the seat onto the unit, and it will slide back and forth, requires no assembly or screws.\"I predict that 2 people could set this up in 15-20 minutes.Literally, there are only 8 pieces to assemble, and this includes the timer unit, which just slides into a groove and plugs in.I got on the machine and tried it out right away (of course!!) and it works REALLY WELL! I was initially disappointed, as it seemed too easy , so I figured I'll just have to do dozens of reps to get a workout or tone up. THEN, I read the instructions (fully) and realized that the main \"base arm\" (I'll call it) that is angled underneath actually has a rotating cup (like a dial) that includes 12 SETTINGS FOR RESISTANCE! So, I turned it from 1 to 4, and the #4 setting was much more difficult. I dared not try any harder settings as it's been way too long since I've used a rowing machine (about 1.5 yrs).It's definitely more of a workout than kayaking.This unit is so basic, which is why I love it so much. For the price, it's definitely worth it, too. And no bells and whistles means \"less can go wrong.\" I'm more into body weight resistance these days, vs. spending hundreds or $1000+ on machines that include apps (what happens when your internet is wonky??) and bells and whistles.I own a watch that includes a \"paddling\" measuring tool, so I wasn't that concerned with the digital unit. It requires 2 AAA batteries, which you see from the pic are included -- a $5 savings right there!I include pics of the instructions for those who are curious before purchasing. Enjoy!",

It's a really sturdy build, doesn't feel flimsy or likely to break, and has a nice big comfy seat and good size foot rests. In terms of its use, the little computer it comes with is extremely basic. You can count your strokes and the time you've been on the machine, but it doesn't have a timer, and you have to calculate the SPM yourself. It has 12 adjustable levels, but even as a beginner, anything under 7 doesn't give a great workout, so that's a bit limiting. The hydraulics heat up pretty fast, so it's advisable to stop after about 20 minutes and leave it to cool. This can be a bit annoying if you're just getting into it and want to carry on - but you can also do a decent workout either in bursts of twenty minutes, with gaps, or just doing sprints for 20 minutes. Its really quiet, you can listen to music or even watch TV while using it without any problem, and the arms fold in making it easy to store. The leg space is good - I'm 5'7\" and have loads of space, it would definitely accommodate someone much taller without any issues. Overall, despite its limits, its a really great machine for the price, and I'm extremely happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "Ya llevo casi 2 meses con esta maquina. La compre sobre todo para mantenwer las articulaciones elasticas pues con ella se mueve todo el cuerpo(no para adquirir fuerza). Cuando la recibi, la tuve sin armar por 3 dias pues me parecia muy tediosa(un mes antes compre una VIDAXL, la cual viene casi lista,pero es bastante rustica y el asiento casi a ras con el suelo). Finalmente saque valor y la arme, mirando primero los tornillos que bien en una cajita transparente y fijandome en las fotos de la maquina presente en esta pagina web.Como critica, diria que el fabricante deberia hacer un manual de operaciones mas sencillo y practico, ni siquiera hay una fotografia de la maquina). La utilizo diariamente por espacion de media hora mientras veo tv o internet. Estoy contento con ella y tiene muy buen precio, por eso su demanda(se tardo 1 mes en llegar).",
