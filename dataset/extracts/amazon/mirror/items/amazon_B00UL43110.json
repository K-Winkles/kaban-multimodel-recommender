It was packaged extremely well with no damage upon arrival. There are no tools needed...just unfold the hanger and go. There are three different levels in which to find your best option. I can't say enough about this. If you have narrow closet doors, this is the mirror for you. I ended up using a 3M command strip on the bottom to keep it from bouncing/banging each time the door is opened and closed. It works perfect and won't ruin the door finish. Great find...thanks again, Amazon!",

                "reviewText": "Have had major interior renovations done inside my home which has included new doors. Didn\u2019t want a mirror drilled into a new door. So, I found this hanging one. Honestly, it does what it\u2019s supposed to do, but I still can\u2019t help feeling disappointed. It\u2019s not super well made... not for the $45+ price tag. Box came in partially open and damaged. Thank god the mirror wasn\u2019t. Still seems like I may need to reinforce it with some glue around the wooden frame to make sure it holds together. The mirror itself was packaged well but all the other parts and pieces (over the door hanger metal pieces and screws) were all randomly loose in the box. It seemed like something someone bought and returned. I\u2019m currently in a quarantine area and I live with and take care of a parent with a debilitating disease and with an autoimmune issue. So going to Walmart wasn\u2019t an option. I\u2019m going to go ahead and keep the mirror as returning would be more of a pain at the moment with what all is going on. My advice is if you can buy a cheap $10-$20 long mirror that they sell from Walmart- then get one of those and either attach to the back of your door or super/hot glue some hinges to the back if you want an over-the-door hanging mirror.This wasn\u2019t worth the money overall and you can get/make something nicer that\u2019s sturdier for less $$. Save yourself $30. Order or get a mirror from Walmart or from somewhere else.",

It also has the brackets already attached on the back so it is very easy to connect the two over the door hangers. This mirror looks classy and serves us well. We did put some Removable Mounting Putty behind the frame at the bottom so it would not move when opening and closing the door. We are very happy with the purchase.",

The box this item came in (which was a brown shipping box, looks nothing like the box pictured) says in rather large letters: Made in Colombia. I purchased this mirror over other options because I thought I was supporting an American made product. I didn\u2019t intend to support Columbia! The mirror itself is OK. It was difficult to get it to sit level over the door. I paid about $45.00 for this item. It is now selling for $70.00. Worth it at $45.00\u2026not worth it at $70.00.",
