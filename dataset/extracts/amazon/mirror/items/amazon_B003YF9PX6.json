        "description": "Product Description In Mirrors 2, the grisly slaughters continue after a young woman is brutally murdered in front of a mirror that is a portal to the world of the undead. Embarking on a murderous rampage, one by one she stalks the men and women responsible for her horrific death, exacting bloody revenge by dismembering and eviscerating the guilty. They can't run, they can't hide and they can't look in the mirror because inside the mirrors the dead live on...waiting for vengeance. Amazon.com While not a direct follow-up to the 2008 shocker Mirrors, Mirrors 2 does indeed boast its share of evil, murderous mirrors. The kind that, when you stare into them, show you an image of yourself doing bloody deeds like chewing broken glass or committing a ritual disemboweling. Not pleasant, especially when the damage manifests itself for real. Said mirrors also add to the misery of an already wretched security guard, Max (Nick Stahl), who finds himself cursed with the ability to foresee these deadly encounters, which happen to his fellow employees at a new department store complex. Max is already having a tough time because his memories of a fatal car accident are a constant nightmare; that might explain why he looks so awful, and why the best he can do is a security guard job when his father (William Katt) actually owns the whole new development. Horror fans will not find much beyond this setup, as Max occasionally visits his shrink and sort of becomes a suspect in the rash of killings. The cast includes Christy Carlson Romano as an early victim and Emmanuelle Vaugier as the sister of a missing woman, but most of the movie is spent waiting around for the grotesque attacks--which do nothing to disrupt the overall tedium that prevails. --Robert Horton",

The quality is quite good so if your wondering if its a good transfer then it is, you also get a double sided dvd along with the bluray the double sided dvd has the original korean movie on it on the flipside of it. The Audio is 5.1DTS on the bluray so the sound is pretty decent. so its good as an addition to the original otherwise if you havnt seen the 2008 film mirrors starring kiefer sutherland I suggest you watch that first..",

                "reviewText": "This is a very weak sequel. I wouldn't even call it a sequel, it's just trash. First movie was atmospheric, had original and interesting storyline, suspense. This one is completely unoriginal, has nothing to do with the first movie (except for the store name and...mirror? very weak connection, considering all the store mirrors were destroyed in the first part, soo..) There's way too much gore, acting is beyond terrible. Don't watch it.",
