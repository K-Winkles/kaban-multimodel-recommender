                "reviewText": "I just moved into my new home, which was a new build, and while I love my home, the lighting and the setup in the bathrooms aren't 100% to my liking. The mirrors are too far away from the sink and the lighting is a bit dim. This mirror is a lifesaver and solved my problems! It lets me get close to see my skin and my pores and examine my eyebrows for tweezing and any problem areas on my skin that need to be addressed.The larger portion of the mirror itself is great. It has three lighting settings, so you can decide which lighting scheme (soft glow, bright glow, etc.) works best for you. It's very easy to toggle between the three settings with just a button tap which is right on the unit. The smaller, magnifying mirror that suctions to the main mirror really magnifies the areas you want to see. You can really see up close to get those few pesky stray eyebrows plucked or to do a nice liner of the eye if you'd like. And the suction is very strong and stable. It doesn't fall off the mirror at all.The mirror came in a cute little drawstring bag and the mirror folds up flat, so it's neat and tidy. Everything (the mirror, the suctioned magnifying mirror, and the charging cable) fits in the bag so you can take the whole thing with you when you travel. You can easily carry it in a backpack if you'd like, or a purse if the purse is large enough. The mirror comes with a charging cable (no charging unit itself, but I just plugged it into an empty computer port or you can use a phone charger) and it charged extremely fast. The battery life is also great. I don't think I'll have to charge this mirror for a long time.If you're looking for a lightweight and portable, yet powerful, lighted vanity mirror, you won't go wrong with this one. The first time I used it, my husband said, \"Um, can you order me one of those for my bathroom, too?\" so I guess I'll be purchasing a second one. I'll probably get one for my mother for Christmas, too. She loves to sit on her bed and do her makeup, so this will be a miracle for her!",

It was a little smaller than I thought but it still gets the job done :) IIt all comes in a handy bag so you can keep the charging cord with it. I recommend this highly!",
