                "reviewText": "EDIT:The light works, my outlet was just having issues that I did not realize. The mirror is decent and the light works, and I like the stand. After using it more, my primary concern is that the length of the chord is relatively short, which can make placement difficult. It only works when plugged in.Original (was 3 stars):Overall the mirror seems to have decent quality, but was a disappointment because the light does not work. I fully charged it, but the light will not turn on.",

It\u2019s bright, and you can tilt it up and down. You can either use 4 aaa batteries or plug it in. This mirror is sleek and will match any decor. Definitely a 1000/10 will recommend",
