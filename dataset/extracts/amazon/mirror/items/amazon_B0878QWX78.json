They did not disappoint!. The mirrors are true to size and I can see reflections clearly. I did notice some peoples reviews mentioned warping, but I took advice to put a small space in between each and it worked perfectly, no warping. They are also easy to install, although I used two sided mounting tape that I already had, they come with adhesive pieces. Easy to clean (I just used an ordinary dry towel). All in all im happy with my purchase and I would highly recommend these mirrors.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a high school student at a boarding school and I didn't have a full-length mirror to look at my bomb outfits with, so I did a lil online shopping and came across this (mainly cuz it was the cheapest option I could find and we rly do be living the broke life T-T). I looked at a lot of the reviews and saw that some ppl were iffy on the stickies that were provided to stick the mirror onto walls, but I went ahead with the purchase anyway and I don't regret it. Istg if I spent any more than $30 on a full-length mirror my parents would put me in a coffin, but I didn't, so I got away with this purchase with a light scolding (just some context, I didn't tell my parents I was buying this but I got my own card so ahaha). A bunch of the other mirrors I saw were hella expensive, like who wants to spend over $90 on a mirror?? Not me. This arrived pretty quickly and nothing was broken so that's good. I was so excited when I got this package cuz no one sends me anything :( but that's beside the point. I was a little nervous about sticking this on my dorm room walls because my walls are like the textured bumpy ones with little dents and stuff, like the wall isn't smooth. But I put the little stickies in a 3 by 3 pattern (I hope that makes sense??) and then I js stuck it on my wall. I made sure to press extra hard on the areas where the stickies were just in case the mirrors fell but the mirrors haven't fallen so the stickies seem to be working pretty well. There were some scratches on the mirror itself, but they're rly rly faint and small, I could only see them if I put my face really close to the mirror. But at that point, my face was too close to the mirror and I saw all my pores and stuff and I got grossed out and back away. Overall, I give these mirrors a 10/10!! If you're a broke high school student like me (or a human that doesn't want to spend a lot of money on expensive mirrors), this is a great option :D",

                "reviewText": "I ordered these for my mini home gym, specifically for monitoring form, and these were awful for that purpose. My overall image was completely distorted from mirror to mirror, and I\u2019ve learned that any split in mirror, but especially lower quality mirrors will completely distort the overall look. Individually, these could pass for say a quick makeup touch up or hair adjustment, even a general accent on a wall they\u2019d be great, but for a full body need in a workout room, even fitted right together, is a big fat no. So for accent or display and not full and continuous use these would work fine. I can\u2019t even return them though because once I measured and got them all up and perfect, only then realizing how awful they were all together, it took a flat scraper to gently lift each piece from the wall with the included double sided adhesives, and they all broke in some place. Cracked into a ton of pieces and damaged the wall in some areas. Useless mess and a waste of money. If you\u2019re unsure about these, use one small piece of the double sided tape and put them all up before committing to the full adhesive.",
