                "reviewText": "Everything works, the lights, mirror magnification, the tray to hold items is helpful. My biggest issue is that you can't prop it open to see the 10x side at an angle that is helpful without it falling over. The bar does not have much bend flexibility or a way to lock it in place so as soon as you tilt the mirror up slightly, it's too imbalance from being top heavy and falls over or doesn't have the flexion needed. A weighted bottom and hinges that open more would have helped alot.",
