                "reviewText": "I am so happy to have found the perfect travel mirror!I can not tell you how many inferior mirrors I have purchased in the past just to find out they're so distorted, except maybe the inner inch or so in which I could kinda see my eye. As time has gone on I needed to get a stronger and stronger mirror and when you get to a 15x it gets nearly impossible to get a clear travel mirror.This mirror is super clear, no distortion, and the viewing area is large. I can actually put on my makeup in it. Follow their directions to start at the distance away, and move out, it really helps to see if it is a clear view for you.The suction cups are really strong. I kinda felt I needed to hold it on the mirror the first use because I was afraid it would fall. Nope! I had to pry it off the mirror because of the suction is super strong.In the past I was toting my big plug in mirror all over the map just to put on makeup. It was taking up so much space in my suitcase, but I was desperate. NO MORE! This takes up so little space, it's light, and works like a charm. More space for my clothes, etc... now! I won't leave home with out it in my travels!!Now I only have to remember to remove it from the hotel mirror before checking out, I wish there was an alarm on this baby so I wouldn't forget it. I'm thinking of ordering another one just in case I do forget it.When you find something you love, it's nice to have a back up.I can totally recommend the purchase of this, and no, no one gave me a thing for this review.",

I wasn\u2019t a fan at first but wow, once I saw all the things my flat 15x mirror was missing, I now wouldn\u2019t be without this! Amazing for tweezing brows. The suction cups are strong and work well.",

It also reflects light in an annoying sort of way. The image that I see is not very sharp or precise. It works well enough to do my eye makeup, but it's next to useless for tweezing small hairs because the way it reflects light makes any little hairs practically invisible somehow. The suction cups work ok though. It did fall down once or twice, but it didn't break.",
