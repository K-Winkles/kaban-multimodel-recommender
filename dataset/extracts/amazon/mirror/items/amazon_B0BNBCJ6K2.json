I prefer to keep the mirror and tweezers in my drawer. When I use them to tweeze my eyebrows, I will hold the mirror in my hand. It\u2019s also the perfect size to take when traveling so I can keep my eyebrows \u201csalon fresh.\u201dI\u2019m happy to have purchased these products.

You have to pretty much hold it 1-2 inches from your eye to get it in focus. I was hoping to use this to shave because of the small size, but could barely maneuver it around my face before it would lose focus. I could only imagine how hard it would be to use the 20x one. In retrospect to my purchase, the mirror probably works great if you need it for eye makeup, or an eyelash in your eye lid, not so much for anything else.",

I opted for a cheaper version thinking all magnified mirrors would match the same quality. I ordered two. Both mirrors arrived as expected but the quality was far from expectation. Both delivered a distorted reflection thereby rendering them useless. It was impossible to obtain a clear view without distortion. Not a happy customer and have requested a refund.",
