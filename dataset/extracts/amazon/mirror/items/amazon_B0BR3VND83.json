                "reviewText": "Pros:I gave this mirror 5-stars because it did the job very well and appears to be well-designed and well-constructed. I've only used it 2 weeks, but so far, no issues at all. Good size mirror surface. Clarity on both sides. Lighting options work great and look great. I experienced no distortion on the 10x side of mirror, which was a relief because I've done \"mirror research\" and some reviewers of similar-type MAG mirrors complained of distortion. The mirror looks nice and somehow manages being substantial in size but not clunky. The design is classic and modern at the same time. Sturdy. I haven't needed to recharge it yet, so I can't speak on that!Cons:This really isn't an actual \"con\" toward this mirror, but I wanted a little more magnification. Even though I understood it was 10x I was hoping for more \"pop\". My eyesight would have preferred more , but actually I could still see everything I needed to see. Lighting could have been a tad brighter - but I'm sure lighting is a subjective experience. Note to manufacturer: could you please make a mirror just like this - but with a higher magnification? (Of course, sometimes it's scary to see \"things\" that close, but I figure it's better I see it and not someone else! lol)",

                "reviewText": "I'm so happy with my purchase of this lighted magnifying makeup mirror. I had been browsing a ton of different models from different sellers, trying to figure out what I wanted, and this mirror is it.First, I like the location of the charging port and style of charger - it doesn't detract from the design of the mirror at all, and it doesn't seem likely to get easily damaged. When charging, there is a red glow from within the light casing of the mirror, and it turns green when fully charged. I also love that this mirror is rechargeable - it's so light and easy to move around and it's nice that I don't have to be tethered to a power outlet all the time.Second, it's got two different levels of magnification which was the main reason I bought the mirror. The highly magnified side is great for plucking difficult hairs or correcting makeup, and the slightly magnified side helps me make sure I'm applying my makeup smoothly. The swiveling mirror head makes it easy to swap between the two sides.Third, it has 3 different colors of lighting which are very useful to counteract my terrible bathroom lighting, and help show me what my makeup will look like in different lighting. No surprises when I go outside into the sunlight!Finally, I've used it every day since I got it, for a little over an hour at a time. So far, I've had no problems with it. It doesn't heat up around the light, mirror, or base when in use (at least for an hour) so I have no problems handling it or putting it away after use. It comes with a nice little cloth for wiping smudges or fingerprints off of the mirror, which I think is a really nice inclusion - you'd hate to scratch your brand new mirror with a rough cloth. This mirror is perfect for daily home use and I'm very happy with my purchase!",

I like the size, the lighting with the 3 different settings the choice of normal magnification on one side and higher magnification on the other side and the convenience of the rechargeable battery, which keeps a long charge. Also, I needed assistance with the charger and the seller responded quickly and provided excellent customer service. I'm very happy with this product and seller!",

                "reviewText": "5/24/23 UPDATE:I wrote the manufacturer again on 3/26/23 and warned them that I if I didn't get a response, I would report them to Amazon for shady business practices, regarding the mirror that died within their stated 18-month warranty period. Mind you, I had already spoken with Amazon about this once already as well and they were trying to get the manufacturer to respond to me (to no avail). My final warning got them to finally respond that they would replace the mirror. At that time I had asked for tracking information to be sent to me when they had it. Crickets again. I had to write another time to get the tracking information sent. The replacement mirror did finally arrive. So they did finally make it right. I'm not increasing the stars rating though, it took far too much effort on my part to get them to honor their warranties. Do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere. This company will not be getting anymore of my money, that is for sure!2/14/23 UPDATE:Loved at first, now Keeps turning itself on at random times!!!January 2023 marks the one year point of owning this makeup mirror and I have loved it. Until the last couple of weeks. I'm typing this review on 2/14/2023 and as of the last couple of weeks, this make-up mirror has all of a sudden started turning itself on at random times. And those random times seem to mostly be at night! Talk about annoying. And no, apparently there is not an 18 month guarantee or warranty as I'm being completely ignored. I wrote on 2/9 and have heard nothing.Let's start with the good. I loved that it was rechargeable as I didn't have to have a cord in the way when I was using it. I use this in the bathroom when I get ready everyday (or night), so a cord outstretched is not ideal. And the battery charge lasts quite a long time... seems likes weeks before I have to even think about recharging it (and I only do that that it doesn't die on me all of a sudden, not because it has died).One side of the mirror is normal and the other is 10x magnification. Both sides are illuminated, which is fantastic. The light itself is dimmable and the light temperature can be changed from warm to mix to cool. Super useful to your likes.The base is weighted, and correctly so. I've never had an issue with knocking it over and yet, it's not crazy heavy or difficult to move around.The nitpicking points:- The mirror itself is a decent size, I do wish it was a little larger.- It's a usb charging cable, that doesn't not come with an adapter. Not sure how many people are actually using this type of mirror with their computer... I'm not. Just give me a normal plug, so I can plug it into a wall outlet without hunting for an adapter please (or give me the adapter).- The base has a tendency to unscrew from the stand. So I have to keep screwing it back in every so often.The Bad:- As already mentioned, it has all of a sudden started turning itself on at random times. Not sure why. I'll wake up in the middle of the night and it's on full brightness. So I will turn it off. Then in the morning... it's on again! What?! And then in the afternoon... it's on again. Annoying. Talk about battery drain.So now, I'm letting the battery drain and looking for a new one. I'm afraid to charge this thing again that there is some sort of short in it.Stay away from this. Clearly it's only good for a year and the warranty is a complete farce because it's complete crickets if you ask about that.",
