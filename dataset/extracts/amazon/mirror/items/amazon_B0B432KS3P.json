                "reviewText": "Smoke and Mirrors: The Story of Tom Savini (2015). Before I say anything, it's important to lay all my cards on the table. I have had two experiences with Tom Savini, one in 1993, the other in 2004. In each instance, he totally ignored me as I was purchasing an item from his table and getting it signed, in both instances I was simply trying to say something complimentary and move on. But his eye contact and attention were completely on the ladies both times. Now, I'm not some entitled horror fan who believes that I deserve the full attention of an individual for excessive amounts of time. But I do believe it is the grass roots nature of horror that makes it a unique and special community, one where our celebrities, can interact with our fans. Ten seconds of engagement while you write your name in the book I just gave you 25 dollars for is all I ask. This sort of behavior from Mr. Savini has been experienced by many others, as well as kind engagement, so, I know he aint all one thing. Additionally, I've never let these two experiences sour my awareness and appreciation of Savini's genius. He is one of the great FX artists in film...ever. Even if he's been a jerk to me twice. Smoke and Mirrors was an excellent way to at least mitigate some of my feelings, as it really dives deep into Tom's personal life, his experiences and trauma in Vietnam, his relationship with his parents, his siblings, but most especially, his daughters. This latter point really touched me, and I never realized how much Tom gave up in order to be a parent, especially when he received full custody of one of his daughters in the late nineties. Yeah, he might be a loud-mouthed Lothario, but he's also, apparently, a really good dad, a really good parent. He talks a lot about Vietnam and what that did to him, really digging into the ways he came back an emotionally withdrawn shell of a person. Smoke and Mirrors was a really personal exploration of Savini's genius, and it really deepened my impressions of him, and took me a little deeper than what I already knew, what I already thought I knew. Of course there's lots of interviews with folks like Robert Rodriguez, Alice Cooper, Greg Nicotero, Tony Todd, Caroline Williams, and others, but the ones I like best were comments from his daughters. Also features a lot of his best gags from his Romero films, from Maniac, from Prowler, The Burning, and others. Smoke and Mirrors peels back the Grande Illusion just a bit, so we get to see the person, not just the magician.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A great documentary about a great horror legend",
                "reviewText": "Wonderful documentary from Jason Baker tells the story of a true legend in the film industry, renown especially for his contributions to the horror genre, Tom Savini. The film tells the story of Savini growing up in a modest income family in Pittsburg and being influenced by his older brothers and his sister. It details his going to horror movies with his mother, seeing The Man With A 1,000 Faces and deciding from there he wanted to be a part of show business and started doing make-up FX and magic as a kid. It takes us to his harrowing time in Viet Nam and his discovery of a love of acting in theater upon his return home. We are told of his first collaboration with George Romero on Martin and then finally the fateful call from Romero to do the make-up FX for the classic Dawn of the Dead. From there we watch his career unfold as an actor, director, one of the greatest make-up FX creators of all time and a legendary genre personality. In between we get a lot of personal details about his life outside the movies and it builds a strong picture of the man behind the make-up.Baker wisely tells the story from the words of the man himself, supporting Savini\u2019s intimate details of his life and work with extensive photos and video from the legend\u2019s personal life, along with behind the scenes and deleted scene footage from both his make-up work and acting roles. We also get interviews and anecdotes from many of those who worked with Savini, including George Romero, Tony Todd, Robert Rodriguez, Tom Atkins, Corey Feldman and even personal details from his daughter, Lia. It\u2019s a must-see documentary about a true giant in the film and horror film worlds, not only for his fans, but anyone interested in a career in film. It\u2019s a story of a man from humble beginnings who overcame a nightmarish experience as a combat photographer in Viet Nam and many personal hardships to become one of the greatest talents and beloved personalities in the movies, not to mention a true horror icon. Very highly recommended.-MonsterZero NJ",

What the documentary did do was talk about his upbringing and family life - which was really interesting. Savini is a one of a kind talent and his abilities are numerous ! It\u2019s a good documentary to have in the collection but I still like scream greats 1 as my favorite !",
