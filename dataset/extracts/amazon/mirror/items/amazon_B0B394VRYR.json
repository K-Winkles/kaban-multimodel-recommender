We've only used one of the four squares so far; and the purchase was totally worth it for that square alone! It has been tossed around on various floor types: carpet, concrete, and it is constantly flipped over on its front and back. It has endured so much, and it still looks amazing and hasn't broken or cracked at all. The back of the mirror is a little scratched from his beak grabbing on to it, but it is super durable and is still going strong. This mirror will last him for a long time! And if it ever breaks or can't possibly be used any more, we already have a backup of 3 more from this order. :) I definitely recommend this product!",
