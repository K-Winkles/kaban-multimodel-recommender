So I searched for non-pet mirrors instead and came across these. I purchased a pair of the 8\"8\"s and they are so perfect! The two mirrors adhered right to the outer wall of my coop in their chicken run, and their shatterproof material makes them perfect for the girls to peck at all day (instead of pecking at each other). The reflection looked clear to me, but I know some reviewers gave a low rating due to the mirrors having a warped reflection. Even if that was the case (which I didn't notice), my hens don't care. They love it. At these prices I'll be buying a few more.",

They steam up but just run the water over it and you're good for 5 minutes. I brought one to my office and have it hanging there for quick makeup in the morning. Not heavy at all and are a perfect reflection. No distortion.",

This travel mirror is so handy and fixed my problem! It has three light settings, though I generally just use the 'daylight' setting so I can see everything in stark light. It is a great size 'screen' wise so you can see your whole face even though it's a travel mirror. So far the brightness and battery performance are operating as expected. The one note I would say is that it's a bit thicker than expected, and doesn't have a face protector so be mindful of that when traveling with it. I just wrap it in my clothes in my suitcase to ensure it's well protected on the go.",
