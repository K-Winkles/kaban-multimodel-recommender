                "reviewText": "First, this is a great mirror. Optics are good and it is really big! But - it is really big, and heavy. I'm returning it because I don't have a stud to attach it to, and it would pull out of dry-wall with use. In a small bathroom like mine, I am limited in where I can place a mirror like this so the size becomes a problem. These are issues with my space, not with the mirror itself. Just be aware that 9\" is really big and makes it heavy. I will probably opt for the 7\" size.",

Then on installing, if you plan to put it near the light-switch, make sure you have left room for the plate, not just the screw holes themselves!",

The 10 times magnification side is too much for my needs but certainly helpful for others.",
