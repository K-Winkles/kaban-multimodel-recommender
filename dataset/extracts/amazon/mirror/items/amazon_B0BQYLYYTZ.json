                "reviewText": "UPDATE: I believe the fact the light wasn\u2019t working was a user error-ish. I used my Macbook charger thinking it was the same cord needed, but recently I plugged in and happened to notice there\u2019s no charge indicator light. I switched to using the provided charging cable instead and charge indicator came on red, charged fully to green and now the light is brighter and there\u2019s no issue with random shutting off. So, overall I\u2019m VERY HAPPY with the mirror and very happy the light issue is \u201cfixed.\u201d My only feedback to anyone considering purchase is don\u2019t expect to be able to connect with seller after your return window is up.ORIGINAL REVIEW:The mirror is PERFECT for small spaces! It unfolds to a good height to do makeup, and the lighting is better than expected. I LOVE that it is rechargeable. However, after 5 weeks the light randomly turns off between 10-30 second intervals. It\u2019s pretty frustrating, as the mirror wasn\u2019t cheap. The support website goes to a landing page. I\u2019d really appreciate a replacement product, as I believe I got a defective one\u2026here\u2019s hoping the seller sees this!",

The best part is how it unfolds to sit taller off of the counter if you are standing by the sink to get ready. Not too many travel mirrors do this. In fact uou have two different height positions and probably easy to hang up (though I haven't tried). The light settings and brightness work well for me. I want to gift it now to all my friends and family lol.",

                "reviewText": "I had surgery on the side of my foot and the only way to reach the dressing area is to bend my leg and put the foot over my other thigh; the dressing area is then on the underside, where I can't directly see it!This round adjustable lighted mirror solved the issue - I place it on the floor and adjust the height and angle of the nice large mirror so I can see the underside of my foot in it. The lighting is a bonus. Now I can change the dressing on my own, no nurse needed!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this mirror for my daughter to use when she put in her contact lenses. She has had some trouble adjusting to the process of doing that herself, and this mirror really was the key to helping her figure it out. It folds up flat when she isn't using it, so it doesn't waste room in our small house, but it is a nice large size for her to use when she needs it each morning. I think it will also be great for her to use when she starts wanting to wear makeup in a couple of years.",

The 3 different light settings are nice to have and it lasts a couple of weeks on a charge for the amount that I use it. Great mirror - definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "The mirror is aesthetically beautiful. I really like the white instead of the regular silver or gold material. I also like the 3 different colors of light and that the mirror will continuously flip and not be stopped to fli the other way. The only downfall of this mirror is the light is not bright at all. It\u2019s hard to do makeup, tweeze brows and do skincare with the dim light. I might keep the light only because I like how it looks. I wish it had a feature to adjust the brightness.",
