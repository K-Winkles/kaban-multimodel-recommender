        "description": "Product Description When lovely Madeira musician Ana (Emma Cohen) found a man she wanted to marry, her widowed father (Howard Vernon) couldn't bear the thought of her leaving... and hanged himself. Joining a band in Lisbon to get away from the trauma, she'd be tormented by visions of her parent in every mirror, hectoring her to kill anyone who'd want her-a call to which she'd ultimately succumb. Stylish shocker from Jess Franco co-stars Fran\u00e7oise Brion, Philippe Lemaire, Ramiro Oliveros. 100 min. Widescreen; Soundtrack: French DTS HD mono Master Audio; Subtitles: English; audio commentary; featurettes; theatrical trailers. In French with English subtitles. Review It has everything one is looking for in a Franco-Picture: the jazzy soundtrack, the nightclub scenes, the surrealism, and the beautiful women. --Adrian.LetterboxdA harrowing psychodrama of the downward spiral of a young woman (Emma Cohen) into madness and murder. Brilliantly acted, scored and directed. --Robert MonellHas acquired the well-deserved reputation of being among Franco's most unique and ambitious films, and one of the finest productions of his most fertile period. --Tim Lucas",

                "reviewText": "I gotta give 5 stars to Mondo Macabro for presenting such a visually clean, crisp Blu-ray of this movie. I\u2019ll always appreciate the opportunity to see an older film restored with such care and this is the basis of my 5 stars.The movie itself is a trial. Franco has many fans and they all know how his films can be hit and miss. Sorry to say this one is not only dull but irritating.Like so many other Franco films it seems he fell in love with an actress, picked up a camera and made it all up as he went along. Long, plodding scenes of padding can not make up for the lack of story, tension or drama.It\u2019s so easy to imagine Franco giving direction like, \u201cok walk along this pathway and look sad\u201d or \u201cstare straight ahead and look worried\u201d, taking the footage and figuring it out later.For irritation there is a mind-numbingly long musical scene in a jazz club, with the annoyingly catchy chorus of a particular song repeated so many times you\u2019ll be begging for it to stop. Then just when you think it\u2019s finally wrapping up it starts back up again.One thing this film does do well is provide classically unintentional Euro cult laughs with awkward dialogue and absurdly rapid tone shifts. For example in one scene our heroine is moping around a club looking all sullen. A friend encourages her to join him on the dance floor and she unironically starts joyfully dancing like a complete maniac.Ultimately this movie has two things going for it; the first and most important is Emma Cohen. She is insanely pretty and you can\u2019t take your eyes off of her when she is on screen, which, at least, is the vast bulk of the run time. It\u2019s no wonder Franco wanted to film her.The other plus is the gorgeous scenery in the Spanish and Portuguese locations, in particular Madeira. Once upon a time this could be a selling point but now you can just find the same scenery on YouTube if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.So in spite of my 5 stars I would not suggest coming anywhere near The Other Side of the Mirror unless you enjoy Jess Franco, Emma Cohen or both.",
