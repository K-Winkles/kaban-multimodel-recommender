                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great replacement for my Broken ShowerTek",
                "reviewText": "I've been shaving in the shower for almost 20 years and this mirror works perfectly. Over a decade or so ago I purchased a shower tek mirror that circulated water around the back of the mirror to keep it from fogging (same basic principle to reduce fogging for temperature differences as this Shave Well) except it was flawed by the fact that the plastic arm (tubing) that holds the Shower Tek and circulates the water eventually failed after just a year or so. After that I realized I could just keep using the mirror but had to use RainX or I used toothpaste or other soap and the warm shower water to keep it fog free long enough to get a shave. Since the Shower Tek tubing arm broke years ago, I've been holding the mirror in one hand while shaving with the other. I've noticed over the years that shaving in the shower after washing my face with a good facial soap did not require shaving cream if the water was warm enough and I had a good razor. I don't rinse the facial soap off, I simply shave it off. So shaving while holding the mirror literally only takes 60 - 90 seconds.Fast forward 10+ years and my Shower Tek fell on the hard tile floor in the shower one too many times and a few weeks ago it cracked and shattered leaving glass shards on the floor of the shower while I was trying to shave. In my search to find a replacement mirror that wouldn't break the bank, would stay fog free for at least a few minutes, and would not shatter into pieces if I dropped it (water and soap = slippery in shower) I was fortunate enough to find this Shave Well Fog-Free mirror. Deluxe Shave Well Fog-free Shower Mirror - 33% Larger Than the Original Shave Well Mirror I see several 1 and 2 star reviews and I just can't wrap my head around those reviews. I am an experienced shower shaver for two decades. I have finally found the perfect shower mirror. It's small enough to hold in one hand while shaving (hanging or positioning any mirror in the shower doesn't give me enough light anywhere) which is perfect since you can move the mirror easily to see what needs to be shaved. Holding it also allows you to easily rinse the front and back to equalize the temperature to keep it fog free during your shave, and also allows a quick rinse in the shower (if necessary) when you rinse the razor.The last thing I do in the shower is shave so that my skin and the mirror have had time to warm up to get a good shave. I've found that the Shave Well mirror stays fog free for much longer than I need it. I have even attached several photos so you can see that my shower door is fogged but the mirror is not. That is after shaving and rinsing off and opening the shower door to get my phone to take the pictures.Anyone that says this mirror fogs up, either has it in the wrong place, did not prep it with toothpaste or facial soap, or hold it under warm water (front and back) long enough (I do it for about 30 seconds, 15 on each side). This is science people and it just plain works. You should also know that I accidently knocked the mirror off it's hook a couple days ago and it crashed to the floor. I'm glad it did not shatter, but it did land right on the bottom left corner and it did chip a tiny piece of the material (I seems to be some sort of plastic or lexan with a mirror coating). The mirror survived the fall with grace and while I have a small chip in the corner, it still stays fog free and I still get a great view of when I'm shaving in the shower.I'll be buying some of these for holiday gifts for my friends that have never experienced shower shaving and all of the benefits that go along with it. If you're at all curious or on the fence, I say take the plunge, you'll be glad you did.",

                "reviewText": "Deluxe Shave Well Fog-free Shower. Mirror I started shaving in the shower more than 20 years ago, and all the while I've been in need of a mirror. Don't ask me why I didn't seek a solution sooner, as the quality of my shave frequently lacked. Then I found this great little mirror here at Amazon. No, it's not fancy, and it won't shave your face for you, but it is perfect for the purpose for which it is intended. Contrary to the single, 1-star review, there is nothing, whatsoever, wrong with the mirror that can't be attributed to anything beside user laziness. I like the fact that the mirror is made of plastic as I don't have to worry should I knock it off it's hook. That hook, which sticks to the wall of the shower, is both a simple means of hanging it, and more than effective for that purpose. The reflective surface of the mirror is clear, and void of any visual defects making it just what you need to see how close you are shaving to your sideburns, and to the edge of your nostrils. What more could you want, especially for such a reasonable price? The only problem with the mirror is one that is unavoidable with any such product, and results from spray from the shower head. The only way to avoid the problem is to turn off the shower (isn't going to happen in my shower). I simply grab the mirror, put it in the water stream from the shower head for a couple of seconds, and put it back on the hook. Problem solved. If you are looking for a well priced solution to the need for a shaving mirror in the shower, and you don't want to spend a lot of money, this mirror will do just fine.*****SOLUTION TO SPRAY,AND FOGGING PROBLEM: Regardless of how well you pre-heat the mirror, if you spend enough time in the shower, this mirror will begin to fog, or accumulate spray from the shower head. A very easy, good solution, for those who use \"Clean Shower\", is to lightly spray the mirror. You don't have to put much on at all, just a light spray. Not only will the mirror remain free of fog, spray will just roll off. You will have to re-apply during your next shower, but as cheap as Clean Shower is, you'd be able to use a bottle for several months if you were using just on the mirror. At under $2.00 a bottle, that isn't a big deal. When you factor in the outrageous price of razor blades, vs. the price of the Clean Shower, and how much longer your razor blades will last shaving in the shower, you can easily see that it is a win, win deal.",

                "reviewText": "I have used this for 6 months. It works as intended, hasn't broken the few times dropped, and the hook it is packaged with is still sticking to the wall. Water does not rain down on it, so hopefully the adhesion will last a good while. This mirror does fog up as you should expect, but a quick rinse under the hot water and it is good to go. Worth the money even if it broke tomorrow, for the price and ease of use I'd order another one.",

                "reviewText": "I had one of these for three years and really liked it. Then I left it in a hotel room. So I ordered another. It works as described. I cannot rate the suction or mounting system that comes with it since I don't use them. I use my own suction cup that had a wire hook that I removed. It has a small groove on the face of it that the mirror fits in perfectly. I can take the cup off the wall anytime I want to clean. If the suction cup fails and the mirror falls there is no damage. I just put it back. It works a lot better for me than fancier mirrors I have tried with frames and slots for razors and such. If I lose this one I will order another!",
