                "media_text": "Why choose JiBen LED Makeup Mirror? SPACE SAVER - Our mirror takes up zero precious counter space. Attached it to your existing mirrors or any surface that is smooth, non-porous and flat.CORDLESS & PORTABLE - No more dealing with messy cords and searching for an outlet. The rotating arm folds up compactly and neatly. It's ideal for home and travel.MODERN DESIGN - Unlike our competitors that have bulky battery compartment in the back, our mirror holds 3 AA batteries inside the mirror's casing. This results in a sleek and elegant look.NATURAL DAYLIGHT LEDs - Longer lasting and brighter than conventional incandescent bulbs. Our mirror diffuses the light from 14 LEDs to illuminate your face. Instructions Prior to mounting, clean surface with soap and water. Any dust or grime will prevent proper contact with the suction cup. Your mirror uses an unique suction locking cup that is more powerful than a regular suction cup. It does not require any glue, tape or silicone. Check to make sure that the suction lock is not already engaged by twisting it counter-clockwise. Press the suction lock against the surface and activate the locking mechanism by twisting clockwise. Adding a little bit of moisture will also help to create a stronger suction. Disclaimer JiBen LED Makeup Mirror requires a clean, flat and smooth surface of at least 3\"X3\" for the suction cup to work properly.The suction cup works best on non-porous surfaces, such as glass, ceramic tiles, porcelain, marble, granite and fiberglass.Avoid grout, stucco, drywall, wallpaper and other textured wall.Requires 3 AA batteries (not included).NOTE : This magnifying mirror requires your face to be within 5 inches for a clear undistorted image.",

I bought this one. The suction cup is strong, on the proper surface. It has not fallen off the vanity mirror yet. I do constantly have to push it back up, as it tends to droop over time. Not horribly bad though. I can\u2019t tell you about the light because I have not yet put batteries in it, as I use the vanity lights. It is a nice little mirror and will serve its purpose nicely, I guess I am just spoiled by the first one. I would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "If you're looking for the perfect magnification in a small mirror, 10x is perfect. I initially bought a 15x and had to be within 3-4 inches of the mirror to see clearly. There literally as no space for my hand to get between my face and the mirror to do my makeup lol. 10x is perfect. It fits nice and tight to my wall mirror. Honestly the only thing that would make it more perfect would be if the suction base also had a collar with holes for screws so it could also mount to a surface where the suction cup won't work (dry wall, a wood countertop, etc). I initially installed lithium batteries but the light didn't work, so I used alkaline. It's bright. I tried uploading pictures but it's not working. I'll try later and update my review.",

                "reviewText": "Both my husband and myself need reading glasses to see up close anymore, and I had other mirrors around the house that were magnified but saw this and put it up on our main bathroom mirror and even my husband uses it! It hasn\u2019t fallen down once as some have said. But I followed the instructions. It does say after a certain period to take it off and reseal the suction. Lights are a little dim. But may need new batteries. But for what we need it\u2019s perfect. If I need something better for up close lightning I just use my desk magnifier ring make up light.",
