Olivia de Havilland gives a great tour-de-force performance as twin sisters: one good but weak, the other a psychopath. involved in a murder case. It's difficult to tell them apart and it takes some wit and cunning ideas from a psychiatrist (Lew Ayres) and a detective (Thomas Mitchell), to solve the enigma. Robert Siodmak was a master of the genre. Dark shadows and evil scheming everywhere, just like in his prior masterpieces: \"Phantom Lady\" (1944) or \"The Killers\" (1946). This high definition transfer shows the original crisp images. It's region free and subtitled in English. Very much recommended.",

                "reviewText": "\"The Dark Mirror\" has not been shown on TV for many years. I remember seen it when I was a teenager and being completely mesmerized by Olivia DeHavilland's subtle playing of identical twin sisters. (This feat was also accomplished by her WB friend/competitor, Bette Davis in more or less at about the same time in another melodrama, \"A Stolen Life\".)The plot consists of a murder that seems to point to one of the twins - one naive and one cunning. THe final outcome iis telegraphed quite early (for a contemporary audience), but it is nevertheless fun to watch the story as it unfolds to its obvious conclusion. This little B-movie gets the usual deft direction by noir expert, Robert Siodmak. Thomas Mitchell plays the detective and Lew Ayres a psychiatrist in love with one of the sisters.. The Blu-Ray version by Olive Films is tack sharp and with excellent B&W contrast. THis is a must for lover of film noir, 40's B&W melodramas, Siodmak and DeHavilland fans, in other words, a must.",

I love watching Olivia DeHavilland playing opposite herself. She has always been such an amazing actress. The Snake Pit is another favorite of mine. Her acting skill, while in the dramatized style of the era, still manages to be compelling so many years later. She is an amazing actress and this movie the plot line is engaging and fun. Love it.",

                "reviewText": "Fans of this movie will be delighted to know that the new DVD release from Olive Films is in pristine condition and makes viewing it a double pleasure, especially for de Havilland fans.THE DARK MIRROR ('46) is a brisk, supercharged 85 minutes, a taut psychological suspense tale directed by Robert Siodmak (who directed THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE and THE KILLERS). Dimitri Tiomkin's clever background score is an added bonus.It stars Olivia de Havilland in a fascinating dual role as Ruth and Terry Collins, sisters involved in the murder of a doctor they were both dating. When good sister Ruth gives her bad twin an alibi, detective Thomas Mitchell asks psychiatrist Lew Ayres to determine which twin could be the killer, based on their differing personalities. Of course he falls in love with the good twin and solves the case in an effective ending which gives de Havilland the chance to do some real emoting. A clever scene has the bad twin pretending to be the good one in a serious talk with doctor Ayres in which he reveals what makes the psycho sister tick.It's a double-layered cat-and-mouse scene in which he is really talking about her (not her sister) and de Havilland's reactions are fascinating to watch. Thomas Mitchell is excellent as a relentless but befuddled detective unhappy with the game the sisters are playing. Richard Long has a small role as an admirer of one of the twins--or is it both of them? Bit roles are well played with occasional flashes of humor and the whole thing moves swiftly under Siodmak's tight direction.By the way, 1946 was a strong year for de Havilland. After being off the screen for more than two years due to legal action against Warner Bros., she suddenly had four films in release: DEVOTION (as Charlotte Bronte), THE WELL GROOMED BRIDE, TO EACH HIS OWN and THE DARK MIRROR, entering a four-year period climaxed at the end of the decade by THE SNAKE PIT and THE HEIRESS--and two Oscars.Summing up: two Olivia de Havilland's are better than one. Life magazine reported that she \"contributes to the impression gained from TO EACH HIS OWN that she is the actress to beat for this year's Academy Award.\"",

                "reviewTitle": "THE DARK MIRROR BLU RAY from ARROW",
                "reviewText": "I do so miss the glorious days of television in the late 50's and 60's when classic B/W movies were screened on a regular basis. Nothing against colour of course, but when did you see a B/w film on any TV channel (except some freeview of course). The DARK MIRROR is one of those films. Perhaps not quite a classic, but a very worthwhile purchase, particularly this BLURAY from Arrow. An excellent transfer ratio 1.37:1 (narrow black side bars). Superb picture, good sound and optional English subtitles (thankyou Arrow). Plus, and I love it when this occurs - a 30 mintute radio version from 1960 with again de Havilland, and that excellent actor John Dehner (such a recognisable voice), and a film commentary (never can get into them!). The film? It's still a good mystery thriller with amazing, for the time, SFX, enabling de Havilland to act with herself, and you \"can't see the join\". She plays twins, one good, one bad, but which or who, is which or who? Thomas Mitchell is a slightly elderly police lieutenant (ggod performence), and Lew Ayres is a slightly elderly psychiatrist and love interest to one of the twins - but which.....Only 85' and director Siodmak ratchets up the pace and tension. Highly recomended to those of us who still enjoy a good movie of the period and genre.",

                "reviewText": "The Dark Mirror is directed by Robert Siodmak and adapted to screenplay by Nunnally Johnson from a story by Vladimir Pozner. It stars Olivia de Havilland, Lew Ayres, Thomas Mitchell, Richard Long and Charles Evans. Music is by Dimitri Tiomkin and cinematography by Milton Krasner.A man appears to have been murdered by one of the identical twin Collins sisters, but both of whom have an alibi. The police and the psychiatrist have their work cut out...Straight out of the corner of postwar Hollywood that began to take fascination with mental illness, The Dark Mirror triumphs more as a technical exercise than as anything resembling thought provoking analysis. The simplistic Freudian elements aside, film is impressively mounted and performed by Siodmak and de Havilland respectively. Story follows the trajectory of a cat-and-mouse game, with the makers nicely putting us the viewers into the same struggle the authorities have in sussing out which sister is the damaged killer.Siodmak's (The Spiral Staircase) attention to detail and grasp of mood setting really lifts the piece to greater heights. Aided by the considerable photographic skills of Krasner (The Set-Up), Siodmak creates a world of psychological disturbance, a place aligned with suspense and symbolism. Right from the doozy of an opening scene to the denouement, Siodmak manages to keep the contrivances to the rear of the play and let de Havilland and the visual textures be the prime focus.The effects work is very good, with de Havilland having to quite often play off against herself. Sure in today's age of High Definition et al, you don't have to stretch your viewing experience to see how the effects were done, but why would you? Just enjoy de Havillland's riveting performances in the dual roles (see also her excellence in The Snake Pit two years later), her skillful little subtleties as she deftly plays out the respective psychological traits of sibling rivalry gone astray.Is it a gimmick movie? Well no not really, it's honest about what it wants to achieve in terms of psychiatric observations and treatments. Yet lesser lights than Siodmak, Krasner and de Havilland would have struggled to make it work, especially as the romance angle in the screenplay nearly derails the requisite mood come the finale. Thankfully, in spite of some obvious negatives, it's still well worthy of viewing investment. 7/10",
