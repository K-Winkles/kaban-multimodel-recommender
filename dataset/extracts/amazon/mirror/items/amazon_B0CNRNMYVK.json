                "reviewText": "I'm pleased with this XRAMFY mirror. The aluminum frame has a nice, gold and blemish free finish. It's a good size for either over a door or a wall. the mirror is flat and without distortions.The most impressive thing about this mirror is that it holds its form. I've had too many mirrors that flex or bow when hung on a wall, or the frame comes apart over time. This mirror is stiff and sturdy and will hold its shape.The hardware is good for hanging over a door. The hooks are squared and fit nicely over a standard bedroom, closet or bathroom door. It doesn't bang when the door is opened.The hardware is easy to attach and the predrilled holes on the back of the frame are precise. The only issue I had was the included hollow wall fasteners. I prefer heavier duty hollow wall fasteners. The ones included are adequate.I think this looks great. I like having a mirror that will hold its shape. I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, this thing came in top notch packaging they certainly were doing their best to avoid seven years of bad luck.The mirror looks nice and was as described. The frame is not wood, so there is some flex to it. We chose the door hanging route in the bathroom since it had the best light. The two hang hooks screw into mounts in the back of the mirror frame and have the option to hang it a little higher on the door. We have 8\" doors though, so we hung it on the lowest option.There are two stick on pads for the bottom of the frame to both protect it from slamming into the door when opened and closed, and to stick it too the door if you pull off both sides of the sticky tape block. The hardware even came with a screw driver, so you don't even need tools unless you choose to wall mount.",

I was so confused and disappointed when I received it in the mail and saw it was the arched mirror. I went back to the listing to investigate and I realized that the arched mirror in the picture says it\u2019s \u201crectangle edge\u201d and the picture of the rectangle edge says \u201carched\u201d. So you\u2019ll want to be sure you choose going by the PICTURE of the mirror you want and not by what it actually says it is.",
