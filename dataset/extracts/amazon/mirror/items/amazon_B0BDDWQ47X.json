                "reviewText": "I was worried it was going to be too small... or just one more super cheaply made mirror with a frustratingly poor design like so many others I've owned throughout the past twenty years or so. This one is on the small side, but don't let that fool you, it's still within the optimally functional range, so it's all good. The handle is sturdy and adjustable so as to be easily used as both a handheld and a countertop mirror. The grippy soft material gives it an overall quality feel that is substantial and altgough it is easily adjustable, it's not loose or floppy in any respect. The hinges have the perfect resistance, it stays where you want it, period. It can be easily hung on a hook out of the way for storage or you can adjust it and use it in an additional hands free mode off the countertop saving space. As I mentioned earlier, I was concerned over the size, especially since I tend to love a bigger mirror, it's honestly been just the right size for every use I've needed it for, plus it can reasonably fit in your luggage for travel. I guess those big mirrors were just compensating for what they lacked in functionality and design. It's been years since I've had a handheld mirror I've felt so good about, I'm genuinely happy I didn't let my reservations prevent me from owning and loving this great new addition to my routine",

I love the matt texture on the frame and handle, it gives it an elegant look. Love how the handle can be folded as well. I leave it on my bathroom counter top folded. This would be my go to mirror if I needed another one.",
