If you like hot showers, you have to leave your shower curtain slightly ajar, for cooler air to reach the mirror, or else it will fog up in a minute or two. But I had to buy this type because I needed to put it on the opposite side of the shower, away from the shower head. I find the kind where you add hot water behind the mirror the type of anti-fog mirror that works best, but of course, slightly more of a hassle.",
