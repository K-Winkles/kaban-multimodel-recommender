                "reviewText": "Ok, so I don\u2019t normally write reviews, but this little travel makeup mirror set is my new favorite thing! First of all, there are 2 mirrors (one small 10x magnified mirror and a larger regular magnification) that are both very high quality. VERY IMPORTANT In a mirror! Especially the little magnification mirror - it\u2019s bad enough to see your face magnified at my age, but a bad quality mirror makes it way worse!Also, the large mirror has one continuous light all the way around instead of the individual led lights which gives a very natural even light. One of the best things is that the light setting is adjustable - it dims continuously as you hold the button and the high setting super bright! Plus the little 10x magnification mirror is magnetic and sticks anywhere on the front of the larger mirror which I have not seen in other mirrors. I even use it in the kitchen attached to my refrigerator!And the height adjustability is a key feature - the ability to change the height eliminates the need for precarious balancing acts with random items just to get the right angle. It's a small yet significant detail that makes a world of difference. The size is perfect for travel or home. I travel a lot, so its slim size makes it fit in my bag no matter how much I overpack. Lastly, it\u2019s rechargeable with a usb input! I would recommend this product unconditionally.",

                "reviewText": "I was using my daughter's 'flipable' makeup mirror and got this one since I was moving. It is nice and compact, easy to store, set up and use. Because of the way the magnification is achieved (with a small magnetic mirrored square that you attach to the larger mirror), I find it takes me a bit to adjust my focus to just the magnified portion of the mirror.All in all, it works for what I wanted it for and I would recommend for travel and light use of the magnification piece. If your focus or primary use will be the magnification piece, I might look for another option.",

                "reviewText": "This mirror is excellent! I ordered it to take on trips with me, since I am rarely happy with the bathroom lighting in hotels these days. I also always need a magnifying mirror with me for my brows and doing eye makeup now that I have the standard over 45 vision issues.I charged the mirror before packing it to go on a cruise. It's a full sized 8\" face mirror but folds up very flat and doesn't take up much space. Fit neatly in the included storage bag along with the charging cable and smaller magnifying mirror.The fold out stand is very stable. The mirror angle is easy to adjust and stays in place. The led lights provide plenty of light and are brightness and color adjustable. The small magnifying mirror was great- magnets in it are strong and it stays put wherever you place it on the mirror (even in rough seas).I used this mirror daily- sometimes twice a day- for 10 days and never needed to recharge it. The battery life is good!I am really happy with this mirror and would definitely recommend it. It would make a great gift too!",

                "reviewText": "This mirror can adjust to suit almost any height or angle needed. When I\u2019m at home I\u2019m usually sitting at my desk to put on my makeup but when I\u2019m at my parents\u2019 house it\u2019s at a bathroom counter sitting on a stool and when I\u2019m in our campervan it\u2019s sitting in a tiny bathroom at a weird angle. Since the base of the unit is the same size as the mirror it adds amazing stability. The main bracket somewhat snaps to an upright position but then the mirror angles to accommodate different heights. The mirror can then rotate around to the other side and again can angle for various heights. Super functional.A magnification mirror is needed once you start aging and need the extra zoom in order to put on mascara and such. The additional 10x mirror being magnetized and then being able to stick right on the larger mirror is wonderful. Although the 10x doesn\u2019t fit inside the larger mirror for storage the small size makes it easy to carry in a purse.Unfortunately the size is about an inch too big to include inside my travel makeup bag, which is only about 7 inches wide. The stability, angling options, slim design, magnetic 10x mirror and being re-chargeable are enough reasons though for me to still bring along when traveling and just pack it in-between my clothes.",

                "reviewText": "- This mirror is so compact and lightweight, but at the same time, it feels incredibly sturdy.- It can be adjusted many different ways because of how the stand opens up.- The two folding joint parts are very strong. You can position the mirror at almost any angle and it will hold in place.- There are two touch buttons on the mirror\u2014 one for power and the other for light temperature. Both buttons are super responsive, even to a light tap.- This mirror fits perfect in my vanity drawer, so it quickly became my go-to makeup mirror. I previously had a different stand mirror, but it wasn't foldable. I was getting sick of leaving it out on the counter all the time.- I've only ever had small travel mirrors before, so I'm excited to take this one on a trip over the summer. It will easily slide into a suitcase pocket or a carry-on bag.- The included bag holds the mirror, the optional close-up mirror attachment, and the cord.- The only con is that the strings on the included bag are too silky so they don't stay tied. That's not too big of a deal for me, I'll probably use a different bag for it when I travel though.- The mirror itself is great 5/5 stars. Highly recommend.",
