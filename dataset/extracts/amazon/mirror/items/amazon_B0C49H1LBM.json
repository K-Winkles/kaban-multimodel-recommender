The clean lines of this mirror and the black finish of the frame will fit very well in the modern and minimalist style I am going for. The mirror was delivered in a parcel that was a little beat up on the outside but there was no damage to the mirror itself, as the mirror was well-protected from the rough handling inside the box. The quality of the mirror is very good in terms of the image being reflected but also it seems that the fabrication of the mirror used quality materials and was done with attention to detail. I was particularly impressed with the mounting system used for this mirror; it will provide for a very solid mount to the wall regardless of the orientation chosen, but also greatly facilitate the installation. Time will tell how the mirror fares in the humid environment of a bathroom but at first glance, I am very satisfied with this purchase.",
