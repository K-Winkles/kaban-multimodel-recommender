                "reviewText": "During the lockdown period of the COVID pandemic, all the barber shops were closed. My hair was growing to an uncomfortable length. I did what many did during that time - turn to the internet and DIY. I reasoned that if I wasn't going to be seeing much people in-person during that time, it would be OK if I messed up trying to cut my hair. I bought a set of clippers and off I went with a handheld mirror.Fast-forward 2 years later. Barbar shops are open, but I'm still cutting my own hair. I learned a few important things during this journey. The first is to buy a good clipper set. The second is to use plenty of mirrors. While you get eventually get proficient with using a wall mirror plus a hand mirror, being able to free your other hand and not having to constantly reposition the hand mirror would have made things a lot easier.As it seems I'll be cutting my own hair for a while, I decided to cave in and buy a tri-fold mirror set. It's a simple concept that I've considered buying my own mirrors and making this myself, but finding a good way to mount it and finding strong hinges to position the side mirrors made it too much effort to DIY the mirror setup.This mirror set is convenient because it's an all-in-one unit. The door mounts pivot out from the unit and are on telescopic rods (think of the old-school radio antennas). Hook it over the door (or whatever is your mounting source) and pull it down to the right height. Open up both panels of the mirror until it's at the best angle for you. The panels stay in place due to the friction on the hinge. It should allow you to see the part of your head behind your ears. For a full view of the back of your head, you'd have to position the panels parallel to each other and look direct at one of the panels.There's not much to fault this simple item. If anything, I'd love if the mirrors had some more height to them just to have more viewing surface, but that would mean the unit would be much bigger when folded.",

                "reviewText": "I like the fact that it fold within itself, easy to store, or you could leave it hanging on the door. It's well built, I just wish there was a size that was a little larger as far as height goes. Cause I'm doing my haircut in a small bathroom and I find myself having to adjust my head to get a good view. If you're in a room with more space, that's not too much of a problem. LED are quite bright, yet, it would make sense to have some LEDs on the side mirrors as well, cause it seems it's quite limited to the middle and the light falls off on the side. The materials used for the hanging this mirror is the same as a old fashion tv antenna or old radio. That's quite genius, cause those antennas are made to last. The hooks hanging over my door hangs quite fine and have no problems.Just the height and I wish there were extra LEDs on the side mirrors. Especially for haircut cause I have dark hair and it's hard to see what you are cutting. I guess the work around is to install custom LED straps around the edges of the mirror and that should be enough.. other than this, this is a good buy for the price",

                "reviewText": "This mirror is perfect for self styling your hair. It is a solid, functional piece of equipment that my family plans to use for precision styling, parting, braiding and so on.It comes with a cape, barber tool to help get clean line ups, charging cable, and two white hooks with metal prongs sticking out that I haven't figured out what to do with. Instructions are not included.This model is housed in plastic and features a charging light that is red when charging and turns blue when finished. The adjustable piece attached to the handle is made of metal and reminds me of the old tv antennas we used to adjust to get a good signal on the TV. You have to make sure you pull the handle up evenly so that the mirror isn't lopsided when hanging. Also, the mirror's hinges are a little looser than expected so if your mirror isn't positioned well, expect the mirrors to sway or move out of place.The door hooks are housed within the back of the handle and are plastic. All you have to do is flip them out, adjust the length you want to hang the mirror, and then hang it up. I would not try to adjust the mirror too much after hanging as the hooks don't seem to be that strong.All in all, I think this mirror will stand the test of time as long as it isn't dropped or thrown about.",

                "reviewText": "Decently solid but not something I would open and close and hang up and take down daily (don't know if it would last that long doing that.)Aside from that, hang it directly across of a big mirror, and you will be able to see 360 degrees around yourself. Just takes a bit of adjusting angles but perfect for solo hair cutting!Hangs above the door pretty easily. I think the hanger part was a bit big for the door, but once you shut the door it hangs fine and firm.",

                "reviewText": "I like that it folds nicely and can be stored away and its quite sturdy. Nice that it hangs on top of the door and still able to close the door so I cant cut my hair in the bathroom. The hooks that hang on top of the door are telescopic so you can adjust it to your own height. When the mirrors fold out, the angles are adequate enough to see the back of your head. The mirrors are also large and wide enough to see the entirety off your head. The light is nice and bright but I wish all the mirrors had LED strips. I wish I had purchased this during the pandemic when I started cutting my own hair. It has definitely made me more confident with cutting my own hair. Worth it",

Das dreiteilige Design ist ideal, um verschiedene Blickwinkel zu haben, was besonders hilfreich ist, wenn ich meine Haare selbst schneide. Die Tatsache, dass er wiederaufladbar ist, finde ich sehr praktisch.Ich sch\u00e4tze die H\u00f6henverstellbarkeit des Spiegels, die es mir erm\u00f6glicht, ihn genau auf meine Bed\u00fcrfnisse einzustellen. Dar\u00fcber hinaus ist der Zusammenbau recht einfach und die allgemeine Konstruktion scheint solide und langlebig zu sein.Ein kleiner Kritikpunkt w\u00e4re die Helligkeit der Beleuchtung. Obwohl sie in den meisten F\u00e4llen ausreichend ist, k\u00f6nnte sie in einem dunkleren Raum etwas intensiver sein. Dennoch ist sie f\u00fcr meine Bed\u00fcrfnisse ausreichend.Alles in allem gebe ich diesem Spiegel vier von f\u00fcnf Sternen. Er ist funktional, praktisch und erleichtert das Selbststyling erheblich. Ich w\u00fcrde ihn auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen.",
