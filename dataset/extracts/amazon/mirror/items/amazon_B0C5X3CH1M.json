                "reviewText": "I was unimpressed as soon as I opened the box. Feels light and poorly constructed. Doesn't come with batteries either. Attaches via an adhesive pad that feels like it will fail within 30 days, as soon as soapy water begins seeping between it and the wall. Im returning it after the first use, so I can't say for sure but I don't have faith it will hold and won't wait for it to fall on break on me. Immediately fogged up the very first use. No squeegee included so I tried wiping away the fog with my hand, which just made the light cycle between modes.",

                "reviewText": "This fogs up very easily. If you splash some water on it, it will go clear for a little while then fog up again. A plus however is when you throw water on it the light turns on and off?!?!!Also sticks out from the wall pretty far so I hope you have a big shower or ninja skills to dodge it while living around. Am looking to buy a different one now just after 2 days.",

                "reviewText": "My husband required a mirror in his shower because there was nowhere else in this small house to shave. This fogless shower mirror has an anti-fog coating that prevents fogging even when vapor from the shower is recurrent.The LED lighting on the mirror is dimmable and can be displayed in three distinct color modes. The brightness can be adjusted according to your requirements and preferences, and the mirror measures approximately six by eight inches. It also has a holder on the bottom to retain the razors securely.It is easy to install in the shower because the adhesive hooks adhere to most smooth surfaces. The mirror is resistant to shattering and impacts. It is reasonably priced, the ideal measure for the shower, and meets my husband's needs admirably.",
