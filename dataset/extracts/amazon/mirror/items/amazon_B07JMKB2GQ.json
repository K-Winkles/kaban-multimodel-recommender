                "reviewText": "I love this mirror. I bought it a year ago and the clean, simple LED design is exactly what I want in a makeup mirror - no fancy gimmicks, just intense LIGHT. There are 2 additional magnifications on the left side - perfect for seeing up close if you need to, but they don't take over the whole design (and I don't know about you, but I like to apply my makeup in \"real dimension\" and not super magnified - useful for tweezing my eyebrows but that's all I need it for). Also, I love the modern LED lights. It's a solid strip around the perimeter of the middle mirror, which for me works way better than the (distracting) Hollywood lights around other similar mirrors.It stores neatly in my linen closet and travels easily enough (I have not tried taking the base off, but usually shove it in my backpack between clothes when bringing it on a roadtrip). When I do travel without it, I find that I really miss it as other mirrors just don't emit the same quality of light. Seriously - I have put makeup on in otherwise complete darkness and this mirror makes it look flawless.One caveat: if you can leave a micro USB cable plugged into it, do so. Unfortunately all the plugging and unplugging does a number on the pins. Eventually mine wouldn't turn on when plugged in (after lasting more than a year) so I discovered the battery option...but sadly the lights were not nearly as bright as they'd been to begin with.BUT I noticed the \"lifetime guarantee\" on the product description, contacted the company, and heard back within hours that they were sending me a replacement, free of charge. Great customer service and easy replacement process - so do yourself a favor and buy this mirror, you won't regret it!",

                "reviewText": "I have gone through 3 make up mirrors trying to find one that was bright enough for my house. My house has very poor lighting and in the summer to keep it cool I choose to keep it on the dark side inside, cuz if I open all the blinds it gets hot in the house quickly. Anyway, this mirror is actually bright!!! The first three mirrors I got were conair and Onyx( or something like that) the onyx one was bright but broke the first week. The plastic started to split. and within a few months the charging cord stopped working. the conair ones advertised that they were bright, but were so dim, I could light a candle and get more light...I was furious. I need to be able to see my face to do my make-up. a dim lit ring around the mirror is useless. I would have been just as well buying a plain unlit mirror.I suggest this mirror, because its compact, but opens up to more then enough reflection. It has every thing you need plus the lights light up very bright. I just got it though, so I guess we will see how well it holds up over time. But I don't do a lot of traveling. so as long as I only use it at home, I expect it will last a while.",

                "reviewText": "This was a bit smaller than other mirrors I was looking at but still a really decent size. Works great for compact areas. I haven't tried this with batteries only plugged in with an attached USB cord (supplied) and wall plug in (not supplied). I can't seem to get it to get brighter, but that could just be user error. It says to lightly hold down the power button and it should get brighter and dim. I can't seem to get mine to do that. BUT likely to be user error.The usb cord that comes with the mirror is a little on the short side so it's a little limiting with the space I was hoping to use it for, However as a travel mirror this works great! It's a little too small to use as a main vanity mirror (but then again I like big mirrors) and the light is a great enhancement to natural lighting. It is very bright, however the light doesn't really reach my face unless I'm right up in the mirror. I like some distance, but if you're able to use a small compact mirror to do your entire face you could love this! I don't possess that super power lol It could just take getting used to since I typically use a full size mirror with just natural lighting and horrible lighting when it's not daylight.I do really like the placement of the mirrors but wish I'd have gotten one with some stronger magnification... probably wise I didn't because 3x magnification allows me to see well enough to tame the brows without obsessing over every pore.This is a great mirror and really durable! I love that id does come with a usb cord just wish it was a little longer! The rest aren't deal breakers, just lack of my researching sizes, and not knowing how much magnification I wanted. This is definitely easier to use than holding onto a mirror to do eye makeup so it was absolutely worth it! It's not my dream mirror but an absolute great addition to ease the process of doing makeup and skin care!",

                "reviewText": "Okay so a brutally honest review\u2026Pay more for a better mirror. The lighting is NOT bright enough, and my vision is perfect. I was hoping the lighting was bright as I noticed there aren\u2019t lights on the sides so if you need light in addition to the magnifying mirrors\u2026it\u2019s insufficient. It\u2019s average lighting at best, if comparing to my phone flashlight my phone gets 5 out of 5 stars and this gets maybe 3. Otherwise good deal, I will return and get a mirror with brighter lighting and bigger mirror. Size is good for small spaces, gold color not too bright & fake looking. East touch button. That\u2019s all. Real review from non biased person",
