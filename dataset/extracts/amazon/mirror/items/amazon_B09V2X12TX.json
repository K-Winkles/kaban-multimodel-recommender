                "reviewText": "Cannot be cut with scissors. It shatters. This is my edited review. But the mirror itself is very clear.Read on\u2026\u2026Since one of the photos the seller has in the description shows scissors cutting the mirror, that\u2019s why I purchased this. When the plastic shattered, posted a negative review. I changed this review because I wrote the seller. They said that they upgraded their product and requested Amazon to update the photos in the listing. They expressed their frustration and they were very apologetic.They told me that this mirror is plexiglass and can be cut with a hook knife or plexiglass knife. I checked and found the plexiglass knife at my local big box store and it costs a little over $5. Since I wanted to do a project with young kids I told the seller that knives were not feasible and asked for a refund which the seller quickly gave me.Let me say this about the mirror. The reflection is EXTREMELY CLEAR. in some ways it is clearer than the standard mirrors. What makes the image clearer is that this the mirror is thinner than the standard glass mirror. Although it\u2019s not a FIRST SURFACE mirror, it\u2019s so thin that the image appears clearer especially at close distances.I changed this review from one star to four stars. Hopefully Amazon will edit this description to what the seller requested.If you have any questions about how to cut it, just ask the seller and they will contact you and give you detailed instructions on how to cut it.",
