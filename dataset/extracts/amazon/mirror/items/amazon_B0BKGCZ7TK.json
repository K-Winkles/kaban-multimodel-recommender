                "reviewText": "This is a great little mirror that can be used anywhere. In the box you get the mirror, an attachable 10x magnification mirror, the stand, and a USB cable for charging. It was super simple to assemble, just attach the base. The lights work either via USB charging, or 4 AAA batteries (batteries not included). The compact size makes it great to take anywhere, and the fold out design gives you plenty of mirror space to see everything you need. I don't have much space in my bathroom for makeup, and hotel bathrooms are tricky to see close up, while wall mirrors don't offer enough light. This allows me to set up in any space I am comfortable. The ability to adjust the angle and brightness allows me to get the exact view I need. If you are a performer who travels a lot, this is a great purchase to allow yourself to do highly detailed makeup just about anywhere. I definitely recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "This makeup mirror looks just like the picture. A little smaller than I wanted but that's my fault for not checking the measurements. It's still big enough to do my hair and makeup. I like that it has a tiltable base and some magnifying mirrors on the side. The led lights are very bright and they are surrounding the center mirror only. I personally think it would be better if there were less lights on the mirror because it's very straining on my eyes. You can dim them by holding your finger on the power button but since there are so many bulbs around that small of a mirror it's still too much. I probably will keep it for a travel mirror and get something different for daily use.",
