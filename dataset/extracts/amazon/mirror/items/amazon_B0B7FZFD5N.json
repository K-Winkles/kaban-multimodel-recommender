I made sure to follow the instructions carefully so that the product would adhere properly to the wall but it still fell off after just a few hours. I had to adhere the mirror with my own command strips so that I can still use the it.I still like the mirror for being a safe for kids, clear, and in a size that works for my intended use. My son uses it several times a day, all day for peak a boo and to watch himself sing, dance, and play. Just expect to buy your own command strips to adhere it.",

This is not a true mirror, meaning it is flexible and will reflect a fun-house mirror effect that gets worse as you back away from it. However, at 2-3' away, this is not bothersome. I read complaints about the mirror's lack of adhesiveness. So, I peeled off the adhesive backing paper and than papered over the adhesive (basically blocking it). I used double-sized velcro tape along the left and right sides to attach it. I blocked the adhesive to prevent it from attracting dust and bugs. This worked well. The mirror is not going anywhere. Unless it want it to.",

                "reviewText": "Cleaned the wall thoroughly with rubbing alcohol. Stuck it on. Twice. It kept falling within 24 hours, no pulling or anything, just literally falling off the wall. Eventually it fell onto my linoleum floor and stuck to it! I had to rip it off, and it left glue behind. It's a complete mess that I'm now struggling to remove from my floor. Threw this thing straight into the garbage. The mirror quality was fine, but you're better off paying $12 for an actual acrylic mirror and hanging it with command strips than dealing with this mess.",
