                "reviewText": "I bought two 24 packs of the 12\"x14\" mirror tiles for my home gym project, which gave me an 8' wide x 5' tall mirror. It's not perfect (pros and cons below), but I still love it and am very satisfied with this purchase!Pros: 1) I love that I was able to build a giant mirror for only about $180 (after buying 3m Command Strips as an alternative installation option). 2) Easy and cheap shipping (they come in a very small box). 3) Easy install (with 3m Command Strips you can remove the tiles and put them back up as many times as needed to get it perfect). 4) Modular and scalable you can set them up in any configuration or shape you want and expand/add more later. 5) If you move to a new place, you can take them with you (just buy more Command Strips). 6) The tiles look like real mirrors. 7) Speedy delivery.Cons: 1) Distorted image or gaps between tiles. If you put them right up against eachother the cracks distort the image. If you put a small gap between them it looks better but then you have tiny gaps. With the 3m Command Strips, I was able to do lots of trial and error to get the most seamless mirror possible, but it's still not absolutely perfect. 2) The sticky stuff they provide (glue and double sided sticky foam) will ruin a wall if you need to remove them (see other reviews). This is where the 3m Command Strips come in. I got the \"small\" size and cut them in half, putting one in each corner of every tile, and haven't had a single issue. These added about $40 to my total project cost, but is well worth it for the ease of installation, removal and moveability.All in all, I would go this route again if I ever have to set up another home gym on a budget. It is a very affordable and easy way to have a huge mirror. You just have to decide if you want small gaps between tiles or a fun house effect along the edges, which still beats spending a thousand dollars on a giant heavy mirror in my opinion. I went with the funhouse option, but it doesn't bother me when I think about how much money I saved.",

                "reviewText": "One of the mirrors is warped but you can only see it from far away. The instructions stated they will come out warped if your walls are uneven but my wall looked pretty even so I don't know. A tip for hanging the squares up straight, measure up from the floor how high you want it on both bottom corners, and use a pencil to outline each bottom corner. I hung them 1 centimeter apart and I like the way it looks. Even if you put them together you can see the seam so I think it looks more intentional this way. It beats a flimsy body mirror from walmart in my opinion and it's about the same price.",
