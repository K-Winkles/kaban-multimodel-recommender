The details prove curious -- not only are the bodies savaged way beyond anything found at a normal murder scene, every mirror in the house has been shattered. The spectacle shocks a peaceful island community, and when local police turn to the FBI for assistance, Agent Violet Darger finds herself working another harrowing crime scene. She stares, once more, into the abyss, and mankind's warped reflection stares back. Read more",

Vargus and Tim McBain have it down when it comes to delivering the goods.If you have never read anything by these authors, you could do worse than start here, especially at just 99p.",
