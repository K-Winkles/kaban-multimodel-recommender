Putting it together was really easy and it seems pretty sturdy. The regular magnification side of the mirror is great. However the magnified side is super wonky - it is extremely distorted and I doubt is what magnification claimed here. It works great for my purposes, as I didn't plan to use the magnified side anyway, but if that is important to you, I'd look elsewhere.",

The 10x magnification is a lot more than I expected, I can see every eyelash and pore. Great for those who are visually impaired to be able to see to apply makeup. It was easy to put together and had no blemishes or scratches. The base is heavy enough to support the mirror and there is no risk of it tipping over. Comes with stick on non-slip pads for the bottom, and they do work to stop the mirror from sliding around my counter. It looks quite nice on my vanity, and I'm very happy with it!",

The light is both bright and not blinding so you can actually see your face. You also get a longer than normal usb cable which reaches out outlet near our sink. Seems like a really well made product. Maybe the only minor gripe is that the power button is on the mirror surface itself, would be nicer if that power button was on the base, as you will most likely end up getting finger prints on your mirror as time goes by, leading to more cleaning.",

When assembled, it stands robustly on a desk. All pieces, including the base and the stem, are quite solid. Its height seems perfect for most situations, and the swivel top allows you to adjust your view.The mirror is just the right size, large enough to view your face. Having two sides, one with a regular mirror and one with 10x magnification is perfect. As the mirror size is large, the 10x magnification side also gives you a clear view, something you don't get with small mirrors and high magnification factors.Overall it is a great desktop makeup mirror. The only thing missing is a circular LED light source on its rims, otherwise it would have been perfect. If you don't need extra light, I strongly recommend it.",
