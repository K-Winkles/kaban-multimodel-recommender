                "reviewText": "I'm not a fan of short stories, but I just do not have the will power to pass up the opportunity to read, yet again, one of Agatha Christie's books....long or short! I love the humor that the rather pompous little Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, provides for the reader as he meticulously solves crimes. He is a bit unorthodox in his conclusions and does not give up until he solves his case. In this adventure Poirot receives a note requesting his presence at a time to be later disclosed. Who is this gentleman and why does he need the services of the great and famous Poirot? He is a bit put-off by the order; however, his curiosity takes over when he asks an acquaintance about the writer of the note. He is told the old gent is somewhat egotistical and a bit mad. Well, that piques Poirot's curiosity, and he decides that he will abide by the summons. He arrives at dinner time, but the guests seem quite surprised to have a stranger in their midst. But where is the gentleman who summoned the great little detective to his home? Keep your little gray cells busy and follow along with the great detective and see if you can solve the crime before Poirot. If one is an Agatha Christie fan, then this will be an enjoyable read; however, if one is looking for modern day blood, gore and mutilation scenes this will not measure up to those expectations. I love Ms. Christie's mysteries because they include a bit of suspense, mystery, humor and are just plain fun to read.",

                "reviewText": "\u201cMurder in the Mews\u201d is one of my personal favorite Christie short story. Without giving away the solution I will say that this is a great example of misdirection and originality one expects from Christie. \u201cThe Incredible Theft\u201d is not on the par with Christie\u2019s best works, but still is an above-average piece. \u201cDead Man\u2019s Mirror\u201d is basically an expanded rework of her earlier short story \u201cThe Second Gong\u201d. \u201cTriangle at Rhodes\u201d is a good example of a terrific short story: exotic location, interesting characters, and a fine prose. That notwithstanding it reads more like a Miss Marple story than a Poirot mystery: the solution involves \u201cthis person reminds me of such-and- such criminal from the past\u201d rather than specific clues, and the ending is a bit of a disappointment. I would get this book for the title story which is one of Christie\u2019s finest.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Four excellent Poirot novellas from Christie's prime",
                "reviewText": "Here is the opening sentence of one of the four novellas included in this collection: \"As the butler handed round the souffl\u00e9, Lord Mayfield leaned confidentially toward his neighbour on the right, Lady Julia Carrington.\" Right away, you know you are in prime Agatha Christie country: The British Empire is at its height and some of the aristocracy have gathered at a country estate where mystery and intrigue are sure to break out. This collection was first published in 1938. My favorite Christie's are from this period from the mid-1920s through the mid-1940s when she was at her best as a writer and before the dreariness of postwar Britain had overcome the Empire, country estates, and the aristocracy.All four of these novellas are quite good; two are even locked-room murders. Overall, I much prefer the Poirot novels to the short stories. The short stories provide insufficient space for much character development or much time for Poirot to fully display his deductive abilities. These novellas, however, are long enough to avoid the shortcomings of the short stories. If you are new to Christie, this collection -- while not quite as good as her best novels -- is not a bad place to start. If you are a Christie fan, then you pretty much know what you are getting.This collection has also been published under the title, \"Dead Man's Mirror.\" These new Harper paperback editions are quite nicely done. They can be read easily without breaking their spines and should hold up to multiple rereadings. Because they retain British spellings, I assume that they follow the text of the original British editions.",
