Both Mirrors (the main mirror and the 10x round add on mirror) are very nice distortion free glass and provide very sharp reflections.This arrived in a high quality box packaged very well in bubble wrap with a micro USB charging cord and instruction book. The 10x close up mirror has two suction cups on it so you can move it as necessary. There is a physical on/off switch on the back near the micro USB charging port and charge indicator light. The lid/stand has a magnet in it that keeps the lid shut tight when closed. The border of the mirror lights up in a very uniform/continuous manner and provides a nice boost of light for when using the mirror. The base folds to cover the mirror for protection when not in use. The glass mirror is slightly recessed so when closed, the glass does not get touched by the base. Our mirror came with some charge in the battery and lasted a while before we needed to actually charge it. It has been in use for a few weeks and lasts several days between charges.",

I've been using this in my \"cloffice\", since I don't have a vanity, and it's been really useful. So far, I've traveled with it twice, and it's super lightweight. Bonus points for the charger being a USB!",

My only concern is the size of the 10x small mirror that attaches well via suction cups. I feel that the small magnifying mirror could have been slightly larger. I wanted a magnifying mirror for hands-free eye makeup application. I have not used it as yet, so we shall see if the small mirror is adequate.",
