I can feel the results already, after just 3 half hour sessions. Best of all, OUR AMAZON DRIVER DELIVERED IT TO THE FRONT DOOR DESPITE THE HEAVY SNOW AND TREACHEROUS ICY ROADS. It does make a loud clicking noise in operation. The instructions just says it tells you 'distance', not what measure of distance. I had pedaled for 38 minutes at resistance 2, distance said 2.6. I assumed that meant miles. Called customer service for info, customer service rep ( with a very heavy Asian accent) said distance meant inches. 38 minutes to go 2.6 inches? Nonsense. It must mean miles. Customer service rep clearly does not understand English.",

I choose this because it\u2019s the lightest under the desk elliptical that I can find. Purpose is to move around easily. For the resistance level, it is not as strong as Deskcycle Ellipse, which I bought it for home use.As for the quietness, one has to make sure the wheels are clear from any dirt e.g. small sticker, that itself could create unwanted sound.Overall, \ud83d\udc4d.",

                "reviewText": "This is replacement #3 for the \u2018perfect\u2019 under-desk elliptical that suffered an unfortunate and fatal miscommunication.For my needs, size is of paramount importance. This is a very compact model and fits beautifully into the limited space under my desk.It is quite light. I have it seated on a foam mat on a vinyl floor. Unfortunately, it\u2019s lack of heft means that it travels more than I would like. It does, however, come with reversible foot pads for carpet or flooring. If I forgo the mat and flip the feet, I will likely resolve this issue. Given the likelyhood that local dust and dog hair will render the stickiness of the \u2018floor\u2019 version of the foot pads useless in short order, I am not quite ready to go there yet.There is not a considerable difference between settings 1 and 8. I have used an elliptical under my desk for many years, so I may actually have achieved such benefit as to not notice what a novice might. I have it set on the 8th level of resistance and would liken it to that of a 13 year old daughter: I can feel the burn after a few minutes, but it\u2019s not yet painful.What is quite different from models 0 thru 2 is the angle of the pedals. They are closer to a solid 45* as opposed to the lesser 30* of the others. I am finding this to be quite stressful on both shins and calves, but am very much enjoying the increase in stretch.The only non-resolvable issue with this unit is the scant heel guard on the pedals. The curve of my shoe is higher than the lip at the back of each pedal and my feet tend to slip off regularly.Alas, I will either simply attach a small block to the back of each pedal to keep my heels in check, or develop the (currently flaming) thigh muscles to adapt. Time will tell.All in all, unless I ever manage to find an available model #0 to replace the original perfection, this is the keeper.",
