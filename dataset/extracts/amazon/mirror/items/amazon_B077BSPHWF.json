But for the price this intro Smart Mirror is what I paid for. I purposely wanted to see if they were worth getting to replace my echos and eventually I will. The no touch screen feature is a miss though. Begginers perfect. If you are tech savvy not for you perhaps. Also if you are not good figuring things out on your own not for you ~",

Next train some stations will not be recognised. I have sent a email and as of 10th November 2019 not heard anything. I brought the app so I can get the news headlines as the free app does not allow. So buying the app the other parts need to be fixed",
