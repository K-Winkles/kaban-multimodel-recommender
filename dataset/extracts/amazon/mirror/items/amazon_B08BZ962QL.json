The film is difficult to remove from front of these tiles causing half of them to crack in my experience. When I was able to get some of them hung, I got finger prints on the mirror and I thought that it was totally normal. When I attempted to clean with a microfiber cloth, it scratched the mirrors. I then sprayed some windex on them which did absolutely nothing to the scratches. I now have an area with 9 mirror tiles hung and it now looks like a distorted mirror found at a circus. Totally trash and I now cannot return them. DO NOT BUY!!",

                "reviewText": "My apartment has these dirty mirror doors covered with glass so there was no way to clean it. I wanted a simple temporary solution. These were very easy to apply and look clear up close. Yes, from father away it gets a little distorted but you can hardly tell. I think applying it to a smooth surface yields better results. Been up for almost 3 months and still look great. Worth the money for me.",

I would say they are definitely not worth the 22 dollars I paid for them.",
