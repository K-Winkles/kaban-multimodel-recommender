                "reviewText": "TL;DR stunning, durable, well packaged, works as expected, defogger doesnt cover 100% of mirror,Install:1st, im an electrician so powering the mirror was simple for me. All it needs is a standard plug. I actually installed a recessed outlet (aka clock outlet) so the mirror and sit more flush on the wall. BUT! they out-smarted me! and the mirror was built with a 90degree flat plug so it already sits flush against the wall! so no need for an special outlet, just a basic one works perfectly fine (keep in mind tho, if its going in a bathroom the outlet should be gfci protected per electrical code and general safety)It came with 2 mounting brackets (Z brackets) made of metal that are fastest to the wall with 2 screws each. also came with screws and drywall anchors. but throw away the anchors and screw it directly into the stud with some construction screws or lag screws (not drywall screws!) the mirror lays into the brackets and you may have to push down on the mirror a little bit to feel/hear it set in place, it doesnt have to be perfect the first time the mirror will slide of the brackets with a solid push.and thats it. super simple install.Controls:the touch buttons work perfectly, I was wearing nitrile gloves and they work with those on. (it came with white gloves too, but i didnt notice until after install)When the controls are blue, that means its off.when the main light is off, a long press and hold does something, I think locks the light off.long press and hold with the lights on is the dimming function.short press, cycles thru the light settings.I dont remember if the mirror has a memory setting, as in itll go back to its last setting after its been turned off. I think the RGBs do, but not the mirror light.Defogger:it works better than others ive had in the past, its super fast and does a really good job.BUT! it does not do the entire light, I got the 55x30 and it does the center about 24x12 ish inches worth, its enough to be usable, so not really a complaint.RGBsI leave it on the chasing effect even as a night light, its very calming to me personally. if you stare long enough you'll see each individual led. its really not a problem nor a design flaw, ive just been spoiled by my job to see perfectly uniform smooth leds without the led itself being noticable. the rgbs also dim, thats pretty rad.main light:there are 3 color temps: white, yellow, and more white. personally I can't really tell the difference between the 2 whites, but I think thats cuz of the order it cycles thru the colors so its hard to compare. either way its a nice white that really shows how handsome or ugly i am that day.Cleaning:Ive only had it for a few days so haven't needed to clean it just yet, but I suspect itll be just as any other light.what i have noticed is, it doesn't seem to collect fingerprints that much. so thats huge!Packaging:this thing was well protected. It even had big thick rub conor guards on it! totally keeping those for future use for anything. the front and back had a layer of foam along with foam around the edges.I absolutely love it",

It not as heavy once out of the box.It took only about 15 minutes to install and adds another great addition to our bathroom. I ordered two one for each of my bathrooms. Only installed one so far. The other bathroom is being remodeled.The price was great at $229.00 on sale from $309.00. Worth every penny. The switches built into the mirror have a soft blue glow and almost acts as a night light while off.If you thinking about getting one, get it! It will add a little elegance to your bathroom.",

                "reviewText": "I can\u2019t speak on the longevity of the mirror but i can however speak on the quality in which it was received, how it looks, and how install went.I was nervous when it was shipped out from the company as it is a big glass mirror and you never know how companies are going to pack a product (especially a mirror). It had bulky rubber bumpers on all 4 corners and styrofoam molds all around the face and corners of the mirror and it was in perfect condition upon delivery.I love how it has made our bathroom look a bit more updated vs the typical glue-on-the-wall mirror that most builders use in homes. All the colors look amazing and the lights are very responsive!Install was as easy as measure, drill 4 holes, shove in drywall anchors, screw 4 bolts into the 2 brackets, pick it up and lay it on the tracks. EXTREMELY SIMPLE AND ANYBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TO INSTALL THIS IN 30 MINUTES TOPS!",

Despite all this, it is a great mirror. I\u2019m still installing in the vanity area so I haven\u2019t removed the plastic from the mirror. However, i did peak and it\u2019s a very clear mirror.

                "reviewText": "Well packaged, super fast delivery and an ease to install (I hardwired it). The touch controls are sensitive and easy to figure out. I had gone with another brand that had issues. The only slight quality issue is the holes drilled into the wall mounts are haphazard. Not enough to outweigh all the great features. It is bright enough to be highly functional! It really livened up my main bathroom (along w a floating vanity). Towels bars being changed out as we speak.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars 55x36\u201d RGB Mirror",
                "reviewText": "Ordered this after researching for several days. The mirror arrived in 3 days! It looks gorgeous! We wired it up to a switched outlet. The mirror has enough space behind it that a recessed outlet is not necessary, the plug is a right angle plug. I like that the front and rear lights are controlled independently by two separate buttons- I don\u2019t think their plain white light model has this feature. Both front and rear lights can be dimmed. The front light is only the three shades of white. The mirror is fairly bright but we will need to add several more lights in a 6x12\u2019 bathroom. I don\u2019t like that the defogger comes on automatically every time the wall switch is turned on-the manufacturer should change this to default off as the defogger is only used when showering. We will most likely need to leave the wall switch on 24/7 to alleviate this, but a wall switch gives that flexibility. The 3 blue lights make a good bathroom nightlight. It is not terribly heavy to install but is very awkward trying to hang it two feet in front of your body over a vanity and requires two people. I wish it had a clock feature. LOAAO did many things right on this mirror and we love it.",
