                "reviewText": "oruii Round Mirror: $51.99 at the time of reviewWhen I sat down to write the review for this mirror, it seemed kind of silly. After all, what is there to say about a mirror? It's reflective, uh, it's\u2026 Big enough for the space? But even mirrors need reviews so here I am. My wife and I recently remodeled all three bathrooms in our house (not at the same time thank goodness). We already had a mirror for one of the bathrooms, but we needed another two. We couldn't find a matching mirror for the existing one we had and our basement bathroom was done first. So I set out defined the mirror that fit that aesthetic.I landed on this mirror from Oruii because I liked the simple black framed circular design. I needed something big, but not too big (in this case I settled on the 24\" x 24\"). This mirror also checked that box. And last but not least, I wanted a glass mirror (as opposed to plastic).I am happy to report that this mirror looks great! The thin black frame does a great job of accenting the edge of the mirror. The aluminum material helps keep the way down too. It has a nice easy to use hanger built into the back with angular guides that help lead whatever nail or hanging tool of choice right into the center hole. There is also a small foam square down towards the bottom to help even out the bottom side of the mirror so it sits flat against the wall.Really the only nitpick I have is very difficult to avoid. The aluminum frame does have a very small separation point at the bottom where it's clear that one strip of aluminum was bent around the mirror. Unfortunately, it's pretty easy to see. That having been said, it is pretty small, and I doubt that our guests notice it (even if I see it every day).Ultimately, I think this is a fantastic mirror for the price. Right around 50 bucks for a 24 inch circular mirror with a nice stylish black band around it? Yes, please! If I could give partial stars, this would probably get 4.75 stars. But since I can't, and I'm not willing to round down for that tiny little nitpick, this is gonna end up at five stars out of five for me. Not only what I order it again, we did order another one for our other bathroom. It looks great in there, too!",

There's like a \"slit\"- I guess I'd call it- on the very side which is visible when you walk into my apartment. I really love the mirror and it's ALMOST perfect.**UPDATE** Seller reached out to me about the damaged mirror and we came to a resolution. Great customer service on their end, hence the 5 star rating.**ANOTHER UPDATE** Seller requested I put another photo of the mirror on the wall. Although it is a beautiful mirror, I feel I need to point out that the \"sticky pad\" in fact doesn't stick. Also, unfortunately, the bottom portion of my mirror is warped- I have photos of it but I have family members in it so I won't put the on here even with a blur effect. (Also- excuse my incomplete entryway table)",
