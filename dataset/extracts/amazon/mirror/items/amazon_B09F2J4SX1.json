At that first thought was small, but the size is perfect , and easy to pack for travel and the lighting is bright which really good, you won't get outside in the light and see that make up is too light or dark or uneven. which is a big plus , my regular lightning in my bathroom is to dim. And 10x mirror is also nice to have, if someone can't see without their glasses, you can use it and not need your glasses. So that would be a bonus for you.",

                "reviewText": "This mirror is just okay for the price. It isn\u2019t bright enough for makeup application and the little, round magnification mirror is useless. It\u2019s too small and covers the other part of the mirror when you move it. The suction is kind of useless. You end up smudging the mirror when you pry off the the circle mirror. The quality is what I expected for the money. Plastic and somewhat flimsy. It feels like it would break into pieces if I dropped it. I\u2019m sorry I gave my old mirror away. I will use this one until I get my money\u2019s worth out of it. If I had to apply makeup every day with this mirror I would send it back, but it\u2019s not worth packing and returning.",

Got ahold of their customer service by email and they sent out a new one immediately, wasn't expecting that!! This one works just as it should and the love how you can adjust the lighting so it's perfect. I normally don't leave reviews but I had to since good customer service is hard to come by these days and the product exceeded my expectations. Will have to see what other things they make, I'll buy from them again.",

The only thing is it sometimes comes off the oval stand that holds it up but it\u2019s meant to come off and on and I am sort of rough with it sometimes. I love all of the different magnifications and I touch button! Very nice. Only thing is that it DRAINS through batteries so quickly but I just plug it up to a portable charger or plug it in the wall and it works awesome.",

The magnetized sections are great for when I need close-ups while doing my eyeliner or parting my hair for braids. Haven't used the 10x suction mirror because I don't think I really need it but it's still good to have just in case. The packaging for the mirror is also real cute. Been using this mirror for months and I love it! Definitely worth it!",
