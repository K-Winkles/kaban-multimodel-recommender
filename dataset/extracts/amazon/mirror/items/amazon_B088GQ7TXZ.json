These are both 10x and 20x. I used the 20 and found it very helpful for tweezing my eyebrows as well as cleaning my face. I wasn't planning on using the tweezers but to my surprise they are very good little tweezers. I was able to get my brows smooth and tamed without damaging my skin or causing irritation.The suction cups are a little tricky. You put them into the recessed slot closest to the outer edge of the mirror. Then you press down and push the cups toward the inside of the mirror until it clicks into place. If you don't do this they will fall right out! Once they are in place they stay there and have a very firm grip. Overall I love these. They do their job and the price point can't be beat. A really great purchase.",

Second one fell off yesterday. Tried to put it back up as it wasn't damaged - and the suction cups will NOT work. So now I'm either buying a 3rd mirror, or just finding the suction cups. Really do like the mirror - the suction cups need serious improvement.",

                "reviewText": "Your eyeball literally has to be about 1\" away from the very center of the mirror to see clearly, but then whatever you're focusing your vision on is not in the center of the mirror and appears a bit blurry to your eye. This pretty much defeats the purpose of the mirror since you cannot ever put the thing you're trying to focus on in the center for clarity AND see it fully clearly.Also, you clearly can't fit a pair of tweezers, held at an angle to your face, or a makeup brush or applicator or anything in your hand between the mirror and your face when your eyeball is 1\" away from the dish. So, this is only good for looking at your eyeball itself without needing to do anything else at the same time as observing your eyeball.Mine arrived without any suction cups in the plastic form-fitted tray where 4 pieces clearly belonged, so I cannot hang them until I get that figured out. Pretty useless. The mirrors do *work,* but, only in the sense that \"they magnify and aren't broken,\" not in the sense that you can use them to observe yourself anywhere but the pupil of the eyeball you're looking out of.",
