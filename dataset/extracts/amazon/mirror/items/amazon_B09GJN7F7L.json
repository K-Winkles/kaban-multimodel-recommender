Like i still used my heavy duty self drilling anchor, and put one screw into a stud, but i saved the one the mirror came with.Also, its cute! Fit my monochome clean aesthetic well. Id recommend it!

It\u2019s easy to hang, but the holes have to be exactly lined up. I made a template using painters tape, marking where the holes would be with a sharpie. I then transferred the painters tape to the wall, and made sure the marks were level. Drilled right through the marks to add my anchors.Like always, I tossed out the anchors that were included - they are the garbage ones with rounded plastic tips. They always bend and are not very sturdy. I used self-drilling anchors from the hardware store and the screws included with the mirror. Attached pic of the anchor type I always use.",
