The highest setting for brightness is bright enough for me.It comes with a USB charging cable, but no block (we all have many of these).It also comes with small, round-tip, scissors.The three suction cups for holding it to the mirror work well. Be careful when pulling it off the mirror so that you don't rip the silicone cups. Do one cup at a time and it will be fine.My only gripe is that there is not an auto shutoff for the light and just a light touch on the button while putting it away (I store it in its box) will turn it on. So, be careful or you'll have to recharge the battery. If you always keep it mounted on the mirror, this won't be an issue for you.Overall, 4 stars from me.",

I always find it really difficult to find a mirror to tweeze my eyebrows when traveling. My eyesight isn\u2019t what it used to be and standard hotel mirrors don\u2019t cut it. I\u2019ve tried other travel mirrors and found a variety of issues with them. They\u2019re typically too short, too low or just difficult to use. I\u2019m really happy to have found this mirror because it has suction cups on it and I can just stick it to a hotel mirror. I also have a make up case that has a mirror on it but no magnification and I can stick this to that. 30x mag is going to show you EVERYTHING.
