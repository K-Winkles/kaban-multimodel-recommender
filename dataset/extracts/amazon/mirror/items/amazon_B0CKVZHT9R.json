I hate having to put makeup on and fix my hair in the bathroom with the horrible lighting and steam, so I am thrilled that I can do everything at my locker after I work out.I love that this mirror takes AAA batteries. The bottom line is that batteries last so much longer than charging. Plus, I don't want to have to charge the mirror every few days, and I doubt it would be this bright after charging. Seriously, this light is BRIGHT!! It has three settings, and they're all bright, but my favorite is the warm light. It is very flattering. The mirror is also lightweight, so I'm not afraid the hook will unstick, and the mirror will come crashing down in my locker.Overall, this is a great mirror; it's a good size, and the handle makes it easy to hold, or you can do what I did and hang it from a hook. But I promise you, the brightness of the light will make it all worth it!",

                "reviewText": "Here\u2019s a versatile high quality plastic mirror that can hang from a hook or nail, or be handheld. It\u2019s the size you can put your make up on or fix your hair. The lights are wonderful. I was shocked that 4 AAA batteries could fit in the handle but they do. It was easy to open and close the battery cover, which these aging hands appreciate.The lights are bright and you can adjust it from super bright to softer and warmer. This is a very well constructed mirror! I wish it came with a layer of protection, like a cloth bag.",

I went straight to Amazon and was pleased to find this one that even has a light all the way around the edge. We dug up four AAA batteries (always have plenty of batteries on hand) and installed them in the handle, pressed the button and \"Voila!\" - it works. My wife loves this one and we'll definitely pack it a little better on future trips.",

I\u2019ve Never Seen An Handheld Mirror Have An LED Light On It So I Was Excited About That, It\u2019s Very Lightweight, Convenient, And Portable. This Mirror Does Take 4 Triple A Batteries So Keep That In Mind. It Has A Hook On The Bottom Of The Handle So You Can Hook It In The Shower Or Wherever You Want It. The Size Of The Mirror Is Also Great, I Love That It\u2019s Wide So You Can See Everything! Overall 10/10",
