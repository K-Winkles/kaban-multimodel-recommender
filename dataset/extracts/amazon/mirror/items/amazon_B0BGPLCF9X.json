While still out of country I contacted the seller they were very to get back with me I told them the problem & they suggested charging the mirror I did not receive any charging cord with purchase, nor did I have one they would fit with me on my trip. I emailed company to let them know & they said they would send me a replacement mirror, I received today. Great customer service!!",
