                "reviewText": "I used the mirrors for our camper as they are plastic, highly reflective and easy to use without worrying about breakage traveling down the road. NOTE: I added my OWN border tape!To do that, I laid three pieces face down on a flat surface, taped the back together joining the three pieces, then used MY tape (not included) to add a border. Then they were easily mounted to the trailer cabinet doors with the two-sided sticker pads. With the extra two pieces (I bought an 8 pack), I bordered those with my tape and mounted to either side of our slide that does not have side windows, to bring more light in.Note, I held up a cup in different places so you could see the reflection and also included a picture of the cup where the two pieces of glass came together. No distortion!Also, as I couldn't find the sticky tape on my first look in the package, I contacted customer support and they responded quickly and were very accommodating. Highly recommend purchasing from this company.",

                "reviewText": "Only useful if you want to use one, and I'd give a star or two more for that if the advertising didn't show them functioning the way I wanted them to. They do NOT create an image as shown when placed together due to slight warping of each. You'll just be totally disjointed. As one standalone mirror, it's fine. You'll never get it off your wall though.I found the adhesive is insane. These totally damaged my walls despite my care in trying to remove them various ways.And to try to return them, I couldn't get the adhesive off the back of half of the mirrors either. If you manage to get enough fingernail under it, pull it very very very slowly (a ton of trialling in other ways: floss, alcohol, goo gone) you might be able to remove it in nearly once piece. Hours later, just so over it!I was dumb and tried to make the mirror before evaluating a couple pieces. Therefore, I salvaged 8 of these enough to return, the other 8 totally damaged in trying to clean/remove them.These were scratched by a sponge while trying to wipe them clean of fingerprints, even just a dusting.Just buy the mirror, unless it's a safety thing. Your time and frustration is worth the money for a decent mirror experience. Amazon has all kinds of great deals on bigger real mirrors.",
