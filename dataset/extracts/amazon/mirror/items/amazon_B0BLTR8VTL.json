                "reviewText": "58\"\u00d718\" Arched Full Length Mirror Arched with StandI just finished mounting this mirror and overall I\u2019m super impressed with the quality, especially for a mirror under $100 (I got it for $69).Pros:\u2022 As stated above, a great price!\u2022 It was well packed with a combination of \u00bd\u201d and \u00be\u201d rigid foam all around with plywood reinforced ends. It arrived in mint condition in two days with Prime shipping.\u2022 The frame is made of square aluminum tubing and is very rigid.\u2022 The \u2018fun house\u2019 mirror effect that some complain about was only observable when I stood half way across the room, focused on a single object (table lamp) and moved slowly from side to side. Honestly, if I wasn\u2019t looking for it I wouldn\u2019t have picked up on the minimal distortion (certainly not enough to move this comment to the Cons section\u2022 The stand was fully assembled and recessed into the frame to allow me to leave it in place and still mount flat to the wall.Cons:\u2022 It was listed as 18\u201dx58\u201d but it was closer to 17 \u00bc\u201d W by just short of 58\u201dL.\u2022 The mounting brackets are heavy duty but unfortunately they are a rigid key-hole-slot design with no room for mounting measurement errors. Typical, brackets have an adjustable triangular piece of heavy metal at the top of each wall mounting point and allow for some degree of inaccuracy in width spacing between the brackets. Not these puppies. Be sure your measurements are accurate down to the 16th inch (see tip below).\u2022 Speaking of the brackets, they were attached with a 1/8\u201d difference in height (bottom to top). I needed to adjust the wall anker for different heights to compensate.Installation Tip:\u2022 Reuse a long piece of the shipping plywood to make a template for the screw holes. This will save you from having a crooked mirror or patching drywall.\u2022 Layout the spacing exactly as you think you will on the wall. If you need to adjust one of the screws vertically to compensate for different bracket heights, this is the place to do it before drilling into the wall in the wrong place.\u2022 Drill 1/8\u201d holes in the plywood exactly where the screws will be located and inert them almost completely into the template.\u2022 Flip the template over and slide the screw heads onto the frame brackets to see if you got all of the spacing right. I measured from the frame bottom to the mounted template.\u2022 When it fits correctly. Back out the screws until the tips just barely protrude from the wood.\u2022 Using a level against the wood strip and with the screw tips lightly touching the wall, position the template where you want to drill holes and tap it to mark screw hole locations in the drywall. Drill \u00bc\u201d holes in the drywall for the ankers, insert screws almost all the way into the ankers and hang you new mirror.\u2022 Because the brackets are on the rear edges of the frame it will be no problem seeing both the screw and bracket from the sides to mount.",

                "reviewText": "The mirror is beautiful, and the reflection is really good. No distortion/waviness. Frame is ok, although the paint has already started to fade after only 2-3 cleanings/wipes with a gentle cleaning pad and water. I like the size and otherwise it seems well made. I like the hanging hooks as well, in case you want it on the wall.My main issue with it is the way in which the back stand is attached to the frame. It seems like a really stupid design flaw -- the pivot bolt is very close to the back of the mirror, which is unprotected glass. As a result, when you extend the stand, there is a little bit of extra metal material above the pivot which scrapes the back of the mirror. I noticed where it touches, it has already scraped off a small part of the reflective amalgam on the back of the mirror. You can see two little damage black spots on the front. Very small, but annoying because this is just an elementary design flaw. It's does not appear to be faulty or broken, this is the actual design.You can unscrew the base and 'reverse' the brackets so that it still works without scraping the glass, or you can just remove it and hang/lean it.I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for that minor issue. Not worth returning since the damage is small (most people would probably not even notice it), and the new one would likely have the same issue.",
