                "reviewText": "What a well made, attractive mirror this turned out to be! My husband installed it a few days ago in the dressing area of a beach condo we're part owners in. He was impressed by its quality and commented on how classy it looked with its beveled edge. I was concerned about how heavy it might be, and it needed to fit close to the wall. It's not particularly heavy, and it's close enough to the wall so that when the door to the linen closet is opened there is no danger of the door banging against the mirror. (Distance is maintained by the door knob.) I shopped extensively on line for a suitable mirror and was often amazed at the prices being charged. Now I've seen this mirror and the quality of it I'm amazed at what an excellent value it is!!! The folks who own the company did email me encouraging me to supply product feedback, explaining that theirs is a small company, and they'd really appreciate it. It was nice to receive such a personalized email and discover I wasn't getting something from China. From the packaging to the product itself you can tell you've bought something from people who really care about what they produce.",

                "reviewText": "When I first installed the mirrors, they looked great. I liked the floating effect.However, at 1 o'clock in the morning we heard a loud crash and the mirror fell off the wall leaving a chip in my quartz counter top and a crack my porcelain tile floor. The floating bracket stayed on the wall but glue used to hold the bracket to the mirror came apart. I contacted Fab Glass and was told the bracket was not glued to the mirror properly and I was sent a new set of mirrors.Upon inspecting the new set, it looked like it was glued the same. I called Fab Glass and sent photos to them. They told me to try and pry the bracket off the back of the mirror to prove that it would not come off. I did, and with very little effort, the bracket came off the back of the mirror.I requested a refund because I did not want to take a chance on them falling off the wall again, especially with one of my family members standing in front of the mirror.To this day I have not received a refund. I was lucky the kids were not standing in front of the mirror when it fell off. STAY AWAY FROM THESE MIRRORS !",

The mirror is very sturdy and nicely beveled; we just repainted our guest bath and needed a relatively large mirror because of the high ceilings, it was very easy to hang, I am a small woman, and I hung it by myself while standing on a 3 step step stool..it already has the hanging hardware on the back to hang it vertical or horizontal, I did add picture hanging wire to the back of it to hang it, I find it is easier hanging heavy things in this manner. Every time I pass our newly done bath, I look inside to marvel at how well the mirror goes beautifully in the bathroom. Would highly recommend this mirror.",
