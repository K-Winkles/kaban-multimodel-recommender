                "reviewText": "I'd always thought shower mirrors were an unnecessary luxury. For several decades I've been shaving at the sink or creek, then hopping into the shower/bath to rinse off. It was a simple process that seemed to work well.On a whim, I decided to try this inexpensive shower mirror. I'm glad I did!I'm notoriously horrible at visualizing measurements and was (as usual) shocked by the size of this mirror. I'd been expecting a small handheld mirror (maybe 6\"x4\"?) and the larger format (as advertised - slightly over 8\"x10\") was awesome!The mirror includes a sticky-hook to affix on the shower wall, allowing the mirror to hang, perfectly balanced, from a hole in the top of the mirror. I hung it at eye-level (probably the only mirror in the house I can see into without crouching down!) and hopped in the shower with my shaving accessories.This fog-free factor was cool! I'm not sure why I'd never considered this a \"need\" - being able to clearly see in the mirror despite steam and water droplets was amazing! I don't know if the mirror also magnifies or if i was just standing closer than I can the sink mirror, but I was able to get a great shave and could see very well every terrible detail of my face.This mirror does more than it advertises and is sold at a fair price. Highly recommended!",

It IS a real mirror.Since this is so lightweight it could easily be used as a hand held mirror too. And because it's not made of glass it's much safer. I'm wondering whether that super clear surface will last though, especially since the typical bathroom steam will probably need to be cleaned off. Time will tell, but even if it has to be replaced every few years, these are not so expensive. This is a nice simple product and is going to be useful.",

The size of the mirror is perfect, and the circular hole for hanging on the hook adds to its convenience. It's worth noting that these mirrors are not fogless as advertised, but wiping the fog off is an easy fix. The lightweight plastic construction is a plus, as it eliminates the worry of glass shards in case of a fall. Additionally, removing the protective film that the mirrors are shipped with is essential, as it significantly enhances the clarity of the mirror. However, due to the misleading fog-free claim in the advertisement, I have deducted one star from my rating.---Product: quegau Shatterproof Shower Mirror Shaving Mirror for Shower,Unbreakable Wall Mirror,10.7x8 in, Plexiglass Makeup Mirror,Largest Bathroom Wall Hanging,Handheld Camping Mirror 35ASIN: B0CL8ZZH1L",

It works perfectly for what it is, the hook has stayed up with the weight of the mirror so far and I like that it is metal, and after warming it up for a few seconds under the water stream at the start of a shower the mirror has stayed un-foggy throughout the rest. There were two layers of protective plastic on the font and one on the back, so make sure you get them all when unpackaging, when I pealed off the first layer I thought the mirror was scratched but found the second a little later and the finish was perfect.",

                "reviewText": "This is your basic plastic mirror with a hole in it and a hook with a sticky back. LIghtweight and not much to it but for me, it works fine. Had no problem getting it to stick to a tile in my shower and so far, it's stayed fog free. The mirror is clear and undistorted and is exactly what I needed to shave in the shower. I already have a place to keep my razor so the latk of a razor holder or anything else was unimportant to me. If you need a simple shaving mirror for your shower, this should work fine for you.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very large mirror and has a great mirrored surface. And I love that it won\u2019t break if I drop it. Although this is clearly a mirror meant for a shower or to hang somewhere, I got it so that I could look at my back and side view of my shoulders and shoulder blades in the wall mirror of my exercise room. I have been given a bunch of exercises in physical therapy and need to make sure my shoulder blades are flat. This mirror is perfect for this purpose. But when I\u2019ve accomplished this goal, I will put this mirror in the bathroom.",

Also, love that you can remove it from fixed hook and use it elsewhere. I've used it to just look at the back of my head/,hair while facing backwards and using sink mirror to mimick the reflection. I would definitely order again and highly recommend.\ud83d\udc4d",
