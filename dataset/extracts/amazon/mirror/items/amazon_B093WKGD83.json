I came across these and really glad they had the size I wanted. They are slightly flexible so that was helpful in inserting them into a frame. The drawback of these mirrors are that they slightly distort the distant background but otherwise are perfectly fine. For the price and quantity, I think they are great quality.",

I\u2019m not sure if it was my wall or what but the adhesive wasn\u2019t as strong as I would have like it, it fell off within an hour of installing it, but my place is also build in the 70s so I don\u2019t know if the wall is perfectly even. I had extra Velcro strips and used that to install and it worked. I love that it looks just like a glass mirror, I was afraid It might have a distorted reflection but so happy to find that it did not. Aside from the adhesive not being strong enough to keep it in place, I\u2019m very happy.",
