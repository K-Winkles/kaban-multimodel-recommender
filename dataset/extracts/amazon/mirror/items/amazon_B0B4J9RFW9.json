I\"m pretty sure I did it, but I don't know how.The mounting system is four screws (you need two) with screw anchors. The back of the mirror has metal toothed \"cleats\" attached, they rest on the heads of the screws.We have a similar one in our upstairs bath, but it's slightly larger. It mounts like a picture frame--a wire from one side to another, goes through a traditional picture hangar. I'd prefer that style. If I knew where it came from, I would have tried to order another, but it's been too long. This one is proportional to the space that it's going into, so it's OK. It looks nice.",

I expect Amazon or the manufacturer to contact me asap.",

When I finally got around to opening the boxes that they were shipped in I found one of them was cracked right across the middle. Not sure how this happened as the mirrors seem to be very well packaged and there was no dents or creases on/in the box externally. Seems that I will need to purchase another one to replace the broken one, as I am at this pint beyond the date of the return window; they sat around for a few months before my project was ready for me to try and make use of them..",
