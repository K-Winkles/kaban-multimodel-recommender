                "reviewText": "This is such a beautiful light fixture. Moreover, it's offered at a reasonable price.I assembled and installed it by myself. For the most part, it was straightforward. I'm a 5'6\", 105lb woman who has a working knowledge of light installation, but mostly I can read and follow directions. That said, it would've been a tad easier to have the use of another set of hands to hold the fixture while attaching it to the ceiling!Insofar as assembling the light, a few of the pieces didn't click into the notches securely. In those cases, I used zip ties to secure the area (my own in addition to the the two supplied). When it was completely assembled, I cut off the zip ties, added a couple drops of gorilla super glue then zip tied it again in those areas for a couple hours. In the meantime, I installed the fixture. It was very easy (but I still would have liked another set of hands).The fixture is gorgeous and just what was needed in the home I was decorating. I was looking for a functional, contemporary statement piece that did not inhibit the line of sight. This piece is the perfect fixture and fulfilled those requirements to a tee.It's finish is oil rubbed bronze which goes with the home's other fixtures. Also, this fixture will compliment a multitude of decorating styles. In my case, I used it for a modern, contemporary home but its style will compliment traditional, country or vintage.At the end of the day, my clients lived the fixture and appreciated that I saved them beaucoup money by installing it myself (ladies, you too can do it if I can).I added three photos of the installed fixture and one of before its installation. I hope they offer you an idea of how the fixture adds to the decor.Take care!",

                "reviewText": "I hung this chandelier in my master bedroom that is 20 x 16 and 10 ft. ceilings. I think the size is perfect. I had been without an overhead light for almost 2 years, as I didn't want to spend a crazy amount of money. But, all of the lights I liked, were very pricey. I saw this one, and for the cost, I think it is perfect. I put it together - which was a bit annoying. But, if you follow directions step by step, it goes together fine. When it was finished and we were installing it, the bottom ring kept \"popping\" out of its spot. I used the zip tie which is included and then added a teeny bit of gorilla glue to hold it together. I also added a crystal ball as the orb that I saw that was much pricier had one and I liked that look. Since this in the bedroom I didn't want it to be super bright. If you used all 60w bulbs it is way too bright. I ended up putting in 5 25w bulbs and I think it's perfect. Note- if you have a lighted switch, you cannot use LED bulbs. This applies to any chandelier. I intended to stick with LED, but I learned there is a very small amount of current that continues to run through the line to keep the switch lit. This causes the LED to continuously glow. We switched the LED out to regular, and it is fine.",

                "reviewText": "Very pleased with this purchase. It arrived quickly and undamaged. Once I decided on buying an orb/spherical chandelier for my living room, I spent a great deal of time researching the various options. I chose this one based upon the size, price, finish, and overall structure.Quality: This one was by far the best value- most comparable items run between $300-500+. The materials are solid, the finish is stunning (I bought the rubbed bronze), and it looks like it cost way more than the $178 I spent on it.Size: It's about 2 feet in diameter. I needed a large fixture as I'm hanging it in a room with tall walls (12 feet). I recommend this size for above-standard height walls or valted ceilings. (Unless your using it to hang over a dining room table- in which case the size/clearance will not impede the walkway.)Assembly: Of course, this style of chandelier is going to require assembly (can you image trying to ship something like this in one piece?!) It took about an hour to assemble. I had my daughter help hold some of the peices in place so I could screw them in at the right angle. The rivets work well as guides and the zip ties that are included are very helpful to stabilize the components during assembly. Tip: You'll need a Philips screwdriver to do so and a wrench to open the chain link segments to hang. Also be sure that you get the angles correct when inserting the screws. Plan on having an assistant to help you.Style: I'm using this as a statement piece for a room I'm designing in an industrial elegant style. The sphere is a great use of shape and it has a timeless and inventive vibe to it.I will post pictures once I have it hung. (Waiting on a professional electrician friend to help with this part as I'm not into electrocuting myself.)UPDATE: I have added 2 pictures to my review. I'm still in process of designing this room but they provide a good view as to how the chandelier works in my house.",
