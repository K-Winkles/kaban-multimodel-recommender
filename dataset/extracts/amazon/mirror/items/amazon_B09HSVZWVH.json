                "reviewText": "I ordered this mirror for my son\u2019s room. The mirror itself is fairly heavy and sturdy. However, the frame it comes encased in is not.I hung the mirror over my son\u2019s bedroom door. A few weeks later something unimaginable happened. I heard a loud crashing sound coming from my son's room.The frame at the top of the mirror had snapped (broken) into two parts. The mirror fell out of the frame and crashed into the nightstand beside my son's bed.Fortunately, my son was not in his room at the time. He could have been seriously injured or killed if the mirror had fallen on him.The 30-day period to request a refund had already closed when this happened. However, given the circumstances, I didn't think it should matter.For some reason Amazon said it was not possible to contact the seller at that time, and Amazon Customer Service initially told me there was nothing they could do. However, after I made Amazon aware of how dangerous this episode had been, they gave me the refund I requested.",
