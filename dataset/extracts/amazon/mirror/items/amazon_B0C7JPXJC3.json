I like that it's a dual sided mirror; One side is 1x and the other is 2x magnification. The first one that I received came broken, but the replacement works great. I love this mirror and would recommend it!",

Anyway the leg swivels well and props the mirror nicely to the desired spot but isn't so loose that it always falls to the lowest setting or anything like that. I got the black border and it looks nice. Not too thick of a frame that it takes up too much space, either. The mirror is shows a good clear reflection and is perfect for any space. I put it on my desk at work and it works great there. It's very portable but keep in mind once you throw away the bubble wrap there's no cover to protect the mirror part if you have it in a bag or something. I'm very happy with this product!",

                "reviewText": "I have been on a bit of a quest to find the perfect (for me) adjustable angle vanity magnifying mirror. This one comes very, very close. I need a mirror that I can get very close to so I can apply eye makeup (without my reading glasses) and also to see those tricky little grooming areas on the face. I don\u2019t have room in front of my vanity to sit down so I have been bending over a small magnifying mirror for a long time.This mirror is great because it doesn\u2019t take up much room on my counter and also has a two way mirror that spins 360\u00b0. One side is normal and the other is 2x magnification. This is my only concern, and the reason for removing a star. Even a 5x would have been much better, 10x perfect, but 2x is a stretch for me. However, the rest of it is practically perfect. I love how the mirror stays in place indefinitely at the angle you leave it. And yet you can move it to any angle you want.It doesn\u2019t have illumination but frankly I think that\u2019s a waste. My bathroom has all the light I need.And at this price, I didn\u2019t expect my problem to be solved this well. I wish I could give it 4 3/4 stars.",
