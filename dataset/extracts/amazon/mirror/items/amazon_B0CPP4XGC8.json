Though the seams around the corners are a minor drawback, I prefer a continuous piece. I will say that once it's hung on the back of my door the seems really weren't that noticeable. The gold-framed mirror, is stunning, offering a natural, undistorted reflection. It's versatile for hanging, leaning, or using its own stand. The aluminum alloy frame is well-constructed, making the space look bigger. It's a fantastic value, heavy-duty with an elegant gold frame, resembling a high-end store purchase.",

This mirror is heavy duty (but I was still able to lug it upstairs myself) and has a nice stand and elegant gold frame. It looks great using the stand or just propped against a wall. It honestly looks like something purchased for several hundred dollars from a big brand home decor store--I'm sure it's a dupe for something trendy that I'm not even aware of!It came very well packaged (pro tip: cut the tape along the thin edges to separate the two pieces of the box) and the only annoying part of it is figuring out how to dispose of the super-sturdy box.",

                "reviewText": "I have been in search of a full length mirror for awhile, this one is great! The mirror was packaged well in the box and arrived in perfect condition. It looks nice and seems well made. I don\u2019t notice any disruption in the glass. I\u2019m using this as a freestanding mirror and didn\u2019t anchor it to the wall, but you can anchor it (hardware included) or use the leg on the back to prop it up. This mirror is longer and wider than my other full length mirrors and I like that. Overall I really like this and would recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "This black framed vertical or horizontal displayed mirror is stunning. The mirror has a natural, undistorted reflection and is approximately 64\" X 21\" complete. You can display it hanging, leaning, or it has its own stand for all by itself standing. The frame is an aluminum alloy and has good quality construction. It definitely will make the space you have look bigger. I would recommend even for just this. \ud83d\udc4d",

It goes with just about any kind of style. The only thing I did not like were these very small seams around the corners. I would\u2019ve preferred it if it was all one continuous piece.",
