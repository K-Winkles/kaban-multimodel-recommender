                "reviewText": "I bought this mirror for my 7 year old granddaughter. She wanted to start playing with makeup like her older sister.First, the packaging was excellent and the mirror arrived with no damage. We got the 10\" x 12\" which is just right for her and her furniture. Lights are bright, but the dimming feature is really important and works well. Color modes are also a nice touch to match various lighting situations. Most importantly, she likes it and it allows her to play at \"fixing up\". Glad we found it.",

She is so little and was terribly upset her present couldn\u2019t even make it a few months. The mirror lights even stopped working before the return window broke, but I wanted to check to see if there may be something with it charging.Do not purchase as the return policy is absolutely horrible and they will not take back a defective product!",
