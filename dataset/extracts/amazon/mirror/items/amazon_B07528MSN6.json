The controls are horrible, loading is to often, no direction of what to do an the puzzles are simple yet so hard because you can\u2019t ever understand the directions to them or worse I can\u2019t even see them half the time the camera angel is so bad lmao. Theres no sort of hint which you mine as well just guess at everything. The studdering and screen tearing kills it. After trying about 10 times to pick it back up and about 4 hours into it I gave up when there\u2019s a cutscene and you die??? Really how bad is this game where you don\u2019t even know what to do or that your even able to control the cutscene ,then it loads your saved game from 10 minutes prior. To painful and slow to play need to have a amazing update or just don\u2019t even purchase this game. I\u2019ve already got mine to be sold to gamestop.",
