I was looking for a replacement and came across this. It looks like a wallet when folded up and is similar in size. Looks nice and the mirror is clear. The mirror seems sturdy and thick, and the edges are beveled. The cover seems well padded and seems it would be good at protecting the mirror from shattering if it took a tumble. Very happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "- Made in China- Case is PU leather- Pretty sure it's glass tho the listing doesn't bother to say- There are no \"adjustable brackets\", at least not on the 4x3 size I got. It does, however, stay in just about any tilted position simply because the pleather is so thick and stiff- There is no \"double layer edging\", I think they might mean the beveled edge- There is no such thing as an \"HD\" mirror but the one I got is quite clear (see my pic)- The edges are decently smooth but the corners are still corners and poky- I have no idea what \"uniform transition\" and \"no strokes\" is supposed to meanJust another foreign AliBaba reseller that just slaps in a bunch of words they think are English.Having said all that, it's a very decent mirror. It's thick and sturdy (see my pic). The cover is also thick and sturdy and water won't ruin it. The large stitching, much moreso than the listing pix, is child-like but straight and decent enough.I assumed this was plastic. I was looking for an unbreakable camping mirror, but it's good enough I'll keep at my desk for unexpected zit checks.5 star mirror, 4 stars for the ridiculous overhype, missing and poor info. I'll update if anything pops up but my initial impression is quite good.Don't forget to use the Smile.Amazon.com address - It's an Amazon program where many everyday things you buy will generate a small donation from Amazon to the charity of your choice at no cost to you.

It\u2019s really not worth it for me to uber to the ups store or spend $8 to have ups come pick it up. Otherwise I would return it.This didn\u2019t happen in delivery. The item has this great protective cover and if also came in a box and bubble wrapped packaging. The defect had to be there before delivery. If not for that. Its great. Its just sad that I have to see that blemish every time I use the mirror. Its a great size for my requirements.This case thing is pretty amazing the stitches are very tight. It\u2019s definitely not cheap looking. The mirror itself has beveled edges. So its not a cheap looking mirror either. I would probably take a chance on buying another one if I were not needing it right now.",
