It has a great suction mount but it sticks out a couple of inches. Because of that, I mounted the mirror on the front wall instead of on the side where I usually put them -- turns out this is a much better location.Note: I have used this mirror for almost 2 months now and still believe it is the best one out there.

                "reviewText": "Seems like a good product, but only got to use once. When trying to move it to a new location in the shower, the suction was so strong it ended up breaking the mount before the suction cup let loose. I don't see having to worry about this thing falling off in the middle of the night and scaring anyone half to death, but you may need to leave it attached to the shower wall if you decide to sell or leave the house...this is by far the most powerful suction cup of it's size/function I have ever encountered. That said, it didn't fog up at all and I was able to get good visual clarity when shaving. The razor holder could stand to fit a bit more snug, but not a deal breaker.",
