I don\u2019t think the mirrors are glass, which I prefer since my daughter is younger. It\u2019s nice and lightweight. The little dish in the stand if perfect for stashing a favorite piece of jewelry or lip balm for easy access.Overall, a purchase I am happy with. I\u2019d gladly buy it again!",

Getting rid of my mirror back then was extremely difficult because I loved it so much!This one is so much better than my og model. Although mine had different lighting selections as far as color goes and brightness, this one is sturdy, brightness selector is easy and the mirror isn\u2019t so large I can\u2019t fit it on my vanity. I love that it folds to keep the mirror clean and looking new.I highly recommend these mirrors for all girls!!",
