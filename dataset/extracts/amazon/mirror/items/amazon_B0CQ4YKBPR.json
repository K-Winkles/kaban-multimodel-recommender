        "description": "This product requires the use of a display screen and a camera for interactive purposes. We can provide design blueprints and hardware specifications for the display screen. Designed specifically for children, the software encompasses six common issues children may face: overeating, picky eating, neglecting tooth brushing, poor hygiene, staying up late, and unhealthy eye habits. Each bad habit can have negative effects on the body. When a child stands in front of the screen, they see themselves on the display. Based on the system settings, their on-screen reflection undergoes magical transformations corresponding to the set habits. For example, if set to overeating, the player will see their on-screen self transformed into a chubby figure. If set to neglecting tooth brushing, the player will witness their on-screen teeth turning yellow and dirty, with significant cavities. This exaggerated interactive approach aims to encourage children to develop healthy lifestyle habits.",
