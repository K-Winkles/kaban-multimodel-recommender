                "reviewText": "Really like that it folds with the mirror inside and well protected. Used on a table with regular height, the adjustable height basically brings it to face level comfortably. Extended almost to maximum, without something to weigh the base down, it does topple over. I just placed my hair brush on the base, no problem.My only wish is that it also comes in 5x or 7x, the whole mirror that is. I would love to have that. This way I can travel with two mirror, one regular and the other 5x or 7x magnification.The small 5x mirror is not really helpful. Another brand has the magnetic feature so the small magnifying mirror attached itself to th main mirror. But it doesn't have the great adjustable, as much as this one, feature, plus the magnetic feature just adds weight.",

She did not need a fancy mirror as she was 12 and perfect but this thing is good for the older ladies too. The light is perfect, the ability to bend it to my will. Omg! Just do it!",

                "reviewText": "I was so excited for this mirror. Paid extra for it because it has adjustable height. However, I was only able to use it ONCE then it stopped working! I bought this extra early for my trip and didn't use it till my trip besides the occasional charging and testing to make sure it works. I took it on my 2 week European trip only to have it die on me on the first morning there! I turned on then sputtered and shut off and refused to turn on again even after charging! What a waste of my money! I didn't get the other less expensive mirrors because I so liked the adjustable height feature but had I known it would only work, essentially, for one use only I wouldn't have bothered. And since I didn't use it till after the return period, I wasn't able to return it! Beware guys!",
