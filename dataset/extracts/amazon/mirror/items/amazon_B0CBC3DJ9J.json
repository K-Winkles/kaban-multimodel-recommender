                "reviewText": "I\u2019m working on a bathroom painting and redecorating project and saw this mirror, so decided to give it a look. ;-) It turns out this mirror has good optical quality and the brushed finish on the frame goes well with other fixtures in the bathroom.Each mirror came with mounting screws that I used, and inserts that I don\u2019t like, so I used my favorite fasteners which are the auger type. There\u2019s also a full-size paper pattern inside the box that locates screw location and spacing for hanging the mirror. Careful layout of the pattern using painter\u2019s tape can result in perfect centering, height, and plumb. Two cautions for layout using the pattern: I needed to compensate for the mirror holes being \u215b \u201c closer together than in the pattern, so comparing the actual hole separation with the pattern may save a little grief. Second, there are X marks on the pattern for marking where the screws are to be placed and if you use these spots for locating screws, it will result in the mirror height being \u00bd \u201c lower than the pattern shows. This is due to the slot the mirror frame slides down to trap the screw heads.Mirror good, hardware and pattern second rate.Answering a question about whether the mirror corners are round or square: if your mirror corners are not like in this picture, you have the wrong mirror.",

I was certain I would replace the bathroom mirror with another sheet mirror until I happened to see this mirror. It is sturdy, I like the heavy-duty black frame that the mirror is set into. The mirror glass is of good quality as there are no distortions. I used a glass cleaner to clean it and it left the mirror reflecting nicely with no streaks. I decided to have the bathroom remodeled to match the black frame of the mirror. My contractor has not yet installed the mirror but was not impressed with the screws provided in the package for hanging, he will be using what he uses to hang bathroom mirrors. I will update my review once the mirror is installed and in use.",
