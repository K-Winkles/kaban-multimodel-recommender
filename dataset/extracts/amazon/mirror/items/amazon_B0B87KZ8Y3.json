I made an exchange right away through Amazon and before I even returned the broken one, I received a new perfect mirror as it's replacement! The customer service was excellent! (And then I returned the broken one, of course.)Just fyi- I didn't notice the hangers are located on the outside of the styrofoam within the packaging. I ordered white, so they blended in with the styrofoam. So be on the lookout for them if you plan to hang over a door.But as for the quality- They're excellent! I can see my full body when I use them on my door. They're sturdy, and have clean lines so they blend in with a variety of decor.Thank you NeuType!",

You genius, you...Im sure the person who came up with the hook placement is a very creative individual...but it does not make sense to place 1 hanging hook on the corner of the mirror sides, because once it's \"hung\" it will be crooked.If it ain't broke, don't fix it or add your *sparkle* to it.Just keep the hanging hooks in the middle.I'll figure out a way to properly hang these hopefully, or order a new mirror with proper hanging hooks and instructions.Save your money.",

Update: so besides the hanging debacle, the actual mirror itself looks very nice hanging on my closet door. So not a complete disappointment in the end :)",
