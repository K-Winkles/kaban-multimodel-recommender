I use this product to do my hair because I used to struggle so much with trying to see every angle of my head when doing my hair, I am at home hairstylist, and I travel for certain clientele. This product has been a lifesaver for both me and my clientele. Not only am I able to see every angle when I\u2019m doing my hair I\u2019m also able to see every angle when doing someone else\u2019s hair. If you guys are looking for a product such as this one, I recommend you guys give this a try, the LED is bright It comes with its own charger works perfectly, and can also be used for cutting your hair, for parting your hair, for wanting to see the finishing touches of your hair and so much more. i\u2019ve had this product for maybe three months or more and have not had any issues.",
