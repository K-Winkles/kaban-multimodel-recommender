                "reviewText": "I had been looking for a working fogless mirror for some time. I purchased several others; most claim to be fogless but are not. Others are fogless for the first few uses, then they're not. However, this fogless mirror carries promise why because it does not use an \"ant-fog coating.\" Instead it uses simple science and heats the mirror. I couldn't for the life of me understand why other mirrors did not do the same, especially when they're battery-powered anyway. I have only had the mirror for a day and used it once, but it has so far impressed me. The defogging feature works like a charm as long as you remember that it's a long two-second press to activate it rather than a simple tap. The light is very bright and allows for a clear unobstructed view. Despite the great experience so far, I have two critiques of this item. 1. it uses an adhesive to stick to the bathroom wall. It's 2024, and we should have suction options so the mirror can be moved when needed. Its a bit odd that an adhesive is still being used. The second critique is the use of the functions. Sometimes, I have to tap a couple of times before the device can recognize that I'm trying to change the brightness.As I mentioned before, I truly do enjoy this item, I wish I had purchased the 3x zoom or 2x zoom for a closer shave, but overall, I am satisfied. Def worth the cost, especially since I couldn't find any other mirror that comes close to being fogless.",

                "reviewText": "I've been a shower-shaver for years and my last anti-fog mirror in the shower finally had so much hard water scaling that it was worse than fog on a mirror! I tried a couple others that did absolutely nothing to prevent fog, so I decided to go for the bigtime with this lighted, heated mirror. It's changed my shower shaving life!Firstly, I have a small stand-in shower stall, so space is of a premium. This does extend a bit from the wall, which is necessary for being able to pivot and angle. But let's face it, in the shower on the wall, it's not needed to have 20 degrees of motion let alone the claimed 360 degrees. (That's also a misnomer, as it'll rotate 360 degrees, but that's pointless. You're still limited by the angle to the wall, but again... who cares?)As I increase in years, I actually found that the light is a great enhancement to a shower mirror that I hadn't originally looked for. Now I don't think I'll be without a lighted mirror for shaving again! Having different color temperatures and brightness levels is a perk, but again not one I would have sought out.The real game changer here is the heated function. It does take a minute or two to heat up but it's truly... THE. BEST. WAY. TO. PREVENT. FOGGING. Different coatings, materials, sprays, etc... they can help a bit but we really need to prevent the condensation in the first place, and this does the job. Even after the mirror starts to fog up, hitting the heat will clear it in a minute or two. Good stuff.So yeah... this is a GREAT mirror. Why deduct a star? Well, besides being a very critical reviewer sometimes, there are some areas to improve. The heat, for one, is only in the center of the mirror. There's a good half-inch border and the entire bottom of the mirror where the buttons are that don't heat up and therefore still get foggy. Also, the distance it extends out from the wall is a bit much. Finally, the magnification is a mixed bag. I definitely don't need magnification to get a close shave. That said, I did find it somewhat handy to get a good view on the detail areas. It's also made me realize that the nose hairs are not nearly as groomed as I'd previously thought! So there is that... but it's a bit overkill still. Something like 2x would have been ideal, perhaps.So yeah... I do really like this mirror. Enough to stop my hunt for a good replacement mirror. But the perfectionist in me does think this could be even better!",

                "reviewText": "I was initially impressed with this mirror. I put it up in the shower- NOT in direct water flow. It was under my showerhead and attached with the adhesion/glue with no problem. The mirror itself was awesome, light is very bright, and the anti-fog part worked really well. After only 1 shower, probably 5-6 hours after attaching it to a cleaned surface, with regular shower steaminess, I heard this CLUNK followed by what sounds like a quarter dropping and spinning till its flat, only WAY LOUDER. (If you have kids, you end up being an expert at what causes which noises)) I knew what it was before I went in to check. The mirror was on the floor of the shower, thankfully UNbroken. The attachment in the pictures was also on the floor. It seems that the rounded (weak point) that holds of the back of the screw broke, which put too much tension on the square adhesion and pulled off dropping the mirror. This sucks. I loved how it fit in with my bathroom and actually WORKED. I am going to figure out my own way to attach the stem, because I really like this. But you guys need to figure out a better way to attach something this heavy besides a small PLASTIC round doodad held on by a thin glue pad. If it was a strong stable attachment, it would get 5 stars. I don't have an option to \"contact seller\" for some reason on this product. It only let me chat with an amazon online \"person\" and they only offer returns or replacement. No thanks- Ill figure it out myself. If the company reads this, PLEASE rework the attachment base of this mirror. I'm sure this will happen to someone else- Bummer.",

I have not charged it since the original charge (I use the light and heater maybe once a week). It has always stayed fog free even when everything else around me is fogged up. When there are dried water spots on it a wet and dry paper towel brings it back to like new. I can't say enough good things. Try it you won't be disappointed.",
