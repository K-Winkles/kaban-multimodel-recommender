                "reviewText": "Made and set in the late fifties, this gripping melodrama is a realistic portrayal of a middle class commercial artist, Jim, fallen prey to chronic alcoholism, his long suffering wife, and a mysterious stranger he meets in a drunk tank who tells him there is a way to stay sober. The hero, portrayed by Richard Egan rebels against everyone trying to help him, including his wife (Julie London) and doctor (Walter Matthau). In a moment of desperation he starts taking the stranger's advice and tries to help fellow drunks. Of course, nothing is less reliable than a drunk and Jim fears everything will fall apart. Also starring Arthur O'Connell and Troy Donahue. Score by Henry Mancini.",
