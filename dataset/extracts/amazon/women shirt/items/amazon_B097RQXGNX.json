The quality feels great, they are true to size, and not sheer. They are great to wear casual or to dress it up a bit. I am a mother to a toddler and these are great to wear, especially when you go out and are running around with kids. I will definitely be purchasing more. Great buy!",

I returned the \"red\" - the was more like a deep orange. Kept the rest!VERY comfortable, light knit, washes and dries well on cold-delicate/low. Nice subtle A-line flare design hides one's imperfections. ;)Length is just right for me, comes to high thigh. Covers my bum with a few inches to spare - so works for leggings. But not so long that I can't wear with pants or even the right skirt.If they had a true red and/or a light yellow I'd get those too.Highly recommend.Great price. I believe I will get a lot of use out of these.",

It really hangs nicely on the body and I will be getting another one. I haven't washed it yet, so not sure how it washes up. Definitely a nice shirt you can dress up or down.",
