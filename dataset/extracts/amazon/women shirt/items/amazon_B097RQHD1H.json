The fabric feels soft and the colors don't seem to leak in the wash like some other cloths of this price category. You definitely aren't winning any fashion prizes with these, but for around the house wear and light errands they're more than enough IMO. They also can disguise some of the less flattering parts of one's figure (at least in my case) with their looseness.",

They are thin but not in a bad way, it makes them drape perfectly. The back comes down just long enough on me to cover my whole backside and hang about an inch further for modesty. It\u2019s so stretchy, the material is very soft, it\u2019s a tad loose but that\u2019s EXACTLY what I wanted! For reference: I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d 206 lbs 42DDD, 39\u201d waist, 46\u201d hips, I ordered XXL.I love these shirts, and even while I\u2019m losing weight, they will still look nice and fit great!
