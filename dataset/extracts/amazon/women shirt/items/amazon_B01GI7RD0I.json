Sometimes they are too long and just look funny.The color was spot on to the advertisement. Very vibrant, even after 4-5 washings.Decent length over all.Doesn't wrinkle anywhere close to as bad as I thought it would. (not saying it doesn't wrinkle, just not AS bad as I expected.)Thinks I wasn't impressed by:I don't like the material, it just feels funny to me. But likely just me, as I am picky when it comes to this. This feels kinda like a stiff t-shirt.The length is decent, would be perfect with one or two more inches. This would keep it from going above the waist when reaching or bending.I probably wouldn't buy this again, but I'm not sad I did. I enjoy wearing this shirt, will just keep searching for the perfect shirt for my preferences.",
