                "reviewText": "I have the real Free People Duo Corset Cami (size Medium) and I bought this dupe (size Small). Let me tell you, the fabrics are nearly identical in thickness, quality, and comfort, but I like the way this dupe fits better! I am a 30DD with a very saggy chest and honestly this dupe not only was more supportive without a bra, but the \u201ccups\u201d of the neckline were SLIGHTLY bigger (covered a tad more) on the dupe, which was not enough to change the overall appearance of the top, but it definitely made me feel like I was way less likely to accidentally flash someone. The Free People top I would say probably fits better for the smaller chested queens :)This dupe is also a hair shorter/more cropped than the Free People one (which, again, I actually like that better!)In the pictures the pink top is this dupe, and the purple top is the real Free People top. I tried both on with and without a bra for a compare/contrast.Honestly my only gripe with this dupe is that they don\u2019t have more sizes and colors because I would love to have this dupe in a lavender or light blue color!Overall this is a super high quality dupe, I\u2019m going to be needing every color. If you are on the fence about it, honestly just buy it it\u2019s so cute!!",
