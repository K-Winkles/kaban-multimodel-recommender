                "reviewText": "I own several of the short-sleeved version of these tee shirts, so I knew that the fabric, style, quality and fit of these tees would be great. But I wanted some with longer sleeves for fall and winter.As a petite person with short arms, long sleeves are usually several inches too long on me, so I decided to go with these 3/4-sleeve tees. The shirts are wonderful in all other aspects, but the sleeve length is just weird, ending in a gangly midpoint half way between my elbow and my wrist. If I were to reorder more of these tees, guess I will have to opt for the full length sleeves and resign myself to folding them back several inches.Otherwise, I totally recommend Amazon Essentials' cotton-modal-spandex tees. They look, feel, fit, and wash/dry/wear like a dream. The most flattering and comfortable tees I have ever worn!",

And I think the price is really reasonable too!I haven't washed it yet so we'll see how that goes but so far I would recommend for those that don't like heavy sweaters.",

                "reviewText": "I am a 34A. I am 5'7\" and weigh about 110 pounds. I bought the Heather shirt in size small.It is fitted but not tight. Actually, I wish it were a bit more fitted on each side at the waist area, a bit more tapered in for women. It is longer than shown. On me, I could pull it down straight and it would be long enough to use as a tunic for leggings. Not long enough to be officially tunic length, but one could use it for that. The sleeves, also, are fitted but not tight, but my arms are thin. They truly are 3/4 length sleeves, which is nice. The shirt is comfortable and cozy. I actually bought another, same size and colour, as I liked it so much. It is somewhat thin but thick enough to be fine to wear out of the house. A lighter colour may be too thin, but so far I only have the Heather, so I cannot say what another colour may be like. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and will probably get more in different colours.UPDATE: I tried on the second one I bought. This one is a bit more tapered through the sides, which I like. It is not tight, though, so it is comfortable, like the first one. It fits just right. As with most clothes, each one will fit differently, but I did want to give the update that this one fit more like I like but that the other fits well, too. I recommend these shirts.",
