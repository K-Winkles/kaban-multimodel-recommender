This is just right for me. It is not for a petite person, but an average sized person. And it is made of cotton which for me is a plus. I bought black, white, and the hot pink. They wash well...no shrinkage.",

                "reviewText": "The fabric is a nice weight. Tight woven medium weight. The seams, cut and overall design is well done for a cheaper cost shirt. It's soft but keeps it's shape nicely. It does run small so if you have a bigger chest or carry fat around your back or middle or have wider shoulders, get a size bigger than you normally wear. I have long arms and the sleeves hit my wrists just below the crease of my hand, which I like but if you're petite, the sleeves will be very long (easy to alter if you sew. And if you don't, just roll them up or use fabric tape and turn them under. Or sew them under and add a thumb hole if you like that). I washed this in warm water before wearing it and it didn't shrink or wrinkle up or get \"fuzz balls\". This is a great shirt for jammies or with jeans. It works for both.",

I can't even wear it around the house because someone might come to the door, and I don't want anyone to take one look at me and know which bra I decided to wear today. This shirt is so thin it's useless. So that was money just thrown away.",
