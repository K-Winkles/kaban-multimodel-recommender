While our workwear is now available in more than 100 countries across the world, we\u2019re not all that different from when we first opened our doors. We still make bib overalls.

                "reviewText": "I first purchased this heavyweight t-shirt for a senior age male. It quickly became his favorite and multiples were purchased. I then purchased it for my high school grandson. Very comfortable/flattering, purchased multiples. Earlier this year, I purchased 5 if them for my adult son, to reolace his thin, ragged t-shirts. All the shirts are just as sturdy and comfortable as day one. I was a little jealous. To my surprise, found that they have the same heavyweight t-shirts for women. I ordered 4 and now ordered a total of 8 for myself. If you like a casual, loose fitting T with a good drape, this shirt is a dream come true. If you want traditional, fitted, shorter sleeve type shirt, try ine of these for sleeping. I predict you will become just as hooked as we are. Comfort is KING (or in my case (QUEEN). Enjoy. (You will thank me later-hee hee).",

In my eyes, a branded pocket on a shirt with a pen clipped in it says \u201cI mean business\u201d just as much as a collar. Nice thick and durable cotton. A little boxy looking but it\u2019s not un-wearable. I like the fit of Carhartt better.. but really these are just as good.",
