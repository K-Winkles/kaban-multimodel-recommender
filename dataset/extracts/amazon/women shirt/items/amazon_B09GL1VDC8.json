                "reviewText": "We bought 4 of these, sized: 3T, Youth Medium, Male Adult Medium, and Male Adult XL . All of us were swallowed by these, even after washing. Good news: you can order a size down, they don't seem to shrink and they're super cute. We wore them for a family outing. Not great news: My almost 8 year old could get the 3T on, and I accidentally wore my husbands Medium even though my regular size would be a woman's XL or 2XL (depending on brand). I had to laugh at my husband as the Medium is SO big on him (he usually wears a Med). We compared the Men's M to the Men's XL, and the size difference is maybe a cm or 2max... Anyways, point is, they run really big. But - upside, they'll fit / last us longer. Oh, and the arm length is a little longer than a normal T-shirt. Not very flattering or terribly comfortable shirt, but worth it to us as it's a super cute family shirt. I ordered these at the beginning of the month, needing them by the 28th, and only 2 arrived on time. That was frustrating, but we still wear them and will have future family outings where we can wear these again. I recommend these if you order them plenty in advance and if you order a size smaller if you want a more accurate size. Best of luck!",
