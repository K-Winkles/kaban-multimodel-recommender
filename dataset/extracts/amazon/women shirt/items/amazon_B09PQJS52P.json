                "reviewText": "THE FIT: I am 5'6\" and weigh 180, with a 40D bust and broad shoulders. The fit is perfect for a long-ish top, but it is definitely NOT tunic-length as shown on the model (she must be 5'2\"). It only falls halfway over my bum in back and barely comes to crotch in front. I could never wear over just leggings, but will wear as a shirt over jeans or a skirt. It's comfortably fitted around the bust and shoulders, a little clingy but does not show every flaw. This size would also look good on someone a little thinner, or a little taller, as a top. If I purchase again, might get the 2x.THE FABRIC: The fabric is very comfortable, soft and smooth. It's thin, and breathes, but is not see-through in the dark color I chose.THE COLOR: my monitor is pretty accurate, so I have to say that the vendor photo is not. This green is so dark that at first I thought it was charcoal, then took it into daylight and can see that it's a dark olive, but darker than the photo. It looks and feels great over palazzo pants. Search for Beauty Batik and see plus sizes.UPDATE: I washed it on delicate cycle, warm wash/cold rinse, and hung it over a sweater rack to dry. It did not bleed, did not shrink.",

                "reviewText": "This top is fabulous. I bought one, and immediately went back and bought three more in different colors. Having read the reviews, I went one size up (from 2X to 3X) and I'm happy with that fit. It's nice and tailored around the neck, fits well in the shoulders, then flows out nicely skimming the tummy. Doesn't cling too much, so no huge worry on showing bra straps digging in. Sleeves have sufficient room, not too big or small. I think the fact that this product has so many people posting photos is testament to how much people feel good in these tops. I love the Mocha color, it's classy and looks really nice under black and cream work jackets. The purple and navy are deeper and richer colors than the photo would indicate, just lovely, they look expensive. And I have totally fallen in love with rayon as a fabric, the flow and breathability of it works really well. I wouldn't try to wear this with leggings, it's not quite long enough. But it's lovely out over jeans, and really nice tucked in for work.",
