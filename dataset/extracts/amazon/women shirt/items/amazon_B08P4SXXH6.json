                "reviewText": "\"ALL LOVE\" ORANGE HEART SHIRT SPECIFICALLY -For anyone interested in the \"All Love\" orange heart t-shirt, the shirt itself is an off-white/cream color instead of the white as stated & shown in the listing photos. Also, the heart itself is a much darker orange than in listing photos. In fact, in person it is even a little darker than my attached photos.THE T-SHIRTS IN GENERAL - I'M A FAN.I already have about 8 of these crew & v-neck t-shirts from the last 2 or 3 years in plain white to wear alone or under clothing. I actually like these better than the Gap brand t-shirts I own. They have held up very well despite many, many wearings & washings. I wash & dry them w/ like colors in cold or eco warm water on either the perm press or gentle cycle depending on other items in load. I never noticed any shrinking so if they did shrink some it was minimal. They never wrinkle if hung or folded within a reasonable time after drying. They are very soft on the skin & not too thin or see-through. The fit of this shirt is flattering. They are a little clingy & form fitting on me but it may just b/c I am literally so curvy. I get the XXL which is my normal size but wish they sold a 3XL b/c sometimes I want a looser fit especially in the lighter colors. (Fyi - I am wearing a lounge bra in the photos so it would be more flattering with a proper bra holding my ladies up. It would also help if I stood up straight! Lol.) For reference my measurements are 46-38-56 & b/c of my high waist to hip ratio I am a hard fit. I am right there on the border between regular women's tops & plus size tops.LONG-SLEEVE VERSIONS -Everything I said above is referring to the short sleeve versions of these t-shirts. I do have a few of Amazon Essentials' long-sleeve versions as well. One thing I find weird is that the ones I have bought w/ long-sleeves (white, grey & navy) seem slightly thinner & I find them to be a tighter fit. I don't wear any of my long-sleeve ones by themselves b/c I feel self-conscious. While they still feel comfortable on, they cling too tight in my gut & hip area making them unflattering. They make great undershirts, though, under sweaters & stuff. That being said, I recommend going up one size in the long-sleeve version. I wish I could...AMAZON ESSENTIALS' PLUS SIZES -Yes, Amazon Essentials appears to offer plus sizes in a few of the t-shirt styles but in all the years I have been buying these I have NEVER seen any of the plus size shirts actually be available for purchase. They are always listed as either \"out of stock\" or just plain \"unavailable\". Bad luck on my part? Maybe. (Hey Amazon - Is it really that hard to keep these mass produced t-shirts in stock? And why don't you offer plus sizes in all or most of your t-shirt styles? The demand is there. Just sayin'.)",

I received them today, and Iam pleasantly pleased with the quality. They are a heavier than I expected and run true to size. Also, they are slightly fitted but not skintight.theyare cotton, so I expect to have to wash them in cold and dry onextralow.",
