                "reviewText": "The quality of this shirt is very good. The fabric is yarn dyed versus printed on the fabric which should keep the colors vibrant longer. A lot of attention to details such as a flattering fit versus the usual boxy fit found in most flannel shirts. The shirt is long enough to cover your back side and for those that have more ample hips the shirts flared sides provides for a roomier fit. Having sewed many of my clothes over the years the only thing I didn't like was that the pattern did not match up on the sides, however it matched perfectly in the front. I haven't washed it yet but with it being 100% cotton I plan to wash on cold and hang dry. For reference I am 5'3\", 120 lbs, the shirt in the picture is size small. I purchased a medium before this one and it was too big, I'm returning it but only to exchange sizes because I like the shirt so much.",

The only drawback is how much they shrink. A lot. Like, at least a full size.I am a firm Medium, at 5'6\" and 149 lbs. I wanted this to be a second layer, so I ordered Large in a couple of colors. They fit perfectly over a base layer. Then I washed them. They still fit, but definitely not over anything more than a thin tank, and the sleeves are now too short. Admittedly, my arms are a little long. So I ordered this one in XL, washed it, and now it's a nice Large to go over a light or medium-weight base layer. I do highly recommend these! Just order up a size if you plan to wash it.",

                "reviewText": "This shirt is better quality than any clothing I\u2019ve probably ever purchased off this site. The flannel is nice and heavy, the colors pretty, and the shirt seems to be very well made. It washes well, and I really like that it has a bit of shape to it and isn\u2019t wide and boxy like so many these days. I ordered my usual size and it fits well overall, although it is slightly snug around my hips, but that\u2019s my build, not the shirt\u2019s fault. My only concern and the only thing that would make me think twice before ordering in another color is that the shirt gaps open a bit between the middle/upper buttons sometimes even though it doesn\u2019t feel tight at all. Since I always layer with at least a tank top underneath, it\u2019s not a deal breaker. I am pleased enough with the fabric and quality that I will likely purchase again, even if I decide to try sizing up.",

                "reviewText": "Size XL: Gorgeous shirt, warm, 100% medium weight cotton flannel, and extremely well made (opinion of dressmaker). I'm a size 14 with a thick waist (no flat tummy here) and it was way too tight on my bust and tummy. 100% cotton will undoubtedly shrink even in cold water wash and line dried, and I like to dry my cotton shirts on low in dryer to prevent wrinkling, so that's another shrinkage issue.The shirt is darted down both sides of front and both sides of back, thus the slim-fit. If the darts hadn't been there, it would have been a perfect fit with room for shrinkage. I just ordered the XXL and hope the shoulders don't hang halfway down to my elbows, and hope it won't be too baggy. I never buy XXL, but I really loved this shirt and hope it works. I can always shorten it and roll up the sleeves if it drives me nuts. I'm 5'5\" and wear size 14 bottoms and XL tops, and this shirt is very long. Back of shirt came down to mid-thigh and front just a tad shorter than the back.Update on XXL: The shoulders hang 2\" off my shoulders and it looks really sloppy, and the sleeves are beyond my finger tips. The shirt is the length of a long night shirt, and there's no way I am willing to alter all of these things. I wanted this shirt to fit so much, but this one will have to go back also. The bust and tummy area do fit much better, but the overall shirt is just way too big.",

Cold wash did not affect the fabric at all, neither did a short trip in the dryer on low.
