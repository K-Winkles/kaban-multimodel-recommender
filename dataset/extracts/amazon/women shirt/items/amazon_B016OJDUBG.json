                "reviewText": "These tees are surprisingly nice for the price. They aren't the most high end, nor are they low end either. The material is soft, adequate thickness (light enough for summer but not see through) and stitched properly. The only thing to be aware of is the sizing. Based on the reviews, I ordered these tees TWO sizes larger than I normally would order. They are 100% cotton and will shrink one size after you wash and dry them. Add to that, they run an extra size smaller to begin with. Hence the two sizes larger. Since I hate tight fitting tee shirts, the larger size fit me just right after washing. They are a bit long for me since I am short, but I'm accustomed to that. I originally bought one to try it out. I was quite satisfied with my first purchase, so I ordered 3 more in different colors. Again, great basic tee shirts for the price. I ordered purple, aqua, black & grey (not in stock right now.)",

                "reviewText": "Reviews were all over about these tops. I still have a couple jms tees that must be 15 years old but are soon to be turned into rags. I wanted a casual tee that is all cotton with sleeves that are not too tight or too short. I have blended tees that fit through the body but the sleeves make my arms look like sausage stuffed into a small casing and they tend to sink into creases. I am 5'3\", 230 lbs, bust measures 47\", waist 46 1/2\", hips 51\". I have broad shoulders and chubby arms. The circumference of the top of my arm measures 16 1/2\" and length from top of shoulder to elbow bend is7 1/2\". I normally wear a 3x or 2x sometimes. The 2 pictures on the left are the 4x I ordered after reading they run small. It was bigger than I would like and seemed like a true 4x. I washed it in cold water and dried on normal, hoping it would shrink a littles as some had complained they did. It did not shrink at all. I took a chance and ordered 3 in a 3x. hoping the sizing would be accurate. These fit the way I like and those are the 2 pics on the right. The sleeves are not too short or tight., the armholes fit normally and comfortably and the v neck is not too low for me. The cotton is soft. Some complained it is scratchy but mine are not at all. The length goes to the top of my thighs in front and bottom of my butt in back and the scoop hem is very slight as is the cut through the sides. The material does not stick in creases yet is not real thick. They should be comfortable in hot weather. I washed the 3 x's in cold water and dried on delicate just to be sure they didn't shrink. There was no shrinkage on these either. They all fit the same. I had gotten 2 more in the blue and 1 grey. The stitching and seams are good and the v neckline still laid flat after washing. The pictures posted are after the shirts were washed. You do need to get them out of the dryer right away or I am sure they will wrinkle a lot. Considering some of the reviews, I don't know if I just got lucky or if the mfg. has made quality changes but I am very happy with the shirts I got and they are true to my normal size. I wanted a casual shirt for around the house in 100% cotton, running errands or a casual restaurant and these fit the bill for my needs. Some say these fit boxy and I suppose you could say they do since the side dip is not as much as many womens shirts are made but I don't want shirts that pull tight across my belly.",

                "reviewText": "It seems like it is very difficult to find shirts that cover my butt these days. Many of the shirts in stores are on the short side for my tastes. This shirt fits well and is flattering but it is still a little short. After a few washes (even with hang drying them) the shirts have shrunk and now when I raise my arms my stomach will show. It is a great shirt but I wish they were made longer so that it covers my stomach fully.",
