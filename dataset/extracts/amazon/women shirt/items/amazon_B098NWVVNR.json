It's snug (which I like), but not tight.I bought 4 of these: charcoal, camel, coral orange and rust orange and I like them best to worst in that order. The only reason I don't like then all the same is that there's some variance in the manufacturing and some of the tops have a wider neck opening than others. With the charcoal and camel colored ones, my bra strap doesn't show, but with the coral and rust orange ones, the bra strap tends to peek out because the neckline is wider.",

                "reviewText": "So... I always like a square neckline, but they are hard to get right. Often they gape, but this one does not. The trade-off is that it pulls across the boobs. I first tried size large L (Amazon suggests), but as this is slim-fit and I'm not really, I sized up to extra-large XL (if you don't mind clingy shirts, L can work, but XL wasn't so much bigger I looked awkward and looked nicer down the back and on the sides). I had hoped it would eliminate the horizontal lines that appear because I have breasts (currently wearing 38D in most brands/cuts), but they remained. However, as the quality of the fabric (heavier than the competition, nice sheen) and the price all suit, and the shirt behaves all day long, I've decided I can live with this. If I catch more nice colors on sale, I will likely repurchase this shirt.",

                "reviewText": "I love the fabric. I\u2019ve always loved modal fabric because it\u2019s so soft. I got the blue and white colors. They are true to the colors in the photos (can\u2019t speak for the other colors) and true to the size chart. 37\u201d bust, 32\u201d waist, 32D bra; size M fits perfectly and isn\u2019t skin-tight. I can see a bit of my bra lines at the back but that\u2019s just normal for fitted knit tops like these. It\u2019s not obvious enough to be a problem. However, if you\u2019re bigger than me in the bust, you may want to size up to avoid the dreaded horizontal stretch/crease lines across the chest, because this is a slim-fit design that skims the body more closely than relaxed t-shirts. It is very flattering. I have average size arms and the arms of this thing are comfortable, not too tight at all. It fits like the product photos look. The fabric is light but not transparent. You do need nude colored underwear for the white color, as usual.I am thinking about getting more colors because the design is so versatile. The square neck and half sleeves give it that extra something that looks more polished than a regular t-shirt and makes it easy to dress up or down as needed.",

Simply said, when a color is mixed with other colors you do not see those colors, you can not name the colors but a hauntingly beautiful color is created , like this pink. It is so beautiful, It has a subtle brightness that warms my sallow skin tone. The perfectly-cut, feminine neckline sets this shirt apart from hundreds out there. The sleeves are just long enough to hide wrinkles some of us would prefer not to show, but still cool enough to wear in Florida on hot days. This color pink goes with grey, dark and light blue, greens, tans. etc ...It fits my size S perfectly, made from quality fabric . The first time I washed it by hand because I love it so much. I hope to wear it for years. I have no hesitation to highly recommend Amazon Essentials Slim fit Tshirt.",
