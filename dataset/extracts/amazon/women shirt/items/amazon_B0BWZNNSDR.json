I'm wearing a white crewneck for a classic look under sweaters and sweatshirts, for this look they don't really work. I'd be better off with a mens plain tee. Don't get the hype on these, not all that, basically a cheap white tee that is too boxy, sheer and short.",

I never saw this before and it was not disclosed in the description. Now that i need to use the shirts, big seam presented itself. The Amazon return window is closed so there goes that idea. Lesson learned.",
