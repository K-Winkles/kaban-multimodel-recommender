It's both stretchy and supportive. No sheerness since it is double-lined. It's a good length too! It can be worn right at the waist (depending on torso length, mine is slightly longer than average) or it still looks cute if scrunched up for a more cropped look. I bought this in 3 colors and definitely going to order more!",

                "reviewText": "For reference, I am 5\u20197, 120kbs and ordered 4 shirts, 2 XS and 2 S. A lot of times when I order shirts on amazon, even the XS\u2019s will be too big or shaped for spongebob squarepants. These shirts fit me really nice and are very comfortable. The XS is just a tad too short for my long torso as I like to tuck my shirts into my pants and the XS I have to tuck in every so often as its not long enough to in. My skims do this too though and its not a deal breaker. The S\u2019s definitely have a bit more room and Im able to stretch it enough to where I like. Like many have said, the sleeves are on the shorter side BUT I do not mind this as I hate when sleeves are so long they cover my hand or feel restricted. I do recommend this shirt and hope this review helps those similar in height/weight as I took a chance on these not knowing what to expect. Worth the cost for half the price of skims. I only wish they came in more colors.",

The 3x will fit a size 24 plus size max and that's if you don't mind a crop. They are SUPER soft and I plan on ordering more in the black color, but these are super short. If you have a large bust (I'm 48DD) they will JUST fit you. I also have a long torso, these JUST hit my high waisted leggings. I'm also 5'8\" for height reference. I love these tops, but I hope in the future they come out with a 4x and more colors for the plus sizes.",

Although I am going to say something negative about it on a personal level, something that I wasn't thinking about and as you can see it's got nothing to do with how I rated the product. On me the arms are a little tight, or perhaps I should say snug, and I seem to be pulling on the sleeves a lot. Although by doing that the material has a tendency to grab my hair on my arms and give it a discomfort feeling. It doesn't hurt and it does not pitch and I think it's just indicative to any kind of material that fits snug around the arms.Maybe I'm just being a big sissy, although I think I'm going to trim my hair on my arms just a little bit before I wear it the next time. Anyhow I had the same problem with a pair of underarmor compression top that I had. Anyhow just something to think about, all in all I give it a thumbs up, the material is nice and soft and it has a four-way stretch",
