I get a lot of compliments when I wear it out. I will be buying in another color.The only negative thing I have to add is that the inside is not the most comfortable material. It\u2019s not itchy but it\u2019s not soft. The outside is however, soft.I would recommend this flannel.",

First of all it\u2019s so soft and it\u2019s not so thick where you can\u2019t like wear it indoors with a shirt underneath it and feel too hot. I hate that I hate that about the winter time when layering just gets to be too much and you\u2019re sweating everywhere you go so this is a very thin but still, it\u2019s very warm so I would recommend this flannel to anyone it\u2019s gorgeous it\u2019s soft and like I said you won\u2019t sweat in it but you will keep warm, I recommend it to anyone",

                "reviewText": "I was skeptical to purchase this shacket with some of the mixed reviews, however I decided to go for it. I really like the shacket. I've got several compliments and it is super comfortable. One con is that the one arm is noticeably shorter than the other. I have to turn the cuff up on one arm, and the other arm is the perfect length....so quality control may not be the highest of caliber. I kind of agree with the one person who said she kind of wished it was either a bit longer or a bit shorter. I'm a shorter person at 5'2\" so it feels a bit long on me, but if I compare to the picture, it is exactly the length on the model, so it matches the advertised product. I'm certain nobody has noticed the sleeves except for me.",

Very little thought was put into making this jacket. Don\u2019t waste your money! Trying to return it. Seems I have to pay postage back for a defective jacket. I\u2019ll prob just trash it rather than lose more money into it. Just not worth it.",
