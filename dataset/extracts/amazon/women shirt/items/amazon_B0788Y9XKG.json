                "reviewText": "I'm 5'5 with a C bust and wear a medium in almost every style of button down shirt. The medium fit me fine in this shirt, but the shirt was extremely long - hitting me a few inches above the knee! This shirt would be great tied up as shown in the picture or tucked into pants if you don't mind the fabric bunched up in your pants, but you definitely can't wear it untucked unless you're going for the super long look. Good quality, but I'll unfortunately need to return it due to the length. Also, the bottom edge of the shirt is unfinished (raw hem) so that's another reason it doesn't really look right untucked.",
