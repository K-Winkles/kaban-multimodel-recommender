Some of the reviews mentioned the sizes run small so I ordered one size up and it does fit. But one thing to be aware of is that this is a cotton/polyester blend, so it is a bit clingy. It's also a little bit see-through, unlike 100% cotton. But it's not too see-through. Otherwise, it's fine.Update: I ordered four shirts at the same time, and the other three just got delivered. The white one is fine, but the two pink and one blue shirt are very dull in color. The colors shown are not the colors you'll end up with. Both the pink shirts and the blue shirt look very grayish, as if they had been washed with something black that leaked color all over them, you know what I mean? I can't think of a better way to explain that.I'm sure the dark colors like the dark green and navy blue are fine. And I'm sure the gray is fine. But if you are looking to get pastels, you should look at different shirts. These will be a disappointment.",

By the feel of the material, sweat will definitely sit and stay.I wear a 12/14 blazer and this top is huge. Loose across the chest (D), loose across the waist and hips. At 5\u20193\u201d, the hemline falls just at or below my natural hip.Good value for the money if used as a layering piece under a jacket or cardigan, but not for athletic wear. Be sure to size down a full size for a loose fit and possibly two, for a fitted look.Will be returning.",
