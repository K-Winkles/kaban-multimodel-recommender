                "reviewText": "When this shirt first arrived in the mail, I wasn't particularly impressed. It didn't look or feel like i expected based on the pictures when i ordered it so I put it in my closet and forgot about it for a while to let some of the wrinkles fall out. Since I do try to review most products that i order, I decided to go ahead and steam out some of the biggest wrinkles and try it on. Once I had it on, my opinion changed 100%!! It's nice and flowy and comfortable. It is an oversized shirt so I wasn't expecting it to be particularly flattering but I felt good in it! In my photos, I had pushed the sleeves up a bit out of habit which didn't do it any justice but worth noting the sleeves are full length with very wide elastic bands at the wrists. They are snug but not uncomfortably so and there's a good amount of stretch. Also worth noting, this shirt is not at all see-through despite the white background which is very rare, in my opinion. In short, I regret not giving this a chance sooner! i will be wearing it starting now!!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this top hoping to wear it to a fine dining establishment on our beach vacation. This is such a versatile top; perfect for the office, a night out, brunch, casual afternoon and so much more. The material is lightweight and breathable, while feeling cool against the skin. The sizing is true to size, but fits a bit oversized- which is exactly what I prefer. The sleeves are fitted and quite stretchy, which I thought was unique and different from my other traditional collared button-down tops. I also really appreciate the material not being overly thick, as it makes it much easier to wear tucked or untucked, without excessive bulk.",

                "reviewText": "Ok I am a little obsessed with this top! Yes, it needs a good steaming out of the packaging, but let\u2019s try to look beyond that for a sec. The fabric is light and oh so soft! Like a button down you\u2019ve had for years and just keep reaching for it because it\u2019s worn in perfectly. You get that feeling right from the get go with this top. The sleeves add such a dramatic touch. You can lift them a bit for an exaggerated puff at the arm or leave them pulled down, it looks just as interesting. The best part, wait for it\u2026 it has pockets!!! Such a welcome surprise! I was feeling around for what was on the sides of the top, and when I realized it was pockets, I could hardly contain myself!! I\u2019m obsessed! This top will be so cute tucked into jeans or trousers, or left out for a more casual look. I\u2019m normally a medium, and I did order a medium here, and I feel it fits perfectly with just the right amount of slouch that you look for in a button down. I love it!",
