The navy one has a strong color that did not fade anterior ~20 laundry cycles (always using laundry liquid and condicioner for black/colored clothes). They might wrinkle just a bit, but if you dry them in a dryer, they go out wrinkle free. I don't mind some wrinkles due to fabric textur, so I prefer to air dry on a ruber-covered hanger, I also use a wrinkle-guard fabrics conditioner and it works fine for me.The fabric is soft and yet not too warm, making these tops a perfect choice for hot summer days, and any other season as the first layer.These are long enough for some styling like adding a belt (exactly as shown on the photo), and the armpits are somewhat deep, so the underwear may be seen when you raise your hands.",

                "reviewText": "I love this shirt, it's comfortable and breathable. It does wrinkle fairly easily though so it's best to hang though it's still not always wrinkle-free. It does not have any stretch, though it's cut to be loose and quite flattering. I love the colour, though it is a little darker and brighter than it appears in the picture.",

                "reviewText": "I read some reviews about the fabric being heavy, and I was reluctant to try as a result. I decided to try the blouse because it\u2019s exactly what I had in mind, and I think it\u2019s a really nice quality. The fabric is substantial enough to not be see through, but I don\u2019t find it to be too heavy. It\u2019s appropriate for work, and still drapes nicely. I am very pleased with it!! It does run a little large. I would normally wear a medium in a blouse for work and ordered a small. It still had plenty of fabric.",
