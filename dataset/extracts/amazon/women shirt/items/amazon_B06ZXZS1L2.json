I will be ordering another in a smaller size because other then the size issue the shirt is nice and light which is what I was wanting in a summer work shirt. I'm definitely going to use the Amazon try before you buy option this time. Also it doesn't have the typical womens cut it's more straight and doesn't have the curve in the waist.",

                "reviewText": "Absolutely nothing wrong with the shirt itself. It's soft, super comfortable and fits very well, and the color is perfect. Very happy with that. However, the packaging (and I use that term VERY loosely) was a flimsy clear bag that most clothing items are put in *before* they're put into a stronger bag. It says 'less packaging, more smiles' on the bag, but I was NOT happy. I don't think it's safe to ship something in a bag that could very easily tear/rip and the item inside to get lost or torn too. More than that, though, is that there is zero privacy with this packaging, and this is not the first Hanes item from Amazon I've ordered that's been packaged like this. As someone who values privacy and has dealt with nosy delivery people, this is unacceptable. Thankfully, it wasn't any personal items I've ordered that have been shipped like this.Tl;dr: if you order anything from Hanes on Amazon, however personal your item(s) may be, he aware it may ship to you in a clear bag, which everyone can see the contents. Use any gift packing or privacy packaging options you can, just in case.",

                "reviewText": "I love the materiel of this shirt. It's not heavy weight but it's not light weight either. I'm 5'4 and 170lbs and carry most of my weight in my torso (stomach and tits). I normally wear size XL for the most part so that's what I ordered. The length is great but it's a tight fit. It may just be the style of the shirt - made to be form fitting - but I would've probably been more comfortable in a xxl(2x) or higher. Won't be returning but will be saving until I drop some weight.Hope this helps",
