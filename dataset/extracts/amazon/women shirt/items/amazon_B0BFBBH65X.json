When I tried these on they were SO CUTE and pretty that I wanted them to wear under my tops and sweaters for a base or just a top in summer. They look so expensive and classy. Like a very high-end top. I have a 4-year degree and this doesn't look like the price tag if that helps anyone gauge what types of clothes I choose. I didn't show cleavage on me but I didn't size it that way and that isn't how i wear my clothes. They are kind of thick which is why I like these tops so much. Some might not like that for exercise. I don't think I would wear this top necessarily for gym wear, just because they look too nice. I don't typically wear thick square neck cream-colored tops to the gym in the area where I live. It is more of an old t-shirt culture here. But not to say some places aren't like that. Who knows. Very happy. I would have ordered more but the color/size combo was sold out.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, it's not a bad shaper and does well. Gives a nice silhouette and definitely good compression. My separated stomach muscles felt very supported in this. My heavy breasts felt supported also which was shocking because the shoulder straps are too large. It didn't create skin/fat rolls spilling out the top which happens in some shapers so that's great but also a bit of a negative because:The top was a little too large and the bottom is very small. \ud83d\ude02 It's like the M/L size is literally the bottom is Medium (or small, hello compression) and the top is a Large. The shoulder straps are actually too big on me and that's one of the reasons I'm returning it.I'm a 32-34DD, 160 lbs, and 5'2\" with petite shoulders, a little waist, and wide hips with thicc thighs. I'm also super short waisted.This compression tank was very long on me, went down passed my booty. Could be a good thing if it had a sticky edge at the bottom to keep it in place.The ribbed section is itchy and I don't usually order anything ribbed because it always feels itchy to me so I may have missed that part when I ordered this and that is not necessarily an issue with the product but my own sensitivities.The bottom rolls up when you sit. This could be because it's too long on my shirt body. There is no sticky edge to hold it down so just be aware of that. It does seem to stay in place if you're standing and walking around.With my shorter and smaller natural waist, it bunched up there a lot. Not a problem with the product really but if you're curvy with a small waist, or are also short waisted like I am, it could be an issue for you too. I don't know which reason it bunches right there.",
