                "reviewText": "Ordered the shirt late Nov. 17th and received it on afternoon of Nov. 27th. No problems with packaging. Washed the shirt that same day and wore it a few days later with black leggings. I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d and I ordered XXL I believe and it hits about 4-5\u201d from top of my knee. It has two outside pockets (yay!) and is made of the softest material ever! It is comfortable to wear\u2026 love the peach/pink/coral color\u2026Nothing is perfect and this shirt, too, has a flaw: it does wrinkle easily. I bought the spray wrinkle stuff and it did the trick w/o a problem, so an easy fix (rather than throwing in the dryer).Loved the shirt so much I bought another a few days later and I\u2019ve yet to receive it. According to my inquiry, I won\u2019t see it for another 3-4 weeks as it\u2019s coming from Hong Kong. How I got the first one in less than 10 days and this new one is going to take 6 weeks is beyond me\u2026 (ordered from same exact place\u2026 only changed the color of the shirt: 2 tone gray) so you may want to be aware of that. If I receive it before then, I\u2019ll update this post.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great lightweight tunic for warmer weather. It\u2019s a lightweight T-shirt material that feels very soft. The fabric is a bit lighter weight than the picture lead me to expect but it is a solid T-shirt fabric, not too thin or sheer at all. However, the brown color is darker than the picture.Pros: great soft T-shirt fabric. Although the material is a polyester/rayon blend, it feels like Pima cotton. It\u2019s nice and long, well suited for wearing with leggings.Cons: I ordered the color A1 Brown, which looks like a dark taupe online - e.g. a greyish tan to me - but IRL it\u2019s a solid chocolate brown. Nice color, just not what I expected. The fabric is a lighter weight than I expected, so it doesn\u2019t drape the way the picture lead me to believe but still nice and not at all too thin or sheer. If you look at the picture the sleeve stands away from the upper arm, hence my expectation of a thicker fabric.Shipping speed: It also took a long time to arrive. The shipping notes had said it usually ships in 8 to 10 days but mine took 5 weeks.",

I needed a t-shirt to wear around the house and for when I needed to run outside and back quickly. I chose this one because it\u2019s the longest t-shirt I could find on Amazon. I wanted a really long t-shirt so that I can run outside quickly (like to go to my recycling bin) without (dare I say it) having to wear shorts; this one does the trick. I\u2019m really happy with the fabric - very, very soft; very comfortable. Others have commented that the fabric is too thin, but I don\u2019t find that to be the case at all. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to wear it shopping, eating out, going to the post office, etc. I like it so much that I plan to buy more in other colors.",
