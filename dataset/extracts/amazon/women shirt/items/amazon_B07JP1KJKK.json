And my day got better when I went to a restaurant and turned some heads. At 62, that doesn''t happen very often. I don't know what the magic is to how they designed this shirt but it fit perfectly and and was slimming. I purchased the wider black and white stripe one and whether it's the stripes or the way it's made, I looked slimmer and better than I have in ages. The weight of the fabric is perfect, it feels good on. Honestly, I don't know when I've bought something that felt expensive but was this low of a price. The boat neck is so flattering, the sleeve length is perfect. I then purchased two more striped options and I love them too. I would ask that Amazon consider making this shirt just like the wider black and white stripe in other colors. I would purchase them all.",
