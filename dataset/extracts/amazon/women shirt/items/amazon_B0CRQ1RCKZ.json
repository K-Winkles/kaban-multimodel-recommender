They are correct about the looseness. See my picture with the buttons showing. See down the side how wide it is. I am just able to get into 2X most of the time, and this is pretty loose. Take that into consideration when selecting size when you purchase this shirt.The shirt has stretch side to side only.I recommend this shirt. It is comfortable and feels good to the touch.",

My wife likes the boxiness of this shirt. The seams are all finished nicely, the hem has about 4\" slits on the side which are a nice touch. The sleeves are slightly bat-wing and the v-neck has 5 functioning buttons. The band on the hem is about 2 inches deep and is flattering. This is a great casual shirt to pair with shorts or jeans. The price seems right on this one. It's 75% polyester, 25% cotton and has a more cottony hand-feel. No special laundering requirements, no bleach. The fabric is a great springtime blend, might be too warm for the dog days of summer.",

Unfortunately, I should have picked a size smaller, because it just looks too big on me. I would recommend choosing a size down, because it seems to run big. The top is made of good quality material and is well-made. Other than the size, it\u2019s a nice top.",

                "reviewText": "I like this top. I ordered a 3X, normally I am either a 2X or 3X and this fit well. The top is not too big and fits somewhat loose which is how I prefer my tops. There is a band at the bottom of the top but since there slits on the sides the band does not make the shirt snug at the bottom. I like how it has the buttons in the front so you can decided how you want the neckline. I machine washed this top and it washed very well. It is very comfortable to wear. I am very happy with the top and would order again!",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice looking shirt to wear to the gym and it also looks great with a simple blue blazer and jeans for a night out. It is a nice length (short for a tunic for me at 5'7\"), but still longer and the side slits and drop shoulders make it hang nicely. It isn't clingy at all. The sleeves are elbow length and the V-neck and waffle knit give it a slimming profile. It washed well and didn't stretch out; hanging to dry meant no ironing!The only minor issue was that it ran a little big, making it loose fitting but not boxy. Plan to get it in black!",

The top is priced about where I'd expect it to be.",
