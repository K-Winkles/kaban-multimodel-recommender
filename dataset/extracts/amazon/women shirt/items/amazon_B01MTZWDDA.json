The material is not too thick or thin. The length is great; it reaches about midway my butt and looks good with my leggings. Because I am getting older my arms have a little jiggle so the quarter length sleeves make me feel more comfortable. It comes in a variety of colors and I love the color I purchased but because it fits and feels so nice then I plan to buy several more. It smelled fine and was wearable as soon as I opened the package. I didn\u2019t notice much, if any shrinkage after being washed.",

                "reviewText": "I had a Hanes shirt I had purchased about 10 years ago and absolutely loved (still going strong!), but it\u2019s finally starting to fade from black to that obviously faded color. It suddenly dawned on me that I should see if that style was still made - we\u2019re talking Hanes here so not a company influenced heavily by the trends - or at least something similar. I found this which looked like it was made of the same comfy, durable, fabric and similar fit with roughly the same neckline and 3/4 length sleeves - all boxes checked plus a killer price! Based on the TruFit model info, I should have ordered the Large (I\u2019m roughly a 12) but I always order up a size because of upper arm issues and I\u2019m not fond of things clinging to my body - I love the comfort of a bit of spandex, but not how it looks when outlining my muffin top! I saw a few reviews saying it ran a bit small and looked at the photos and decided to order up 2 sizes, knowing this fabric and cut (assuming they were as I expected) would be very forgiving on sizing.My XXL came and it was perfect. Same fabric, same sort of fit as my old shirt. If I had the body of my youth and was fine with a more form-fitting top, the L would be a great fit. With my arm issues, the XL would absolutely have fit me and I\u2019d have been happy with it. But the XXL was very comfy and just floats over my body in the middle without being overly loose in the shoulders or hips, the two places it actually contacts the body. It just hangs more in a straight line without accenting the dreaded bulge. With my extra 10+ pandemic pounds, this was exactly what was needed!The fabric is soft and substantial - not at all thin or see-through - and has enough stretch to be comfortable and allow a good fit in several sizes, depending on how tight or loose a top you prefer, flaws you wish to disguise, etc. It\u2019s well-constructed and basic enough to be worn on its own (no jacket) with scarves or jewelry to dress it up a bit, plainer for more casual, and can be layered under sweaters, etc without lots of lumps or discomfort. Length is about mid to lower hip depending on your height and how you chose to size the top. Had I bought the size intended by TruFit, it would definitely have been mid-hip. Two sizes up and it was lower but still not bum-covering enough for leggings IMO.I was happy enough with it that I ordered 3 more.",

It does not cling the way a lot of materials do these days, making it much more flattering. But it does run small, probably because the material doesn't have much stretch, but the manufacturer should've allowed for this, instead of making it for one of these very stretchy, thin, cheap materials that so many garments are made of nowadays. I think clothes makers have forgotten how to make clothes with good material and to fit the way they're supposed to.",

Let me say that I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d, 112 lbs, and wear a 36A bra. Basically, I\u2019m on the small size and flat-chested. lol. The shirts fit nicely around my shoulders and the length is good, but the shirts are **snug** around my chest. I thought, Okay I\u2019ll go up a size, so I bought a L in the pink and heather. They came, I washed, and tried on. They are definitely not snug around my chest, but they feel (and look!) to big for me. I guess I need something in between a M and a L, so that means I\u2019m SOL. Oh well, at $11.00/shirt, I\u2019ll wear them to exercise. But I won\u2019t buy any more for jeans, shorts, etc.",

(i use febreeze spray to iron out any wrinkles when i wear an item) You never really know if it's the old Hanes brand that we're used to buying in a store... On Amaz. it always seems like you never get what you see & the fabric sux now... (hard to find cotton anymore) the sizing is always what we read buying a \"hanes\" product & always arrives quick & on time. Good luck",
