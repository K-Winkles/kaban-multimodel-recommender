                "reviewText": "I ordered the blush pink color, but recieved a peach shirt. It also has a straight hem on the bottom, not rounded like the picture. I usually wear a medium, but ordered a large for a loose fit. I think a med would've fit better though, because it's very boxy. Also the fabric is stiff and scratchy like a very basic undershirt. Not like the soft cotton I was expecting at all",
