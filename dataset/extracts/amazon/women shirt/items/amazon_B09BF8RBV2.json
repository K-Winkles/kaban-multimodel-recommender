                "reviewText": "I was excited to get these in. I ordered it in a grey and a red. I was a little disappointed so I kept the grey and returned the red, I'll explain why. As for how the shirts fit , I loved how soft they are and slightly long in the arms making it appealing and cozy. It really has a nice fit and a I could easily make it like a sexy indoor girl type of look or wear it as a lounge shirt. As I mentioned, I like how it fits everywhere except one area, my stomach. I just find that it's the only place that isn't form fitting, so it's a little loose in the stomach area then the stitching around the bottom of the shirt is tight, sorry it's the only way I can think of to describe it. The bottom of the shirt doesn't lay nicely nor is it fitting. None the less it doesn't look bad, just need to pair it with the right pants, definitely not leggings but that's for so many reasons as it's not nearly long enough and the material is completely off for that type of get up in my opinion. On the other hand, it looks fabulous with a pair of boot cut, straight let, or skinny jeans! The red shirt, was simply a brighter shade of red then I was expecting and I didn't find it that flattering. I am glad, even many washes and drys later that I kept the grey one. It has held up very nicely, so it's definitely made well, still looks the same since the first day I received it!",

                "reviewText": "It was as expected, they run very large though, I\u2019m normally a medium so the first time I thought one of these in brown I got a medium and had to exchange it for a small because the medium is like an XL to be honest, but had no issues exchanging it. So I got the small in brown and now the small in black, they\u2019re my go to shirts now. I wore the brown one to an interview and got the job, so hey! I like them because they remind me of the style of shirts I saw a lot in the early 2000\u2019s-2010\u2019s. Like the kind you see Elena wear in vampire diaries a lot. They make my arms look skinny and long, which I like, a lot of shirts have too short of arms but not these, they\u2019re nice and long. The fabric is comfy and ribbed like in the pictures. It\u2019s hard to get a piece of clothes that looks like the online photos now days but these do!!!! I\u2019m too lazy to get up and take a photo sorry, but I bought a second one so obviously they\u2019re good.",
