I'm 5'6, 140 lbs and normally wear a large because I like to have extra room at the hips. This large gave me lots of room! Not a bad thing, just something to be aware of. Honestly, the only thing I don't like is that the label on the back (which is some kind of rubbery type substance about an inch and a half square) sticks to my skin when I sweat. And that's being a little nit-picky, I know, but it is the only thing I don't like about this shirt.",
