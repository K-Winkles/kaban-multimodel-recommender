                "reviewText": "The tank is nice - the fabric is a thicker, almost sweater-type fabric, so it's more substantial than a normal tank top and it's really soft. I tried it on when I first got it - I'm 5'1\" 103 lbs and ordered a small. I was bummed that it was a little boxy on me and not as fitted around the waist as I would like. I washed and dried it and it helped a little bit (ie shrunk it slightly on purpose), but it's still a little bigger than I prefer; if they offered an x-small, I bet it would be perfect.",

                "reviewText": "When this tank arrived, I immediately opened it to try it on but before I even pulled it all the way out, I was floored by the softness of the high quality material. I ordered it with the plan to use it a layering piece bc in the pictures it looked like a basic tank, but irl it is far from a \u201cbasic\u201d tank.To start with, this tank feels like it\u2019s knitted & not with basic yarn. It feels like it\u2019s made with ridiculously soft yarn. The tank is a bit thicker than your basic layering tank, but not in a bad way. It\u2019s just thick enough to hold its shape & to keep it from being see through. This tank can easily be dressed up & the contrasting trim gives a classic look. In my opinion, it looks like it\u2019s supposed to be the tank part of a sweater set & would pair nicely with a black or white cardigan or even a blazer. But you can absolutely dress it down as well paired with jeans, leggings, shorts, really it goes w pretty much anything & everything.Looking at the pictures,I thought it was a black ribbed tank with the white border being a totally separate piece, but I was wrong. The bottom hem is white as well as the neckline & the arm holes, but the black tank, along with all of the white details are one solid piece that just flow together, probably bc it\u2019s knitted. It gives the tank a really great high end look. I feel like this tank would easily fit in on the racks of the \u201cWhite House Black Market\u201d stores bc it has a very similar aesthetic.I highly recommend this tank, it\u2019s absolutely gorgeous in person & the pictures don\u2019t do it justice. Not to mention that it seems to be very well made & it\u2019s incredibly soft on the skin as well. This is a solid staple for any wardrobe & will quickly become a go to piece. If you\u2019re on the fence I say go for it, you won\u2019t be disappointed.",

It's almost a crop top for someone like me.I am so bummed out too because the fabric is so soft and stretchy. The piping is really lovely and the shirt itself is great! But I would order your normal size or maybe even size down if you want a fitted shirt.The best part of this top though is the bag it comes in is reusable and resealable! What an awesome idea and so environmentally friendly. Kudos to the manufacturer for doing that.",

It is made of a fine-gauge knit polyester blend, and is nice and soft with no itching. The seams are finished well, too.This tank runs true-to-size and has a nice amount of stretch: bigger busts take note that this fit the girls well! I wear 32DDD, and I could order my regular size (small).I like that this too is cute to wear for a variety of occasions, from casual to workwear! A great feature that makes it possible to style in many ways is that the straps fully cover a regular bra. Such a nice feature to not feel sloppy with poor coverage and my straps escaping!Another reason this would be great for work is that the knit is well-done and looks polished, neat, and the threads are nice with rich coverage.I also love the bold black and white of this shirt!I recommend!",

The material is nice and soft, not at all itchy. It is not too thin and not too thick. I love the black lining around the neck, it dresses this top up.For size reference, i am 5\u20192 & 100lbs. I ordered a small it comes a little loose on me, but it doesn\u2019t look bad. I usually like a tighter fit, but being on the small side, the majority of my small size shirts come loose on me. I usually wear XS but they don\u2019t make it.I still highly recommend this tank top sweater and would love to purchase other colors as well.Please heart if you found my review being at all helpful! \ud83e\udd0d",
