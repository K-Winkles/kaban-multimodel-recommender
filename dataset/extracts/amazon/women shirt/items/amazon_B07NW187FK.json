                "reviewText": "I purchased two of these shirts in different colors, and really liked them out of the package. When I tried them on, they fit well and were flattering. The material is clingy but very stretchy. I had previously tried a size Large, but exchanged for an X-large in both for a bit more room and to not cling so much to my body. Before washing they were a perfect fit, but after washing they have shrunk a size even though I followed the washing directions on the tag. I am on the fence about returning as I am working to loose weight and really did like these shirts. They were nice enough to wear casually or at work, which is business casual/relaxed professional.",
