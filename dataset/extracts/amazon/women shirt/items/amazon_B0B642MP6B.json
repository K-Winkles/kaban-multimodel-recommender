Does not feel rough. The one I received feels soft. Does not feel cheap. It\u2019s a loose fit. I ordered a small and I\u2019m usually a true small in everything. Note: cannot wear an XSmall and medium is too big for me. It hits mid thigh on me and 5 feet tall for reference. I hope this helps someone!",

We both ordered one and bought another because it is so cozy and stylish. At first I thought I\u2019d have a problem because I\u2019m short (5ft) but the length is just right for me. It\u2019s warm but not too thick so I don\u2019t know how long I can get away with wearing it as a jacket, but either way it will be in my wardrobe weekly. I am 130lbs and I got a medium which is perfect. My cousins are thinking of all getting one to wear for a Christmas card. I didn\u2019t love the price, but it\u2019s worth it, so get ahead and buy it!",

                "reviewText": "For reference I am 5'2\" and 125lbs and I got size small pink/grey color. I love it, but gave 4 stars because inside is a bit scratchy and the pockets don't look like the picture. I washed it in cold and dried it on low with 2 fabric softeners and it's not scratchy on the inside now, but not as soft as the outside! The outside fabric is very soft. It is a great thickness. Not flimsy. Collar lays nicely. When buttoned up the plaids match nicely! Perfect length to cover my backside. Will order more in other colors. I'm happy I got it! Hope this helps others decide.",

The seams appear to be strong. Nice",

It\u2019s just been my go to outfit all the time. Highly recommend. If fits loose which is what I wanted. Super long and can wear with tights",

Yes it's supposed to be oversized and I had planned to wear it like a jacket it but it was way too big. Sometimes women's larges aren't large enough so I really didn't thing it would be too big. I was wrong. It was too big all around and honestly, the color and pattern was NOT the same as the pic. It was thick/heavy enough to be warm enough for most of the cool weather experienced in the south. I had plans to return in. It was too much money to be too big and not the color/pattern I intended to purchase. Luckily my mom liked it and she liked they fit. Otherwise I would have returned it in a heartbeat",
