Not available in my size (M) on Levi's website, or Kohl's, or Penney's, etc. Found it on Amazon...cool. I usually wear a size small but ordered medium for Fall weather to accommodate an undershirt. Arrived very promptly (in it's original see through plastic wrapping with a shipping label slapped on it) no outer envelope, padded envelope, box, nada. Luckily it was in fine shape. It fits well, but a bit slim in the bust where the snap buttons fit just above & below the girth of my bust so there's a gap right where you don't want one. My bust is regular but old, so maybe it would be a better fit on a young gal who hasn't felt the tragedy of gravity & age yet? Overall, the quality is 100% Levi, the fabric is exactly what I like about the brand.",
