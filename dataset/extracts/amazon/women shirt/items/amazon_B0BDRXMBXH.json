I am usually a 10-12. Very soft, comfortable, and flattering. Can use as a shirt on its own, or over any shirt, etc. Love the feel and how it lays. The buttons look great. Receive many compliments when I wear any of them. The sweater/shirt washes well and dries quickly. I washed it in cold water and casual setting and laid out to dry. it did not take long to dry. Because of it's lightness, great for layering. I am so very happy with purchase.",

                "reviewText": "This is actually something I gave thought about returning. I love the shirt itself! Super cute. I put it on and instantly feel cozy. As other reviews have mentioned, the waffle weave itself is on the looser side. Not see through, but sheer enough that some would want something underneath for sure. Its lightweight but still warm enough. On one hand I like the fabric and I put the shirt on and feel comfy, but it almost reminds me of pajama material? I got the pink in XL. I typically buy XL or XXL in both men's and women's, so I am a fan of the oversized shirt. Still, I think I would like this better if I got a smaller size and maybe even a different color. I like the pink and it's a bubblegum pink without being too bright. Between the material, the color and the size I think the combo is the issue. $32 seems steep for what this is. Saying that, I'm also debating what color I should try next, so there is something about the shirt I'm willing to keep trying. If it went on sale I would buy several colors. Alot of contradictions here, but it was just that kind of shirt, lol. Update: it does shrink in the dryer. Not much but the sleeves just come to my wrist now. Unless the price was really good I doubt I would get this again. Just not my style. I\u2019ve worn it a few times and just don\u2019t love it. It seems to be clingy and I find myself adjusting it a lot. Granted I\u2019m using it unbuttoned for the most part as a top layer.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered a medium in this shirt based on other reviews and glad I did! Fits perfect. The sleeves as mentioned by others however do run short. Overall length of the shirt is great for jeans or leggings. Light weight waffle knit, soft and airy. Would order in other colours. I am 5\u20196\u201d, 150 lbs and DD bust. I recommend.",
