                "reviewText": "I was really pleased with this tunic tank when it arrived. I usually sit between a L and an XL for tops, and seeing the pics with the flowy fit, I went with the L (and I\u2019m glad I did). It fit really nicely in the chest area -- the extra elastic both helps keep it from gapping like some tunic tanks I have and gives it a bit more character in how it lays. The loose and flowy fit means it lays nicely over my hip and tummy area. I also liked the color -- I ordered the teal blue, and although I would say I felt it was more of a steel blue, I thought the color was nice, and it goes well for me with both dark capris or dark leggings. It\u2019s very lightweight without being see-through at all, so it breathes well for me, and it goes nicely under a lightweight cardigan or flannel if I need an extra layer. I\u2019ve put it through the wash (delicate, cold cycle, hang dry), and it came through just fine. Overall I\u2019m happy with this casual tank.",

                "reviewText": "This tank top is very well made with great design features, like the rounded V-neck, wide straps (no sleeves), ruched sides (under ribs on either side) and long flowy hemline. However, the XXL is HUGE! I order a lot online and usually the XXL works for me, but this one is enormous, I can\u2019t wear it. It\u2019s more like a 4X in my honest opinion. Which is great for body positivity and being more inclusive with sizing, I fully support that! But I ordered the size according to their size chart, and it\u2019s at least 2 sizes larger than I expected based on their chart. I can\u2019t speak to the other sizes but I would recommend this to plus size women, not petite or smaller size women. I consider myself the low end of plus size, but I\u2019m disappointed in all the extra fabric used for this shirt. I love the shirt & wish I could wear it! It\u2019s an awesome shirt! Just be careful with sizing! I would have returned it but I gave it to my mom who can wear it instead.",

I missed the part of the description that said loose fit, so that is my fault. I normally wear a medium or large and ordered a large. I wish I would have ordered the medium. The material is well made and is not sheer but is lightweight. The top is comfortable, and I expect that it will hold up very well, as all my Baleaf clothing has.",

The fit on this tunic is great, I appreciate that even though it is plus-sized, the armpits aren't so huge that they expose the entire side of my body. The drape is great, a bit of a very forgiving \"swing\" at the bottom, and the length is perfect for me (I'm 5\"8'). The material is light and breathable, but not see through. This is a wonderful athleisure tank, great for the gym, sleeping in and as a layering piece in cooler weather. I love the blue color as well. I think that the price is a bargain for the quality of what you get.",

Not fully there, but feel like I am now on the \"plus size\". I am 5'8 \" 175lb and wear a size 12 and have a full bust. Finding clothes that are comfy and flattering has been tough lately. I wasn't really looking or expecting this to be flattering. I was just looking for something practical to wear to physical therapy after shoulder surgery. To my surprise this is both comfy, practical and flattering. Price is comparable to other similar tops, but I feel that it would be a better seller at a price point between $15-$17 rather than the current price of $20. Other than the recommendation on price, I have no complaints.",
