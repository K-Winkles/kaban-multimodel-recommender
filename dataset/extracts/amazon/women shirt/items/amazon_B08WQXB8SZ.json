                "reviewText": "I love most Amazon Essentials clothing, and I really love this shirt! While this is NOT a flannel shirt, it's a good quality cotton shirt that has a nice drape to it and is not sheer.I'm 5ft-3in, and my measurements are 36-29-36. At my height, this shirt hits me just at the top of my thighs/mid rear. I purchased a small and it fits me perfectly. It's neither tight or loose.I think I could have even purchased an XS for a more \"fitted\" look, since I always wear a white tank tops underneath, so I'd still be able to wear it even if I wasn't able button the second button.I purchased the black/white, gradient/plaid and plan on getting other colors later on.Although it's not a \"fitted\" shirt style, it doesn't look sloppy either. (It doesn't look boxy and shapeless on me.) This shirt is made with good quality fabric that is soft, but doesn't appear to fade or shrink after washing.I wash it in cool or warm water (regular or gentle cycle) and either hang up to dry, or place in the dryer on a low setting. When immediately pulled out from the dryer after it stops, it requires little to no ironing.The shirt itself looks polished with no sign of wear (I've worn it several months so far, and the colors haven't faded and the fabric looks the same as when I purchased it). It can be worn tucked-in with business slacks, or casually untucked with jeans.This shirt is perfect for spring or summer weather because it's a nice cool cotton. The fabric on this shirt is not thick, it's not see-through, and definitely not thin. It's just a nice quality fabric that drapes nicely and doesn't easily wrinkle.It has a very flattering fit. The seams are nicely sewn as well. It looks great, keeps its shape and color after washing, and the fabric is nice and soft. The pattern, colors, and texture have a good quality to them.I'm very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend. I'd like to get several more colors later on!",

The ad says they are flannel but they are more like a quality cotton. I ordered three of them the second time around and I know I will wear them a lot. I am a Sr. Citizen with gray hair and the red plaid shirt is very striking.",

The fabric is fairly lightweight, which I don\u2019t really mind where I live, but don\u2019t expect it to be warm, heavy flannel. It is 100% cotton, which I like, but cotton wrinkles so just know that the shirt looks best when ironed. My only real complaint is that I ordered my usual size and the body of the shirt is quite wide, making it look a bit sloppy. Since it fits across my shoulders (which are average width), I don\u2019t think I could size down. However, I like the blue plaid and that the sleeves are roomy and nice and long, so I\u2019m not unhappy with the purchase, just a little disappointed I won\u2019t be ordering in another color.",
