                "reviewText": "I LOVE the material, fit, and the look!! The seams are hidden connecting the color panels and well done, and sewn straight. My skin is very sensitive to clothing material, seams, tags, etc. due to a condition I have. I break out in hives easily. I have no issues with this which says A LOT. There are double seams you can see at the bottom of the sleeves and the bottom of the shirt but they match the shirt so they are not obvious and I don't feel them. The pink is not see-through. This is super soft like a t-shirt but better. The colors are vibrant and the gray is a traditional sweatshirt type heather gray. The blue amd pink are not Heather. I bought the next size up so it would not be clingy and because though you can't tell in the picture I have some bat wing loose skin on my arms from weight loss and this fits them perfectly going up one size. I really debated doing this when I ordered but I'm really glad I did.Some people have said in reviews that the seam came across their chest and cut through where their bra is and was awkward or uncomfortable but mine hits in the right place. Maybe they are bustier than I am or they are taller. I'm short at 5'2\" and weigh 160 lbs. so it stands to reason that if someone is much taller the panels are going to hit differently.I am about to order more colors because I don't like how short sleeve shirts look on me and this is so comfortable and fits so nicely. Also, my skin burns easily so this adds some protection. To me, it is flattering without screaming athletic wear for everyday wear and it's not too dressy at the gym for casual physical therapy. This pairs perfectly with jeans or nice leggings or athletic leggings. I don't think I will get too warm because I will not be doing cardio for the type of physical therapy I am in.I highly recommend this shirt!! Again, if you don't have thin arms you may wish to go up a side, especially if you are on the border between the sizes by measurement. The same probably applies with your body measurement. I didn't want that too tight. It isn't too loose either. Depending on your body type, height, body shape, and proportions, your results may vary. I know shopping online is difficult but they have free returns which helped me decide.If my review was helpful, please give me a thumbs up. Thank you!",

The only thing I don't really like is the knot on the bottom. But the length of the sleeves and the shirt as a whole is perfect. It fits well, doesn't bother me at the neck. The colors are very pretty and bold. Although, someone did tell me I was wearing San Diego Chargers colors, and being from Northern California they thought that I was rooting for the wrong team but I just really like the color yellow...",

They actually contain a lot of stretch however, and the material was thicker than I'd anticipated which was a pleasant surprise. I'd say these are super versatile thanks to their non see-through material, and I'd wear the seamless set as loungewear but also in the gym.",
