I have purchased 13 or 14 of these short sleeve shirts (and a few long sleeve which I quickly realized wasn\u2019t going to work for a job in Charleston, SC) These shirts wash & dry well, sometimes need a minute whack of the hand steamer\u2026 the best part of the shirt is that the top button that closes at your neck has about an inch stretchy band connected to the button, so you don\u2019t ever feel like you\u2019re being choked out! I know this seems minuscule, but it\u2019s a game changer for someone that has to wear these shirts for 60+ hours a week! 7000 thumbs up for this shirt, just buy it! Stains wash away easily, it\u2019s relatively breathable & stays looking crisp for all of service. I purchased & returned over a dozen options before I found this one on Amazon, save yourself the work and just give this shirt a try!! I\u2019m 5\u2019 6\u201d, 140lbs, 32C/D - bigger in my hips / booty than my top half. Medium was a bit bulky for having to tuck it in / wear under a waistcoat, and a small is simply perfection!",
