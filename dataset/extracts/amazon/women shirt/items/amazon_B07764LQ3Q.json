They far exceeded my expectations! Perfect fit, good quality fabric, soft and comfortable, great price! Easy care. They washed well (I machine-washed them in cold water), colors didn't run, and they needed very little ironing at low temperature. I am 5'2\", 144 lbs and am currently between sizes so was undecided between the medium and the large. Glad I opted for the large. This is the first time I've used the Amazon \"Try Before You Buy\" option. I will definitely buy this brand again. I highly recommend this product!",

I went on a hunt to find something that looked the same and had similar fabric content. These tees are great. They are slightly heavier than the tee I was trying to copy, but they have wonderful stretch and are super comfortable. They feel substantial, like they will hold up for a long time. I wash and dry them on cool and so far they work great for me. They didn't shrink with drying on cool. I usually wear a small (4-6) in most things, but I wanted a looser, roomier fit and a medium fit just the way I wanted. I will probably repurchase these in other colors for the spring.",

                "reviewText": "I'm 5'2\", 49yo F with adenomyosis, endometriosis. Currently 195 lbs, due to pandemic inactivity, and cortisol/age weight. Pre-pandemic 135 lbs. I bought these for everyday WFH and sleep shirt. One really can't go wrong with Amazon Basics as far as price for a fairly decent quality material. It's exactly as the brand describes in it's name... Basic. The material is not too thin to the point of being poorly made, neither is it above average quality that will last years. My only reason for giving this particular v-neck shirt set 3 stars is because it's a slimmer/tighter fit in than other XL shirts and tank tops I've purchased, where the XL is very loose and I feel I would have done better with a L for a loose but not too loose fit, or M for a more for fitting fit. The sleeves are very short, about 1.5 inch from inner armpit seam. Due to it being slimmer fitting I find myself constantly trying to pull it out from my pits where it bunches up. For me, personally, that's annoying. Otherwise, it gives way well enough around my bust (36B bra size), waist (size 12-16 depending on adeno/endometriosis bloating) and hips. The shirt falls below the hip and, surprisingly, covers my fupa, :D LOL (bloating or not)! You know what I'm talking about, ladies!To sum it up: True to size if you're looking for form fitting, curvy or slim ladies. If you want something looser or have bigger upper arms, biceps, delts, order up 1 size.",

                "reviewText": "I have a thing about the softness of shirts - if something is slightly not-soft-enough I simply won't wear it. And I of course don't throw it away immediately, but instead I let it sit in my closet for years and years in total denial that I won't wear it until I realize the problem is not how the item looks but how it feels, and then I'm able to part with it... but it's a long and annoying process. The struggle is real.I bought these t-shirts 2 sizes larger than my normal size so I could use them paired with flannel pants for a DIY pajama set. They are perfect and fit my highly sensitive person (HSP) requirement for soft fabrics, so I know they're not going to be neglected in my dresser. If you're a soft shirt person like me and considering these shirts - just go for it. The price is right, and softness is spot-on.I also have a few of these in my normal size for daytime use and they've held up very well in the wash. Thank you, Amazon, for an affordable and well-cut t-shirt with tons of colors to choose from. \u2764\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "While folding laundry I stopped just to leave this review. I am not easy on clothes and these shirts have survived it all without stretching fading or losing their amazing softness. They have survived a full home remodel and all the crafts I manage to get into. There is literally no wear and tear on them at all. I have never had shirts maintain their quality let alone their fit and softness for this long. I have had them almost a full year and wear and wash them daily, I loved that they came in an assortment pack which is rare to find for women. Fits true to size if I could give 10 stars I would. Will always buy these assuming mine ever do wear out!",

A simple vista los colores se ven fabulosos, ya tenia un buen tiempo esperando este par (color verde y blanco con rayas). La tela se siente fresca y suave al tacto. Todavia no las lavo asi que no se si despues de la lavada seguiran estando bien los colores. Vale la pena decir que las compre porque me las recomendo una amiga, me dijo que muy buena calidad...ya veremos!",
