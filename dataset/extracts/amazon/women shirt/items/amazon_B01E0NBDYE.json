                "reviewText": "this review is for a woman's size XXL regular size woman's 16.I read the reviews carefully and ordered up a size. My weight is in my tummy.If you want a tighter fitting shirt, order down a size.If you do not like tight fitting clothing - order your normal size. If you like loser fitting clothing, order up a size.As you see from the photo, extra ease is already built into the polo. When you look at the seller's photo, you will see extra folds in the shirt. This shirt does not look fitted like in the photo. I read the reviews and they left me confused. The specific questions and answers helped me the best.The women's sizes and non women's sizes are not cut the same. If you are ordering a non women's size, pay attention to non women's size reviews. I ordered a green and black color. The Jerzees is just a plain polo with no decorations. This would be a good shirt for school or sports teams, groups, associations, or careers. It can be embroidered. It can be dressed up or down. I do not like taking chances when ordering online so I appreciate all the reviews.The woman's size length is little bit longer than average.The colors that I ordered are similar to the monitor colors but the green is darker in person than on my monitor.As you see in the photos, the black Jerzees 50/50 Polo looks true black in real life, but looks a bit faded next to the black pants.This Jerzees Jersey Polo can be ordered in woman's and Miss sizes which makes it great for team and work uniforms which may require logos. I plan to order more for a family reunion where the women are in all sizes.This Jerzees Polo shirt can be dressed up or down with jewelry and accessories which is especially useful when going from career to an evening function (like a sports game with the kids or parent teacher meeting) where you don't want to look like you just got off from work, but you don't have time to change. I plan to order more. The photos show the extra ease, length, and color of black next to another black. The hourglass shape shown in the seller's photo is because the shirt is pulled towards the back. Your figure would have to already be hourglass shaped and the shirt tight to get the shape shown in the seller's photo.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a royal purple polo to wear to work in the warmer months. I was hoping for a performance-type fabric (which this is not) and this was one that Amazon's search feature gave me. Since it was recently on sale, I decided to give it a try. I am satisfied with the fit, although it is a little large. I probably could have gotten a medium, but I was afraid of shrinkage, so I ordered a large to be on the safe side. Plus I don't like to wear things that are too form-fitting or revealing to work. It is not a straight polo shirt and does have some contouring/shaping built into it to account for a female figure. The fabric is a little stiff even after washing and is not as thick as some of my other polo shirts, but that may not be a bad thing in warmer weather. I do love the color though, so I will wear it for that reason alone. Hopefully it holds up well to repeated washing and drying.",

The color is deep and just right. I did order one size up. It was a tiny bit big at the shoulders, but the bust, waist, and length were just right by ordering one size up. It is not top quality, but for the price, it is very good quality.",

I have a steamer & soaked in downy, but so far only washed, it's really only made it maybe 25% better so I have alot of work to do with a steamer to wear. The fabric is stiff so it'll be hard. I only need it for work so it doesnt have to be perfect or even nice but my lord it's beyond worse than the picture, the buttons, collar, sleeves, nothing lays right. I knew it wouldn't be great but this was just pathetic. If you are hoping this will come nice, beautiful or even wearable without a lot of work to fix it then do not buy! Again if I just needed something like this I would so return it",
