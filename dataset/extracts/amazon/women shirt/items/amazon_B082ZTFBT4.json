                "reviewText": "What a pleasant surprise! The fabric is soft and lightweight without being see-through. It\u2019s jersey knit, much nicer than T-shirt fabric.The cut is slightly boxy but the fabric drapes so nicely that it isn\u2019t at all unflattering. I tried a partial tuck in front and it seemed to work without looking bunched up. The hem is slightly longer in back. The garment seems well constructedI am 5\u20195\u201d and 130ish pounds, 36C on top with slightly narrow shoulders. I have tummy bulges to hide, and this top did the trick. And for anyone with wider shoulders, this blouse will likely fit you very nicely.On me, the Medium seemed a little big in the shoulders at first. The first wash seemed to approve the fit. I washed on gentle cycle in barely warm water (I tested the temp by hand), tumbled out the wrinkles with NO HEAT, and then laid flat to dry. I got only a tiny amount of shrinkage, and it was to my benefit. (I had also tried on size Small and decided the fit might be slightly tight in the armholes after washing.)I know there are reviewers who claimed they got severe shrinkage in the wash. But I think they must have been using water that's too warm, possibly too much agitation (I used gentle cycle), or they put the blouse in the dryer. Even low heat is too much for rayon fabric.I would say the top looks dressy-ish because of how well the fabric drapes. But it\u2019s still casual enough and I think it will be cool and comfy this summer. I'll probably get another color.",

I usually don't like shirts that hang lower in the back than the front, but this one isn't too long and I like the look. It looks good tucked in, but I usually wear it untucked. Because the short sleeve is on the longer side, it was perfect for spring weather and I plan to wear it into the fall season. Right now, during these hot summer days, I'm enjoying its flowy and cool feel. I hang all my shirts and blouses up directly from the wash, but it looks like it would do well in the dryer and be wrinkle free.",

I will wash it first to see if it shrinks at all.Amazon- Nice blouse, consider adding a bit of black to the navy & white print, a thin line to outline the petals would be nice. The blouse could then easily be worn with black and well as navy. I would like to see more colors and prints in this style too.",
