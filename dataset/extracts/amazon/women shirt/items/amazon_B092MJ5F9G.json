It's not a light yellow but rather more of a winter white that blends beautifully with my camel colored coat and rust sweaters.I'm 5.2, 130, 38C and a medium fit perfectly.",

It\u2019s strong and thick but not too thick. Soft like modal but doesn\u2019t stretch out too much throughout the day. It also washes really well.The neckline is the perfect height, and the compression is perfect - like a hug but not uncomfortable. And although it is tighter, the shirt doesn\u2019t hug my torso or chest or sit weird like most tighter shirts too. I am someone who is very picky about clothing.This shirt marks all the boxes and I\u2019ve bought 3 so far and will be purchasing more \ud83d\ude0aI feel like I\u2019ve been searching for the perfect shirt forever and I found it here of all places!",

I have a smaller chest and it\u2019s a bit tight in the chest. So I suggest you size up in one size for a more comfortable fit.

                "reviewText": "I have several of these tops, both the long-sleeved and short-sleeved versions, and absolutely love them. I especially like the \"classic fit,\" which means that they fit true-to-size and not 'relaxed' or oversized. I also love the cotton-modal-spandex fabric. It's very soft, with just enough stretch to be comfortable, and doesn't wrinkle. It is breathable and surprisingly comfortable in both hot and cold weather. These tops wash and dry beautifully (warm water, gentle cycle, warm dryer, remove promptly and hang up, no ironing or fussing required.) And, best of all, the tops are very flattering and pretty. The longish length makes them best suited for tucking in, in my opinion. The sleeve length is about 3 inches too long for me, (I'm petite) so I machine hem them to fit me, no problem.",
