Buttonholes are also so large that they won't hold the neck closed. I'll need to stitch them smaller.The rest of the shirt runs small. I take a 1X in polos but got this in 3X due to the reviews and they were right. The drape is perfect now, not tight. Shoulders lay flat and don't pull. No bulges show at all. Arm holes are perfect. I just don't understand why the collar is so huge. For reference, I'm a 40D, broad shoulders and back, large waist, long arms.",
