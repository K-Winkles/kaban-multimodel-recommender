                "reviewText": "I wore this top with black pants to try it on for less than 10 mins and the band had left a mark on the polo and it stained the fabric! I tried washing it and it won\u2019t come off. I don\u2019t understand how this happened or how it got stained. I\u2019ve had those pants for a while and have been washed multiple times, I never had that issue happen before-updating my review to 0 because Amazon would not refund me for this. I returned the polo and it shows on my Amazon account that it was returned and that I supposedly received the refund on my Amazon account, when I log in it shows the balance 0. I tried to reach out to customer service couldn\u2019t reach a person and the robot would not understand what it means that the refund doesn\u2019t show up on my account. I spend so much money on this website. Not cool Amazon!",

                "reviewText": "I needed a white short sleeved shirt that was light and cooling for a horse show. I like my shirts tighter when riding so my clothing isn\u2019t flopping everywhere and I look more put together. I couldn\u2019t find any sizes that would fit me though. I came across this shirt and it looked like a great option\u2026boy was I right! As soon as I tried it on I knew that shirt was going to be my best friend during shows and daily rides. The fit is amazing and it is so comfortable. The shirt kept me so cool even though it was SUPER hot out. Also may I say the price was immaculate, 10000000% worth the money and I definitely recommend. If you are thinking about getting it, DO IT!",

                "reviewText": "I usually wear an X-Small to a small size in shirts but this shirt runs really small. For reference, I weigh 103 lbs., 32B chest, 24 waist. This shirt is skin tight on me. If I like my shirts really tight I would keep it, but not for me. I will be returning it. Also, the shirt is not very stretchy and the material is thick. I might try a larger size.",
