The material is extra soft and lived in.I got my usual size medium but I\u2019m thinking of trying a small. For around the house, it\u2019s perfect as is but if I wear it out, I\u2019ll have to wear a cami or bra due to the huge arm holes.",

                "reviewText": "This t shirt is perfect and quickly became a staple in my closet. I love the color but more importantly the material is super soft and lightweight and the design of the boxy fit makes it really breathable and flowy. I will note that the shirt could be considered slightly cropped yet still has enough length to fully cover the midriff - I find it the perfect length to tuck the front into high waisted shorts/pants without there being any excess fabric.",
