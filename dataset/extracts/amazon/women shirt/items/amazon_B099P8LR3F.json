                "reviewText": "I really like this shirt, which is of a nice heavier t-shirt weight - it feels substantial, not flimsy or fragile or see-through. The emerald green color is lovely, true to the photo and the X on the front is also in green thread, so it is visible, but not prominent. The shirt I received is smaller than I had anticipated. I sized up to the XL as I wanted a generous fit. The fit of the shirt is fine at the bust and hips (although certainly not oversized as I would have expected, given that I sized up from my usual L) and it only covers half my rear. I couldn\u2019t wear it with leggings, which was the intention. I DO like the shirt and will keep it to wear with jeans this fall/winter. The color is spectacular, but I wish that the shirt had the oversized look I was intending when I ordered. The good news is that the neck fits great (I see that other reviewers have had issues with the neck being too wide/loose).",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s always tough to buy a product for the first time, you don\u2019t know the quality, the fit, the styling, and the comfort. This particular top looked like it might be a nice one. I gave it a shot and ordered one. The top arrived quickly and it was packaged really well. The first thing that I noticed was how soft it was. The fabric is so soft, I knew it would be one of those instant favorites\u2014and I was right. I wore it out a couple days later and people noticed that it looked comfortable. It\u2019s soft, it looks really nice, it\u2019s comfortable, and it is constructed very well. The stitching is not cheaply done, you can see they have done quality work. The only negative I have is that it runs a little small. For example, if you like your sweater like tops to be roomy, order two sizes larger. If you\u2019re a 12 or a 16. When I purchase for the first time, especially for this type of clothing, I order the next size up. But the 14 was even a bit snug, I\u2019m going to be ordering another one, but this time I am going to order a 16 to see how it goes.",
