Even in the large, it's tight, not too tight, but no extra room. I like it, but I want to return it because of the annoying tag. Why would they sew a white tag into the seam of a black mesh shirt? You can see it from a mile away. There is no way to remove it without ruining the shirt. Even if I cut it, I will still be able to see the white part left over. There is also a smaller tag at the back of the neck that is less noticeable, but that would still bother me too. I have bought other mesh shirts with removable tags, why didn't they use those? I guess if you are planning to keep it tucked in and your hair will cover the neck tag, it will be fine.",
