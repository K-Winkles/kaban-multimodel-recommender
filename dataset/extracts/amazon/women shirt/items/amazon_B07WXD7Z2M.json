Back in the day a single one cost $35-$40.If you care about this, these were created after Gildan bought them out, but by all appearances seem to be the same material, style and build quality. I swear these shirts never wear. They\u2019re a slimmer fit around torso and have appropriate-length sleeves for the vast majority of people (\u201cshows just enough bicep\u201d is what I remember someone telling me). Wearing these oversized would be a mistake, but, for an everyday fit, these t-shirts are a classic.",

                "reviewText": "I have never written a review before. But someone at American Apparel should know that their Fine Jersey Crewneck, their claim to fame, is not the same shirt it was when I first became a loyal customer. Not the same shirt, at all.First of all, they have added side seams to the design. I loved these shirts when they had no side seam. This change would not be such a big deal, but the quality of this new shirt is so low, there are threads hanging out all over the seams. Am I supposed to sit down and trim all these threads? No thanks. I'll just send it back.The other reason why I have to send this back is the fit. I am just over 6 ft, and the hem of the Medium is roughly halfway down my thighs. It looks more like a dress. I just need a t-shirt.I hope American Apparel will go back to making t-shirts the way they did 5 or 10 years ago! Or can someone please refer me to another Made-in-USA brand who makes t-shirts like that?",

                "reviewText": "I ordered 2 of these for samples of whether to use them in a t-shirt printing side hustle. Look, I know t-shirts. In general and specific brands. I've been wearing them and paying close attention to shirts my entire life. I know what is good and bad about all brands. My wife/SO doesn't (and never has) buy my clothes and I am very picky about what I wear. I write all that to let the consumer know I have some knowledge about this and competing products. Whether you'll buy that and trust this review is up to you.Specifically on this shirt. It gets a lot of good reviews in general, especially from those in the t-shirt printing business. And, compared to recent runs of shirts by makers like Gildan, this IS a superior product. However, while Gildan was once a good product, it is now terrible. Sizing is way off and the quality of the shirt is terrible. Saying this shirt is better is no endorsement. It falls short of the Hanes Beefy-T shirt (also not what it once was) and WAY short of the Comfort Colors line, though CC shirts have issues with longevity.I can't speak to longevity of this shirt as I've only washed and worn it once, but the fit is tight and the material is way thinner than it should be. Hold even a dark shirt (mine is navy) up TOWARDS any light source and you can see right through it. That is NOT a good thing with this product. In fairness as far as fit, I'd fill out most any shirt in my size, but the Comfort Colors line is not as tight. I will say that this shirt has better than average length which is a good thing. I absolutely hate t-shirts that start out short enough and end up being \"belly\" shirts (like we used to wear in football) after only a few washings. I don't think you'll have a problem with that.Should you buy this to wear if you just want a t-shirt? NO. Go find some Comfort Colors shirts. Far better selection of colors and even prices across the line. Are you looking for shirts for your printing business? I'd only consider these for your lower end shirts, which may not be a good thing as they're probably not priced sufficiently for low end shirts. However, you may not have a choice as what is actually on the low end (like Gildan) are no longer wearable. If you sell your product on those shirts, you WILL regret it. I wouldn't go so far as to say that with this shirt, but lets just say I won't be using this brand for my products.",
