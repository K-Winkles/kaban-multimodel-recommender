They wash very nicely and warm water. And with delicate cycle dryer I have not noticed any shrinking. Used to buy these at Walmart but they don't have them there anymore. I would buy several every summer and considered them disposable after a year because they are so nicely priced but they actually have lasted much longer than just a season! So glad I found these here on amazon!",

I still have a few JMS tshirts from a decade or more ago that I hang onto because they were so great, but they're starting to fall apart from use, and the new shirts are NOTHING like them. Cheap quality, poor fit, and if you go over size 2X or so, they suddenly explode in length and become like nightgowns - why?! I'm not going to bother trying with JMS shirts anymore.",

                "reviewText": "The shirts are super cute, knocked a star off just because the white is totally see through, and they do run really small. I'm normally between a 1x-2x.. But for these tops.. I got a 3x and it fits just right, I don't like things tight on me for my main problem area is in my tummy\ud83d\ude02 But I liked the 1 that fit me so much I ordered 7 MORE! They are light weight and perfect for spring/summer.. And for $4.55 how can you go wrong?! I like the fact that there are sizes that do fit bigger girls and your not insecure about wearing 1 of these super cute tops.. Once the rest of these tops become available for purchase ..I'll purchase the rest of these JMS tops. You won't be disappointed!!! Just order a size or 2 up and you'll be happy with your purchase like me\ud83d\ude0a Also to make the shirts/clothes last.. Wash in cold water, gentle cycle and HANG DRY!!! That's the key in saving your clothes from shrinking!!!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc55Update: After receiving most of my order, I wanted to wear the pink Drangonflies for Easter.. For some reason just that top runs smaller in the 3X? and the glitter or whatever is on the dragonflies.. I couldn't WAIT to take the shirt off after just a few hours wear.. It's SO itchy, stiff and all in all.. Very uncomfortable! Very disappointed in this 1 because I really loved the look of it.. I feel like this 1 will totally shrink after wash! Which now made me try on everyone that I bought.. All the other's are comfortable, soft and roomy! Maybe a 4X in the Dragonflies would be good.. But to size up AGAIN.. Not worth the hassle in returning! But like I said.. I purchased pretty much everyone that was available.. Total of 8! Yes 8!!! And everyone was really nice, comfy and not snug fitting nor stiff!.. I did though had to size up to a 3X. I'm normally between a 1-2X.. The Paris 1 I bought in a 2X and could barley get my arms in over my head.. Gave to my daughter and she's a L-XL and it fits her as if it was a size Large?! So please consider sizing up 1-2 bigger than your normal size! Hope this helps! Happy Shopping \ud83d\udecd\ud83d\udce6",

The shirt itself is really pretty and so far the graphics seem to be holding up well. I first bought the black LOVE one...in 4x...my normal size. It's sooo small...I was so disappointed. Fits more like 3x....maybe even 2x. It doesn't cover my belly totally either which I dont like. After reading reviews...I sized up...even though I didnt want to! lol So, I ordered the 5x. I like my shirts loose...NOT tight fitting at all. Even the 5x is a little snug around the belly. Everywhere else it's good though. I will probably never wear this shirt without something over it because it hugs too much where I dont want it to...BUT....I wanted to add a little color into my wardrobe...and these are good for that. I wear them with jean capris and a thin black cardigan over it...with some sandals and it's super cute. I have the teal w/gold writing, the black w/pink writing and purple w/butterflies. they were really cheap so I took a chance! I didn't realize the purple one was shiny...it's really pretty! The black one, I just received...the pink writing is a fuzzy graphic which is a little weird...so hopefully I like it...not sure yet. The teal has a gold foil and is also really pretty. They're a little thin...but seem to be sewn well...I'm hoping they hold up. For the price...it's worth buying. Where can you get a shirt for $8 these days? lol So....I would say, try it...but definitely size up if you dont like them tight!",

                "reviewText": "JMS romantically impressionistic graphic tees for Plus-Sized women are a favorite wardrobe choice for me.Especially when the fabric content is not overdone with too much modal. In recent years JMS has reduced the cotton in their tees and sized them way down to the point where there is not much luck with the fitting of women with very large breasts. Due to my injury and connective tissue disease, I am not able to wear bras for support purposes. this makes it crucial for me to find tees that are not tight across my chest ( when the rest of me is not as large.) I used to be able to wear a much smaller size of these tees until they changed the sizing.The fabric on this tee is soft and it fits across my chest. I always try to wash in cold and air dry my clothing to preserve the length of its life and to prevent the predominant shrinkage that happens with ever more frequency as fast-fashion continues to dominate the world. I admired this tee for a long time and I will now purchase several more to save to wear as this is a discontinued design.I suggest that you always turn your clothing inside out, put it into a fine mesh washing bag or a pillowcase closed with an elastic hair tie, wash in cold, and always drip it dry on your clothes line or your shower rod.Have fund with finding your best JMS tees.",
