Price-point is well below \u201cin-store retail\u201d and Amazon quality is excellent. This is the nicest henley I own and have now bought it in blk/Wht stripe, too. My drawers are overflowing w/basics fr Amazon Essentials!! This washes well and looks and behaves more expensive than it is. My other ribbed cotton/blends have been from Target!! My 24yo daughter loves their ribbed tees, too. I normally dress in an \u201cup-scale casual-style.\u201d I wear GOLD Tory Burch jewelry(mixed w/real gold and some Nordy gold pieces, too)TB belts, Tory, MZ Wallace or Gucci shoulder bags(have u seen the NEW MZ WALLACE CROSBY SLING in BLACK LACQUER??), Ugg slip-on sneakers(or Ugg shearling lined boots), WOOL Sneakers(have you seen and FELT these??SO comfy and well made), In the summer I wear Gold metallic Birkenstocks (or silver, gunmetal, patent black & others) in the summer\u2026 I shop at the \u201cMother-Ship\u201d Nordstrom & the Rack. I supplement my wardrobe w/items from Target and Amazon Essentials. Pair it all with either expensive jeans that fit(once I know my size, I shop discount like Poshmark or resale!), cashmere pants, well designed pocketed pull-on Linens(Target!!) and the like. None of it looks \u201ccheap.\u201d My University degree is in Fashion Merch so I humbly am relaying that I KNOW good merch and the value of quality and natural fibers. This long sleeved tee looks and feels quality and I\u2019m very pleased with all aspects of this purchase. I ordered a SMALL- I am 5\u20194\u201d approx 120lbs (118lbs today)and I\u2019m large chested(34DDD). Even though a size SMALL, this tee does not look OR feel tight due to the fabric blend and ribbing. I am smaller boned and slim but the tee has bits of forgiveness due to the fabric blend and ribbing. The ribbing is fine so it\u2019s not loud or an obvious rib. I trust it will out-last me. What more could I ask for? Happy shopping!",
