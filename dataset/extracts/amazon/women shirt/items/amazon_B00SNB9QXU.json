In this case, I needed a polo shirt for my job. I had found one when I was thrifting, but I wanted a backup one for if something happened to the first, or it was in the wash when I needed it. I bought this in the size \"large\" and it is a little bit large on me, but I am still figuring out whether to go for a tight medium or a loose large because I am right in between. I don't look amazing in it, but I do not look horrible. The shirt did the job that I bought it for, but I have not gotten my money's worth out of it yet because I have only worn it twice. It is doing its job by giving me the feeling of comfort knowing I do not have to worry about the \"What Ifs\" though.The shirt was on the thinner side, but not see-through. So this is good if one would need it to be used on a hot day. It is very long, which works great for someone that is tall, like me.",

                "reviewText": "It definitely seems well made. The collar is slightly \"reinforced\" with a cloth band at the bottom so it keeps it's shape. The shirt is very soft, not too long (I'm 5'2 so that's definitely a factor), but slightly big in the arms (a bit longer and wider). However you probably want to size up. The 2X was perfect for me. A 1X would have fit but been too form fitting in the chest for me.Overall, if you're a bigger lady, especially if it's in the chest, size up one. If you're a smaller cup size, you're probably okay with ordering your normal size.As white shirts go; unless they're a really thick cotton, they're all going to be a bit see though. That being said, this one isn't bad. A pale yellow bra for example won't show through at all.I'm using this as a work shirt for a coffee shop so I'll update in a few months about how it's held up.",

                "reviewText": "The fabric of the shirt is soft and the shirt is well made.I don't know how it fits however, because I can't get it over my shoulders. Going by the size chart and the reviews that recommend sizing up, I did just that. I ordered an x-large (42-44 inch chest) to give my 40 inch chest just a bit more room.Unfortunately, the shirt I received looked too small when I opened the packaging. I tried to put it on and I couldn't get it below my armpits. I took it off, checked the size printed inside the shirt (xl) and then dug out my seamstress tape. From side seam to side seam the body of the shirt measures 18.5 inches... that's 37 inches a whopping 5 inches smaller than what's shown on the sizing chart for an XL shirt.This polo shirt is very nice. The color is vibrant and lovely, I just wish I could actually wear it.It upsets me when sizing charts are not representative of the actual items of clothing.This is my major complaint with online clothes shopping. I HATE needing to buy clothing up to two sizes bigger, just in hopes of recieving something that *might* fit. No. I don't guesstimate. I measure myself in the bra or undergarments I will be wearing with a particular piece of clothing, because if I can't try something on, I need to go by exact measurements.Now I get to return 3 shirts and decide if I want to play \"size lotto\". i.e. if an XL is really 37\" does that mean I need a 3XL to find a 42\" shirt. It's a pain in the a** to have to ferret out fit.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this product on August 11th, 2018, and it arrived today, Sept 10th, literally an hour ago.It arrived in a standard plastic envelope. When I opened this shirt, I knew STRAIGHT away that this \"3 x\" was NOT in fact, 3 x. At least, Hanes idea of a 3x is for someone a lot thinner, and less chest-endowed. I laid this shirt down beside my Croft & Barrows 3 x as well as my Rider's Lee 2 x <-- Two. X. and noticed that the Hanes was at least TWO SIZES SMALLER than the 2 x and the 3!On top of that, I could barely get it over my darn head, let alone my chest. And when I did I noticed that there was a hole in the shirt already!!This is the second item I have ordered from Hanes that is way too small despite using sizes I *KNOW* fit me and I am just plain disappointed. I now have a shirt that is basically going to have to become bathroom cleaning rags. I would not recommend hanes for any plus sized woman or anyone really. I don't have the money to be wasting it like this and won't be buying this brand again. :(",

It fits perfect and is incredibly soft. I actually bought it for a Halloween costume and just bought the cheapest white polo I could find because I thought I would just wear it once but I absolutely love it! So soft and actually quite cute. Not my style but I\u2019m totally going to make it my style because I like it that much! Praying it doesn\u2019t shrink in the wash because it fits perfect like this. Even if it does though it does have a big of stretch to it so it will still be nice. Again, if you wear a smaller size (I\u2019m usually a 2 or 4) BUY TRUE TO SIZE! And buy this cause it\u2019s cute hahaha",

                "reviewText": "I said \"fit as expected\" BUT I ordered XL instead of my usual L, based on reviews that said this shirt ran small. It does so by ordering an XL, I got the correct size for me. It was ever so slightly large, but after going in the dryer, the fit was just right. I also like that it's a normal cut and not the form-fitting-for-a-pencil cut. It's hard to find shirts for real people nowadays. I also love that it is a lightweight T-shirt material because I live in Hawaii and heavier fabrics aren't for me. Just for reference if you're thinking of buying this shirt- I am 5' tall, 140 lbs, 40C and I have skinny shoulders and a \"spare tire\" (thanks to my medications) and I wear size 14 petite jeans. I will be ordering more.",
