                "reviewText": "I recently snagged the Verdusa Women's Casual Tie Back Dolman Sleeve Blouse, and it's safe to say it's earned a prime spot in my rotation. Here's a quick breakdown of why I'm loving it:1. **Sleeve Design**: The dolman sleeves are a refreshing touch. They provide ample room, making the blouse incredibly comfortable. Plus, they give it a modern, relaxed vibe that's different from the standard sleeve styles out there.2. **Mock Neck**: The mock neck adds a touch of sophistication. It's not too high, so it's comfortable, but it definitely elevates the overall look of the blouse.3. **Tie Back Detail**: This is probably my favorite feature. The tie back not only adds a cute detail to the blouse but also allows for a bit of adjustability in the fit. It's both functional and stylish!4. **Fit and Feel**: The blouse drapes nicely and feels soft against the skin. It's lightweight, making it perfect for layering or wearing on its own.5. **Versatility**: Whether it's a day at the office or a casual outing, this blouse fits in seamlessly. I've paired it with slacks, skirts, and jeans, and it looks great with all of them.All in all, the Verdusa Tie Back Dolman Sleeve Blouse is a winner in my book. It's a blend of comfort, style, and versatility, making it a must-have for any wardrobe. Solid 5 stars from me! \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50",

All the wrinkles came out. The material in the royal blue is not too thin. No need to wear a tank underneath. I included pics before and after. I feel like it swallows me whole though so don\u2019t go up a size. I got a small. I think this would look better on a larger person than myself. The color is beautiful. It\u2019s shorter than I thought it would be but I can definitely tuck it in. It looks best just tucked in the front. The arms aren\u2019t as dramatic as the picture looks but they are bat winged. It\u2019s kinda potato sack like on my frame. I\u2019m 5\u20194 36/26/36 frame. 120 lbs.",

I am 5\u201d7, 150 pounds 38D and curves in all the right places. I ordered a medium.

I was excited to wear this shirt to an event I have coming up this weekend and unfortunately I will not be wearing it. The fit is not flattering at all. The shirt fits like a square box. Or I should say, looks like I'm wearing a square box. Super unflattering and I'm not usually picky. If it's comfortable, I'll more than likely wear it. Well, this is comfortable, but I will not be wearing it. Also, it came smelling pleasant, however not pleasant as in never worn before, pleasant as in that it smells like someone else's perfume. Most of the smell is around the neckline. So either someone tried it on and sent it back or wore it and sent it back, but definitely was worn by someone else. Not impressed with this purchase at all.",
