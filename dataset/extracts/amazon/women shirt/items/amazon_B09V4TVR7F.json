This is actually my second tank top from this line. I have many GAP/Old Navy undershirts and this is the better kind. No dramatic scoops, doesn't keep trying to be a tube top by ejecting off my shoulders, and is long enough to tuck into a pair of shorts.I'd happily buy a third. These are nice tops!",

It is indeed all-cotton, but the fabric is not ribbed, which I prefer in a tank top. It doesn't seem worth returning just one tank, so I won't bother. But I definitely won't buy more of this item due to the misleading description.",
