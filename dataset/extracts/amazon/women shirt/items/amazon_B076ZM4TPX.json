                "reviewText": "Overall, the shirt met some my expectations. It was tapered at the sides like I wanted. Most of the button up ones I have ordered are not, though they are pictured as tapered. I love the color. I expect it may wrinkle more than expected. My biggest disappointment is that it is tight across the bust, and I cannot wear it buttoned up. I\u2019m small to average in the bust, but it\u2019s still too tight. It\u2019s also too tight in across the shoulders. It was advertised as \u201ctrue to size\u201d\u201d. If you order it, I recommend ordering a size up.",

                "reviewText": "DO NOT BUY THIS SHIRT!1. It took forever to get it.2. When I ordered this, it said free shipping and returns. BUT THEY WON'T PAY FOR THE RETURN!!!3. The shirt has a lopsided cut in the sleeve areas. It's like one arm hole is much larger than the other one.When I tried the shirt on, the left sleeve (in the back) fit the way it was supposed to. However, the right sleeve, where it is sewn into the shirt, came down several inches further along the side (bigger arm hole) of the shirt. There was a big bulge of fabric under and around the back of my arm. Then there was this bunched up fabric from the upper middle of my back towards where the sleeve was sewn into the shirt.It really upsets me that I have to pay to return an inferior product! I don't know what country they made this shirt in, but it's another product made overseas that's poorly made, weird shape, and poor sizing.12/07/20 UPDATE: I SENT THIS SHIRT BACK TODAY AND IT COST ME $5.65 TO RETURN. REMEMBER, IF YOU BUY THIS FROM THIS COMPANY AND NEED TO SEND IT BACK, IT WILL COST YOU OVER $5.00.12/16/20 UPDATE # 2: I didn't get a refund, so I had to contact VEE TREND the seller of this Port Authority shirt to get my money back. I had to send them the information from the return label to prove I mailed the shirt back. Then they finally refunded my money, but they SHORT CHANGED ME as the refund was $5.50 less than I paid for the shirt.Also, I cut and pasted the following from the return information.Instructions from VeeTrends:Please inspect the item upon receiving . In case of any damage, please contact us immediately so we can correct the problem. We offer free returns (with no restocking fee) within 30 days of purchase.VEE TREND IS A HORRIBLE COMPANY TO DEAL WITH. WATCH FOR THEIR NAME AND NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM. There is NO free returns as stated in their return instructions.",
