I\u2019ve washed and dried it many times and the colors have stayed nice. The width Is very good if you have a bit of a tummy that you want to hide but still fits nice around the back without being too baggy. It\u2019s the perfect length to wear with yoga pants. Not too long but just right to cover your crotch area and most of your butt if you want to be dressed modestly in public.",

The only con is color selection. Navy blue, black, and Royal would be a great edition. I\u2019d buy all three.The material feels soft. The stitching is similar to the original I own from another brand. Though I like this material for it\u2019s thicker feel. The other shirt\u2019s lasted six years. Since my first purchase is white I\u2019d be happy to get a couple of seasons use.The purple that\u2019s on the way expect longer as white is more difficult to maintain the new vibe with wearing and laundry. I\u2019ll repurchase as needed if this shirt is still for sale.Another thing that\u2019s great, it\u2019s not form fitting. And, not too loose. Just right. Flattering on my slender physique. It also lands below the belt at pocket height. I\u2019m 5\u2019 91/2\u201d so if you\u2019re shorter expect this shirt to sit low to the tush in a flattering way.\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaf",
