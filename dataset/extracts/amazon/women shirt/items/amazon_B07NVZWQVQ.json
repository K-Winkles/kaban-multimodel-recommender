Sometimes a shirt with a collar is required so I\u2019ve been searching for cotton clothes to play sports in (any designers out there?! ) I ordered this shirt in several colors and ended up keeping one, basically \u201csettling\u201d, but not loving. I\u2019m a size medium top (5\u20192\u201d 145 lbs). This top is a couple inches too long (and I\u2019m not about to tuck it in with my grandma waistline) so there\u2019s a bit of awkward extra at the hemline. But it\u2019ll suffice. It\u2019s a fairly heavy weight polo so will work in moderate temps, but will be too hot for me above 70-75 degrees. *This review is obviously for a narrow set of circumstances from a person who has sensory issues so don\u2019t take it too seriously unless you are like me \ud83d\ude02",
