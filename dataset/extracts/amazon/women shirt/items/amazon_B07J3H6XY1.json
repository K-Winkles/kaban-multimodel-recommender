                "reviewText": "I do not think this shirt is perfect, but I gave it 5 stars because it's comfortable, easy to care for, practical, professional, decent quality, and modest. I like that it has a collar that can be buttoned up to the neck, that it has long sleeves, and that it's not cropped in length. It's very difficult to find a blouse that meets those criteria at $20ish dollar price point.It is rather sheer; I hope that my photos illustrate that my undershirt and skirt are visible through it. That's acceptable to me because I always wear multiple layers (including a blazer or sweater at work to better resolve the problem).My main issue is that it definitely runs large. I bought a small, which is my usual size, originally, and it was hopeless. Even the extra-small is very loose and long on me. For how I intend to wear it, between other layers, that's fine. But it would not be acceptable for my work's dress code, for example, if I didn't wear something on top because of the billows from the loose fit combined with the buttons pulling is straight towards the center.That said, given the modesty it allows and how easy it is to care for and wear, I'm still very pleased and grateful that such an option is readily available on Amazon. I would recommened this!",

                "reviewText": "The thickness is a little thin for winter ware, but perfect for summer or winter if you have another shirt to ware underneath. .The fit for me was a little tight, but I gave it to my friend who is also a 2x, it fit her a little snug but still nice. She is tall and has long arms, the length for her was perfect I'm 5'4, I'm short and length of the arms were a little long, but is fine.I think it will look great after it's been worn a few hours.I ordered the blue pin stripped shirt the blue was a soft a blue, it looked beautiful.My only concern is will it wrinkle?On the fit, I have large arms, and it fit!It looks great hanging up, It is a good buy. I think it's going to come out looking nice after being tossed in the dryer.I will update after my friend wears it for Thanksgiving. Yes it's nice as a casual and can be worn dresses for lll",
