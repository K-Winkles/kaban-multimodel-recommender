                "reviewText": "I\u2019m rarely disappointed with my Amazon purchases, but this here is a resounding NO. Color lighter than indicated in picture. I thought it would be a darker army green as pictured, but it\u2019s rather a light sage color. I bought it to go with a fedora hat I bought off Amazon, but the color didn\u2019t live up to the hype. Very stiff material with no movement unlike what\u2019s shown in picture. The picture looks as though it would move as you walk. Nope! Just stiff and boring. Definitely a miss, so I\u2019m returning. Size is accurate nonetheless. I\u2019m 5\u20196\u201d around 220 and I bought a XL.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a knee-length tunic beach cover up (that actually covers, not something that looks like stripper wear!), and I was pleasantly surprised with how well-made this oversized shirt is, and the high quality of the 70/30 cotton/linen fabric is (I've been sewing since I was in jr. high, so I have pretty high standards for construction/fabric). I bought a pink XL 'cause I want it to be very loose, and I would say it's true to size, or even slightly oversized. HOWEVER, I may decide to return this soon, as I was hoping for something more loosely woven, more like a gauze fabric (not the fault of the garment/manufacturer!). Again, this is very well made and the fabric is high quality. I might check to see if this vendor sells loose shirts that are shorter, as I could use 2-3 summer blouses from this same fabric.",
