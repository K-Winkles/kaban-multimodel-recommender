I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d and about 130 lbs. I ordered the small - what I wear in short sleeve tops.sizing wise I wear my clothes not tight, for a tighter fit in the body I would size down. They are a perfect length for me and the arm length is spot on (nothing worse than a long sleeve feeling more like a 3/4). And the fabric? Not cheap and thin. It has some weight to it, which is a huge bonus for upper Midwest in winter, but not so heavy that it will be uncomfortable under an cardi or flannel. Also very soft which is amazing for my sensitive skin.I highly recommend! I will be buying in more colors!!",

It\u2019s roomy enough to be tucked in the front/side and still hang nicely. I was afraid it might be too large based in some reviews but it fits perfectly. It fits right on the shoulders and arm lengths. It just meant to be a nice roomy style but, as for that, it\u2019s not THAT roomy.
