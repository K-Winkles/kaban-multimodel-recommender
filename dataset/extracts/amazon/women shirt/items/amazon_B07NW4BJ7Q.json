                "reviewText": "Quality polo with thick, quality fabric. Runs a tad small which is common for a polo. If you want it fitted then stick with your size. If you want it comfortable then I would size up. I ordered Medium and it fits fine. It is form fitting. I should have sized up for comfort so that's my bad, I know better. Sleeves have that cuffed tighter fit but not so fitted it gives arm muffin top. Good length, not short not too long. Does not have that boxy unisex look, definitely tailored for women. I will order again.",

The shirt is 96% cotton/4% spandex, but it is pretty stretchy, so I'm hoping it will fit better after washing. Luckily, it's not super long and has little side splits, so it hits the hips in a good spot. True to the picture, the color was a darker shade of red, so you won't look like a fire engine coming down the street.",
