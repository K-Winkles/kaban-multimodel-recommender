                "reviewText": "I ordered the burgundy to wear with winter white slacks for a winter-themed bridal shower. The color was gorgeous and I received a ton of compliments. It fits great and is true to size. I'm 6 feet tall and have long arms and wide hips and the x-large fit great! Plenty of length in the arms and body and not tight around the hips. The long cuffs and pearl buttons really dress it up. I live in Florida and it was a warm day but it was super comfortable. I like it so much I'll be ordering a couple more in other colors/prints",

I\u2019m 4\u201911\u201d 36c 120lbs and fortunately it\u2019s not too long in the sleeves. I plan to wash gently cold and hang to dry for many wears because it\u2019s such a unique top, it\u2019s become my favorite for casual social events. I received complements on the Pearl details the first night out. Definitely recommend and am considering another color but the magenta/fuchsia is beautiful. Fabric is soft and feels nice with a some knit cotton stretch to it. I think this top anyone would love.",

I don't know what it would look like in the other fabrics, but I wish they had more choices, as I look terrible in the other colors offered. I might buy a second one in the black, I like it so much. My husband is going to love it.The sleeves are just the right length for me, and although I am pretty short, my arms are long for my height. The cuffs are so soft -- I was able to just slide my hands through easily, without unbuttoning the cuffs. They have a small amount of stretch to them. The neckline is just beautiful and very flattering. Why don't companies make more necklines like this one??? So feminine, and doesn't accentuate a round, mature face! Lol. For reference, I am 5'3\", and weigh 140 pounds. I usually wear a size 8 or 10 in a top, or a medium. The medium is a perfect fit for me.",
