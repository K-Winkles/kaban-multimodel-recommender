I gave it to a friend who fell in love with this shirt as well, and another friend wanted one so I ended up ordering even more. It\u2019s a great shirt! It\u2019s well worth the money.

The sleeves are so cute and it\u2019s just a great shirt! My only criticism is that it is long. Like if you tuck in jeans, you have to smooth it out bc of how long it is. Still, Will buy in more colors!",

I was expecting a regular fitting t-shirt with cute sleeves and this is not that at all. Not the fit I was looking for so I'm going to try it in an XXL because otherwise the shirt is actually pretty cute.",
