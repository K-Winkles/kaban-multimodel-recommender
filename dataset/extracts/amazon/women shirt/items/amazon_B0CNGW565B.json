I may decide to resew this, but I think the shirt is fine as is, for wearing about the house. It is for casual wear and would not be the type of shirt to wear to work unless your business place is very casual. I sized up and am very glad I did so. It says fitted shirt, so unless you want the fabric to cling to you, better size up. Other than the problem with the cuffs, the shirt is well-made and very comfortable. Keep in mind you will want this for casual wear and you will be happy.",

I have worn and washed it a few times, and it washes well without shrinkage or wrinkles. It is nice to wear on cooler days when a sweater is too much.

                "reviewText": "I should've read reviews before purchasing. Exactly what others are saying. There's weird stitching around the cuffs of the shirt. I got the blue and orange color and the orange on the sleeves is a noticeable difference to the orange on the body of the shirt. I liked how the shirt looked on the model, I love the slouchy oversized look. But I didn't love the shirt on me when I tried it on.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this shirt because I liked the look of it. When the shirt arrived it was exactly what I expected with the exception of the elastic sleeves. I at first thought the shirt was inside out when I went to wash it, but saw that it was the style of the shirt. It washed well and and I put it on to wear. The sleeves having a cling factor is great to pull up and keep the sleeve pulled up on my arm. The elastic part unfortunately irritated my skin (which it may have latex in it). I did like the style but hate that the sleeves prevent me from wearing it.",
