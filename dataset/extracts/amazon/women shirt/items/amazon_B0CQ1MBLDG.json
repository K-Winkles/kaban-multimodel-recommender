They will definitely keep you warm in cooler months and may be too hot for warmer months. I have a 28\" waist and bought a size M. It fits perfectly, but is fitted so if you want breathing room, go up a size. Highly recommend and would buy other shades.",

I had ordered a small as I did want a more tailored fit. However, this fits more like a compression shirt. The small was too tight in the arm pit area. So I ordered a medium which was better. The sleeve length is good as my arms are a bit long. However, it is a bit shorter waisted than I prefer. It r the ends to ride up under other shirts/sweaters. Admittedly I am long waisted. But if I tuck it into my jeans, it stays put.This is good for cooler weather as it\u2019s thicker than your average t shirt.",

The he elasticity is strong in them. They have a nice appearance with a stripe type look to them. However I do feel like they are a little bit on the heavier side. They are pretty warm and better for cold winter days.",

Also a good length, I always have trouble finding shirts that aren\u2019t cropped. So these are good 10/10 recommend",
