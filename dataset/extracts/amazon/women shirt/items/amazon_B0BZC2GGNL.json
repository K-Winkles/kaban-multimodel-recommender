                "reviewText": "I own two of these. One in champagne and one in black. I bought them based on the size chart provided by the seller and they fit as expected and described. If you want the baggy look as seen in the seller photos you may want to size up. (I did not and the fit was perfect for a classic style vs. modern oversized.)The fabric is just lovely. It looks and feels like silk or a high end satin. And I am a picky, picky buyer. The fit, is not that flattering as a piece worn by itself however \u2014 at least for me. It\u2019s boxy. But I am planning it to be used as a layering piece, so this works fine for me.I wanted to note about the boxy fit. Some other reviewers noting the boxy fit were suggesting princess seams or were noting the type of horizontal seams used on these beautiful quality, classic layering pieces.If princess seams are used, they would destroy they clean/simple design intended. It would make the classic cut of these look matronly with seams going down the entire front of the shirt.The horizontal seaming under the arms but around the bust is intended to provide a bit more of a tailored fit. Again, this is how this type of garment is to be assembled.I would agree that maybe a bit more of a curved cut on the side seams itself would be helpful to minimize the boxy feel so it could be worn by itself. But this style is intended to be a boxy cut and layered the tucked/blouses if worn in the \u201cclassic\u201d fashion. If worn in the 1980s reboot that seems to be \u201cmodern\u201d fashion these days and worn by itself this is supposed to be boxy\u2014 worn with tailored pants, tucked and bloused slightly.So to me, this cut is fine. It\u2019s more about buyers knowing how to style it based on their body type and fashion choices.A beautiful tailored blazer layered over this when it has been tucked in is lovely.A pair of tailored pants with this bought oversized but bloused and tucked is also stunning.This can be dressed up or down. Made modern or classic.All in all this is a staple item that every woman should have in her closet in basic colors as these can be styled in many ways for years to come. For the price point, these are beautiful and look far more expensive than they are. I plan to buy another in light grey.A note on the champagne color \u2014 it\u2019s a nude pink with a hint of warm undertones. I would call it blush. It\u2019s not a true pink, however it has more pink than warm undertones. It is not a beige, apricot or a peach shade. A truly beautiful color that is on trend.",

I\u2019m 5\u20192\u201d , 105# . This top would probably fit most women properly. I chose to return rather paying to have the top altered.",
