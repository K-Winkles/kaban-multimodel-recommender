I wear a large and ordered a large and it fits very nicely without being too tight or clingy.I really like the material. It is fairly stretchy, a little on the thicker side, but oh so soft on the skin! It seems well made and with good material. Color is the same as it is on the model. Buttons are sewn on well. Did not find any loose threads or bad stitching. Seems to be on the dressy/nicer side of polo shirts. Has a few wrinkles from being rolled up and shipped, but I'm sure they will come out with ease. Happy with this find.",

Because there is some stretch, a small would have fit, but I like the little extra length of the medium (I'm slim but not short...) and it still fits okay in the shoulders. I find this happens fairly often for me. I like the red dahlia color, but I couldn't get a good picture of it. \ud83d\ude1c I knew this when I ordered it, but this is yet another shirt that can't go in the dryer, so just be aware of that. This is nice. I wouldn't mind having it in a couple of other colors.",

The material does feel a bit too 'polyester' for my preference and I would prefer if it had a more cottony feel, but it's still comfortable so I wouldn't consider this a major issue. The fit is perfect for a medium. Loose but also slim and flattering. The shirt seems well made and the color is a beautiful warm rustic red that looks just like the photo. I really like this shirt!",

I checked the exact measurements and sizes chart (DOKOTOO size chart, NOT the Size guide - US T shirt) before ordering. I measure 36B, 28, 37. The fabric is ribbed and stretchy with a structured collar, making it slightly dressy. I am not a big fan of short sleeves on me but these are a good, longer length short sleeve. I also like the longer length of this top and the fact it is not cropped or shortened. This arrived with a few wrinkles that easily steamed out with my hand steamer. Comfy.",

The Small size fits my petite athletic daughter who wears an adult size 0-2 in a fitted way. Not really body-hugging but its viscose-elastane fabric tends to be stretchy & cling despite its somewhat thick material. This fabric needs specific laundry care too (cool water & hang-/line-dry) since its fabric will shrink. My laundering tendency will likely get this shirt accidentally washed in warm water washer and dried on high heat @ some point since I tend to forget which clothing needs special care. So, this will likely shrink some but there's still room for it to shrink since its hem is long on my daughter & there's still some looseness to its width. It looks good on her and she wears it buttoned up except for the topmost button. She gives this a 5-star. Will update if this shirt shrinks too much with how I typically launder.Well-recommended.",
