In short, this style of top has a high-cut neck in front and a lower scoop neck in back, similar to a leotard (hence ballet neck). The back scoop on this shirt is pretty modest, but to reiterate, the shirt is NOT printed backwards; you guys are wearing your shirts backwards.As far as quality, this is pretty much exactly what I expect from modern Gap. The fabric is a bit thin, but not to the point of tissue paper; however, you'll want to wash on delicate if you want them to last. I wouldn't buy these at full price, but on sale it's a good deal. The one nice thing about the back not being all that low is that it is very bra-friendly, even if you don't get to show off your shoulders as much. If you like a bit of room in your tops you might want to consider sizing up. I wear a size L in most brands and decided to go with an XL for comfort, which for me was the right decision--it's loose without being baggy when going that route, but if you like form-fitting tops I'd say it's otherwise true to size.",

Here\u2019s a big BUT, they feel a lot more comfortable wearing the scoop in the front. It feels like it\u2019s pulling my neck back if I wear it with the boat style neck in front. So, if you can get over this, it\u2019s a great fitting top with just enough stretch to be comfortable, not tight. Ignore the logo, because once you put it on, you can\u2019t see it and it doesn\u2019t show through once it\u2019s against your skin. Even the photos show the scoop in the front\u2026crazy!",
