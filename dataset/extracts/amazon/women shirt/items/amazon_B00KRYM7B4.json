The fit is comfortable and does have some stretch. The sleeves hit just below my upper arm so they are not too long. The fabric is light weight but durable. The crew neck is not too high and sits just below my collar bone which is good for a summer shirt.",

No. It doesn't shrink - I tried to shrink it. That's a good thing if you order the right size.Is it soft: Absolutely. It's soft and feels great.Is it sheer? Yes. It's almost too sheer for me, but some people might like the sheerness.Construction: Very well made.Does it hold its shape? So far so good. Many inexpensive T-shirts lose their shape after being washed a few times.I recommend this t-shirt",

Good material, thick and a nice deep black color, pretty soft for 100% cotton. I personally really like the feel of 100% cotton as synthetic fabrics make me sweaty and itchy.Things I didn\u2019t like: Well, it is 100% cotton so \u2026. It will shrink. One of the things I had liked about it initially is that it was a little longer, hit below the hips so won\u2019t ride up my belly as I am moving around. But once I washed and dried it it shrunk and became much shorter. I have since been stretching it out and hanging it up to dry but that just takes extra effort in my laundry routine.",

                "reviewText": "This shirt was fine when it first came and fit pretty nicely, I like the softness and weight of the material, but after wearing it a couple times it started to shrink. It didn\u2019t shrink to where it necessarily got tighter and that part of it still fits fine but now it\u2019s on the shorter side. I can still wear it and do every now and then but I don\u2019t love the way it fits now because it feels weirdly wide and short. I have a fairly long torso so it may not be as bad on everyone and I\u2019m sure a lot of people wouldn\u2019t care that\u2019s it\u2019s a little shorter; but be aware that it\u2019s going to end up shrinking shorter.",

                "reviewText": "This Hanes Crewneck T-Shirt proved to be an exceptional find, especially considering its budget-friendly price of around $5 which during my college years was a saving grace. It is simple and versatile, this is an excellent choice for various purposes, with a few considerations regarding its texture.Budget-Friendly Excellence:The standout feature of this t-shirt is its remarkable value for money. Priced at approximately $5, it offers an unbeatable combination of affordability and quality. I bought 5 of these t-shirts that lasted me through my college years and looked great paired with anything! I had to get rid of a few of them over time due to deodorant built up (not the t-shirt's fault, it took me a while to realize that the culprit was a stick deodorant that ruined most of my clothes before I switches to spray) that I was not able to get rid of. PRO TIP: a mixture of dish washer soap, baking soda and hydrogen peroxide takes care of this issue (and odor) within a few hours with no exception! Anyway, I ended up repurchasing these shirts a few times because of their price, comfort and versatility.Crafting Potential:The t-shirt's plain design lends itself well to creative projects. Whether you're into crafting or looking for a canvas for appliques, the Hanes Crewneck T-Shirt serves as a blank slate, allowing for personalized touches and artistic expressions. I personally never tried using this t-shirt for crafting opportunities but I figured for the price it might be a great option for crafts enthusiasts!Texture Consideration:While the t-shirt boasts various merits, one consideration is its texture. It may not be the softest option available, which could be a potential downside for those who prioritize a plush feel. However, it's well worth the money and I believe that the lack of softness and stretch helped extend the longevity of this shirt as it never got stretched out and the crewneck remained intact after many rounds of going through the washer and dryer and less than gentle handling!",
