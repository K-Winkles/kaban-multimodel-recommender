                "reviewText": "My wife got this because she liked the design and thought that it looked different from any tops that she already has. I think the top looks nice on her and that the colors complement her.She says the following about this top:PROS:- Fabric is soft and smooth. The ribbed fabric is a little thicker than a t-shirt consistency, but not thick like a ribbed sweater or corduroy.- It is a longer shirt, but not long by tunic standards. The shirt pairs well with leggings and when worn with jeans the shirt can be fully scrunched/tucked or the front portion can be tucked (like the model on the product page).- Easy to care for; just washed in cold water and laid flat to dry. No sweater balls, no shrinkage, and the top kept shape.- Feels casual and comfortable, but looks trendy and the neckline, along with black color at the neck/upper chest allows the opportunity to wear a nice pendant or chain.- Got the, 'B Black', color option, but the other color options look equally as interesting. She may get another one in a different color.- Would make a great spring, summer, or even fall top.- This is a looser top and the, 'Large', size fits nicely with room to spare, usually a 10/12, 5'7\" and 140lbs.CONS:- The tunic length may be too long for some as it does extend to the bottom of the butt.BOTTOM LINE:- Nice top for a casual spring/summer afternoon that hits the mark for style and comfort. It looks best worn with leggings, jeggings, or jeans.",

                "reviewText": "Very unique and cute top. The first thing I noticed when I took this out of the package is how soft it is and how stretchy it is. I ordered true to size from the size chart and it fits perfect. I really like the uniqueness of this top with the color blocking that is so subtle it makes you look twice. The texture is unusual with the raised ribbing or striping but it\u2019s so tiny and being raised it\u2019s very unique and then usual which I really enjoy. I like not wearing what everyone else wears. This top is very comfortable ,lightweight ,Madewell ,extremely cute and can be worn with just about anything . I\u2019m really glad I ordered this .",

                "reviewText": "The EVALESS Women's Summer Short Sleeve Crewneck Tunic Top is a breath of fresh air on a hot day. The lightweight fabric drapes effortlessly, keeping you cool and comfortable, while the color block design adds a touch of visual interest. But before you snag this breezy top, let's dive into its strengths and weaknesses: Sunny Side Up:Comfy Cruiser: The soft, thin fabric feels like wearing a cloud. It's breathable and perfect for those sweltering summer days. Plus, the loose fit flatters various body types and allows for a full range of motion.Mix and Match Maestro: The color block design elevates this simple tunic beyond a basic tee. Dress it down with jeans and sandals for a casual vibe, or pair it with a skirt and wedges for a chic summer evening look.Layering Hero: This tunic effortlessly plays the layering game. Throw it on over a swimsuit for beach cover-up, or layer it under a cardigan for cooler nights. Cloudy with a Chance of Snags:Size Up for Sunshine: While the loose fit is flattering, it can border on baggy, especially in the armholes. Sizing up might be necessary for a more polished look.Short Story: The tunic's length hits mid-thigh, which might be too short for some preferences. If you're looking for something that covers the bum, this might not be your best bet.Wrinkle Woes: The lightweight fabric, while comfy, does have a tendency to wrinkle easily. Be prepared for a quick iron before heading out the door. Overall, the EVALESS Color Block Tunic Top is a comfy and versatile piece for your summer wardrobe. Its breezy fabric and stylish design make it a great choice for casual outings and layering. However, keep in mind the potential for bagginess, short length, and wrinkles before adding it to your cart. Consider your style and needs to decide if this sunny addition will brighten your summer days.",

                "reviewText": "I like this shirt a lot and didn't know I would. I ordered it because I wanted a comfortable casual T type shirt that had a little more style. I wanted something that I could wear to go outside of the house without having to feel like I have to embellish it with jewelry or a scarf. The color blocks on this shirt do just that. It looks good on, yet is a relaxed fit and is so comfortable. It is true to size in a 2x. It is a good length, a little longer than most shirts run these days, yet not a tunic. Easily one of my favorites.",

I like that the sleeves are longer. It's not a thin fabric but it will move with you. It was so comfy, I didn't want to take it off. I chill easily but can & will wear this now and not wait until Spring. If you purchase this, I got a feeling you'll be putting this on pretty often.",
