These tanks are so stretchy, comfy, and they are somewhat compressive, making them supportive for larger chests! I am five months postpartum with DD deflated boobs and I got these to sleep in as I hate not wearing a bra\u2026 they are absolutely perfect for such and exactly what I was looking for. My only complaint is that I wish they were just a liiitttle bit longer, but I am 6ft tall so the average woman probably wouldn\u2019t have my same complaint. I will def be purchasing in more colors!!",

The M made me look slimmer but I did not like how tight it was on my chest and my armpits. The L fit nicely but the straps were loose and I knew they would fall down when working out. Also the neckline is more square than what the pictures show. I do like the material a lot and have faith in this brand so I will be purchasing their other products.",
