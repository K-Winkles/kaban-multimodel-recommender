                "reviewText": "I have now purchased four of these tops in different colors. I also purchased a couple in the same Amazon Essentials line with the same fabric and 3/4 sleeves. The only drawback I\u2019ve found is that the surface of the fabric shows pilling easily, although the pills are very small and hard to see, at least so far.Pros: the fabric is incredibly soft and comfortable on my skin. The fit is good - I usually wear a 1x or 2x top and the XX Large fits me well. The drape is nice and very flattering; the fabric is just heavy enough to drape well. The colors are as shown on my system and my only complaint is that there aren\u2019t more of them. I laundered them in cold water and delicate low heat in the dryer with no shrinking or bleeding of dye.Cons: the fabric showed pills very quickly, although so far that pilling on the surface is tiny so it\u2019s not visible except up close. I\u2019m not rough on clothes like this so I was surprised. I also suggest laundering them inside out to protect the surface.I recommend this top highly, including other tops in the same Amazon Essentials brand that have the same fabric with mock necks, sleeves etc.",

It was long, but not very flowy. The material was clingy and I didn't like how it clung to my stomach. It wasn't flattering. I wanted to like it but I ended up returning it.",
