However, I washed them in cold water and let them air dry. Would be ok in dryer I am sure if washed in cold. They are very stretchy as in you can stretch them to how you want them. I had not worn one until yesterday. I was wrong! They are long but perfect for leggings or jeans to be honest. I wore with leggings and wanted the front shorter so just tied a little cute knot in the front. Again, I LOVE! They are super comfortable and not to thick or too thin. For reference, I am 5'5\" about 125 pounds but have a larger bust. About a 36C or a bit more.",

It's a great short for everyday wear.I love to bring with on vacation if I will have an opportunity to wear casual clothes. The shirt doesn't wrinkle while packing & is so soft. After numerous washes it will start to get small fabric pilling that isn't super noticeable. I tend to layer my clothes so this is my own fault.I wash my shirts in cold water & they have maintained their original shape. Also shirts made with similar material can be clinging. I haven't noticed it with these shirts. I think the have a flattering fit. If you do need it to stretch (due to weight flucation or whatever reason), it will stretch with you.Would I Recommend/Buy Again: Yes, I own numerous shirts & will be stocking up on next sameQuality: 8/10\u2b50\ufe0fComfort: 10/10\u2b50\ufe0fStretchiness: 10/10\u2b50\ufe0fFit: 9/10\u2b50\ufe0fValue: 10/10 \u2b50\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "I hope the photos helps! I am 5'4, 102#, 34C, size 0 pants/leggings/dresses.This top fits great!! This is the Chocolate Heather, nice rich color! I like how snug the arms and chest area is There is a slight waisted area. The stomach area as you can see is roomy. Not a fan of that, but others might really like this kind of fit. It does feel really nice on. It's not thin, but it's a thinner fabric for sure and I like that alot! Someone mentioned spandex in a review and I would agree with that.It will be a great top for the summer when I'm in the AC and wearing a sweater would be ridiculous. For my Colorado winters, it's idea for right now too. I have ordered this top in 6 other colors/patterns as it's rare to find an affordable top in a X-small at $13.50 (on sale)The collar to end of sleeve length for the X-small is 21\".In the size small it's about 25.5\" (quite a difference) and it definitely looked oversized on me.This top I think would be alot of fun for someone who is pregnant and needs that additional stretch room. I wish I had had it 21 years ago with my Twins. The extra stomach fabric would have been ideal, yet the top fits snug everywhere else. An attractive top for sure. And yes, it can be tucked in well too, I just don't wear my tops like that.The price - spot on when it's on sale at $13.50 and now some colors are on sale for 10.00.",

This is a tunic, which I did not realize until I received it. It is too long and it is narrow in the hips, so it clings everywhere and is very unflattering. I can't imagine this looking good on anyone but a very slender person. Bought 3 different colors, returning them all. Please bring back the swing Tee.",
