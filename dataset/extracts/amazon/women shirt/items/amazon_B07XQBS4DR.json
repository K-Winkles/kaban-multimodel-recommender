A mid weight t-shirt good for mild to warm weather. Might not be my choice in very hot humid weather. I will buy more of these. They run true to size, not small, but trim. Order your usual size for a trim fit that is not too tight. Stitching is solid enough, no threads hanging. I like to use iron on patches to customerize these t-shirts. I had a luncheon where one of the party activities was to select a t-shirt and some iron-on patches from a bowl of 200 and iron them on however you like right there. Women had such fun doing that, not just for kids.",

If you have a belly, these tops probably aren\u2019t your best option. The weight of the material is also perfect - not too thin and not too thick. I\u2019m happy with my purchase! I forgot to mention that the material is also so very soft and comfortable!",

They are super soft and have just enough stretch to be form-fitting without making you look like a sausage. Sadly, Amazon will be getting even more of my money because these are PERFECT!",
