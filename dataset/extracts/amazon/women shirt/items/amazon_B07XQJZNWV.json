The blue color is very flattering. And both work well as stand alone or under clothes. My preference is the Amazon. It feels a lot more comfortable. As for washing, both brands wash up nicely and come out of the dryer without wrinkles and ready to wear. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "These t shirts are both quite long and quite large. At over 5'10\", that works fairly well for me, though.I had read in some reviews that they were quite form-fitting, so I ordered an XL, which seemed to fit my measurements as well according to the chart. I guess they aren't hanging off me, but they are definitely on the loose side given that they are rib knit, and the shoulders are large, whereas I have a rather athletic build. Probably not a good choice for someone with a larger tummy, as I often find tops are tight in the shoulders and hang several inches behind me in the back. This style has perhaps an extra half inch in the shoulders and a half inch to an inch down the sides of my waist, so I assume (unless you want it figure-hugging, in which case you're fine, just buy a smaller size) that it is cut more for an athletic V or a straight-ish H figure.They have a nice thickness to them and the fabric looks good. I purchased black and royal blue, so I can't really speak to transparency; these dark shades are completely opaque! I love the blue. It's a gorgeous shade that brightens my face and yet is easy to wear. I'm the sort of person who looks good in jewel tones, but I don't like huge contrasts and I don't feel comfortable in head-to-toe colour. The blue will work with both my print skirts and should look good with blue or black jeans without a screaming contrast.Before closing, I guess I should mention that there were no flaws, no threads hanging off. Another thing that may be of interest is that the V isn't very pointy. It's a little bit wide and doesn't come to a sharp point. I probably should have got a smaller size so my shoulders would have pulled it out and made the neck more open. It probably would have looked better, as it isn't very deep on me; I feel like perhaps the t shirt is meant to be pulled taut on the body, but that is not my case. Looks like good quality, though (I haven't washed it yet). And I do like the colours I chose. Wish I had gone down at least one size and chosen more colours, though.",

They are flattering too!For reference, I am 5'4\" and weigh 115 lbs. I am a 32D. I initially ordered small, but returned them and got the mediums. The small was too tight around my chest.",

                "reviewText": "Aside from a pair of summer pajamas for my daughter, I hadn't really considered buying Amazon's clothing line. In my mind, I was expecting low quality. I was proven wrong in a great way.I ordered a pair of the Slim Fit short sleeve women's V-Neck tees in black. I've had some health problems and lost a substantial amount of weight, hence the need for some new shirts. Clothes shopping in person is an exercise in frustration. I have a long torso and equally long arms, so clothes are NEVER the right length. Plus I always feel ripped off- what I purchase NEVER holds up. And I launder CAREFULLY.Imagine my surprise when I tried on the tees, and they were LONG ENOUGH. Length is important! I live and work on a farm, and I NEED my shirts to be long. It prevents hay/feed/wood shavings from getting down the back of my pants. I also have a small market garden, and there is NOTHING more frustrating AND painful than sunburning your lower back because your shirt was too short to keep the sun off while tending crops. These shirts are the FIRST in ages that are ACTUALLY LONG ENOUGH. And I LOVE the slim fit, because they sit close to the body- no snagging them on gates/hooks, safer to wear around machinery. Major points right there.So the shirts fit great, and the fabric is substantial without being too heavy or too light (for me at least). The next concern I had was \"How are these going to wash up?\" So I washed them inside out in cold water on a regular cycle, and hung them to air dry. After drying, I inspected them carefully. No annoying pinholes, no seams let go, retained shape. Looking even better!Over the past few weeks, I've washed and worn the tees MULTIPLE times a week. They're still fitting great, no fading, no weird pinholes, are retaining their shape. And I've worn them in the fields, in the barn for chores, for MANUAL labor. And they're incredibly comfortable to boot! So I'm REALLY starting to like these shirts!One last thing that sold me on these shirts: The last time I laundered both tees, I missed one coming out of the washer and accidentally ran it through the dryer on medium heat. When I realized what I'd done, I was POSITIVE that the shirt that went through the dryer was going to have shrunk measurably. After the line-dried tee was completely dry, I laid them on top of one another, and compared them. ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE. Not in size, color, shape, or texture of the fabric. (To be on the safe side, I plan to continue line drying these shirts because I like them so much and want them to last!)Final thoughts:You got me, Amazon. You hooked me in with a 2 pack of tees. I liked them SO much, that last week I ordered a 2 pack of white tees, and a 2 pack of blue/aqua tees. I now have enough shirts to make it through a week of work. And if most of the colors weren't sold out right now, I'd buy more. But I don't like the available colors. I'm really hoping they restock these and keep the cut/fit, because these could easily become my go-to tee.I also see that Amazon has a listing for a slim fit, LONG sleeve tee. It may be summer now, but Wisconsin winter is just around the corner. Those long sleeve tees look like JUST the thing to layer under insulated coveralls and a flannel for winter work. I will be keeping an eye on those, and if they come back in stock, I plan on grabbing a week's worth of those too!As always, I will update my review if anything changes with the product. I will probably update my review and note the date that they start to show signs of serious wear/weird holes/seams fail, just so other customers can get an idea of how long these shirts last for someone who's using them daily and heavily.",
