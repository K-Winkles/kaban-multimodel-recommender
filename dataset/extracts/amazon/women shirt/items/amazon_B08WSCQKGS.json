I tried it on and it is the CUTEST blouse. It fits perfect. Not to tight and not to loose. It is adorable and I just ordered a second one in black. The first one was the black and white mini gingham. For reference I am 5\u20194 and 118lbs. The material is soft and not stretchy at all. I gave it a 4 out of 5 because there is a bit of a stitching issue on in one spot. It\u2019s not enough for me to send it back though.",

It's a perfect top for fall... great short sleeves, thin fabric that breathes and moves, great color and pretty design - plaid without being overly plaid. It is just too big. Too blousy and sits wrong on my shoulders. Wish it came in xs and petite sizes. Returning.",
