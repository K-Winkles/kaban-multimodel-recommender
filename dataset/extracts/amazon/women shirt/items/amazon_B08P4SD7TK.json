The one feature that I love is the puffed sleeves. Curved women look nice with a sleeve that is puffed or padded. I wear it with dress pants, skirts, and jeans. It is very functional for dress, or casual. I bought it in size XXL and could have ordered XL instead. It is a little loose, but looks very nice and I decided to keep it. I highly recommend this lovely and economically priced top.",

                "reviewText": "I was hesitant to buy this top, because of the elastic on the sleeves. I was worried that the elastic would either be too tight or too lose. However, this is a great dupe for a top by Ann Taylor, at a fraction of the price, so I decided to go ahead and purchase it. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and fit of this top! I had sized up because I wanted a loser fit, since I like to knot my tops more than tucking them in, but I'm sure it would have fit just as well if I had ordered it in my regular size (Medium). The fabric is soft and after three washes, it's still holding up with no piling, fading or shrinkage. It's also long enough to tuck in or knot-which is perfect whether you have a short or long torso. I love that it can be worn either casually or dressy: pair it with a pair of jeans or shorts and sneakers for a casual look; or dress it up tucked into a dressier skirt or pants and paired with heels. I just wish they had Red as a color choice, because I would love to get it in that color, but I can definitely yell see myself buying this in White to upgrade my white T-shirt.",
