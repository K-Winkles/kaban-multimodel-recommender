Baby just didn\u2019t like the Philips avent style from the hospital or several other styles we tried. The MAM just seems easier for him to keep in. The glow in the dark one is my favorite as we\u2019re desperate to settle him at the end of the night and it\u2019s easy to pop back in.Cons: \u201cVariety\u201d is not how I\u2019d describe these as I had been looking for three distinct nipple shapes. I didn\u2019t realize the only difference in these is the decorative grip and the images on the ones I received didn\u2019t match what was ordered.I would recommend these for someone looking to try a different style than the philips that are provided at the hospital or for anyone having trouble getting baby to take a pacifier.",
