                "reviewText": "My son is 5 months old at this point, so I ordered the 6-18 month pair since he loved the first set of 0-6 month I got him so much. He didn't start really loving them until he was at least 3 months old. This specific pacifier is what I give him to soothe him to sleep, he will spit out the other brands. I think it's the bulb like shape. I love the design and color options too! I do think the price point is a little high for only two pacifiers though.",
