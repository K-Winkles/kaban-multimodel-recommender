        "description": "Soft, cuddly and so lovable, the Philips Avent Soothie snuggle SCF347/01 is the perfect first friend for baby. It makes Soothie, the pacifier used by doctors and nurses to calm newborns in hospitals nationwide, easy for parents and babies to find. It also keeps Soothie close to baby. The Soothie and stuffed animal detach and can easily be cleaned separately. Just sterilize the Soothie in boiling water or a sterilizing bag and toss the stuffed animal in the washing machine. Then leave it out to air dry. The stuffed animal has a second attachment mechanism for pacifiers with ring handles. Soothie snuggle is BPA free. Soon all of our Soothies will say Philips Avent; but for a while, you may see some products that say \u201cSoothie, Children\u2019s Medical Ventures\u201d and others that say \u201cPhilips Avent\u201d in market. Both are real, authentic Philips Avent Soothies. The product meets CPSC safety requirements and the same high quality standards you\u2019ve come to expect from us.",

The plush itself (pictured) has been through the laundry 10 times and looks very durable.Tip: The detachable ones are way easier. Otherwise you'd have to wash the pacifier with the plush and then WAIT for the plush to completely air dry.",

                "reviewText": "Update:We've had this giraffe for a year now and it's my 15-month-old's absolute favorite thing. She's very attached to it, has learned the word \"raffe,\" and I intend to buy her a second one before sending her off to daycare soon since she sleeps with it at every nap and bedtime.It doesn't hold onto pacifiers very well anymore, so if she still wanted to use them that might be a downside. Thought I think the decreased grip mostly comes from her pulling pacifiers out and chewing on the rubber attachment instead. Not really an issue for us though, since she tends to prefer her thumb for sucking needs at this point.-----After a gifted Wubbanub we received for baby was immediately stolen and destroyed by our dog... I was on the hunt for something that might replace it and I think ended up being a way better option for us.We have a small collection of pacifiers and it\u2019s easy to pop them in and out of this to clean them separately.We haven\u2019t been using any clips, but this helps us keep pacifiers off the floor. It\u2019s much easier to catch if it does fall and if it ends up on the ground, things won\u2019t bounce into some abyss under your couch!Our baby uses this while falling asleep and it\u2019s easy to detach from the pacifier while rocking so that there\u2019s no stuffed animals in the crib with them.I think as baby grows, this will be a great toy (and tool) to grow with them. The only time I don\u2019t love it is in the car seat. When baby was smaller, it sat between their chest and knees with easy. They\u2019re a little taller now, so the can pull the pacifier down. As baby gets bigger, I think they\u2019ll be able to hold onto the toy or we may add a clip into the mix for car rides.Pros:Easy to cleanEasy to attach and detachCan be used with harder pacifiers when baby\u2019s too old for newborn onesCan use with several types of pacifiersCan be used as just a lovey when baby outgrows the pacifierCon:Can pull away from 4 month old baby in the car seat",

They are easy to find because of the color and I love that they don\u2019t have more than one part that could detach, the simple design is perfect. We also have the elephant plushie and the giraffe is just a cute addition for the diaper bag. The plushies help keep the pacifier in place when baby is laying down on back. It has to be removed for sleeping tho so it\u2019s useful to have extra soothies without plushies for bedtime.Honestly I think they are too expensive for such a small plush toy, they are adorable but they are overpriced.",
