                "reviewText": "I bought these for my son who is 15 months old. He has been using the bibs brand of pacifier since he was born but I was getting tired of the price of them, so I decided to give these a try. First off, they are so cute! I love the colors of them. The gray looks a little bit purple but it\u2019s not bad at all! Second, they seem really durable. The nipple part seems really sturdy and well made. It\u2019s not flimsy like a lot of cheap pacifiers. I\u2019d say they are very similar to the mam brand. Will be buying again!!",

                "reviewText": "The pacifiers are indeed lightweight, small, and ideal for preemies or otherwise small babies. The design allowing for an exposed nose, plus air holes, is great for breathability. Having said that, they're almost too small - I worry babies with bigger mouths could accidentally get them in further - and the sides push dents into chubby cheeks! Our baby is a preemie with super fat cheeks, and these just aren't comfortable for him.",
