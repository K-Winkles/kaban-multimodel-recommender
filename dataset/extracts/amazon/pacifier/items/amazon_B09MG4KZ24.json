        "description": "Finally, a pacifier that soothes babies and glows in the dark for parents too! Silicone Mini is an extra light, ultra-small, easy to find orthodontic pacifier that was designed especially for young babies. Loved by newbies - Mini has a 96% acceptance rate*. The Mini pacifier isn\u2019t just for pacifying, but is also developed for comfort, breathing and orthodontic benefits. Clinical studies show that PhysioForma pacifiers actively support baby\u2019s breathing by positioning the tongue forward to maintain an open airway, which is especially important during sleep. Physiological breathing improves quality of sleep and reduces irritability.The unique angle and lateral curve of the nipple evenly distribute tongue pressure across baby's palate. Tiny ridges and an inclined nipple shape guide proper tongue placement. Together, these important features support baby's growing palate and teeth.Gentle against baby's delicate skin, the soft silicone shield is comfortable and breathable. Ventilation holes promote air circulation & help reduce moisture buildup.One-piece silicone construction conforms to the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 guidelines for pacifier usage. Another benefit of the one-piece design - parents can insert finger inside the nipple for extra bonding with baby.The exclusive PhysioForma nipple design was developed, tested, and approved in partnership with an advisory panel of leading neonatologists, pediatricians, and orthodontists.Available for babies 2 to 6m. Reusable sterilizing carry case included. Glows in the dark for nighttime use.",

However, the glow lasts well over 10 hours. It's easy to spot the pacifier in the dark of the early mornings.Easy to clean.The container is easy to use and small for carrying on the go. Works well in the microwave to sterilize the pacifiers.The hollow nipple is a bit of a catch-all with animal hair, lint, and dust which is hard to clean out when you are not near a sink.",

I typically prefer the more standard paci over the silicone but these hold up so well and are shaped nicely. Easy to sterilize and you don\u2019t have to worry about them trapping water. The glow and the dark feature on these is nice and bright unlike others I\u2019ve tried. I love Chicco products. They put a lot of thought and effort into their designs.

                "reviewText": "These pacifiers are the only ones my baby will use. They are super easy to wash by hand but also come with a sanitizing case making it super easy to keep them clean and protected. I will say that we have never been able to get them to glow in the dark so if you do drop them it can be harder to find them due to the clear color but still worth it. The shape of the pacifier also makes it easy for my baby to get a good latch so it isn't constantly falling out of his mouth. Overall great option!",
