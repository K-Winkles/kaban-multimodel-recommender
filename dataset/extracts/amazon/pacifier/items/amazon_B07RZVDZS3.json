Because of the design, they stay in her mouth better than the other brands that we have used which can be too small or have too much weight on the base. I love that these glow in the dark, making it easy to find in the middle of the nights, but I have noticed that the glow doesn\u2019t last very long. They are also flashy enough that I can find them hiding amongst the house hold items (on those days when the house isn\u2019t clean....most days). I was worried that they would take up too much of her face because there is so much plastic around the outside part, but it really doesn\u2019t. They look good, stay in and I love not having to worry if they are messing up anything in her mouth, since they are the orthodontist approved ones!",

I love these because they are similar in shape to the silicone pacifiers and the 6+ month mam pacifiers. The shape has been great for breastfeeding and my kiddo keeps them in her mouth. I love that water cannot get into the tip of the paci. The glow in the dark feature is a life saver along with the flat circle top. My kiddo likes to have her hands by her face and knocks out all other pacifiers. I wouldn\u2019t suggest these for newborns, my kiddo gagged on them any time we tried them before she was about 4 months, she was tiny and I think they went too deep into her mouth and were too wide when she was younger.",

It's so cute to see his little hands and face go diving for it :) I also like that I can find them when they fall on the floor in the middle of the night.My first child liked these too and they are the only brand of pacifiers we use. Not sure about the teeth aspect, but hey, whatever works. They've soothed both my babies, especially when teething.",

So I went on a search for an orthodontic pacifier and am so glad I found these. He had no problem switching to these. I can\u2019t speak for durability since I haven\u2019t had them long but as of right now they seem to be good quality. The glow in the dark works great, you just have to make sure you leave it in the light to charge during the day(I just leave them by the window but not in direct sunlight) and it usually lasts through the night but of course they are not as bright anymore in the mornings. I did however receive a different design for the boy ones then pictured but no big deal they were still blue just with a different center part design. Will also be purchasing the day ones now.",

I've used them on most of my kids except 1 and totally regretted it and transitioned her at 1. My 3rd kid was so picky we went with a different brand and now she's having speech delays. With kid 4 I made sure to go back to mam brand pacifier from day 1. These are just better for development. They are easy to sterilize if you have the little container. The only downside is trying to get a clip. I'm not a fan of running a string through the pacifier because it rubs their face, the mam clips I haven't had much luck with. I've used the rubberband type and just loop it around the button part it works for babies but my 22 month old rips it off but she only gets a pacifier at night so its not that big of a deal.",
