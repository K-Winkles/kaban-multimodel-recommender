These are easy to clean, baby can hold them easily, and works especially well for breastfeeding mothers as I feel it didn't cause any nipple confusion.Down side, moisture gets in the nipple really easy so you can't submerge them in water. I boil them when I first get them for 5 minutes, use tongs to squeeze the nipple to fill with the boiling water then use tongs again to squeeze the water out. After that I wash them with soap and water and put them in the sterilizer.I typically get new ones every month because they get lost.",
