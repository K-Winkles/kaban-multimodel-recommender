Yes it's larger, but so important for the growth and development of the mouth to have that larger size. I'm super aware and cautious with when it's used and how it's used. As a preschool teacher I really don't want her having it all the time , specially when trying to talk or learn to talk. It's one reason I like the larger size. It's for safe self soothing during times when sleeping or needing comfort. Granted we all have different opinions and parenting philosophies, I'm very pleased and feel it's very safe and great quality.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. We\u2019ve used the bibs deluxe dummies almost exclusively since my daughter was born. She loves the round latex dummy teats - I guess you don\u2019t always have a choice over which one they like, but these were the best we were able to find.Unfortunately they aren\u2019t made for the 18 month+ category, so we moved over to the standard Bibs dummies. Beyond the marginally cheaper price, I have not been such a huge fan, and neither has my daughter.Most notably, the teat size is a huge step up from the size below. Ridiculously so. My daughter hated them. In fact she\u2019s rejected them entirely. Even now at age two she won\u2019t take them and still just calls them \u2018fat dodie\u2019 and throws them away. I\u2019ve included a picture comparing them to the Bibs deluxe size two dummies.The colours are still lovely, but I do like the design less than the deluxe dummies. The ring moves around too easily and makes an audible rattle - far too distracting to play with for a little one that needs to sleep. I also don\u2019t love the look of the teat forming a ring above the plastic circle. The design reminds me of the Frigg dummies, though a little less nice.We obviously haven\u2019t really tested the functionality of these dummies over the long-term, but if they\u2019re anything like other Bibs dummies they will be hardy, easy to clean and will avoid indentations on your child\u2019s face due to their design.Such a shame about the size. I could have lived with everything else.",
