        "description": "Keep your toddler calm with a binky that you will both love. The MAM My Little Farm Pacifier was developed by leading pediatric dentists and developmental psychologists to provide maximum comfort and style for babies sixteen months and older. MAM pacifiers feature an innovative nipple designed to promote healthy oral development so you can soothe your toddler with confidence. Older babies will love latching onto the soothing pacifier nipple that, with the help of a built-in air channel, naturally flattens and extends when sucked, mimicking a human nipple during breastfeeding. And all MAM pacifiers are orthodontic, featuring a symmetrical nipple that fits perfectly in baby's mouth at any angle. MAM's medically engineered nipples all feature life-like, SkinSoft textured silicone that feels more natural, just like mom. With multiple pacifier shapes and shield sizes to pick from, MAM nipples are easily accepted by babies of all ages, with 94% nipple acceptance among babies tested. Babies simply love the ease and comfort of latching onto MAM nipples. Plus, the sterilizing storage case makes it easy to keep baby safe from germs with fast, easy cleaning right in the box. Developed with the International Children's Medical Research Society. Market Research 2009-2017, tested with 1,508 babies.",

I've tried substituting other binks that are almost identical in size, Avent, Gerber, Tommy Tippee, and at the very least he holds onto it, with his Mam, and treats it like a toy. Other than his occasional chewing on them and creating holes they've always held up well. Silicone is thick, we recently graduated to the 16 month + which is slightly larger. Almost can't tell but it is. Hard to find these under $3.50 but you get what you pay for, especially with baby items. Mommy LOVES the sterilizer box, so very handy for quick sterilizing especially when they grow older and you no longer need to sterilize EVERYTHING. If you get a minute, (what's that, right?!\ud83e\udd23), definitely check out the website. Super sweet and loving, an all around good company! My only complaint is that I wish they were more available in stores, in a bigger selection. When the stores have them, it seems like it's usually the nighttime glow-in-the-dark model. Hey, after a while tho, u no longer notice, or care, that your kid constantly has a 'beddie bye bink' with the moon & stars that glows!",

(or as i call them, bubble sides!). hope you like this review and i cannot say enough about it! thank you mam, and amazon.",
