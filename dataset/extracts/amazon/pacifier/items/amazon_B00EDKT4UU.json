The pacifier is the perfect size for and young infants maybe up to six or eight months old, not too much older than that. It is firmly, I mean firmly attached to the stuffed animal. The little stuffed animal reminds me of little beanie babies, but smaller and a little lighter.My grandson is only three months old and he was a preemie, but when he got his little hands on this pacifier combo, he would not let go. His mother and father were so surprised to see him actually reach for this little pacifier and put it in his mouth himself. He wont let ho of it. They love it too because they don't have to worry about him spitting it out or dropping the pacifier to the floor so much. The weight of the little stuffed animal, even though it is really light, does keep the pacifier near or on the baby when he lets go. The little animal is not so big that it would be too much weight on his chest or cause worry of it occluding his breathing. It's just the right size.",

                "reviewText": "My daughter absolutely LOVES her WubbaNub! I introduced it at a little over month originally because she had such a horrible time keeping pacifiers in her mouth! She would get so frustrated and angry. While the WubbaNub didn't solve ALL of our issues, it certainly helped. My daughter is exclusively breastfed and isn't really fond of pacifiers, but she absolutely adores her WubbaNub tiger. Now that she's older (4 months), she likes to hold on to his little legs or pet it. She honestly spends more time with the stuffed animal part than the pacifier!Her caretakers at daycare noticed how much it soothes her. We forgot it one day and well, let's just say that wasn't a good day for anyone... I think it's adorable that it gives her both something to suck on (and sometimes gnaw on), as well as comfort with the stuffed animal. I'll be sad when we have to take it away when she actually starts sprouting teeth! We'll probably just cut it off the pacifier and sew it closed, ha.To clean it, I usually just wipe off the pacifier. Since she takes it to daycare, I'll handwash the tiger in Dapple soap at least once every week or so and then hang it to dry.",

                "reviewText": "My son is a micropreemie and loves his pacifiers, but can\u2019t always hold them in his mouth while sleeping, but if it falls out, he\u2019ll wake up. He loves his Wubbanub because it\u2019s so much easier for him to grab onto and hold than just a plain paci, and also because the slight weight of the stuffed animal is just enough to keep the paci from falling out in his sleep. Love the selection of animals! We got a tiger for the Cincinnati Bengals (who Dey!). Pretty much the only complaint I have with this is that the paci isn\u2019t removable, unlike the Philips Avent Soothies, which does make it harder to keep clean.",

                "reviewText": "I originally thought it was crazy to spend this much on a pacifier/tiny stuffed animal.... but good lord it's definitely a lifesaver! Easier to find when it is dropped or left on the floor somewhere, comforting to my kiddo (and he could get it into his own mouth even when he was verrrrry young), and totally worth every penny. We bought two because we wanted a backup in case we misplaced it before nap time or it needed to be in the wash, etc...... and then when the 'backup' went missing we got another backup one....In short, Wubbanubs are great. get one. or two if you're smart. ;)",
