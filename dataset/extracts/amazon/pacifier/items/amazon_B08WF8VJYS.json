With the other ones, she would accept them for a little while, then spit them out and freak out lol. With these, she does not spit them out. They only fall out when she falls asleep with them. I highly recommend these pacifiers. They have really made calming my baby much easier--they really do pacify her! Plus they are super cute and come with a convenient case. Also they are easy to clean!",

                "reviewText": "My baby has preferred this particular binky from the time she came home from the hospital. Very affordable and doesn\u2019t leave marks/irritation on her face. Only caveat is that it is a two piece binky, so you need to make sure to thoroughly clean and dry. When washing, water does get inside the nipple, making sure you get all of the water out is important and sometimes difficult",
