Mam, Nuk, Philips avent, Dr. Browns, and even some smaller brands that claim to have shorter nipples. My baby gags on EVERY pacifier we\u2019ve given him. For some reason it\u2019s ONLY pacifiers since his bottles don\u2019t bother him at all.My baby is teething now and I want to give him a \u201ccomfort\u201d item he can keep on him at all times and he\u2019s not super into the teethers. I decided to just try this natural rubber pacifier since it had really good reviews online. My baby can suckle the pacifier without any gagging or discomfort. He also LOVES chewing on the nipple and the sides when his gums are hurting. I\u2019m so glad we found this brand! We will be buying more to replace overtime and keep him stocked up at daycare. Thank you for creating such a usef item for babies with special needs or special aversions. I can\u2019t thank you enough for giving me something I can give to my baby to help soothe his little gums, teeth, and comfort him after he eats.",

                "reviewText": "My daughter is almost 3 months old and has always choked and gagged on every pacifier my husband and I have ever given her. My son was never this way so we were a bit thrown off by this. I do know that some babies just don't like or accept a pacifier but I was determined to find some kind of pacifier that she could use to help soothe her, if needed. This pacifier has been the only one she has not gagged on and will consistently use if we offer it to her. I will note that we only offer it to her after meal times if she is going to take a nap. The only downside I would say for this pacifier is the smell was awful when we first used it. The smell lasted for like 2 weeks but it's gone now. It literally didn't matter how many times we put it through the dishwasher, smell didn't go away. I guess it just had to go away on it's own. Overall I'm pleased with this pacifier. It's a very soft and flexible material so if my daughter were to drop it out of her mouth at night while sleeping, it won't hurt her or be uncomfortable if she rolls over onto it (like turns her head onto it I mean; she can't roll over yet). Overall I'm pleased with this pacifier. Its pricey but has been worth it so far.",
