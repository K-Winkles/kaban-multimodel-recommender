NUK's asymmetrical nipple naturally fits baby's palate and is now improved to allow for more room for a natural sucking motion, reduce pressure on teeth and jaw, and helps prevent teeth misalignment. Invented over 60 years ago by pediatric dentists and doctors, the NUK pacifier is modeled after the natural shape of mom's nipple while breastfeeding. This makes for an easy transition from breast to pacifier and back. The NUK heart-shaped shield fits perfectly under baby's nose for easier breathing and prevents irritation. (Based on Market Research, 2017, tested with 307 pacifier users).",

They are light weight compared to other styles and brands and seem to fit their mouth really well because they like them and can suck on them all night. With other brands and styles they would show little to no interest and would spit them out.The two glow in the dark pacifiers are perfect for nightime too because it makes them easy to find in their bassinet in the dark.These are easy to clean, we just throw them in the sterilizer and the 5 pack is a great value for the money - especially when we seem to lose them left and right!Overall these are the best pacifiers and I just ordered and pack!",

They're easy to put on straps and we've never had trouble with nipple confusion or anything like it. I moved him up to this size at 4 months since I didn't want more teeny ones he'd just grow back out of, and there was no trouble. I can put them in the dishwasher. The only downside is that water can get in the nipple when it's being cleaned (or drooled on) and though you can squeeze it back out, over the months it looks awfully cloudy on the inside. The outside is completely sanitary, but it looks a little icky after a couple months.",

                "reviewText": "At the hospital they gave my baby a pacifier to soothe him but he kept accidentally spitting it out. I had already purchased these prior to his arrival and I'm glad I did! These work so much better for him because it has the little handle so he can hold onto it and put it back in his mouth if necessary!The designs I recieved were not the ones in the picture, but that's fine, they were still cute! We have about 12 nuk pacifiers now so we can rotate them out to clean them and I'm very happy with them!Only complaint is the nipple does take in a lot of water during cleaning and it can be a pain to get it all out. Also finding alot of hair wrapped around the base of the nipple, but that's probably because we have so many animals, not the pacifiers fault.",
