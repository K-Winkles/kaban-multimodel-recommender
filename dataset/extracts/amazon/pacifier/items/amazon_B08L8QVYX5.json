The silicone squeeze spoon has a questionable shape, me and my husband had a good laugh about it when I pulled it out of the box. The only thing, I wish the squeeze spoon had a flat bottom where the food goes in so it stands upright with the spoon facing up. It comes with a stopper to separate the food/spoon halves though so it doesn\u2019t leak. Very happy with this purchase.",

The only issues I have is that the silicone feeder does leak with the cap on it and they do stain very easily. My personal experience was with any baby food with a yellow or orange tint. However, the hard plastic on the spoons does detect heat very well compared to other products of its kind so it's a give and take in that situation. Overall a great set for teething babies or a momma on the go. Just a side note, the rubber on the teething binkies is very thin so if your little one already has a few pearly whites they will rip through it so be mindful.",
