They can grab them and pull them to their mouths by themselves at just a couple months old which is super helpful for us. Thr bear is super cute too! It's a little inconvenient to completely clean...most of the time we just wash and rinse the pacifier part. But it's easy enough to throw in the washer or wash with soap and dry longer. Just have to have a large enough stash of pacifiers!",

This makes it so much easier to find when it falls out especially in the car seat!Update: My son has had 4 of these- he\u2019s almost 2 years old. He loved his original so much we needed back-ups! His original bought when he was born is still going strong! Only one ended up breaking and that\u2019s because he bit it when about 19mths.We have been extremely satisfied with these. Wash well in the machine. Hold up great. And my sons go to for soothing himself.He\u2019s starting to give up his pacis now but these pacis have made naptime, and bedtime so much easier for almost two years! Great purchase!",

Over the time he's been using these pacifiers, he has learned to grab them and put them in his mouth, an ability I believe he wouldn't have gained nearly as quickly or as adeptly had he been using regular pacifiers without the attached plushy.I love that I can throw these in the washer, and they come out beautiful.I own 3 of them now, and my son ABSOLUTELY loves these pacifiers. He's 6 months old and he still uses them and they're all in perfect condition even after LOTS of use and washes.They're also THE CUTEST pacifiers out there.GET THEM!",
