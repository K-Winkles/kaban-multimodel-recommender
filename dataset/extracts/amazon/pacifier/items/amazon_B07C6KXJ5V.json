I wanted a pacifier that didn\u2019t have any pictures or logos, so that when baby inevitably was fussy for pictures and required a binky, the shots wouldn\u2019t be too distracting. This pacifier is darling and fit the bill! Additionally my daughter loves it! It might be her favorite paci now. I think it\u2019s because it\u2019s a little bit bigger than some brands but I couldn\u2019t say for sure why she likes it, just that she does! It\u2019s all one solid piece, which I also love since it\u2019s easy to clean and I don\u2019t have to worry about mold getting in cracks or crevices.",

                "reviewText": "I love these pacifiers! We have ordered three and each time the quality was excellent. They come in a cute bag and have clear instructions included on how to care for your pacifier . I was a little hesitant to try these pacifiers, because There were no Amazon reviews on them, but I decided to give them a shot because they were a lower price point for a natural rubber pacifier. I have been so happy with them. The bulb of the pacifier is a little bit large, so my baby gagged a little bit the first few times we tried it out. She quickly got the hang of it, and I actually feel like it stays in her mouth better than other types of pacifiers do. She has always had a strong suck and does great with a Soothie. We have been very happy with this purchase Knowing that she\u2019s not sucking on cheap, and potentially harmful plastic chemicals, all day long.",

I tried the natursutten 0-6, however, the teat was much smaller on those and my baby didn\u2019t take to them (probably good for a newborn baby.) The 0-6 month rounded Sweetie pacifiers are the perfect replacement for Itzy Ritzy!I will say the rubber smell is stronger in these pacifiers than the other rubber ones I\u2019ve tried, however, if you wash with soap and water prior to and after boiling, it fades quickly.",

This one is great because it's thick and sturdy rubber so it can take it rough \ud83d\ude02 my son chews it and tugs on it as well as binks with it and it holds up strong. We used tommee tippee before these and they are great for actual infants but the silicone is easily punctured and can't withstand any wear and tear. Highly reccomend for older babies like 1yr+ who start to chew on their binky but still need the comfort.",

                "reviewText": "We have tried countless brands.. my son would take a soothie but couldnt keep it in his mouth and he likes the old school Gerber rounded bulb paci but I like that these are one piece. Opened the little bag.. followed the simple instructions of boiling and it was ready to use. No crazy smells.. it does have a slight rubber smell if you stick your nose straight to at first but what else can someone expect of an all natural rubber paci (I've read tons of reviews complaining of a rubber smell from a rubber paci \ud83d\ude02) it's very soft and more pliable that a regular silicone paci. Another plus is it's a tad cheaper than some of the other brands of natural rubber paci's.. My son took this instantly and loves it! We will be buying more!!",

The 6-12 month one is an ideal size for a dummy. 12-18 is more like a over used 'favourite' dummy, that needs to be thrown away because the teat has expanded so much. However it is very thick, unlike the over used 'favourite' one. The 6-12 one has helped our son successfully disown the old favourite 'bibs' dummy. Its also not as thick as the 12-18 one. I would recommend. They are easier to clean, and you don't have the worry of the teat coming away from the plastic.",
