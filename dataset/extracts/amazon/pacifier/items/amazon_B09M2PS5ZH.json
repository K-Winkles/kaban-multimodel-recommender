After doing a little bit of research, I found the Frigg pacifiers! They have similar high quality materials, look super cute and minimalistic, and this particular model has glow in the dark features. I also appreciate that these are a dollar or two cheaper than the bibs product. So far, I am really impressed with the Frigg brand. It's held up well, even with a teething infant. They are easy to clean or sanitize, and my babies have no issues switching between the frigg and the bibs binkies! I also am a happier mama when I come into their bedroom in the middle of the night and can spot the soft glow of the pacifier on the floor!",
