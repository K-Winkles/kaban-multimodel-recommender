        "description": "The crown jewel of baby essentials. Jewl is Boon\u2019s patented orthodontic baby pacifier, designed with a pediatric dentist to provide your baby with a truly soothing experience. Jewl pacifiers focus on the type of sucking your baby does when self-soothing, which is different from the suck of a feeding baby. This baby pacifier takes self-soothing to the next level with two different patented designs you\u2019ll only find with Boon. The gem-shaped nipple encourages tiny tongues to stay in the proper place for a comfier suck. And the arced shield of the pacifier is designed to touch less of baby\u2019s sensitive skin for better airflow and free jaw movement. Pacifiers may not be the first of your baby essentials added to a baby registry search, but they\u2019re a baby essential that many parents find themselves scrambling for after the baby has arrived. JEWL features biometric sizing that helps parents know which stage is best for their growing child. Science aside, there\u2019s also a variety of Boon-approved colors to choose from. After all, when your baby\u2019s mastering self-soothing, they might as well look great doing it.",

My only problem with these is my baby does not like the form of these.. I wish he did because these are obviously better for his teeth. So these are better than the traditional ones if you can get your kid to like the shape!",
