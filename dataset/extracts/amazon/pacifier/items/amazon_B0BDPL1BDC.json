        "description": "The instinctive action of sucking helps to calm and soothe babies and all parents know there\u2019s nothing more wonderful than a calm, content baby. So, when you need to turn screams and sobs into smiles and sleep, simply pick up a Tommee Tippee Moda pacifier.As the symmetrical silicone baglet is fully reversible, there is no \u2018wrong\u2019 side-up so the pacifier will always be placed correctly in your baby\u2019s mouth, even when they put it in their mouth themselves. The curved shield sits comfortably between baby\u2019s chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby\u2019s delicate skin against irritation.The BPA-free silicone baglet is soft and flexible whilst also being robust and durable. The smooth surface of silicone is very easy to clean and won\u2019t absorb stains and odors. Simply pop in a sterilizer, wash by hand or in the dishwasher. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months.*From an independent study in July 2021 of 416 moms with a 0-36m child, who are currently using a Tommee Tippee pacifier: *99% of moms would recommend a Tommee Tippee pacifier *97% of moms say a Tommee Tippee pacifier helped settle baby *93% of moms say babies love their Tommee Tippee pacifier *97.5% of babies accept a Tommee Tippee pacifierWarning! Do not tie pacifier around child\u2019s neck as it presents a strangulation danger.",
