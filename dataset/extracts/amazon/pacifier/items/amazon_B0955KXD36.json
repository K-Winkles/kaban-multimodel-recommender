At first I didn\u2019t connect the two, but after some time I realized that it was the pacifiers. After all they were made out of plastic that touched his mouth and the area around quite a lot. After some research I found this pacifier and loved the fact that it\u2019s rubber and facing the opposite way. My baby\u2019s rash cleared after just couple of days and didn\u2019t return.

                "reviewText": "As a parent, we are constantly in search of products that not only provide excellent quality but also make our lives a little bit easier. That's precisely what I found with the BIBS Pacifiers \u2013 De Lux. This pacifier has quickly become a cherished item in our household for its outstanding quality, size, longevity, and one invaluable feature that makes night-time a breeze.The first thing that struck me about these pacifiers is their top-notch quality. Made from BPA-Free Natural Rubber, these pacifiers exhibit a level of durability that assures me of their safety, a vital aspect when it comes to products my baby uses daily.The 'love' factor from my baby towards these pacifiers is undeniable. After trying several brands, the BIBS Pacifiers \u2013 De Lux are hands-down her favorite. I believe this has a lot to do with the natural rubber that resembles the feel of skin, providing comfort and familiarity.The size of these pacifiers is ideal for my little one. They are designed with the right proportions to fit comfortably in her mouth without being too intrusive or causing discomfort.Durability is another winning aspect of these pacifiers. They simply last longer than other brands we've tried, which means less frequent replacements and ultimately, cost savings in the long run.But the true hero feature, at least for me, is the glow-in-the-dark function of the night edition. Searching for a lost pacifier in the middle of the night is a task no parent enjoys. These pacifiers are easy to locate in the dark, making those night-time wakings a bit less daunting and your baby can find it on their own!",

                "reviewText": "Bibs vs Frigg vs some other brand?! Bibs that are smaller horizontal pacifiers were excellent for our baby brand new! The nipple is smaller and shorter than most others including Mam brand. And importantly, light, so she could actually hold it in herself. The ones like Avent or those thick WubbaNub style ones were too heavy. But she did opt for the longer nippled style as she grew a bit. In fact for us our baby very first wanted the smaller horizontal Bibs brand then as she grew a bit (probably by 3-4 wks) she wanted Frigg brand. And the Frigg and Bib brands look extremely similar. I couldn\u2019t believe it but by golly that little lady could tell the difference!!! No idea how. I tried the rubber version of the Bib and Frigg and she wanted the glow in the dark Frigg so specifically!!! If you hold the Frigg and Bib up side May side there\u2019s is such a TEENY difference in length. So I wouldn\u2019t get too many ahead for cuteness. Just get a single order of each if you think this is the brand you want to try. And if breastfeeding they do recommend NO pacifiers for a while. I followed this with my first. But my second every single ultrasound she was sucking on her hand and even had a hickey/blister on her hand the moment she was born from sucking. So I knew she\u2019d be a paci baby. I did try to avoid it though at first! So if nutrition and FREE baby milk is your top priority maybe consider holding off on any paci! Regardless if you want a way adorable pacifier the color choices are excellent!! Don\u2019t submerge in water. Just quick clean by rinse.",

When we were down to our last of those we decided to try out the single BIBS pacifier we had. We we given a \u201csample box\u201d of different kinds of pacifiers and one was in there.I\u2019d already been told by a friend earlier this year that they were fantastic but found at a week old our little girl who loves sucking, didn\u2019t take to it.We gave it a try again and were super excited by how much she loves it. She couldn\u2019t keep the others in her mouth on her own but with the BIB she\u2019s had no Issues.Now 4 weeks old, she calms right down when she has it and can still spit it out when she decides good and doesn\u2019t want it. She normally does this just before falling asleep.We bought the coral color and love it.",

These do expand with use as do most silicone pacifiers so I make sure to alternate every few days or so to get longer use out of them. Once they get too big I replace them just so she doesn\u2019t get used to the expanded bulb. They are also light weight which I love because it\u2019s easier for her to use and keep in.",
