        "description": "Philips Avent Soothie is the pacifier brand distributed in hospitals nationwide and used by doctors & nurses to soothe newborns. Its one-piece construction is specially sized and shaped for babies 0-3 months old and adheres to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. Soothie is designed to calm and soothe without inhibiting normal oral development, like the natural development of teeth and gums. Transparent, tasteless, and odorless, the nipple is strong and smooth. It won't become sticky, discolored, or misshapen. Soothie is made of hospital-grade, BPA-free, and latex-free silicone for strength, comfort, and durability. It is dishwasher safe and can be sterilized in a sterilizer. Soon all of our Soothies will say Philips Avent; but for a while, you may see some products that say \u201cSoothie, Children\u2019s Medical Ventures\u201d and others that say \u201cPhilips Avent\u201d in the market. Both are real, authentic Philips Avent Soothies. The product meets CPSC safety requirements and the same high-quality standards you\u2019ve come to expect from us.",

                "reviewText": "This is all my daughter would take because she used the jolly pop scented ones in the NICU. She is now five months and is almost weened off pacifiers but this really helped because I wanted her to take one. They told me in the NICU they give them to babies because it helps prevent SIDS and that was a huge concern for me since she had low oxygen and breathing problems. I couldn\u2019t find the scented jolly pop so I used these instead and she took to them easily. She wouldn\u2019t take the un scented ones for some reason. My baby was bottle fed so idk if it affects breastfeeding but after she stopped taking the premade formula bottles they give at the hospital (about 3 weeks after birth) she transitioned well to the avent bottles I guess the nipples are the same/similar. I know if babies take certain bottles they might want to take other pacifiers but anyways to sum up these worked for my NICU, formula fed, avent bottle baby lol.",

Challenge accepted,\" I said with an evil grin. \"I have Amazon prime. Excuse me while I whip this out...\" Then the nurse gasped in horror as I reached into my pants and pulled out my iPhone and started fingering the screen. Within minutes I had ordered these apparently \"hospital exclusive\" pacifiers right from my ultra uncomfortable back-breaking couch in my wifes hospital room. \"I'll have more on my doorstop before we even leave the hospital with the baby,\" I said with a seductive wink. The nurses face was flushed with heat as she embarrassingly left the room. She returned 5 minutes later with coffee for me that I didn't even ask for.",
