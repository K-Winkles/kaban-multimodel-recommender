                "reviewText": "By far my favorite wubbanub. The little lamb is so well made, soft, and totally adorable. I bought it for my infant daughter (0-2 months) who didn't really like to suck on pacifiers at first. She spits them all out. But I really needed something to help sooth her during nights when she's extra fussy and the glider is not enough and when she's wailing during car rides. The sheep adds a little weight so that spitting it out is not so easy. But she can still spit it out so I don't have to worry about her choking on it. We used this exclusively from 0-2 months. Now that she likes pacifiers more, I'm going to try the Binkibear because you can detach and swap out the pacifiers on the Binkibear. The pacifier is attached to the wubbanub so to wash it you have to throw the whole thing in the laundry then air dry...which I don't really like. I still wash the pacifier part after taking it out of the laundry because I don't know if it's that sanitary to put directly in baby's mouth after it's been in the wash cycle with her dirty clothes and linens.",

                "reviewText": "If you're considering a Wubbanub (which you probably are since you're reading this review), get it. I've owned several of these and have yet to be disappointed. The animals are soft and cute. But the best part is that they're easy to find in the car or anywhere really. The weight and orientation of the animal makes it so the pacifier has a more difficult time falling out when baby is reclined or lying flat so there's less waking and crying. When baby gets older they can more easily find their pacifier because they only need to find the animal. And these darn pacifiers can escape or hide in a crib pretty easily by themselves. The animal prevents the crib escape. Get a Wubbanub!! It is the perfect baby shower gift. And this is all coming from a mom of 3 who swore my kids would never use pacifiers... Hahaha",

                "reviewText": "My baby was born in October and has been breastfed since she was born. She never took a pacifier and never took a bottle for nearly 3 months. When it came time for my wife to go back to work we were in a panic because our daughter would not take a pacifier or a bottle. My wife found these and decided to give it a try. The only thing that seemed to sooth her was feeding. When we first received this she didnt take it right away as we expected. We also bought every pacifier that Target and Walmart carried. Now at 4 months she will at least take this and chew on it in the car. It has helped her with soothing while in the car which she hates being in her carseat. We didnt think any pacifier was going to work but this one did! She does not suck on it but she chews on it. So i call that a win!! Plus they are adorable!",

                "reviewText": "I had a feeling my second baby would adore soothies (my first hated then and I just had a hunch). My husband said we should wait and are. Even after my hunch proved correct, my husband stated his skepticism so I went back and forth ordering this. I finally just did it. After my order was conformed, my husband said it seems like the baby is frustrated with his soothie and self weaning himself off it. I got nervous. For the five days I waited for this item, the baby would cry, wanting to constantly be heels, smuggled and wanted absolutely nothing to do with his soothie. I was frustrated and crying at his screaming one morning when I heard the package this on my porch. I type it open, washed the soothie and nervously have it to the baby. It was like magic. the screams turned off, baby has a new friend and off to dreamland they went!The lamb is smaller than I imagined (in a very good way) so it's light and easy for baby to grasp and manipulate, super soft and snuggly, and baby is able to take it out of his mouth and by grasping and routing, found it again on his own. This lamb is my savior.",

                "reviewText": "This is the most adorable pacifier. I love it because it doesn't get lost in the house, baby bag etc. and because our daughter could reach for it more easily than other pacifiers when she was only 2 months. Now that she is 7 months this is her only paciifer. I threw out the other more flattened traditional pacifiers when this one became the favorite. I will be buying another when this one gets tired out. Keep in mind that the pacifier doesn't detach from the plush animal so it can't go in the wash, unless you don't mind washing the pacifier in with the laundry. Hand washing it seems to best choice.",

                "reviewText": "I bought 3 wubbanubs for my daughter. One was the lamb here. You have to like the soothie pacifiers in order to use these because that is the type of paci that is attached to all of them.I started my baby using them when she was only 2 weeks old. They totally helped in not loosing her paci when they fell out of her mouth because the toy doesn't fall far. Sometimes it just drops right in front of her mouth and she's able to suck it right back in.She's 5 1/2 months old now and we've NEVER lost one.They are machine washable on a light cycle then allow to air dry. They wash up really well.Now that my daughter is a few months old, she loves huging and grabbing at the animal attached to the paci, and now she can put it back in her mouth on her own.I'd highly recommend to anyone. They are a great toy and paci in one, and it's sort of like your baby's 1st lovely.UPDATE 10/16/2014!!!!!!!!!!!! MY DAUGHTER IS NOW 4 yrs OLD AND WE STILL HAVE THESE!!! SHES TAKEN TO THE KITTY ONE AT ABOUT 9 MONTHS OLD AND HES HER BEST FRIEND. HE LOOKS TERRIBLE NOW BUT HES LOVED. WHEN WE WEANED HER FROM THE PACI WHEN SHE WAS 18 MONTHS OLD, WE JUST CUT THE PACI OFF THR LITTLE ANIMAL. IT WAS A SMOOTH TRANSACTION FOR HER BECAUSE AT THAT POINT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THR LITTLE TOY MORE THEN THE BINKI. 4yrs old and SHE STILL SLEEPS WITH THIS LITTLE THING IN HER BED AS WELL AS TONS OF ROLE PLAYING WITH THIS LITTLE TOY.",

Ist sein Lieblings Spielzeug. Der Schnuller ist Komplet aus Gummi und das Baby kann alle teile beissen, was vor allem beim Z\u00e4hnewachsen praktisch ist. Reinigen kann mann das alles in der Waschmaschine, trocknet super schnell und den Gummiteil ins heisser Wasser fur eine Minute eintauchen und fertig.

I however havent sterilized it once after an american midwife told me babies dont need it to be sterilized - boobs are far from sterile!My baby is happy, healthy and sleeps a dream.Dont put in washing machine, the grey water in washing machines is full of bugs and at a low temp its not worth risk.Just the odd hand wash in washing up liquid is fine. :)",
