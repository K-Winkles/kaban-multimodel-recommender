The base isn\u2019t hollow except for a tiny channel, which lets the nipple still be squishy.I saw some reviews on toddler pacifiers where they say their toddler was able to bite through them.

                "reviewText": "It seems like the people leaving negative reviews of the slim base of this pacifier are not looking at the images or description on how this style (\u201cPerfect\u201d) is different from the original style.My 4 year old used the original style for the first 18 months of his life and has no bite or teeth issues.My now 18 month old has used this brand in the updated Perfect style from birth. The only differences I can attest to are these:1. They indeed do not come with the blue security tag in the case. However the tag was pretty stringy and did not seem to have much substance to begin with, so I don\u2019t know how secure it actually was in showing the case hadn\u2019t been previously opened. I make sure the seller I purchase these from is Amazon, and it may be naive on my part, but I feel a little less worried in that regard.2. These are easier to bite through than the original. My daughter has bitten through most of them within 2 months of use. So check them often to avoid a potential choking accident.That being said, I do prefer this style as it would seem to have less impact on oral development than the original.The glow in the dark doesn\u2019t do too much for me. I almost prefer a dark color, as it has more contrast against a white sheet than the glow in the dark and is therefore easier to spot in the middle of the night in my opinion.",
