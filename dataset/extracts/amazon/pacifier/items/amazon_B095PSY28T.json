The pacifier is definitely made for smaller babies (my 5.5m old finds it a bit small) but he likes to chew on it and the loop has Velcro so you can change it out with other pacifiers. The penguin is very very soft and the perfect size for little hands. It's not overly heavy so it doesn't weigh down the pacifier. If you like it then I'd recommend ordering a pack of pacifiers in the next size up to go with it so you have them when the time comes as they're not sold in stores.",
