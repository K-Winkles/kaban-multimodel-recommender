        "description": "The instinctive action of sucking helps to calm and soothe babies and all parents know there\u2019s nothing more wonderful than a calm, content baby. When mom\u2019s breast isn\u2019t available, our Breast-like pacifier is the next best thing for baby to latch onto in between feeds. Made from super soft silicone, this pacifier feels, moves, flexes and stretches just like skin so there\u2019s less chance of confusion when feeding baby from breast or bottle. The natural feel and flex of this breast-like pacifier, inspired by our award-winning Closer to Nature nipple, provides a reassuring alternative to traditional pacifiers. Perfect if you\u2019re worried that offering your baby a pacifier may disrupt breast or bottle feeding. As the symmetrical silicone baglet is fully reversible, there is no \u2018wrong\u2019 side-up so the pacifier will always be placed correctly in your baby\u2019s mouth, even when they put it in their mouth themselves. The Breast-like pacifier shield curves away from baby\u2019s face and offers superior ventilation and extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby\u2019s delicate skin against irritation. BPA-free and easy to clean - simply pop in a sterilizer, wash by hand or in the dishwasher. We recommend that you replace the pacifier every month and always at the first signs of damage or weakness. We recommend stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months. *as compared to traditional round unvented pacifiers which do not compress as easily.",

                "reviewText": "Luckily my fourth baby agrees to taking pacifiers and doesn't seem picky. I am also EBF and she doesn't seem too confused. She always has been a bit lazy at shallow latching but she eventually latches ok. This has been since birth. I hope the paci use isn't making her continue this behavior. She does seem to prefer the round paci rather than an orthodontic one. We were given the Avent soother at the hospital and she likes that. I found these since I need more. They are very soft and flexible. The round body part though is hard plastic (for some reason I thought it would be silky silicone too or something). I think it is unnecesssey to have so many holes around the base of the nipple because sometimes it causes loss of suction if her lips aren't formed exactly just so. Sometimes I hear clacking noise as she sucks, not sure why. At least you can attach a paci strap which Avent does not. I have read silicone quality isn't created equal and cheaper ones can leach heavy metals including lead. I contacted the company and they didn't know but emailed me today with the answer\"I have raised the questions you asked and can confirm that our soothers are made of medical grade silicone that does not have any traces of heavy metals or lead\"So hope this answers any quality/toxicity concerns someone else other than me have about this.The pacifier does seem a bit small considering this is for babies without teeth and that could be 6-9 months for many! My baby is 4.5 weeks and it seems like it just is ok for her.",

She likes the nipple shape and feel and we have had absolutely no problem with nipple confusion from using these paci\u2019s. My first child took MAM paci\u2019s and he would get rash\u2019s from moisture build up behind the paci piece around his mouth so I loved the idea of the shape of this paci having no way to have the same issue. But because of the shape of these paci\u2019s my daughter has a hard time keeping them in her mouth. She easily knocks them out while her startle reflex is causing her to swat her arms and when she\u2019s contact napping and moves her head it easily comes out due to how big they are. May work for her better when she\u2019s older but I\u2019m having to order a new type and put these away for now.",

I\u2019d say it\u2019s a little bit heavy for a newborn or infant to keep in the first few times but I\u2019m sure my 4 month old will be get used to it.They\u2019re really easy to clean and I like that it\u2019s just one piece, no handles or anything like that, I like the round shape and that the colors are easy to match with different outfits.I know the pacifier is meant to be like a breast if you\u2019re breastfeeding but I found that it doesn\u2019t really make a difference, your baby will either like it or not regardless of being breast or bottle fed.I would definitely recommend giving this pacifier a try though.",
