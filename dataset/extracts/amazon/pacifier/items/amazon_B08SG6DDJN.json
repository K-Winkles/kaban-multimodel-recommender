I liked the 1 piece design, the soft silicone material, and once I found green, the fact that they were easier to find than the clear ones. Now we have an almost 18 month old and his pacifier is CLEARLY too small. I wish they made these larger as a 6 month old baby's mouth is much smaller than an 18-24 month. These 6+ month ones are about the same size as Nuk 3-6 month and are much too small for the older babies. I have tried every kind I can find that look similar and can't find one that he'll take so I'm very frustrated and worry if he keeps on with these small ones his mouth and teeth won't spread like they're supposed to. Please make larger nipples and give this mama some breathing room before I have to wean him!",

They are alright to clean, but the 6 small holes across the top require the tiny straw brush and the wire sometimes gets stuck in the smallest two holes. And since they are almost clear, they are very difficult to find when he drops them. Regardless of these minor things, I would definitely recommend these and buy them again!",

My almost 2 yo has now bitten through two. I don\u2019t personally mind as the goal is to phase them out completely by her birthday anyway, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind if you\u2019re buying for an older child.",

                "reviewText": "These say they are for six months and up. They are extremely small the nipple is more like for a newborn. I found it very disappointing as they are smaller than the ones we are trying to graduate from. These are a great newborn pacifier I will be using them for the next baby. But my seven-month-old is not into them",
