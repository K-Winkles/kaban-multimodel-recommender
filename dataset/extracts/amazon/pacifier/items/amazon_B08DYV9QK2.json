        "description": "Keep your toddler calm with a binky that you will both love. The MAM My Little Farm Pacifier was developed by leading pediatric dentists and developmental psychologists to provide maximum comfort and style for babies sixteen months and older. MAM pacifiers feature an innovative nipple designed to promote healthy oral development so you can soothe your toddler with confidence. Older babies will love latching onto the soothing pacifier nipple that, with the help of a built-in air channel, naturally flattens and extends when sucked, mimicking a human nipple during breastfeeding. And all MAM pacifiers are orthodontic, featuring a symmetrical nipple that fits perfectly in baby's mouth at any angle. MAM's medically engineered nipples all feature life-like, SkinSoft textured silicone that feels more natural, just like mom. With multiple pacifier shapes and shield sizes to pick from, MAM nipples are easily accepted by babies of all ages, with 94% nipple acceptance among babies tested. Babies simply love the ease and comfort of latching onto MAM nipples. Plus, the sterilizing storage case makes it easy to keep baby safe from germs with fast, easy cleaning right in the box. Microwave disinfection is proven effective in killing common household germs and bacteria. Pacifiers kept in the closed box will remain disinfected for up to 48 hours: Fill pacifier case with water. Place pacifier in the pacifier case with the nipple facing down. Follow pacifier package instructions for microwave setting. Cool completely before use. Developed with the International Children's Medical Research Society. Market Research 2009-2017, tested with 1,508 babies.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the farm pack specifically because it had a red tractor on one of the binkies. My hubby drove a red tractor so I thought it would be cute to have as a first bday gift. I usually buy whatever designs are on sale but I actually payed over 8 because I wanted that dang tractor. It had a long ship time and I still was like, alright I can wait a little longer for that. Well, when it finally showed up, it was a lamb and cat/dog which I'm guessing is the new design. A binky is a binky, but I'm disappointed. The mam brand is great, just know that the design may not be what is shown and there are mams out there for half the price if you don't care what the design is.",
