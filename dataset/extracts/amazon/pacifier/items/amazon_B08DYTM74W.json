                "reviewText": "These pacifiers are great! IF you read the instructions and know how to clean them.So apparently these bigger ones (next level up from the newborn ones) are made differently in that they collect water in the nipple, but it can be emptied out during washing if you squeeze the nipple part with the plastic closer to the ground/ sideways. I've found that when washing, you can squeeze the nipple when holding the plastic part under the water to suck in water to \"rinse\" the inside and then you can squeeze and shake it to empty. Then dry as regular and it should be fine.If you end up having a problem or it's not clearing well, you can always reach out to Mam and they will help you out! Both my husband and MIL didn't know this and I had to tell them because I was the only one who read the directions lolOtherwise, these have been working well since baby has been teething and drooling nonstop! It helps keep the saliva off the face and reduce rash.The 3 pack does not have the sterilizing case though - seems like only the 2 packs do. Enjoy!",
