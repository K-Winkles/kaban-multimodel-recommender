                "reviewText": "When my baby was first born we were gifted so many different brands of pacifiers (big brands, well liked ones) and my baby just did not like them. None of them! We tried so many. Finally we stumbled upon frigg and loved their appearance. And they happened to be the one and only pacifier my baby would take. So we've stuck with them since! We started with the rubber but I definitely prefer the silicone. Easier to clean and lasts longer/more durable.I personally love the appearance of this over all the other more common ones big stores carry but they also happen to be my baby's top choice as well! We've had zero issues with the year + worth of pacifiers we've bought. (Which has been many because they magically disappeared often in the early months)",

They keep tearing right at the base just as shown in the other reviews and the nipple came off completely\u2026 this is a huge choking hazard and I won\u2019t be buying anymore of this style for my daughter out of fear that she could be seriously harmed. I have since purchased the FRIGG Lucky Symmetrical SilkySoft Silicone Baby Pacifier and have had zero issues so far so I feel that we received two flawed packs somehow... If you have this style, *though as with any pacifier*, please make sure you are checking them regularly for wear/tear.",
