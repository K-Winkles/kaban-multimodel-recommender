                "reviewText": "I decided to give these a chance for my 8 month old son, he is used to the Nuk pacifiers and these are the same shape. I was surprised that he had no problem switching to these. I like that these have the handle on the top, the Nuk pacifiers that my son uses do not have the handles. It is easy for him to take the pacifier out of his mouth with the handle, so I appreciate that. The quality is nice, the prints are cute and the nipples are orthodontic so better for his teeth as they grow in. I did have the issue with the nipples holding water inside if they're washed in the dishwasher, so I opted to hand wash them to alleviate this problem. I think this 2 pack of pacifiers is affordable, at the current price of $8, and I would buy them again.",
