        "description": "NUK for Nature\u2122 Comfy Pacifiers feature a one-piece, 100% silicone design that gently contours to baby's face. The heart-shaped shield fits perfectly under baby\u2019s nose for easier breathing and helps prevent irritation. The unique breast-like nipple naturally fits baby\u2019s palate and helps promote healthy oral development. Invented over 70 years ago by pediatric dentists and doctors, NUK orthodontic pacifiers are modeled after the natural shape of mom\u2019s nipple while breastfeeding, creating an easy transition from breast to pacifier and back. You can feel good knowing that the paperboard packaging is made using 100% recycled fibers. The NUK Comfy\u2122 pacifier is made of 100% medical-grade silicone, and is BPA-free and dishwasher-safe (top rack only).",
