I breastfeed, bottle feed, and this pacifier has been able to compare to all of that. Very easy to clean. Durable and last forever. I think I have at least 10 of these exact pacifiers. Not because they don\u2019t last, but you know pacifiers are always falling or getting lost. My baby loves them so much I know I need a back up at all times.",

Especially if you\u2019re waiting for a bottle to warm up in the Dr. Brown\u2019s bottle warmer and sterilization unit. They match the bottle nipple perfectly. It\u2019s made out of soft silicone, and can be sterilized in the Dr. Brown\u2019s bottle warmer and sterilization unit. Reasonably priced, we make sure we buy them frequently, for our home as well as our daughter\u2019s home. Babies love and need to safely suck for comfort as well as nutrition. Dr. Brown\u2019s pacifiers are simply the best. Our three month old grandson agrees.",

They are also easy to attach to any pacifier clip which makes it handy in the carseat or stroller. I purchased another pack.These soothers seemed large compared to several other brands my 4 month old uses, but it's fine. The thickness seems to make it durable and I do like the flat \"butterfly\" shape that doesn't trap drool around my baby's lips. I purchased these soothers because my baby has been using Dr. Brown's bottles. They sterilize fine in a brezza sterlizer/dryer so I'm happy with the purchase.",
