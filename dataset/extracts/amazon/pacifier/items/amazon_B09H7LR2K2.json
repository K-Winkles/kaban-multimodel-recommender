                "reviewText": "These were recommended to us by some friends before we had our little one and these pacifiers have consistently delivered. They've made our parenting journey smoother and more enjoyable. They have helped calm our babe. If you have a breastfed baby who's particular about pacifiers like my little one, I highly recommend giving these a try. They offer the perfect blend of comfort, convenience, and style. We've purchased them multiple times and will continue to do so without hesitation. A must-have for any new parent!Breastfed Baby's Best Friend (5/5): Our baby, who is exclusively breastfed, can be quite particular about pacifiers. However, the MAM Original Start Matte pacifiers have won our baby's heart. They mimic the shape and feel of a mother's breast, making the transition between breastfeeding and pacifier seamless. Our little one took to them instantly and found comfort and satisfaction in these pacifiers. This was great because our little one rejected many other pacifiersSterilization on the Go (5/5): One of the standout features of these pacifiers is the convenient sterilization case they come with. Being able to quickly sterilize the pacifiers in the case is a game-changer, especially when we're on the move. It provides peace of mind knowing that our baby's pacifier is always clean and safe.Durable and Easy to Clean (5/5): These pacifiers are not only well-designed but also durable. They withstand frequent use and washing without showing signs of wear and tear. The materials used are easy to clean and maintain, which is a big plus for busy parents.Stylish and Matte Finish (5/5): The matte finish on these pacifiers adds a stylish touch. It's not only visually appealing but also provides a secure grip for our baby. The design is simple and elegant, which we appreciate. We also match our pacifier to our baby's outfits which looks so cute lol",

They are skinny where the teeth are which I feel helps with the teeth forming and coming in correctly. The designs are adorable and they come with a caring case! Love these! Also the bottles are fantastic!",

We tried it and he loved it!! It\u2019s not tough or a weird shape, it\u2019s soft enough and it\u2019s similar to the bottle and not to far off from the nipple if you are nursing. You also can\u2019t beat the price so it makes it easy to replace them often.",
