She LOVES it!!! I know all babies are different, but this one is really good with her hands and likes pacifiers so being able to easily grasp this with a soft plush baby on the end is a hit with baby and mom for soothing purposes.My drawback would be that it\u2019s obviously going to get dirty and fall on the floor a lot, not having a clip feature. Since the paci is permanently attached I was concerned about cleaning issues, but I frankly just wash the paci with dish soap/water and the baby has gotten completely wet before and dried with no issues or change in appearance. I do live in a dry climate so maybe that helps. Either way, I\u2019m a happy customer so far!",
