        "description": "Having a difficult time finding the right pacifier for your baby? NUK Orthodontic Pacifiers are accepted by 95% of babies* and feature a unique, improved asymmetrical nipple that naturally fits baby\u2019s palate to allow more room for a natural sucking motion, reduces pressure on teeth and jaws, and helps prevent teeth misalignment. Invented over 60 years ago by pediatric dentists and doctors, the NUK orthodontic pacifier is modeled after the natural shape of mom\u2019s nipple while breastfeeding. This makes for an easy transition from breast to pacifier and back. The heart-shaped shield fits perfectly under baby\u2019s nose for easier breathing and prevents irritation. All pacifiers are BPA free and dishwasher safe (top rack only). (*Based on Market Research, 2017, tested with 307 pacifier users).",

                "reviewText": "My daughter loves these but contrary to it's description these are not the pacis you need for a breastfeeding baby or toddler. You would want to find a SUPER thin and soft one with a short nipple (thinner than your own nipples) for best results with breastfeeding in my experience. These in no way mimic a breast, an older baby wont have a big problem with these but they are thick and don't bend easily. For a younger baby you'll be left to exclusively pump or bottle feed if your baby takes a liking to these, they will think they cannot get a good grip on your breast like they can on a paci causing nipple confusion. These are a bigger size but if you're looking to purchase ahead, this is a heads up that nipple confusion can happen easily.Overall these are a good paci, my daughter loves these. The only thing I can complain about is the water is HARD to get out of the inside when you clean it, be careful with soaps of any kind!",
