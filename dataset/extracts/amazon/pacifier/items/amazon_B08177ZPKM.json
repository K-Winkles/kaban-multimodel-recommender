        "description": "The instinctive action of sucking helps to calm and soothe babies and all parents know there\u2019s nothing more wonderful than a calm, content baby. Little mouths don\u2019t always hold onto heavy baby pacifiers which means parents often need to replace the pacifier in their baby\u2019s mouth every few minutes. Our Ultra-Light Silicone pacifier is our lightest ever pacifier and is light enough to stay put in baby\u2019s mouth for longer helping babies to stay calmer, soothed and happier for longer. As the symmetrical silicone baglet is fully reversible, there is no \u2018wrong\u2019 side-up so the pacifier will always be placed correctly in your baby\u2019s mouth, even when they put it in their mouth themselves. The curved shield sits comfortably between baby\u2019s chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby\u2019s delicate skin against irritation. The smooth surface of silicone is very easy to clean and won\u2019t absorb stains and odors. The hygienic, anti-static properties prevent dust from settling and as it has a one-piece design, it is really easy to clean - simply pop in a sterilizer, wash by hand or in the top shelf of the dishwasher. We recommend that you replace the pacifier every month and always at the first signs of damage or weakness. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months *From an independent study in July 2021 of 416 moms with a 0-36m child, who are currently using a Tommee Tippee\u00ae pacifier: \u2022 *99% of moms would recommend a Tommee Tippee pacifier \u2022 *97% of moms say a Tommee Tippee pacifier helped settle baby \u2022 *93% of moms say babies love their Tommee Tippee pacifier \u2022 97.5% of babies accept a Tommee Tippee pacifier Warning! Do not tie pacifier around child\u2019s neck as it presents a strangulation danger.",

They absolutely are lightweight and don't cause my baby to strain to hold them in or use their hands. Also made for easy nights as they didn't fall out as soon as they drifted off to sleep. They are quite durable and easy to clean. No tough creases or holes, no risk of the tips falling off as it is all one piece.",

They are so lightweight and easy to clean since they are one solid piece of silicone! I would highly recommend these to anyone with a breastfed baby or anyone whose baby struggles to keep a pacifier in!",

The angle makes it so it\u2019s harder to fall out of their mouth like some we tried, making them perfect for little babies who can\u2019t put the binky in by themselves yet. We spend a lot less time popping it back into his mouth than any other brand we tried. They soothe him instantly. I would definitely recommend trying these before wasting money on any other type of pacifier.",
