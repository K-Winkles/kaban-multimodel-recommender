The colors are muted, which I love, and the texture on the nipple seems to keep my daughter happy with them. My only negative remark is I\u2019m not a huge fan of the shape of the handle. I typically always have a binky clip attached, and the attachment loop always moves up towards the sides of the handle since it narrows at the top and widens at the bottom. Doesn\u2019t make the pacifier unusable, just a little awkward figuring out which way is top or bottom.",
