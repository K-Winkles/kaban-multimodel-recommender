        "description": "Philips Avent ultra soft pacifier is a soft, flexible pacifier for babies aged 0-6 months old. It allows you to soothe your baby even if they have sensitive skin. Our super soft* and flexible shield follows the curves of your baby's cheeks, leaving fewer skin marks and less skin irritation. The Philips Avent ultra soft pacifier features a safety pull ring and is available in various colors and designs. The orthodontic and BPA-free pacifier set comes with an ultra soft travel case that doubles up as a sterilizer, so all you need to do is add some water and pop it in the microwave. Then rest easy so that it's clean for the next use. When we asked moms how their little ones respond to our textured silicone nipples, on average 98%* said that their baby accepts Philips Avent ultra soft and ultra air pacifiers. Everything about the ultra soft pacifier is designed to feel soft, including the silky nipple. Making it easy for your baby to latch on and get accustomed quickly. We also focus on your baby's healthy oral development with a symmetrical nipple that respects the natural shape of their palate, teeth and gums. *2016-2017 US consumer tests show an average of 98% nipple acceptance of the textured Philips Avent nipple used in our ultra air and ultra soft soothers. **For hygiene reasons, replace pacifiers after 4 weeks of use.",
