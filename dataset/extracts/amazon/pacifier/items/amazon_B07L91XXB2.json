Like all NUK pacifiers, the Value Pack features the improved NUK orthodontic nipple shape. Invented over 60 years ago by pediatric dentists and doctors, the NUK pacifier is modeled after the natural shape of mom's nipple while breastfeeding. This makes for an easy transition from breast to pacifier and back. The asymmetrical nipple naturally fits baby's palate and is now improved to allow for more room for a natural sucking motion, reduce pressure on teeth and jaw, and helps prevent teeth misalignment. The NUK heart-shaped shield fits perfectly under baby's nose for easier breathing and prevents irritation. With a convenient glow-in-the-dark feature to help you find lost a pacifier during the night, this pack of 3 orthodontic pacifiers is ideal for your child aged 6-18 months. (Based on Market Research, 2017, tested with 307 pacifier users)",
