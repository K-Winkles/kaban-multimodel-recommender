The dog has been very durable after a 7 months-including the paci.I chose the Fox because 1 . It's adorable and 2. The placement of where the paci attaches is the same as the dog (and other Wubbanubs available). I have read reviews on a few other Wubbanub animals where the paci attaches on a different part of the animals mouth and the hold is not as secure.TIP: For a quick clean, I sterilize the paci part every other day by running it under hot water and hand washing with soap. The mouth area on the animal does get a little damp, but it dries quickly. For a thorough wash (including the animal) throw it in the wash with a load of baby's laundry! You can also hand wash the whole thing with hot soapy water.These Wubbanubs are so sweet and your little one will love exploring the animal part while finding comfort in having their paci and a plushie in one!",

                "reviewText": "This is our fourth purchase of Wubbanub products. We were first introduced to this cute little guy at the hospital where our son was born, and he was instantly in love. Or maybe we were. The product is well crafted, with seemingly high-quality materials, and has stood up to the test of time and the abuse only an infant-transitioning-to-toddler can inflict. The added weight of the little animal helps naturally orient the pacifier correctly in our son's mouth, and when he drops it it's so much easier to spot among the toys or blankets (or grass or whatever!), meaning we've never lost one. The only reason we've had to buy more is the rubber pacifier eventually will tear off at the place it is sewn to the stuffed animal. We accept that as normal wear-and-tear, and are overall very happy with these.",

Even if she throws it, it is an easy find. One day we left foxy at home by mistake and it was torture. I have backup hushies in her bag and we went through all three of them in no time. They were the same brand hushie, just with the fox not attached. She threw them, dropped them, and spit them out. I didn't realize how easy we had it. A must have baby accessory! A plus is that this fox is in so many of her baby pictures, so it is great that it is actually adorable! You can tell how much she loves him :)",

                "reviewText": "This is a brilliant product!We introduced our son to pacifiers at 2 months and quickly found he (like alot of babies) would drop and lose his pacifier. We did not like the idea of getting a pacifier leash so we did a bit of looking and found wannanub.When you get one though go ahead and buy two (we bought different animals so he would not get fixated on one.) The reason I suggest buying two is: (1) you always have the possibly of losing one (sorry foxy, we didn't mean to lose you) and (2) you can wash them with your baby's clothes on gentle.After a year the pacifiers became worn, but you can buy the avent pacifiers 2 pack and replace it for a couple bucks. (I'm a decent seamstress, but you don't need to be, just cut the threads where the pacifier is sewn in, pull out the old pacifier, put the new one in, and use a thimble with a thick needle to get nice tight stiches. If you don't have the strenght you can use a husband with pliers.)The best part about this product is I found our son is weaning himself off of it much quicker than some of my friend's children and ALL BY HIMSELF! He is 16 months and rarely used the pacifier part of the wannanub. I recently removed the pacifier on both of his wannanubs and sewed them up and they just turned into nap stuffies. He did ge a bit upset, but there was no huge fuss like I've seen in the past and he did suck on the feet the first two nights, but stopped that on his own and now just snuggles with them.I was never a fan of pacifiers because I hated how fixated some toddlers become. Wannanub has made a great product that allows newborns the ability to grab their own pacifiers and cuddle buddies, babies the ability to easily carry and put down their pacifiers for an easier ability to crawl and learn, and a great method for toddlers to transition away from their pacifiers.I plan to add this product to all my baby shower gifts!",

                "reviewText": "My baby (and I) LOVE this thing! My baby is definitely a comfort sucker. She was a big fan of the soothie pacifier as a newborn, but it kept falling out of her mouth. The stuffed animal provides more support and keeps this thing pretty snug in my baby's mouth, even if she stops sucking for a moment. My baby just turned two months and is able to hug the fox to help keep it in place and is able to search for and recognize it as well. If in the event it does fall out, or my baby knocks it out, with the bulk of the stuffed animal, I am able to quickly find the pacifier if it falls into a blanket or a car seat and pop the thing right back into her mouth.",

                "reviewText": "We ordered one to try to keep it in the baby's mouth easier. It was a little stiff the first day or two but I found if I lay the fox on his back it got a good angle. Then he softened up and works great. The cats chewed the nipple off the first one and I immediately ordered 2 more as we struggled through the 2 day shipping with a normal pacy.Now they are both soft and I flip fox from belly to back depending on the right angle but most often little man just grabs him and shoves him in his own mouth. We actually give him one and put the other on the baby's belly so if he accidentally tosses one he can find the other one right away at night. It's wonderful. I have another baby on the way and just ordered the octopus so hopefully that will be just as wonderful.",
