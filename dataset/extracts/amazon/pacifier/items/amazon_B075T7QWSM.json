I also appreciate that they are clear so they look like they belong and not a weird add on adapter. I would for sure recommend these to a friend, as mam pacifiers are the best, and this opens possibilities for the cute paci clips. I just wish this was a 2 pack, not sure why I need for than that lol.",

My other ones I got from somewhere else had the ability to move in circles around the paci so the baby could have more motion with it. That\u2019s the only thing I don\u2019t like about these. They are flexible so it\u2019s easy to get on and off for parents. Just hard enough to keep baby from getting off. Easy to clean And they have a good thickness. They are just kind of sticky which comes with the silicone which is why they don\u2019t spin.",
