The \u201chandle\u201d makes using a paci clip easy & away from baby\u2019s mouth.Nipple design is Nuk, but the overall look of the paci is more along the Mam design.",

My baby boy loves these.The ONLY reason for 4 stars and downside to these is that the design starts to fade away after such a short period of time but it\u2019s really not that big of a deal to me. I use them for the purpose and not the Disney design. But if they would last longer that would be a bonus.",
