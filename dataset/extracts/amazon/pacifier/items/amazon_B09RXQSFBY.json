            "\ud83d\ude0aCalm Down & Reduce Snoring: Two of the great benefits of using a pacifier are that a pacifier can help calm you down and relax you. Plus, if used when going to sleep, it may help you achieve a deeper, more restful night of sleep as it reduces snoring by keeping the tongue in the proper place in the mouth during sleep. It also encourages nasal breathing which has been shown to deliver more oxygen to the lungs and help with achieving quality sleep."

My GF hasn't sucked her thumb since she got her pacifier and I have spares now, one I clip to my sheet for sleeping, and another just in case I need it (my original one is clipped to my daily onesie).",

I was able to put it back together, but I have to be gentle with it, cuz if I\u2019m rough the back will pop off. None of the other ones broke, cuz now I know not to tug them really hard.
