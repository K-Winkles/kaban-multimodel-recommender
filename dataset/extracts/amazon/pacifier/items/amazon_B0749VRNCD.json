With a 60% thinner neck and 4 times more flexible nipple** than a regular pacifier, you can be assured that your little one\u2019s favorite binky is safe for their development as it puts less pressure on their jaw and teeth. MAM\u2019s medically engineered nipples feature life-like, SkinSoft textured silicone that feels more natural, just like mom. With multiple nipple and shield sizes to pick from, MAM nipples are easily accepted by babies of all ages, with 94% nipple acceptance among babies tested***. Babies simply love the ease and comfort of latching onto MAM nipples. Sterilize baby\u2019s MAM pacifier in the microwave using the convenient MAM self-sterilizing storage case. Microwave disinfection is proven effective in killing common household germs and bacteria. Pacifiers kept in the closed box will remain disinfected for up to 48 hours: Fill baby pacifier case with water. Place pacifier in the pacifier case with the nipple facing down. Follow pacifier package instructions for microwave setting. Cool completely before use. *Y. Wagner, R.

(Between: 32% \u2013 83% thinner / 1.1 \u2013 19.5 times more flexible than regular silicone pacifiers). *** Market Research 2009-2017, tested with 1,508 babies. Please avoid leaving the pacifier in the sterilising solution for longer than the time recommended. Sometimes water may enter the inside of the nipple, this is because of a ventilation systems that exists in the nipple and helps make the pacifier orthodontic.",

This type has a different nipple shape then the regular MAM pacifiers and our son does not like them as much as the regular shape ones. Over all they are a good pacifier and that\u2019s why I gave it 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "I'd first like to say that up until yesterday, I absolutely loved these binkys. They are the only brand my son has liked since he was born. A couple months ago I read somewhere that babies who use a binky that is too small for them can inhale it and choke, so I bought a few sets of these as they are 0-6 months and he was still using newborn size. Yesterday, I put my son down for a nap with his binky in his mouth, as I always do. He is currently 5 months. I sat down in my office next to his room and immediately started hearing a strange crying noise, and I could see on the baby monitor that my son's hand was in his mouth. I ran into his room and he had this binky completely sideways stuck in his mouth trying to get it out. I had to pull it out of his mouth, probably hurting the roof of his mouth, and he was just screaming. He is fine, but it was a very scary experience. Unfortunately, I no longer feel comfortable allowing him to sleep with these binkys. Other than this experience they have been really great, but please be careful with your little ones when unsupervised!!",
