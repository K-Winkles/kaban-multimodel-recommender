                "reviewText": "I just received my Littleforbig pacifiers in the mail after impatiently waiting for them, since I've been wanting to get adult pacifiers for a few months now after using ones meant for 16+ months. The nipples are the right size for my mouth and are nice to suck on, and the shields look great on me. This is so much better than using 16+ month pacifiers! I love the assortment of colors in this three pack, and a pretty big deciding factor for me choosing to get these specific pacifiers were the protective caps, which are rare to find included even with baby pacifiers. The caps snap on perfectly, and the plastic used for the pacifiers is smooth and nice. It does say \"littleforbig.com\" on both the shield and handle, which I wasn't aware of, but it's small enough that you can only see it if you look up close, so I don't really mind. The only thing that kind of disappointed me was the fact that the purple one has some dirt on the side, and the pink one is a little scratched up on the button. I'd give these 4.5 stars if I could because of this. It isn't really noticeable though, but I thought I'd mention it for any of the perfectionists out there. Hopefully I'll be able to clean the dirt off. Aside from that, I'm really pleased with this purchase. I'll definitely be buying more of these when I need them! I definitely recommend these pacifiers for anyone out there who is little, likes to stim (this is a good alternative to chewy necklaces, which don't work well for me), or both.",

                "reviewText": "IntroLet me first start off about myself: I am autistic and I found that I concentrate better while having something in my mouth. Pen caps don't work for me and neither does gum. I have to have something to fiddle with while my hands are free. Chewing something never does anything for me. I began with a latex Nuk5 back in 2012 and then got a NLT7 from Pacifiers R Us in 2013. They are great, but expensive. I wanted to give the Little For Big a try due to the YouTube reviews. Also wanted something cheap in case it gets taken away for some odd reason. I am a College student. I keep mine in a pacifier cradle.The little for big Pacifier.The teat on these are great. The silicon teat is very sturdy and won't tear when you pull on it. I also love the extra silicon in the sides of the bulb. I found this aspect very appealing when I saw the YouTube vids. The relief that I get from my anxiety using these is amazing. I tend to squeeze my pacifier in my mouth without thinking about it when I am sad or stressed out. Lastly I found that disassembling these was fairly easy. You have to pull the clip on both sides of the button carefully and then pull up against the shield. I switched the guards out for Mam pacifier shields. The guards are a bit too big..Pros-Very sturdy silicon (Will not break)-Extra in the sides for comfort (Excellent for squeezing)-Almost as good as Pacifiers R Us (Great price for the Quality).Cons-Shields are big and almost flat (They don't fit to my face)-Shield plastic seems cheap (You get what you pay for)-There is a small rough edge at the end of the teat (Not too bad)",

I have no medical or psychological training . I have been involved with local resource centers and have offered my time in the past.I have seen the dark side of things and will say no more.There is nothing wrong with being a little or feeling the need to regress for self-care . We have crossed over the worst of last year and are hopefully see some light at the end of a very long tunnel.If there is anything I have learned over the years it is human connection is essential for emotional stability . When that foundation is ripped away we can feel lost a vulnerable .No harm can ever come from using any means necessary to help alleviate the pain and discomfort that come with emotion distress .Any \u2018 real \u2018 and caring doctor or psychologist well tell you regression is a normal process of self care and awareness often used to help \u2018 ground \u2018 emotional needs of anyone in crisis.These are just one of many tools to help anyone feel just a little bit better , and sometimes , a little bit is all it takes .The only one thing I have asked the seller is to find out if there is a possibility of a teat with a longer stem and a slightly larger nipple .I received a reply stating they would take it under advisement , I can only hope they do.In the mean time , I will be buying more of there products.The time has come to start caring for ourselves and if we can help others , then life is great !!Dreamer",
