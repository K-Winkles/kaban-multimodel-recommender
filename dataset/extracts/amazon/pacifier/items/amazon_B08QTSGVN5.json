                "reviewText": "My baby started on MAM pacifiers which worked great, until I needed to move him to the next size up. The mouth piece was too large for his mouth and a different, more bulb-like shape. He suddenly stopped taking the pacifier, which is a must for him to fall asleep.I saw ads for the Medela pacifier and I figured I\u2019d see how he responded to that mouth piece since it looked more like the 0-6 MAM. He took right to it! The handle on the pacifier is also helpful because he has an easier time grasping it to get it in his mouth.My favorite part tho is how easy it is to connect to a pacifier clip. The MAM I had to thread through the side, which the loop of the clip that attached to the pacifier, pressed against his face. This loops so easily through the handle of the day pacifier and even the nub of the night pacifier has a hole to loop the clip through.The pacifier has a case that covers the mouth piece which is good for throwing in the diaper bag.The design on this is really cute and and it\u2019s much nicer quality, the design does not appear like it will wear off like most decorative pacifiers.Sooo happy to find pacifier for my LO age that he happily took to.",
