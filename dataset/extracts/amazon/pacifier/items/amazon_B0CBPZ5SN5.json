                "reviewText": "I ordered these and Frigg pacifiers at the same time to try. These are easier to clean and don\u2019t get water trapped inside, the nipple is softer and more easily accepted by my EBF baby, and nearly half the cost. I thought they would be too heavy because they\u2019re fully silicone and not partly made of plastic but they\u2019re actually still very lightweight. My baby doesn\u2019t love pacifiers in general but we\u2019re trying out different brands and shapes and she actually took this one for a bit which is saying something. She will gag on other bulb pacifiers because they\u2019re too long but these are appropriately sized for smaller babies. I honestly don\u2019t even think I would have noticed the seam if others hadn\u2019t mentioned it here. There is only one other pacifier she took as easily as this one (Tommee Tippee Ultralight) but it didn\u2019t have a spot for a pacifier clip and didn\u2019t come in cute colors. I hope she ends up liking these because they\u2019re so cute and have the features I\u2019m looking for!",

                "reviewText": "I recently learned that most pacifier brands market themselves as \u201c100% natural rubber\u201d but are made of latex, which can be harmful to your little ones since they can develop a latex allergy due to constant exposure to latex! So I\u2019m so thankful I found some 100% silicon pacifiers! My daughter took to them so quickly & they are so beyond easy to clean",

                "reviewText": "Baby took to it right away!I have a 5 month old foster baby who has had issues with maintaining a latch on a bottle or pacifier. I was able to get her to take the rubber bulb shaped pacifiers but they degrade quickly and are much more expensive than these silicone ones. I had been trying to find one that's similar to those but all silicone which this one is. I also LOVE that the shield faces away from the baby's face which supports healthy skin and keeps their airway clear. She seems to be able to hold this one better and it's cute with the flower shape. The nipple isn't as smooth as most silicone pacifiers which for her is great as I think thats why she prefers the rubber ones - they're more skin like.I took off one star because the handle doesn't pivot to lay flat, which I do like that about the rubber ones as baby likes to snuggle her face into me, or the crib. I also wonder about the slight space between the nipple and the shield and if that's going to get gross. I put her binkys in the dishwasher daily. Will update later if that becomes a further issue.",

                "reviewText": "I have a picky, tongue tied, exclusively BF baby... bibs is all she has been willing to take so far, but they are expensive so I thought we'd give these a try. This product has the same shape and feel as bibs, but easier to keep clean! No hidden crevices for mold to grow in is a HUGE plus. My only complaint is that the nipple has a more prominent seam where the mold comes together. I was worried that would be a deal breaker for my picky baby but she doesn't seem to mind. She takes it just the same as the bibs.",

She was being pretty aggressive and managed to rip the nipple completely in half. At this point we\u2019d only had them a couple weeks and because I bought 4, they weren\u2019t weakened from a lot of use as she was switching between them. I think we\u2019ll stick to our tried and true Tommee Tippees from now on. Much thicker, sturdier silicone. Two kids worth of pacis and not a one has ever ripped like that.",
