                "reviewText": "This brand and shape of binky has been the only one my now 7 month old will take! I received the first round I had as a gift, and ended up ordering more when the others were worn out.I usually try not to use binkys with my children as I prefer life without them for a number of reasons. However, my youngest son has been quite different from my first and he has needed that extra tool for calming.I appreciate that this binky is so lightweight, unlike a lot that are way too heavy to be held in a baby\u2019s mouth. This one seems much more \u201csafe\u201d in that regard. I do believe that the shape of this binky is why my son likes it and can hold it in his mouth- he has a higher palate and a tongue tie so other binkies are hard to hold.Usually they recommend against binkies for tongue tied babies, but I believe in moderation and I do try to remove the binky when he\u2019s asleep so that he maintains appropriate mouth posture and tongue position.Like other reviews have mentioned, I was surprised when I opened the new binkies I ordered and they seemed much smaller than the old and very used one we were replacing. But that was because the older one got so stretched out and soft because of the material, that it actually got bigger. I was worried my son wouldn\u2019t take to the new ones. Although he seemed disinterested at first, he did finally take to them after a couple days of practice.I also love the look of these, even though that would be the last on my list of reasons for buying a binky. It doesn\u2019t hurt that they are cute and super simple, and come in great color combos.Thankful for these binkies for baby\u2019s like this one!",

I have not had a chance to use them as my baby hasn't been born yet however they came packaged perfectly and everything looks great. I saw someone say they were a bit large but to me they are pretty small and a lot smaller than the Ryan and Rose sets, which is why I went with them.",

I would give them 5 stars but I feel like they stretch out a little sooner than the other brands that have this a similar product, but still last within the recommended replacement time and a good value! Great buy other than that!",
