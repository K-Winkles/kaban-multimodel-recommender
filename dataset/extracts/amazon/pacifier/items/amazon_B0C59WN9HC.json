        "description": "Philips Avent ultra air pacifier is a breathable pacifier for babies aged 6-18 months old. It comes with extra-large air holes that let your baby's skin breathe, meaning the skin remains dry. The orthodontic and BPA-free pacifier set comes with a travel case that doubles up as a sterilizer, so all you need to do is add some water and pop it in the microwave. Then rest easy so that it's clean for the next use. When we asked moms how their little ones respond to our textured silicone nipples, on average 98%* said that their baby accepts Philips Avent ultra soft and ultra air pacifiers. Everything about the ultra air pacifier is designed to feel comfortable, including the silky nipple. Making it easy for your baby to latch on and get accustomed quickly. We also focus on your baby's healthy oral development with a symmetrical nipple that respects the natural shape of their palate, teeth and gums. *2016-2017 US consumer tests show an average of 98% nipple acceptance of the textured Philips Avent nipple used in our ultra air and ultra soft soothers. **For hygiene reasons, replace pacifiers after 4 weeks of use",

We love that they have openings around the lips/cheeks so that excess drool was never trapped under it and never caused any rash or skin irritation. Orthodontically speaking, these binkies are a great shape and did not interfere with incoming teeth or palate shape. They come in several sizes to grow with your child. Love the little handle so we could use a binky clip easily to prevent it from dropping on the ground. Also, how cute are the colors and designs?! These will always be my go to for my babies!
