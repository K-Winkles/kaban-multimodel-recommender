        "description": "Keep baby calm with a binky that you will both love. The MAM Animal Collection Pacifier was developed by leading pediatric dentists and developmental psychologists to provide maximum comfort and style for babies from birth to six months.* MAM pacifiers for babies feature an innovative nipple designed to promote healthy oral development so you can soothe your baby with confidence. Baby will love latching onto the soothing pacifier nipple that, with the help of a built-in air channel, naturally flattens and extends when sucked, mimicking a human nipple during breastfeeding. And all MAM pacifiers are orthodontic, featuring a symmetrical nipple that fits perfectly in baby's mouth at any angle. MAM's medically engineered nipples all feature life-like, SkinSoft textured silicone that feels more natural, just like mom. With multiple pacifier shapes and shield sizes to pick from, MAM nipples are easily accepted by babies of all ages, with 94% nipple acceptance among babies tested.** Babies simply love the ease and comfort of latching onto MAM nipples. Plus, the sterilizing storage case makes it easy to keep baby safe from germs with fast, easy cleaning right in the box. Microwave disinfection is proven effective in killing common household germs and bacteria. Pacifiers kept in the closed box will remain disinfected for up to 48 hours: Fill pacifier case with water. Place pacifier in the pacifier case with the nipple facing down. Follow pacifier package instructions for microwave setting. Cool completely before use. *Developed with the International Children's Medical Research Society. ** Market Research 2009-2017, tested with 1,508 babies.",

We were constantly playing the pacifier dance going in to put it back in to try and extend her naps. I researched best pacifiers and read this one has a non-slip style. It's honestly not my style but it works SO well! It stays in unless she intentionally spits it out, and I couldn't believe when I watched her on her baby monitor and it was still in her mouth 45 minutes in. We couldn't get past that 45 minute mark with her because that's the end of a sleep cycle and she'd wake up crying. This stays in great and has helped extend her naps! I ordered several more because my husband was so impressed with it. It's only ended up out of her mouth a few times in the crib and that's when she really makes an effort to spit it out, not just slipping or falling out like the others did!",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this type & brand of pacifiers! Bought these so we could have a couple more and because it included the self sterilizing case, which can also be used for just a traveling case to take the pacifiers with you without need to purchase a pacifier case (which is like $10 so it saves money!)These pacifiers are a lot cuter in person than just as pictures, I love how fast & easy it is to sterilize the pacifiers without needing to boil water and sterilizing it that way as it takes longer, only downfall is you can sterilize just 2 at a time in the case compared being able to do more in a pot but that\u2019s okay! Super easy and convenient! Love it!",

                "reviewText": "So, before I had kids I was like...I won't use a pacifier until I absolutely have to. And then, my child was like...five days old, and she was sucking on a MAM pacifier. These are really a fantastic choice for pacifiers - my child took to them immediately, and refuses really any other type of pacifier. We've had no issues with any \"nipple confusion\" that I was warned about ad nauseam. These are also approved by whoever the boss of all the dentists is and won't impede her oral development, so it's nice not having to worry about switching at a later point. I also really like these because they come with a sterilizing box. This box is a quick and easy way to not only store the pacifiers but also to sanitize in a pinch. I tried to sanitize using the instapot, and found that this melted the plastic in parts - no bueno. We have purchased many, many, many of these and are always happy.",

I love the little carrying case these come in and the design of the pacifiers are so cute.In terms of washing- the nipple can get water inside of it but it squeezes out easily and I sanitize them daily. I've had no issues with mold or anything gross.",

                "reviewText": "These worked for us. No weird color leaching. I wanted my baby to use single peice latex pacifiers, but he had other ideas. I finally tried these and he loved them. The penguin and lion design and very cute and gender neutral. My only gripe is that you have to be really careful to rinse the soap off of them really well. It gets into the nipple and when you squeeze it after sometimes soap bubbles form around the mouth wings between the nipple and the button on the outside. Squeezing it out under hot water helps rinse all the soap out and then shake it good before air drying. Alternatively, just boil them to clean them, but how often are you able to do that when you drop one.",
