He's still not obsessed with these, but instead of immediately spitting them out he actually grabs the handle and holds it in his mouth - sometimes he still ends up pulling it out, but since he can control the pacifier himself he seems to like it more than others we have tried. i like that he can get his tiny 4 month old hands around the handle and I hope that these grow on him the more we offer them to him.",

The colors are pretty muted which seems like the current style and these Nuby Silicone Softees Pacifier & Teether, 5 pk, Neutral are made out of silicone which I really like. He latches on these pretty well, they are soft and they work great for him. Of course every baby is different so your results may differ but overall happy with these and would get again.On a side note, I find it funny we had a bunch of elaborate pacifiers on the market with our middle children and we now have come full circle back to the basic pacifier that is really similar to the standard one you likely got when your child was born. It is funny how that works.",

Also, I like that it is easy to attach a pacifier clip to these because the handle sticks out quite a bit. On some of the other pacifiers (like the Avent soothee), it can be hard to attach a clip and when you do, the cord is pressed up against the baby's face and can leave a mark. There is no problem of that with these pacifiers.I like that they are one piece and that water can't get trapped inside when cleaning them. They are very easy to clean and sterilize.There is a nice variety of colors in this set, including brights and more subdued colors. They are packaged in a \"giftable\" pouch.",
