Our night time pacifiers feature ingenious glow in the dark handles, so parents can locate the pacifier in a dark room without having to disturb baby.As the symmetrical silicone baglet is fully reversible, there is no wrong side-up so the pacifier will always be placed correctly in your babys mouth, even when they put it in their mouth themselves. The curved shield sits comfortably between babys chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect babys delicate skin against irritation.The BPA-free silicone nipple is soft and flexible whilst also being robust and durable. The smooth surface of silicone is very easy to clean and wont absorb stains and odors. Simply pop in a sterilizer, wash by hand or in the dishwasher. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months.*From an independent study in July 2021 of 416 moms with a 0-36m child, who are currently using a Tommee Tippee pacifier: *99% of moms would recommend a Tommee Tippee pacifier *97% of moms say a Tommee Tippee pacifier helped settle baby *93% of moms say babies love their Tommee Tippee pacifier *97.5% of babies accept a Tommee Tippee pacifierWarning!

                "reviewText": "So it took us a solid 9 months to find pacifiers my kid liked consistently. When we could no longer find the ones she liked in stock without ordering online, we gave these a shot! She took to them instantly and now we have about 15 of them scattered across the house and car in various sizes because she\u2019s picky. She took to them as soon as I gave them to her and now she carries them everywhere, even when they aren\u2019t in her mouth. My only real complaint is that the 6-18 month size don\u2019t have the nose opening on both the top and bottom like the 18-36 do because she sometimes likes to randomly pop them in and gets poked in the nose with the 6-18 if they aren\u2019t facing the right direction. Other than that, they\u2019ve been an absolute lifesaver. The nipple does seem to hold up pretty well since she\u2019s now 13 months and cutting molars and canines and CHEWING constantly on them. She\u2019s only managed to bite through one and that one was one of the first we bought that was worn out anyways. They\u2019re really lightweight and don\u2019t cause issues if she falls asleep with it in her mouth, it doesn\u2019t fall out until she pushes it out. Plus with them having the handle, almost every pacifier clip we\u2019ve tried has been able to work for them. I\u2019ve gifted them to a few people with newborns and babies a few months old as well and all but one of the kids took to them. 10/10 would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Perfect for my little guy. He likes them for comfort when he hurts himself and for co.fort as he's falling asleep. The glow-in-the-dark feature is a game changer! He is now 1 yo, but he's been using these since he was 8 months old. It helps him sleep through the night since he can easily find these in the dark in his crib. He also tries to bite these during the morning/ daytime episodes, but they are very durable. He hasn't even been able to dent one or cut the nipple on one, and he has at least 11 teeth. I like that he can use it as both a paci and as a teething toy.",

                "reviewText": "My son doesn't usually take a pacifier, he's completely happy without one. We used the \"soothie\" ones at first, but he would spit them out in his sleep. We tried these ones for bedtime, and they work very well-- the end of the bulb is a bit flared, so it tends to stay in his mouth, even when he's asleep. We've now got a very good sleep association going: stick one in his mouth and rock him for a few, and he's out like a light. Bonus points for a reduction in SIDS risk!The handles glow in the dark, but you need to remember to leave them in the light. When we leave them in his room with blackout curtains, they don't get any light and don't glow at night. If we bring them into the living room for about twenty minutes, though, they glow very nicely.We've got blue and teal ones from the baby store in town, but when we ordered we received ones that were green and black. Very stylish!",
