        "description": "Product Description Finally, a pacifier that soothes babies and parents too! The PhysioForma Soft Silicone Orthodontic Pacifier is a 100% silicone one-piece pacifier that isn't just for pacifying, but is also clinically developed for comfort, breathing and orthodontic benefits. An exclusive nipple design helps position baby\u2019s tongue forward to maintain an open airway, which supports physiological breathing. Physiological breathing is especially important during sleep. It improves quality of sleep and reduces irritability - better for baby & you! The unique angle and lateral curve of the nipple evenly distribute tongue pressure across baby's palate. Tiny ridges and an inclined nipple shape guide proper tongue placement. Together, these important features support baby's growing palate and teeth.For baby\u2019s comfort, the nipple is made from extra-soft silicone with a satin-textured finish to help keep the paci in baby\u2019s mouth for uninterrupted soothing. Multiple ventilation holes promote air circulation and help reduce moisture buildup on baby\u2019s soft, sensitive skin. Plus, there's an easy-to-grab handle for either baby or parent to hold. The PhysioForma exclusive nipple design was developed, tested, and approved in partnership with an advisory panel of leading neonatologists, pediatricians, and orthodontists. The one-piece Soft Silicone pacifiers also adhere to the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics and are accepted by 9 out of 10 babies. Available in three sizes: 0-6m, 6-16m, and 16-24m. Reusable, sterilizing/carry case included. Brand Story By Chicco",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. These pacifiers are wonderful. I absolutely love them. Who loves them even more? My (nearly) 6 months old son.It was immediate. It's a great size for his mouth, which made it easy for him to get comfortable. It's soft all over; He enjoys taking it out of his mouth and adjusting it, so that he can chew it from any angle.I don't have to worry about it wearing anytime soon. Not only did I order 2 packs of 2 pacifiers, but it also has a decent thickness to it. I personally purchased the clear ones, but I will be getting the blue and green soon for a bit of variety.As for the shape, my only wish is that it was a bit more rounded at the top, because I feel like when pacifiers are shaped valley in the middle, the peaks tend to push the nostrils up. Luckily, this one does have a little bit of space. It doesn't curve on to his mouth. If that makes sense?Another thing that I like is the loop at the back of the pacifier that allows you to hook on a clip. I had another brand that does silicone pacifiers, and there wasn't anything to attach the clip to. As you can see, I have the ali+oli linen pacifier clips, and it works out perfectly.Overall, I am completely satisfied with this purchase, and I would recommend it to every mom.",

                "reviewText": "I started with the 0-2 months pacifier, my son is almost 4 months old so I decided to order the blue pacifier which is made for 6-16 months. I didn\u2019t think it would be a problem considering he would grow into it, but unfortunately the blue pacifier is too big for his mouth and when he\u2019s not actively sucking him, the pacifier will make him gag. So I ordered the 2-6 months and a bit confused/disappointed. The 2-6 months pacifier appears to be the same size as the 0-2 months one but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s actually smaller and the nipple is shorter. I tried my best to show that in the pictures. Not happy with this dilemma because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good to give my son a smaller nipple even if it\u2019s it not that much smaller. Anyway, these will just be backups until he grows into the blue ones! Also I don\u2019t like the texture of the blue ones, they are much stickier and basically a lint roller! Every little fiber of lint sticks to it and does not fall off, it\u2019s needs to be washed! Ugh!",
