They are a nice light weight so it\u2019s not pulling on their mouth. They\u2019re durable (I\u2019m not worried about the nipple coming off and becoming a choking hazard) and well made. The plastic part is slightly bowed so it doesn\u2019t lay flat against the face which I like both for better representing a breast (good sucking technique) and because it means it\u2019s not pressed against her nose. They are east to clean and made of a nice soft rubber. Plus, they\u2019re cute!",

I bought these pacifiers on a whim when I saw they were discounted as a last ditch effort, but our baby actually loves them! Saves me from hours of being her pacifier like I had been doing before when she was full but still needed to suck for soothing. Plus they're super cute!Only thing that could become a negative is I noticed after sanitizing in boiling water that the bulb does fill with some water. It squeezed out easily, but I'm keeping an eye out for mold growth in there. So far no issues though!",

When he started teething, he started with a rash around his mouth due to the trapped moisture so I switched over to this one. We both love it now!

                "reviewText": "So my son is 4 months currently and this is the only binky he\u2019ll take and LOVES it. That being said I bought multiple, however, once worn in a bit the nipple expands a ton!! Which is fine but my issue now is he will only take that one binky he\u2019s worn in lol I\u2019ve tried to give him another of the same kind but it\u2019s just not the soft expanded one he\u2019s come to love. Another mom I know said the same thing happened with her baby too! So although it\u2019s a great binky and my son loves it, it\u2019s odd that the nipple expands so much and therefore isn\u2019t like the rest making it hard to go between different ones (again of the same kind). I\u2019ve also tried stretching them myself and soaking them in hot water to see if I could mimic his favorite one but it didn\u2019t work, he just needs to break in the others which I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll care to do. Lastly, it\u2019s easy to clean but gets water trapped inside the nipple which stinks but it dries out pretty quickly!",
