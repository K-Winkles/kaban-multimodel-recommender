                "reviewText": "My little spent 100+ days in the NICU where she became quite attached to her green/teal soothie. However, she was never able to fully keep it in her mouth unassisted which would make for a middle of the night fussy babe, a dirty soothie from its roll on the floor, and a tired/frustrated momma. After months of trying different options because I really wanted to be able to attach it to a clip of sorts (soothies have a solid handle making this impossible without poking a hole through it), I just wasn\u2019t having any luck. All other silicone options we tried were too bulky, heavy, or wasn\u2019t just one piece which trapped water/germs. But, I came across this one and gave it a shot. Needless to say, I have been pleased so far! It\u2019s about the same weight as her NICU soothie, but with a curve that helps it to sit more snug on the contour of her face which makes for less falling out. It\u2019s all one piece, so no germs or trapped water, but it has a handle which allows for attaching a clip without issue. And, the color is a frosted clear so it goes with anything - looks super cute with her boho wooden clip! I haven\u2019t had it long, so I haven\u2019t noticed any color change from use, but will update.**UPDATE: This one is still going strong a year later! No rips or tears, and no yellowing (which is a HUGE plus)!! The only gripe I have is that it's friggen clear... so, I definitely have a love-hate relationship with this pacifier. I LOVE that it's clear because it goes with everything (Yeah, I match outfits to paci's *shrug*), but oh boy, don't let your little walk away with it or drop it in the bed somewhere without a clip or other attachment because it'll be an eternity before you find it again!Now... I just have to find a way to wean my little one off of this thing...",

                "reviewText": "1. These are clear, which is so cool because you can see your baby sucking on them. They can sometimes be a little hard to see/find if you don\u2019t have a pacifier clip on them.2. The loop is perfect for attaching pacifier clips, which we LOVE. This has saved so many pacifiers from being thrown out of the stroller, car seat, you name it. They stay cleaner for longer. The loop is a great feature, and I prefer Evenflo over Phillips Avent because of it.3. They\u2019re small and soft, which my baby prefers. These were one of the first pacifiers she would take without gagging or spitting it out right away. When she was a newborn the only ones we found that seemed small enough for her to tolerate were Nanobebe.4. These pacifiers are such a great price! So you can buy more of them, haha! We bought a bunch of them to scatter around the crib, stock the diaper bag, and clip onto everything. We don\u2019t go anywhere without an Evenflo pacifier on standby.",

Highly suggest getting a paci holder to place on it when it\u2019s not in child\u2019s mouth. It can disappear on you due to the clear color, we have over looked it multiple times when not in use.",

In the beginning when he was a newborn he didn\u2019t really like it I\u2019m guessing because the size itself was too big for his little mouth. But that depends baby to baby every baby is different. Once my little one turned 5 weeks this is the only pacifier he takes up to this date, his now 4 months and still loves it !! I\u2019m definitely going to purchase stage 2 of this even Flo pacifier",
