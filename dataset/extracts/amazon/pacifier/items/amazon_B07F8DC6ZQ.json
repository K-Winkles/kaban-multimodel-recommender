        "description": "This is a 3 pack of rounded 0 to 6 months pacifiers. Ecopiggy Ecopacifier is the preferred natural rubber pacifier. Sustainably made from 100% natural rubber, from the tree Hevea Brasiliensis, ecopacifier is softer and more natural than artificial silicone. Our round shield lightly touches the child's nose, simulating the soothing feel of breast feeding. Ecopacifier's single-piece design ensures no small pieces to gather dirt and germs, and no small pieces means no choking hazards. Ecopiggy natural rubber pacifiers are made without chemical softeners or colorants, and are BPA-Free, Phthalate-Free, PVC-Free, and Paraben-Free. Children love the natural soothing effects of Ecopacifier, offered in two styles; Orthodontic and Rounded. Due to the soft quality of Ecopacifier, our natural rubber pacifier will not leave marks on your child's face. Child happy. Parents happy. Ecopiggy's Natural Pacifier, Ecopacifier, is made of 100% pure rubber from the rubber tree, Hevea brasillensi. These trees are sustainably grown in plantations in Malaysia. The rubber tree exudes a latex sap, the world\u2019s primary source of natural rubber, which is tapped in a similar manner to maple syrup from a maple tree. After about 20-25 years the tree stops producing latex sap. The trees are then harvested and replanted. The harvested wood is used extensively in furniture, flooring, construction and even toys. From seed to tree to ecopacifier to wooden toys, the Rubbertree has an eco-friendly, sustainable and high quality life. Ecopacifier is sustainably made in Malaysia. Ecopiggy is committed to offering the highest quality, natural products. We feel it's equally important to think of the overall footprint when manufacturing products, so we manufacturing our natural rubber pacifiers right at the source of natural rubber! They ship consolidated, and are once again hand-inspected and packaged in the USA. Happy Earth. Happy Families.",

All thoughts are completely my own.\u2014I was using Avent soothies before (as most do) and they weren\u2019t really cutting it for us. They always fell out of my baby boy\u2019s mouth and were causing nipple confusion. I found ecopiggy on Instagram and decided to give it a shot, and from the second I popped this in my 1.5m/o son\u2019s mouth, he wouldn\u2019t take any other pacifier. He LOVES this thing. The size and roundness of this paci makes sure it almost NEVER falls out- even when he stops sucking for a second. And this pacifier even improved his latch, which we\u2019d been having issues with at the time. I only bought one at first just in case he didn\u2019t like it, but fast forward to now- two months later- and I\u2019m stocking up on them. It looks super cute, it\u2019s all natural, and the large handle on it makes it ridiculously easy for my 3.5m/o to hold and pop back into his mouth. He just started learning to grab things and bring them to his mouth so he\u2019s still figuring out those motor skills, but he has no problem with his ecopiggy paci!I can\u2019t rave enough about this pacifier. I never thought I\u2019d love a pacifier so much (maybe more than my son does, ha!). I have to add also- when he\u2019s hungry and my hands are tied for whatever reason, this pacifier soothes him long enough until I can nurse him. Soothies never did that. He\u2019d spit them right out and cry.The ONLY downside is that the opening to the hollow bulb (the part you can stick your finger in on Soothies) is very small and hard to clean. Our little one manages to get spit up in unspeakable places, and the only way to clean it out of his paci is with the tiny bottle nipple brush that came with our Dr. Brown bottle set. Not too much of a hassle though.I bought our first paci from their website, and was very excited to find them on Amazon Prime.If you\u2019re contemplating buying this, just get it. And don\u2019t be nervous that there\u2019s only one review so far! Check their Instagram- they check out! @ecopiggy",

It did take a bit for our baby to warm up to them, i think because the rubber had a strong smell at first. Now he loves them, and he also chews on the sides and back when he\u2019s teething.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019d been struggling for weeks to find a pacifier that my 3 week old daughter enjoyed, could actually hold in her mouth, and wouldn\u2019t cause nipple confusion. This paci fit the bill in all of those categories. The Avent pacifier seemed to cause nipple confusion, the Cutie Pats (aside from being insanely expensive) made her gag and spit up, and the Natursuttens were hard for her to hold in her mouth. I found these and decided to try them. They may be more expensive than your typical super market brands, but are much cheaper than the brand name paci\u2019s. I love that they are all natural, all one piece, and come in a neutral color so that they match every outfit. They look SUPER cute on my baby\u2019s face too.The nipple is much larger than the Natursutten nipple, as you can see in the picture I included. In a breastfed baby, a large nipple on a pacifier is a good thing, as they have to take the breast deep in their mouth to get a proper latch. The larger nipple and rounded tip is also what helps babies hold the paci in their mouth. I also love the large handle. It make it easy to clip the paci onto things, and will make it easier (in the future) for my baby to put it back into her own mouth.I will buy these again and again!",

                "reviewText": "I did a ton of research on natural passies before i bought these, I did not want to paybills$9 each for hevea and 12$ each for naturstutten, I just knew there was something out there equally as good. I did buy the Bibs passies even though they have some plastic, and I liked them ok, but my son definitely prefers these. It took a little bit for him to get used to them though, prob about a day. These are the absolute best passies I've ever bought, my 3 month old loves them, he can hold them in his hands and he seems to enjoys that. Our 2 year old loves them too, even though she's not supposed to have a passie anymore... Bought these for our 4th child, so we have really bought a lot of passies... I absolutely love that these are natural and chemical free.",
