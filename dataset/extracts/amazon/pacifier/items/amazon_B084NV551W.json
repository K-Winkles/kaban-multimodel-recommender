It\u2019s harder for babies to keep them in their mouth but that\u2019s a good thing for breastfed babies!My only complaints is that they can be a little tricky to carry when your hands are full since they\u2019re harder to slip on a finger or something like that! They are also VERY bouncy and can very easily disappear. I would recommend always bringing at least two with you everywhere you go, just in case!",

They are cute pacifiers so look a little better if you need a pacifier for a more formal occasion as well. I would recommend connecting a silicone pacifier clip if you use a pacifier clip, however, as any other kind of clip ended up cutting into the silicone handle of the pacifier. This was not a big deal for us but worth noting. My daughter started using this pacifier at a few days old and still uses the same one at 15 months old, so it has held up really well. The size of the pacifier seemed appropriate for a newborn all the way through toddlerhood.",
