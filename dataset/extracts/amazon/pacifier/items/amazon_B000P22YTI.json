                "reviewText": "We LOVE the Wubs!! I'm sure the makers of this are millionaires- and they should be. We have about 5 of them and our daughter loves each and every one- she loves to rub them on her face too to put herself to sleep. If you try to give her a normal paci she will scream her head off- but the moment she feels the wub she calms down. This is a gift we recommend to any new parent. Even if you don't think you will be a paci family.... In case you are new to the wub- they are small soft stuffed animals that are sewn onto an Avent Pacifier.This particular frog seemed softer than our first frog wub we got (but that may be because our first frog has been washed so many times).Pros: Washable- this is huge, you just throw them in the washing machine and they come out sanitary and looking new again. They are usually practically dry when they come out so I can give them to our daughter right away if need be. Helps with weaning paci's- We have started trying to only allowing wub's in the crib. We actually bought this frog to cut the paci off and give her just the frog for when she is playing. She notices the paci is not there but when its the only option she still loves him! Helps you not lose it (as quickly)- We went through several normal paci's when she was a newborn, would set it down somewhere and then it was gone! The wub helps it to stand out. Seems trivial- but when you have a newborn and your baby is screaming its vital! Variety- they are just so darn cute! There are so many different animals, and it's so much cuter than her having a normal paci. It's also fun to see how much she has grown- the frog was half the size of her when she was born!Cons- There aren't many! They do get dirty -but again you can wash them. The only con is that my child won't take a normal paci, so if i forget to give one to the babysitter I am heading back with it.",

                "reviewText": "We have two Wubbanubs - frog and monkey - and they are wonderful. They've helped my son become more self-sufficient and work on his motor skills (he can hold onto it himself) and also saves us at night because we velcro it into his sleep sack swaddle strap so he can get it in his mouth without us having to get up and put it back 500 times. I was worried that it would be a pain because you can't really throw it in the dishwasher like I do with the regular soothers, but I've actually found that we're much more careful with it for that reason (and also because it has become a favorite toy so it would not be good to have to toss it). It is a little pricey, but it's worth it to us. We'll probably go through several before he's out of his binky phase.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a wubbanub for my baby when he was 2 months old because I was sick of having to get up multiple times early in the morning to put his pacifier back in his mouth and 4 months later I'm still so glad I got it for him! When he was little, I was nervous about it suffocating him so I only gave it to him during the day for naps and I used the regular pacifiers for longer stretches of sleep when I couldn't keep an eye on him. But now he sleeps with it all the time. I think the cutest thing in the whole world is watching him on the baby monitor wake up, find his wubby, turn it around in his hands until he has it in the right position, put it in his mouth, and fall back asleep. When we go out, I just tie it's leg to one of those pacifier clips and clip it to his shirt. It helps him sleep in the car and at home. To wash it, I just throw it in one of those mesh laundry bags and wash it whenever I do a load of his clothes, it's held up really well! I've washed it probably every week and a half for 4 months and it always looks better than it did when I threw it in.Now that he's 6 months old and starting to teethe I'm trying to decide how long to let him have it. I think for now I'm just going to inspect it before it give it to him and just keep using it because I don't know what I'm going to do without it!",

Easy to remember when on the go!Worth it! And I\u2019m seeing a lot of parents actually choose to cut the animal off and give it to the kid when they want to wean them of the pacifier.My kid loves it he clutches his froggy or piggy or Gigi and waves it in the air and plays with each of the little feet. \ud83d\ude2d\u2764\ufe0f No matter what we don\u2019t leave the house without one!He loves to chew on the animal as much as the pacifier so it gets slobbery with baby drool after a while like all favorite and well loved toys so you can just toss them in with the laundry.The pacifier is a good strong rubber (the same ones the have at the hospital) and goes through my dryer fine. Toy comes out plump and fresh!",
