        "description": "No more frustration trying to find your lost pacifiers at night! This pack includes two cute daytime pacifiers and one that glows in the dark, making it easy for baby and parent to find in the dark. BPA/BPS-free MAM Pacifiers were developed by leading pediatric dentists and developmental psychologists to provide maximum comfort and style for babies 6 months of age and older*. These pacifiers combine technological innovation and trendsetting design to help give babies a healthy start in life. Just because your baby's skin needs a bit of extra love and care shouldn't mean that he has to forego the soothing comfort of a pacifier. The MAM Air pacifier in this collection has a shield that is specially designed for babies with sensitive skin. The extra wide air holes allow plenty of circulation around your baby's mouth and even allow you to peek at their little smile. MAM pacifiers feature an innovative nipple designed to promote healthy oral development so you can soothe your baby with confidence. Baby will love latching onto the soothing pacifier nipple that, with the help of a built-in air channel, naturally flattens and extends when sucked, mimicking a human nipple during breastfeeding. And all MAM pacifiers are orthodontic, featuring a symmetrical nipple that fits perfectly in baby\u2019s mouth at any angle. MAM\u2019s medically engineered nipples all feature life-like, SkinSoft textured silicone that feels just like mom. With multiple pacifier shapes and shield sizes to pick from, MAM nipples are easily accepted by babies of all ages, with 94% nipple acceptance among babies tested.** Babies simply love the ease and comfort of latching onto MAM nipples. *Developed in conjunction with the International Children\u2019s Medical Research Society. **Market research 2010-2019, tested with 1,463 babies",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m 5 and a half months old and pride myself on being both a breastfeeding aficionado and binky connoisseur. Trust me - I have tried every shape, size, and flavor of binky out there. These are the real deal. I\u2019ve been using the newborn size and just made the move to these, and I can confirm that the mouthfeel is still beyond satisfactory. My mom works with babies in her day job and she had these silly fears that these binkies would confuse me into not eating as well, but I know how to handle myself with the milk nips - I\u2019m mostly just a binkie guy when I\u2019m sleepy or when my chauffeur gets stuck in traffic and I need a distraction. Take my word for it - if you need something to take the edge off after a hard day of playing, look no further.",
