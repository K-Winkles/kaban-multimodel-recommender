                "reviewText": "I first bought these when I again had to replace the 12 pacifiers that had gone missing. My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth. I came across these and bought them because they were super cute but was unsure if my daughter would like them. Previously I had bought pacifiers that looked like the ones the hospital provided but were not. The plastic used to make them were shiny and for whatever reason my daughter had no interest in them. I later discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack and Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green) for preemies. These wubbanubs were in fact made of the same material and perfect for my little one. I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown. I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier. These pacifiers are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night. My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth. I have yet to lose these unlike the gazillion other pacifiers I have purchased over the years. They make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It is a somewhat meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib. So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills. There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey . The WubbaNub Tabby Kitten is my favorite. I have noticed that it is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same. The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush, however, I usually cut the pacifier out after its seen some wear. Just as a caution. Once you stitch the the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket. I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer. Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll. It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free.",

                "reviewText": "This is wonderful. I used this for my child and buy them for others. Yes, it is a binky. But it's easier to break the binky habit than it is to break the thumb sucking habit. The pacifier itself is the exact same one the hospital gave me when my child was born. I got one with a stiffed animal attached for multiple reasons, but mostly because we got tired of always bending over to pick it up when my 2 month old would spit it out of his mouth.So after using one for about a year, here's what we have learned. The fabric of the animal is soft and gives baby a feel of texture. It is light weight, yet stays put on baby when spit out. Don't have to keep bending over to pick it up. Teaches baby eye- hand coordination by baby putting it in and out of the mouth at 3-6 months old. Teaches self soothing, by baby being able to put it in his/her mouth on their own. And of course, easy to get rid of without having to worry about continued thumb sucking.It is not machine washable, but can be spot cleaned. Ours lasted about a year before we stopped using it, when our son began to teethe, and the pacifier was still holding well, no chips etc. It is NOT recommended to continue to use this once baby begins teething. And of course, it's a cute monkey!",

                "reviewText": "After stumbling into my six-month-old's bedroom in the middle of the night and searching around her crib for her paci in the dark, I posted a little rant on Facebook about how pacis should glow in the dark. A flood of friends commented that I need to forget the simple paci and graduate to the wubbanub.Okay, I thought, I'll try it. After a month, i love it! Here are my thoughts:Pros:--my daughter can easily hold it and put it in her mouth. She doesn't quite have the motor skills to get the nipple of the paci in her mouth without the Wubbanub attachment.--The hands and feet have little beany things in them, which makes them fun for my daughter to chew on. She's teething now and I think those beany things provide a nice texture for her. The fabric material of the Wubbanub is also soothing to her while she munches down on the feet and hands of the little monkey.--It's machine-washable! Wahoo!Cons:--This thing is filthy. My daughter has been chewing on it a lot lately because of the teething thing. In fact, she doesn't really use the paci part at all right now. So because the fabric part is in her mouth so much, it's a really dirty toy. I would absolutely recommend buying a darker color Wubbanub and washing it often. I have friends that have lighter color ones and they just look so, so dirty and gross.--My daughter is in a dropping phase. We love toys that can be hooked onto her seat or stroller. Unfortunately, this monkey Wubbanub cannot be hooked onto anything. I could probably improvise by either making a hook thing myself with a suspender clip and ribbon, but it would be great if this came with a loop that I could hook a ribbon or other pre-made device through.All in all, my friends are right: the Wubbanub is fantastic and my daughter absolutely loves it!Updated 5/13/2016When my second daughter was born, we bought another monkey \"Wubby\" for her and she has slept with it every night since she was about 3 months old. I put a paci clip through the hole in the pacifier so she can have it attached to her pajamas and never lose it at night. This has been the perfect solution to every missing paci issue.However, a couple of weeks ago (when she was 18 months old), she bit off the tip of the pacifier. I couldn't find it anywhere and assumed she swallowed it...I found it yesterday on the living room floor (no idea how it got there). I contacted the company to let them know what happened and to ask if this is normal. Most of my friends have wubbys and use them for years as their security toy. The company said that the Wubbanub is not for older babies--just babies 0-6 months old and that they are working on products for older kids. SOOOOO...bear in mind that the Wubby is only for babies 0-6 months. The company refunded my money, which I thought was an incredibly nice gesture that I didn't even ask for.I let my 18 month old have the monkey part of the wubby with the nipple cut off so she can't chew it off any more. The monkey stays with her in her crib at night and is her favorite toy/security item.",

                "reviewText": "Ich habe sehr lange nach den richtigen Beruhigungssauger f\u00fcr meine Tochter gesucht. Da sie als Neugeborene Schwierigkeiten hatte andere Sauger zu akzeptieren und sich davor geekelt hatte und sie aber einen Saugersatz brauchte, da ich nicht l\u00e4nger stillen konnte, wurde ich nach sehr langem Suchen und Ausprobieren f\u00fcndig!Die schmale Form ist perfekt f\u00fcr kleine Baby M\u00fcnder und nicht so riesig wie manch andere. Dadurch das es keine R\u00e4nder und L\u00f6cher gibt, ist er sehr hygienisch und Kinder bekommen dadurch keinen Mundsoor, wie meine \u00e4ltere Tochter es oft hatte mit anderen Schnullern!Dadurch das ein niedliches Stofftier dran ist, kann das Kind es wirlkich gut kuscheln, bei S\u00e4uglingen ist es zum Vorteil da der Nucki oft rausf\u00e4llt, hier aber durch das Gewicht im Mund bleibt, oder man kann den Nucki neben dem Babykopf legen, so das es Luft bekommt, aber den Nucki im Mund beh\u00e4lt. Also wenn das Baby seitlich liegt kann man den Nucki gut so legen dass er drin bleibt, ohne das er rausf\u00e4llt. Wenn das Baby auf den R\u00fccken liegt, platziert man den Nucki auf der brust und es kann das Stofftier begutachten und gleichzeitig dabei saugen.Meine Kleine ist nun 1 Jahr alt und er ist einfach ihr liebster Gegenstand, er ist ihr Beruhiger in allen Situationen, er kommt immer mit, er wird stets gebraucht und geknuddelt - und wehe nicht!Es ist einer der besten Erfindungen und wird wenn sie \u00e4lter ist und den Sauger nicht mehr braucht, als Stofftier dienen, dann muss man den Sauger eben abtrennen.Ich hab mich f\u00fcr den Affen entschieden, da er super auf den Bauch liegt, man kann ihn gut formen so wie man ihn braucht. Dadurch das man die Arme und Beine auseinander machen kann, liegt der Nucki perfekt so dass er nicht runterf\u00e4llt, selbst wenn das Baby sich bewegt, bleibt er in Position, so dass es sich auch selbst helfen kann. Sp\u00e4ter, nimmt ihr Baby den Nucki sowieso so wie es will. Er eignet sich \u00fcbrigens auch super oder gar besser als manch Bei\u00dfringe!!! Das muss man noch dazu sagen. Wenn ihr Baby anf\u00e4ngt zu zahnen wird es auch darauf rumkauen und er wird dadurch nicht kaputt gehen! Es ist ein geniales Ding und den Preis Wert! Wie gesagt er wird von Anfang an geliebt und passt sich der Mundform an, ist angenehm zum saugen und einfach ein \"Must Have.\"",
