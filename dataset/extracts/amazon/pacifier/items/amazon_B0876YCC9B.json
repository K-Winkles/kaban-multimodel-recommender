The heart-shaped shield fits perfectly under baby\u2019s nose for easier breathing and to prevent irritation. The unique, breast-like nipple naturally fits baby\u2019s palate and helps promote healthy oral development. Invented over 60 years ago by pediatric dentists and doctors, NUK orthodontic pacifiers are modeled after the natural shape of mom\u2019s nipple while breastfeeding, creating an easy transition from breast to pacifier and back. The NUK\u00ae Comfy\u2122 pacifier is made of 100% medical-grade silicone, and is BPA-free and dishwasher-safe (top rack only).",
