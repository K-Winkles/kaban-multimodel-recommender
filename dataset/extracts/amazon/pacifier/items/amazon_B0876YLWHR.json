        "description": "Having a difficult time finding the right pacifier for your baby? The new NUK Space pacifiers have a revolutionary shield that has extra-large openings, enabling maximum airflow and allowing baby\u2019s gentle skin to \u201cbreathe.\u201d Like all NUK pacifiers, NUK Space is accepted by 95% of babies* and feature the improved orthodontic nipple shape. NUK\u2019s asymmetrical nipple naturally fits baby\u2019s palate and is now improved to allow for more room for a natural sucking motion, reduce pressure on teeth and jaw, and helps prevent teeth misalignment. Invented over 60 years ago by pediatric dentists and doctors, the NUK pacifier is modeled after the natural shape of mom\u2019s nipple while breastfeeding. This makes for an easy transition from breast to pacifier and back. The NUK heart-shaped shield on NUK Space fits perfectly under baby\u2019s nose for easier breathing and prevents irritation. (*Based on Market Research, 2017, tested with 307 pacifier users)",

No issues as with other brands.Update 1/15/2021: I really prefer this NUK design with the holes because there\u2019s more airflow vs with the other NUK it would press against my son\u2019s mouth area and once there is drool it just stays there pressed against the skin. This one is so much better! Highly recommended.",
