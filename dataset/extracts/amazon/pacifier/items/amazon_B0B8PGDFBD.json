                "reviewText": "This pacifier clip is a really good clip and serves its purpose well. It has been extremely helpful with teething and stays attached to babys clothes despite their strong grip and tugs. And it's silicone design is better than fabic clips that can hold bacteria. However there is room for improvement for longevity. After 2 months of usage there is constant rusting of the metal. It's shiny metal end is enticing and has become my baby's favorite part of the clip. Because of the constant saliva and water from washing it, you get a green rust, similar to fake jewelry turning your ear, especially at the point where it connects to the silicone. This product would be better if the end of made of stainless steel or even plastic rather than its copper penny material. I will be replacing it and wish it could have lasted a little bit longer.",

I may try to bed the clip a bit with a pliers so it clips tighter. It falls on the ground less, but doesn\u2019t quite fix the problem.",
