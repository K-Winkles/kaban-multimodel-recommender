Of critical importance is the growth and size of the palate (the top of the mouth). The pediatric dentist on our team at Smilo studies growth rates in infants, babies, and toddlers to inform our approach to designing pacifiers sizes. We have four stages of pacifiers to ensure the right size and the right fit as your baby grows from newborn to 18 months. The stage/age guide below may vary a little bit for your baby depending on gender, weight, the timing of tooth eruption, and other genetic factors. But with four stages to grow with, you can rest easy knowing that Smilo has baby covered!",

                "reviewText": "I love the fact they're glow in the dark, it makes finding the paci 1000% easier when your baby's teething and waking frequently through the night. Total lifesaver. I got these because they're recommended for my baby's age range (9m-1y) & so far he likes them, not the brand shape he's used to, but he still takes it. So that's really something! Only thing is it's very light white & clear so finding it anywhere else is kind of a struggle.. so far we haven't lost any of them though. I'd give 8/10.",

You need to check the one starts because those are usually the most truthful.These products have a major design flaw that is also a safety hazard and I don\u2019t believe these should be sold. There\u2019s holes in the plastic where it connects to the small handle and it allows water to flow through into the nipple. You can\u2019t get the water out, even if leaving out to dry which makes these susceptible to mold. Buyer beware!",
