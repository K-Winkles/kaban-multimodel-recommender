I like that they are carried separately, so the pacifiers aren\u2019t touching. It is also very easy to clean as it is a hard surface. It\u2019s been consistently used for 2 months so far, and hangs on a loop outside the diaper bag and each compartment door still feels just as secure as when I first purchased it. Perfect price!",

I love that there is a removable silicone strap as wellPacifier holder: This product is a bit bulky and heavy. It just takes up a bit more space in the diaper bag than I would like. Otherwise, it works fine. I like that is can fit two pacifiers and can be washed in the dishwasher easily.",

                "reviewText": "LOVE this product!! I hated letting my son's binkies touch any kind of surface. It was so hard to sanitize when we were out and about. I used to put the binkies into ziplock bags and then into his diaper bag, but they were so hard to find when I needed them! I specifically bought this pacifier holder with the virus in mind. It's a very thick, durable plastic that makes it easy to sanitize compared to the cloth pods. It attaches to the diaper bag easily and I have no fear of it falling off or coming undone. It's got two separate compartments to store two different pacifiers. Super easy to get to when needed. The compartments are big enough to fit all kinds of pacifiers. We have all our pacifiers on lanyards and they fit into these compartments with the lanyards on them as well!The only con I have for this product is that it is sorta heavy and bulky compared to the cloth pods. It also doesn't have any sort of design or pattern (but I like plain anyhow.)Definitely recommend to all my mommas!",

I used to just deal with a ziploc bag or using Avent pacifiers and its carrying case to haul the pacifiers while going out. My newborn prefers the itzy ritzy pacies so I needed a bigger container. This fits really well and has a lovely silicone strap to hang onto my baby bag. Very easy to clean and dishwasher safe. Super durable, quality is excellent. Highly recommend!",
