        "description": "Finally, a pacifier that soothes babies and parents too! Silicone Mini is an extra light, ultra-small orthodontic pacifier that was designed especially for newborn babies. Mini is 15% lighter and 10% smaller than our #1-selling/award winning silicone pacifiers. Loved by newbies - Mini has a 95% acceptance rate*. The Mini pacifier isn\u2019t just for pacifying, but is also developed for comfort, breathing and orthodontic benefits. Clinical studies show that PhysioForma pacifiers actively support baby\u2019s breathing by positioning the tongue forward to maintain an open airway, which is especially important during sleep. Physiological breathing improves quality of sleep and reduces irritability.The unique angle and lateral curve of the nipple evenly distribute tongue pressure across baby's palate. Tiny ridges and an inclined nipple shape guide proper tongue placement. Together, these important features support baby's growing palate and teeth.Gentle against baby's delicate skin, the soft silicone shield is comfortable and breathable. Ventilation holes promote air circulation & help reduce moisture buildup.One-piece silicone construction conforms to the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 guidelines for pacifier usage. Another benefit of the one-piece design - parents can insert finger inside the nipple for extra bonding with baby.The exclusive PhysioForma nipple design was developed, tested, and approved in partnership with an advisory panel of leading neonatologists, pediatricians, and orthodontists.Available for babies 0 to 2m. Reusable sterilizing carry case included.*2019 consumer test on 127 babies in Italy, 0-2 months",

I have others that seemed too big for her mouth, like touching her nose, but these are a perfect for her face. And man can she get a grip on these, try to take it from her, I dare you. Because they fit so well and she can get good suction on them, they don\u2019t fall out. A pro for the silicone they are easy to clean and you don\u2019t have to worry about any water collecting inside them. Sterilize well in the brezza. I will definitely buy the next size up for her.",

It stays in her mouth and she can thrust it out if she is gonna spit up. It does discolor easily and require being replaced often.TIP: don\u2019t buy the clear ones or you\u2019ll be searching for it in the night. Also doesn\u2019t have anything for it to attach a clip on. The holes arent great since it\u2019ll rub on her face. I just wrappers the string in the front twice. Seemed to work surprisingly. The length was just perfect to double loop but it was just luck. It\u2019s light so it\u2019s not too heavy for newborns.",
