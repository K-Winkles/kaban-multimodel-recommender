I can\u2019t say enough great things about these.Also*** I absolutely love that the entire thing is soft and rubber because I put my daughter to sleep with these and she drops it halfway through the night and ends up laying on it most of the time, but because the entire thing is soft it doesn\u2019t bug or hurt her at all.

                "reviewText": "I was searching for a pacifier like Natursutten that didn't cost a crazy amount of money. I loved that these come in a pack of three for under 20$ - safe natural pacifiers should not have to be a luxury item - it also made me happy to read that they are made from a single mold so it is unlikely that pieces will just break off in babies mouth. It is interesting to hear about the trees they are made from if you are ever interested in looking it up. I also was worried about the smell but it is not at all as strong as some reviewers make it seem and smells to me almost medical. The pacifier is soft and flexible and I was happy for the orthodontic shape for baby's mouth. So far I'm impressed!Edit- as a newborn baby didn't like these. It took a week or two in soothers before we transitioned to these pacifiers. They seem to stay in his mouth better than the soothers now so we use them interchangeably. Also the rubber smell has seriously diminished in the few short weeks we have been using them.",

The rubber was definitely thinner than other brands I've tried, but the price of these was 3 for the price of 1 of the more expensive brands. My kids won't use the rubber ones, so I opted for BPA free from NUK and Avent, with silicone orthodontic nipples. Rubber is supposedly healthier though, if your baby will take it.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this product because I needed a pacifier quickly and the brand (Natursutten) I had been using for my baby would not ship as quickly. I also was drawn to the 3 pack option as the other brand only shipped single packaged pacifiers.Both pacifiers claimed to be natural rubber and BPA free. Both pacifiers gave instructions to boil the pacifier before using it and replacing the pacifier around 6-8 weeks as the rubber will start to break down.Some differences I noticed immediately upon opening the package...Thr Eco brand pacifier\u2019s rubber appeared darker in color and the orthodontic tip was larger than the previous brand. Eco brand was to be boiled for 5 minutes before initial use. This pacifier\u2019s design has an opening from the handle side into the orthodontic tip which allows air/water/spit up/etc. in; the other brand was sealed off. The Eco brand\u2019s handle is more substantial and rigid.Although there were slight differences in size, my baby took to the Eco brand just fine. I appreciated the rigid handle because if the pacifier fell out in the middle of the night in the dark, it was much easier to distinguish which side was \u201cup\u201d without having to use a light source. Sometimes those few precious seconds make all the difference when calming a fussy baby.My baby used the pacifier regularly throughout the day, between feedings to help with acid reflux, when not talking or playing, and sometimes while sleeping. I rinsed the pacifier regularly throughout the day and boiled per instructions on an (almost) daily basis to disinfect. After about a week, I noticed after disinfecting the pacifier that my baby was not taking the pacifier as quickly as before. I inspected it and noticed that it smelled strongly of burnt rubber. As I had just boiled the pacifier, I tried running it under water with the thought that it must still be slightly warm and that was creating the smell. When rinsing with cold water did not help, I inspected the pacifier further. I put it in my mouth and sucked it like my baby would. There was a definite rubber taste. So I tossed that one and prepared the second pacifier in my Eco brand 3 pack. Initially it smelled fine and my baby took it without trouble. However, just as with the first pacifier, this second one began smelling strongly of burnt rubber and developed a bad taste after disinfecting via the package instructions to boil in water, and my baby would not take it.This brand appears to be inferior quality, emitting a bad smell and taste, possibly leaving a film in the mouth as it breaks down over short period of time following regular disinfectant instructions. I threw away the third pacifier in the pack and reordered the brand I had initially purchased. Although this pacifier had some nice features, I would not recommend it.",
