                "reviewText": "This is a brilliant product!We introduced our son to pacifiers at 2 months and quickly found he (like alot of babies) would drop and lose his pacifier. We did not like the idea of getting a pacifier leash so we did a bit of looking and found wannanub.When you get one though go ahead and buy two (we bought different animals so he would not get fixated on one.) The reason I suggest buying two is: (1) you always have the possibly of losing one (sorry foxy, we didn't mean to lose you) and (2) you can wash them with your baby's clothes on gentle.After a year the pacifiers became worn, but you can buy the avent pacifiers 2 pack and replace it for a couple bucks. (I'm a decent seamstress, but you don't need to be, just cut the threads where the pacifier is sewn in, pull out the old pacifier, put the new one in, and use a thimble with a thick needle to get nice tight stiches. If you don't have the strenght you can use a husband with pliers.)The best part about this product is I found our son is weaning himself off of it much quicker than some of my friend's children and ALL BY HIMSELF! He is 16 months and rarely used the pacifier part of the wannanub. I recently removed the pacifier on both of his wannanubs and sewed them up and they just turned into nap stuffies. He did ge a bit upset, but there was no huge fuss like I've seen in the past and he did suck on the feet the first two nights, but stopped that on his own and now just snuggles with them.I was never a fan of pacifiers because I hated how fixated some toddlers become. Wannanub has made a great product that allows newborns the ability to grab their own pacifiers and cuddle buddies, babies the ability to easily carry and put down their pacifiers for an easier ability to crawl and learn, and a great method for toddlers to transition away from their pacifiers.I plan to add this product to all my baby shower gifts!",

It\u2019s also like he likes the light weight feeling on his chest from the moose. Our 5 year old has named it \u201cMr. Moose\u201d and has a song for his baby brother. We love this pacifier and have another as well, buts it\u2019s a different animal.",
