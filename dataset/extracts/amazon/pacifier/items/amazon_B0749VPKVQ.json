(Between: 32% \u2013 83% thinner / 1.1 \u2013 19.5 times more flexible than regular silicone pacifiers). *** Market Research 2009-2017, tested with 1,508 babies. Please avoid leaving the pacifier in the sterilising solution for longer than the time recommended. Sometimes water may enter the inside of the nipple, this is because of a ventilation systems that exists in the nipple and helps make the pacifier orthodontic.",

They are very durable - my daughter has been teething non stop since 5 months and episodically she chews and bites her pacis-we haven\u2019t had any issues to this day. Also I love that they glow in the dark and are very easy to locate at night time for the baby or me if I have to come into her room to soothe her. And additionally I have a peace of mind about the bite and those are the only pacis we have been using since 6 months when her first teeth came out. The storage/cleaning container is another great bonus-comes in handy for quick sterilization or for when we travel to nana or out of town",

What is pictured here is what I was expecting. This site didn't let me select any other graphic on the pacifier so I thought I was getting \"Sweet Dreams\" and the Star. Received something totally different but not worth sending back. Just the expectation wasn't met. Otherwise, great product!",

Cute design also and has helped with the teeth grow. Very flexible and not thick like other pacifiers. Iv always liked mams products and it's the only pacifier my baby will take, He's breastfed so is very picky. Iv tried numerous and he only takes this one. I recommend this to other mamas",

My daughter has no trouble going from breastfeeding to using her pacifier at all. Only thing I would say I dislike is that when cleaning them/sterilizing them, it does get water trapped in the nipple part of the pacifier. Other than that we Absolutley love these, wouldn\u2019t use anything else.",

I got the set that comes with the one that says sweet dreams and the other with stars. It's still cute but the whole reason I purchased it was to get the moon pacifier. I'm a moon and stars fanatic but other then that I'm happy with it and so is my baby. I love that they glow in the dark. It makes life easier to be able to find the pacifier in the dark instead of having to turn on the light which wakes the baby then nobody sleeps. I also love that it comes with its own sterilizing case. I'm obsessed with the mam pacifiers. They have the coolest designs to choose from so your baby can be suckin in style. My son has at least 10 if them. They're great \ud83d\udc99",

                "reviewText": "I do like the design of the other MAM binkies that don't cover as much of the face, but this style nipple is definitely the best. I don't have to worry about it messing with my son's bite at all because of the thin base. For anyone worrying about how thin it is: when I threw away our old ones that were probably about 6 months old and well used, I tried them out. I bit it and pulled as hard as I could, and it barely even left a mark on the nipple. I definitely trust these binkies.",
