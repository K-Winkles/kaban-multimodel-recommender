I\u2019ve seen these online and wanted to try them for my baby since she\u2019s ready to eat on her own. Although she\u2019s eating food, I am still wary about choking. I love these for fruit and veggies. I do chop/cut them up well so she is able to slowly eat it on her own. They are the perfect size for her to grab and for her mouth to chew. Very easy to clean as well. They do stain but only with certain foods like steamed carrots. Strawberries and blueberries seemed to work best so far.",
