        "description": "\"Keep your toddler calm with a binky that you will both love. The MAM Original Pacifier was developed by leading pediatric dentists and developmental psychologists to provide maximum comfort and style for babies sixteen months and older.* MAM pacifiers feature an innovative nipple designed to promote healthy oral development so you can soothe your toddler with confidence. Older babies will love latching onto the soothing pacifier nipple that, with the help of a built-in air channel, naturally flattens and extends when sucked, mimicking a human nipple during breastfeeding. And all MAM pacifiers are orthodontic, featuring a symmetrical nipple that fits perfectly in baby's mouth at any angle. MAM's medically engineered nipples all feature life-like, SkinSoft textured silicone that feels more natural, just like mom. With multiple pacifier shapes and shield sizes to pick from, MAM nipples are easily accepted by babies of all ages, with 94% nipple acceptance among babies tested.** Babies simply love the ease and comfort of latching onto MAM nipples. Plus, the sterilizing storage case makes it easy to keep baby safe from germs with fast, easy cleaning right in the box. Microwave disinfection is proven effective in killing common household germs and bacteria. Pacifiers kept in the closed box will remain disinfected for up to 48 hours: Fill pacifier case with water. Place pacifier in the pacifier case with the nipple facing down. Follow pacifier package instructions for microwave setting. Cool completely before use. *Developed with the International Children's Medical Research Society. ** Market Research 2009-2017, tested with 1,508 babies.\"",

Every baby is different but I tried other brands with my son when he was a newborn and they would just fall out. Once he tried the MAM he was hooked. We have bought many sizes of these pacifiers and have even bought some little animal to attach to them when he was really small and was having trouble putting the pacifier back in. We love these pacifier and I would recommend trying them out if you have a fussy little one.",

We are still trying to limit use as his dentist said his pallet has negative changes and his binky use has impacted his teeth.",

I was looking for a large size and was excited to find these. However the difference between this size and the one under it is sooooo tiny! Such a small difference I will just purchase smaller size since those come in more options/colors etc. Great pacifier, it is a TEENY TINY bit larger, great quality like all MAM binkies but honestly the size difference isn\u2019t worth being stuck with a house full of this patterned binkie lol",
