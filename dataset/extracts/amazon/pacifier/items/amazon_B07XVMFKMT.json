                "reviewText": "Both my children have loved the bibs dummies, they look great and are easy cleaned. They are more expensive than other brands but I think they are worth it. I do tend to buy the deluxe version as my son tends to mess with the back of the dummy and spit can get in the back of the standard ones. This isn\u2019t an issue with the deluxe version. Will continue to purchase and would recommend.",

Not very hygienic and I'm worried that it could come off if pulled.I prefer the natural rubber dummies that come in one piece, they're much easier to clean and safer from my point of view.I wish they made an orthodontic teat option too.",
