        "description": "Having a difficult time finding the right pacifier for your baby? The new NUK pacifiers are accepted by 95% of babies* and feature the improved orthodontic nipple shape. NUK\u2019s asymmetrical nipple naturally fits baby\u2019s palate and is now improved to allow for more room for a natural sucking motion, reduce pressure on teeth and jaw, and helps prevent teeth misalignment. Invented over 60 years ago by pediatric dentists and doctors, the NUK pacifier is modeled after the natural shape of mom\u2019s nipple while breastfeeding. This makes for an easy transition from breast to pacifier and back. The NUK heart-shaped shield fits perfectly under baby\u2019s nose for easier breathing and prevents irritation. Now all NUK pacifiers are available in a reusable storage case that allows for easy cleaning in the microwave. With super-cute designs, this pack of 2 orthodontic pacifiers is ideal for your child aged 18-36 months.
