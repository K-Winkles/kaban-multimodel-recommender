The new NUK Space pacifiers have a revolutionary shield that has extra-large openings, enabling maximum airflow and allowing baby's gentle skin to \"breathe.\" Like all NUK pacifiers, NUK Space is accepted by 95% of babies and feature the improved orthodontic nipple shape. NUK's asymmetrical nipple naturally fits baby's palate and is now improved to allow for more room for a natural sucking motion, reduce pressure on teeth and jaw, and helps prevent teeth misalignment. Invented over 60 years ago by pediatric dentists and doctors, the NUK pacifier is modeled after the natural shape of mom's nipple while breastfeeding. This makes for an easy transition from breast to pacifier and back. The NUK heart-shaped shield on NUK Space fits perfectly under baby's nose for easier breathing and prevents irritation. Now all NUK pacifiers are available in a reusable storage case that allows for easy cleaning in the microwave. With koala and Tiger designs, this pack of 2 orthodontic pacifiers is ideal for your little one aged 0-6 months. (Based on Market Research, 2017, tested with 307 pacifier users)",

We were using the silicone ones and ever since starting solids he has been getting a rash on the sides of his mouth. We got these hoping to help with that. It did help. And I love how cute they are. The bug one is glow in the dark so it helps us when he fusses in the middle of the night and we (and he) can see to put them in without turning on a light. They are easy to clean or pop in the dishwasher. My only complaint is that the front design scratches off easy. So if it hits against anything, it scratches it off.",

This hasn't always been the case but I'm glad I was lucky enough to recieve the items shown :) My son has been using these pacis since he was a month old, this is all he will take, we are finally starting to ween off of them but because he has teeth now they break every so often, but they aren't to expensive so all is well! They are thin but also makes the weening easier. Love to have a couple on hand just in case!",
