                "reviewText": "I wish I would have just purchased this product to start with. It is definitely worth the extra money.It took a few days for my baby to get used to this and figure out how it works, but now it's a hit! She smiles and diligently works to feed herself by gnawing on it, and from the reduction in overall tears and fussiness, the cold fruit/food/milk appears to help take the edge off of her teething pain.It is very easy and quick to clean and put back together again. The three different nipple sizes are great. Right now she is on the smallest size (the other two are too big for her little mouth) and I'm glad that I'll be able to adjust the product as she grows without having to buy another unit.Originally I purchased another product that was similar but cheaper, but it only came with one nipple that was quite too big for my six month old baby to fit in her mouth at any angle, rendering it useless until her mouth grows considerably.So if you're debating whether to go with a single cheaper option, or this product, I definitely recommend just going ahead and buying this one to start with.",
