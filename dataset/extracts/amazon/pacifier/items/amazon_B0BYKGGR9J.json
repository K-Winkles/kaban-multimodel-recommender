The nipple shape is great and a favorite of all my kids (and we tried every available style on the market to find that out). This shield is awesome because it minimizes the chance of any skin irritation around the mouth and also is less intrusive looking. You see more adorable face and less pacifier. Also very easy for the kiddos to hold in their hand.Hold up well over time, handy sterilization case / carrying case, cute designs... no complaints here other than this style can e tricky to locate in stores so I always ordered extra to have on hand just in case.",
