When mom\u2019s breast isn\u2019t available, our Breast-like pacifier is the next best thing for baby to latch onto in between feeds. Made from super soft silicone, this pacifier feels, moves, flexes and stretches just like skin so there\u2019s less chance of confusion when feeding baby from breast or bottle. The natural feel and flex of this breast-like pacifier, inspired by our award-winning Closer to Nature\u00ae nipple, provides a reassuring alternative to traditional pacifiers. Perfect if you\u2019re worried that offering your baby a pacifier may disrupt breast or bottle feeding. As the symmetrical silicone baglet is fully reversible, there is no \u2018wrong\u2019 side-up so the pacifier will always be placed correctly in your baby\u2019s mouth, even when they put it in their mouth themselves. The breast-like pacifier shield curves away from baby\u2019s face and offers superior ventilation and extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby\u2019s delicate skin against irritation. BPA-free and easy to clean - simply pop in a sterilizer, wash by hand or in the dishwasher. We recommend that you replace the pacifier every month and always at the first signs of damage or weakness. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months.",
