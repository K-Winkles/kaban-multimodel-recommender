When mom\u2019s breast isn\u2019t available, our Breast-like pacifier is the next best thing for baby to latch onto in between feeds. This pacifier glows in the dark for up to 8 hours which allows parents to locate the pacifier in a dark room without having to disturb baby. During the day your pacifier will recharge in natural light. Inspired by our award-winning Closer to Nature\u00ae nipple, this super soft silicone pacifier feels, moves, flexes and stretches just like skin so there\u2019s less chance of confusion when feeding baby from breast or bottle - perfect if you\u2019re worried that offering your baby a pacifier may disrupt breast or bottle feeding. As the symmetrical silicone baglet is fully reversible, there is no \u2018wrong\u2019 side-up so the pacifier will always be placed correctly in your baby\u2019s mouth, even when they put it in their mouth themselves. The pacifier shield curves away from baby\u2019s face and offers superior ventilation and extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby\u2019s delicate skin against irritation. We recommend that you replace the pacifier every month and always at the first signs of damage or weakness. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months.",
