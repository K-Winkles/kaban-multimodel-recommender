I used to struggle putting that little loop through one of those tiny binky holes to keep the binky clip on, and then I'd struggle all over again to get it off of the binky. These have been amazing! I put it on the binky clip, and can easily slip the scilicone holder on and off the binky! They go on the MAM binkies easily, and stay put until I take it off. Plus, no more hard crusty binky clip loops from all the drool and spit up leaking all over it. They're easy to clean, and so far, they've held up really well!",
