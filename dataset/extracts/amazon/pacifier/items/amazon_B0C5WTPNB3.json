                "reviewText": "This is a very nice set of fruit feeders and bowl/spoon feeder set for your growing child just when you are starting to introduce new food items to your baby other than mothers milk.You get six different size fruit nipples that should last a long time as your baby grows and allows you to choose the right size for your child. The holes in the nipples are small enough to prevent any large chunks or seeds pass through yet large enough to provide a stimulating experience for your baby by chewing fruit.It also comes with a cover for the fruit nipples which means you can use it easily on the go as well . The fruit feeder is also shaped like a baby pacifier so your baby is familiar with the shape and increases the chances of the baby accepting it quickly .An added bonus of this kit is the bowl and spoon feeder to giving your child semi solid food , baby food mixes . All this for $6 is a phenomenal price and great value for money . I would definitely recommend this to our other family and friends . 5 stars",

But it's really cool to suck on cold fruit and also get some nutrition and flavor at the same time. In terms of the build quality these are made quite nice and I like how the clamp secures the silicone nipple part to the base.I also feel like this pack comes with a nice amount of shapes and replacement parts so the value is definitely there for $8.Everything is super easy to clean, as it should be. So this is a really nice pack. I just personally don't like using these things so much.This review was written for: Funbliss Baby Fruit Feeder Pacifier with Spoon Bottle | BPA-Free Silicone Teething Toy | Mesh Fresh Food Feeder for Babies | Infant Teether and Feeding Pacifier Set | Dishwasher and Boil Safe Yellow",
