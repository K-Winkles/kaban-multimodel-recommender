Kind of sad parents these days will not understand the struggle of keeping the baby still, holding a plate/ bowl/ bottle of food, keeping it all together to perfectly execute one successful bite of food.

                "reviewText": "I had just one of the containers with the spoon. So I had to buy the whole set. It is the best way to feed an infant pureed food, especially if they're very impatient (like my grandson)! I couldn't get the spoon from the bowl to his mouth fast enough!!! He eats a whole package of baby food without making a hugh mess or throwing a fit because it is taking too long. With a bib on or even a cloth to wipe off the little bit that gets around his mouth,it is a very simple and rather clean process. They have suction cups on the spoon containers are that very nice and convenient. It is a secure way to set the spoon down without them falling or rolling away.The teething pacifiers are also perfect. My son and I freeze some pureed fruit in it and my grandson loves it. Chewing on it helps his gums and once it starts to defrost, he sucks every last bit out. I highly recommend these. I will probably even buy one more set. I actually have bought two of these sets, one for me and one for my son's house.",
