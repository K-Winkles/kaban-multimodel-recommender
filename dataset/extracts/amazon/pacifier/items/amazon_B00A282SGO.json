The buttons on these unisex baby pacifiers glow in the dark, making them easy for baby and parent to find at night. BPA/BPS-free MAM Night Pacifiers were developed by leading pediatric dentists and developmental psychologists to provide maximum comfort and style for babies age 0-6 months.* These night pacifiers combine technological innovation and trendsetting design to help give babies a healthy start in life. MAM pacifiers feature an innovative nipple designed to promote healthy oral development so you can soothe your baby with confidence. Baby will love latching onto the soothing pacifier nipple that, with the help of a built-in air channel, naturally flattens and extends when sucked, mimicking a human nipple during breastfeeding. And all MAM pacifiers are orthodontic, featuring a symmetrical nipple that fits perfectly in baby\u2019s mouth at any angle. MAM\u2019s medically engineered nipples all feature life-like, SkinSoft textured silicone that feels just like mom. With multiple pacifier shapes and nipple sizes to pick from, MAM nipples are easily accepted by babies of all ages, with 94% nipple acceptance among babies tested.** Babies simply love the ease and comfort of latching onto MAM nipples. *Developed in conjunction with the International Children\u2019s Medical Research Society. ** Market research 2010-2019, tested with 1,463 babies.",

They fit snugly to his face and don\u2019t fall out unless he\u2019s done with it. I was disappointed when these came I got a different design on the pacifier than what was displayed in pictures but that doesn\u2019t matter to my 7 week old. I love the glow in the dark ones, they\u2019re so easy to spot in a dark room. I can also use regular pacifier clips with these I just strap it through one of the vent holes and it works great. Also import to note these pacifiers have not impacted his ability to breastfeed at all.",

They are colorful and cute and calm in an easy to store a container so I do not have to worry about them touching anything else and getting contaminated. I just disinfect them every night and put them back in their containers and use them in the morning.",

                "reviewText": "These are lifesavers. When I'm trying to put my baby down and she's a little fussy, I offer her the MAM pacifier and she instantly starts sucking away and closes her eyes. She much prefers these than other types of pacifiers. Sometimes I'll offer the silicone, straight, oval-shaped pacifiers first but she'll spit them out then I give her these and she takes it. Also, the glow-in- the-dark ones are great at night when she wakes up and starts to fuss. I can find it in the crib and pop it in and she goes right back to sleep. It'll glow for a few hours, usually. I can light it up in seconds with my phone flashlight too.",
