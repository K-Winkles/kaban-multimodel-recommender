            "Baby Pacifier - Natursutten's Medium Size natural rubber pacifiers are the perfect size for young infants and older babies 6-12 months. We also offer Small Size pacifiers for 0-6 months and Large Size pacis for 12 months and up. Need Pacifier Storage? Add our PaciPouch Pacifier Holder, 100% Organic Cotton and machine washable",
            "Safer and Softer - Our pacifiers are made exclusively from pure natural rubber from Hevea Brasiliensis trees. They are free of BPA, phthalates, and chemical softening agents. Each natural rubber pacifier is naturally softer than silicone pacifiers and gentle on sensitive gums",
            "Best Pacifier for Breastfed Babies - Ultimately, the best pacifier is the one your baby will take. We've found that better breastfeeding pacifiers feature a Round shield that gently rests upon baby's nose, which simulates breastfeeding. Similarly, a Round bulb nipple more closely mimics the natural breast, which reduces nipple confusion in breastfed babies",
            "Supporting Healthy Teeth and Breathing - Your baby may instead prefer a butterfly pacifier shield that leaves a cut-out to let their nose be free to wriggle around and breathe! They might also prefer an Orthodontic pacifier nipple, which is flat on the bottom and reduces stress on baby's bottom teeth and jaw",
            "One Piece Baby Pacifiers - Whichever binkie is right for your baby, all Natursutten pacifiers feature one-piece construction with no joints or cracks where dirt and other yucks can collect. They're also super easy to clean with mild soap and running water. Pediatricians recommend replacing a well-used or worn pacifier every 4-6 weeks."

These are perfect because they are his preferred shape but the rubber material is soft so if he rolls on it in the night he rarely notices and we all sleep better! The medium size is similar to the up to 6 months bibs pacifiers. Expensive but very high quality. No smell and only needs just a little soap and water to clean.",

                "reviewText": "We LOVE this paci! We have been using them for a little over a year now. We keep two in rotation at a time and they last us roughly two months before we need to change it out. I always keep four extra on hand, because sometimes I don\u2019t realize it is time to get a new one and need to replace it right then. And, oh goodness if we lose one in the car or the bed at night... I have an extra on hand until we can really look for it. With a walker now, she may hide them too and we will find it in a boot a week later...lol! We upped the size when my baby was about 3 months old. It took her a couple days to adjust to the new size, so if we have anymore children, I may wait a few more months. This is not an issue for price point because this is one of the only expenses we have for babies. We cloth diaper, breastfeed, and buy everything but car seats second hand, so this is a very minimal expense of $12 (sometimes on sale for $9!) a month. I really appreciate this brand! Side note: We use the rounded and her teeth look perfectly fine. The only child we have a pallet issue with is our thumb sucker, so I am in the minority on pro paci. We have never had a pallet issue with our paci takers because by 1/2-2 they are off the paci and that is easier to take away than a thumb.",

The moment i popped it into his mouth he started sucking away! The nipple size is absolutely perfect for him and expands with every sucking motion. At $12 and some change for a binky i did think it was very pricey for just one, but im very glad i spent the money because it\u2019s worth every penny! The pacifier is so soft and flexible so i don\u2019t have to worry about him rolling over on it and hurting himself in his crib. Overall i definitely love this product and will be buying another one for the diaper bag for sure! This one\u2019s a game changer!!",

                "reviewText": "I like this binky. I like the fact that it was made natural and the fact that it is one piece. It is of good quality. The only thing is my baby didn't like it. She got use to her other binkys. This binky mouth piece is not flat like other binkys. It has a more rounded feel to it, and it doesn't flatten out in babys mouth. I wish she would have liked it because I did. It is a five star binky but I gave it 4 only because my baby didn't like it and it is on the pricey side. Im always looking for a good one piece binky because I don't like feeling like pieces can come apart. Its really hard to find a one piece for a baby 6 months plus.Update: 2 months after my first review. My baby loves this binky now. I guess it took her some time to get use to it, but she loves it. She uses it for a night time binky because I feel safer knowing she has a one piece at night when I'm not able to supervise her binky usage. I'm so glad she loves it, so I gave 5 stars.",
