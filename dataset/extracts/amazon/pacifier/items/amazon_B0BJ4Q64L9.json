        "description": "The instinctive action of sucking helps to calm and soothe babies and all parents know theres nothing more wonderful than a calm, content baby. Little mouths dont always hold onto heavy baby pacifiers which means parents often need to replace the pacifier in their babys mouth every few minutes. Our Ultra-Light Silicone pacifier is our lightest ever pacifier and is light enough to stay put in babys mouth for longer helping babies to stay calmer, soothed and happier for longer. As the symmetrical silicone baglet is fully reversible, there is no wrong side-up so the pacifier will always be placed correctly in your babys mouth, even when they put it in their mouth themselves. The curved shield sits comfortably between babys chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect babys delicate skin against irritation. The smooth surface of silicone is very easy to clean and wont absorb stains and odors. The hygienic, anti-static properties prevent dust from settling and as it has a one-piece design, it is really easy to clean - simply pop in a sterilizer, wash by hand or in the top shelf of the dishwasher. We recommend that you replace the pacifier every month and always at the first signs of damage or weakness. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months*From an independent study in July 2021 of 416 moms with a 0-36m child, who are currently using a Tommee Tippee pacifier: *99% of moms would recommend a Tommee Tippee pacifier *97% of moms say a Tommee Tippee pacifier helped settle baby *93% of moms say babies love their Tommee Tippee pacifier 97.5% of babies accept a Tommee Tippee pacifier",

We finally switched to this bigger size just because we didn\u2019t want to risk choking but the smaller size lasted us 4 months and there were no signs of wear and tear.We bought 2 sets of these (because you can never have enough binkys). It helps soothe our baby on a daily basis and he is finally getting old enough where he can take it in and out of his mouth (by hand) as he pleases.It\u2019s also been a great aid in his teething phase. They are also super easy to clean and sterilize! Zero hassle.We love the colors because they are easy to find, the size and shape. They are so light weight and easy on baby\u2019s gums.We have never had a problem with these and highly recommend it to other families. ***It\u2019s so important to change the size of your binky so baby can\u2019t choke on it when they get older.",

They don't come with a spot to clip a pasi clip on to which would be a downfall except we just holepunched a little spot and they've worked great ever since. We are big fans and have ordered this pack a few times now.",

                "reviewText": "Holy crap. These pacifiers are amazing. This is our first night using them and I am typing this as my 6 month old is passed out and holding one of these in his mouth with ease. Not even a wiggle with a loosened grip! No slipping out and then jolting himself awake! He has used the avent soothies his entire life and then when he started shoving the whole things in his mouth it freaked my husband and i out enough to find him some new ones.. granted he was due for his big boy pacifier size anyways (little man actually turns 6 months next week). After doing way too much research because I'm overparanoid, I settled on trying out 2 new kinds since the avent super soothies are really hard and he has a difficult time holding them in his mouth without his hand being in front which isn't a good bedtime pacifier for us at all. We went with these guys and the chicco physioforma. I gave the kiddo one of each at bedtime before stories to give him some time to adjust to a new pacifier. Handed him the tommee first and he held it in there pretty good, but spit it when he saw the chicco. So I handed him that one and he just immediately started chewing on it like he does the super soothies, granted the chicco ones are nice because they are one piece of silicone, 4 big airholes, and have a nice handle so if he shoves it too far into his mouth, we have plenty to grab before he chokes himself. Anyways.. he ended up going back to the tommee tippee one and for the first time in his entire life he held the pacifier in his mouth with EASE. I'm talking 3 stories and 10 minutes of face to face time with giggles included and the thing didn't fall out. I like that it's also one piece of silicone (choking hazards are mostly always 2 or 3 piece pacifiers because the nipple detaches and goes down their throats. 1 piece pacifiers are only choking hazards once the baby has teeth and can rip apart the pacifier). It also has 2 nice big airholes on the sides and the choke guard is firmer than the nipple to the point that he can't bend it and shove the whole thing in his mouth as easily as he can with the soothies. I pulled the ol' switcheroo on him when he was dream feeding and he only tensed once I was out of his mouth and immediately passed out again when this pacifier went in (usually he will spit whatever pacifier we are trying that night and I'll have to calm him down and start the process over again). He was so content that after I laid him in his crib, he rolled to the edge so I PUSHED him back to the center of his bed and he didn't even flinch!! I am SOLD!! I finally found the perfect pacifier for my kiddo and I am so happy I could cry. If this thing stops my kiddo from needing me 3-4 times a night to put him back to sleep than I will be updating my review and buying A LOT more. We tried avent soothies, super soothies, BiBs natural rubber pacifiers, avent ultra soft and nuk and these are the only ones he has taken and kept in his mouth.",
