The teething handle is also great, easy for her to hold and she\u2019s been enjoying chewing on it. The material feels super sturdy so I don\u2019t have to worry about it breaking off. Also very easy to clean! Love the aesthetic of it all as well!",

My daughter is 20 months old and still likes a pacifier at night. The issue is she has a tendency to chew on her pacifier, sometimes breaking them. I had an issue with one of the pacifiers getting bitten into after only having it for a few days I wrote to the company asking if they had a different suggestion for another one of their products since the one I chose wasnt ideal for us, they replied back with their suggestion, and offered to send a cutie bit for free. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t sure anybody would even reply, but was pleasantly surprised when someone did. Not only were they understanding they were super friendly and genuinely helpful. I assured them because of how wonderful their customer service was I will be purchasing from them again. I will also keep them in mind for my family members who are expecting. Ryan & Rose Products are great and make the perfect gifts !",

                "reviewText": "My baby decided to be very picky when it came to pacifiers. I tried lots of different ones. She loved the mam orthodontic (flat) pacis to begin with but after seeing how they could get molded it bothered me! These are completely silicone and seem so much cleaner! I bought one to try and ended up buying more. My baby is missing the radius bones in her arms which affects her mobility so we also needed something more adaptable to allow her to grasp and pick up her own paci! This has been the best one for sure! Also convenient because it doubles as a teether!",
