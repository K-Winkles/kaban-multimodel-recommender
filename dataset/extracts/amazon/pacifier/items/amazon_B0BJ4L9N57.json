        "description": "The instinctive action of sucking helps to calm and soothe babies and all parents know theres nothing more wonderful than a calm, content baby. Little mouths dont always hold onto heavy baby pacifiers which means parents often need to replace the pacifier in their babys mouth every few minutes. Our Ultra-Light Silicone pacifier is our lightest ever pacifier and is light enough to stay put in babys mouth for longer helping babies to stay calmer, soothed and happier for longer. As the symmetrical silicone baglet is fully reversible, there is no wrong side-up so the pacifier will always be placed correctly in your babys mouth, even when they put it in their mouth themselves. The curved shield sits comfortably between babys chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect babys delicate skin against irritation. The smooth surface of silicone is very easy to clean and wont absorb stains and odors. The hygienic, anti-static properties prevent dust from settling and as it has a one-piece design, it is really easy to clean - simply pop in a sterilizer, wash by hand or in the top shelf of the dishwasher. We recommend that you replace the pacifier every month and always at the first signs of damage or weakness. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months*From an independent study in July 2021 of 416 moms with a 0-36m child, who are currently using a Tommee Tippee pacifier: *99% of moms would recommend a Tommee Tippee pacifier *97% of moms say a Tommee Tippee pacifier helped settle baby *93% of moms say babies love their Tommee Tippee pacifier 97.5% of babies accept a Tommee Tippee pacifier",

Like a lot of the other types of pacis do. Since they are all one solid piece, it makes it really easy to clean.",
