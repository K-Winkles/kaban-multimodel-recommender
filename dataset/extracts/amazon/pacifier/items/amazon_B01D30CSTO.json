It was a little smaller than I imagined but it works great if anything it\u2019s better it\u2019s on the smaller side so I\u2019m not worried about any suffocation hazard.

                "reviewText": "As a mom I love this product! It holds 3 pacis (one in a pocket to keep clean and two velcro onto the bunny hands). This is great because we\u2019ve all dropped a paci and needed a spare at some point. The animal is easy to machine wash & overall just super cute. I also LOVE that it\u2019s not big enough to be hazardous in the crib, but it is big enough so that it doesn\u2019t fall through the slats. Fallen pacis at night are no fun, and this product has saved us from that! Highly recommend!",

There are two places to hold your pacifier. Just think about the pacifier's your baby uses. If it doesn't have a whole or handle, it won't work for this lovey. It just so happens it doesn't work for most MAM pacifiers.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely LOVE this! The worst part about taking a binky out in public is the fear of it being dropped on the floor. This lovey has a POCKET to put the binky in and it is awesome. I usually tie one to the hand for use now and tie one to the fastener inside the pocket for later (just in case). I don't know why other pacifier holders haven't thought of this, but the pocket is genius! Also...machine washable which is a plus!",
