                "reviewText": "When my LO was born I had bought many pacifiers and pacifier clips. They worked all right, but I didn't really like how the strap was so long on the pacifier clip. If not attached properly the pacifier clip strap could get wrapped around the infants neck and that was something that constantly worried me. I decided to try out a Wubbanub pacifier, I bought the Wubbanub Bear (Pink) and immediately knew this would be my \"go to\" pacifier brand. I loved how the pacifier was attached to the super soft and adorable plush bear. Plus, I don't have to worry about any long straps that could possibly strangle my baby. The pacifier is sewn onto the plush which to me, makes finding the pacifier much easier when I am looking for one. We all know how hard it seems to be to find a pacifier when we need one the most. I recently ordered the Hippo and Confetti Bear and they are exactly what I expected them to be. I now have 3 and my LO loves them as much as I do. Such a great product and I highly recommend. They also make great gifts!",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE Wubbanub! Any parent who has attempted to dig a pacifier out from under her infant's butt in the car seat/off the backseat floorboards/out from between the seats or wherever it managed to fall to while listening to her child scream and simultaneously keeping her foot on the brake at that impossibly short red light recognizes the value of Wubbanub. Not only are they adorable (A-DOR-A-BLE!!) little critters, but they keep pacifiers accessible when the baby spits them out. I can find the Wubbanub behind my back in the dark while driving and preserve what's left of my sanity while replugging the (really cute and very much loved) baby. Because it keeps the pacifier relatively secure, he has even found it again himself even though he is too young to have the fine motor skills to pick it up. These will be my go-to baby shower gift for the rest of my life!",

                "reviewText": "My daughter is 17 months old and obsessed with this. I know i know out of the recommended age group but some babies have blankies or teddy bears they attach to, she attached to this. Only the hippo and she calls it hiphop. She does use the binky to sleep at night but it's more about the stuffy at this point. It was great when she was little because they don't fall out of the crib like a binky and much easier for her to find on her own in the dark. Cleaning them i haven't really figured out because the binky is attached so i keep having to buy new ones and hoping she does't notice. She has two at all times. I've never had one year or detach either and she's rough on them.",

                "reviewText": "My daughter, almost 1, has used only WubbaNubs since she was born. About 15 years ago I stumbled upon a duck WubbaNub at a local baby boutique and got it for a newborn cousin; at the time, only the duck and red puppy were available, and my cousin toted them with her everywhere for years. She adored them. When I found out I was pregnant, the choice of binky for my new arrival was simple. Between my mother and I my daughter has probably 15+ WubbaNub (we're in deep and like collecting the different animals) and is a certified addict. Sometimes she'll have one in her mouth and carry another in her hand and periodically switch. I've bought her the Soothie pacifiers only to keep in case of emergency in the car or diaper bag and while those binks are okay, they are in no way equal to the real deal with the attached animals. I toss them in the washer in a lingere bag when they start to look grubby and they come out clean every time. My daughter can find these in her crib when 3/4s asleep in the dark, a real lifesaver. Stroking the stuffed animal body helps her relax, and sometimes simply holding it in her hands without putting the pacifier part into her mouth is all she needs to calm down. I recommend WubbaNubs to all expecting moms I know. My personal favorite is the penguin but hers is this hippo. :)",
