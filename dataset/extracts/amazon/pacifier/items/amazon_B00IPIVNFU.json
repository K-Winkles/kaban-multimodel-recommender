                "reviewText": "This is the only pacifier that my two-year-old has ever used, ever since we had a 'bink' emergency and pulled out the 6-9 month ones we'd been given as a shower gift. I've tried substituting other binks that are almost identical in size, Avent, Gerber, Tommy Tippee, and at the very least he holds onto it, with his Mam, and treats it like a toy. Other than his occasional chewing on them and creating holes they've always held up well. Silicone is thick, we recently graduated to the 16 month + which is slightly larger. Almost can't tell but it is. Hard to find these under $3.50 but you get what you pay for, especially with baby items. Mommy LOVES the sterilizer box, so very handy for quick sterilizing especially when they grow older and you no longer need to sterilize EVERYTHING. If you get a minute, (what's that, right?!\ud83e\udd23), definitely check out the website. Super sweet and loving, an all around good company! My only complaint is that I wish they were more available in stores, in a bigger selection. When the stores have them, it seems like it's usually the nighttime glow-in-the-dark model. Hey, after a while tho, u no longer notice, or care, that your kid constantly has a 'beddie bye bink' with the moon & stars that glows!",

(or as i call them, bubble sides!). hope you like this review and i cannot say enough about it! thank you mam, and amazon.",
