A lot of her items in her bedroom are unicorn themed so this was a perfect addition to her belongings.It\u2019s a super cute unicorn and pink pacifier set. It\u2019s also nice because it\u2019s harder to lose the pacifier with the unicorn attached to it. Also it\u2019s less likely to roll off of her into the floor because the weight of the unicorn helps with that. Would recommend these pacifiers.",
