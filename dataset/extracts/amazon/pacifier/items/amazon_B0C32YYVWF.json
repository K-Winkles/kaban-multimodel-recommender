                "reviewText": "This is the only shape pacifier that my breastfed daughter (6 weeks old) somewhat takes. We were using the Avent soothies, but they would drop out of her mouth easily. I bought these thinking they might stay in her mouth longer. So far, she takes them about the same as the soothie. It stays in her mouth slightly longer. The Jollypop seems lighter and has a slightly smaller nipple. Overall, the Jollypop seems like good quality. The soothie seems a bit softer all around, but I like how the Jollypop fits around my daughter's face. I'm curious to see if she will take these better in time and if she seems to prefer one over the other. Worth a try!",
