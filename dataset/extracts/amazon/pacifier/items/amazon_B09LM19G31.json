                "reviewText": "\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50I absolutely adore the FRIGG Rope Natural Rubber Baby Pacifiers! This is my third time purchasing these pacifiers, and each time I'm impressed by their quality and design. The fact that they are made in Denmark and BPA-free gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm providing my little one with a safe and reliable product.The Silver Gray/French Gray color combination is both stylish and gender-neutral, perfect for any baby. The 6-18 months size fits my little one perfectly, and I appreciate the range of sizes available to accommodate growing babies.The natural rubber material is soft and gentle on my baby's delicate skin, and the rope handle adds a unique touch while also making it easy to attach pacifier clips. These pacifiers are not only practical but also stylish and functional.Overall, I highly recommend the FRIGG Rope Natural Rubber Baby Pacifiers to any parent looking for a high-quality, safe, and stylish pacifier for their little one. They have quickly become a favorite in our household!",
