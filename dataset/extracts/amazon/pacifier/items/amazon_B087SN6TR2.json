        "description": "MAM Comfort newborn pacifiers have a one-piece construction made of 100% silicone, and are on average 36% lighter* than other competitive one-piece pacifiers for breastfed babies. The lightweight design and extra small nipple is very well-accepted by babies and is optimally adapted to the special needs of newborn boys and girls. The extra soft shield has four large air holes to ensure baby's sensitive skin stays dry and comfortable, while the unique MAM shape leaves plenty of room for baby's nose to breathe. The convenient handle is great for attaching a clip to keep baby's silicone pacifier always in reach. Sterilize baby's MAM pacifier in the microwave using the convenient MAM self- sterilizing storage case: Fill pacifier case with water. Place pacifier in the sterilizing case with the nipple facing down. Follow Start Pacifier package instructions for microwave setting. Cool completely before use. Pacifiers kept in the closed box will remain disinfected for up to 48 hours. *Scientific reports from the WILD Hi-Precision Institute (Austria) confirm that the MAM Comfort is 36% lighter than the average weight of all other tested one-piece silicone pacifiers. Measured weight results: 8.2 g \u2013 18.6 g",

This was the only pacifier she would take, even being a breastfed baby. I love that they are easy to clean, and we also toss them in the sanitizer as well. The simple design is also nice in comparison to the other MAM styles.",

They are much smaller and more round. I would have kept them and tried them anyway except that my baby is starting to grow out of the smaller size binkie, and this would certainly have been too small. I was unable to find these in a bigger size so I guess I'm going have to hunt around for a similar pacifier brand that's fully silicone. So disappointing.",
