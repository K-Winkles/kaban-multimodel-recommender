I bought her this so that she can hold onto it and put it back in herself while in the car or falling asleep (which she's working on :)) The material of the \"monster\" is very soft. The pacifier is attatched very strongly to the plush. Its cute and I hope she continues to use it. To clean I just wipe the plush with a damp cloth with a tiny bit of dish soap and wash the pacifier with soap and hot water then let air dry. We may purchase more in the future if needed.",

It's nice to have a binky that won't get lost, since it's stuck to a soft purple monster. Not only is it easy for my baby to hold, and stays with her when she's bundled, but friends/neighbors/family members always know if we've misplaced our binky. :)",

                "reviewText": "Both of my daughter\u2019s have used these and we absolutely love them. We would swaddle them with these tucked in right by their mouths so they were right there when they spit them out and we no longer had to get up in the middle of the night to put it back in their mouth when they were tiny. My youngest was able to put it back in her mouth by the time she was 2 months old. They are so much easier to find when dropped and so easy to clean. I just throw them in the washing machine with a load of clothes and then hand wash the pacifier. They dry super fast and are dry enough straight from the washer that when they were older I would just hand them back. Between the two of them we\u2019ve probably bought at least 20. I love them as much as they do. Ha ha! I always give as gifts and my friends have all liked them as much as we do.",
