        "description": "A LUXE-urious pacifier that soothes babies, and parents alike! The PhysioForma Luxe Orthodontic Pacifier is a one-piece, 100% soft silicone pacifier with a softly textured shield and handle. Parents love that these pacifiers not only soothe but also provide benefits for baby\u2019s breathing and orthodontic development.Parents love that PhysioForma pacifiers were developed, tested, and approved in partnership with an advisory panel of leading neonatologists, pediatricians, and orthodontists. The exclusive nipple design helps position the tongue forward to maintain an open airway and support baby\u2019s physiological breathing. This is especially important at bedtime where it can help improve sleep quality and reduce irritability. Tiny ridges and an inclined nipple shape guide proper tongue placement while the unique angle and lateral curve of the nipple evenly distribute tongue pressure across the palate. Together, these important features support baby\u2019s growing palate and orthodontic development. PhysioForma pacifiers adhere to the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics and are accepted by 9 out of 10 babies.Babies love that the nipple is made from extra-soft, velvety silicone and has a satin-textured finish that helps baby keep the paci in their mouth for uninterrupted soothing. The just-like mom, skin-like feel is also ideal for breast-fed babies. Multiple ventilation holes promote air circulation and help reduce moisture buildup on baby\u2019s soft, sensitive skin. Plus, the textured shield gently soothes baby during teething and the easy-to-grab handle is just the right size for either baby or parent to hold. Luxe pacifiers come in a variety of tones and textures from trending opaque shades to a crystal clear jewel-like finish. Choose from three sizes: 0-6m, 6-16m, or 16-24m. A reusable, sterilizing/carry case is also included.",
