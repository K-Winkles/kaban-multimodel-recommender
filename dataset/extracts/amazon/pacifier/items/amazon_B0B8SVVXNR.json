        "description": "The instinctive action of sucking helps to calm and soothe babies and all parents know theres nothing more wonderful than a calm, content baby. Our night time pacifiers feature ingenious glow in the dark handles, so parents can locate the pacifier in a dark room without having to disturb baby. As the symmetrical silicone baglet is fully reversible, there is no wrong side-up so the pacifier will always be placed correctly in your babys mouth, even when they put it in their mouth themselves. The curved shield sits comfortably between babys chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect babys delicate skin against irritation. The BPA-free silicone baglet is soft and flexible whilst also being robust and durable. The smooth surface of silicone is very easy to clean and wont absorb stains and odors. Simply pop in a sterilizer, wash by hand or in the dishwasher. We recommend that you replace the pacifier every month and always at the first signs of damage or wear. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months. *From an independent study in July 2021 of 416 moms with a 0-36m child, who are currently using a Tommee Tippee pacifier: **99% of moms would recommend a Tommee Tippee pacifier **97% of moms say a Tommee Tippee pacifier helped settle baby **93% of moms say babies love their Tommee Tippee pacifier **97.5% accepted a Tommee Tippee pacifier Warning! Do not tie pacifier around childs neck as it presents a strangulation danger.",

                "reviewText": "My eldest kids never really liked pacifiers. Now the AAP recommends them as a way to help prevent SIDS (shown in peer-reviewed journal articles) and no, I am not making any claims that by buying this product you will prevent SIDS. It's what the AAP recommends. That's it. Like they recommend babies sleep on their back, right?I recommend these because those stupid hospital binkies are horrible and hard for the baby to keep in their mouth because there is no side. I told my sister to buy these for her new baby. Her boyfriend disagreed and wanted to use the one from the hospital. I told him. Now he's buying these and went in the middle of the night to be sure he had a Tommee Tippee for his baby.My youngest babies will not use any other binky. Elder of the kids spit out every other kind. This was round six or so of trying binkies. Worked like a charm. Works like a charm for my new baby. I won't buy or recommend any other brand. They are a waste of money and your baby might not like you for giving them a binky they don't like.",
