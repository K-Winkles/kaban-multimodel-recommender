                "reviewText": "Nothing is wrong with the product itself, but as a first time mom I didn\u2019t know that the nipple would be harder when you age up in pacifiers. My daughter is 6 months and just started taking a pacifier and she will only use the one from the hospital or the itzy ritzy brand because of the nipples being the same shape and they are soft. I ordered these to have an extra set for her daycare and she chews on it because of it being hard and if she does latch on, it falls right out because the nipple is shorter than the one from the hospital. So for now she will stick to the ones that are softer and they say the age range is 0-3 months but it\u2019s what she likes. I will introduce the harder pacifiers to her when she starts to get teeth and possibly starts to chew holes in her pacifiers.Update:My daughter just turned 1 and is using these pacifiers with no problem. I introduced them to her again and at first she would suck for a second and then chew on the nipple but after a few minutes she used it successfully. Yes dog hair or anything will stick to the silicone pacifiers but that literally happens with any pacifier. Comes off just fine with wipes or running it under some water.",
