                "reviewText": "Our new son when he is fussy likes to sleep with a pacifier. I had some concerns about our son utilizing the pacifier, but upon doing a lot of research I do not see any reason for him not to use one. The problem was that it would fall out, he would cry, and mom or dad would have to get up put the pacifier in many times a night. As sleep deprived new parents getting up every few hours to feed him, this routine got old real fast. The problem is the infant pacifier that we started using when we came home from the hospital kept falling out and down next to him. He would start to cry. Put it back in and happy baby.This was a wonderful find!My wife found this and purchased one. It worked wonderfully. If it falls out of the baby's mouth and you have the baby on the back as almost every baby sleep expert recommends, the pacifier will stay on the baby's chest. The baby can then put it back in at will.I did have a concern about if the baby wanted to remove the pacifier if this would somehow be a suffocation threat Because the stuffed animal would prevent the pacifier from coming out. Watching our baby utilize it became very obvious that if the baby no longer wants the pacifier in his mouth he can easily spit it out with it still staying on his chest even if swaddled.Another plus is that if you are holding the baby you can hold the bottom of the stuffed animal across the baby's chest and you do not have to worry about the pacifier falling out and hitting the floor.This was a wonderful find that I highly recommend to any parents want to keep a pacifier from falling. As a bonus, the stuffed animals are cute, and we got a lot of compliments from people about how cute our baby looked with the pacifier.Update: Our son is 15th months old, and this is the only thing besides the diaper genie that we are still using that I can think of since he was born. We love this product. We did buy an extra, and it looks like 2 is all we will need until it is time to transition away from a pacifier.Update our son is 3, and when he was 2 my wife went through a ritual where he cut the pacifier of the stuffed animal after we weaned him away from using it. He still sleeps with both of the WubbaNubs each night. My wife is pregnant, so we will be purchasing two more. This would be one of the top 10 things cool things my wife and I would recommend to new parents.Update: we now have a second baby girl, and she has two of these and we have had the same positive results. Many complements on the cuteness of the stuffed animal. it was easy for both babies to keep the pacifier at a convenient location even when swaddled. By using any elastic clip, was also easy to prevent the pacifier from falling. My son is now five, and he still interacts with both of his that we removed the pacifier a few years ago. This is one of the most positive purchases we had with our new child right up there with the Diaper Genie.",

                "reviewText": "Y'all.This dog.It's everything.My baby adores this thing. It goes with him everywhere and can calm him down with a power I myself do not possess or pretend to understand. It's been lugged across states, banned from daycare (\"Please send a different pacifier. He cries when this one comes out of his mouth.\" I mean, yeah...that's kind of the point of the pacifier...right?), called back into action at daycare (\"Please send the dog pacifier back. We need it.\" Darn right you do. I told you!), washed in the washer, run through the dishwasher, thrown out of the crib in fits of rage, and snuggled constantly for the last six months. We ultimately had to buy another one so we could have a backup just in case this poor Wubby ever actually falls apart...which it is showing no signs of doing so far, mind you.We got the elephant Wubbanub too - BIG. MISTAKE. Something about the weight of the puppy's limbs helps keep it in place and makes it easier for my son to lug around and get into his mouth. It never gets lost, which was a problem with a lot of our other pacifier attempts; the attached stuffed animal makes it handy to find for the baby and for us. Our boy is now completely independent at using this pacifier; I've watched him search for it to soothe himself while I held my breath from this end of the video monitor, hoping he'd pop this guy in his mouth and head back to dreamland. Success.It's now a go-to gift for all my friends when I found out they are expecting. They're all like, \"Oh, so cute,\" as they pile it up with their other gifts. And it is. Cute, I mean. But just you wait, friends - you'll thank me for this guy later.",

                "reviewText": "I honestly don't know how I made it through my first two kids without one of these!! They are great for so many reasons: 1. They are easy to find, and don't get lost - I have exclusively used one binky for the last 5 months compared to the dozens I had gone through with my other two kids by the same time, saving $$ as well! (They are also much easier to find than just a single little binky in the dark or in the car!) 2. My baby has learned how to put his own binky in his mouth MONTHS earlier than my others did. Since it is so much bigger - much less dexterity and coordination is necessary to get it in his own mouth! 3. It STAYS in place. This is the kicker for me. Especially as a newborn, before they really have the suction power to keep their binky in - when they spit out their bink half-way, it doesn't fall out completely = less trips for mom and dad to put it back in their mouth! 4. Although this is just anticipation, when it's time to wean off of the binky, I think it will be much easier to just cut off the actual binky and let them play with the animal for comfort. Hopefully it will be an easier transition by letting them keep some of what they have become attached to.After 5 months of constant use, our binky is starting to tear where it is stitched to the animal. Honestly, this does not concern me at all given the fact that we use it all the time. If I only need one binky every 5-6 months, I'm one happy mama!",

It was so helpful when she was just a newborn, she would spit the normal binky out. We would be up all night taking turns holding the binky in her mouth. I found this little guy and what a lifesaver.
