                "reviewText": "We always have a few different types of pacifiers on hand when we bring our littles home from the hospital. I love that we can attach a pacifier clip to the FRIGG pacifiers so we don\u2019t lose it and our newborn can have it close by if she wants it.I also love the natural rubber & bulb shape\u2014 our babies seem to prefer these over other conventional pacifier shapes. Not to mention, they are the cutest little pacifiers, sturdy, and well made. So they are also perfect if you\u2019re taking newborn portraits and your baby prefers to have a pacifier when they\u2019re sleeping or if they need extra soothing during the shoot.",
