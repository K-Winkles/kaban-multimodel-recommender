        "description": "NUK Airflow Pacifiers have a unique shape that enables 3 times more airflow to prevent irritation on baby\u2019s sensitive skin. The glow-in-the-dark button allows parents and babies to easily find the pacifier at night. To activate the glow-in-the-dark feature, simply expose the pacifier to light for two minutes until the button glows green. Like all NUK pacifiers, Airflow glow-in-the-dark pacifiers feature the improved NUK orthodontic nipple shape that best promotes healthy oral development. NUK\u2019s asymmetrical nipple naturally fits baby\u2019s palate and allows more room for a natural sucking motion, reducing pressure on teeth and jaw, and helping prevent teeth misalignment. The NUK pacifier is modeled after the natural shape of mom\u2019s nipple while breastfeeding, making for an easy transition from breast to pacifier and back. The heart-shaped shield fits perfectly under baby\u2019s nose for easier breathing and less irritation.",

The fact that these glow make it easy for him to find on his own and easy for me to find if he knocks them out of his crib. He also likes how big the nipple part on these are.

                "reviewText": "Get these glow in the dark pacifiers! Often the Nuk ones come in a package that say glow in the dark and then only 1 in 3 or 2 in 5 are actually glow in the dark. These are 2 for 2. They glow really well and are otherwise the same as regular Nuk pacifiers. They are a little easier to wash - the soapy water doesn\u2019t get stuck in the nipple part as much as with the others, so an added bonus. They also have a handle so if you need to attach a strap you can (when they\u2019re not being used in the crib)",
