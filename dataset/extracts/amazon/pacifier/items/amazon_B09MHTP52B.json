There are enough hat stickers for a large group of kids to play (we had over 13 kids take a turn). We did have a couple kids stick the hats to the wall instead of the poster and the stickers came off the wall without leaving a mark. Overall, I would highly recommend for any kitty cat birthday party :)",

That\u2019s tiny.\u201d I totally understand. Many of the \u201cpin the tail on the\u2026.\u201d games are so small the kids and adults who play the game struggle to even have the fun of playing the game. This game is a fan favorite for parties at our house so we have had a lot of pin the tail on anything and everything theme related for quite some time. This is honestly the first one that didn\u2019t really disappoint! The \u201cgame board\u201d poster itself is actually poster size and we happily put something up that seemed to be designed to actually play the game on. It was great. I would say it was the best one we have ever purchased. Highly recommend.",
