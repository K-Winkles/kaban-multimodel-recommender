        "description": "The instinctive action of sucking helps to calm and soothe babies and all parents know there\u2019s nothing more wonderful than a calm, content baby. So, when you need to turn screams and sobs into smiles and sleep, simply pick up a Tommee Tippee Fun Style pacifier. As the symmetrical silicone baglet is fully reversible, there is no \u2018wrong\u2019 side-up so the pacifier will always be placed correctly in your baby\u2019s mouth, even when they put it in their mouth themselves. The curved shield sits comfortably between baby\u2019s chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect baby\u2019s delicate skin against irritation. The BPA-free silicone baglet is soft and flexible whilst also being robust and durable. The smooth surface of silicone is very easy to clean and won\u2019t absorb stains and odors. Simply pop in a sterilizer, wash by hand or in the dishwasher. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months. *From an independent study in July 2021 of 416 moms with a 0-36m child, who are currently using a Tommee Tippee pacifier: *99% of moms would recommend a Tommee Tippee pacifier *97% of moms say a Tommee Tippee pacifier helped settle baby *93% of moms say babies love their Tommee Tippee pacifier *97.5% of babies accept a Tommee Tippee pacifier Warning! Do not tie pacifier around child\u2019s neck as it presents a strangulation danger",

How often should I replace my baby\u2019s pacifier? In the interests of hygiene, we recommend that you change your baby\u2019s pacifier every month. Always check the pacifier before each use and replace at the first signs of damage or weakness.

I purchased these like not even a month ago and my son had put holes in all of them and there\u2019s 6 sooo it really isn\u2019t working for my son anymore because they aren\u2019t that cheap and they get gross and harbor a bunch of germs etc after a hole is punctured through. Other than that this is a great brand and really the only brand my son and daughter took out of every other paci. Just be mindful when you see them chewing or if they tend to grind their teeth and night just to check the paci often for holes.",

                "reviewText": "As a parent of a toddler, I am always on the lookout for high-quality baby products that are not only safe but also fun and appealing to my little one. The Tommee Tippee Fun Style Soothers have truly exceeded my expectations, and they have become an essential part of our daily routine.**Design and Style:**The first thing that caught my attention was the adorable and colorful designs of these pacifiers. The pack of 6 dummies comes in a variety of fun and playful patterns, making them attractive to children. My toddler was immediately drawn to them, which made the transition from breastfeeding to using a pacifier much smoother.**Age-Appropriate Size:**These soothers are specifically designed for children aged 18 to 36 months, and I must say they are the perfect size for my little one. They fit comfortably in my child's mouth without causing any discomfort or irritation. The shield is also appropriately sized, preventing any choking hazards while ensuring safety during use.**Quality and Durability:**I have been using these pacifiers for several months now, and I am impressed with their durability. Despite daily use and occasional drops, they have held up remarkably well. The silicone nipple has not shown any signs of wear and tear, and the materials used in construction appear to be of high quality.**Easy to Clean:**Keeping the pacifiers clean is crucial, and I'm happy to report that these soothers are a breeze to clean. They can be easily sterilized using boiling water or a sterilizer, and they are also dishwasher-safe. The smooth surface of the pacifiers makes cleaning a quick task, saving me time and effort.**Child's Comfort:**One of the most important aspects of a pacifier is its ability to soothe and comfort a child. The Tommee Tippee Fun Style Soothers have been a lifesaver during fussy times and nap routines. The soft silicone nipple mimics the feel of breastfeeding, providing comfort to my little one and helping him to relax and fall asleep peacefully.**Value for Money:**Considering that this pack comes with six soothers, the price is more than reasonable. The quality, durability, and design justify the cost, and having multiple pacifiers in rotation ensures that we always have a clean one ready when needed.**Final Verdict:**In conclusion, the Tommee Tippee Fun Style Soothers have been a fantastic addition to our baby essentials collection. Their cute designs, age-appropriate size, and overall quality make them an excellent choice for toddlers aged 18 to 36 months. If you're a parent looking for reliable, safe, and visually appealing pacifiers for your little one, I highly recommend giving these soothers a try. They have made a positive impact on my child's comfort and happiness, and I'm sure they will do the same for yours.",

Inoltre il silicone del ciuccio ha una maggiore resistenza al rosicchiamento del bambino avendo una durata maggiore rispetto anche ad altre marche pi\u00f9 blasonate.FUNZIONALE Il ciuccio offre una comoda adattabilit\u00e0 tra il naso e il mento e i fori grandi consentono il passaggio di un flusso d'aria maggiore evitando l'accumulo di umidit\u00e0.Non posso che non consigliare questo prodotto, considerando anche il prezzo posso affermare che \u00e8 un prodotto di buona qualit\u00e0 al giusto prezzo.Infatti questo prodotto l'ho comprato pi\u00f9 volte.",
