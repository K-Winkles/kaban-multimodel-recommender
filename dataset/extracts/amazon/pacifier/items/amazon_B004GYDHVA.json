We had to use a pacifier when he was born to train him to keep his tongue down when sucking to eat. And I love the design of these because they allow their noses to no be crushed when sucking on them, unlike the bigger rounder ones you get at the hospital, that are heavy and constantly fall out of their mouth.Naturally almost 4 years later I had to find the same ones for my daughter and they worked like a charm. I also like that you attach them to a pacifier clip so they don\u2019t fall on the floor all the time. I am now having my third child and can\u2019t not find these in the stores, so I am so glad I was able to get them on amazon!",

                "reviewText": "I tried almost every pacifier on the market. I wanted my LO to use the Nattursutten pacifier because it's made of all natural rubber and is one piece (no space or hole for bacterial growth) but even though I purchased the butterfly shape, it was so big that it covered my LO's nose. And my LO is quite large for his age so it wasn't because of his size. Other moms complain about the same design flaw, too.My second choice was the Gumdrop pacifier because although it isn't made of the same high quality material as the Nattursutten, it was one piece so again, no holes for bacteria to grow in. But the pacifier was so heavy that my LO couldn't keep it in his mouth and I didn't want my LO to have to use so much force when using a binky. Just logically speaking, I would think the LO's jaws would hurt from holding something so heavy for so long.So then I tried Advent and Dr. Brown which were lighter in weight but also covered the nostrils.I ended up using MAMS pacifiers only because they were super lightweight and didn't obstruct my LO's breathing at all. But they are a pain to clean- the part that the LO sucks on is hollow so soap and spit get stuck in there. After awhile, it turned murky in color despite my obsessive washing.As soon as my LO was older, I again tried the Nattersutten. Still same problem- covered his entire nose. Back to Gumdrop and thank goodness, this time, my LO was able to hold it in his mouth on the first try.I'm still not 100% satisfied with it because I don't understand why it needs to be so heavy and why the nipple is hollow (makes cleaning a pain). Oh and the design makes LO look like Hannibal Lecter. It's a bit disturbing to me. Haha. But for now, my concern about bacteria growth in the MAMS binkies outweighs these issues.Until Nattersutten creates a pacifier with a deeper dip in the nostril area, I recommend the Gumdrop version.",

                "reviewText": "When we first brought our baby home, we used the Soothie brand pacifier so my poor chest could get a break. :) I liked those pacifiers because they were all one piece, soft, and easy to sterilize and clean. I tried the MAM pacifier once and the first time I washed it, a whole bunch of soapy water sucked into the nipple part and all I could imagine was my baby sucking on soap water, and milky drool getting caught in there to mold forever. My baby seemed to love the soothies. (Seriously, I love the eyes rolling back, \"hits the spot\" look she gets when she enjoys a good pacifier.) My husband, the worriest of worts, was concerned that the soothies were pushing her nose back and would give her a piggy nose, so he bought these. They are the same shape as the soothie and all one piece, and she accepted them easily and her little nose gets to, well, breathe. :) And the price is right!",

                "reviewText": "Thought that our baby would like these, but like any new parent you go through quite a few brands of anything baby, trying to find something that works, from pacifiers to socks. We tried different brands of pacifiers: Nuk, Dr. Brown, Gumdrops, and Avent. Nuk and Dr. Brown she was okay with. She would take them every once in a while when the mood strikes, more so Dr. Browns than Nuk. These Gumdrops she didn't like. For a first time mom it was entertaining to be able to see the sucking motion through the translucent opening of the Gumdrop pacifier, it was almost hypnotizing. But babies don't care if they are entertaining you or not. Our baby just spat this one out. It is quite hard and that may be why she doesn't like it. Right now she seems to have taken to the Avent Classic pacifier.I would have liked her to take the Gumdrop. Instead of multiple parts put together the Gumdrops are all one piece. But babies are all different. I gave it three stars as it probably works for some baby, just not mine. It's just a matter of preference.",

She liked them but I didn't like how they were fully round and covered her nose. I searched and searched until I found these. I really liked the colors, especially the purple. I was worried that she wouldn't like these as much but she took to them just as well as the first ones. They really help soothe her as she's falling asleep. Now, she's almost out of the 0-3 month stage and I will be purchasing the next size up in this brand.",
