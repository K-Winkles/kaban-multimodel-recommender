                "reviewText": "Amazingly Soft and flexible! 10,000 times better than the Mam pacifier holder!I bought these because I have several baby carriers with custom, matching wrap conversion pacifier holders. I had several mam pacifier holders but apparently they are NOT true silicone and will not hold up in to steam from an electric baby sterilizer. They literally shriveled up into a ball and was unrecognizable! I bought these as replacements since I needed at least 6. I was SO happy with these pacifier holders! They are true silicone! They are super soft and flexible! They fit perfectly in the button of the mam pacifier. They also stretch really well so they fit on both my thicker WC & thinner WC custom pacifier holders! These are WAY better made than the OEM holders I was replacing! I am super happy with these silicone pacifier holders and highly recommend them!",

These work well, hold the pacifier just fine, and he can't take the pacifier off the lanyard. I also used one to make my own wub-a-nub/pacifier buddy since I couldn't find those that easily fit MAM.",

My son only likes the MAM pacifiers, but the clips they offer are big and bulky plus the actual clip part that attaches to clothes does not work well. I love these pacifier clips the plastic clip is small and holds very well, but because of the way they attach to the paci we couldn't use them with the MAM pacifiers. With these silicone holders we now can!! They are soft silicone so they don't push into my baby's face at all and I can turn them to face whichever way works best at that moment. We soaked them in hot (not boiling just hot from the faucet) water and then washed them with the bottle soap. Do not steam them or any thing like that. You will definitely melt them.",

Unfortunately I haven't been able to find a binky clip with a metal clip the accommodates the MAM brand binkies (only kind my daughter will take). These \"adapters\" totally solved that problem! I can attach these to the binky clips that I have and like with ease. We have had zero issues with them.",
