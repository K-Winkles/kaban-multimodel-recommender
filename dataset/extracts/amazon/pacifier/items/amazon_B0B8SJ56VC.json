        "description": "The instinctive action of sucking helps to calm and soothe babies and all parents know theres nothing more wonderful than a calm, content baby. So, when you need to turn screams and sobs into smiles and sleep, simply pick up a Tommee Tippee Fun Style pacifier. As the symmetrical silicone baglet is fully reversible, there is no wrong side-up so the pacifier will always be placed correctly in your babys mouth, even when they put it in their mouth themselves. The curved shield sits comfortably between babys chin and nose and the holes in each side allow extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect babys delicate skin against irritation. The BPA-free silicone baglet is soft and flexible whilst also being robust and durable. The smooth surface of silicone is very easy to clean and wont absorb stains and odors. Simply pop in a sterilizer, wash by hand or in the dishwasher. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months. *From an independent study in July 2021 of 416 moms with a 0-36m child, who are currently using a Tommee Tippee pacifier: *99% of moms would recommend a Tommee Tippee pacifier *97% of moms say a Tommee Tippee pacifier helped settle baby *93% of moms say babies love their Tommee Tippee pacifier *97.5% of babies accept a Tommee Tippee pacifier Warning! Do not tie pacifier around childs neck as it presents a strangulation danger.",

How often should I replace my baby\u2019s pacifier? In the interests of hygiene, we recommend that you change your baby\u2019s pacifier every month. Always check the pacifier before each use and replace at the first signs of damage or weakness.

But these are the ONLY ONES he likes!",

Easy for him to put into his mouth by himself and direction doesn\u2019t matter.They\u2019re not as easy to wash as the previous binkies we had that don\u2019t go past 6 months. They are not one solid piece so if you dish washer or submerged them they get filled with water and you have to try hard to get it out so you obviously don\u2019t get mold or anything.That results in us simply not washing them as often as I\u2019d like which is a bummer.They also seem to get that weird annoying film that the bottle nipples also get from time to time.",
