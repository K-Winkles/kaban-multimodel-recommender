When moms breast isnt available, our Breast-like pacifier is the next best thing for baby to latch onto in between feeds. This pacifier glows in the dark for up to 8 hours which allows parents to locate the pacifier in a dark room without having to disturb baby. During the day your pacifier will recharge in natural light.Inspired by our award-winning Closer to Nature nipple, this super soft silicone pacifier feels, moves, flexes and stretches just like skin so theres less chance of confusion when feeding baby from breast or bottle - perfect if youre worried that offering your baby a pacifier may disrupt breast or bottle feeding. As the symmetrical silicone baglet is fully reversible, there is no wrong side-up so the pacifier will always be placed correctly in your babys mouth, even when they put it in their mouth themselves. The pacifier shield curves away from babys face and offers superior ventilation and extra air flow and prevent the build-up of moisture which helps to protect babys delicate skin against irritation.We recommend that you replace the pacifier every month and always at the first signs of damage or weakness. We recommend stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months.*as compared to traditional round unvented pacifiers which do not compress as easily.",

Always BPA and phthalate-free for your ultimate reassurance. How often should I replace my baby\u2019s pacifier? In the interests of hygiene, we recommend that you change your baby\u2019s pacifier every month. Always check the pacifier before each use and replace at the first signs of damage or weakness. We recommend against prolonged pacifier use over 24 months and stopping pacifier use when your child is older than 36 months.",
