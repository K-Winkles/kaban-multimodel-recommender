                "reviewText": "These are the same quality found at local big box stores. Mam pacifiers have been a go to in my house for all 3 of my babies. I was intrigued to find this thinner, teeth friendly design for my 9 month old. There was a little bit of push back from the slight change of nipple shape, but with a little patience and persistence my little guys transitioned fine. The design makes sense for less teeth shifting, however time will tell. I would honestly buy the original mam pacifiers if these weren't available, but I am oh so glad that they offer a more conscious design like this!",

He was hooked on the newborn ones, and now again with these. We have at least 4-6 around the house. Now he has 8 teeth, chews on them, throws them around and they hold up great. The flat part is great for babes with teeth! There is no other pacifier made as well as MAM, in my opinion.",

I think they are easy to clean (especially with the included case). My LO didn't seem to have any problems transitioning to these at all.I will say that due to the design sometimes LO's lips seem to press through the pacifier? I'm not sure how else to describe it -- because it's such a minimal design, when LO sucks on the nipple her lips squish past. Doesn't seem to bother her at all, but it does mess me up a little. I would buy these again though!",
