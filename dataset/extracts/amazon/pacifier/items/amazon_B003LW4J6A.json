        "description": "This is a single pack of an orthodontic 0 to 6 month pacifier. Ecopiggy Ecopacifier is the preferred natural rubber pacifier. Sustainably made from 100% natural rubber, from the tree Hevea Brasiliensis, ecopacifier is softer and more natural than artificial silicone. Our round shield lightly touches the child's nose, simulating the soothing feel of breast feeding. Ecopacifier's single-piece design ensures no small pieces to gather dirt and germs, and no small pieces means no choking hazards. Ecopiggy natural rubber pacifiers are made without chemical softeners or colorants, and are BPA-Free, Phthalate-Free, PVC-Free, and Paraben-Free. Children love the natural soothing effects of Ecopacifier, offered in two styles; Orthodontic and Rounded. Due to the soft quality of Ecopacifier, our natural rubber pacifier will not leave marks on your child's face. Child happy. Parents happy. Ecopiggy's Natural Pacifier, Ecopacifier, is made of 100% pure rubber from the rubber tree, Hevea brasillensi. These trees are sustainably grown in plantations in Malaysia. The rubber tree exudes a latex sap, the world\u2019s primary source of natural rubber, which is tapped in a similar manner to maple syrup from a maple tree. After about 20-25 years the tree stops producing latex sap. The trees are then harvested and replanted. The harvested wood is used extensively in furniture, flooring, construction and even toys. From seed to tree to ecopacifier to wooden toys, the Rubbertree has an eco-friendly, sustainable and high quality life. Ecopacifier is sustainably made in Malaysia. Ecopiggy is committed to offering the highest quality, natural products. We feel it's equally important to think of the overall footprint when manufacturing products, so we manufacturing our natural rubber pacifiers right at the source of natural rubber! They ship consolidated, and are once again hand-inspected and packaged in the USA. Happy Earth. Happy Families.",

All in all, we have 2 ecopiggy nunus and they have held up all this time. I find we tend to keep track of them better too since they are on the pricier side.We also purchased the natersutten paci at one point when we thought we lost one and it wasnt nearly as good. The quality of ecopiggy exceeds the other brands for sure. It's the only thing we'll use now.",

The only thing that sucks about this product is that it\u2019s natural rubber deteriorates over time. It\u2019s only suggested 4-6 weeks use which is a bummer to have to buy a $12-$14 pacifier every month. I wish I had known that from the beginning and I wouldn\u2019t have introduced her to them. But now she\u2019s hooked so I guess it\u2019ll be a monthly purchase. Great for baby but not great for my wallet.The smell has a little intense rubber smell and I would assume that would bother her but it doesn\u2019t. It bothers me but again, it\u2019s for baby and not for me.All in all, I\u2019m glad I found something she loves and uses constantly. She\u2019s just bougie, is all, with her fancy, expensive pacifiers.",

                "reviewText": "My son loved this pacifier, until the tip broke off out of nowhere, thankfully not while it was in his mouth. We had 2 of these, and even the second one that had not broken had lines where you could tell it was worn and could break at any time. I contacted the company, but received no response. After reading the box, it states to change the pacifier every 6-8 weeks (which of course we hadn't, it had been 5 months with 2 pacifiers) so apparently natural rubber isn't the strongest material.",
