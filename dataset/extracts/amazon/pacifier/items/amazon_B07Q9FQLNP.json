Throw away at the first signs of damage or weakness. Only use dedicated pacifier/soother holders tested to EN 12586. Never attach other ribbons or cords to a pacifier/soother, your child may be strangled by them. To prevent a possible choking hazard, test the pacifier/soother strength by pulling on the bulb portion of the nipple/teat. Inspect carefully before and after each use, especially when the child develops teeth, and discard immediately if the nipple/teat shows any signs of wear or damage, such as cracking or tearing. Small pieces can accidentally be inhaled and cause serious injury. In the event that the pacifier/soother becomes lodged in the mouth, DO NOT PANIC; it cannot be swallowed and is designed to cope with such an event. Remove from mouth with care, as gently as possible. Do not leave a child unattended with a pacifier/soother. Do not leave a pacifier/soother in direct sunlight or near a source of heat, or leave in sterilizing solution for longer than recommended, as this may weaken the nipple/teat. Never dip nipple/teat in sweet substances or medication, your child may get tooth decay. Replace the pacifier/soother between one and two months of use, for safety and hygiene reasons. Keep removable protection for the nipple/teat away from children to avoid suffocation."

Reversible (child can place the pacifier in their own mouth and there's not a right side up or upside down situation).2. Design is cute.3. Glow in the dark feature makes it easier for child to find and re-insert at night (though see cons, there is a downside.)Cons:1. When washing, water gets in the bulb and you have to turn it and squeeze the bulb to get it out. Once you get used to it, it's not too annoying.2. Only ONE of the pacifiers is glow in the dark. As the product is labeled \"glow in the dark\" to me, I thought all of them would be. Some people might like the combo, but I would prefer all of them to glow.3. Glow only lasts half the night. This isn't a big deal for my son, but you should be aware.Overall though, I love these pacifiers. My son rejected three or four kinds before we settled on these ones. Be sure to buy the right size though!",
