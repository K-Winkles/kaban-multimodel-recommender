                "reviewText": "No really. If there is one thing that was worth every penny and probably a lot more, it's the WubbaNub. At first it seems crazy to pay $12-15 for a single pacifier but we have 4 of these and nothing has gotten more use for the dollar. The carrier, the swing, the jumper, soothing seahorse, white noise machine, the bouncer - none of these have given our daughter (and us) as much comfort and they all cost a lot more. It seems like such a simple concept but it really is revolutionary.Our daughter was not a thumbsucker or a pacifier fan for the first 4 months of her life until out of desperation for better sleep and for her to self-soothe I tried this (giraffe was our first) based on the good reviews. We regret we didn't get it sooner! It seems like such a simple concept but it really is revolutionary. It's a soother and a lovie wrapped into one easy to transport package. When she was a lot younger, it stayed in her mouth so much better than a normal paci. And no more running into the nursery at all hours to help retrieve a lost paci. She can find it and replace it herself. Her Wub has gotten her through scary shots, repeated ear infections, ear tube surgery, nebulizer treatments, doctor visits, and the transition to daycare. It was the only thing that gave her any comfort during one particularly horrible diaper rash. She is 13 months old now and loves her Wubs as much as ever but now they are for naps and bedtime only. She naps 2-4 hours a day and sleeps 12 hours a night with no intervention from us. She is still nursing so it never interfered with that.Washing the WubbaNub is really easy. We throw it in a lingerie bag and wash with the rest of her clothes. It air dries very quickly. In between washes, of course you can just wash the paci portion with soap and water. I would not let concerns about cleaning deter anyone. This has become our go-to shower gift. Not every baby is a paci baby, and ours wasn't until she had her Wub. I'd give this 10 stars if I could.",

                "reviewText": "LOVE this Wubbanub! Got one as a baby gift and frankly thought it was kind of dumb. I mean, if you want a pacifier and a little stuffed animal, why do they need to be stuck together?!? And then when our son still wasn't really hooked on any particular pacifier after the first couple weeks, and after one long evening of paci-spitting and fussing, I figured we might as well try the Wubbanub. Our son loved it pretty much instantly! And the genius design of that stuffed animal meant the paci couldn't drop out of his mouth and get stuck under his neck/head. It rested perfectly on his chest while he was tiny and stayed close and easy to grab when he was a little bigger. And while I fully expected him to abandon it by the time he was crawling, he loves that thing still! It's lightweight enough that he never minded it dangling from his mouth as he became mobile. He's over 20 months now (entering the territory of restricting it to the crib, car, and emotional moments), but it's easy for us to grab and hang onto with a toddler on the go. With him on my hip and the paci in his mouth, the giraffe is long enough that I can hook a leg or tail between my fingers in case he jettisons the thing. I'm actually ordering a new one because he finally chewed a hole in his and I don't have the heart to take it away. Can't believe I'm buying a Wubbanub for my toddler, but a lovey is a lovey for a reason, and he sure does love this giraffe.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this when my son was a couple weeks old because he favored soothie pacifiers and I loved the idea of being able to more easily find the pacifier, having something my son could hold onto, and having something that sort of propped up the pacifier while he was too young to keep it in his mouth well enough on his own.This has met all those expectations wonderfully! I've since purchased two more for when my son drops his in gross places and they need to go through the washing machine. In between washes in the washing machine I wash only the pacifier part and it's not too difficult. Once in a while the tip of the giraffe's nose gets wet but that's not a big deal and it dries quickly.I should mention that I've seen other WubbaNubs and knockoff WubbaNubs and so far the giraffe is my son's very favorite. It's longer than the others and narrower and more easily stays on his chest. Now that he's 7 months old that's not important because he can keep the pacifier in his mouth and he can also put it back in his mouth if it falls out. But when he was smaller it was just the perfect size to sit and stay on his chest. He also loved holding the giraffes ears. When he first learned to grab at things he'd grab the giraffes ears happily and by default would hold the pacifier in his mouth better as he was falling asleep.I only add these things because choosing which adorable stuffed animal part was difficult but I had to keep getting the giraffe because of those reasons!One more reason to get this is that once babies can reach for things and put things in their mouth these are even more amazing. My son drops his and can easily find it and put it back in his mouth. He also loves to play with it as a toy! I can imagine him loving this for a long time, long after outgrowing pacifiers.Best purchase. I don't know how I would have made it through the infant months without these!!!",

                "reviewText": "We love wunbbanubs dor our kids. They are easy to position on a baby and don't fall out as easy if the baby spits it our. Our youngest has loved them and they helped her learn to put her passy in by herself at an early age. This being said, the giraffe is a little longer than the others she has, but not sure what I was expecting, it's a giraffe, they have long necks. Anyways I strongly recommend these products.",
