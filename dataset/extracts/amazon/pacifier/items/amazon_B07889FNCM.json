I cut the pacifier part off and kept the chicken as a lovey.- My baby was exclusively breast fed and this pacifier did not affect her latch or anything in case you\u2019re worried about that. It\u2019s a good fit for breast fed babies as well as formula fed babies.- When it gets dirty, I put it in a laundry bag and throw it in the washer. It\u2019s held up to many washings and spins in the dryer. I just wash the pacifier part with soap and hot water before giving it back to the baby.- For safety reasons, I wouldn\u2019t allow baby to sleep with it. At nap/bed time, I switch it out with a regular Avent pacifier without any issues.I absolutely love Wubbanub pacifiers and highly recommend them.",
