The extra wide air holes allow plenty of circulation around your baby's mouth and even allow you to peek at their little smile. One pacifier in this pack has a special glow in the dark feature that helps keep your baby's silicone pacifier in sight without having to turn on the light and disturb their sleep. All MAM pacifiers feature our trademarked SkinSoft silicone nipples that feel like mom and help babies transition from being breastfed to using a pacifier. In fact, market research showed that MAM nipples are easily accepted by babies of all ages, with 94% nipple acceptance among babies tested*. The textured nipple stays easily in baby's mouth and is just the right size for your 16+ months old baby so their growing teeth, palate, and jaw will be safe. Additionally, the symmetrical orthodontic nipple shape means you won't have to worry about uneven pressure or fussing to turn the pacifier \"right side up\". **Market research 2010-2020, tested with 1,572 babies",

So worth the money spent! Target has the same ones but only 2 for the same price. Also, they seem to last longer than the others I have bought before. My son chews on them constantly and this pack will last him a good few months!!",

She\u2019s two now and has teeth, but they haven\u2019t affected her teeth. We went to the dentist last week and the dentist said her teeth are perfect! Also, the glow in the dark is such a game changer! All it needs is a little light and they glow all night! It\u2019s so easy to find when she\u2019s looking for them. And it\u2019s not a hurt your eyes kind of glow, it\u2019s just right. I\u2019m nervous about weaning her off of them, but I know it has to happen eventually. Pray for me",
