        "description": "Finally, a pacifier that soothes babies and parents too! The PhysioForma Light Day & Night Pacifier is a lightweight, orthodontic pacifier with an extra ventilated shield. Double ventilation channels promote air circulation and help reduce moisture buildup on baby\u2019s soft, sensitive skin. The extra-light, airy shield is designed for comfort and breathability for a barely-there feel on baby\u2019s face. For uninterrupted soothing, the nipple is made from extra-soft silicone with a satin-textured finish for more grip and less slip. Accepted by 9 out of 10 babies. The PhysioForma Light Day & Night Orthodontic Pacifier isn\u2019t just for pacifying, it also has physiological breathing and orthodontic benefits. Clinical studies show that PhysioForma pacifiers actively support baby\u2019s breathing by positioning the tongue forward to maintain an open airway, which is especially important during sleep. Physiological breathing improves quality of sleep and reduces irritability - better for baby & you. The unique angle and lateral curve of the nipple evenly distribute tongue pressure across baby's palate. Tiny ridges and an inclined nipple shape guide proper tongue placement. Together, these important features support baby's growing palate and teeth. Our exclusive nipple design was developed, tested, and approved in partnership with an advisory panel of leading neonatologists, pediatricians, and orthodontists. Each set of Light pacifiers includes one paci for day and one glow-in-the dark paci for night. Available in three sizes: 0-6m, 6-16m, and 16-24m. Reusable, sterilizing/carry case included.",

These solve that issue, they are very light and I really like the nipple shape on these. My kids hated the straight nipples and always preferred a shape like these.I didn't realize the one was glow in the dark either, which is just awesome when it's midnight and you're trying to find the pacifier that fell out!Also love that these don't have a ring on the back which means little fingers are way less likely to get caught on the pacifier and pulled out, which happens way too often.So glad I tried these out - Will definitely get more.",

Needless to say, they both had them in when we turned off the lights, and within 5 minutes, they both had dropped them from their mouths because they quickly fell asleep!Great products.",

We've been using advent but was looking for an alternative that might be better ortho wise. Also ordered MAM. haven't tried with her yet but they are a lot bigger and thicker which if your little one is teething I'd probably be more comfortable with going with MAM brand. That's what we used for our first and never needed to switch to anything else.",

                "reviewText": "My baby likes the clear 100% silicone Chicco pacifier, so I got these when she discovered she could pull it out and toss it across the crib (or room) in her sleep. The glow-in-the-dark one is much easier to find in the middle of the night, and I like that it doesn't have a ring for baby to grasp. I might keep the non-glow-in-the-dark pacifier in the diaper bag for those long, sleepy car rides.",
