And it was lodged in there pretty good I had a hard time getting it out. So I threw every one of them in the garbage and I found these which are definitely much safer because it's all soft, there's nothing in these that can hurt the little ones. And she absolutely loves these! She'll have one in her mouth one in her hand and she'll inner switch them and she loves them and I am so glad I switched to these! I had to buy two packs because we just have them randomly all over the place. I would give a higher star if I could.",
