                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Got this in and opened it up right away and washed it so I could let my teething 6.5 month old get some relief. She LOVED it. It was easy for her to hold onto. The silicone is a perfect texture and it was super easy to clean. I put 4 or so blueberries in it and squished it ever so slightly to get some of the juices out so she could taste it better initially and she instantly was all about it. Entertained her for a good 15 min or so. Will be a great way to get them teething relief while also letting them enjoy trying new foods!",

Very easy to clean with a rinse or in the dishwasher. My son can easily hold it and get whatever is inside it into his mouth. He especially loves it when he has a new tooth coming in. I only use it in the kitchen when he is in his high chair to avoid a choking hazard or a mess. Once it starts to melt it does get a bit messy. Will reuse with my next child.",

It squeezes out the holes just enough to want to keep trying more, but not an overwhelming amount at a time. Easy to hold & easy to get food out. Also very easy to store, load, & prep for later & to clean. I love the rubber for the little baby gums to soothe too. Not hard or aggressive. The shape holds up well- unlike other types of feeders I\u2019ve tried that are mesh and get soft and just flop all over and are hard for the babies to actually eat. Minimal mess with this one as well. Love that it has a lid to close up and store for later. No complaints with this product! Easy to help them feed & they can hold on their own too.",

                "reviewText": "There is a video going around on TikTok of a woman who throws these in the garbage because they're messy and doesn't understand why you don't just use a spoon to feed your kid purees.These are not to be used with puree (although you still can) you put chunks of food in them so that your baby can safely taste new foods without you having to puree them. They are fantastic! I like to put things I normally wouldn't puree in them, such as cucumbers or bell peppers.Another thing I do is freeze purees in small ice cube trays, and then put those small frozen cubes in here. They're not as messy that way and they are great for a teething baby.Also, I really prefer these silicone ones over the mesh ones. The mesh gets kinda rough and stained over time. They are also very difficult to clean, these I just put in the dishwasher.I highly recommend. I used them for two of three kids (first kid we used the mesh ones) and I've boughten some as baby gifts as well.",
