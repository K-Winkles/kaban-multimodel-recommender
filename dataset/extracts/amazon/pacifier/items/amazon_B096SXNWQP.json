He somehow shows up with them in his mouth when he\u2019s in his playpen or his bedroom. The glow in the dark feature is AMAZING. He finds these no problems at night when he wakes him and puts himself right back to sleep, with non glowing pacifiers that doesn\u2019t usually happen. Also it makes them easier to find when he throws them out of his crib. I can\u2019t recommend these enough for picky babies!",
