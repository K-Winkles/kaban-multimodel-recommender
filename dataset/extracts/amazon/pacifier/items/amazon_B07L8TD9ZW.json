NUK's asymmetrical nipple naturally fits baby's palate and is now improved to allow for more room for a natural sucking motion, reduce pressure on teeth and jaw, and helps prevent teeth misalignment. Invented over 60 years ago by pediatric dentists and doctors, the NUK pacifier is modeled after the natural shape of mom's nipple while breastfeeding. This makes for an easy transition from breast to pacifier and back. The NUK heart-shaped shield fits perfectly under baby's nose for easier breathing and prevents irritation. With a convenient glow-in-the-dark feature to help you find lost pacifiers during the night, this pack of 2 orthodontic pacifiers is ideal for your child aged 0-6 months.
