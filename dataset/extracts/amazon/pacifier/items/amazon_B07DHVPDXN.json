The shape, fit, and response of a pacifier in your baby\u2019s mouth will influence how their palate develops and, ultimately, how their teeth will come in. Other pacifiers may collapse flat during soothing which can cause the palate to cave-in over time, also known as cross-bite.

                "reviewText": "I love these pacifiers. We had one pack purchased for us at our baby shower and I took them to the hospital with us- I\u2019m so glad I did because our baby wouldn\u2019t take the pacifier provided by the hospital but she loves these! I love how they are one piece, and don\u2019t cover her nose! They are wonderful! We purchased another pack when we got home from the hospital as back ups. I wish they had more colors- blue is ok but I would like something more neutral. I did see they have pink on their webs site but I wish amazon sold those.",

Baby seems to love them and I like they are supposed to allow for normal palate development as opposed to some of the other popular pacifier shapes out there.*Update: Baby has been using these for 8 months now and they are still like brand new. Highly recommend!",
