            "Toddler Pacifier - Natursutten's Large Size natural rubber pacifiers are the perfect size for older babies and toddlers 12 months of age and up. We also offer Small Size pacis for 0-6 months and Medium Size pacifiers for 6-12 months. Need Pacifier Storage? Add our PaciPouch Pacifier Holder, 100% Organic Cotton and machine washable",
            "Safer and Softer - Our pacifiers are made exclusively from pure natural rubber from Hevea Brasiliensis trees. They are free of BPA, phthalates, and chemical softening agents. Each natural rubber pacifier is naturally softer than silicone pacifiers and gentle on sensitive gums",
            "Best Pacifier for Breastfed Babies - Ultimately, the best pacifier is the one your baby will take. We've found that better breastfeeding pacifiers feature a Round shield that gently rests upon baby's nose, which simulates breastfeeding. Similarly, a Round bulb nipple more closely mimics the natural breast, which reduces nipple confusion in breastfed babies",
            "Supporting Healthy Teeth and Breathing - Your baby may instead prefer a butterfly pacifier shield that leaves a cut-out to let their nose be free to wriggle around and breathe! They might also prefer an Orthodontic pacifier nipple, which is flat on the bottom and reduces stress on baby's bottom teeth and jaw",
            "One Piece Baby Pacifiers - Whichever binkie is right for your baby, all Natursutten pacifiers feature one-piece construction with no joints or cracks where dirt and other yucks can collect. They're also super easy to clean with mild soap and running water. Pediatricians recommend replacing a well-used or worn pacifier every 4-6 weeks."

I was looking for a pacifier after my baby choose one that she liked and I purchased several more , I spent around one hundred bucks same brand, same size but none of them had the large nipple that my baby got used to. So I kept googling and reading reviews until i found other customers talking about the same issue and they were sharing this brand. And I\u2019m so happy for them sharing their experience. This pacifier became our favorite and this is the only one I will go with from now. It\u2019s well made, good quality, safe, easy to clean and keep it clean. I love the color it reminds me of honey and it also has a scent of honey. It\u2019s perfect for our needs! I really suggest trying it if you want to be safe and simplify your life.",

                "reviewText": "These are such perfect pacifiers! My son loves them and I am happy with the quality/natural ingredients as well. We only use two pacifier brands, this and Chicco. I am a little nervous about any that are not a complete, 1 piece due to some recalls of the two parts coming undone and the child swallowing. I know its rare but just puts my mind at east having 1 solid piece.My favorite thing about them is that there is a gap between the bulb portion and the back of the pacifier (shown in pic) This seems like it is more comfortable to me, it leaves a space for his teeth and lips. Other pacifiers seem to have a smaller space and doesn't leave room for the lips to rest. If that makes any sense the way I explained it. The rubber is very soft and pliable which also seems more comfy. The only complaints that I would have, which are so incredibly minor, is that they don't come with a case or cover. I really think thats important since they get shoved into diaper bags or around the house. I mean ya you can just rinse them or use pacifier wipes (or the default mommy's mouth) when you are out and about, I still prefer a case and its always nice when you don't have to buy one. Sooo we do have allot of the Chicco pacifier that we love also. They come with a huge case that I am the most gigantic fan of. Since they are so soft and pliable I can squeeze 3 of these babies into one of the Chicco cases! Due to the rubber they bounce and therefore easily misplaced. For this reason and due to them being a little more spendy than other brands, we only use them at home since I will eventually find them lol. Outside, they drop or he throws it, bounce bounce far away and who knows where they end up! We use the Chicco for when we are out and about. I really can't complain about the price because I think they are worth it. I also accidentally ordered the bulb shape, the chiccos are the angled shape. So I was worried that he wouldn't take to them but he actually loves it! Then, due to the bouncing and having lost a couple, I started using the Chicco while being out and thought he wouldn't like the two different shapes. It hasn't effected him at all he really likes both. Oh and he loves to chew on these also, not sure if he likes the texture or the squeaky sound of the rubber lol. I think I covered all the details so hope this review helps! Overall I definitely love them and would suggest! Oh one more thing! I recall reading a couple negative reviews about two things: The discoloration when you sanitize. yes, it turns a cloudy color but goes back to normal once it cools and dries. The other thing was the little indentation for their nose. Someone had said its really not that big of an indentation and not much of a difference if you order these or the round shape. I think I would agree with that. Im not sure if there is a price difference but if so and the round shape without the indentation is cheaper then I would just go with that. Since the bulb shape is consistent all around, my son constantly turns it upside down so that the nose indentation is on the bottom and it doesn't make any difference, it still doesn't hit his nose.",

                "reviewText": "I can't say enough amazing things about these binks. Curious what someone could possibly say negative about these (short of your baby simply not liking it), I read through the negatives. Let's start by saying the pacifier is natural rubber. My son is over two now, still fully bink-dependent, and I've gone through probably 40. I have never once noticed a smell. They clearly state that you must boil the pacifier prior to use, and that by doing so, the material will turn whitish. It also tells you if you wait, it will turn back to its original state. They also tell you the pacifier will become sticky and breakdown, and that they recommend replacing it every 4-6 weeks. If you're baby/toddler is teething or is a binky chewer, this can easily accelerate the breakdown. I've never once seen any of our pacifiers \"crack\". I'm assuming these reviews are referring to some sort of material breakdown at the base, where saliva accumulates the most, especially the ones that reference it happening \"after only a month\", as that's into the replacement time frame. Natural rubber pacifiers are not synthetic cancer pops. They breakdown. They become tacky. They turn whitish at the base eventually. They require replacement. But you know what they don't do? They don't fill your baby with toxins. Them's the breaks, kids. These aren't reasons to return your pacifier. As Tommy Boy says, \"it's on the box\". Read that box first before you toss it in and trash, and of course - weigh your options. There are a lot of amazing natural pacifiers, I'm just baby-lead to Natursutten by his preference, and a thankful parent who has mini melt-downs every time they are backordered! So in summary: these aren't flaws, it's just the name of the natural binky game!",
