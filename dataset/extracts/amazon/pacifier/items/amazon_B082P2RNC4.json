Throw away at the first signs of damage or weakness. Only use dedicated pacifier/soother holders tested to EN 12586. Never attach other ribbons or cords to a pacifier/soother, your child may be strangled by them. To prevent a possible choking hazard, test the pacifier/soother strength by pulling on the bulb portion of the nipple/teat. Inspect carefully before and after each use, especially when the child develops teeth, and discard immediately if the nipple/teat shows any signs of wear or damage, such as cracking or tearing. Small pieces can accidentally be inhaled and cause serious injury. In the event that the pacifier/soother becomes lodged in the mouth, DO NOT PANIC; it cannot be swallowed and is designed to cope with such an event. Remove from mouth with care, as gently as possible. Do not leave a child unattended with a pacifier/soother. Do not leave a pacifier/soother in direct sunlight or near a source of heat, or leave in sterilizing solution for longer than recommended, as this may weaken the nipple/teat. Never dip nipple/teat in sweet substances or medication, your child may get tooth decay. Replace the pacifier/soother between one and two months of use, for safety and hygiene reasons. Keep removable protection for the nipple/teat away from children to avoid suffocation."

Honestly hate most of their products especially the bottles. I can honestly say that this paci seems to be doing well for him as it is one of the only ones he will keep in his mouth. Unfortunately when you clean them they do retain water in the nipple. Long story short they are worth the investment, just be prepared to replace them frequently so you don't get your little one sucking on stagnant water.",

I saw these pacifiers on sale via Amazon and was enticed by the price. Unfortunately the product I brought via Amazon did not have the great glow in the dark and cap features which is frustrating despite the product description saying this does glow in the dark. The actual product is fine and washes/sterilises well. Proceed with caution if you are going to buy as different from other Dr Brown Advantage Baby Pacifiers.",
