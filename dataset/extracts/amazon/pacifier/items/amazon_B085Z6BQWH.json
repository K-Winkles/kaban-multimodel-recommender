Literally all lint and hair sticks to it and that's one of my biggest gross outs so I struggle with these. Like, I only like to travel with them in a plastic baggy so no lint or dirt gets on them in the diaper bag. They rinse really easily which is a bonus, and they don't have little crevices or holes for things to get stuck in so that's nice. My partner really likes these because they clean easy and are grippy so don't fall as frequently when she spits them out (they cling to your clothes more than another pacifier would so you can catch it), in case that's important to you!",

                "reviewText": "As a dental hygienist, one of my top concerns for my children is their oral health! These pacifiers are specifically designed to help our babies oral structure form properly, and they come in the cutest colors. The entire pacifier is also all one piece so there are no areas where water/bacteria can get trapped! Both of my children have been combo breast and bottle and have both used these pacifiers so I\u2019m sure they can be used regardless of the way a baby is fed. The shape of the top of the pacifier allows baby to be comfortable because it doesn\u2019t touch their nose!",

                "reviewText": "Any kind of nuk pacifier has a good shaped mouth piece for baby and these do as well. My only complaint is that the entire pacifier is made out of a very sticky rubber material, so every time the baby drops his binkie it immediately gets hairs and whatever else is on the ground stuck to it, so I\u2019m finding myself cleaning them way more than the average binkie. I like the color options and style but would suggest going with a different nuk pacifier.",
