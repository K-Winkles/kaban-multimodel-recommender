As a professional pet blanket manufacturer, our common goal is to design products that are more suitable for pets while also being convenient for owners. What was the inspiration for this blanket? I love my dog very much, but its excrement and hair every day really make me feel headache, so I have to do something. Why choose a waterproof blanket? Compared to regular blankets, it can prevent liquid leakage and gently press with a tissue to remove any liquid left on it. Why choose gogobunny's blanket? We have very high requirements for waterproof blankets, and continue to improve the thickness and softness. You can buy similar products to compare, we are very confident in our products. What can we promise you? We have a very comprehensive after-sales service, so you don't have to worry about any problems with the blanket during use. We will help you solve any problems that arise.",

                "reviewText": "I've recently incorporated the Gogobunny Double-Sided Waterproof Dog Bed Cover into my motorhome setup and home, and I couldn't be more satisfied. As someone who frequently camps with my dog, this cover has been a breakthrough in safeguarding my living spaces from pet messes, particularly within my motorhome.My initial purchase was to protect the benches in my motorhome from my dog's fur and dirt. The waterproof quality of the cover has been exceptional, keeping the benches spotless and moisture-free. Additionally, its durability is noteworthy, standing up admirably to the demands of outdoor life.What distinguishes this cover is its maintenance ease. Dealing with pet fur can often be challenging, but with this cover, fur removal is a breeze. This feature has been a significant time-saver for me, especially valuable after long outdoor excursions with my dog.Encouraged by its performance on benches, I got a larger version for my motorhome bed, and it's been equally fantastic. It fits perfectly, extending the same high level of protection as the smaller version. The way it repels and simplifies the removal of my Golden Retriever's fur has made it essential in my home.Cleaning this cover is also incredibly easy. Whether it's a quick shake or a thorough wash, the process is uncomplicated, and the cover maintains its quality and functionality afterwards.Considering its outstanding performance, I'm looking to get another one for my house. This product is more than just a bed cover; it's an all-encompassing solution for pet owners prioritizing cleanliness and convenience, at home or while traveling.The Gogobunny Double-Sided Waterproof Dog Bed Cover is an essential item for any pet owner, especially those who are on the move. It skillfully combines protective attributes with easy maintenance, making pet ownership more delightful and significantly tidier. An easy five-star rating from me!",

Fortunately there have been no pet accidents on them yet, but I tested the waterproof by spilling a glass of water and it just beaded up. The animals sleep on them regularly, so I washed them to avoid animal smell. Easy to wash in machine and in dryer according to directions. They came out looking like new and passed my waterproof test again. Hope they last a long time.",

                "reviewText": "We have 3 dogs and the grass in our backyard could use some help right now. So between those two factors we were basically having to vacuum dirt our of our bed every night. Definitely one of the last things you want to do before finally getting into bed at the end of the day. So when I came across this I thought maybe having it over the bed throughout the day would keep some of the dirt out of the bed. According to my husband it is the best thing I've ever bought! It truly works wonders. Our dogs go in and out of the house multiple times a day and are in and out of the bed all day also. We keep this cover on from the time we get up in the morning until we go to bed and all the dirt collects on top of it. I bought under mattress straps to attach the bottom of the cover (other side clips to the fitted sheet at the top.) so at the end of the day we just flip it down off the bed, all the dirt hits the floor instead of our sheets, and it's easy to flip back up over the bed in the morning. Our robot vacuum comes to get the dirt off the floor and no one has to vacuum the bed!!! Seriously, seriously a game changer for us. The water resistance is an amazing feature too! Dirt + rain = mud. This has saved our sheets from muddy paws many a times! And because it's absorbent the mud dries to loose vacuumable dirt rather than stuck on mud that needs to be scrubbed or full out washed. The water proofing also allows us to let our dogs get on the bed when they're wet, which they love! Our boy likes to rub his body all over to try and dry off and we'd never let him do it on the bed, for obvious reasons, but now he can run and rub and be crazy to his hearts content and we still have a dry bed underneath. Our great dane gets cold coming out of the shower so she likes to lay in bed under blankets after, still a perfectly dry bed for us! The only downsides are the lack of durability and the secondary color. I bought the yellow cover and the lighter side is such an awful hospital yellow. It looks like a puppy pad. Would never have that side up. But the darker side is the color I really wanted so all is well just no changing shades for us. Now back to durability, or lack there of. We do have a tear or two in the main area of the cover. They aren't all the way through, just one layer. But like I said, we have 3 big dogs and they put this thing to the test so I'm not too upset about the little tears. I am however disappointed that the lining around the edge is ripping off already. We have it clipped under the bed and it's ripping right where the dogs jump on to the bed so I'm sure that's why but still disappointing. I would definitely buy again but would also consider trying another brand that might be a bit more durable.",

It's also warm where we can remove one of the other 2 blankets we usually use. I like that it's double sided with a different color on each side. I'm planning to buy another 1 or 2 of a different color.Because it's waterproof, it took 3 times in the dryer to get it completely dry. My dryer is only 3 years old so I don't think the age of my dryer is the reason drying took that long.",

Certainly I wouldn't put it on a bed, as advertised, since I sure wouldn't want to sleep under it.I purchased it to stop dog paws on my furniture and with the immediate viewing of this product, it is useless. I am sure it would last a week at most.I wanted to return it, but I would have to pay for the postage which added more unhappiness to the purchase so it WILL COST to view this substandard product. This is the first time in my years of dealing with Amazon that I would have to pay postage to get a return for a substandard product.
