                "reviewText": "We used these a little different than the manufacturer suggested, but they worked beautifully.We have two dogs that are always losing their balls under the sofa, so these were a perfect idea.One problem... We have carpet, so the sticky bottom would not stick to the floor. So my crafty husband suggested another way. Now, keep in mind that we did NOT follow the rules, and we understood that we could have damaged our furniture, but we have old couches that I would not have been heartbroken if they were damaged. We had no intention of returning these items after our decision was made.We flipped the sofa over, and used a drill with self tapping screws and screwed the plastic straight into the underside of the wood frame. We flipped the plastic upside-down and used the part that is supposed to stick to the floor to drill the holes- so essentially, once the sofa was right side up, the plastic hangs down and skims the top of the carpet.Worked beautifully. We had to use a box cutter to trim a few pieces shorter to make sure the plastic went all the way around the sofa, but no more lost balls!Remember, we went rogue, and the manufacturer would not have been responsible if we messed it all up, but we got lucky! Maybe this review will help someone else with carpet.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these to keep my cat's toys from getting under the couch, fridge, and stove. They worked perfectly and were very easy to install! I've had them in the same spots on my floor for over three years, but now I'm moving and had to pull them up. I was worried that there would be a lot of residue or damage to my floors (vinyl planks), but there was nothing! If I hadn't pulled them up myself I'd never have known they were ever there. I was so impressed that I came back to write this review! These are also incredibly sturdy and the adhesive is very strong. I have a sleeper sofa, so whenever I move my couch to clean the sleeper apparatus drags against these blockers - I can hear them bending and being dragged under the couch, but they've never once broken or shifted. I can't recommend these enough!",

However, I wanted to reposition one of the pieces since it was too close to the edge of the couch, but when I pulled it up the plastic literally shattered because the adhesive was that strong! Also will need to buy more as I only purchased one box and I have a sectional couch, one box-minus the one that broke when I pulled it up-is barely enough for one side of my couch. As long as you carefully place it before putting in on the floor, and purchase enough, I\u2019d say this is a great buy!",

                "reviewText": "This was a good idea, however the plastic is quite thin and flimsy. If you just need something because your dog \"accidentally\" rolls balls under the furniture at times, this will probably work fine. Unfortunately, if you have a demon dog that is a 60lb adolescent german shepherd who for reasons only known to his bizarre little doggy brain has a compulsion to shove balls as far as possible under furniture and then whine and bark incessantly until you get them out only for him to repeat this process again and again, it probably won't work.I realize that was quite a sentence. Suffice it to say if your dog, like mine, REALLY wants to shove toys under furniture, this is unlikely to hold up and the plastic will quickly bend and crack even though the adhesive seems quite solid.",

And I did a test run with the adhesive on my wood floors and when I removed one after a few days there was no residue. So far these are great!!! My only issue is that when you cut them to fit your exact size of opening they are kinda difficult to cut. I would imagine sharp scissors would doThe trick, I just didn\u2019t happen to have them at the moment.",

We have a pull out couch that has the wheels underneath so I just cut smaller pieces so it'd still be able to roll out.
