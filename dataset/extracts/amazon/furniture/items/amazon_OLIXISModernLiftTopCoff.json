                "reviewText": "I got this table on sale and I didn't have high expectations given the price. As is true of a lot of things, in general, good furniture ain't cheap, and cheap furniture ain't good. But I've been pleasantly surprised.I'll say first that I actually needed a small coffee table. I've seen reviews that seem surprised at how small it is; yes, it's pretty small. That said, I'd have been ok if it was even smaller! It's not tiny, but it is maybe 10% smaller than the coffee table I have in my main living room. (I was buying this for a family/game room.) For reference, in the picture I uploaded, that's the new Atari 2600+, not the original Atari 2600, so it's smaller than you might be thinking. So be aware of that. It's great if your couch has to be fairly close to whatever it's facing, though. That was my situation, so I actually found this in a search for \"small coffee table\".As you might expect from the price, this table is Chinese-made, flat-pack shipped and made of particle board with a laminate on top for looks. That said, it's done well. If you've ever bought IKEA furniture, it's basically an exact copy of that. It requires some assembly, but it's fairly simple. I did it in about an hour and I had to take several breaks because I had a cold while doing it! I also did it all by hand. There are a bunch of screws and bolts you need to screw in, so a power tool of some sort would help. But it's not hard even to do manually.The instructions are absolutely not hard to follow. I've seen a couple of other reviews that say otherwise. Put your thinking cap on and use your brain. It shows you exactly what to do. I had no problems at all following the instructions. I've seen pictures someone posted in another review that clearly showed an obvious mistake in following the instructions (I can see exactly where they went wrong) that they then blamed on a manufacturing error. No, look again. Measure twice, cut once, as they say. Don't rush through the build and you'll be fine.When fully assembled, the table looks good and is very functional. I'm not using a laptop like they show in the official pictures but I appreciate that there is storage in there when you lift the top. There's also storage on the sides. The table itself feels pretty solid. I'd make sure you use coasters for your drinks because this kind of laminate always warps if it gets wet for too long, but that's hardly unique to this table.My only real critique - and I've seen others mention this too - is that the two top panels, one of which lifts and the other doesn't, don't *quite* line up right on my table. I mean the gap in between them is probably 2mm on one side and 1mm on the other. This definitely *can* be adjusted by adjusting the exact positioning of the hinges on the movable top, but it's kind of a pain to do that and not really worth it unless you have extreme OCD. I'm fine with it. It's not really noticeable unless you're looking for it (I was). And again, at this price, I was never really expecting absolute perfection. But it's just worth mentioning if you're someone who has to have everything just right. Again, cheap furniture. Spend more if you want perfection.I'm totally happy with it for what I paid.",

                "reviewText": "My husband and I recently moved and really wanted a coffee table. We were looking for one that had a tray that came up and originally were looking for people selling used ones. But then I came across this one, showed it to my husband, and we both agreed we loved the style and the price was acceptable as well.I wish I could give half stars because I would give the table and assembly 4 1/2 stars. I do feel like I have to be cautious pulling up the tray and putting it back down though I haven't felt any concerns about it tipping over. Assembly can be done by one person (that one person being a 4'11,\" weighs almost nothing woman) which was great because I like putting things together by myself. The half star I would take off is putting in the little screws. There's small holes where they're supposed to be placed but it's easy to accidentally screw them in a little crooked and if you try to readjust the screw without taking it all the way out, it will easy chip the top layer of the wood. It's not that big of a deal because they're tiny chips and in places no one's going to see, but I still didn't like it.It does look small in our living room with the huge couches we have but it's actually the perfect size to fit in front of the chair that doesn't recline and the console section. The tray comes up to a good height for both my husband and me. We love the storage sections. Keep in mind that the side storage section is divided, it's not a large, open storage. You'll have a small space facing toward your couch and one facing away from the couch (which I'm still not sure what to do with because it's inconvenient to place anything there). It would have been nice if it was open all the way through or had a back wall furthest away from the couch.All in all, my husband and love this coffee table and highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "This coffee table is a Christmas gift for my grandmother initially sparked excitement, but unfortunately, it faced a stability challenge. Despite ruling out an uneven floor, I discovered a minor discrepancy in the length of the legs. While non-adjustable, this created a rocking motion. Additionally, the lifting mechanism proved cumbersome due to uneven pressure in the pistons, making it challenging for my grandmother to elevate the table effortlessly. Despite these issues, the aesthetic appeal remains, and we hope for a resolution to enhance the overall experience.",
