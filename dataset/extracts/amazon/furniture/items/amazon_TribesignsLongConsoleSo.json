                "reviewText": "I've bought Tribesigns products before. I have a computer desk that I'm typing on right now that I've had for a couple of years that I'm very happy with. So it was a no-brainer for me to buy from them again when I was looking for something similar to this. To be clear, I'm not disappointed with my purchase. I'm very happy that I bought it and I think it looks really good. The issue is that the quality seems to be less than previous Tribesigns products that I've bought. Maybe it's just my perception, but on my desk that I bought a few years ago all of the metal pieces feel nice and smooth while all of the metal bits on this have that rough feeling that I usually associate with cheap production. In fact a couple of the metal rods were bent almost flat on the end, so I had to get some pliers to rebend them to be round in order to fit in the holes.The instructions are the real issue here though. It's sad because I don't remember the instructions being this bad on my other Tribesigns products. My desk actually came with 2 sets of instructions for however you wanted to orient the desk, and they had multiple pages with text on each instruction. Not so here. You get one page and really the only explanation you'll see is the difference between the front and back of the table. Sorry, I meant the \"front\" and \"after\". It's not the most complicated thing to put together and all in all it took me about an hour by myself. I'd suggest 2 people, but it is possible to do it solo.Like I said, all in all I'm happy, but from my perspective it just seems that from the time I first bought one of their products to now the quality of the materials and the instructions has gone down. I guess I'll just have to see how they are when/if I buy from them again.",

                "reviewText": "The table looks pretty good for the price. The quality is on the cheap side as expected. The metal is flimsy and bends easily. If you just plan to put a few pieces of decor on it, it should hold up just fine. Though not luxurious, the wood is better quality than I was expecting at this price point.My main issue with it is that, if you look carefully at the photos, the wooden boards of the two lower shelves are not well supported. It rests on the front beam but is parallel to the back beam and is held in place by 4 screws in the back. I am sure that greatly decreases the weight capacity of these 2 shelves. Being as I was intending to use this as a book shelf, I'm not too happy about this design. I doubt it will hold all the heavy textbooks that I want it to hold.As mentioned by other reviewers, the instructions are rather inadequate but assembly was not too difficult. Two people is easier but doable with one person. One thing the instructions don't mention is that the side panels have a front and back. You need make sure they're in the right orientation or the shelves won't fit on it.I'm happy with the purchase overall.",
