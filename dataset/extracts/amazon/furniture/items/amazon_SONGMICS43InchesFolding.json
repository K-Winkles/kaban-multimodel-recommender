Don\u2019t take up space and might use them later.I was very happy with the sleek design it has. Good fit for my living room or bedroom. The top is very strong and looks great. Like the tufts and buttons.Looks quality. I have 2 queen size comforters and six throws in mine. There is still some room. You can definitely sit on it. It is very sturdy.

Not only is it budget-friendly, but it also offers great quality. The design is sleek and modern, fitting perfectly with my living room or bedroom decor. What impressed me the most was how easy it was to assemble. The instructions were clear and all the necessary tools were provided. Within minutes, I had a sturdy and comfortable ottoman ready to use. The cushioning is plush and supportive, making it a great addition for relaxation or as extra seating. The storage compartment is also great! Overall, I highly recommend this ottoman for anyone looking to add both style and functionality to their space without breaking the bank.",

It took a bit of maneuvering to get the lid to fit properly because it\u2019s super snug (a good thing)\u2014I had to place the back and sides of the lid onto the storage box first, then pull the front of the lid out a bit to fit onto the front of the storage trunk. It\u2019s a tight fit. The trunk/bench is sturdy when sitting on it to put on shoes, and the fabric and tufted buttons seem to be well-made enough to hold up over time. I like it! It fits well at the bottom of a queen size Ikea Malm bed and mine is holding 3 sets of queen sheets with 6 queen pillow cases, 4 king size pillow cases, 2 quilt-style queen size comforters, 4 pillow quilt-style shams, 2 queen size pillows, 2 small lap blankets, plus some misc pillow protectors! A bit more narrow looking in width for the bottom of my Queen Ikea Malm bed than I\u2019d like it to look, but for $50 it\u2019s great. Larger storage benches are $150 and up typically (Target, etc). The dimensions on Amazon, the China packaging of the product, and the actual storage bench, are interestingly all different.Amazon ad:43 inches length x 15 in height x 15 in widthActual size:43 x 14 x 15.Box states:114.5 cm length (45 inches length)39.5 cm width (15 1/2 inches width)8.5 (3.35 inches height)I don\u2019t use the divider that inserts into grooves down the middle of the trunk/Ben h to create 2 compartments \u2014I slid it down the right side of the trunk/bench in case I need 2 compartments later and it fits there fine. The darker gray is neutral enough to coordinate with lots of furniture and bedding colors. Great purchase!",
