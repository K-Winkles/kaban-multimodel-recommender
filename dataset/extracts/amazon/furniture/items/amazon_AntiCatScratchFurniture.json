I trimmed off all the hanging threads and my grandson recommended this furniture protection from cat attacks. It works like a charm and I'm happy again! I check my sofa and love seat daily but that one area seems to be the only place he has bothered. If I find damage in other areas, there is plenty of plastic film to protect those as well. The film stays securely in place and is hardly noticeable when either a coffee table or a large ottoman blocks the view. I'm happy with this worthy investment that is also easy to cut, install, and maintain.",

                "reviewText": "I thought I was getting 12 sheets of the bigger sheets but the pack is really only 6 bigger ones and a bunch of thinner strips of them. They stuck ok to the smooth plastic shelf and leather I put them on but the cloth couch and the rattan furniture didn't stick at all and needed the pins. The pins got pulled out by the kitten in a few days on the rattan furniture he liked to try to scratch and a week in the cloth couch. Bit worried about him eating them. He likes to pull it up and chew the plastic. Plastic held up great but keep an eye that they don't pull off and swallow a pin. The areas it actually stuck so far is deterring him good. The pinned on one's that are coming off easily became a toy. I didn't have enough big sheets to fully cover so he got around it by trying to scratch the inch of exposed corner the sheet didn't cover.",
