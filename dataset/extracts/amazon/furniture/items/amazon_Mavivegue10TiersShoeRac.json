This design will last and holds a lot of shoes with or without shoe boxes. It's lightweight & was not difficult to assemble.",

                "reviewText": "I needed shoe storage and I didn't want to spend a ton of money on it. I was actually pleasantly surprised at how sturdy this was after I assembled it. It's not going to hold up to someone sitting on it or kids ramming into it, but for holding shoes it's great! And I really like that it can hold a variety of footwear - tall boots and booties as well as low shoes. I don't wear high heels, but I don't think this would be a good option for heels since the \"shelves\" are a series of plastic rods, so the heel would fall through. Putting it together wasn't that difficult though it feels a little daunting when you open the package and see all the parts. It's large and does take up quite a bit of real-estate, but if you have an extensive footwear collection and want it visible, this could by your answer. I'd buy this again if I needed another wall of shoes :-)",

I just looked again to verify that the picture does say this and I wasn't confused, because I just opened my second box and sure enough, there are still no shelf liners and only 1 set of hooks. It's still a nice, sturdy shelf, but I'm sure others are too and I chose this one for the extras.It's easy to assemble but the cheesy wooden hammer broke after assembling 3 shelves so I ended up using a regular hammer and tapping lightly so I didn't bend the bars. I'd likely buy this again, but not at full price given that I have to go buy the shelf liners I thought I was getting with this shelf.",

                "reviewText": "I don't always write reviews, but I read all the reviews on this product and thought I'd return the favour, as those reviews were so helpful and what led to this purchase. For such a huge item, it arrived in a compact box, which I liked right away from an ethical packaging perspective. When you tip the box, don't be alarmed by the many pieces. I was a bit daunted for the first minute. Group all the bars into their size groups, grab a glass of wine, and assembly should take less than an hour of time and be fun to do. Pay attention to the outside brackets - the ones labelled \"A\" as they don't have the four holes on each side and they are the outside pieces. Separate them first and from there, assembly is super easy. The other thing I like about this item is the way you can customize where the 4 plastic sheeting shelves can go. I didn't want mine on the bottom for boots. I wanted mine on the top for hats, so I just assembled it a different way which is an excellent feature of this item. The depth of the shelves allows for large running shoes which I noticed other shelves did not. Depending on the width of some boots (like work boots) and the size of feet (my husband is a wide size 12) one shelf may not hold two pairs together. See the pictures. However, I doubled up thinner shoes as the shelf depth allows for that, so even with three shelves used for hats and a basket of boot crampons, I have enough space for 40 pairs. If you need this unit just for boots, it will not hold 40 pairs, but this has tidied up all our boots, flip flops, and running shoes incredibly well. I also love the hooks at the side for dog leashes! I do not need any more storage, but if I did, I would buy this again and I recommend it to anyone struggling with mudroom chaos!",
