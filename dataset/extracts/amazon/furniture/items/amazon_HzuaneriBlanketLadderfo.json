The stickers were easily removed and a quick wipe with a damp cloth removed the packaging dust. I did not attach it to my wall yet as I\u2019m unsure if I will keep it in this location after the holidays. The hooks add a more vintage feel for me. It will be great place to hang my Christmas stockings for the moment, until I fill it with blankets. Very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "As for the quality it is a thick wood like material. Not sure if it\u2019s real wood but looks nice! It\u2019s light to move around. I love the natural darker wood color. It\u2019s not off line and straight. The one thing that bugs me is the hooks on top slide around but you can screw them down if you wanted to. It\u2019s the perfect piece for a small space and if you love all the feels of comfy cozy blankets. Keeps the living space clean and picked up. (Bought for my she shed & absolutely would buy again.)",
