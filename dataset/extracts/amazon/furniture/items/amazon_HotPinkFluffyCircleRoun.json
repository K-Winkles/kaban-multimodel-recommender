                "reviewText": "I bought this rug and a couple more in smaller sizes for my kids' bedrooms. It was great at first but these rugs aren't easy to clean and they cannot be vacuumed or even shaken out to get the stuff caught in the fibers. If pencil shavings, stickers, little pieces of paper, or anything else gets stuck in the shag fibers of the rug, they will be there for life or else you'll have to spend time picking little things out one by one with tweezers. And you'll have to cut stickers out. Several washes later and all of that stuff was still stuck in there.I'm sad to say that after about a year of owning these rugs, I had to throw them away. I couldn't even give them away because there was so much little bits of papers and confetti and other stuff stuck in there. It made their bedrooms look so dirty. Also, these were washed so many times that the lining began to come away from the fibers, leaving the rug in a warped shape and it no longer laid flat on the floor.If you're getting these for your small children's bedrooms, you might want to consider a different rug, preferably one that is easy to wash and vacuum. Kids love to tear papers, crayon wrappers, and drop stickers and if they do any of that on this rug, whatever little paper thing they drop will be impossible to remove.I rated it 3 stars because it was cute and soft. But cleaning and vacuuming ability was a huge deal for me and I wish there had been reviews regarding how difficult it was to clean and vacuum. So I'm leaving one now for others to see. I'm on here today searching for a different rug for my kids' rooms. This rug would be great in a room that hardly gets used, and great for display or something. But not great for use.",
