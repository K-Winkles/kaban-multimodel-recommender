It took me three days to assemble it but I must admit I only spent an hour to hour and a half each day. It was fairly easy to assemble but there are a LOT of small parts. When assembling it be aware that there are two sizes of dowels and you need to take the draw slides apart - the instructions aren't clear on that part. Overall I'm satisfied and would recommend if you're looking for a smaller piece of furniture. I'm using mine in the bathroom for additional storage.",

But EVERYTHING was there and the instructions walked you thru EVERY step of construction. With pictures to ensure everything was oriented correctly and neatly labeled pieces, the instructions guide you thru making this cabinet. Once completed, this cabinet makes the perfect addition to our bathroom. The style (farmhouse barn door) also fit perfectly with our house. We had searched all the local places and big box stores for something like this, found nothing. This is perfect. It hold 8 rolls of TP behind the barn door and some bathroom gels or shampoo. The drawers hold washcloths for weekly usage. It was a bit daunting at first, but it came together beautifully and looks great in our bathroom.",

                "reviewText": "I've always had an awkward space in my bathroom so while redecorating, I decided to fill it. This was perfect for the job. The dimensions are very accurate, all the parts and pieces were extremely well labeled, no damage to anything, and the finished product is stable and gorgeous. The only thing that could be a con is that the instructions have no words at all, just pictures. That being said, the pictures are extremely detailed and the parts are so well labeled that it was not an issue. A couple recommendations for anyone building it: 1, I know a lot of people skip anchoring to the wall, with this unit, I would 100% recommend not to skip that step. It's not heavy enough on its own to keep it stable by itself, especially when you open the drawer or cabinet. 2, be careful with tightening the screws. They are extremely cheap and strip easily. This is not a bash, if everything was top quality, it would cost 3x as much. But if using a drill, go very very slow. Overall, it looks and feels fantastic once put together. Much more expensive looking than what it cost. Would definitely recommend this.",

                "reviewText": "Firstly, this cabinet was the most well packed cabinet I have seen in a long time. Everything was packed and labeled well with padding throughout. All parts were clearly labeled and there was even a spare parts bag. The instructions were VERY clear and easy to follow for the most part. We\u2019ll get back to that. Once assembled, this felt very strong. They even included glue for the dowels.The ONLY minor complaint was assembling the draws. Instructions were fairly clear but they left play in where you can put the screws for the rails. And didn\u2019t show how to get the rails apart 100%. But easy enough to figure out. It was difficult to get all the draws in straight. 2 of the 3 were perfect with the bottom one just slightly off. Nothing concerning.I would definitely buy this again!!",
