I'd been warned to put these on the furniture immediately, and it was great advice. A lot of sizes, easy to do, just stick them on the feet of the furniture, and save lots of dollars in floor repair - plus everything is easier to move.",

                "reviewText": "I recently got the \"Felt Furniture Pads Self Adhesive\" to protect my luxury vinyl plank (LVP) floors from scratches caused by furniture movement. While these pads do the job to some extent, I have mixed feelings about them.Pros:Effective Protection: These felt furniture pads do provide some protection to my LVP floors. They effectively prevent scratches and scuffs that can occur when moving furniture. Theadhesive feature makes them easy to apply to the furniture legs, ensuring they stay in place and do their job.Cons:Thickness: My main concern with these pads is their thickness. They are thin, which might compromise their long-term durability and effectiveness. I wish they were bit more thicker for better cushioning and protection.Price: At $11 for what seems like a small quantity, I found these pads to be quite expensive for what you get. I remember seeing similar products with 50 pieces at the dollar store before the pandemic, which makes this purchase feel like a big splurge.In conclusion, the \"Felt Furniture Pads Self Adhesive\" do their job in protecting LVP floors from scratches caused by furniture. However, the thinness of the pads and their relatively high price point are notable drawbacks. While they are effective, I can't help but wish for a more cost-effective and thicker alternative, especially considering what was available before the pandemic. If you're in dire need of floor protection, these pads will work, but you might want to explore more budget-friendly options if you have a large furniture collection to outfit.",

The pads have a very strong adhesive so be sure you have them in the correct position before pushing them in position.You can peel them off but you may need to discard that pad afterwards. But there are plenty on pads of various sizes to choose from and they can always be cut to size if necessary.The chairs now slide soundlessly and smoothly when moved.Very pleased with them.",
