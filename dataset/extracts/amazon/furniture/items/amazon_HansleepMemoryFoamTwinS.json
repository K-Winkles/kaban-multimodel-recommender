It\u2019s not extremely thick so can be rolled up and transported without taking up to much space. It has been a life saver. Price was also amazing and would recommend for any bed or even as an air mattress topper.",

I'm not the one sleeping on it, it's my kid, and no complaints from her, just complaints from my back when I'm sitting in their bed to sing/read before bed.",

I didn\u2019t want to buy another mattress at the moment because I\u2019m moving soon and getting a bigger bed. This was worth buying and it didn\u2019t smell. I love the coolness from the mattress.

If you\u2019re impatient (like me) and don\u2019t want to wait 48 hours for air to inflate just throw it in the dryer for 10-15 mins and follow up with a hair dryer to work out the wrinkles! Super comfy already. Also make sure the tag side / memory foam side is facing up not the other way around. There\u2019s a reason the white options looks a little blue in the pictures :)",

                "reviewText": "I didn't believe many of the reviews on here about the lumps after first wash, maybe they did something wrong? But it's true! This is a nice mattress topper IF you do not plan on ever washing it. This is mind blowing to me because it is bedding and needs to be washed! Especially with it having a chemical smell out of the packaging.My son was so happy when he got it and it looked beautiful and so cozy. I went to the tag and followed instructions, delicate and cold wash. I dried on tumble low and then hung to finish drying. I treated it very delicately because of fear of these lumps people or posting pictures of.It is finally dry and LUMPS of gel memory foam everywhere inside!. Worst part, the foam looks like it ripped inside the center leaving no foam at all in center. After searching for weeks for a perfect topper for my child I grabbed this one because it looked nice and was on a lightning deal, cant beat ti!. But now I see why the price, it is a one time use topper. I've never been so disappointed because my son was so happy for it and now is sad because he can't use it! Tag should say SPOT CLEAN ONLY, No wash! But bedding needs to be washed so this is ridiculous! I'm guessing the people leaving good reviews have not washed it yet. I have to wash everything that I buy that goes in contact with skin, I regret this purchase! Wish I added a other 35 and bought a better quality topper. \u2639\ufe0f*UPDATE*Had to add some stars for great customer service. They offered to send my son a new one. I will not be washing it this time! In future, for the price, I can repurchase a new one instead.",

                "reviewText": "As someone who has bought various toppers before, ranging from egg crate foam toppers, flat memory foam toppers, and down alternative pocketed toppers (that are more like an extra sheet on a mattress).... I honestly didn't expect much after I got this topper out of the packaging. It wasn't very thick, so I imagined I would sink and it's contents would push around my body rendering it useless. But that is not the case. The inch and a half plushness may as well be 3 inches. Lying on my bed with this topper, it feels so plush... It has brought my mattress back to life and my bed is more comfortable than it ever was. I did buy this on sale... if you find it on sale, you should go ahead and get it. It is worth every penny and more! I will come back and buy this anytime I need a topper in the future, for sure!\ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1fEdited to add: I notice a lot of reviewers that weren't happy with the topper have it inside out. Make sure the tag is on the outside. The gel memory foam should be on top and the down filling should be on the bottom. I think the down filling at the bottom and the gel foam on top is why it's so plush, the down filling holds the gel foam up. This is why it doesn't spread and stays plush under your body. Inside out/upside down, I don't think the topper would have the same effects.2nd Edit - It's been nearly 4 months since my initial review. Since then I have enjoyed sleeping with this topper on my mattress. I also had one delivered to my stepdad for his birthday. He now loves this mattress topper as much as I do and says it saved him from having to buy a new mattress right now. If you do get this topper, it's important to let it expand and to put it on correctly. If you do both, you won't be disappointed. This however, is not an actual mattress, but if you just need a more comfortable mattress and better nights sleep... You won't be disappointed.I am going to order another topper after my deluxe air mattress is delivered. Hoping it will allow an air mattress when camping to feel more like my mattress at home. I will update my review then also.",
