They fit perfectly under my bathroom vanity sink area and make it a lot neater and easier to organize and reach with the pull out drawer on the bottom. The dividers on the top part are good because you have the option to use them in many different configurations, and create the perfect size shape for many smaller things or one big one and all in between. Lol. I like them. Good purchase and happily organizing!! cough cough",

Like other reviewers mentioned, they don't fit traditional cleaning products on the bottom drawer, but I was able to find so many other uses. I have one on my counter organizing vitamins, medical needs (OTC meds, thermometer, etc) and various things along those lines. I have one in my bathroom organizing lotions, body sprays, hair products, etc. They work great for all sorts of things. They're super quick and easy to assemble and very sturdy. Definitely glad I bought them!",

Also, I might try to put the front feet up on those furniture pads so the drawer will clear the lip in the front of the cabinet better. Again, not the fault of this product.I also used one in my slim hall closet and it's great.",
