It's also surprisingly sturdy, especially for something is held together without glue or hardware.The assembly instructions are not written the best, but it was easy to figure out. You'll need to be firm and even when pressing the pieces together. Knocking down one star because the dimensions in the description are not accurate (although it actually did turn out to be roomy enough to accommodate a pair of running shoes) and because it wants to lean a little (not enough to make me worry, but I might anchor it to the wall).",

                "reviewText": "It was easy enough to assemble though the parts I already assembled kept coming apart as I assembled the additional shelves. I thought the weight of shoes on the shelves would make it sturdier but it did not. Pieces came apart within a few days as I placed or removed shoes from the shelves.After 2 weeks, I took it apart and reassembled it with wood glue. It is now almost perfect. I say almost because I would be happier if it was just a tad bit wider. I have big feet - I wear a size 10 in Women's shoes and I have to place my shoes on the shelves one at a time otherwise if I hold the shoes in one hand and try to place them on the shelf together, they don't fit.Also, I cannot fit low-rise boots on the shelves so I can only store one pair at a time on the top shelf.It is VERY lightweight and not very sturdy so it should be placed somewhere it cannot easily be bumped into. I have it near my front door but it is positioned in way that it cannot be knocked over.",

I had to use the mallet because the pressure is what hold it all together so no screws or nails are required. When I was on the last panel I realized it came cracked so I asked for a replacement but the replacement is of lower quality and falls apart if I tried to move it. The panels and the rods are different sizes. The first one is thick and sturdy and the replacement is thinner and flimsy. Since I couldn\u2019t just replace the one damaged panel I had to build the replacement tower and nothing is held in place. If I try to move the replacement tower it falls apart in pieces. This was not an issue with the first one at all. Now I\u2019m afraid if I order a third replacement what I will get\u2026 the original one that is sturdy and worth what I paid or this flimsy thing that falls apart.",

Women's size 9 shoes fit fine and you just have to put the men's size 10's in one at a time - both hang out a bit over the front. Anything much bigger might be a problem. Wish I could buy a smaller set to add a few more rows. They fit together really well and were pretty sturdy once in place. Technically you only get two top sections (it has a different style post so there's no hole). I needed 3 stacks so one has a gap in the top but it still functions well and you can't see it anyway.",
