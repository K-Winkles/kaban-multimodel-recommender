I was concerned that the toilet paper holder bar felt light and was worried it might not hold up, but it spins freely without any issues so far. The cabinet underneath is wide enough to hold the Charmin mega rolls of toilet paper. The small shelf on top is the perfect size to hold a pack of wet wipes and a spray bottle of poo-pourri.",

I found several thing's I would do differently when putting it together. The broken piece happened when I was trying to push the panel in the interlocking spot with my palm. When attaching the toilet paper to the holder and trying to place it, its really hard since there is not much room. I use Charmin so I guess it would be easier with say, Scott's. The material is Gypsum with a thin laminate almost like paper on top. You will need to attach the knob before you attach the front panel. It will save you frustration.",
