Perfect coffee table and cat stays away from guests! You know the ones who say, \u201cI really don\u2019t care for cats.\u201d But i do love it and it\u2019s a conversation piece. Works great and looks great! Seriously!",

                "reviewText": "This is smaller than I thought as I didn't measure it or look as the pic looked like it was bigger. But! It works for us as we got it for our smaller cat in mind and wanted to use the litter box without the lid.We did take the advice of another reviewer and lined it inside with a shelf liner so we can clean it in case she has any accidents or misses the box etc.It was easy to put together although we should have looked ahead a bit more as we had the bottom upside down we noticed when we went to put the doors on. So we had to take the back panel off and then unscrew a couple screws to slide the bottom out and flip it. But we got it all put back the right way after that. So be mindful when you are putting it together about the small holes on the bottom panel that are for the doors to be on top.Anyway, this is working well and she took right to it no worries. I love the doors in the front making it super easy to clean. Just need a light in there I think. But it is sturdy and could put her little cushion cat bed on it and she has slept right on that too! :)",
