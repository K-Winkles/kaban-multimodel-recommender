                "reviewText": "For what you pay for these night stands, they're great. I got two of these for a little less than the price of one of the night stands they were replacing. Let's go through the pros and cons.Pros:They look nice! They're true to color from the pictures. I got dark wood and grey drawers and I have no complains about how they look.They're very affordable. The IKEA one's I had before were going for 80$ a pop now. These are a great value for the price.Light-weight. Makes them easy to move if needed.Drawers come all the way out without any fiddling.Super easy to assemble.Shallow so good for tight spaces but big enough top for an alarm clock, chargers etcBIG drawers. You can put a ton in these bad boysCons:Light weight. These things are so light that they wobble on carpet and can be knocked around/over if you don't fill the drawers.The drawers come out without any fiddling. This can be a bonus but if you're not intending to remove the drawers, there's nothing stopping them form coming all the way out and spilling all their contents.Shallow. The dimensions can be good for tight spaces, and the width is great. I wish they were a bit longer, though. You either have to put them far away from the wall and have an awkward gap, or have them closer to the wall and then they're sitting behind the pillow.All in all, I'd say they're pretty good. A little more weight to it would be mice but not really a problem. Same with the depth. Looks good, functions great, and great quality for the price.",

I got 5 of the 8 successfully before I threw in the towel! And I have small fingers. I couldn't imagine what that would be like with bigger fingers!! \ud83e\udd2c The screws just would not go into the plastic threaded hole.

It's a bit short, but it works for what I need it for. I have some items like chapstik, books, notebooks, etc. that I like to keep nearby my bed, and this has plenty of space with two drawers for everything. I have most of my stuff in the top drawer and my cat has decided she likes the bottom drawer lol. It was super easy to assemble and took maybe 15 minutes at most to put together. I would highly recommend this if you have a small space or just want something light and quick you can put together.",
