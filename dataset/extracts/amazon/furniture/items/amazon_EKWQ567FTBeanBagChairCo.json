We saw a pinterest that sold something similar that you put all the stuffed animals into and then use as a chair/bed.It arrives ready to use. The zipper works easily.It seems to be made well. The zipper is durable and the fabric is very soft and plushy feeling.We put most of her collection in the cover. I didn't realize it would hold so much but she was able to fill it anyway.We put the firmer stuffed ones on the bottom and the squishier ones at the top. I realize they will move around a bunch, but the zipper is smooth as I mentioned before so it shouldnt be hard to adjust later if needed.She loves her new chair and actually slept on it two nights ago.I would buy this again.",
