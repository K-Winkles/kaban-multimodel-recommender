She and I were able to put it together, no problem! I did have to look online to see an actual picture (instead of just a drawing) as the instructions do not include any written instructions, just line drawings. It is sturdy, looks great in her closet, and holds a ton of stuff! Very happy with this purchase.",

The connector pieces allow you to build it however you want, including buying another set to snap onto the original so you can have 6x6 if you truly want. I was expecting these to be cloth, but these are very sturdy plastic.One tip though: make sure you *really* push down on the pieces into the connector pieces to get them to snap in all the way. I didn't push down all the way and had to dissemble midway because my corner pieces weren't reaching the plastic pieces.",

I read the listing carefully and which is what you need to do.This cube is designed for storing home items, clothes, books, and personal favorite items (which is what it states in the listing, and that is just what it should be used for.It was neatly packed for me. Directions were easy to read and follow. Also came with mounting for the wall. For what I needed I did not have to use the straps. It came with extra parts also easy to take apart to reconfigureDid not take but 1/2 hour to 45 mins. to put together. The most consuming time was taking the parts out of the packages.As far as people saying it is not sturdy that depends on what you have in mind to put on the shelves. What it says about the weight is accurate and the measurements so if you read them then there should be no bad reviews unless it comes defective then just get a return and order another ( Company is good about returns since I had to do that)..THINGS HAPPEN",

The second one the bars on a majority of the square pieces had been bent so they didn\u2019t really click into place how they should have. I have it put together but one swift sneeze towards the thing might just make it come down.",

If we still build the shelves in our closet, we will use these somewhere else in the house. We got the gray that is translucent and it is very nice. These are men's size large sweaters in the photo.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this for the long top shelf of a closet that I wanted to make more useful. It worked the way I wanted it to. Made multiple compartments and added more usage to the closet. But because I was using it for a shelf I didn't need the leg connectors at the bottom (would make it too tall). I needed it to sit flat on the existing shelf. Because I didn't use the leg connectors along the bottom I ran out of the main connectors. I had to use some of the leg connectors upside down on the top shelf because I ran out of the main connectors. They should include an extra package of these connectors because not everyone needs to put legs on the bottom of the unit. Also, the connectors are not easy to connect as the video claims. No way is this a \"ten minute\" project. It does get easier once you get the hang of it, but not as easy as product description and videos claim.If you can't find instructions, look in between the panels. I too thought they forgot to pack them and found them there.Also, in terms of stability, I see some complaints about the flimsiness. These are not wood cubicles. If you are looking for something that holds a lot of weight these are not what you want. They are good for holding clothes, shoes, pocketbooks, etc.",
