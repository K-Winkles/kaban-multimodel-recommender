My couch is 5 years old and looks almost new, but I always sit in the same spot and it was really getting low there. I had this problem years ago with a couch of this same brand and the company re stuffed it for me at no cost. However, I had to pay for shipping, and that was $60, so much for no cost, right? Plus I had to wait for neatly 2 months to get it back. So I decided to try this first and I think it is perfect. Don\u2019t know how long it will last, but even if I have to buy another it will still save money,",
