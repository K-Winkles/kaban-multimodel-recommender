The supports are supposed to have little tabs at the top and bottom of each ask to hold them in place, but after putting one pair of shoes in each level, the bottom supports cracked and broke. This may be a good solution if you\u2019re looking to only store flip-flops but if you try to store heels or normal shoes on the rack, they are too heavy for the supports to manage. I attempted to contact Amazon for a refund or replacement, but in order for that to happen, I would have to disassemble it take out the shoes that are still in it and reassemble. This was purchased to save time and space, and had the opposite effect.",
