                "reviewText": "This bookshelf exceeded my expectations! Solid & sturdy, well-made, great looking and hands-down the easiest furniture assembly EVER!I was looking for a credenza-ish bookshelf to take the place of a little-used desk + bookcase from another room in the house. Needed it to hold a printer & books, not stick out into the room too far, and look nice - and this does all 3!The packaging was great; the bookshelf was well protected & in perfect condition. The parts were pre-sorted and labeled which I appreciated and all the tools needed for assembly were included (a Phillips head screwdriver, a flat head screwdriver and an Allen wrench).The instructions were so easy to follow - both the written instructions and the pictures! The best tip - and it's printed on pretty much every page of the instructions - is not to tighten things 100% until the whole bookcase is put together which helps ensure things line up easily throughout the assembly. And where you do need to tighten it 100% and not wait 'til the end, it CLEARLY says so in the specific instruction step. The instructions pointed out important details like making sure pieces were facing the correct way, giving you concrete identifiers to make sure you had it right (for example: \"make sure the side facing up has 13 holes\" - and one side clearly had 13 while the other side did not).From unpacking to completion it only took about an hour and 15min and my frustration level was ZERO. I even told my partner I was actually ENJOYING putting it together!The rustic look is great, the metal ends are attractive and there's a 3rd hidden, adjustable height leg under the center of the bookshelf that adds stability/support in the middle. The measurements shown online are accurate & it fit in our space perfectly.",

The pictures that I posted were taken at night with a flash on, so the actual wood color is darker than what is shown in the close up picture that I took of a shelf. The other 2 pictures are a more accurate depiction. The color is like a dark walnut. This is not solid wood (engineered wood, I believe), but the wood grain pattern on it looks very realistic. The unit is very heavy, because of the (matted black) solid steel frame and the thick shelves. It does not wobble at all and looks like a nice piece of furniture. I'm totally pleased with this and may take a peak at their matching pieces now.",
