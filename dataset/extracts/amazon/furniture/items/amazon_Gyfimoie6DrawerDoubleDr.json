However once I started to put it together, it went pretty fast and very smooth. One person can complete the assembly. As most steps were repetitive, it didn\u2019t seem tedious. Instructions were very clear. All tools needed were included and I used my power driver to make it easier and faster. The back boards and under boards for draws are thin but not too flimsy. Rest of the dresser was all thick material. Once assembled it looks really nice. The in built power outlets are a plus. Very convenient and it has two usb ports too. The color changing lights add a nice touch to the dresser.",

The dresser looks good has a nice color and all the drawers are of good size and useful. The height is proper and the lights are an additional feature. The quality is good for the price also has additional screws that can be fixed to wall if required. The mobile app for light is straightforward. Overall a good deal.",

I\u2019ve put together too many furniture items within the last year or so and I\u2019ve gotta say that what pleases me the most about this dresser is how smooth its drawers function. Most times, I end up complaining of drawers not sliding smoothly or not getting all the way to the back. These ones, they all do function perfectly. That being said, assembly was not the easiest of all, not super complicated but a bit lengthy and it certainly requires two people. Every piece was properly marked and it brought extra of almost every screw in case you mess them up. It took me about an hour more than I expected it to assembly. Overall, it looks very very nice, boards seems sturdy and good quality. I was impressed that, in contrast with other items I\u2019ve purchased before, the led lights had its own craved into the Board canal, in which they fit perfectly and even brought little flaps to keep it inside the rail, so very little chances the led strip would fall or detach. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the look, quality and functionality. I could use s bit more height in each drawer space but for the purpose of clothes, underwear, etc worked very well",

I shamefully did not, this was for one of my kids room so was not too worried about it. The drawers are pretty small but as listed on the page, so that\u2019s on me. The other issue was that there were several scapes (below paint) and some micro scratches in the paint, most likely during shipping and friction. I contacted the seller and they were fast to respond to help take care of the issue. That\u2019s why I\u2019m giving this the 4 stars instead of 1. Also, my son loves it, we mounted his tv on the wall above and the top led boxes are big enough to fit his Xbox and controlllers on one side.",

I filled it up with my son\u2019s clothes and it got but heavy and even than i was able to move the drawers easily. Moving it across will be difficult and would need coupe of people to lift. The wood didn\u2019t chip while screwing which happens with me often with poorly engineered wood.The finish is elegant and looks and feel nice but I wish i would have come with handles on the drawers as it get tough when the drawers are full with clothes",
