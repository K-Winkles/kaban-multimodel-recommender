                "reviewText": "I just recieved these two tables and assembled them. I was a little confused on how to put the lower shelf because the holes are two on the side and two on the front and then I realized I had to rotate the legs of the table to match the hole inserts on the lower shelf and then insert the screws and they fit perfectly. The tables came in perfect condition and I really like them. They look beautiful in my living room. My family and I have already started using them to hold our drinks and I also placed a small plant with flowers on it. I put a small basket on the lower shelf which holds our T.V. remotes and I have already gotten alot of great compliments about the tables. The tables were very easy to assemble and by the time I was done I realized I stripped the little tool that screws in all the screws, for this tool they give you to tighten the bolts worked just long enough to build both tables, luckily I had another tool from a previous table I built just in case but everything worked out fine. These tables are one inch shorter then my other tables that I own but since I knew the measurements before buying them I expected them to be shorter. Their height is perfect for my needs and these tables are lovely. I like that the bottom feet of the tables are adjustable and the table feels sturdy. It arrived early and in perfect condition. I highly recommend this brand and this seller. I am very happy with my new tables.",

                "reviewText": "Ok, I review restaurants frequently, but I almost never get on Amazon to review purchases - this is a huge exception. I looked for literally weeks to find small tables that would be suitable for a laptop desk when I'm working from my lounge area, and there were so many that were wrong height, too big, would not fit under my low-sitting couches, too expensive, you name it. I originally wanted an adjustable height table, but really didn't want a hospital bedside table as part of my decor. Then I came across these little lovlies, and they are exactly what I was looking for. Perfect height, well-made and on the minimalist side but very attractive (beautiful wood, in fact) and super sturdy and high quality! The price of tables like these at other stores were $50 each, but I got these for $45 for the pair, and I assembled them in under an hour. Instructions were super easy and clear, I'm very VERY happy with these and definitely recommend. And you can see from the pictures, I like to to sit cross-legged and I have plenty of room to spare. These are just great, excellent purchase!",

Only issue manufacturer needs to be aware of is that instead of eight 'B' screws, there were only four. There were sixteen 'G' screws. The 'G' screws cannot be used in place of the 'B' screws. Lucky for me, I had extra screws in a tool box that worked fine. Other than that - these tables are great and I highly recommend them.",
