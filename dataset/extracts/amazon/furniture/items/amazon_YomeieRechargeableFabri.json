This tool was a lifesaver! I\u2019ve done 2 sweaters and a wool blend jacket so far and I\u2019m so glad I put forth the effort to try this tool. I like that it runs on batteries too. I can\u2019t stand having to charge a device that is dead or near dead when it\u2019s time for me to use it. For this price; you can\u2019t beat it. Buy one. You\u2019ll love it.",

No way I was going to take all the fluff balls by hand. Now my garment looks new again. Easy to use & caught all the mess in the compartment. I had to use it like 4 times & empty the container. But it did the job fast & easy. Blades are very sharp. So no need to pass over a second time. It comes with extra blades to use once they become dull.",

                "reviewText": "I had another fabric shaver from the dollar store which helped a little, but of course, it broke. I decided to try out this one in the hopes it would do a better job and be higher quality. Fortunately, that\u2019s the case!I have many sweaters that get those annoying balls of fabric all over, which makes them look old and worn. As soon as I got this fabric shaver I got to work on my sweaters, and it did indeed remove them!! It\u2019s not difficult, I just have to go back and forth over the area a few times to get it all. I was a little worried that the shaver might damage a couple of my more delicate sweaters (as was the case with my old shaver) but luckily it didn\u2019t! My sweaters look so much better now!! I also had a couple of pillow cases that were really bad, and though it took several minutes, I was able to get them all off!! What a huge difference it made in both the look and feel of the pillow cases. The shaver is a bit loud, but it\u2019s not a big deal to me. I\u2019ve used the shaver for quite a while and haven\u2019t needed to charge the battery yet, so I would say it has good battery life.To sum up, this fabric shaver works well, and hasn\u2019t damaged my clothes! I have no complaints. Works as advertised.Hope this helped! \ud83d\ude0a",

You know those sweaters that have been in the dryer too many times and they begin to get those little white/gray/black balls of \"fuzz\" on them? This will take care of that for you.

Re-install the mesh grill and turn the device on and start shaving your garment. It does not pull, snag or catch to cause a run it simply \"shaves\" the garment to rid it of its fuzz. Easy charge LED indicator is Red when it needs a charge and green when fully charged. Comes with a USB-C 6\" charging cable, three different depth blades a brush to clean the blades after use and an easy to follow instruction manual. The refuse bin is easy to remove and empty just slide down to unlock and continue sliding downwards until it is detached, empty the bin a replace.",
