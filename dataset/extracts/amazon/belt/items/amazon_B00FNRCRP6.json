                "reviewText": "bought this for my husband whose 300+lbs and is allergic to the metal materials used in belt buckles. He used to get rashes and break out from metal belt buckles and hasn't since using this belt. he's been using it for over a month now and it is kind of hard to use at first because its stiff but it works well for the most part. he states that it does not stay tight around his waist for too long before he has to tighten it again do to there being no belt loop holes. but he states that he likes this belt way more than his previous belts with belt loops. its also easier to use the restroom with this belt. The only reason i didn't give this 5 stars is because it doesn't stay tight before having to retighten it or readjust after too long of wearing it. i bought a size 2X for him and he wears a size 42-44 in jeans. fits good, not a whole lot of room for slack so if you like slack i would go up a size.",

                "reviewText": "I've been wearing the 5.11 version of this belt for probably 20 years, but recent health issues have caused me to gain enough weight that it's not long enough anymore, and they don't make a longer one.I found the Tru-Spec belt and as soon as I verified the sizing info, I bought it. The nylon at this point is a fair bit stiffer than I remember my 5.11 belt being, however I'm sure with a few washes and a few months of use it'll get nice and supple.Overall, at this point, I am extremely satisfied. I'll try to remember to update this review in a year or so to attest to it's durability.",

                "reviewText": "Upon reading reviews, there's a hidden pocket built in, and I have no idea why it exists either. You can fit maybe a couple quarters, but that's it.Anyways, on to the product itself, there's not much to say, and for good reason. The width of the belt's neck is fairly bulky compared to some other nylon belts I have, but quite frankly it still fits, and does so very snugly. This helps it bear a load of weight with increased efficiency, I've come to realize, but it is not particularly comfortable if sitting down or needing mobility for long periods of time. However, that's not the point of this belt.In terms of function, it has no moving parts, which is perfect, and it's fast to put on, adjust, and it doesn't come loose. If you want this belt for rugged purposes, it does the job. Period. This isn't hard to come by in nylon belts, but the one I got in coyote brown looks bronze, given nylon's luster, and is quite good looking, too. Not the best looking nylon belt I've seen, but better than some.For serious use, I don't know what else you could possibly want.",
