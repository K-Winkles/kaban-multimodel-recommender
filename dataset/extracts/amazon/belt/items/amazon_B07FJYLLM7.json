It highly match my attire, can be worn as dress up or everyday business belt and is compatible with suit, jeans or slacks. It is totally beyond my expectation. I love this belt.",

Only sold in even sizes. I normally wear a 33\" belt which fits just right. I wanted a 33\" but the closest sizes in this brand are a 32\" and a 34\". I bought a 34\" and it is too long, I then bought a 32\" and I can wear it, but it is a little too short. So, if this belt came in a 33\" size, I would have bought two more, but I will look for an alternative in my ideal size, 33\".",
