                "reviewText": "Boy were the reviews I read.... \"interesting!\". Lots of contradicting tails of woe, mostly about sizing, material & smell.Well... my goal was to replace a somewhat fancy (actual) black braided-leather belt after maybe 15 years of occasional use. Just started tearing, a few of the individual slats, old age. So basically I wanted at least somewhat stylish belt for black pants, casual and more bizzy. So....Material/Appearance: First reaction was \"stiff?!\" - Unrolling it the belt felt rather stiff, but it's new, so...The appearance is nice with the \"leather\" over buckle mid-bar, though the buckle itself is big & casual, as the belt is on the wider side too. Works with both jeans and black chinos fine. Probably not super-formal.Now the thing is, this belt is not \"braided leather\". Not sure about the leather, but before that I must say (though none of the other comments I read mentioned it; \"maybe it's just me?\") - there are rows of holes lined up with \"braid simulation\" giving the illusion (at a distance) of it being a braided belt. It's not. But hopefully people are not going to have their faces that close to it, if worried about the other big review comment: the smell. At first I didn't smell a thing and was curious. I have a good sense of smell, and when I held it up and inhaled, wow! High-powered aroma, and very much the essence of how it smells in my tiny neighborhood leather/shoe repair shoppe. Real or sprayed smell? Can't say. And so far can't understand (in my scientist hat) why the \"leather\" looks lacquered or varnished, and so stiff and so smelly (up close, that is; really not that noticeable except an inch away). Fun reviews....So the big question is value... Some say it's going to peel apart in minutes or weeks. \"We'll see\". I'll be wearing this with heavy jeans, and other belts with lighter or browner pants. I'll know in weeks to months, maybe, if it peels apart or is just a bit \"unique\" in its fabrication. (It does *say* leather, but if it's all in a top lacquered layer over \"other\" material, can't say. Time will tell. Meanwhile I got the slightly larger size (38+) despite that being on the large size, because I'd rather have extra room than being squeezed. Turns out there were 3-4 inches beyond the buckle and that worked out perfectly for loops, so the sizing was right, the smell was leather, and I'm hoping this will keep my jeans up!",

                "reviewText": "I've been wearing these for several years now. They are extremely comfortable; much more supple than a solid leather belt. And they look good in all color variations too.As with all braided belts, the lacing may eventually break in a high-wear spot (like at a belt loop), but I typically get about 3-4 years out of one before that happens. And that is perfectly acceptable to me as a trade-off for being so pleasant to wear.First time I bought one of these I wasn't sure I liked the leather cover on the buckle and thought about cutting off. I never did because it turned out to be a very nice touch that keeps the clasp from rattling and makes the belt slide through just that much easier when putting it on.I also like the expending sizes available. I prefer some excess \"tail\" in order to tuck the tongue not only into the keeper on the belt, but also into the next belt loop of my pants. So and oversized belt is a must for me, though not that easy to find when you're already venturing into \"big & tall\" sizing.All in all, highly recommended. Nice looking. Comfortable. And a very good value.",
