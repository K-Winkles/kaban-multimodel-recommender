                "reviewText": "Like we said, What a nice belt. It is nice looking and it says it is leather on it but it has a foam core that adds stiffness but also suppleness at the same time. Changing from one side to another is a simple twist of the buckle. The buckle has a nice pewter finish that goes with many things. It was easy to cut off lenght to make this belt perfect to wear. Simply move the buckle to a half way position exposing to small slots, insert a flat head screw driver, I used the little flat head attached to the can opener on a Swiss Army Knife. Pop this part up from the buckle side not the belt side exposing the little spikes that grab the belt material. Remove the belt, cut off what you want to, creating a square cut is best, I used my leatherman medical shears to do this, reinsert the belt, snap the holder closed and rotate the buckle to whatever side you want. It as that easy. I am adding all of these instructions here incase I misplace the ones that came with the belt. The belt itself is good looking and thin enough to fit in Chino's or Docker's style pants but it also gives good support. The brown color is a medium brown and the black is .... well black. This will be an everyday belt for office wear. Remember, this is a dress belt, casual dress belt and not a tactical belt so I do not think that it would be good for carrying any tools on it of any kind.",
