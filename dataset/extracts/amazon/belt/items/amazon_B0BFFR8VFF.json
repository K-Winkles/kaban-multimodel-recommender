I had wanted a brass color at first, but they don't offer that, so I went with the polished nickel and it was fine. It's nice enough looking that you can wear it with whatever you need to, and it's functional as well. I went with the X-Large version and I probably had *somewhere* around a 38 waist at the time and it was just about right (it's come down significantly since then and I'm nearing the end of the holes, but it's still doing the job as my pants start to fall off my waist unless they have help).",

It\u2019s a nice looking belt and would be fine for occasional use for formal occasions but doesn\u2019t stand up to daily wear.",
