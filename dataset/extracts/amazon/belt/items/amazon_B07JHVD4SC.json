The buckle is also larger than I anticipated and a little clunky, but overall seems well made. The belt itself is definitely not as well made as old military web belts but it seems sturdy enough. Time will tell but overall I\u2019m happy with the purchase. The selection of colors was good and I was happy to find the combo I wanted. The black is faintly dark blue black but it works well enough for everyday and outdoors clothes.",

You can trim it off to the size you need and not much stretch to it. The stretch one I have had don't last long.Dollar for dollar compared to other similar belts I have ordered this is better than the one I paid 5x as much for.I will be ordering another so I have it, I have had problems with reordering any hting that is good quality from Amazon a moth later because it seems like Amazon never restocks quality products.",

I have another belt of this style that is Levis brand, and it has lasted about ten years and it has not frayed or started to pill like these have. But, overall if you're looking for an inexpensive casual belt to keep your pants up this is not a bad way to go. I like the fact that there are two colours in the same package, and I like the way they fit and can be adjusted to any size.",
