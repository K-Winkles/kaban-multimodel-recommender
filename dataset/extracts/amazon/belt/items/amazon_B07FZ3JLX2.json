Other belts have let my pants slip when running, etc. If you're looking for a belt like this, you likely already know you want it. This is the third one of this style of belt I've used and I personally wouldn't want to wear any other style. Nothing is wrong with the belt, I just have lost a considerable amount of weight making new belts necessary if I don't want the tail looping around behind me. Looks nice.",

                "reviewText": "These belts were purchased 3 belts to replace 3 that had become too long due to stretching and weight loss. Looking at the pictures for comparison, the bottom 3 belts were ordered at the same time, and the top belt is one that I am replacing. All were measured from the area where the belt buckle is attached to the leather & webbing. A size 38 was ordered to fit a size 36 pants (as noted in the sizing table on Amazon), and the expectation was that these belts would be 2 inches shorter than the size 40 they were replacing. First, the size 40 belt had increased to about 46 1/2 inches in length. As can be seen in the photos, the bottom blue belt is 43 1/2 inches, the khaki belt is about 44 1/2 inches, and the black belt is 46 inches in length. All of the belts ordered reflect they are size 38 on the back of the leather. Thus, I don't know if a size 38 is supposed to be 38 inches or 43 1/2 inches. The quality control in the sizing is lacking.The 2 lower belts fit OK, but the black belt is essentially the same length as the size 40 shown in the picture.There is one other issues with the belts worth noting, though it is not necessarily a fault of the product manufacturer. With the exception of larger belt loops (such as blue jeans), the leather end tab of the belt gets hung on most belt loops when taking the belt off or having to retighten the belt. It's a nuisance and I don't like it, but I also wear other pants besides blue jeans.The quality of the product is exceptional. I have purchased web belts in nationally known, higher quality department stores that are not as well made and cost 2 - 3 times as much. I wear these type belts daily unless I am needing to wear pants that require a leather belt for the occasion. And, I will buy these again. When I order again, I will order a size 36 in lieu of a size 38.I would have rated these a strong 5 had it not been for the quality control in the sizing / length of the belts.UPDATE: I recently purchased a size 36 belt for a size 36 pants in lieu of a size 38 belt. The belt is a better fit, BUT,...the size 36 belt is only an inch shorter than the size 38 belt even though the size 38 has stretched somewhat. I ordered both a tan and black belt. The tan belt was about an inch shorter than its predecessor, and the black belt was only about 1/2 more short. I like the belts, but question whether or not the quality control on the lengths are tight enough.",
