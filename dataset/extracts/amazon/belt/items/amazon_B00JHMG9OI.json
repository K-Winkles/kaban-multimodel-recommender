Never realized how nice a system it was until I started seeing ads for expensive ratchet buckle belt sets. I wear belts a lot for work and just in general and tend to wear out belts. The leather tends to crack, holes wear out, new holes drilled cuz I lost weight, new belt needed cuz I gained weight. This buckle can be positioned on the belt wherever you like, there is no hole to wear out because the buckle uses a friction bar. Need a new color? Slide the buckle off and put it on another belt. The canvas web belts are inexpensive, last forever and easy to store. This set comes with 3 neutral colors that so far go with just about everything I own.",

                "reviewText": "I was disappointed. Leave my jeans are the greatest so I figured the Belt would be the greatest but it was not. The pictures are misleading it comes with just one buckle not three. The size is little bit smaller than what is described. The only good part is that because the belts are actually smaller than described I did not need to do any cutting. The biggest appointment is the buckle. The one buckle that came with these spells doesn't work very well. It works okay when you put the belt on, but when you need to undo the buckle it gets stuck and takes quite a bit of effort and can take up to about 30 seconds or more. I will not buy again.",

                "reviewText": "I needed some new web belts and this 3-pack looked like the best deal, from a well-known brand to boot. How wrong I was! When the belts arrived, they included ONLY 1 BUCKLE \u2014 totally unlike the product photos I was positive that I remembered correctly. I went back to the website description, and sure enough they repeatedly show you 3 buckles, and then they DO let you know there\u2019s only 1 buckle included \u2014 WAY DOWN in the 5th bullet point. To add insult to injury, these belts BARELY fit 42\u201d. I also recently bought a good Columbia brand dress belt, and that one \u2014 listed at the same exact size of 42\u201d \u2014 is several inches longer, allowing adequate belt length through the buckle and then to the first belt loop on my pants, which is exactly what I expected. Although these belts ARE 42\u201d long, they barely reach through the buckle for fastening. I\u2019m incredibly disappointed in both the marketing for this product as well as the product itself from a brand I\u2019ve trusted for decades.",
