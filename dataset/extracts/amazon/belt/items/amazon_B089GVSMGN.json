It feels secure without restricting movement, which is essential for hiking or any physical activity.The no-metal design is a big plus, especially for those who are sensitive to metal or need to pass through metal detectors without hassle. It's a simple feature that makes a big difference in convenience.Aesthetically, these belts look nice. They have a sleek, low-profile appearance that pairs well with various outfits. Whether I'm hitting the trails or running errands around town, these belts add a touch of style without being overly noticeable. They blend in just right, enhancing the overall look.What I appreciate most about the HOANAN Elastic Stretch Belts is how they fulfill a specific need without sacrificing style or comfort. They're exactly what I was looking for and have quickly become a staple in my wardrobe.If you're in search of a no-fuss, no-metal, comfortable belt that looks good and fits well, the HOANAN 2-Pack Elastic Stretch Belt is a top choice. These belts meet and exceed expectations, and I'm glad I found them!",

                "reviewText": "I bought these because stretch belts are so, so much better than regular belts. They hold up your pants without constricting you because they're always just applying constant gentle pressure. The J. Crew woven stretch belt is a perfect example of a stretchy belt like this. They're so much more comfortable than regular belts, and do a better job of holding up your pants too!Unfortunately, these are *not* stretch like that. These are basically regular nylon belts that start to stretch only when you apply *extreme* force, and they don't stretch that much either. Maybe call it \"emergency stretch\". When you're walking around normally, there's zero stretch. You have to tighten it the same as a regular belt. The only situation they'll stretch is if you're folding your body in half like a plumber to fix something under the sink.So maybe they're good for that, if you find yourself folding your body in half constantly? But otherwise, if you're just doing regular walking/driving/hiking, there is absolutely no \"stretch\" that you will experience. They will act just like a regular, non-stretch belt. These should not be advertised as \"stretch\" in a way that makes you think they're going to be like the other stretch clothing/belts we're used to.",

As others have said the little wrap on the end of the belt makes it difficult to thread through the buckle and it was a bit longer than I prefer.
