Being just a bit overweight, I have to ratchet the belt tight to keep slacks in place. The distance between holes in a leather just do not work. The only problem I have had is that the clasp holding the fixed end has opened three times. Don't know what I did to make it happen so I expect it will open again. No problem to reinsert if it doesn't fall off in the toilet. Good belt and definitely priced right.",
