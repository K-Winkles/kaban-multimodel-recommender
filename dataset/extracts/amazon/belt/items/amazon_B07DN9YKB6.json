                "reviewText": "I don't know what happened, but jeans don't fit me anymore. Rather they do at first, in the store, when I try them on to buy. Even being hung to dry, the stretch disappears. I'm left wearing denim anchors that require constant pulling up. I can't stand it! My pile of disappointment was headed for thrift. Then I saw this belt. With no cumbersome buckle to leave me peeing my pants in a moment of urgency (did I mention menopause). It stretches greatly, so no binding leather cutting you in half ever time you sit down. Best of all. This thing works!! I didn't even think about my pants for hours. Then, just to realize I hadn't had to pull them up. Oh the Joy! I now have lots of jeans that fit. These will also provide extended wear during weight loss. Once you get the adjustment right, they cinch all around while leaving the front smooth. Great idea, great product!",

                "reviewText": "This belt is so minimal and unobtrusive, I love not getting things caught on a belt buckle or having it print awkwardly through my shirts anymore. I wear size 34 waist pants and bought the 24-35\" which fits perfectly. Also the softness and elasticity is so comfortable, I don't have to adjust when I sit down/stand up. I don't pull mine very tight, but if you did it may tear the belt loops on fragile pants. Overall this resolved a daily annoyance for me, so well worth it.",

The bonus for me is, let\u2019s face it, I\u2019m getting older and sometimes when I gotta go, I gotta go and having no buckle to fumble with has certainly saved me several times.
