It is surpirsingly sturdy with a tight weave and great buckle/teeth action that prevents slippage. So far the only small drawback is the release trigger, when removing the belt, as it takes a lot more pressure than expected to pop open the buckle. Overall good product.",

The belt is a tightly woven, thick, and heavy duty webbing but when worn is very comfortable and stays tight with a ratcheting belt buckle lock that is pure genius. I'm going to buy one or two more for myself and buy more as gifts. It comes in a really nice box good enough to give as a gift.",

Very fast delivery, looked exactly like what I ordered, and was the correct size. I love the way you quickly slide the belt end through the buckle devise, and it stays exactly where you stop pulling. If it\u2019s a little tight (and who\u2019s isn\u2019t) simply depress the collars on the sides and release. Easy on easy off and holds my CCW secured. Definitely going to order more of these.",

Can't say how long it will last, as there are metal teeth which grip the nylon belt surface each time you tighten the belt. And they grip the belt in the same place each time, as you are tightening the belt to the same tension each wearing. Time will tell, but for this price, I'm super happy thus far.",
