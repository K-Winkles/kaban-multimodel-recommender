No stiffness at all. One snap doesn't want to stay closed all the time but that's not a big problem. The fold where the snaps are was also already folded & broken in. I ordered a slightly longer size than I needed because my waist fluctuates sometimes so I wanted a little extra length, just in case. It was the exact right length that I ordered. I love this belt! Would definitely buy again!",

Only reason i\u2019m getting a new one is the snaps are getting really worn and feel like they\u2019re going to pull through. I switch belt buckles about every two weeks. Warping is my fault I tend to rest stuff on it and put holsters and hammer clips on it. Also I punched extra holes. You can\u2019t beat it for the money",
