Method B is quick and easy and should work for almost everyone. Just choose the pant size you normally wear and add 2 inches.

                "reviewText": "This belt is really well made from full-grain leather. It\u2019s going to last a long time. It\u2019s thick yet not too heavy and if you follow the instructions on how to pick your size, the belt will fit perfectly.Some people have complained about the buckle that comes on the belt looks like it\u2019s tarnished or not an even color. The buckle is made from brass and is going to patina over time into a beautiful color. My belt arrived looking how others described it, but after a few weeks of daily wear, the discoloration has already gone away.Time will tell if the belt withstands stretching with use. I hope the inside of the belt has anti-stretch material but we\u2019ll see. For the very fair price I paid, I\u2019m very happy with this belt. I would\u2019ve paid more for it actually.",

I went with the size indicator for the belt which says to go a size up from from the pant size you wear I think. I should have went a size down, the material will stretch out a little bit upon daily wear. Which took me to the last hole on the belt, in fact, I just added an extra hole to keep my pants up. Also, the paint on the belt buckle over time comes off, which left a black mark on my under belly. I am 6'1\" @340lbs, so far this belt after a few months is working. So yes, I would recommend buying this belt. Life time warranty on the belt is impressive.",

Could be my high expectations that a belt look good.Well I appear to have found the answer. I have now had this belt for over six months and it looks just like when I got it. It is strong. It feels great. The eyes don't stretch out. It has worked with every pair of pants and shorts I own; although its width and thickness will make for a tighter fit slipping through some loops.I would highly recommend this belt.",
