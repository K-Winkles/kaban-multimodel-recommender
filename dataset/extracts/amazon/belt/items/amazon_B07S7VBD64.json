The only issue is the \u201ckeeper loop\u201d is made cheaply and falls apart after a few months of wear (see picture). Strange since the other 99% of the belt is almost indestructible. If a small change is made in the design this would be a lifetime product for myself and my construction crews. Please let us know if this can happen. Thank you.",

This well-made, good looking belt came in a carefully fitted plastic sleeve, inside a hard-sided cardboard fitted case, inside a well made draw-string bag. The care shown in packing indicates the company's care for this product and it shows in the workmanship. Beautiful quality for an inexpensive belt, and great colors to wear with jeans and leather shoes. I would recommend this without reservation. Fits me easily (female) -just wish there was an option for a gold buckle or a slightly smaller buckle. Beyond that - it exceeded expectations.",
