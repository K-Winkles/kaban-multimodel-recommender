I bought this new belt, first time owning a ratcheting belt, keep in mind.Once the belt arrives, I pull it out of the package. It\u2019s a very clean and nice looking belt. I quickly loop it around my waist and insert the tab into the slot and pull the ratchet up tight\u2026\u2026..with no way of knowing how to undo the stupid thing!!!!I had it pulled so tight that I couldn\u2019t see how to get it loose either. My wife laughing heartily at me for being a knucklehead at immediately pulling this belt up tight and not reading the instructions first.After almost passing out from the squeeze, I finally allow my wife to help. There is a little lever under the buckle that allows the ratchet to clear and the belt to loosen. Understand that I am a bigger guy, 6ft and 250, prior service in the Army and a bulldozer mentality. The belt held back my panic tirade!The belt? Great! Strong, clean, smooth. Love it!The little tiny lever that you can\u2019t put your fingers on to release the belt after you pull it up so tight that you can barely breathe? Whew!!!Please, do laugh at my expense, I earned this one, boys!",

                "reviewText": "The belt fits and looks great. It's got a nice tapered end which slides into the loops easily, and I love the locking mechanism, which is so much easier to use, and over time would cause less stress on the leather itself. And I also love the way that the belt buckle kind of protects and in cases my top button. My only real complaint is the trigger which unlocks the clicking mechanism. It's a little stiff and hard to release, but it also feels small & flimsy and seems like it could potentially break easily, so we'll see how this thing works out in long run.",
