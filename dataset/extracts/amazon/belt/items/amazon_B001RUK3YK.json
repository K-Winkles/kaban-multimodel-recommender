                "reviewText": "I purchased this same size belt maybe 5 years ago at a Dockers store in a mall; and I've worn it an average of one day per week. It is now starting to fray along the edges, so I ordered a replacement belt from Amazon. This replacement is more flexible than the belt I got from Dockers, and that addressed the only concern I had about the first belt. This belt allows me to adjust tightness around my waist for many events, such as: When standing up I can easily tighten the belt so it stays over my hips, and when sitting down I can loosen the belt for added comfort. When putting on a quilted shirt (say if the weather cools off) I can tuck it in my trousers and loosen the belt; when removing the shirt (say if I'm being more active) I can easily tighten the belt. I have a braided belt that does not have actual buckle holes all along it's spine like this Dockers belt has, yet I can adjust tightness with the braided belt; however, it is tricky getting the buckle rod (?) through the webbing and centered on the braided belt; plus, the braided belt looks frayed along the area where the buckle rod has gone in and out many times. The Dockers belt does not show wear around the holes where the buckle rod is placed. Of course, you can always adjust the tightness of a belt with holes every inch or so; however, each pair of trousers has a different thickness of material between the belt and your body; therefore, this belt with holes every quarter inch along its entire length provides maximum adjustability for every pair of trousers.",

                "reviewText": "I like braided leather belts. Dockers makes a fine one with many holes for precise fit. This belt is a quality item.The problem is that braided leather belts are a poor design. They tend to stretch out and the small braids tear. Eventually the belt looks bad. And you gotta get a new one. Just comes with the territory. I don't think there's a way around this with a braided leather design. But darnit! I still like them. They just don't last forever.By the way, stretch is a very strange thing to rate in a leather belt. If it's too stretched to fit correctly, you have to adjust how you buckle the belt.",

Only negative is you\u2019ll need to own a couple and rotate them because with daily use they don\u2019t last very long. I guess because the leather is soft the holes give out over a short time of use. Then you\u2019ll have to go tighter or looser to find a sturdy hole.
