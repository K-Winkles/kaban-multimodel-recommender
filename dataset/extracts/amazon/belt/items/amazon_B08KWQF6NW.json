Our tactical belt began with our proprietary webbing, engineered with just the right amount of stretch to keep you secure, yet comfortable. We then added the world\u2019s best belt buckle that clicks seamlessly into place using rare-earth neodymium magnets set in an A380 aluminum alloy.",

            "NO BS WARRANTY - Adventure and innovation are at the core of who we are. Groove Life products are driven by those values and are designed for a lifestyle of adventure. In the event you adventure too far, and you feel like your Groove product is not living up to your standards, we\u2019ll do what we can to make it right. Our 94 Year No BS Warranty covers any manufacturing damages to your belt. If it's not our bad, (lost, torn, cosmetic, etc.) we\u2019ll cover that too! Replacement fees and taxes may apply.",

It is safe for use around your phone. We do not recommend our belt if you have a pacemaker or any other medical device that may be affected by magnetic fields. Will the belt set off metal detectors? Are they TSA approved? Yes, they are subject to setting off metal detectors and are not TSA approved. We advise you to remove your belt and wallet before going through the metal detector. How can I clean or care for my Groove Belt? Mild soap and warm water are all you need for cleaning! We recommend cleaning after a fair amount of wearing just to be sure dirt doesn\u2019t hang around. For the belt, a stain remover pen has also been known to do the trick. What size Groove Belt should I order? Match the belt size you order to your pant size! If you're at the high end or on the cusp of a size, we recommend sticking with the size down. For example, if you're right at 36\" or right at 37\", we'd recommend ordering a medium.",

I have had ratchet belts break open on me or the straps start to sever over time. Because this has a slight stretch material is sort of moves with you and stays in place.

I\u2019ve been eyeballing the purchase of one of these for a really long time and finally decided to get one after I finished killing off my 3rd leather belt this year.This is a product that every person needs to own. It practically feels like you\u2019re not wearing it and it is unbelievably comfortable. The fastening mechanism is absolutely flawless and the belt has such incredible rigidity with the most perfect amount of stretch. Set this thing up once at your desired size and you can endlessly transfer it to any pair of pants and have the same result every time.The belt buckle is classy and really high quality. I can wear this with my work pants, dress clothes or outdoor gear.I recently purchased a second because I wanted the brown belt with brown buckle to add to my collection. I was sent the incorrect belt and received the brown belt with black buckle. Still a beautiful belt but not what I ordered. I messaged GL and in less than 12 hours they sent me a new belt and told me to enjoy the one I already received at no extra cost. This company has grade A customer service and I\u2019m happy to be a customer and will continue to purchase from them in the future.",
