The belt is made with high-quality materials and the elastic stretch design ensures a comfortable fit for both men and women. The absence of a buckle also eliminates any uncomfortable pressure points or digging into the waist. The sleek design also adds a touch of elegance to our outfits. Overall, we are extremely satisfied with this purchase and would highly recommend it to others.",

This left me with baggy jeans that I was having to pull up every three steps. Stairs? Forget about it. I just had to hold my pants up the whole time I was climbing. Then I saw these belts. Let me tell you. Life. Changing. My jeans now fit snugly and require minimal pulling up, but without a belt buckle digging into my stomach or feeling like I'm being cinched in half. The belt is so comfy, you don't even know you are wearing it. Since it attaches to your belt loops, you don't have to fuss with it when taking your pants off or using the restroom. The belt comes with a ring that you can connect each side to rather than use your belt loops if you'd prefer to do it that way. I wear size 22-24 women's jeans, depending on the brand, and I didn't need to expand the belt at all for it to fit and give the support I need, but it is nice that it can be customized to the exact length you need. All in all, great purchase, and I will be a repeat customer if I need another one!",

                "reviewText": "I really liked how this belt is designed; however for me, it only somewhat works. I ordered the size belt that I normally wear and was recommended by the website, but what I received was too large to use as intended. I do believe it is the correct size when used as a conventional belt (using the ring as a closure), but when used as a partial belt that connects to the side belt loops (as it is marketed), it is way too large to be effective, even at its smallest configuration. The quality of the belt and ring is good, the stretch is great and the belt looks good in general. I'm glad the belt is designed to be used in two different ways, as I purchased it expecting to be able to use it as a partial belt and would have been very disappointed upon discovering it was not able to be used. Since my only option now is to use it as a conventional belt, I will probably replace it at some point with a dressier model with a slim buckle that is easier to thread through the belt loops. This one is a little too casual for me, and the size of the ring makes the front a little uncomfortable at times. I do wish the original concept had worked. That would have been really something.",

Works as well as a belt but it has a couple advantages, it makes my pants fit better and dose not give me a gap in back exposing my buttcrack, or a bulge in front from an awkward belt buckle, aaand when I am at work I don't have to fiddle around with my apron at all which I really like!!!",
