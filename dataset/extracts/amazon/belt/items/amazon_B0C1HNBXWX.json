We designed this belt to fit the smallest belt loops, so ladies and men can enjoy its versatility. What size Groove Belt should I order? Match the belt size you order to your pant size! If you're at the high end or on the cusp of a size, we recommend sticking with the size down. For example, if you're right at 36\" or right at 37\", we'd recommend ordering a medium. What's the strength of the Groove Belt magnet? Is it safe around pacemakers, phones, etc? The high strength neodymium magnets are N42 magnets. It is safe for use around your phone. We do not recommend our belt if you have a pacemaker or any other medical device that may be affected by magnetic fields. Will the belt set off metal detectors? Are they TSA approved? Yes, they are subject to setting off metal detectors and are not TSA approved. We advise you to remove your belt and wallet before going through the metal detector. How can I clean or care for my Groove Belt? Mild soap and warm water are all you need for cleaning! We recommend cleaning after a fair amount of wearing just to be sure dirt doesn\u2019t hang around. For the belt, a stain remover pen has also been known to do the trick.",

                "reviewText": "So I\u2019m a bigger guy and I bought groove life belts before, about three times. each time they cut into my abdomen. The belt was very difficult to get through dickies pants belt loops because you had to use a lot of force to get it through the belt loops, so when I saw this one, I figured I would buy it. and I automatically assumed it would just be the same thing. I received it yesterday and my gosh this belt is thin, don\u2019t let the Amazon picture make you think it\u2019s just the same size one and maybe slightly thinner, this one\u2019s about half the size of the original groove life belt, so I just put it on this morning. It\u2019s incredibly easy to get through dickies belt loops, without force. it just slides right through the belt loops. the only thing I would recommend is to remove the little thing that\u2019s holding down the flap because it won\u2019t fit through the belt loops. It doesn\u2019t dig into my abdomen when I\u2019m sitting down which is amazing. it\u2019s very elastic for a belt this thin, it actually holds my pants up, which is really nice so overall I would definitely get this belt again.",

Overall it's an attractive belt but needs a more durable finish and a wider webbing.",
