                "reviewText": "I had a \"stretchy\" reversible Dockers belt that I needed to replace. This belt looked like a good alternative. It's a decent belt, and it looks good. I don't regret buying it and have been using it. However, it doesn't have as much stretch \"give\" as the Dockers (it's much less stretchy, actually). Of course, I have a 33 waist, which is right in between the two choices of belt lengths. I opted for the 34-36 length since I was worried about being a little tight in the 30 (yikes!)- 32 length. Hence, the belt is a bit too long (gotta slip the end into the pant loop), but not obscenely so.",
