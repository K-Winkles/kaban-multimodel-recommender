                "reviewText": "Its pretty nice overall, it's very nice until you feel it. From afar it looks amazing tbh. When you start using it you will feel the belt leather is kind of cheap and after a month of using it, it's not stretching like leather but looks like it could eventually crack. If it cost less, this would be a 4/5 belt. But for the price and brand i was expectingmuch better. Like i said still a pretty nice belt, i just think it could crack sooner than others, just by the way the belt is behaving as i use it every day.",
