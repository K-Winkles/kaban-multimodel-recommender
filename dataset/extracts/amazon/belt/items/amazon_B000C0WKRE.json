It's been on my vehicle for several months now and is doing the job well. Very pleased.I must mention though that the first belt that arrived was the wrong one, even though the packaging had the correct part number on the side. It did not match what was actually in the package. When I called Amazon, they sent me a replacement OVERNIGHT. VERY VERY please with how Amazon handled this!",
