I had to order 3 times and hopefully the last time will be correct. I recommend you order by their waist size and not belt size. (They give you belt and waist size for each order). For example if your other belts that fit are a size 36, buy this belt using the waist size 36 and not the belt size 36. Hope this is clear.",
