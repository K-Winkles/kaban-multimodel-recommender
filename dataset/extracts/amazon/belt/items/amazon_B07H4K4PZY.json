                "reviewText": "This is a nice ratchet belt! No more having to hope that the locations for the holes work out like you need. The material feels nice and looks good. I wear this frequently to courtrooms and it looks great. Nice thing about the ratcheting design is that it is easy to use and can be adjusted simply when you change positions (such as seated or standing) if you want some extra give or tightness depending on the circumstances.My only con is that on the buckle end (the side that is always fixed to the buckle), it can sometimes feel a little bit looser or more adjustable than it should because it\u2019s just some teeth holding it in place. But it does hold up well despite this.",

                "reviewText": "Just a heads up, I don't do a lot of reviews...I've been interested and skeptical of these type of belts for quite some time.I got a two of them (Just different color buckles) on a Lightning Deal.I've got a gut, but my waste itself seems to change frequently. Additionally I'm disabled for several physical issues including Cervical surgeries and lower back issues.The lower back issue really acts up when my shorts/pants slip down off of my actual waste during time spent on my spent on my feet for more than 30 minutes. This puts undue pressure on my lower extremities and exacerbates my lower back pain. I have belt issues, slide clamps won't ever stay tight and regular leather belts I find myself making new holes over time, but they stretch throughout the day and do not stay tight enough.I've only had it for less than a week, but I am already completely impressed!Setup and sizing was a painless ordeal thanks in part to the lightly perforated cut lines, and then all you have to do is slide it into the buckle & flip a clamp.The quality of the belt material seems similar to many belts I've purchased over the years for quite a bit more money.Most importantly the click system just works! If I need to tighten or loosen it for any reason it is simple to do. So far I have not found it to loosen throughout the day. I'll be on my feet for a while tomorrow so that will be the stress test, but I really do not expect any issues.I am not sure of the longevity of the materials. If it lasts for a year I will still consider it a five star product at its current price! If I do run into any issues prior to that I will definitely update my review to reflect my new opinion.07/12/2019 Update:So I've lost a lot of weight lately, and I think it's time to trim one of the two belts I purchased.They have not frayed or ever slipped on me thus far!!!!I will check back in a few months for another update. For me having a belt not fall apart after a few months of me cranking on it is awesome!",

                "reviewText": "Let me preface by saying how this belt works.At one end you have a plastic \"ladder\" of sorts that allows you to fasten the belt in roughly .25 inch increments. Simply pull the tail through the buckle and it's secure; push the button to release.To configure the belt to your own size, you trim off the non-ratcheting end and secure the buckle via \"teeth\" built into the buckle system.This belt lasted about 11 months for me, and i realize why.The \"spikes\" on the buckle engage to hold the belt in place once you've trimmed it down. On mine, the spikes weren't perfectly aligned (as in they weren't totally straight.) This meant that every month or so, the buckle would eat its way through the belt. After multiple trims, the belt was mostly unusable.I will say, however, that if you're looking to lose weight on a timetable, this belt might help you do that. If you're 36 inches for too long, it won't work for you.That said, if you're looking for a belt and not trying to lose weight, you might want to make sure that the belt you get has symmetrical teeth--or buy another belt.",
