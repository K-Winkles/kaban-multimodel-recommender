Standard belts are made in standard lengths with holes 1 inch apart resulting in belts that are sometimes too long, too tight, or too loose. But we all need different sizes that aren't normally 1 inch apart! Mission Belt has revolutionized the belt by removing those standard fixed buckles and holes. Our belts use a ratcheting system to allow you to customize your perfect fit by making 1/4 inch micro adjustments and we paired it with easy-to-use, stylish buckles to lock your belt in place and a quick release lever. It's time to throw away those old saggy belts and start fresh with a perfectly fitting Mission Belt.",

                "reviewText": "Mission Belt is simply the best \"ratchet style\" belt available. They are truly incredible. Mission Belt's customer service is outstanding. In fact, their customer service is the best of any company I have been a customer of...ever. Before ordering the belt, I emailed them with a question regarding sizing. It seems as if I am in a bit of a middle ground of waist size. I wear a consistent size 32\" across the board. Based on this, I was recommended a small-sized belt, but once I received my belt and tried it on, it was just an inch or two too small for me. Again, I messaged them and once again received a nearly immediate response. They immediately sent me a medium-sized belt before I even began the process of sending back the small-sized belt. I was offered a full refund on shipping. I received the new medium sized belt in a few days and it fit perfectly. As an added bonus, they sent me a newer model black belt. It was very similar, but with a few minor upgrades. From what I could immediately tell, the ratcheting is much smoother. Mission Belt and I exchanged a few more emails to ensure that I was pleased with my purchase.Prior to ordering this belt, I had ordered three of the Erik Blaire brand ratchet belts in different colors. While this company also has great customer service from my experience and similar buckles, the belt strap is really what sets these belts apart. Mission Belts are dyed leather, as opposed to the Erik Blaire belts which are painted on patterns. This painting resulted in my belts \"cracking\" over just a couple of months. The Mission Belts look like leather, feel like leather...and yes even smell like leather. Some models are even labeled \"yeah...its leather.\" I cannot say the same for their competitor. I do not want to trash the Erik Blaire Belts, because I initially did fall in love with them and their customer service was also very good from my experience, but they are simply not as nice as these. I recommend these for yourself or as a gift. I absolutely guarantee that NO ONE would be disappointed with one of these belts. Oh and one final thing, they even donate a portion of every belt sale to charity to feed the hungry. Great belt, great companyThese belts are awesome. Just order one now.",

                "reviewText": "Like many other reviewers have mentioned, this product was featured on Shark Tank, which is how I heard about the company. I thought it sounded like a genius idea; I hate traditional belt loops, because I always feel like I would be more comfortable between one or the other, and on some belts, the holes do begin to stretch out some over time. I've been burned by Shark Tank products before though (looked great on the show, ordered them, and they don't perform nearly as well as advertised).This has not been the case with this Mission belt. By far, this is the best belt I have ever owned or used. I chose the \"Vader\", the black belt with the black and chrome buckle. It arrived quickly from Amazon, and ships in a small box. The packaging is simple but adequate. I love that they include a small set of \"instructions\", both for how to operate the belt and also how to trim the belt shorter if you ever want to cut the excess down. Also, inside the box is a truly handwritten note from someone at Mission, thanking me for the order; a very nice touch. I also had no idea that the company donated $1 from each belt purchased to charity, which is a huge plus, and I guess the reason for the name \"Mission\".The packaging is nice, but you'll forget all about it once you see the belt. My first and instant reaction was that I couldn't believe how gorgeous the buckle looked and felt. It is a very solid, weighty piece of metal. It feels like you could run the buckle over with a tank and it wouldn't take a scratch, it is SOLID feeling. The leather is also of a higher quality than I expected. It's thick and feels great, and the stitching around the edges looks nice as well.As for the ratcheting mechanism of the belt, some other reviews complained about problems with it, but so far mine has been flawless. It is fun to hear that ratcheting sound every morning when I put the belt on, and even nicer to be able to get it to the exact length I want on that particular day. The release mechanism is designed very well; in a way where it is highly unlikely you'd ever activate it by accident, but it's very easy to activate intentionally with the flip of a single finger (and without needing to see it). It's hidden away on the side of the belt that faces down to the floor, which is nice because it keeps the part of the buckle you or anyone else will see looking smooth and sleek.Love this belt, and I now need to buy it in more colors and with more buckles so I can replace all of my other belts as well. I've paid more money for belts before in the past that haven't been half as nice as this in looks and certainly no where close in design. Unquestionably a five star product for me.",

I would avoid the 35mm wide leather belts (thinner model) as mine have all cracked within 2-3 years. I've had better luck with the 40mm nylon belts and they actual look nice enough for business-casual settings. They seem to be more durable.If Mission could upgrade the leather belt models, they would be the best belt on the market, by far. I still love 'em and still buy 'em... but I avoid the 35mm now. One star off until they sort that cracking leather issue! ;-)",

Der Schaden ist nicht gro\u00df, ich bin mir sicher, dass man da einfach zwei Nieten reinkloppen kann und das Teil ist wieder wie neu. Da ich auf die Schnelle jedoch kein passendes Werkzeug auftreiben konnte, habe ich die Website von Mission Belt aufgerufen. Dort habe ich dem Support die Situation per Chat geschildert und freundlich gefragt, was ich jetzt machen soll. Aufpassen, True Story!Binnen Sekunden kam eine Antwort!Sie baten mich um einen Screenshot der Amazon Bestellung. Diesen habe ich dann per E-Mail verschickt und umgehend dir Info erhalten, dass mir eine neue G\u00fcrtelschnalle zugeschickt wird!KOSTENFREI nat\u00fcrlich!!! Aus AMERIKA!!! WTF!!! \ud83d\udc4dMission Belt ist der beste G\u00fcrtel den ich je hatte und ich will auch keinen anderen mehr haben!Nach der geschilderten Erfahrung die ich mit dem Support von Mission Belt gemacht habe, w\u00fcrde ich heute wahrscheinlich sogar die \u00fcberteuerten 95\u20ac daf\u00fcr bezahlen!",

I was a bit apprehensive as the colour on screen looked to be quite a rich hue of burgundy, moving towards purple, but in reality the colour is not as on screen, it is darker and is a perfect match to the shoes, so I'm really happy. I contacted the seller once I'd ordered since the delivery time (coming from USA) was approx. a month, and I needed the belt for an event, asking if it could be expedited. They replied immediately and said they'd see what they could do. I ordered on 13/04/18 and the belt arrived today, 25/04/18 well ahead of the delivery estimate. Really happy with the service and the quality of the items.",
