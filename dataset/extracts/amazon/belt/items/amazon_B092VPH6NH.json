The \"zip tie\" nature of this belt eliminates that. You can also easily adjust the belt just by pulling it tighter (it clicks with each 0.2 inch adjustment) or lifting the buckle slightly to make it looser. It came with plenty of extra material and it's marked for easy cutting to the exact right size for the owner. I've not owned it very long, so I will try to remember to come back and edit this review next year after its had time to show how it ages. But for now, I have no interest in going back to old-school holed belts.",

I\u2019d found that my belts, no matter how well made, weren\u2019t lasting as long as they should have due to the stress of the metal prong pulling against and gradually enlarging or tearing the holes in the belt when it is worn tightly. Simply not an issue due to this design. By reducing the daily wear and tear on the belt, it looks much better and will surely last much longer, providing value for money. I bought a black and a brown one. I ordered them in the recommended size for my waistline, and they fit perfectly without any alteration necessary. My hope is that each one will last at least twice as long as the ones I had bought off the rack at retail stores before showing signs of wear. They were also a bit cheaper than the ones I had bought at men\u2019s stores, some of which cost as much as $30 for a comparable product which wears out quicker.",
