Easy to remove, easy to adjust and looks sleek. It would perfect for making into a work belt with a little creativity. A person could make/attach various pouches, hooks, d-rings to the belt and make a custom work belt. I am tempted to do this for my work in freight to hold extra box cutters, blades, packing tape, band-aids, etc.",

But .. the belt has a 2 part buckle, which is ok, however the belt webbing itself has a removable loop which needs to be removed while putting the belt on the pants, then the removable loop goes on, or the loop will not fit through the pant loops\u2026Then you need to separate the two part buckle, feed the belt webbing through the buckle, connect the buckle ends, and if it fits great, But.. if it doesn\u2019t fit, unbuckle the buckle, adjust the webbing, and reattach the buckle. oy!Lets just say if a regular belt takes 10-15 seconds to put on this one takes 30 secondsHowever, once you get used to it, it\u2019s actually a very good feeling belt.

The belt was stiffer and much sturdier then I realized. It held very well, despite having a little give. It is a little annoying taking it on and off, meaning you can't just slide it off like you could most belts. But if you don't mind that little caveat, then it's a very good belt, for me.",

                "reviewText": "My main reason for the 3 stars is that this belt is decent for normal wear but not for guns due to its stretchy nature. I understand having SOME stretch, but I could keep adjusting it all day and still have too much stretch to be too stretched to feel comfortable. The belt buckle is too big and bulky, which will cause discomfort if you don't have a flat stomach.At this price, rather than buying this, I would recommend just saving up a bit more and buying a KORE belt.",

                "reviewText": "It's a great buckle for tightening or loosening on the fly without being locked into specific holes on a traditional belt. VERY good if camping or hunting and you happen to have gear/tool bags hanging from the belt and you have to tighten as you hike or work. The strap fabric also has a bit of give, so you're not pinched if you've tightened it while hiking and then go to sit down. This feels like essential outdoor gear to have, would definitely recommend.I bought this belt for my size waist and could easily cut a good 5\" or 6\" inches off the end, which I think I will do.As for the buckle not fitting through your belt loops, you have to be smarter than the belt. No other way to say it. Instructions are pretty clear -- run the belt strap itself through your pant loops with the buckle snapped shut on one end, like any standard belt. Insert the open strap end into the buckle and tighten it. From then on you can open and close the belt buckle with an easy touch of it's button. No need to take the strap out of the buckle until you put the belt into another pair of pants. It is no harder than a standard belt.",

Buckle is strong and easy to use, no accidentally openings. It won't replace my other leather belts, but being infinitly adjustable is nice.As others (and the manufacturer) have said, the buckle is just a bit too big to pass though belt loops (even on jeans) so if you want to remove the belt to switch pants you have to unloop one end first. It's not a huge issue but be aware.Also because the nylon has some stretch for comfort I'd be a bit concerned about sag if you have something heavy on your belt. There are some other belts that use a non-stretchy material and I'd recommend those if you're clipping or holstering heavy tools to your belt.",

You do need to watch that the little elastic loop is not lost when you are taking the belt off and on (airport security). Very pleased with this belt.",
