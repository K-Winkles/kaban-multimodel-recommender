But, for now...I searched for hours for the most relatively, inexpensive belt, and eventually landed upon this one. Giving it a try, the pictures seemed good. The comments were nice, however within a few short months I noticed the \"leather\" begin to tear or fray at the seams... that was the first sign of dismay. For example, previous true genuine leather belts never cracked and in fact, lasted for years! Then, the belt loop had come undone.Just this afternoon, while using the restroom and then adjusting my belt as I normally would, I heard a metal ting sound... Unaware of the origin, it was the build of the frame: or Buckle? not sure what to call it but the belt itself, had completely broken apart and was deemed useless. Having to only toss it into the trash. I was quite embarrassed picking up the metal pieces around me.Now, I'm back to square one searching for a new belt. I would give it 2 stars however, it was impossible to use after that. Again, I'm sure this is a great company but a waste of my money.",
