                "reviewText": "The first shipment had me nonplussed. Couldn't make the belt come back through the loop. After looking more closely at the Amazon picture, it appeared that the buckle had a swivel at the bottom. What I received didn't have that feature. In fact, I discovered that it was broken exactly there. Returned that mystery belt and received a new one that had the swivel intact. Now all is well, and I like the feel and craftsmanship of the belt. Very helpful to have two colors for daily and work wear.",

                "reviewText": "I got the Signature Webbing belt to replace a webbing belt I got from Fox over 10 years ago. And... I went back to the fox belt within two weeks of wearing this. The webbing/belt is fine, but the buckle is garbage. It held great for a week, then after that it started slipping. By the end of two weeks (Which is now), I can't even get out of a truck without feeling it pop and slip several times, and my pants start trying to fall down. I don't keep that much weight on my belt either, just a small set of keys and a leatherman. I've also had to deal with the buckle randomly popping off the fixed end of the belt twice now. Easy enough to reinstall it, but still annoying. I really expected better from Carhartt. Way better. I like the webbing still, so I guess I'll be trying to find a new buckle.",
