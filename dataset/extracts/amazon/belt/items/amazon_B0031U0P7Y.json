Fit pretty much as expected based on the sizing information provided.Update 13 months later: The belt has been worn almost every day for the last 13 months. I pretty much live in jeans these days. My waist size has decreased by 3 inches, and I'll have to replace it soon, not because it has worn out, but because it is now too large. I'll be buying the same belt in a smaller size, and keeping the old one just in case I inadvertently find the weight I have lost.",

Now I wish I hadn't bought a new dress belt because this one would be good looking enough for dress casual (Dockers, etc). It's full thickness leather without blemishes and it will last forever since it is not a laminate of thinner leather held together with stitching. May well be the last belt I ever buy.",

I wear a size 36 to 37, and it fits perfectlty. I also have the black one. No issues with either. I'm about 6' 1\" if it matters. If you like a good support around your waist, this product is a good solution.",

Not that I am on \"fashion parade\" when in the woods, but it's sharp-looking enough to wear to work at my Silicon Valley company. The inside surface of the belt came too slick to serve as a strop, but having sanded off the top coating (whatever it is) and simultaneously roughed up the leather, I applied Bark River black compound, and I do believe I have given the belt a second purpose in life. With my best (BRKT, Fallkniven) knives sporting convex edges, I thought it would be especially appropriate to carry a strop. Now, as long as I remember not to drop my drawers, I'll not have to remember to carry a separate strop!",
