It can fit me but I have to use some of the last holes which leaves a large flap. However, if you need a belt in this size or you grab the correct size this belt will be great. Reverses easily. The buckle + tongue slot in the belt holes without issue. Obviously neutral belt colors. The buckle itself is a little big and bright silver which is fine if you don't mind it being a little flashy. However the design itself is not flashy, so no worry there.",

                "reviewText": "This is a men's reversible belt in the Amazon Essentials brand. It's a reversible belt. Mine came in size 50\" after seeing the advice that you should order two sizes above your usual size.This is noted as being a classic jean belt and is crafted with a blend of 50% PU, 50% GRS bonded Leather. This premium blend of materials provides a leather like look and texture so you can look your best.It's definitely important to note that this is not a \"leather\" belt. It's a belt made to have a leather look to it. The comparison I can think of is that bonded wood is actually particle board - it can look like wood but it's not. The same is true here. Bonded leather is not leather - it can look like leather but made quite differently.That said, this is still a decent and affordable belt. It's comfortable and has pretty good flexibility to it. The buckle works well, though it definitely has a little give to it.As pictured, this is a reversible belt. I definitely like that. It's also a belt that can be easily cleaned with just wetting and wiping.I've been generally happy with my products in the Amazon line and I expect that to be true here. While this is not a premium belt, it's a quality decent belt that looks attractive and wears comfortably. I would definitely purchase this belt again.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered a size 44 men's reversable belt because I was thinking I wanted to be able to take both a brown and a black belt when traveling without wasting space on two belts.This fits as expected, and is easily reversed by flipping the head of the belt around. It looks and feels well made, and seems like a belt that will last for a very long time.One thing to note is that the product image shows a black and a brown belt, but this is just one belt. That's probably obvious, but at the time I posted this review the listing didn't say if it was one or two belts - but the picture of the brown and black belts together is just so you can compare the different colors.Overall, at roughly $25 for a reversable belt, this is a good value, and less than I've paid for similar products in the past. Definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Over the years, Amazon Essentials products I've purchased have been more misses than hits. That said, this appears to be similar to a budget belt you might find at Walmart or another discount chain for around the same price.Plastic belts are no substitute for good quality full-grain leather belts. They either fall apart (often where the plastic attaches to the buckle) or the coating scrapes off, or both. You're getting what you're paying for.According to the label: the polyester base (used for strength and shape) is coated with polyurethane to look like leather. There is no mention of leather. Made in Cambodia. I don't know where Amazon gets \"50% PU, 50% GRS bonded Leather.\" The brown side does smell slightly of leather; however, that means only 20% of that brown coating would have leather (from scraps) infused into it. The black side smells of plastic.3 stars due to the confusing description and photo (as other reviewers have mentioned).My rating system:5 Stars = Knocks it out of the park. A great value!4 Stars = Excellent product. A solid buy.3 Stars = It provides some value, but perhaps not as advertised.2 Stars = A little dubious, so do your research. Read the critical reviews!1 Star = Avoid this product and look elsewhere.",

I got size 44 which is 4 inches larger than my typical jean size and it fits perfectly. Never knew that you were supposed to size up at least 2 sizes when buying a belt. It is a reversable belt and the face can be made to be brown or black and the buckle is easy to swivel.",

                "reviewText": "The belts I wear on a daily basis are full-grain leather that work with a pair of khakis or jeans. I needed something that was a little dressier to wear with a suit, and this fits that. However, the material is one that will crack and wear if you try to wear it on a regular basis.But I knew that going in, and it works well for the once or twice a month I need to wear a suit then let it sit and hang straight for the other 28 days a month.It's an Amazon Basics belt, not a big fashion house or something, but the Amazon Basics brand is generally comparable to the mass-merchandiser things that I have (the slacks compare favorable to Dockers, for instance), and I suspect that a Guess belt and this belt are similar for the PU Leather, which is really just a marketing term about leather, rather than anything that came from a cow.",
