I know not everyone is a fan of a ratchet belt, but I am, and these are great. They are well packed, nicely boxed. I had a problem with with the black belt of the set, it would constantly slip looser. I contacted the company through amazon to ask and was immediately offered a replacement belt. It too was boxed and packed well, and I haven't trimmed it to size yet, but have tested the buckle on the rachet portion of the belt and could not force it to slip, so I have confidence.Thanks Chaoren for being a company that backs up its products!",

Very easy to create the correct length. The permanent lock is very well done. The ratchet adjustment is really well thought out and adjustment is very fine. Much better than just a few holes. The belt overall forms to my waist nicely. Not too stiff and not too soft. If there has to be one complain I would pick the weight of the buckle. It is a bit heavy but not a deal breaker. Highly recommended.",
