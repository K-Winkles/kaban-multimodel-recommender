The ratchet system ensures you won\u2018t have your leather split from hundreds of donning and doffing of the belt and the bending of the strap that comes with a conventional belt with holes. No holes that are too tight or just loose. Being able to adjust these belts in very small increments makes all the difference in the world.",

We recommend that you can buy a larger size, and as our waistbands can be trimmed, you can always cut off more. How long is the tail of the belt?

The packaging was nice and the belt is perfect for office wear or, depending on your suit and color options, even a bit nicer. Super easy to use, no more unsightly stretching of holes if you go up/down in weight, clicks into place and stays there.Release is a quick little lever-like thing on the buckle so it actually comes undone quicker than your traditional buckle. The only thing I'm not crazy about is its a bit stiff and retains the round shape. I tend to prefer ones that will lay flat if I put them on a hangar so its not coiling and poking if its in a suit bag. solution there was to just coil tightly and pack off the hangar (stuffed it in my shoe coiled up.)",
