                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. It's not easy to find a single piece of genuine leather when it comes to belts, but this is a hidden gem! I got this for my father because his old leather belt was stretched out and worn to shreds with the buckle falling off. While he has a 36\" waist, note that the sizing chart advises to go up a size (so I grabbed a 38\"). The belt fits him perfectly and the end tucks just right into the buckle and loop as it circles around the waist of his jeans. I was hesitant to order online but I'm so glad I did. Wrangler is a brand that we both like and trust, and he is thrilled with the new belt.It arrived coiled up in a small bag and had the authentic Wrangler tags attached. The inside has the \"genuine leather\" stamp. While a little stiff to start, he's been wearing it for a few weeks now and it's already softened and curved in all the right places. He wears it daily and couldn't be more pleased with his gift. Highly recommend!Made in India.",
