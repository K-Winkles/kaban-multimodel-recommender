No holes that are too tight or just loose. Being able to adjust these belts in very small increments makes all the difference in the world.",

I actually bought more after the first 2 because for the price they are already way better than belts I've bought for the similar price. The ratchet is great, comfortable and easy to use. A much better fit than trying to find the right hole. Also great if your waste line fluctuates, so no stretched out holes when you are in between. Pretty good style too. Only question is durability but time will tell. So far so good. (Got my first 2 belts about 3 months ago and now real signs of wear)",
