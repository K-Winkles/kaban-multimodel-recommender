Who believed fashion was FUN, and should never be taken too seriously. Patterns, pops of color, new shapes and never-before-seen styles \u2014 he embraced it all, rewriting the rules and redefining American sportswear. Perry\u2019s focus was on innovation; breaking down the walls of fashion and making clothes designed with REAL LIFE in mind. Not just \u2018fashion, for fashion\u2019s sake,\u2019 but clothes that simplify style choices. The Perry Ellis ethos hasn\u2019t changed. Since that first unapologetic American collection in 1976, Perry Ellis clothes continue to enhance our guy\u2019s life across work, play and family - giving him the CONFIDENCE to go anywhere and do anything. Today Perry Ellis is a global lifestyle brand that continues to design clothes, fragrance, watches, footwear and more, with real life in mind.",

The buckle end is spring-loaded, so all you do is pull it out a fraction of an inch, rotate it 180 degrees, and let it snap back. No removing and reversing the buckle or anything like that. Why they didn't think of this 50 years ago, I'll never know. Looks good, too!",

Despite only light use, the buckle became detached from the leather after just over a year of use. Perry Ellis used to be my belt brand of choice, but their belts have declined in quality. The leather quality feels more like plastic, and wears out quicker to the point that the buckle rivets will eventually tear the material.
