The belt seems well made, it's nice looking, it holds his pants up. Does what belts are supposed to do. His one observation, not really a complaint, is that the belt buckle is \"jingly\"...not annoyingly so or anything but sometimes you do hear it.Bought this to replace the Levi's casual belt I purchased less than a month ago - buckle came off of that one. This seems to be put together better.",

                "reviewText": "My wife bought one of these for me and it lasted over a year before the pin that holds the buckle to the rest of the belt pulled free. I was able to force it back in to limp along for about another month but couldn't actually tighten the belt without the buckle pulling out. Broke down and bought a second one that failed after 5 months. Bought a third because I'm a moron and it made it about 8 months before I noticed the buckle starting to separate again. There is an inherent problem in the design, the belt buckle and belt are connected by an oversized ridged pin force compressed into a smaller hole. With the constant tension pulling on the buckle pin, it's inevitable that this will fail and forcing it back together does nothing as the ridged pin has already been compressed and will never have a tight bite again. Great idea, just poor implementation. Needs the connection point redesigned then it would be an excellent belt. Another reviewer posted a photo of the pin after their buckle pulled free.",

The buckle was very bulky and kinda sat away from my waist even when tight. No issues with the mechanics of the spinning buckle and changing sides, it\u2019s a cool feature. Just not a comfortable belt. Which I never really thought would be important with a belt. Turns out it is.",
