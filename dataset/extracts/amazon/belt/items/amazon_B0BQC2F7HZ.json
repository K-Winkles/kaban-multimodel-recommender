The navy blue belt works well with blue jeans and the black belt works well for events and with office attire. I always used to wear navy belts but now I will never go back. These belts are easily adjusted to fit perfectly and unlike other belts that cut into your gut, these are very comfortable in every situation.High quality materials: I have been wearing these for almost a half of a year and I still have not seen any signs of damage. They are made so amazing well that I almost can't believe that they are sold for such a reasonable price! I highly recommend these for yourself or as a great gift.",

The belts are beautiful, well made and I love them - but we cannot use them. Unfortunately we are outside the window (because I buy early and we had Christmas late.) If there is any chance we could exchange them for a smaller size, that would be awesome, but I can't find any way to contact the company other than a review.",
