Being 1.5 inches wide (instead of the typical one inch) it fits my belt loops better on my jeans so the top of the jeans doesn't fold over and bunch up around the waist. The buckle is a good size--sturdy but not obnoxiously big--for a large man like me (330 pounds). Just got it yesterday, so I can't speak to how well it will hold up, but it seems to be very well made and sturdy.",
