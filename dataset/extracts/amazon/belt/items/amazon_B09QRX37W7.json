                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Hey there!I totally splurged to get this belt.I love the HIGH quality of the leather. I've never had any Italian leather goods, but I'm sold on this belt.You know how that belts are usually very flexible and must to be pulled through the belt loops and around you? Well this \u215b\" this leather belt STAYS CURLED and IT wraps ITSELF around you! I've never seen or heard the likes of that. It's amazing! And it fits so well too. And the belt buckle itself is curved to fit your waist, which helps with it not poking into my belly (I have a \"Dad-bod\" lol!).Oh! The belt also comes with a \"leather punch\" (a striking tool) that you can place over the belt and punch into it (by hitting the non sharp end with a hammer) to make a new custom placed hole if you want or need the belt to fit to a certain size. I was so surprised to find that in the box that it came in.Overall... This is THE MOST PHENOMENAL belt that I've EVER had. It made me wonder what it's like to be wealthy and to have these things available to you for your entire lifetime. Must be nice! I've never spent this much on a belt, but it's so worth it.I also used my Prime Chase credit card rewards points and brought the price down to next to nill. Buying Christmas presents paid off immensely. I was very surprised to find that I had gotten enough back to buy this and most of another nice item.Buy the belt if you can afford it, it's WELL WORTH the money and it'll last a lifetime of it's taken care of, I'm sure.Oh, and the colors that you have available to you to choose from are varied and gorgeous!I hope that this review has helped you with considering your possible purchase. God bless! \u261d\ufe0f\ud83d\ude01",

                "reviewText": "This is one of the few products that I've purchased over the last decade in which the business obviously pays attention to detail and takes pride in the product that they make.Attention to details:1) two loops so that the end of the belt doesn't flap;2) an included tool for customizing the length of the belt (not needed in my case but unbelievable that it's even included);3) and last but not least this inexpensive belt was shipped in a full length sleeve to protect the leather from being scuffed.I like the simplicity of the design - no fancy stitching; it's all about the quality of the leather.I purchased the Cognac color which looks GREAT with a pair of black jeans.The bottom line is that is a high quality belt at a very fair price. Why the average review of this belt is only 4.4 is beyond my ability to understand.",

What I do dislike is the massive buckle. Its a huge chunk of metal and the pictures don't really convey how thick this buckle is. The buckle also curves to try and follow the contour of your body but again its so big that you would have to be a large(wide and tall) individual for it to actually fit properly. Wearing it felt okay but sitting down for long periods is a serious problem.",
