They look very classy, and are true to the pictures. I've compared them to belts I've seen in the stores that range from $30 to $60, and I honestly think they are comparable.However, these do not match the overall quality. You cannot expect them to, I paid less than $30 for 3 belts. I was not expecting the quality to meet that of a belt costing 3 to 6x the amount.If you are looking for a belt that looks like it cost much more than it did, these are a great option. If you are looking for a belt that matches the quality of a more expensive belt, these are not them.In all fairness, I was using a shiny, thin, back plastic belt for years and it held up just fine. I expect to get a few years or more out of these, if not longer. Overall, these are a really great budget set to expand your wardrobe a bit.",
