                "reviewText": "Okay Vegan leather, I am just not used to it. If feels off and my husband was concerned about no holes even though I explained it to him. Also I bought it too big was concerned it was not going to work at all. He was going out and said, look I put my new belt on. It looked nice on him and he said it was easy to buckle. The extra length even worked out well as he ran it through a belt loop and it stayed in place.In conclusion, my husband seems to like it and really needed a belt although I wish I had of gotten a smaller size, but that is on me. I also wish it was black, but even so, the coloring looked nice with his black pants. The belt looks better on than in your hands, again, used to leather and not Vegan leather, but at the end of the day this belt did its job. How durubable it is is remains to be seen as I am not used to Vegan leather products so it is a bit of a experiment for us.",

                "reviewText": "As a female, I don't really use belts for traditional uses, but more as an accessory, and it's a lot more affordable to buy men's options. I usually wear belts to accentuate my waist, and higher up than you'd normally wear them. This one is great in that there are no pre-drilled holes, and you can easily wear it as big or small as you need, so I can change it up depending on what I'm wearing. A lot of female belts aren't very sturdy and more expensive than men's belts. This is case in point. It's great quality for the price point. If you're wearing it higher than low on the waist, just think about possibly sizing down, so it's not too big when you wear it higher.",

                "reviewText": "Build qualityThe first thing that struck me is the belt is very lightweight. The woven pieces are fairly thin which I guess they need to be in order to weave them but I didn't realize it would lighten the weight of the whole belt that much. The leather is a bit stiff but that's fine for a belt. The outside of the belt has a smooth finsihed leather, while the inside is unfinished and a bit rough (which is good because it keeps a belt from staining clothes or sliding in loops). In short I am pleased with the quality and constructionUseThis pairs with blue jeans perfectly for a slightly upscale casual look or goes with khakis quite well. the belt is comfortable and easy to put on and take off. The belt does allow a slight stretch and is comfortable when sitting with no adjustment.SturdinessThis is sturdy and strong enough for most use but if you really stress a belt the thinner leather could be more apt to break.Final thoughtsThis is a great belt that I recommend. It fits well and looks great.",

                "reviewText": "Amazon Essentials Men's Fully Adjustable Braided BeltI like the fact that this is fully adjustable, and you do not have to rely on prepositioned holes and hope for the right fit. Bovine Leather is what the tag says the material is, but the description says a leather like look, so I am not really sure what material is used but it is on the pliable side and does feel and look like leather to me. What I do not like about it is the width, it is tight going through my belt loops but because of the head of the belt being a bit wider than the belt itself it is a bit hard to get back out of the loops. I wish it was a bit less wide. Also, it says order 2 inches more than your pants size. I wear a size 34 and I ordered a 38 belt because there were no size 36 available and I am glad I did because size 38 was just right, so I would recommend 4 inches above your pants size. All in all, this is a nice belt that looks and feels good.4 stars",

                "reviewText": "My husband burns through belts regularly, so I am always on a quest for a durable, easy to clean belt. In his line of work, he gets grimy due to the materials he works with. This belt wipes clean, so I appreciate how easy it is to clean.The fit was spot on. Sizing is accurate and the buckle part seems durable.It's pleather (vegan) rather than leather, which is not something we actively look for, but I appreciate good quality materials when I do find them. This is great, but the price at $19 is just a few dollars less than what I just paid for a Michael Kors leather belt at TJ Maxx for the holidays, so I can't say this was a bargain at all. It's of average value for a decent belt.",
