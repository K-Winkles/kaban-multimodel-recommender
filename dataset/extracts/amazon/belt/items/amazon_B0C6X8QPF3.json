The width of the belt is exactly 1-3/8 in. except for the buckle. I will keep an eye on how it endures travelling. It is worth the cost I paid.",

There's a little elastic loop the tail can go through to keep it from dangling loosely. The previous nylon belt I had lasted me for more than 25 years, although it had a traditional buckle, so eventually it wore out at the holes for the buckle, but nylon straps hold up far better than leather straps, so I'm hoping that this one will outlast me, especially since there are no holes to wear out. The nylon is of a very tight weave. The buckle has a clamping system, which grabs the full width of the belt",

                "reviewText": "Overall it\u2019s a nice belt , but has one flaw. Where the base end of the belt goes into the buckle, there are metal teeth that are supposed to grip onto the belt and hold it. In my opinion, either the teeth are too small, or the belt is too thin and the belt tends to slip out of the holder. This has happened to me three times this week, and one time it was embarrassing. \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab",
