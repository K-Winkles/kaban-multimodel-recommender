Looks great in business environment and wears well. The fabric stands up to a lot of abuse and will last a long time. Friction buckle is great design will not come undone.Trim to length and you are set. (Cut fabric with sharp scissors, melt the cut side with a lighter to avoid fraying over time and then dip end in water to make sure there is no ongoing fire risk.)",

I prefer the sliding range of size adjustments over the wider-spaced buckle holes found in leather belts.The look, feel, and weight of this belt seem more robust and durable than ones I have been wearing... time will tell. It feels just as comfortable, with as much flex and give as the webbing I have been accustomed to, and that's important in my everyday activities and outdoor pursuits. What first attracted me was the black buckle and tip. I never liked that brass- colored shine and glint on other brands. I would much prefer hardware more muted for casual wear, and I've felt obliged to hide the reflections under camouflage tape when afield for hunting.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these belts, each a different color. The belt is listed as 56\", but there was about a 4-inch difference in the length of the two belts.Second issue: On one belt, the metal 'cap' on the end of the belt is wider than the woven belt itself. When removing the belt, the cap always snags on the belt loops. This has resulted in the cap being a little loose on the end of the belt. The metal is also pretty soft, so it seems to deform a bit when this happens as well. There's also potential to damage belt loops.It's a pretty cheap belt, and you get what you pay for, but I've had similar belts from other mfg. that didn't have these problems.",
