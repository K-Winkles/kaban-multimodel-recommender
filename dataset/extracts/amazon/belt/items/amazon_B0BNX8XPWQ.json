                "reviewText": "Prominent leather tanning smell. Too smelly to put in my dresser drawer so hung it on door knob but the smell quickly filled the room. Hung it outside on Nov 3rd. Today is 11/28 - nearly 4 weeks later - several rains - hot sunny days - freezes. I can still smell it when I walk near it. Outside on my deck!On the positive side, the smell has reduced maybe 75%. I have to be within 5ish feet to smell it now. However, wearing it would still put me in a cloud of industrial chemicals that would quickly fill a room. I'm guessing another month may age out most of the smell but I don't know if that will be enough to make it usable. Maybe 2 more months...The smell is leathery but should not be confused with a 14 yo boy's first cologne. First, nobody, not even a teenager, would mistake the belt smell for too much cologne. It does NOT smell like teen spirit. Second, a teenager who dips himself into a cologne vat would lose his aroma in a couple of days. This belt has real staying power.Obviously, there was some incompetence at the leather tanning stage and again at the belt making stage and again at the packaging stage. They all failed quality assurance. That many incompetencies point directly at production management. In addition, marketing management has been aware of previous reviews that mentioned the smell and didn't care. This stuff is still for sale.My advice to you is to put Vitan on your \"do not buy from them\" list and watch for them to resurface in Amazon under a new name.Unusable product. Unscrupulous company.",
