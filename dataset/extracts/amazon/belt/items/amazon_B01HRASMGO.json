Since my waist size is at the upper range for a medium belt, I ordered a large one, which ended up being a mistake. After receiving it and trying it on, it was considerably too long, so I've replaced it with a medium belt, which works just fine. This is a nice belt which I hope will give me several years of good service. I would recommend this belt to other customers but be aware that it stretches when you're determining what length to order.",
