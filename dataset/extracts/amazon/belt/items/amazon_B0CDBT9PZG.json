                "reviewText": "This is only my second ratchet belt. The first one I got relatively recently and I was worried (as a bit of a fat guy) that it wouldn't hold up. But that first one did, so I thought I would find a black one to compliment the brown one I already had, and this black carbon fiber belt looked like a good choice.So far I am very pleased. This belt and buckle look great, fit well, get the job done, and I really am growing to love the style of these ratchet belts without holes. They just have a different \"clean\" look that I typically cannot get with traditional belts, because I tend to get too much pressure from the buckle on the hole and leave wear marks on the belt. This style so far has not shown that type of wear, since the connecting interface is on the back of the belt only. Very cool.I'm very tempted to pick up another one of these in a different color, just for wardrobe variety. 5 stars, would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "This belt is perfect for my teenage son that is in between sizes. Typical belts can be either too tight or too loose but the ratchet style closure on this belt makes it easy to find the perfect fit. The sleek black look transitions easily from jeans and a hoodie to suit and tie making this a great one and done belt. It's a bit stiff, but I'm hoping with wear it will relax. I'm overall very pleased with this belt.",
