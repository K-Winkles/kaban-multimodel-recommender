I unhooked the uncut side (there's a little clasp) and just reversed the belt and put the cut side in so I didn't have to whip any frayed end.Belt holds well & has a little give to it, but not too much. There's a little metal clasp that you push to loosen it, which works well once you get used to it.I normally don't 'show' the belt I'm wearing since I have untucked shirts, so I can't comment much on the look of it. It's would go fine with jeans. The brown is pretty dark brown.",

Being able to customize the fit for yourself is a really nice feature too. I bought one for work and scratched it up pretty good. After a week, I wanted one to wear with nice clothes away from work, so I bought another one. Buy this belt and you will not be dissapointed.",
