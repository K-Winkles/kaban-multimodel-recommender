I gave him my replacement belt to get him back on the trails. He gave me the money to cover the replacement cost of this belt. These belts fit the Rzr perfectly. They are heavy duty. Don't waste your money buying belts from the dealer for 150.00 a pop. That's just crazy...the manufacturers don't make these things. They contract it out to places like Gates, then mark the price up x3.I carry a spare belt in every Rzr I own. Simply because these things break over time with use and abuse. And when they do break you are dead in the water. Don't get caught on the trails w/o a replacement. These are super cheap and do a great job.",
