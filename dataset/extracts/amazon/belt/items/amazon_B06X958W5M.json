I\u2019m exchanging for a size smaller. Would go down 2 sizes, but 47\u2019 is the smallest.Otherwise, seems high quality. Belt itself is a military grade type nylon. Very thick and rugged. Plastic buckle seems solid.",

The belt and buckle stay attached, which is an improvement over my old one, where I would have to reconnect it all the time. I am not crazy about the brand name printed on the front though. While it did arrive ahead of the scheduled due date, took too long in my opinion, but came from China, I believe. It is not going to win any fashion awards, but for yard work, house repairs, general day to day, it is up to the task.",
