                "reviewText": "I'm not really a fan of \"one size fits all\" belts/hats/anything or belts that can be folded to customize the fit. I also did not want to spend $30+ on a \"recreation\" belt that would be exposed to weather and outdoor elements while hiking, backpacking, camping or trail restoration work. After researching other options, I decided to go with this product and try it out and it turns out that this belt is great! It's comfortable, snugly adjustable, lightweight and not bulky, even after having to cinch it through the buckle for an overlap fold-back of 5-6 inches (depending on the style cut of pants being worn). The slide release buckle is very secure and requires an adequate amount of pressure on both tabs to release it. Also, the buckle's low profile design contributes to its comfort and \"flattering\" appearance. Definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "As a skier, my husband recently tried out an elastic belt designed for outdoor activities, and it has become an essential part of his ski gear.The elastic material of this belt provides a snug and secure fit, which is crucial for skiers who want to keep their pants or snowsuit in place while navigating the slopes. The belt is easily adjustable, accommodating various waist sizes and layering options for different weather conditions. The elastic material is sturdy and able to withstand the wear and tear of skiing, including exposure to cold temperatures and moisture. This belt offers a comfortable and unobtrusive wearing experience, ensuring it doesn't hinder your movements while skiing. Elastic belts may have a more utilitarian look, which might not be as fashion-forward as some skiers prefer.The elastic belt designed for skiers is a valuable addition to your skiing gear. It offers a secure fit, adjustability, and durability, ensuring that your ski pants stay in place during your adventures. While it may not be the most stylish accessory, its functionality and comfort make it a worthwhile investment for skiers looking for practical solutions to keep their gear secure and comfortable on the slopes.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a lightweight flexible belt I could wear while hiking, rock climbing, kayaking, etc... and found mention of this brand in an online forum.Let me just say this belt checks all of my boxes and then some. I'm able to adjust it to just the right tension so it holds securely but will flex when I sit/bend down or move. The plastic buckle lays flat when I sit or stand and doesn't poke me or create friction when wearing a pack with a hip belt. I personally don't mind the plastic buckle as I don't think it necessarily means lowered durability and is less clunky than metal. The belt is pretty easy to adjust and I was able to get it to my liking in under 5 min. Durability remains to be seen but for 30 dollars it's not a major investment.The major downside of this belt is it's sizing. I have a 32\" waist and only have about 3inches of slack left. I think if you have a larger waste the belt would need to be constantly flexed in order to accommodate you. Personally I think that would be uncomfortable. I like being able to have the belt just taught enough that it isn't \"stretching\" but can flex if need be during movement. This may just be a personal preference but I felt with pointing out.",
