                "reviewText": "I purchased this reversible belt as my other brown belt was shredding and falling apart. I was neatly surprised at the quality of this belt compared to what I already had. It seems well built and the belt remains in the buckle without losening. I bring this up as in the past when I have purchased a reversible belt, they tend to pull apart from the buckle as the tines do not keep it intact if there is any pressure on them. The buckle and belt would come part. This one has tines that secure the belt in the buckle very well. The color is also nice on both sides and it is easy to change sides.It has an option for you to cut the belt if needed to shorten it for your needs. I did not as I purchased based on my size. It is holding up well so far after 1 month of use.I highly recommend this to anyone as it is a quality belt and at a good price.",
