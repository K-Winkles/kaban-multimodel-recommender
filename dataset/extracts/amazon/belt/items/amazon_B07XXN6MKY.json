                "reviewText": "The release button for it jams every time on the one i ordered, and will tighten even more whenever i try to loosen it. Each time i needed another person to help me due to panic from the immense physical pain/pressure the belt was causing me while attempting to remove it, and even THEY couldnt figure out how to release it w/o taking it completely apart since the release button was defective. This is a HUGE design flaw as this belt came in a completely white box with no instructions or even the name of the company so i could look it up on youtube or google without opening amazon and having to lookup the specific order or protocol for something like this. Started out so well but this is very dangerous. I feel for those who experience this when they are running for the restroom.",
