This belt is infinitely adjustable (within size) and has enough elasticity to move with you. I\u2019ve had web belts in the past that you snug down then loosen through movement and you\u2019re left having to pick your pants up or readjusting the belt, so far this is the solution. The buckle is also well designed to not be uncomfortable for a larger guy. I\u2019m a fan",
