                "reviewText": "I am a woman with an almost straight lower body, my hips are only a few inches bigger than my waist. I have tried many cuts, styles, sizes, and brands of jeans/pants, but they always slide down as I walk or even just sit. These nice braided elastic belts, along with high waisted pants, are the only thing that have ever worked! They have normal buckles and look good with a tucked-in shirt, unlike many I viewed that have a cheap, flat metal or plastic buckle. They are generously sized: I ended up keeping them in two sizes down from the first size I ordered. I recommend measuring where you want the belt to fit (hips or waist) and ordering the size that it 2 or 3 inches bigger than that measurement, they stretch well. They seem good quality. All the belt buckles are silver-colored. They have a decent color selection, but I would like to see them add: different shades of brown and gray, and, especially, burgundy, which is a wardrobe staple for me and that I coouldn\u2019t find anywhere. I bought the belt in every solid color they offer because I like to wear colored jeans. I ordered pink and purple from another vendor. I think these would work great for men, too, they have a substantial width, at least 2 inches. My only complaint is that the size and color are not shown on the outside of the package (it\u2019s all in Chinese). All of the 20 or so that I ordered arrived about the same time, so to do my return, I had to open and measure every belt and put a Post-It with the size and color on them, so that I didn\u2019t return the wrong ones. Highly recommended; I now can walk around hands-free because I don\u2019t have to hold up my pants with one or both hands anymore!",
