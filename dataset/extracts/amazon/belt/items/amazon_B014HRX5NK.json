                "reviewText": "It's a belt? It appears to be a cotton-man-made blend. Very heavy cloth. Mostly single stitch around belt loops with a close zigzag stitch at the end of the material that would be subject to fray. It is also seared at that end of the buckle stitch to prevent fraying. It has a painted steel crimped end, and painted loops. The 46 - 50 inch belt, is 59.25 inches when laid out flat. My waist is 46 inches and the 46-50 belt closes with about 7 inches of spare when worn. It fits as expected. I believe that initial quality and initial durability are oxymorons, because quality and durability can only be tested by time. I find it insulting to be asked about those factors at the time of purchase, or any time, soon thereafter. However, this is a marketing tool used by Amazon so I will not deduct for misleading marketing.",
