The last few years I have had problems with the belt hardware falling apart or if I find a \"tuff\" belt it's so hard that it cuts into my side when bending, sitting then I found this Wonderful Temberland PRO Belt!This Timberland pro belt is the softest belt I have ever owned, soft but also heavy duty. This belt is soft enough to use for Church on Sunday then also use it to hang your electrical tool belt from on Monday morning! Thats exactly what I needed, a great belt for Jeans, shorts, casual pants but and allow me to work., play, move around and not pull apart and not cut into my side. This is the most comfortable belt I have owned. It so soft I had to make sure it was leather ( see my pic, its leather)If you are hard to please and need a well made belt thats extra soft, Buy this one! Perfect!",
