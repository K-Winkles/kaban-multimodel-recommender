                "reviewText": "I didn't really need three belts but for the price, WTH. These belts are sturdy and the buckles are great. They stay locked tight. Other nylon belts I've had in the past came with buckles that kept loosening. Not this belt. The buckle stays locked right where you close it. In fact, you have to kind of lift it outward when unbuckling to allow it to unlock. Not a big deal once you discover that. I am not crazy about the little elastic band that serves as the loop you pass the end through once you buckle it. It does hold the tail end of the belt just fine but when taking the belt off your pants, it will catch on the belt loop of your pants as you take the belt out. First couple of times, I fount the little elastic band on the floor. Now, I simply feed it through the pant belt loop as I begin to remove the belt so it doesn't do that. Not a big enough deal to deduct a star from my rating. The belt is also easy to adjust to a smaller waist size by cutting the end that locks into the buckle. Just know that with any nylon belt, you will have to melt the cut end with a match or lighter to prevent fraying. Just be careful with that and don't over heat it or catch it on fire. I even used one of these belts to strap a car battery onto the back of my bicycle when I had to ride to the auto parts store. The battery was too heavy for my bungee cords but the addition of this belt around it held it tight on my ride home!",

                "reviewText": "There is a bit of a learning curve with these plastic buckles. They seem very durable, my concern I would break them appear to have been unfounded. The buckle holds very firmly without the slipping that the metal buckles do. I'm sure in a few days I'll feel familiar with the new buckles and wonder why I tolerated the WWII Era design.",
