The fact that the buckle does not fit through the belt loops on my pants is a bit of a problem. But, since I usually wear my work pants for 2 - 3 days it's not too much of a hassle. And the quality of this belt is worth needing to reset it's length when changing pants. Will buy another one of these belts when it's needed. But, given it's high quality, I'm feeling that will be some time from now.",

Performing well so far.There is no play or stretch in the fabric, but its easy enough to micro-adjust to your exact measurements.This is a belt which is best for adding to a pair of pants that you intend to keep it on.Don't expect to take this bent on/off every night like you would a leather belt.This is because it has a buckle on both ends and it is difficult to push the buckle through you pant loops.You could slide the fabric out of the buckle every time to take it on/off, but then you will need to re-adjust every time to find that \"sweet spot\" that fits you perfectly.It is not a flaw of the belt; just typical of all belt of this design and something to keep in mind.I put them on and keep them on a pair of work pants that I don't wash every day.The buckle is quick and easy to open/close.Although, you will need to make sure that you fully push it together so that both lugs engage.A few times I didn't push it together hard enough and it popped apart when I didn't expect it.But if you latch it properly, there is no way it is coming open.All in all, a great belt, especially for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I have a 34 waist and had to cut a significant portion away, but better to get too much than too little. LOVE THIS BELT. I use to always run rigger's belts, but got tired of the velcro wearing out and the prices going up. This is a good sturdy belt which lets the wearer add stuff to their belt without getting undressed. Comes apart just as easily by unclipping the sturdy mechanism, or unlooping the belt itself. But it doesn't come off unless you want it to. Great tactical selection as long as you don't need a no-kidding rigger's belt with D-rings. I use it for hunting and every-day wear. Ordered three more after getting my first one. Good gift too.Update: This is not a rigger's belt, nor is it intended to be. If you're buying this thinking you've found a belt to rappel with, you need to keep looking. I've been wearing these for a couple years now and the mechanism hasn't worn down, and now I have green ones too. Still probably the best all-around belt you can get for the money. My latest ones came with at least a foot of extra material that is easily cut away. Stitching has held out through range wear, hunting wear, and working outdoors in the woods. They also come with a loop keeper that I take off because it's not needed. No complaints. Very happy!",

                "reviewText": "It appears to be a well made belt but one major problem was found. I tried it on and the belt seemed short. I measured it and found in the length of the belt advertised the overall length is 2 inches shorter than what they say. The length they advertise includes the two buckles and the 2 inches of nylon ran through the one buckle and flipped and sewn to its self. By the time you thread the other end through the other half of the buckle you have even less. I don\u2019t know why they even bother putting a loop on for the excess nylon. There won\u2019t be any. I\u2019m big so I ordered the 61 inch I thought the webbing would be 61\u201d Nope webbing, both buckles clasped but the second not threaded was 59 inch the other two inches where through the first buckle half and sewn to its self. Not happy.",
