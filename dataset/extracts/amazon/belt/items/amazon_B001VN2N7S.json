                "reviewText": "Extremely nice Levi\u2019s belt in the vary difficult to find anymore double prong setup! The leather is thick - but is somewhat dry so I\u2019m going to be conditioning the leather with a small amount of mineral oil and hair conditioner! The double retaining straps are very much appreciated! The bucket seems durable and should provide long life! My other belt is 32 years old - but still working! Blue Notes circa 1990 in Italian leather. Hopefully this bridle leather is just as good but it is fairly stiff and should be conditioned!This replacement Levi\u2019s screams quality! 40 mm (4 cm) wide! Okay - lots of debate about sizing! I have a 33 inch waist but I wear 34 inch waist pants\u2026.partly because 33 inch sizes are often difficult to find in pants but also because sometimes I like extra room for bending, and getting them off easier, etc. This 38 belt is 45 inches from tip to tip or 44 inches excluding the buckle! Measurement from leather end on bucket to the centre set of holes is 37.5 inches! This belt fits me very well if I pull it tight it leaves two sets of holes free to go tighter if I could\u2026.but would have to have a 32 waist to do so (I can\u2019t\u2026too tight). If I pull it comfortable it leaves three sets of holes free on either side! I understand it defies logic with a 38 belt that it fits my 34 inch waist perfectly but it does!!!! It also leaves enough belt to pass through the double retainer straps with about 3 inches coming out the other side, past the last retainer strap. The pictures I\u2019ve included to clear this sizing issue up don\u2019t lie! Based on what I\u2019m observing this black 38 Levi\u2019s belt is good for 33-36 inch waist sizes! I can not speak to other sizes but hopefully I have helped some people who are thinking about going with the 34 belt vrs tge 38 belt \u2026. If you are 33-36 I would go with the 38 belt. If you are 28 - 32 inch waist size - I would go with the 34 inch size! The 36 belt is no longer available so that\u2019s a non-debate item anyways! So yes - those that said order two belt sizes up are correct!!!!! Or order four inches more than your waist size are correct!!!! If you\u2019re a 34 inch waist then 34 + 4 = 38! Excellent belt!",
