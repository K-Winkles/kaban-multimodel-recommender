                "reviewText": "Yes. It is one of a kind this belt, the ends are nice.The fact that I've been doing it wrong the whole time, I didn't need a fully stretching belt, I needed a solid thin one made of fabric mostly.It supports my pants staying in one fixed position instead of falling down.This is a perfect belt for my job where I will have a tool belt on. Two metal belt buckles slamming against each other with their width and depth sucks, a piece of metal jabbing my stomach all day clanking around.You find yourself avoiding taking it apart half the time to take clothes off so it's cumbersome if so.Although I do place 5 stars for good work, I am myself an inventor and I wish to give a heads up.The belt needs very little, some, give, at either the center (back) or on one or two of the sides preceeding the majority of the velcro, like a rubber material. I would not place spandex or other rubber band or traditional stretching belt. You can't take away the solid feel.I would place just enough to allow pulling toward one side, because this nylon stuff you know, it's extremely stiff. When someone uses a traditional leather whatever belt with a buckle, they have leverage to tighten. This doesn't. You literally have to use all your might to bull the pieces together, and hopefully not snag it on too early or you're re-doing it.I also find that you need extra positioning to snug the upper layer into the pants belt loop, you find yourself needing to shift the entire belt to the left or right then back into its area, unless you don't care.It needs minimal expanding, or it needs a tool to tug it inward. A sliver of rubber that allows the belt to expand in one to 2 places for leverage",

Only thing I think they should do is put a second or third stich in the velcro. That's the main issue. the velcro is finally coming off. But I beat it to hell and it took 10 years to wear out.

The light weight construction makes me wonder about long term durability.This is a light weight belt. If you need to hang anything off your belt, this may not be the best choice.If you need to hold your pants up and stay comfortable, this is the belt for you.",
