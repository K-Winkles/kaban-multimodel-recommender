It fit perfect and I have no complaints, so no stars lost.Helpful Note: After dealing with this type of belt many times, I finally found a trick that makes it easier to install. Leave the belt incorrectly looped on the top of the idler pulley. Pull back the tensioner to loop the belt around the alternator pulley. Lastly, pull back the tensioner back again to move the belt from the top of the idler pulley to the underside. It is much easier to install in stages like this.",

After being on the car a couple weeks I noticed a slight rhythmic squeak on startup I didn't even associate with the belt immediately, though I should have known.A few days later it start SCREEEAAAMING at anything above idle and made no difference if I used belt dressing. I honestly thought I had a seizing pulley. I even thought I had it narrowed down to the alternator since it squeaked slightly when I had no belt on.Well ... I put the 70k mile OEM subaru belt back on and wonderful SILENCE (other than normal engine noises). It's been 3 weeks since I put the OEM belt back and it's still silent and perfect. I thought I should replace the belt after so many miles but... I guess I should just not with one of these.As always your experience may vary but I had a really annoying and embarrassing drive home from an hour away the day the gates belt finally began slipping badly. Everybody stared like I was obviously a moron driving a POS.I am lucky it was still running the water pump and alternator enough not to overheat or kill the battery. Sad.",
