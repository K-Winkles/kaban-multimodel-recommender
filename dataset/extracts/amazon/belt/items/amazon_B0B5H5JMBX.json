As you can see on both pictures, every hole that I fit in (#2 and 3) are folding and material is stretching a lot. Also the tip of the belt was rubbing on my pants while moving up/down and ripped off. I would like a new one with the true carharrt signature, with all the stiches that makes it invulnerable. So if you guys can manage either a refund or simply send me another belt adapted to my need, I dont mind shipping this one back to you and change my review once our situation is solved.",
