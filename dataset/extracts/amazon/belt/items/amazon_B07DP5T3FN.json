I'm not so sure that the buckle will last, since it's so light weight and flimsy. But more importantly, the belt buckle doesn't open very wide, so it's difficult to get the belt end out when taking off your pants. I don't trust the whole rig to attach any gear, so it's just a belt now, without the utility function. I ordered this to replace a straight loop through belt made by 5.11, since I thought it would be more convenient with a quick release buckle. That isn't the case. And with the price being about 60% higher, the value just isn't there.",

The belt can be used with light-weight tools, but I usually switch to a much heavier canvas belt if I am carrying my tool bags. It won't set off the metal detector at the airport, but they may ask you to take it off anyway -- fortunately this is very easy to do.The belt comes with a separate elastic loop that can be used as an extra belt loop if the end of the belt ends up at an inconvenient place. This loop is fairly easy to lose, but I like it enough that I make the extra effort to find it when it slips off.",
