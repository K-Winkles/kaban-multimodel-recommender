When he expressed that he wanted a ratchet belt, we first tried some more expensive leather sets, and all of them \u201creleased\u201d whenever he bent over for work, which is always.This belt, however, has taken him climbing on roofs, bending into water cans, army crawling under floors through crawlspaces, head-first into holes in the ground deeper than he is tall, and it hasn\u2019t embarrassed him once. He always comes back up, back down, or back out, fully dressed and dignified. He even crawls under the sink, and there is no moon to be seen. He is very pleased with it.",
