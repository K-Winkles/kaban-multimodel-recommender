                "reviewText": "This belt works as well as the $30 belt I was using and this one was much less expensive. My old one was a little wider and the release button a little longer. This belt will fit into pants with a more narrow belt loop and the shorter release button doesn\u2019t trigger when I bend over as the longer trigger button on my old one does. I\u2019ve been wearing it daily for over a month.",
