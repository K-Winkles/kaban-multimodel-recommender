I'd worn a seatbelt buckle-style belt for the past decade, but despised how unwieldy it was to tighten. In a matter of a couple months, I dropped two jeans sizes and found the belt had gone from unwieldy to downright unwearable.Dear reader, that's when I stumbled upon this belt. It met all of my criteria - not leather, all black, easy to latch and unlatch - and then some. It's lightweight, not intrusive when bending over, and matches my humble \"jeans and a black T-shirt\" aesthetic. I have worn plenty of prior to the one you're reading this review for, but I will be sticking with this brand/style for the years to come.",

                "reviewText": "I carefully measured my old belt, which was way too big nowadays, compared to the size diagram, and based on that, I bought the size L. Which should have left several inches extra to go through the belt loops and leave some room to adjust it a little bigger occasionally if needed. When I got it, and put it around my waist, the end of the belt could not even reach the buckle. I wear size 38/40. It was WAY too small. So I returned it, which I have almost never done on Amazon, and I almost picked XL but then decided to go with 2XL for safety, and this one fits, but there's seriously only maybe 3 or 4 inches of extra length, it just barely goes through the 2 loops on the belt behind the buckle, I don't think it will even reach to the first belt loop on most pants. I recommend going big or going home!!! It seems OK other than that but I only got it at my door 20 minutes ago, no idea how it will hold up.",
