Many comment that the leather cracks immediately after wearing it. After receiving mine and doing a quick quality check (Bend Test), it was clear that my belt would not be any different. It seemed very dry. So what do you do to something that's dried out? You moisturize it. After applying a quality leather moisturizer to the belt, it looks and feels great. No signs that it will crack. This is a good lesson for anyone new to leather. All leather requires maintaining, regardless. In this case, This belt needed a little TLC out of the box but it seems now like it will be a quality belt.",
