                "reviewText": "As someone who has struggled to find comfortable and long-lasting belts in the past, the Kenneth Cole compression belt has been a game-changer for me. I love how this belt clicks into place at more frequent intervals, ensuring a perfect fit every time. The small notches on the back of the belt provide just the right amount of support, even after two years of use. Although the belt buckle has some wear and tear from regular use, it still looks great and continues to hold up nicely. If you're looking for a stylish and reliable belt that will last, the Kenneth Cole compression belt is definitely worth checking out.Summary: Nice looking. Easy to use. Good Quality product",

                "reviewText": "This isn't my first Kenneth Cole ratcheting belt. I bought the Classic Brown option from this series as well.The Classic Brown one is 5-star. I love it. I wear it everyday for the last year or so when I wear my brown work Khakis.So, the quality is there. This black belt is very stylish, durable, and comfortable for a 34 inch waist on the Large size.I bought 2 of these. One for me and one for a Christmas gift. So, I was able to test 2 of them at the same time.The only issue I found was actually kind of terrifying at first. I ratcheted the belt to a snug fit and felt good. Then I tried to undo the \"release\" lever on the side of the buckle. This is a common design for the Kenneth Cole Perfect Fit belts. Well, it didn't \"click\" off and release pressure. I kept trying. I felt like I had to be doing something wrong or going the wrong direction. Pretty soon, I felt like a cat stuck in a bag handle. I was bouncing around, panicked it wouldn't release. I had to disrobe with the belt tight, which was painfully difficult. After the pressure of my waist was gone, holding my pants and belt in front me the lever popped easily to release pressure.I practiced several times to get used to the \"direction\" I had to go. It was the same as the other belt I own. I put the pants on again, and tightened the belt. Same problem, I was fiddling with the lever a lot and it wouldn't give. However, this time I knew how it worked. I gave it an extra effort beyond what I think is reasonable for this release and it popped. Definitely hurt the fingers a little bit. I checked the 2nd belt, and it was the exact same feel on the release.The 1st belt had some stretch to it and I concerned I broke it or loosed the buckled end. I actually took it a part and this is strong metal with a clamp system for the end of the belt to the leather. What I learned here is this product is a high quality belt that doesn't rely on some dinky set screws into leather to hold it together. Major plus here for long term durability, and trimming and fixing later.My advice when you get the belt, practice with the release before you put it on. Remember, it will take some doing to get the lever to pop and release the ratchet pressure. The quality, strength, and style greatly out weigh its one flaw. Plus, over time, it might release easier as it wears in.",

                "reviewText": "Update 1-15-24: After having this belt for a few months I have almost cut it off multiple times. If the belt is tightened \u201ctoo far\u201d it won\u2019t unlatch & I have had to do everything but cut it to get it off.Tough to unlatch and take off. To take off this belt, you need to pull on the belt as if you are going to tighten it & then unlatch the belt. I had to read other reviews before figuring this out and was about to cut the belt off and send it back. This is a nice quality belt however it is very tough to take off if not done exactly correct.",
