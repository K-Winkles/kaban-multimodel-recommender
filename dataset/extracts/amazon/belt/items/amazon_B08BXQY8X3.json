        "description": "We Create Thoughtful Products That Are Worth Holding Onto. Nickel zinc alloy buckle & top-grain smooth leather belt from CLUBBELTS is unlike any other. First, say goodbye to sloppy, misfitting belt holes. Instead, our unique spring-loaded, ratchet buckle interfaces with a hidden track sewn into the back of the leather belt, to provide over 40+ micro adjustment points. This means you can adjust your belt 1/4\" at a time for the perfect fit all day. It's a simple, secure system that will forever change the way you think about belts. How the belt is measured: When the strap is around your waist (and through your belt loops), how much extra is there? That's how much you should cut. How to trim: Make sure you cut the raw end that was inserted into the buckle, please cut less than you think you need to at first since you can cut more. How it works: 1. To remove your belt: Pull and hold the release lever, and then slide the strap out of the buckle. 2. If the belt is too tight: With the left hand index finger, pull and hold lever away from body, meanwhile relieve tension by pushing strap toward buckle with the right hand.

You can trim it to fit with a pair of scissors. The buckle clamps down on one end and holds it very well. You simply put the belt on and pull it through the buckle to fasten it. As you pull it through, the buckle ratchets onto the belt and holds in place, so you get a perfect fit that is not too tight or too loose unlike buckles that you have to put in one hole or the other, never getting that \u201cjust right\u201d feel. It is also very stylish.",
