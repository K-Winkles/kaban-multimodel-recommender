Looks fine with my dress slacks but wouldn\u2019t look out of place wearing it with jeans ! For the price it seems like a good value. Most belts made today don\u2019t last! The leather finish starts peeling or flaking around the hole where you have it to fit your waist over just a few months. Even more expensive brands costing $45-60+ hopefully this will last. It\u2019s imported though so time will tell. Years ago USA made belts lasted literally forever! Need to find one as well\u2026\u2026",
