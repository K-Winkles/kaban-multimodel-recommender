But note that the ball hook on the buckle is initially a good bit larger than the holes, and some break-in period is needed. As received, the hook is very difficult to push through a hole, and requires heroic effort to pull back out. After a month or so of wearing each day (using the same hole), it hooks and unhooks easily and is still secure.",

But it\u2019s still adequate to hold my pants up. The holes are small and tight. Which I suppose is a good thing. But hard to release the buckle, if you\u2019re in a hurry. I\u2019m sure it will loosen up with use. Overall, a good belt, I feel. Would recommend.",
