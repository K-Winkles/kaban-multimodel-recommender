                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars This is my new favorite casual belt. Looks great and lays very flat. Highly recommended.",
                "reviewText": "I love this belt. It's sharp looking in its elegant simplicity. It's amazingly lightweight because of the thin aluminum buckle and nylon webbing. There is virtually nothing to fail since it uses friction to lock into place. And because of that friction dependent design, it's infinitely adjustable.If you're looking for a nylon web belt for \"tactical\" use, this isn't what you want. The webbing is thinner, lighter, and more flexible than something that's going to carry a holster or other heavy load.This is a really sharp looking belt for dressing up a pair of jeans or other casual pants. It lays about as flat and thin as anything I've ever seen and it looks really sharp. The thinner versions probably look good with a suit or dress pants but I have only bought the 1.5\" version so far.I like the fact that you can buy one strap and buckle combo and then buy other straps or buckles to interchange them for different looks. That makes them a little less pricey and it cuts down on the number of belts you need in your closet.It took me about ten seconds to realize how it works and get comfortable putting it on or taking it off. I love the fact there's no flap at the end so you don't need to worry about belt loops.As far as fit, they recommend enough extra length so that the end of the belt ends up laying just beyond your first belt loop. I'm consistently a 34\" waist in pants so I ordered the 36\" belt and it fits me perfectly. Just enough length for the end to lay behind that first belt loop on a pair of Wranglers.Also, I bought the black nylon strap with the \"gunmetal\" buckle and the photos on Amazon are pretty accurate. The gunmetal is a dark gray, not black but not silver either.Edit 9/30/2018: So I liked the Black belt with the Gunmetal buckle that I initially ordered so much that I ordered 2 more straps in Khaki and Navy Blue and 3 more buckles in Black, Silver, and Blue.Now, with 4 different buckles and 3 different easily interchangeable straps I have effectively 4 X 3 or 12 different belts to choose from but, they only take up the space of 3 thin and light belts. So, I cleaned out my closet and got rid of a lot of my old casual leather and cloth and nylon web belts.Also, when I bought the first Grip 6 belt and buckle for $35 I thought that was a little pricey for a casual belt. But with the extra straps and buckles, the price per belt / look gets really reasonable. I paid $35 for the first belt and buckle. $20 each for 3 more buckles and $15 each for two more straps. Add that up and 35 + 20 + 20 +20 + 15 + 15 = $125. Divide $125 by the 12 different combinations I can make and the price per belt / look is about $10.42. That's pretty affordable and the bonus is that I don't have 9 belts cluttering up my closet, I only have 3 that can cover anything from backpacking to dinner at a nice restaurant.With that hardware, I can cover, black jeans, blue jeans, khakis, gray chinos, OD green cargo pants, my black ski pants, and all of those colors in shorts. That covers 95% of my needs. I'm pretty stoked about these belts.EDIT 1/10/2021: I've had these belts for about 2 1/2 years now and they have become the only belts I wear other than a dress belt with suits. I use them around the yard, backpacking, mountain biking, and for casual wear. They are comfortable and I've never had one slip on me. They stay put. And so far, they aren't even showing any wear.",

                "reviewText": "Holds my pants up just fine, doesn't require a lot of adjustment. Locks in just fine. The nylon belt itself is soft and malleable. This is a pro or con depending on what you want. The method of use is slightly annoying as it is a little difficult to adjust since you have to pull the belt through a slot and tuck it under the rest of the belt, then keep the buckle at an angle to be able to slide it across the nylon and adjust it's length while holding the loose end of the belt under the part attached to the buckle. Once you get the hang of it, it's not bad. If you like your belt really tight, this might be a problem, as you'd have to pass your desired length, and as soon as you let go, it'll be a little looser as the buckle comes down onto the belt.The slot locks the belt in place by it's angle, turning the nylon belt part at a sharp angle and creating the effect that sets that buckle right there. Infinitely adjustable.... but a bit more difficult if you want it tight. It's not real hard, just takes some getting used to.The buckle's color got scratched off right away, but by scraping it across some metal, not casually. Otherwise, it's held up pretty good. Looks like anodizing, maybe. I think it looks pretty sharp, overall, and is a good belt for what it is.For what it is, I don't know if the price is altogether justified. This is about as useful as those cloth belts with the double rings. It'll hold your pants up. If that's all you want, you're good to go.I own several nylon belts, and this one was advertised in similar spaces to those, so this may not suit folks who are looking for a more heavy duty belt. I figured that would probably be so, but I was in the market for a more casual belt in any case. We'll see how it survives under a hiking backpack, but I'm hoping this will be better suited to that.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve always loved interesting belts and owned a variety of differing styles, so I was keen to try this simple redesigned Grip6 belt out. It\u2019s got a great low profile buckle with the added benefit of fitting your waist exactly, instead of relying on a fixed set of hole sizes. So if you\u2019ve eaten too much, just readjust a touch and you\u2019re good to go. This Grip6 belt sits really snugly and doesn\u2019t work loose, whilst still looking great through out the day, no matter what you\u2019re doing either.I\u2019m a UK size 32\u201d (81.28cm) and bought a 105cm belt, but the 100cm belt would have worked too. So long as you choose a belt that\u2019s at least 5-10cm longer than your actual waist size you\u2019ll be fine.The only down side I can list isn\u2019t a Grip6 issue, but the import tax to the UK. I bought 2 of these belts and paid \u00a313 extra to get them after customs added their 29% and the Royal Mail added an \u00a38 handling charge!That still doesn\u2019t beat the fact that these are exceptional belts. Once I find a UK supplier, I\u2019ll be buying a lot more of them.",
