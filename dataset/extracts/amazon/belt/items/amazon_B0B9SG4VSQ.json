The only downside is that we can't get the handlebars tight enough so they wobble a bit. It's an exciting workout using YouTube workouts and my heartrate is very elevated the whole time- better than running!",

                "reviewText": "Several months ago I was actively searching for the cheapest spin bike that could somewhat replicate an outdoor bike and this is what I ended up buying. It's by no means high quality but it serves its basic function splendidly and has been very reliable. After almost seventy hours on the seat pushing the pedals, this is what I have to say.It arrived with every piece intact and accounted for and no cosmetic damage.Setup was very easy as all of the parts are basic and instructions are very clear.When putting it together I thought it might wobble but when riding it's actually quite stable.The components are a bit heavy but not to much for at most two people to handle, the wheels are hard plastic so I would be weary of damaging weak flooring while on the roll.I was able to adjust it to my body shape very easily and changing that isn't difficult at all.I find the seat very comfortable and its plastic device stand rather functional to be sure.The electronic measuring console isn't accurate at all but that doesn't matter for my purpose.Overall as a spin bike it performs higher then its cost and that says a lot with how expensive they are.",

We decided to go for this cycle and we are so glad we did. It's great!It is heavy, so it can be a bit tough to locate it the first time as you put it together, but it is very simple to assemble. Plus it comes with the tools you'll need to put it together along with the hardware. I never once venture to the garage for my better tools - no need to do so.It is compact, but it still good for my wife who is 5'2\" and myself at 6'1\". It it quick to adjust and it is very stable. Whisper quiet too. I could not even hear my wife using it at all while in the same room.It is very well made out of heavy duty materials and should hold up for a long time.RECOMMENDED!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this bike for my mom and I to use at home while watching TV. Shipping was fast, and we were both impressed with the quality of the materials in the bike. The bike itself is very sturdy and solid. The only pieces that are a bit lower/standard quality are the digital timer/calorie counter and the plastic clip-on stand for a phone/iPad. There's nothing wrong with those, they're just nothing special.I was able to put the bike together in about half-an-hour from the box - it was easy and all tools were provided.The bike has a large range with fine differences for resistance and is very easy to reach and adjust during use. The bike is very quiet - at low resistances it is almost silent, and only gets to a soft hiss at higher resistance.The pedals are nice metal pedals with adjustable 'baskets' for one's feet - personally I find those baskets annoying and so I just use the back side of the pedals (where they naturally hang, anyway, due to the weight of the baskets) and that works very well for me. I am not doing any extremely fast or high power spinning or anything like that, so I cannot say if the baskets would be more important with that kind of use.The seat is moderately comfortable - it is a little hard, but I have never found one that I didn't find hard with longer use, personally. Also, my mom and I are 5'3\" and personally I wish the seat could be lowered about another inch, but this seems to be the way bikes are made in general - I find the same issue with all real bikes and realistic indoor bikes that aren't recumbent. Also it might be nice if the handlebars could go up about another inch for us short people. Still pretty comfortable.The height of the seat can be adjusted many inches, and it has a few inches of adjustment toward or away from the handlebars. The handlebars also have several inches of vertical adjustment possible.The heartrate monitor seems to work just fine but I haven't tried to compare it to another one for accuracy. I just ride for time, and adjust the resistance according to how I feel.Another thing I appreciate about this bike is that it has a pretty small footprint - it doesn't take up a lot of room and tucks into a corner easily. It can also be moved and has wheels on the front for that purpose. I would not suggest that an 85 year old with quite limited upper body strength do that because it does involve tipping the bike up on an end, but for the average user it is a piece of cake. The bike can also be moved just by sliding it around, especially if not on carpet.If you want a quiet, smaller, sturdy cardio machine at a lower price point, I don't think you can do better than this. I have purchased machines slightly under the price of this one before and the leveling up in quality with this one is huge compared to those.",
