                "reviewText": "I bought this bike to get through sheltering in place meaning I would not have access to my normal spin studio. To preface this review, I am not a cycle instructor, I am not someone trying to compare this to Peloton, but I am someone who takes about 5 spin classes a week regularly and rides upwards of 80-90 miles in those classes aggressively. I am partial to Schwinn carbon blue spin bikes as such (which I view as the gold standard for studio cycling) but didn\u2019t want to drop $2700 for a bike at home since part of the joy of spinning for me is a classroom setting. And I didn\u2019t feel the need to buy a Peloton (though as others have mentioned the app is great, I actually think the yoga on it is fantastic too!!) since if you give me music I can pretty much push myself at this point with as much as I ride to come up wit a great workout. So what I needed was a sturdy bike with a heavy flywheel, and since it\u2019s for home, a low noise factor. This bike does all of that and pretty much so far (been riding it for two weeks) exceeds my expectations in most all areas. I made a few \u201cupgrades\u201d at a really reasonable cost and here are what they were and my thoughts..First the bike was very easy to assemble! I am by no means a bike mechanic so I took my sweet time putting it together and even doing so it only took about 45mins. Note that this sucker is heavy though! I am in pretty good shape and I could not have gotten it out of the box easily by myself. But once that was done I was able to assemble solo without issue. It comes with virtually every tool you\u2019ll need for assembly but ordering a Swiss army style bike tool on Amazon is not a bad idea since you\u2019ll want to be sure to maintain the bike. I also am a VERY firm believer that it\u2019s crazy pants, even if you are new to indoor cycling, to ride without cycle shoes and spd pedals. It literally makes the whole exercise less effective (and frankly harder as well) I can not stress this enough! So I opted to order a pair of shimano spd pedals (I went with PD-M520 for about $50) to add to the bike instead of the supplied caged pedals. Also, since the bike does not have a monitor I bought a Wahoo cadence tracker (about $30) which I opted to add to the pedal arm to track distance and rpm. The wahoo app is great and even lets you scroll between tracking settings and your music playlist as you ride.Things that rock about this bike:It\u2019s ridiculously quiet, I can\u2019t understand why anyone would say otherwise, I literally have never heard a bike that is more quiet than this. The flywheel is super heavy and the magnetic resistance is seamless which is great if you are into a lot of micro resistance adjustments like I am. The thing I was most worried about before this arrived was the stability (or potential slipping..) of the handlebars based on another review I read. This has NOT been my experience. Everything cranked into place solid. I think that person must have had some sort of defect with their bike. The other concern I was pleased to learn was not a concern was the stability of smaller foot stabilizers. This thing sits solid even when riding standing at a good pace.Things that could have been better:The height of the handlebars. Granted since I move around a lot on a studio bike I like mine towards the higher end of the spectrum, but these still sit slightly low for me fully extended. It\u2019s by no means dramatic and does not effect my ride or make me feel it\u2019s inhibiting getting the most out of my bike it just would have been great to get another inch out of the arm. The other thing that is frankly more impactful is the seat. Clearly so folks would feel it was \u201ccomfortable\u201c the seat has a bit too much cushion to the rear of it. So much that it almost pushes you forward. I get what Sunny was doing for comfort, but if you need \u201dcomfort\u201d out of your exercise bike you need to re-evaluate your dedication to actually exercising would be my perspective on this;-)So overall I am very pleased thus far. I am hopeful that this continues to hold up well for a few months (which is all I need.. I hope\ud83d\ude4f). It truly in the first few weeks here has been of the same quality I am used to in various studios with bikes 5 to 6 times the price! I\u2019ll be sure to update should my experience change.",

                "reviewText": "***Update July 2023: Still loving this bike. I have probably \u201ccleaned\u201d around the belt and wheels 2-3 times since owning it for general maintenance. I did begin to get a slight noise after about a year and put a small amount of oil in the bearings and that took care of it. I can tell that it\u2019s getting close to needing the same treatment again.***Original review: I\u2019ve been taking Les Mills spin classes for ten years and began researching bikes at the beginning of the coronavirus apocalypse. I wanted a solid bike for the price without spending $2k. The amazon and YouTube reviews led me here. Because I\u2019m used to Les Mills RPM and Sprint I was not looking for a bike with \u201cextras\u201d like cadence or resistance info as riding to music motivates me the most.Straight forward assembly. Ran into a problem inserting the handlebar post into the frame because the plastic was slightly warped (see photo). But my husband helped \u201cmanhandle\u201d it into place and it worked smoothly afterwards. Apart from that, I assembled it myself with a 3 and 5 year old \u201chelping\u201d. That was more stressful than anything else. I replaced the pedals with clip-in pedals I already had and they fit well.I was concerned about my height for this bike since so many reviews state it\u2019s not for short people. My husband is 6\u20194\u201d so I consider myself short at 5\u20194.5\u201d but the bike fit me great. After a couple rides I found the best fit at 6 on the seat post (1 being the shortest). I\u2019m still tweaking but there\u2019s plenty of room to work with. Measuring your inseam is important. Mine is about 29.5. Keep in mind, I\u2019m using clip-in pedals so that will add very slightly to my inseam length.I actually found the bike seat to be a little too comfortable. The very rear of the seat is a little broader than I\u2019m used to from the gym bike but really something I can get used to.My first pedal stroke with the resistance maxed out had me concerned that it would not be enough for me. But as I\u2019m not used to magnetic resistance, I soon learned . . . it\u2019s deceiving. After my first ride, I realized I did not need it even close to maxed out to get an effective workout. The bike is super quiet with the magnetic resistance and belt drive. It has a very stable frame for hill climbing. I can see the frame move in my mirror but I can\u2019t feel it.It seems that the biggest problem reviewers have is with shipping. As long as your bike arrives well packaged this is a great bike for an effective workout. I\u2019ve only had the bike for 5 days so far but I\u2019ve ridden it everyday for 30-45 minutes with no issues.",

                "reviewText": "Through the years I have worked out on many spinning bikes besides owning a few. I purchased the SF B1805 as a second exercise bike for my country house and therefore did not want top pay too much. The purchase is quite recent but I am astounded by the value.First it come very carefully packaged which says something about the care the company puts in its product.Installation is simple and quick without any challenge. Aesthetically the bike is very pleasing.It is totally soundless however fast you pedal and absolutely stable. The magnetic resistance a charm to work with.The saddle is of the wide and cushy style and suits me fine even though I am more accustomed to the narrower and harder style. I\u2019ve had the bike for only two weeks and can\u2019t find any fault with it. I should have waited longer to write a review but I am too enthusiastic about it. Due to the quality of the frame,the parts and the ride I do not expect to be disappointed.I solved the problem of not being eligible to the warranty (restricted to the US) by purchasing the Asurion protection plan offered by Amazon fpr some sixty dollars.A note to the aficionados: this model does not come with any screen nor any machinery that computes time, revolutions, heartbeats and such like.Jacques, Montr\u00e9al",

The first thing to say is it is damned heavy and no way could one man deliver it.To make this short I'll just say it is packaged superbly and it is so quick and assemble. Allow 30 mins and this includes making a coffee half way through. The bike is real quality and when built is so sturdy. I did 20 mins just to try out and its so smooth and whisper quiet. My only real complaint are the pedals. They have straps on one side but the other is missing SPD cleat fastenings and I've searched all over and can't get them so basically you need to buy new pedals if you want SPD clip ins on the opposite side to the straps. No way near a deal breaker but the addition of them would be the cherry on the cake.Anyhow you may have guessed I'm impressed with the quality and the ride so hopefully when I get more miles In the bike will continue to deliver. I will add as a final point there is no screen or any readout so if you want cadence and heat rate you will need to buy something like a Wahoo cadence sensor and I would recommend the Wahoo tickr arm worn heart rate rate monitor paired with a mobile phone and the Wahoo fit app.Happy ridingMike",

Acabo de entrar en la publicaci\u00f3n y ahora est\u00e1 en $29,000 (20/ene/21) por lo que quiz\u00e1s vale la pena esperar un poco a que baje de precio.PROSEstuve haciendo mucha investigaci\u00f3n antes de decidirme a comprar esta bicicleta. Hay una comparativa en Youtube vs la Schwinn IC4 y en todo es mejor la Sunny excepto en los \"accesorios\" de cadencia, velocidad y pantalla. Aun comprando esos accesorios aparte, como el Garmin Speed and Cadence Sensor 2 me sali\u00f3 m\u00e1s barata.En comparaci\u00f3n contra otras bicicletas m\u00e1s baratas de Sunny o las gen\u00e9ricas chinas, la bicicleta se siente hecha con materiales de gran calidad, es pesada y s\u00f3lida por lo que no se mueve ni balancea nada ni aunque est\u00e9s pedaleando de pie y a m\u00e1xima potencia. La rueda de 44lb hace que el pedalear se sienta sumamente fluido.Sin embargo, el atributo principal de esta bicicleta es que es SUMAMENTE SILENCIOSA. Al tener resistencia magn\u00e9tica y transmisi\u00f3n por banda, no emite sonido alguno. He usado la bicicleta pedaleando a toda potencia junto a mi esposa viendo la televisi\u00f3n (a menos de 1.5m de ella) y no hace ning\u00fan ruido. Es perfecta para poder pedalear sin molestar a los dem\u00e1s.Tiene ajuste en 5 posiciones: altura de poste, distancia de asiento, inclinaci\u00f3n de asiento, altura de manubrio y distancia de manubrio. Normalmente las bicicletas no tienen el ajuste de distancia de manubrio. El ajuste es continuo y por presi\u00f3n, es decir que no tiene orificios en donde trabe la palanca de ajuste por lo que se puede hacer un mejor setup.La bicicleta viene casi en su totalidad armada por lo que completarla s\u00f3lo me llev\u00f3 unos 30 o 40min.El asiento es lo m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo que haya tenido en bicicletas de ya sea de spinning, de monta\u00f1a o de ruta. La calidad de los materiales es buena y la comodidad es insuperable.Los accesorios que tiene como el soporte para tablets/smartphones es muy conveniente ya que puedes poner en la tablet videos o apps como Peloton o Zwift para hacer clases. Simplemente es un soporte en el manubrio que no sujeta el dispositivo pero como la bicicleta es muy s\u00f3lida no se mueva ni hay riesgo de que se caiga. El manubrio tiene para todas las posiciones de clases de spinning.CONTRAS (ver fotos)No s\u00e9 si es un contra pero los imanes que hacen la resistencia se ve que est\u00e1n pegados con silic\u00f3n al caliper. Est\u00e9ticamente se ve \"feo\" aunque no parece que se vayan a soltar.El segundo contra que le pondr\u00eda son los pedales. Tienen la jaula de pl\u00e1stico suave y correas para sujetar el pie pero me hubiera gustado que del otro lado del pedal tuviera clips. Los pedales se sienten s\u00f3lidos y bien construidos, lo \u00fanico que no me gusta es el color met\u00e1lico brillante que le da una apariencia de ser de menor calidad al resto de los componentes que son de aluminio cepillado. Son detalles menores contra la gran calidad de la bicicletaENV\u00cdOLa caja ven\u00eda sumamente maltratada y abierta en varios puntos (por aduanas pero no la volvieron a cerrar) pero no le faltaba nada. La caja es muy voluptuosa y pesada por lo que es un trabajo de dos personas acomodarla. No pudimos cargarla para subirla al segundo piso porque no tiene agarres as\u00ed que lo que hicimos fue abrirla y dejar s\u00f3lo el marco principal para que fuera m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil cargarla. A\u00fan as\u00ed mi esposa y yo batallamos un poco para subirla. CONCLUSIONExcelente bicicleta para hacer ejercicio y poder hacer clases de cualquier intensidad. Vale la pena pagar el extra por la resistencia magn\u00e9tica, transmisi\u00f3n por banda y las 44lb de la rueda delantera. S\u00ed vuelve a bajar el precio es una excelente oferta.",
