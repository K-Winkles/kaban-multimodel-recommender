Many of the reviews say that it is cheap and the buckle will not last, but I cannot see this buckle breaking any time soon. I have a U S Military issue web belt and and it is no better made than this one. I am ordering another. As far as length goes, it is made to fit almost any size. Just flip open the latch on the back of the buckle and adjust to the length you need. You can cut the excess with a sharp knife or razor.",
