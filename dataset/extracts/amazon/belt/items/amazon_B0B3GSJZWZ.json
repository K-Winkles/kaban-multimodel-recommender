I know it is from China, but starting with the expensive looking packaging to the ease of customizing the length, it is very impressive. I've owned two of these belts and they are clearly better than all the old leather belts I've had before that crack and wear out long before they should. There are a number of companies that sell the identical belts so I recommend ordering from the cheapest available. They are all reasonable priced.",

                "reviewText": "I really like these belts and will be buying another one to replace the one that just broke. I have now had 3 of these belts and 2 of them have broken in the same way. The belts themselves cosmetically hold up well, the one in the photos are showing some wear, but this is from nearly 12 months of daily use. The first belt I bought in 2021 I wore daily for approximately 21 months before it broke. I have seen other reviews with the same complaint, but the pawl which engages with the teeth of the belt is a cast part and will eventually break. This normally isn\u2019t a problem, my first belt broke when I was putting the belt on, and it was simple to just take the belt back off. My second belt that just broke did so when I was going through airport security and failed in such a way that it did not want to disengage the belt. So that made for an awkward encounter with airport security trying to explain why I couldn\u2019t take my belt off. I would like to see BOSTANTEN improve this component, but at this price point I am mostly happy with these belts and will continue to buy them.",
