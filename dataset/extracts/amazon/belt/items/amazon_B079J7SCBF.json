                "reviewText": "I bought this belt for everyday use but had issues after a month. For anyone debating if they should go cheap or buy a quality belt, I have some things to say that may help you decide. The belt DOES look nice. This belt DOES stretch. This belt DOESN't have accurate sizing; I bought a size larger (32) than my pant size, as was suggested, but it barely fit in the second hole. After exchanging it for a size 34 it fit well in the 3rd hole, but fast forward one month later, it gradually stretched out to where I was buckling in the 5th (last) hole. I was tucking my shirt in during this time and that may have caused some stretching. So my suggestion is to get a belt one size bigger than your pant size if you tuck in your shirts because it definitely WILL stretch. The bottom line is, if you need a RELIABLE belt that you know will keep your pants up, I would look elsewhere. It's a good belt, but it's going to act like the price tag reflects, cheap, which is to be expected.",
