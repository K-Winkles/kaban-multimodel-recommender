Good quality. I looked through descriptions of various belts and chose this one for its looks, sturdiness, and durability. Perfect fit too. It could be worn with slacks or jeans. Love it!",

Tail of the strap is 2 inches too long in the first place - I guess so the mfgr could emboss their name - totally unnecessary.",
