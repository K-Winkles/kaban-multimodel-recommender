Compared with other belts, our stretch belt is more durable, not easy to deform, and has better elasticity. Does this nylon belt have holes? No, but the men's belt nicely fits any length you want by fitting into spaces between the fabric and it is very well made! Is the belt buckle metal free? The belt buckle itself is metal. There is a leather loop that holds the belt to the waist for a smoother look. How can I compare the size for women? The size chart with the item listing shows the various sizes explained in inches. As an example, medium is 32\" to 34\". This is not gender specific. If my belt breaks, can I have it replaced? We offer a one-year promise on our belt, within one year of purchase you can ask us and we will be happy to assist you.",

Just hangs down at the end slightly, but not enough too bother me too much. Therefore, be careful on the length you choose. That can be tough to calculate, decide, and guess on.

                "reviewText": "I wasn't sure what to expect buy this belt. I'm glad I did now. It's sturdy, durable and looks great. Well-made, and fits perfectly. It takes some getting used to in threading the clasp through the material, but I found this to be a benefit and not a concern once you get used to it. I really like the stretch too. Note, the material is stiff, but I feel that's a good thing.",
