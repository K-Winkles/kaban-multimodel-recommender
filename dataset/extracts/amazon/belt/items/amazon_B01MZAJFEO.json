                "reviewText": "I bought this belt because my weight and my waist size fluctuates a lot and the stretchiness of this belt made it easy to change sizes without adjusting the strap. The belt itself is nice and soft, and the elasticity is fairly forgiving. It is not going to squeeze your waist, but instead will keep your pants comfortably tucked to where you put them on. The side release buckles feel pretty sturdy as well. It is made out of plastic but it feels well built. I have only worn this product for a few days so far but no complains as of now. As of styling, it is nothing special. I do however always wear my shirt over my belt and pants so its not visible to others. Overall, I'm happy with the Arcade Belt and do recommend it to others.",

I wore it in a trip and walked right through security with it on because the buckle is plastic\u2014a nice feature. So far I\u2019ve been impressed with the quality of the material\u2014time will tell how long it lasts. I can tell the belt looks a bit curved after I wear it for a while, but as it\u2019s made of fabric that is expected.",
