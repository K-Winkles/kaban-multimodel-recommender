                "reviewText": "The belts look great. Two buckles, one chrome, one brushed. The ratcheting mechanism on these belts isn't as smooth or \"clicky\" as I've seen on other belts of a similar type. One drawback that all these belts seem to have is the way the buckle attaches to the belt. The teeth of the clamp end up pushing the belt back out some, so when you get it locked in place, it's only holding on to the very tip of the belt, less than a 1/4 inch of leather. If they just made this pocket a tiny bit deeper so the belt would slide further in, adjusting for this backing-out, I think it would make the belt a lot more usable. I've had some in the past that failed because of this, so I've learned to leave them a little longer than I really need, so when it does eventually give way, I can just cut it again and start with a new section. Otherwise, a good buy and a good belt.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars comparison of Chaoren and Mio Marino ratchet belts with photos",
                "reviewText": "I got this order of two belts, one black one brown, November 2019. These are the first ratchet belts I've ever had. So far I like them a lot. I use them every day, and like others find them fast, easy, convenient. I've not had good luck with conventional belts lasting, maybe I pull them in too tight, but I find the surface cracks and before long they don't look good, especially where the holes are. These ratchet belts don't have the holes obviously, and since you never bend them way back to fasten, so far they have held up like new.I do like how fast you can pull the lever and it pops open.The ad says the buckle is light, it certainly is NOT. The weight of the buckle does tend to pull the belt down a bit in front if worn loosely. But then again, the buckle seems pretty heavy duty and substantial.I liked these Chaoren belts, so I thought I'd try the Mio Marino that seemed to have more choices for straps and buckles. I got a flat black finish buckle and flat (not shiny) strap for weekends, yard work, and so forth. See photos.I prefer the Chaoren belt over the Mio Marino, but only because the track that the buckle engages, is extended closer to the tip, so I have only a small stub protruding out the buckle. Personal preference. You can see what I'm talking about in the picture.Otherwise, I think the same factory probably makes these, as the buckle mechanics are completely identical, and the straps are stitched and made identically. Even the gift boxes they came in are very similar.The replacement straps should work in either buckle too, as they are the same in width and thickness. I got the 1 and 1/8th width by the way, these belts are also sold in a 1 and 3/8th, so be sure you are ordering what you want.Are they leather? I think the underside is, I think the finished outer layer is synthetic. I took the part I cut off (remember you cut these to length yourself, you'll want some heavy scissors, I used tin snips) and put a flame to it and it sure seemed like the surface (outer) layer melted and smelled like burning rubber. But then there is some kind of artificial filler between the inner and out layers.They both are cut to fit (go long at first and try it), then the strap is slid into the buckle and you flip down a latch with teeth that hold it. They've stayed attached with no issues so far, and if it pulls the end of the belt off I guess I can trim a little and resnap it down. See the closeup pics.So yes, I really like the ratchet idea, I liked the Chaoren because the track goes nearer the tip, and otherwise the Chaoren and Mio Marino are pretty much identical, at least the ones I got.Finally, give me a \"helpful\" click if this helped you out.Update November 2021: the belts are still holding up fine, one I wear to work 5 days a week. I forgot I was wearing my weekend Mio Marino once when I jumped in swimming, didn't seem to hurt it. Just the once though.Update December 2022: they still work fine!",
