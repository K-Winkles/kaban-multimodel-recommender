This belt did not hold up his pants at all it's like it's stripped so as we switched out the buckle with another buckle didn't work so I'm not sure if the canvas isn't holding the threads of the the tightener or what happened but he's still without a bell because I've tried to fix it and just not working it's not like he's 500 lb it's just not a very sturdy belt and does not work or this particular one I got didn't work.",

                "reviewText": "Fits waists up to 49 inches. If your size is smaller, just carefully cut off what you don't need. Should last years. Several colors including black. Once the simplicity of this \"military\" style belt is mastered, you will wear it before other belts. Good for you for buying this belt. Nice Dickies logo on buckle, looks sharp. Dickies belt loops are made for this belt.",

                "reviewText": "The belt was really nice. I like the buckle style also but I had to return it because it was a 1.5 inch wide belt and it wouldn't fit thru the Dickies pants loop.Also, should change the logo style like the one used in the black 1.25 inch black belt buckle. It looks quieter and classier. The size of the logo installed on the 1.5 inch buckle should be as in the 1.25 inch buckle. Honestly, I maybe would've kept the belt if the logo style was metal (as previously mentioned) like the 1.25 inch belt.",

                "reviewText": "I had higher hopes for this belt, but was able to fix its shortcomings pretty easily. The buckle would often fall off when I was undoing it in the bathroom. Twice it fell into the toilet below...once at a client's house, and they hadn't flushed it!! Luckily, I had one of those telescoping, magnetic pick-up tools in my truck toolbox, so I was able to retrieve it without things getting too gross. I fixed it by cutting off about an inch off the buckle end of the webbing, and using that to increase the thickness of the belt where the buckle's sawtooth \"jaw' clamps come down. That made the buckle/fabric joint much more tight. No more flying buckles after that! Another problem was that the little roller that slides in the buckle slot sometimes would get hung up and not go back into its little resting slot....also very annoying. I fixed that by prying the slot apart just a little bit using a flat blade screwdriver. From this point on, I am hoping its smooth sailing!",

I don\u2019t like that it\u2019s hard to get the clamp to hold on to the side you trim on the belt buckle. I yanked at it to make sure it would hold once I took off the white tag that was sticking out from under the clamp and it took two or three times before it would hold the belt. Haven\u2019t had any issues ever since.I will say the only weird thing I noticed was that the first one I purchased about a year ago has a little bit of a blackish look to the background of the buckle and the one I just recently purchased is SILVER silver. No black background at all. Not a big deal but it was unexpected since I did click buy again and was slightly thrown off when I got it and the color was different",
