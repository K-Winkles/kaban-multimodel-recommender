                "reviewText": "This is an impressive trainer bike, solidly built and at an excellent price point (under $400 with Black Friday discount and including air shipment). Unit was well-packaged and arrived intact after a long transit. Assembly was straightforward and simple; the basic hand tools supplied with the unit were just adequate (I switched to my own tools to ease the process). After assembly everything worked perfectly- the magnetic drive/brake system is impressively quiet. Crank arms are compatible with road cycling pedal systems (I installed Speedplay pedals). Display screen is not very bright but its mount can be angled to optimize viewing. Bluetooth enables connection with a variety of cycling apps. Neither the water bottle cage or its mounting location are ideal for the user (this is a minor nit). Overall, following the first few hours of its use I'm very happy with this trainer.",

                "reviewText": "I love my new bike! It was very easy to assemble with easy to follow directions. I can use both my IPad and my computer in the holder provided while riding, which makes for great workouts. I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews due to some of the issues but decided to give it a try anyway. I'm so glad I did! Once it was assembled and I took my first 'test ride', there was a noise when I pedaled, which I read in the reviews that for some was the brake pad. But upon further inspection, it was actually the plastic belt guard behind the wheel. After removing the screws from the plastic guard and readjusting its position, there has been no more noise. I could literally see where the belt was brushing up against the inside of the plastic guard cover. I can't believe how quiet it is!It is a very solid machine - there's not one part on it that I thought was 'cheap'. It is very structurally sound. It does not wobble or move while riding, no matter how fast you go.Some things to remember: As the previous reviews mention, the box is extremely heavy - have someone help you get it into your home or room where you will be using it. Me and my husband carried mine into the room where I wanted to assemble it and after he left for work, I cut the box open on all sides and assemble it while still sitting on the cardboard to make it easy on myself.The right pedal is attached by twisting the pedal clockwise; the left pedal must be attached by turning it COUNTER CLOCKWISE. So right pedal turn to the right to attach; left pedal turn to the left to attach.Once assembled, it was super easy to get my bike to the room where I planned to use it, as it has wheels on the front end. All you have to do is tip the bike forward until the wheels his the floor, and then push or pull the bike to the desired location. Simple and easy - I love it!The seat is the most comfortable seat I've had on a bike. I ride a road bike and trust me, I've been through a lot of seats to find comfort. This one is great. The weights that come with it are very handy to add some arms into the workout.I would recommend the Yosuda Pro Max. It has been a great purchase.",

Easily adjusts to different sized riders. Why I gave it 4 stars is the monitor could be much better. It is dark and even with all my lights on in the room I can barely read the information it provides. I have to use my phone light to read about my progress. If they ever upgrade it to where it has a lighted background, let us users known. I would actually pay for it. If it wasn\u2019t for the monitor I would have given it 5 stars...Note added later: I clipped a small inexpensive book light onto it and now I can see the display easily.",

The resistance levels are perfect and definitely make for a tough workout. Very solid bike that can easily be sold for more. Instructions were clear as day. One small issue that I had is the screen is a bit hard to see in the light and at certain angles. Not a dwal breaker for me as I don't really use it anyways because I wear an HR monitor for tracking.",

The build quality, fit and finish is very good and the ride is stable, smooth and very quiet. Plastic components have good thickness and are very durable. The electronic monitor could really use a back-lit screen; not a deal breaker imho because the digital readout is large enough. The seat is a bit hard, but I'm guessing it is due to the fact it's new and it will soften up over time. The rollers are similar to those found on rollerblades and not the hard square edged type; maneuverability on both carpet and hard surfaces is excellent.",

The bike suits my needs in that it is sturdy and operates mechanically, hence there is little to break down. It is quiet and somewhat comfortable to sit on. The one weakness which others have commented on is that the screen that gives the speed, distance, rpm's etc. is very difficult to read in normal room light. I find myself using the light on my cell phone to illuminate the screen. Please note, as the manufacturer states, that this bike does not measure heartbeat, nor does it give the level of resistance if that is important to you.",
