However, when I lean against my kitchen counter my position will sometimes press the release latch and the belt will loosen, but it's not an issue.",

I will no longer use the traditional type belt over these ratchet belts. They work so well and are so easy to use. First, they look and feel as if they are made extremely well of good quality materials.My initial purchased belts for myself have now been worn hundreds of times and they look and work almost as if they did from day one. There is almost no distortion of the belt material like you get from a traditional belt. The ratchet latching works as good today as the very first time I used them. The finish still looks like brand new as well. My Son liked them so well he purchased a set of these for himself and has had the same great experience. I later purchased a set for another of my Son's. There are many different styles to choose from and of the 6 my family owns, they all look and function great.",

Although, I cut as instructed after holding it around my waist and ended up cutting more, so the tail wasn't as long. The belt looks and feels great. Had no problems attaching the buckle, follow the instructions and it held all day. The only con is that the release button is so small, it will take some getting use to to release the ratchet. This is a very good belt for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this belt for 3 months now and just bought a couple more in different colors because this one has held up so well. I wanted to try a ratchet belt as I've always found myself in-between notches on a regular belt. This works exactly how I expected and is so much more comfortable! It was easy to cut down to size; I'm not really sure how people are messing that step up. I cut mine as directed and felt it was too long, so I went back and cut a few more inches off. It was easy to remove the buckle to do so. The belt has some kind of finish on the edges and it has been peeling off in a very small strip on the front of the belt - I think this was excess material and it doesn't affect the overall look at all. I usually have cheap leather belts like this come apart quickly, but with the ratchet design it doesn't wear on the belt like a traditional buckle would, so I hope it will last longer. You can spend 2-3x as much on other ratchet belts and you might get better quality, but for the price you can't go wrong with this one!",

                "reviewText": "Update May 7, 2021: It's been almost 3 years. This belt is still worn daily. It's looking a bit scratched up, but the mechanism still works like it was brand new. The belt is separating in places and falling apart. I've had to cut additional pieces off the buckle end of the belt because the teeth that hold the buckle to the belt stopped gripping the belt and would fall off at inopportune times.All in all, I've worn this belt, daily -- even throughout the pandemic -- for 36 days short of 3 years and it still is wearable and the mechanism works like new, but it is worn, and it is time to replace it. I will buy another one just like it.Update May 17, 2019: It's been almost 1 year. This belt has been worn daily. For the most part, it still looks and works like new. But I have one complaint that I didn't have a year ago. The buckle portion has started falling off the belt every few days or so. The teeth that grab the end of the belt no longer hold it securely. I will need to cut another half inch off the end and re-seat the teeth into the end of the belt so it holds it tight again. No stars removed from my review.End of Update.I LOVE this belt. I will wear a belt until if falls apart. For me, that's often 3 to 5 years of everyday use. Then comes the time to buy a new belt and I can never remember how to size a belt. Is it my waist size? Is it an inch or two longer or shorter? I just never remember. This belt is truly a one size fits all and it's up to me to cut it to size. The instructions in the product description said to add 9 inches to my waist size and cut the belt at that length. The instructions that came with the belt, said to add 7 inches to my waist size and cut the belt at that length. I chose to err on the side of caution and add 9 inches to my waist size and make the cut there. I figured that I could always cut it again if it was too long. Well, with waist + 9 inches, it really is too long, but I've been wearing it like that for a few weeks now.When the belt was brand new, I could hear the crispness of the ratchet. But now with a few weeks of wear, the ratchet sound is much quieter. I'm hopeful that it just means that it's getting broken in, not worn out. But still, I've got another couple of inches to cut off, so if it wears out, I can cut it again, which will move the spot where the ratchet catches and it should work like new again.I would definitely buy this belt again. I might even buy a couple others in different colors. And certainly they would make good gifts.",
