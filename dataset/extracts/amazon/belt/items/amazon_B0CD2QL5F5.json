The buckle is very stylish and amazingly easy to use. This type of buckle has come a long way with the improvement of the method of release being just a push of a lever.The belt is very easy to trim to a perfect size with scissors if desired.Quality of the belt and buckle seem to be excellent.I'll be purchasing another of this type in the near future!",
