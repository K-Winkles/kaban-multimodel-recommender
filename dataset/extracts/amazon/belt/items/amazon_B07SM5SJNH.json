                "reviewText": "These belts are of an excellent quality. Because they are made with mesh you get a very \"good fit\" since they don't have holes like the regular belts do. These belts also have a stretch like material that helps make them feel very comfortable when wearing them.I would say if in doubt as to what size to order, you may be better off ordering the larger size. In my case, my waste is a size 38. They offer two sizes in that category. The smaller size is 36 - 40 and the larger size is 38 - 42. I ordered the smaller size and when I wear the belt only the end part can comfortably go through the buckle holder. However with the stretch feature, it still feels good and fits well. As a result, I do recommend these belts for purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Recently bought the \"2pack-black/Beige1286\" version of these stretch belts and have been absolutely loving them. They're exactly as described, appear to be very high quality, have a great amount of stretch, and look absolutely fantastic in addition to being very comfortable. I don't generally write reviews, but wanted to leave one for others here because I definitely recommend these belts.I ended up purchasing the 30\"-34\" length (not realizing that there were even options, didn't see it at the time) even though I wear 36\" size pants. It worked out for the best though because with how I wear the belt, the prong goes through about 3\" from the end of the belt or so which leaves a shorter tail which I prefer. For anyone >36\" though definitely get the next length up at least.",

I had a different stretchy belt that I wore all the time and was more expensive but these are actually nicer looking and seem to be of good quality. If I ever start to tuck anything in I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to have these show. Ha ha, never gonna happen.Just a heads up, I\u2019m mostly a 32, sometimes a 33 if I\u2019m feeling large, and so I got the 30-34 size. It\u2019s definitely not huge but comfortable for me w a little slack if I needed to go tighter. If you\u2019re a true 33-34 you might consider the larger size. Just my opinion.",
