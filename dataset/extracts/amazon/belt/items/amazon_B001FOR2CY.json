                "reviewText": "5-8-17I've been looking for a replacement military style belt for a while now, however, I only searched brick & mortar stores. For some reason it never occurred to me to search Amazon and I shop here all the time. My father and I both wear Dickie work pants majority of the time and we both prefer the military style belts to use with them. The last 3 brands for belts I used were Dickies (lasted years), Wrangler (lasted years) & Faded Glory (only lasted months before the belt portion started fraying). This time around I couldn't find either of the former 2.My reason for purchasing Columbia belts (I bought 2; 1 Navy for myself, 1 Black for my father) was to try this brand out too. I have not used them before for belts and their price was quite fair compared to the higher end belts I've purchased before. The Columbia belts seem wider, but that's not an issue for me as long as they fit through the pant loops, which they do. I had to test them on my pants, since female clothes tend to be made smaller in every aspect. The cloth for the belts seem comparable to the higher end material too. Only time will tell how they old up. I do plan to do an update as I do on every review. The photos only reflect the Navy belt due to the fact I gave my father the Black one already.I bought this from the seller \"Amazon.com LLC\", which I feel is important to list this info. I've come across sellers with variances in their items, including knockoffs, even if listed as same brand.***UPDATE***12-25-17I've ordered 3 more belts last week, for myself and my father again. 1 Navy, 1 Black, & 1 Beige... not because our belts are worn, but to match with different gear. Once again I'm posting images of the Navy belt. This time around I have a side by side comparison from the one I purchased on April 21st, with the one ordered last week. There is only slight wear that is noticeable on the old belt, which can only be seen if the belt is off the pants. This is where the rear center pant loop is, so the loops has trained the belt to be slightly skewed there, not an issue. The only other difference is a slight fade in color, which in my field, is to be expected (see photos). My belt is exposed to both equipment and automotive greases, as well as construction or landscaping dirt, dust, and mud.I do wash my belt from time to time. I remove the buckle so that there's no banging while laundering. Funnily enough, I just noticed the cleaning tag on the belt which states to \"spot clean only\". Oh well, no problems laundering in the washing machine so far, which has been done at least 5 or 6 times since purchase. After I size my belt, I use a waterproof adhesive on the end I cut, then let it cure. This keeps the end from fraying and makes it easier to reinstall on the buckle. I'm thrilled with these belts. Everything about them screams \"quality and heavy duty\". I expect these to last many years.***UPDATE***6-19-19It's now been just over 2 years since original purchase. The belt itself has held up quite well, and I wear it almost daily... at least 5 out of 7 days a week, if not more. Finally, the bar broke last night :( The bar in the buckle which is what holds the belt taught. I'm disappointed as the rest of the belt is holding up quite well!! Yes, the color has faded a bit, but I'm not concerned since the belt is for my work pants. Now I've joined the club with many reviewers, who've encountered this same misfortune.I would truly like this defect corrected in the future, easily remedied by using a quality metal, but for now I won't purchase a replacement Columbia brand. Price has increased by a couple dollars since original purchase as well, furthur contributing to my decision. I'll look for a replacement buckle, but I tend to keep my older functional ones anyway. I've NEVER had this issue in any other brand, it's usually a lack of quality in the material of the belt and the premature wear or fraying, which causes me to replace them. Now if I could only find a company that can provide both quality material belt & buckles!!I've included my own updated photos as well.",

I wore the belt all day every single day, and it was my only belt.Overall, I really liked it. I love this style of adjuster and it fits my wardrobe perfectly. It did have some durability issues, like all of the reviews state.Mine failed differently than most I think, with the toothed bar that holds the belt in place becoming bent rather than snapping as is typical. It could be a different alloy/heat treat they're trying to alleviate the snapping issue. It caused the edges of the belt to start fraying, as that's the only point of contact now that the bar had become bent. Unfortunately as it has continued to fray it no longer holds tightly.Also the plating on the top, especially on the protruding part of the bar has been worn away / tarnished, and some corrosion has started on the inside of the buckle, but neither of those issues really bothered me. The webbing also has some memory to it after wearing it so long, although again thats really inconsequential.I'll most likely order again!",

Time has changed that.Value 5/5Reliability 2/5Web Belt Quality 5/5Buckle Quality 1/5SummaryIt appears like an awesome belt at first, and in some aspects it is, but it fails in reliability, with a cheap metal used for the tension device, which WILL bend or break in time.The Pros:The actual web belt part is thick and sturdy. It is of good quality. It was very long and I easily cut it to fit my needs.The Cons:Initially the buckle kept the belt tight, and was even tough to take off due to the amount of tension (easily solved by tightening the belt to leave enough slack to release tension). The problem was after some time the belt would loosen occasionally. No problem right? I would just tighten it every now and then. Unfortunately it became more and more common, requiring me to tighten my belt every time I sat down and stood up. Eventually the metal tension device did not stay back at all, and kept sliding back for a loose fit.After analyzing the belt I noticed over time the metal rolling tension device had bent, preventing tension from existing as the tensioner would slide right out since it was curved where the web belt is.I attempted to solve the problem, I though \"It is metal right, I can just bend it back.\". WRONG. It is actually a very cheap metal and broke in two when I attempted to bend it with a flat head screw driver. Another reviewer posted a picture of that same piece breaking on its own after normal use. If it were not for that cheap piece this would be an awesome product.",
