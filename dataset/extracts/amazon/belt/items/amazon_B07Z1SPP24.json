Just take out the screws one at a time a put a small drop of loctite on the screw or thread hole and retighten. It will never come loose again. I love how you can adjust the belt at very small increments unlike a traditional belt. Also the extra belt material slides behind instead of over the buckle so it doesn't flap around for a nice clean look. Material is thick and sturdy. I use it with my edc holster daily. Will be ordering a few more in different colors. Definitely recommend this over other nylon belts I have tried.",

                "reviewText": "Handsome, minimal packaging.Belt material looks and feels high quality.Ratcheting mechanism does feel a little flimsy, but works fine. Practice using the belt and don't force it and it should last long enough considering the price point. I have a feeling the reviewers posting pictures of broken belts were forcing them instead of being patient. It feels sturdy enough to me and offers positive locking into all positions.I have found that it is easier to release the ratchet by putting light pressure on the release lever then pushing the belt inwards slightly as though you are tightening it. That releases tension and allows easy removal.I've also found i prefer to press on the locking bar on the back of the buckle directly to release ratchet tension. I might actually grind off the little lever nub thing out of personal aesthetic preference and elimination of a snag point.At first i though the ratchet bar was going to be a comfort issue because it seems to stick out of the rear quite far. In fact, it seems to settle into the gap where the button on my Levis fasten quite nicely and acts as a locator tab, helping to keep the belt in place. It is not uncomfortable or annoying.I could live without the branding on the front and the fake belt loop thing on the buckle but it is an otherwise subtle and handsome looking belt and the black finish looks nice and durable.Overall a high quality product that has converted me to ratchet belts. I'll never buy a standard belt again. If it lasts more than a couple years this is an outstanding value.This is also an ideal belt solution for folks with a CCW license carrying on the waist in any position.But please, practice operation of the belt for a bit before wearing it because i almost pissed my pants cause i wasnt used to removing it yet -___-",

                "reviewText": "Belt works great! One little thing I don't like. The little loop for trapping the excess seems pointless and falls off easily. But unless you've ordered one way too big for you, it doesn't need it anyway. I just left it off and pretend it never existed. Very pleased with belt. Looks good, latches good. A little bit of getting use to finding the release quickly but now that I'm use to it I wouldn't want it any different. Regular belts are what feel weird and clunky to me now.Update: I've worn this belt almost every day for 10 months now and if it wasn't for a couple tiny scratches I manged to put on the buckle, it's just as good as new. No stretching, no fraying and no signs of the the mechanism wearing out. I really like the way it looks and once you get used to the latch it is so much quicker and easier to use than a standard buckle. I will never go back to leather belts. I keep belts pretty snug and I probably would have stretched out 2 leather ones by now in this same time. And by stretched I mean when I lay them flat, they try to form a U because my belly stretches the top side more than the bottom. This belt has zero curve and is absolutely deserving of a 5 star rating. I also don't hesitate to clip something like a tape measure to it where as I've scratched up leather belts severely by doing that.",

                "reviewText": "Ich bin 184cm gro\u00df und 92kg schwer, recht sportlich habe aber ein \"Lockdown-B\u00e4uchlein\". Im Sitzen misst mein Umfang am Bauchnabel 118cm :-) Daher habe ich den G\u00fcrtel in Gr\u00f6\u00dfe L bestellt. Dieser ist wie beschrieben 135cm lang, ich habe also tats\u00e4chlich 17cm die noch durch die verschiebbare Schlaufe als Reserve f\u00fcr \u00fcppige Familienfeste dienen.Das Produkt ist wie abgebildet, das Metall der Schnalle ist sehr wertig und angenehm schwer. Das offene Nylon Ende wurde ganz passabel verarbeitet, hier und \u00fcberhaupt steht nirgends ein Faden ab. Der G\u00fcrtel selbst ist exzellent gewebt und das schwarz \"echt\". Der Schlie\u00dfmechanismus \"ratscht\" angenehm aber nicht zu laut, ist \u00fcberraschend pr\u00e4zise und der Pin zum L\u00f6sen l\u00e4sst sich gut mit einer Hand am G\u00fcrtel bedienen. (Ich trage die Schnalle von mir ausgesehen links, der Pin ist also auf der Unterseite und kann mit dem linken Zeigefinger problemlos gelockert werden). F\u00fcr den Preis eine absolute Kaufempfehlung.Das ggf. schw\u00e4chste Glied an der Schnalle k\u00f6nnte meiner Erfahrung nach eines Tages der Lockerungspin sein. Sollte dieser aber 1-2 Jahre halten, kaufe ich mir auf jeden Fall diesen G\u00fcrtel erneut, denn der G\u00fcrtel sieht dem Urteil meiner Frau nach sehr gut aus und passt perfekt mit und zu jeder anprobierten Hose!",
