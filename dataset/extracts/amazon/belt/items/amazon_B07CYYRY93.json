After a little more than a month of use the buttons that hold the buckle are no longer staying snapped, very cheap. Timberland usually makes goods durable products so i chose to ask the seller was this product authentic. The seller assured me it was so i can now leave this review. The product is good leather but functionality of the belt is a mere 2. I would NOT recommend buying this product. You may have better luck but im completely unsatisfied because with no functionality it's useless to me!",

They get all bunches up or either hang over or come down below the belt at the back. This belt fixes all that. Great, great belt.",
