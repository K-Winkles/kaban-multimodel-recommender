                "reviewText": "Needed a yellow belt for an X-Men Cyclops costume. I bought the X logo belt buckle, slid the loop on the X buckle over the end of the belt so it caught on the silver metal buckle on the belt. Without putting it on, I then I buckled the yellow belt like you normally would, fastened it on the last belt hole, or largest waist size (so the end of the belt would not stick out). This allowed for a belt hole to be available for the X Buckle to hook into. Then, just expand the belt, step into it, and then tighten to fit. Perfect belt for costumes, just pull to expand the belt, or loosen and lower, practical bathroom accessibility is paramount in costume selection! lolWithout any cutting, sewing, or alteration - an awesome and affordable X-Men belt - Complete!Now, I just need to figure out how to make red contacts light up like LEDs, hmmm",
