Whenever we get these belts for my window cleaners they are always the first to go. The other belts that we have don\u2019t compare at all because the buckles are made out of plastic and the fabric material just isn\u2019t as nice.",

                "reviewText": "Great price. Takes longer to put on and take off than conventional buckles, but may be slightly faster to unbuckle for bathroom breaks, assuming it doesn't malfunction. Nice, if limited color choices. Unknown quality metals. Good webbing. Amenities are a nice touch. Packaged for store shelves, not warehouses or shipping.When I bought these the buckle was erroneously listed as plastic, because a different style belt by the same brand was being sold on the same page. They appear to have since fixed that. Unfortunately, currently there still isn't any intel regarding the materials used for the buckle, more importantly how resistant it is to the elements, namely water, dirt, and sand. We're left to wonder if this is truly tactical or just another product for people who think tactical is a fashion.It does appear well made. The nylon webbing is a bit thicker than the last few CQR belts I've bought. And the buckle's paint, while it's very presence is typically indicative of using a non-stainless metal, appears to be applied reasonably well. The stretch band is a good idea for people who don't want to cut the belt down to size. But, it's also easy to lose when you're in a hurry. However, the key chain hook feels very cheaply made, making one question the buckle's build more, and I would suspect that most people who carry their keys that way already have something to hook to their belt loop. So both amenities may prove ultimately pointless for most. Fortunately they don't seem to affect the price. Three belts for twenty bucks is a solid deal even for nylon, assuming the buckles don't corrode or jam easily. I've yet to need to put it to the test yet, myself. For all but military, some really dirty jobs, and coastal communities, I expect they'll be fine.Aside from offering a slightly thinner profile for those who need an inner belt, I'm not sure of the point of the design though. I had use for a blue leisure/light work belt, and bought these out of curiosity and largely because the price was right. I doubt I'd buy them again, but am not disappointed in the product so far.They do need to package the belts more appropriately for online distribution. The box they come in is more for show than for protection. It definitely isn't robust enough to survive warehousing or shipping in a thin plastic bag. It also isn't sealed, so if the lid comes off in a sorting bin or the box is torn open, it would be easy to lose parts.",

                "reviewText": "I like these for the price. They look good and feel like great quality. Wearing them for 2 weeks I was still having to tighten them every hour or so. As the description says it won\u2019t fit through some pant loops. Luckily they fit all my work pants with some effort. Only negative I have with these is these things are slightly bigger than my comfort ability needed for work. Hunching over or sometimes driving the buckle digs into your belly a bit. But if you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t do heavy work and sits on a nice chair all day with a different posture than a driver seat then this would be perfect. But overall love these. Highly recommend.",
