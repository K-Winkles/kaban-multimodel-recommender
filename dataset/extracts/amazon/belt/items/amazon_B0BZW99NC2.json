It uses a basic little plastic bit on one end fitting into and locking thru a hole in the receiving end. The belt itself isn\u2019t bad but nothing special, just basic nylon.So far, I\u2019m not impressed but for <$10 it what I expected. I\u2019ll give it a try and see how it works as a belt and worse case I\u2019ll just trash the buckle and use the nylon as a cheap tie strap.,,",
