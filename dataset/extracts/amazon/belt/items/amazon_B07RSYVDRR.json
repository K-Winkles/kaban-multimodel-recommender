                "reviewText": "First off. Well done! Build quality was much higher than expected! I originally bought this to replace my standard issue one from my place of work. They use a cheap knockoff of the red cap brand belt. If you go through radical weight gain and loss like I have because of factors in my life those cheap belts last maybe 3 months in orignal condition.Now on to this belt. Build quality is that of a belt at a much higher cost. Thick stitch and very nice finished leather. The stretch isn't too much and isn't too little.Did you stress eat a little to much at lunch? A okay this belt can handle you.Bloated from a poor choice diet?A okay this belt can handle you!Laying on a moving assembly line trying to desperately shoot a bolt while in someone else's pitch and worried you might break your belt or crossthread a hard to reach bolt?A okay this belt can handle you!Offline job? A okay this belt can handle you!Really this is one of the best purchases I've ever made for clothing. I'm extremely satisfied and am buying another in black for business attire.Enjoy! Stay hydrated and get plenty of sleep!",
