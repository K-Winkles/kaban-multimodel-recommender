I know that information doesn't help anyone make a decision but I'm required to wear a belt with my work clothes and I'm old and have to share Unisex Port-A-Johns with coworkers.One, I don't have time to mess with a belt . The open front is SO easy. It functions like a belt but isn't annoying like a big heavy leather bulky belt.Two, it satisfies my work requirement and when I'm in a port a John I don't have to hold some big heavy leather belt and buckle off the urine soaked flooring.I left my first one at work and someone stole it. So thank God I could still get the same belt.The elastic seems sturdy, I have mine adjusted with just a smidgen of tension. The belt is not super stretchy so it feels like the elastic will last. I like the antique brass hardware. Nothing that looks like it will chip off. Very subdued.This was a perfect answer to not wanting to wear a belt but being required to. Now I don't have to worry about being \"out of uniform\"",

The size I purchased is fine for my regular fitting jeans, but I have some that are a too large in the waist. I could use a little more cinch with those jeans, but I'm already at the smallest setting on the belt I purchased. I'm so excited about these belts, I have been telling all of my friends about them. It is really nice to not have the buckle bulge in the front. They hold my pants up just as well as a traditional belt, but much more comfortable.",
