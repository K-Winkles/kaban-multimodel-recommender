However, it eventually had issues with the holes expanding and nearly ripping (belt too tight, maybe). So, I'm hoping the softness of this belt doesn't translate to easier deformation/elongation of the holes. Time will tell.For the price, this belt seems worth the money spent. Definitely comfortable. Just a little worried about the durability.Disclaimer: I often review items I received at no cost for my honest, unbiased review.
