                "reviewText": "I bought one of these belts in 2016 from a LE Uniform store. What I liked was the thickness and strength. I was using it for a OWB holster, but also for dress and this belt fits the bill for both. When I was trying it on, my waist was a 36-38. The 36-38 was to small to I bumped up to a 40 (diet time). Fit was good. I've had the belt since 2016 and it still is fine, but starting to get a little stretched out. Went back to the same store and owner looked me up and said it was a Boston Belt. He only had 42 sizes. Took it off the rack and noticed it was smaller than my 40. I tried it on and it was smaller, only about 4\" after the buckle was secured. They said it was because my belt was stretched out. Their price was $40. While in the store, checked Amazon and saw it for $20. I left the store, when in my truck and ordered it. Came in the next day and noticed it was small. Confused, it's still in the package, deciding to return for a 44 (!!!). So this long winded review bottom line is, the belt runs small. Excellent quality and for the cost, I'd buy it again.",
