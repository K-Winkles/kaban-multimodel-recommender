I really appreciate the elastic band on it as well to hold the extra length of belt in place. I have used it multiple times now and it holds in place no matter what I've been doing. The other thing I really like is that it fits through my belt loops easily. I have tried other belts in the past and they are a pain to get through the loops (too wide or have a wide buckle). I'm very happy with this belt and recommend it to anyone looking for a good one.",

                "reviewText": "Combining the functionality of a tactical belt with the neatness of a shirt-tucker, the Shirt Stay Plus Tactical Belt promises to be a versatile companion for both duty and everyday wear. But can it truly deliver on both fronts? Let's buckle up and dive into this review, fellow tactical enthusiasts and fashion-conscious individuals!**First Impressions:**Made with durable 100% nylon webbing, this belt exudes a sense of sturdiness. The low-profile buckle is made of metal for added strength, while remaining snag-free and airport-friendly. The unique shirt-staying mechanism intrigued me \u2013 could it really keep my shirt tucked in throughout the day?**Tactical Prowess:**The belt holds its own in terms of functionality. It securely supports holsters, pouches, and other gear without sagging, making it ideal for police, military, and security personnel. The adjustable design allows for a customized fit, and the D-rings offer attachment points for additional equipment.**From Duty to Dinner:**But this belt isn't just for duty days. The sleek design and neutral color options make it suitable for everyday wear as well. The shirt-staying mechanism worked surprisingly well, keeping my shirt tucked in neatly throughout an entire day of errands and meetings. No more embarrassing untucking moments!**A Few Snags in the Webbing:**While the belt impressed overall, there were a couple of minor drawbacks. The nylon webbing, while durable, might feel a bit stiff compared to softer leather belts. Additionally, the shirt-staying mechanism might not be suitable for all types of shirts or body shapes.**The Verdict:**If you're looking for a versatile belt that offers both tactical functionality and a neat appearance, the Shirt Stay Plus Tactical Belt is a solid option. It's durable, adjustable, and surprisingly effective at keeping your shirt tucked in. However, if you prioritize ultimate comfort or a wider variety of color options, you might want to consider other belts. Remember, the perfect belt depends on your individual needs and preferences. Choose wisely, and may your shirt always stay put!",

The fabric is thick and durable and the metal components are solid and not flimsy.I found that the belt has a low profile and is comfortable around the waist, even when doing strenuous activity.Given the $15 price range, I think that this belt is fairly priced and a great value. I highly recommend this belt.",
