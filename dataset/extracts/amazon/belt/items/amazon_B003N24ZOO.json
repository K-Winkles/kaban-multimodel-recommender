Good value purchase. I got it to use on a couple jeans that stretch out too much and start falling down after the first day of wear so I only wore them for yard and house work. But now I also wear them in town with this belt because it looks nice casual. This belt works equally well for men and women.",

From this point on, here's the new agenda\u2026. if it works as advertised, is well made, meets or exceeds the description, is a value, and arrives in a fair amount of time, it will get a \"star rating\" equal to what my expectations were/are. If it doesn't meet these criteria, then I will most definitely and descriptively tell the short comings of the products and you as a consumer will not have to go through the trouble of buying the product without some background knowledge. If the sell pulls that item and relists under another description, I will put the exact same review on the seller's feedback page. Sellers have done this a couple of times in the past, and I was true to my word then as well as now. DR",
