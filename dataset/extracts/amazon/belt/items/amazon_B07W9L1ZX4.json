My only complaint (very small), the ends of the belt don't fit through most of my belt loops so, I have to take the one end off just about every time. That said, if i use it for work and have a lot of things on my belt (cell, Gerber, tape measure), it doesn't pull through when I unbuckle.",

I was impressed with it so I found belts for myself that have the simplified buckle. the buckle only matters for \"off\". I need to undo the belt from the buckle and thread the belt through the loops and then adjust for fit. which is pretty great. leather belts have fixed holes so you don't get exact comfort. it can be a bit tight or a bit loose. neither is good if you are carrying.I typically have a 4\" blade camel bone skinner horizontal over my left pocket. a 238 at 3 O'clock, and a snacky bag full of treats when I play with my puppy. no sagging yet. this belt is a bit more thin than the leather so I am not overly confident in the IWB style clip on my holster.",
