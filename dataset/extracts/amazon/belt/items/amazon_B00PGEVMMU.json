After looking through dozens of sites, this is the beefiest one I could find.This is a very manly belt, for work no murse packers or yuppies need to apply.This is heavy thick oiled course cut cowhide, solid brass hardware with welded loop (not bent wire), and quad riveted together. This thing will last a long time, and has gotten to be very comfortable with break in to be so thick, yet it holds my pants up with all my work essentials (wrenches pliers ratchets etc) crammed in the thigh pockets.The only drawback is most pants dont have 2\" belt loops,and with the thickness of the strap it just wont fit.This was an easy fix though.I cut 5/16\" off the full width and know I can even wear it with my jeans.Great product good price point, great service, and a must have for the working man.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for an IWB carry belt that didn't buckle or lose shape when carrying my xD or G23. This thing is super great, and so much cheaper than belts advertised for IWB. There are a couple of problems- the belt is lether but not polished leather, the back of it has an unfinished feel to it. If it gets wet, I'm assuming your pants could get stained. The biggest issue is that this thing is HUGE. I guess I didn't know what 2\" meant, but, this takes up all of the loop and flat out won't fit in some pants. I haven't had a problem with my jeans, but, you can't wear this belt with dress pants. That's the biggest limitation. For the price, it's unbeatable. Your tool doesn't move, it feels super secure. The belt is lightweight and distributes the load over a huge surface area, thus- no give. It's awesome. I bought two, and if I needed more, I'd buy them in a heartbeat.",

                "reviewText": "It is, indeed, a sad commentary when one feels compelled to praise a manufacturer and/or vendor for that which was once taken for granted as commonplace, yet such is the case. The belt--in all of its simplicity--is well made; will, I believe, last for decades; and, in truth, exceeds my expectations. A work belt, however, it fits the loops on my jeans and is far more comfortable than the narrow belts which have long been in vogue. I was impressed to the point that I placed a followup order for additional belts. If there exist any negatives, I have yet to discover them. In summary, it is wide, it is comfortable, functional, and practical. it is a simple, plain, and,to me, an attractive belt that I would not hesitate to recommend. Finally, I commend Amazon for their fast delivery and professional service throughout this transaction.",

                "reviewText": "This belt is well made. Heavy duty leather. I cannot imagine it ever wearing out or falling apart..I wear a 30\" pant, and Im able to cinch this belt down with holes to spare. I think this belt could work for anyone 28\" and up. I trimmed about 9 inches off mine, and it is about the perfect size for me. It is basically just a flat strap of leather with holes punched in it, so trimming it doesn't require more than a good, sharp knife. I got it primarily to use as a belt to support a revolver and cantine when I go out into the wilderness. It supports that weight just fine. The wide belt distributes the weight evenly, rather than digging in and sagging like a narrow/thin belt. I don't think you could find a better belt for the price.",

                "reviewText": "All the available holes mean that the waist size is very adjustable. I have checked to see very closely if the belt color or dye \"bleeds\" onto pants or shirts. So far, it hasn't. Belt is nice and thick. Perfect at 2\" wide for utility pants and jeans since most of them have wide belt loops. Won't work on dress or casual pants since most of them are around 1.5\" to 1.75\". With this belt it stops the waist from rolling or curling over. The finish isn't great, nothing fancy. The buckle is pretty cheap looking as well. My complaint with this and a lot of other belt brands is that they rivet or tack weld the end of the belt onto the belt buckle and loop. You can't make any adjustments or change out the buckle unless you use a mini saw and pry tool. The loop is too close to the buckle.",
