Are they TSA approved? Yes, they are subject to setting off metal detectors and are not TSA approved. We advise you to remove your belt and wallet before going through the metal detector. How can I clean or care for my Groove Belt? Mild soap and warm water are all you need for cleaning! We recommend cleaning after a fair amount of wearing just to be sure dirt doesn\u2019t hang around. For the belt, a stain remover pen has also been known to do the trick. What size Groove Belt should I order? Match the belt size you order to your pant size! If you're at the high end or on the cusp of a size, we recommend sticking with the size down. For example, if you're right at 36\" or right at 37\", we'd recommend ordering a medium.",

This belt is truly remarkable because it\u2019s adjustable but firm and does its job very well. The magnetic buckle is perfect in every way. The belt flexes just enough when you sit down but stays in place very well. If you\u2019re a big guy like me and have belly overhang, it doesn\u2019t dig in to you. Even after long periods of sitting. It\u2019s a really amazing belt all the way around. Just buy it!!",

                "reviewText": "Review for Groove Life Belt on Amazon:\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50I came across the Groove Life belt thanks to a recommendation from Sleeperdude on YouTube, and I must say, it lives up to the hype. The quality and design are impressive, making it stand out from other belts I've owned recently. However, a pro-tip for potential buyers: you can actually snag it at a more affordable price directly from the Groove Life website using the discount code SLEEPERDUDE. Yes, that's S-L-E-E-P-P-E-R-D-U-D-E, all in one word. While it might be on the pricier side, the belt's durability and comfort make it worth every penny. Highly recommend giving it a try!",

However if hole 2 feels tight and 3 feels too loose you're kinda out of luck.2.) Belts without holes. These belts are good for the fact that you can adjust them to any length, but have the downside of it's at a slightly different length almost every day.This belt is set and forget, you will always have the same length every day, but you can adjust it to any length! Not to mention it takes a half of a second to clip it into place. Been wearing to work with a physically active job, it has never gone loose and the clip has never gone undone.Not to mention it's quite stylish too.",
