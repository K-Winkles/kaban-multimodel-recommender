I had read other reviews about premature wear, and I've had lots of experience with that with other belts, so I was a bit reluctant at first, but the price point was just right so I took a chance.it's been a couple of months and it gets used at least once a week, and I have not had a problem with wear on the belt itself. the buckle is fine and the paint if not wearing off yet (also a problem for cheaper belts). Overall satisfied, and while it's not the nicest belt ever, I gave the 5 stars based on price point and corresponding quality.",

                "reviewText": "Great belt with fine conservative-looking colors and semi glossy finish, however be warned that the belt will wrinkle near the designated insertion hole over time due to the lack of material support close to the belt holes. So if you want to wear this for a formal office work environment, I recommend that this brand model is not the one you want to wear to show your colleagues or supervisors. Wrinkles will develop and as wrinkles develop, some people will judge you by the look of your belt.My opinions on the style recommendations...the brown side of the belt looks great on blue jeans. The black side of the belt looks great on khakis and other similar pants.Is not truly real leather, more like synthetic leather. For the affordable price, why complain if its not real leather.Want real leather, find another premium brand that cost more.I was lenient in giving this product a 5 star since I bought this belt as an everyday-use belt rather than a formal-use or office-work belt.",

                "reviewText": "If you're like me and most other people, you're on a quest to find a decently priced belt while praying and hoping that it will last you a pretty good time. Is this belt it? Sad to say it but I don't think so. The cheap material is already fraying and rubbing off after a couple months of usage. It's not fraying horribly bad to the point where I'm ashamed of wearing it but still, I'm already deciding on how I should proceed in my next belt purchasing decision. This belt is a bit skinny but it's just something that you'll get used to eventually. I know I did.I bought size 32. I'm 5'8 and about 140lbs. At the moment, I click in at hole number 4 for that perfect fit. The reversible buckle is very nice but I have to say, the brown is a tad darker than what I would like it to be.",

The stretch feature is great for comfort all day, and I like the reversible feature, which make the belt valuable to those who want to conserve closet space.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice weight - not too thin, not too heavy. It fits through the loops of dress pants with a bit of space to spare, which is nice. It's double-sided, brown on one side and black on the other. The buckle swivels easily by pulling it out and twisting. Dad can do this easily, which is great. It's very nice looking and seems to be a good quality also.Very happy with this belt.",
