I tried this, liked the brand and could see it in the local store. A good price here, so I ordered a size above mine which I normally do. Well it was a bit big and hand to stamp more holes in it! Then I ordered it a size smaller and perfection. I have had it over 3 months now, no tears, no crumpling, no \"leather\" flaking off. It is a bit wide, (I like), but is thick and fits perfect. Great quality. Is it for a Tuxedo? no... but I use it every day. If it ever wears out, I will buy it again.",
