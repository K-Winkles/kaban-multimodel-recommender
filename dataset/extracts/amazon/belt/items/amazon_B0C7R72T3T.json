                "reviewText": "The SANSTHS men's belt is truly a great belt. I have only used it for two days and just ordered one more. I have been using Mission bets for several years now, but lately have had them come apart while wearing. I have had the clamp on the buckle fail and next thing my pants are almost dropping to my knees. The SANSTHS belt stays where you place the tension. When you sit down, it stretches which provides more comfort then strangling you gut, which an inflexible type of belt does. When I ordered this belt, i had some concerns if it would work as shown by staying where you clamp it down and the answer so far is a resounding YES. The design of the buckle is brilliant, the stretch material of the belt is top notch and so far it is working better then expected.Since I just ordered another after only two days, I would say that alone is a solid endorsement of recommendation. I will likely buy more of their belts, hopefully when on sale. I like the ratchet belt with the American flag and plan to buy in the future.If anything changes, I will update this review. So far, very impressed.",
