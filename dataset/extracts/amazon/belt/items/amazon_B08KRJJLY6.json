This product does everything a belt can without irritating the skin - holding your pants up and making you feel like you're wearing the pants and not it wearing you. The only thing it does not serve is aesthetics but rashes do not fit aesthetics either.Highly recommend! Make sure you follow the measuring guides as well.",

                "reviewText": "So far these are more comfortable than a belt, but still a little loose for my preference.Essentially, this is a piece of elastic that is sandwiched into some velco. You use the velco to loop around the belt loops to station it in place, and the center of it is \"flexible\", making it feel like you are wearing sweatpants instead of dress pants, shorts, or jeans.I'm a big guy (6'5\" at size 58), so I've gone through a couple of iterations of getting these \"tight\" since I got the pair of Beltbros yesterday.It doesn't help that my shorts have elastic \"expansion\" on the sides for lose/comfort fit (just in front of the pockets on either side), so I'm using velcro and more elastic to reign in the original elastic.I had to go to 3 loops (so the ends skip the middle loop) to get it to feel like my pants weren't going to wardrobe malfunction to the ground unexpectantly, but I fear this will greatly reduce the longevity of this product as the elastic will likely wear out much faster being stretched out to the point it doesn't want to stretch further. This is only day 2, so we'll see (I've got an emergency belt ready for the day the music dies).",

                "reviewText": "Due to a hunting accident years ago that left my husband disabled and he only has the use of his pinky on his left hNd and he has full use of his right hand, and he has a hard time with certain belts and he would get frustrated at times. I ran across these and he started using them the day they came in the mail and loves them. The material is sturdy and he likes that he can lose it or tighten it and it's simple for him. He does Manuel labor and these help keep his pants up and my only mistake is not buying them in multiple colors but they're reasonably priced so we will purchase more.",
