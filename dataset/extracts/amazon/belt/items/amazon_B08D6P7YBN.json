                "reviewText": "I have been wearing, or trying to wear, regular leather belts for some time. This belt solved all three of my problems. What where those problems?1. Holes in leather belts stretch/wear out. This may be due to them using lousy, or fake, leather, but it undermines the usefulness of the belt.2. Holes are \"never\" in the right place for my waist size, so they where always too loose, or too tight.3. I have to wear specific style/color of pant's/shorts for work and, especially during Covid, trying to freaking \"find\" a new pair, when they wore out, which was the right type (cargo) and color... was almost impossible. This meant buying from multiple brands. Why was that a problem? Because some brands are bloody pains and make their belt loops so tight fitting that you cannot actually \"get\" the end of a belt to pass through more than once - in my case this meant that those lovely \"leather\" belts where actually 6 inches too long to \"fit\" and not have a whole section of the belt flopping around, uncontained, if the retainer loop shifter (or, like the holes, just eventually wore out).The last one of those issues was the biggest problem for me. What good is a belt that won't stay bloody on, because it won't \"fit\" through the loops on the pants, and a large part of it is just dangling around in the air? Of the three issues this was the one I couldn't live with.This Ratchet style belt is thin enough, however, that even if it wasn't a bit shorter than the leather one (which if I got it short enough wouldn't have had holes that worked for me anyway), is thin enough to fit through the loops on the pants more than once - problem solved.Now.. if we could only get freaking clothes manufacturers to stop making the loops that tight in the first place, or making \"phone pockets\" that are soo freaking small you can't safely put a larger, modern, phone in them, or several other bloody stupid things they keep randomly doing, from one company to the next... but, that would be wishful thinking. lol",

He says the ratchet belt is now his favorite. 5/5 stars, Highly recommend!",

It does exactly what they said it would do, made of good materials and can be adjusted to fit perfectly. I also bought another belt from this company before I knew about this issue that is more for business attire. The problem I found is that wearing it over a two week period that the back of the metal buckle rubs on the fabric and creates a hole in the fabric on every pair of shorts or pants I wear it with. I like the belt and would want to keep it but now it's useless. If I would\u2019ve known, I would\u2019ve returned it only for that reason but I\u2019m past the return date on both of them. I\u2019m hoping that the manufacturer will see this review and figure out a way to incorporate a softer material like leather or something for the back of the buckle so that it doesn\u2019t destroy or wear holes in the fabric.",
