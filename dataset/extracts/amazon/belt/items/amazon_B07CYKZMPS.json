                "reviewText": "[REVISED]As you'll read in my original review, I really liked this belt & believed that it was top quality, but I was dead wrong! In under a year, the material around the buckle frayed & it's no longer functional. It had minimal use, never for work, it wasn't tight at all, it was always worn relaxed in the 2nd or 3rd hole & I even ordered 2 sizes up based on other reviews. So, who knows? It's a shame because I really liked it. [REVISED][ORIGINAL REVIEW] Great versatile belt to wear with jeans but nice enough to wear with slacks. It's fatter width than a dress belt without being bulky. Very sleek & not one of those reversible belts with a buckle that comes off if it's too tight & you try sitting down. It's a stationary rock solid low-pro brushed nickel buckle with smooth high grade leather that has a masculine appeal. Don't let the brand name fool you either, because this is anything but a \"work\" belt, even though it appears to be durable enough to be one. You can wear it on a Saturday night & nobody can see the logo on it unless they get close enough & I'd imagine that if someone got that close, the belt won't be the deal-breaker. LoL I like it for traveling because it's the only belt that I need to pack regardless of attire. The only negatives are that the brown is very dark. Almost black. For you 40+, think of Fonzi's jacket. So not much contrast on the color. Also, as per other reviews, I do recommend going up 2 sizes from your pant-size (i.e. - I wear a 36 jeans, so I ordered a 40 belt & I'm glad that I did). To me, neither of those issues were a deal breaker & other than that, it's a great product that appears to be made from top quality materials & I highly recommend it.",
