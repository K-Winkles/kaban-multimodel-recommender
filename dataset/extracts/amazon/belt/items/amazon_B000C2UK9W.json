I ended up installing my old belt to make the car function normally. My window has closed for the return on April 8,2021.I am out $65 plus tax that I paid here on amazon. A complete rip off. Do not buy this belt for a toyota matrix, corolla or pontiac vibe. I will still file a complaint with amazon.",
