The belt seem sturdy, is tightly woven and has minimal stretch, but enough, and expect it won't stretch too much with wearing. We purchased a Greg Norman similar belt at the same time, which we are returning it. It is not as attractive, has brown trim (prefer black) with the black/grey color, and not tightly woven. I don't think it is worth twice the price. I suppose you pay for the shark logo. If Fairwin doesn't hold up as expected, I will try to revise this review. We are very please with it.",

                "reviewText": "When I was looking for a khaki colored elastic belt it would have been helpful to have pictures showing the true color since the color name from the sellers is mostly meaningless. So, after I purchased these belts, I wanted to share pictures in hopes it will help others with their decision. As you can see, I am a fan of these belts. They are a little bit wider than other belts I've purchased and I like that. Wider fills the belt loops better and looks better, IMO. I've had the blue and black belts for a couple of years now with no performance issues at all. Good luck with your search, and trying to decipher what is actually \"true\" product feedback. Pictures are worth a thousand words. Hope this review helps you!",

I've been very satisfied with the quality, feeling, looks and performance of this belt with no \"showing\" of wear vs previous belts that show the wear using the same hole over and over and wearing out. There is none of that \"wear\" with this belt. Since I've lost some weight I now am trying the next size shorter length belt and will be ordering additional ones in that size as well.",

Wasn\u2019t too sure about it but able to stretch it slightly to buckle. Worn several times and seems to work well, but is still very stiff and barely actually stretches. Not sure how I feel about it, good because it keeps it\u2019s shape, wondering if it will loosen in time. Bad because it\u2019s so very stiff, and I\u2019m used to these kind of belts being a bit more elastic.",

It is certainly quite heavy & a bit wide for me, an average size woman. I think it is too heavy for a smaller woman or a junior. I can barely get it through the belt loop on my jeans and certainly not fit the loose end back through a loop after closing it. It is also so heavy & tightly woven that you can barely get any stretch out of it. Very chunky & heavy for women's fashion.",
