                "reviewText": "Purchased a size 56 belt (54 inch waste) in black. Belt is approximately 63.5 inches long overall. As shown in the photos, the buckle holes begin about 53.5 inches from the buckle end and continue every inch thereafter ending at 59.5 inches (7 total holes). If I had to do it again I would have purchased one size smaller as on my 54 waste I am using the last hole rather than the more ideal situation of being in the middle of the selection. If I lose any weight (hope springs eternal) I have no place to go and would have to add a hole. This would then make the \"tail\" of the belt unusually long. The belt itself is not adjustable as the buckle is sewn in.Overall, though, I am pleased with the purchase. As a corpulent gent, finding reasonably priced dress belts that fit can be a challenge. Nice, conservative styling for both buckle and belt. Have only worn it twice so impossible to evaluate durability/longevity but upon initial inspection the stitching appears solid and the finish on the leather looks to be flexible enough to avoid wrinkling/cracking prematurely.I wear a dress belt for work 5 days per week. I will update this review in the future to include my experience with its durability over time. For now, based upon fit and initial appearance, it gets a five star rating from me. Represents a good value in a wide selection of sizes and colors.",
