                "reviewText": "I bought my first two Jasgood belts in August of 2018, a black one and a brown one. I wear the black one nearly every day and have since I bought it. When they came, they each came with a second buckle (they are plastic or Nylon) with a sticker that said \"Gift\" on them and I thought, \"Great, these are so cheap, they probably break in a week.\" Nope. I've never needed them.I've also never needed to buy a replacement and only recently bought another Jasgood belt because I wanted a different color. I will soon add three photos, of the buckle, the middle back where leather belts tend to get bend and wear badly (the Jasgood is barely flexed there) and the tip of the belt. I wear this belt 3+ days a week and have since I bought it in 2018.Buy a longer length than you need because you can cut it down to fit and if you buy it too short you will have to return it or give it to someone smaller than you. They are infinitely adjustable, so you could leave it long and just have a long \"tongue\" hanging out of the buckle if you thought you were going to get bigger (say if it was only a little large and it was for a growing child, for example).They come with an elastic loop to retain the belt tip also, but you can actually leave this off and just use a loop of the pants you are wearing if you prefer. I cannot recommend these belts highly enough for durability and comfort. They are extremely light and strong. You won't even know you're wearing it. There are many brands that look similar, but I can't speak for them, I have only bought, and will only ever buy, JASGOOD.",

You cant push it through the loops from a few inches away, you have to control the end the whole way through loops.Pay attention where it goes through the buckle. The first time I wasnt paying attention and didn't put it in the correct slot, and it was very difficult to remove!I like it. It's very functional, and strong, and looks good enough look to be an outer belt in most occasions. I might go for a thicker one if I need another for sturdiness.",

The belts material is made well and is holding up well also. It came with 2 buckles and I\u2019m assuming they sent 2 because of issues with the quality. It is a thin plastic. It had not failed yet (and it may never, I really don\u2019t know) but every time I wear this belt I\u2019m fearful the buckle will fail at some point during the day. I don\u2019t wear the belt everyday but I\u2019d say I wear it at least 1-2 a week. I only gave the three star because of the quality of the buckle. Had the quality of the buckle been better definitely would have given higher review and would have purchased more colors",

There are three reasons why this belt is better than the name brand. This belt's webbing is a sturdy gage, a heavier gage than the name brand which gives better waist control on your pants. The tip of the this belt is slightly tapered which makes it easier to thread through the belt loops on your pants, The end of the belt on the name brand product is not tapered which makes it difficult to thread through belt loops.. Lastly, this belt itself contains an adjustable , elasticized loop that allows you to tuck in the end of your belt for a clean and tidy appearance. No such loop on the name brand which means the end of your belt just hangs loose. Do yourself a favour. Buy this belt, not the name brand one. It is a better belt at a better price.",
