                "reviewText": "I previously used fabric adjustable belts, several were from Nike that had a nice buckle with good fabric and colors that were my favorite. I then got gifted a Dickies ratchet belt, similar to this one, and I rarely went back to the fabric ones as these look and function much better. The Dickies belt did wear out sooner than expected, and it also had a design flaw in that one of the pins that holds the buckle assembly together could loosen and fall out.Nevertheless, I was happy enough with it to go online and search for another one when I found these. These looked better, with lots of variations and were much cheaper as well so I ordered this one as a test. Now that I've had a chance to try it for a few weeks, I'll have no further hesitation in ordering more! The buckle is very nice and seems sturdier than the Dickies one. I haven't been able to find a similar flaw in it either, though time will tell as it took a long time before the other one broke. The ratchet release is in the opposite direction but as far as I can tell, that doesn't make any difference in function or quality.The quality of the belt seems comparable, if not better. If it shows wear too early I'll come back and update this, but so far it is holding up well. I'm definitely going to order a few more buckle/belt variations and I would recommend these to anyone buying a belt. If you haven't had one of these adjustable belts before, they are a total game-changer. No more having to go to the closest hole for the belt buckle even if it's slightly too loose/tight. Adjusting the belt in public is barely even noticeable to others, so no more embarrassing post-lunch maneuverings as you unbuckle, adjust, and buckle again, or for when you're at a concert or walking in the heat and need to tighten. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "There is a lot to like about this belt. It's durable, the belt has a smooth, supple feel to it (although, like most leather products, it's actually a bit stiff out of the box) and the buckle is very stylish. Like all new leather products, it has some new leather odor to it, but I found this fairly faint, and it will probably fade away over time.The belt comes in a box that's fancy enough to pass for a gift box, which is nice to know if you want to give this belt as a gift. The belt and buckle are packed separately in the box, so you'll need to put them together. This is simple enough to do, and no tools are required. Just release the clawed clamp on the left side of the buckle under the retaining band, slip the flat end of the belt into the clamp and close the clamp all the way.My belt was actually about six inches longer than the advertised 38 inches, so the ratchet track engaged too late and didn't let me tighten the belt enough when I first put it together. But that's no problem. Just grab a good pair of scissors, cut off the unnecessary inches from the end of the belt that attaches to the buckle (NOT the tapered end!), reattach the buckle and check the fit again. If you aren't good at measuring or estimating, then do this a little bit at a time until you achieve a good fit.Fastening the belt takes a little getting used to. The retaining band is part of an articulated metal piece attached to the buckle (the retaining band is on top, and the aforementioned clamp is on the bottom), and there isn't much room between that and where the end of the belt emerges as you feed it through the buckle. This makes it quite difficult to fully fasten the belt and then feed the extra belt length through the retaining band. So, instead, you'll want to carefully feed the end of the belt through the buckle so it passes immediately through the retaining band as well, then tighten the belt and feed the excess through the nearest belt loop on your pants.The one bugaboo this belt has is with taking it off. The release lever for the ratchet is small lever that's less than 1/4\" wide and no more than 1/2\" long. The way I wear my belt, starting at the first belt loop left of center and passing it through the loops around my back and coming back to center from my right, that lever ends up under the lower right corner of the belt buckle. I find it awkward to reach and operate, and men with larger hands may find it even more difficult. Its small size also means it doesn't offer much leverage, so it tends to be hard to turn once you've figured out which direction to turn it. What works best for me is to grasp the buckle with my right thumb and forefinger, twist the bottom of the buckle outward, then wedge my left thumbnail against the pivot (about half an inch towards center from the right edge of the buckle) and use my left forefinger to push the free end of the lever (even with the right edge of the buckle) outward to release the ratchet pawl. I sometimes also have to push the belt a bit further into the buckle from the right in order to relieve some tension on the pawl in order to move the release lever. I subtracted a star from this otherwise excellent belt for having such a fiddly release mechanism. Hopefully, I will find it easier to use with time; as of this writing, I've had the belt for just under a week.",
