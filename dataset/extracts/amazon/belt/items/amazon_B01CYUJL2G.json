                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A well-built item sold for a fair price.",
                "reviewText": "The company has a range of styles and colors of belt/buckle combinations to choose from (They actually sell a bunch of men\u2019s and women\u2019s accessories and gifts, but I\u2019m only reviewing the belt I bought). For the money, it seemed like a reasonable purchase, but I was unsure about the ratchet mechanism for the belt. This item arrived quickly after I ordered it and I had no issues at all with the shipping or delivery.The packaging of this item promised high quality. The company could easily have just wrapped the belt up in a rubber band or a cheap twisty tie, thrown the buckle in a plastic bag then dumped the whole thing in a nondescript box filled with packing peanuts and sent it on its way. Instead, the packaging was, well, kind of elegant. The cardboard box was decorated inside and out with a tasteful nautical theme. The belt, buckle, and even the bonus key chain were all secured in hard, smooth styrofoam organizer fittings inside the box that kept them secure in transit but also gave a presentation that was simple but also made me feel like I had been given a to-go box from the haberdashery in the Kingsman movie. I\u2019m kind of old-fashioned and I like a company that goes the extra mile for things like this. To me, it speaks to the company\u2019s commitment to excellence, not just for the product, but for every aspect of the consumer experience. So, from ordering to opening, high marks all around.Delving inside the box I was impressed with the quality of the items. The buckle was made from sturdy metal and the pattern on the face of it demonstrated quality craftsmanship. The belt itself was real leather too with subdued but hearty stitching around the edges and also anchoring the belt\u2019s half of the LiNXX\u2122 ratcheting mechanism. Both looked just as good as the pictures online.The buckle and belt need to be assembled before being worn, so it could be adjusted to the waist size of the wearer. The company tries to make this process as painless as possible by putting size reference markers on the inside of the belt, clearly showing where someone should cut (The belt I bought had markers from 30 inches up to 44 inches). I had to get a heavy duty set of cutting shears for this job because, as I said, this material is tough. That being said, I appreciated that the belt did not flake or crumble during the cutting process, which would indicate a poor material. Some other belts I\u2019ve purchased in the past that also said they were made with \u201cgenuine leather\u201d were poorly made leather/plastic hybrids that just cracked and peel from normal use after as little as a few weeks. This material stood up to being cut directly into it and either side of the cut looked just as out of the box perfect as before I cut it. All that being said, it made the next step a little tricky.Once the belt had been cut to the appropriate length, it had to be inserted into the buckle and attached via a spiked pedal that had to be pressed firmly to push the spikes into the leather of the belt. The pedal has to become flush with the rear side of the buckle in order for the spikes to completely penetrate the leather, for the belt to be worn comfortably, and so the belt will be completely secured to the buckle. Like most men, I fall squarely between the extremes of \u201cmanly man\u201d and \u201cwimp\u201d, and pushing the pedal\u2019s spikes through the leather belt is hard to do, especially without scratching up the front part of the buckle. I found it helpful to wear some workman\u2019s gloves to add some extra purchasing leverage for my hands. Once I got the spikes fully seated, I was convinced the belt wouldn\u2019t fall apart while holding up my pants.The LiNXX\u2122 mechanism for the buckle that ratchets the desired tightness of the belt onto the wearer seems to work as promised. Inside the belt, there is a plastic strip sewn into the leather that\u2019s approximately 6 inches long and 1/3 of an inch wide. The strip has a series of wedges on it that friction lock against a clip on the buckle which creates the ratcheting mechanism that enables the belt to not need holes in it. Upon first trying it, I was a little apprehensive. I have a concealed weapon permit and sometimes I carry a firearm with me. I was concerned that LiNXX\u2122 wouldn\u2019t be robust enough to support the weight of a firearm, but it locks in very securely and I have no issues carrying the extra weight on my hip. My only concern so far is that the buckler can be a little sensitive to unlocking. So far, I have had two occasions where I was adjusting the waistband of my pants and the mechanism unlocked, loosening my waistband for a moment. It locked into place on the next notch and my pants were never at risk of falling down, it was just surprising. This has only happened when I was adjusting my waistband near the buckle, and never when just casually moving around or bumping into things. So, it seems that as long as I only put my hand on the buckle when I intend to loosen my pants, there isn\u2019t an issue.This isn\u2019t necessarily a knock against the belt, it just makes me concerned about long term wear on this mechanism. I\u2019ve got an old school belt, the kind with holes notched into it, that I\u2019ve had for almost 20 years now and it still works great. The only reason why I needed to replace it was that the buckle has become (out)dated, or so it has been explained to me. I just wonder if the mechanism on the Mio Marino belt will endure as well as my former belt. After I\u2019ve worn the belt for a while, I\u2019ll provide an updated review in regard to its endurance.The belt also came with a leather key chain set that appears to be made with the same high-quality materials and workmanship as the belt and buckle. It\u2019s essentially a 2-inch leather strap with 3 small snap clip hooks on one end for keys and a larger snap clip hook on the other to attach to a belt loop. While I didn\u2019t need this item, it was a nice bonus and I can include reviews of this item later if anything noteworthy is observed.I can\u2019t speak directly to the company\u2019s customer service yet. They reached out to me by email to see if I had any questions, problems, suggestions, or concerns with my purchase and encouraged me to write a review for the product. It seemed like a form letter but it\u2019s still encouraging to see a business actively seeking feedback.Overall, the product seems to be a well-built item sold for a fair price by a company that takes itself and its prospective customers seriously. Before, I was skeptical but curious. But since I had such a positive buying experience, now I think I\u2019ll be going back for another belt in a different color.",

                "reviewText": "There are quite a few ratchet belt candidates out there, but I decided to try my first Marino back in July 2016 after some poor results from a ratchet belt from another manufacturer. Each Marino belt comes in a very elegant box, which is perfect for gifting. I am selfish and bought them solely for myself. Since I am unwilling to share my belts, I will share my humble opinion insteadThe review I am writing today is for my third Marino purchase, bought in October 2018. That in itself should be an indication of my opinion of this product. Each belt I have purchased has been a different style (in both belt and buckle) and each continues to serve me well.I use these belts with everything: shorts, jeans, khakis, and dress pants. In particular, it\u2019s very important for me to maximize comfort during formal events because, typically, most of my attire is built for appearance rather than comfort. Having a comfortable belt during these uncomfortable situations is a must. The Marino fits that requirement precisely.The belt buckle, once secured properly, stays in place and does not become loose, but is not difficult to remove if you need to trim down the belt or switch out the buckle itself. Having the belt buckle come loose during your day-to-day is the last thing you want. I have experienced this with other ratchet belts and it is infuriating, especially when the buckle falls off during an inconvenient time, such as while in a public restroom\u2026 into the urinal. But let us not dwell on the horrors of the past and, instead, look to the future. Marinos are the go-to for ratchet belts because they're durable, they look fantastic, and they have an excellent price especially given their exceptional quality.So why a ratchet belt over a traditional belt? In general, a ratchet belt allows for the perfect fit with the ability to make smaller incremental adjustments. This is very helpful if want to quickly and easily adjust your comfort level during the day, if you\u2019re focusing on weight loss, or need to adjust the belt after eating 5 lbs of bacon and cheese during a very dark period in your life. I also find that a ratchet belt has a much smoother on/off process and less degradation in the leather itself as a result of the tightening/loosening process.I highly recommend a ratchet belt and, to fulfill that need, I highly recommend the Marino.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this belt over 3.5 years ago and love its look, design and functionality. The ratcheting mechanism works well and allows for fine tuning when my waist expands after big meals, making the fit perfect all the time. This great functionality does not compromise the sleek look of the belt, nor the elegance of the buckle. A month ago, the leather strap split. I notified customer support and the next day I got an email asking me to confirm my address. A week later, I got a replacement strap. All my future belts will be Mio Marinos.****updated on 8/4/23***.I recently purchased another one of these belts and the ratchet mechanism would slip too easily when bumped. I returned it for an exchange and promptly got the replacement. It also slipped so I just returned it for a refund. I then ordered a different style and found the ratchet slipped too, but not quite as badly as the others, so I kept that one. Seems that quality control has slipped since COVID. I have therefore dropped my rating to 4 stars. Too bad because I really like these belts and hope the issue will be fixed in the future.",
