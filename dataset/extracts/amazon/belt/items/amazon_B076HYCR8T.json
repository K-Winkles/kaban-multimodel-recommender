I am always in between holes it seems...This seems like a high-quality belt and buckle that can be trimmed to the length you prefer.

This is nice since it works to keep your pants up and gives you that \"professional\" look without the irritation when you sit.Overall, this is a nice, simple, comfortable belt that I would buy again.",

A pleasant surprise was that the buckle is more of a smoke or gunmetal gray than the chrome appearance in the product pictures. Even my review picture shows the buckle as being brighter than it really appears to the naked eye, which may be the result of automatic low light camera adjustments, angle, etc. Most importantly, no mechanical problems yet to speak of.The stretch belt that comes with the upgrade is just okay. Elasticity wasn't a feature I was looking for, but I knew what I was getting into, so no lost points there. As far as cutting the belt to size, I haven't yet. A little extra slack has a swashbuckling Han Solo vibe to it. We'll see how long the vibe lasts.",

The belt can also be adjusted to any size below the max and I have not had any issues with the buckle holding. Only downside is that to me it does not work with nicer clothes like dress pants.",

Here's what I LOVE about it - when I need to adjust my belt after a meal, or when driving, or when standing, etc., I used to have to remove the whole strap end, pull the belt out of the buckle, and put it on again fitting it into the next hole.No more! Now to adjust I simply open the clasp, slide the belt one way or the other, and snap shut again! I LOVE it!",
