                "reviewText": "This belt is nice enough; I only give it 4 stars for some subjective reasons which have to do primarily with casual vs. work, but also just basic comfort and wear:1) The buckle is too heavy; I wear a belt to keep my pants up, and the heavy buckle can actually pull my pants down at the crotch (the one place it'd be really noticeable when wearing a suitcoat);2) The buckle is heavy; I have to go through security every day, and this is the only belt I own which sets off the metal detector (I wear belts from Jos. A Bank and Alfani, typically). When I wear this belt, I have to get wanded (which is a problem because it takes time every trip into the building/new security within the building).3) The buckle is too casual. I had hoped to wear it with my dress clothes, but it doesn't look good with slacks; I can only really wear this belt with khakis or jeans, so it is a niche belt; I'd prefer to be able to wear my belt to work and with more casual outfits.4) This belt wears out quickly; I typically put a lot of wear on my belts and on my pants in general (I'm far too active for the dress clothes I wear, and overload my pockets fairly regularly), but this belt wears as quickly as belts on the lower end of quality that I buy; I had hoped that Tommy Hilfiger might make a belt that would be more durable.With all of those negatives out of the way, subjective as they are, this belt will do a nice job holding pants up, and it does look \"youthful\" or semi-casual, so it can be a nice belt for those in-between looks (in between casual and formal, such as dockers + polo, or to wear to the golf course). That's my take, and since I got the belt at a steep discount, I'd say it is worth what I paid.",

                "reviewText": "My son absolutely loves this belt however This is the 2nd one we had to order The 1st fall apart within a couple times of wearing but we were fortunate enough to be able to have it replaced @ no charge seeing iit broke-( the Belt buckle came a part) so it was replaced & we had a new one within 2 days which was so greatlyappreciated !!We received the 2nd one ( or replacement) on September18th & here we are exactly 2- months later November 17th & the exact same thing happened! However this time we are out of luck because we CANNOT RETURN IT or HAVE IT REPLACED because there's only a 30 day return- replacement on this product!! We just wanted to have it replaced again we don't want the money we just want a new belt that will last & not fall apart!! My 17 year old son loves this Belt ( especially the blue color side it's a perfect shade that matches many of his outfits & we have not been able to find the same shade any where else ) Seeing that it's a Tommy Hilfiger Belt I without a doubt expect it would last more than 2 months. I truly thought the replacement/ return policy was well more than 30 days!( my bad) Seriously a name brand Belt such as Tommy Hilfiger should not fall apart twice within 3 months!! Needless to say I am truly disappointed & beyond aggravated that now I have to either find a different belt thats close to the same color or shell out another hunk of money again on the same Damn Belt If it happens to fall apart once again hopefully it does within 30 days so we can be able to have it replaced!! No Belt that's supposed to be designer quality should fall apart within 2 months of buying it especially when it's taken care of & not worn every single day ! I'd say they definitely need to figure out this Flaw with the belt buckle falling a part!! And the kicker of course wouldn't ya know it tonight there's a special function that were attending that he planned to wear that belt!!! Good Grief .... doesn't it figure",
