But I wanted a belt that was lighter than a leather belt and not cotton to use when I am hiking.The webbing is strong but the metal buckle exceeded my expectations. I was thinking it would be a cheap plastic buckle but it's got a nice metal one whose teeth hold the webbing in place quite well.Absolutely worth the price",
