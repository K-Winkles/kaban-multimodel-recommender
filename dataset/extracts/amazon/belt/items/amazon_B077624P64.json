                "reviewText": "When I first got this belt, it felt somewhat stiff and cheap to me. However it has performed quite well in daily use for the last three months. No cracking, splitting, delaminating... it really is one solid piece of leather. Now I'm a bit overweight, and drive a forklift for 8 hours almost every day. Thinner belt buckles or ones with sharp corners can dig into my gut and get really annoying by the end of the day. The black rounded buckle on the belt I got, is super comfy and is at least a good .25 inch thick on the top and bottom. Best $20 dollar belt I ever bought.",
