But here's the pleasant surprise \u2013 the stretch in these belts is incredibly comfy. Even for someone like me who usually avoids stretchy waist clothes, I'm sold on the comfort.Styling-wise, they pair perfectly with shorts, and they've been my go-to all summer. What's impressive is that they look just as fresh as they did on day one. These belts turned out to be the ultimate summer staples! \u2600\ufe0f\ud83d\udc56\ud83d\udc4c",
