                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best Belts Ever!!",
                "reviewText": "These belts are simply awesome.The back story everyone can relate to:For years I had so many leather dress belts, the regular ones where to fasten it you pushed the clasp/pin/buckle through one of the many holes in the leather. We all have those belts, and yeah, those work of course. But those types of belts always wear pretty bad. They develop creases/wear marks from having to pull the belt back on itself in order to insert the closing pin into the hole. And they wear around the actual holes just from daily use. Plus, whenever you'd gain/lose an inch off your waste and would need to start using one of the adjacent holes, the belt would look really bad since all of the wear marks would be really obvious on the sizing hole which you had been using.I think I wrote that clearly, and those problems should make sense to anyone who has ever worn a belt.So, the awesome solution: These new types of belts!The locking mechanism is kinda genius. As you slide the belt through the front buckle, you can hear the locking mechanism clicking on the back side of the leather, and it hold in place without slipping. If you want it a little tighter, just push it through another click. When you want to remove it, just pull out on the buckle and the belt releases easily. Imagine a zip tie, push it through, click click click, locked in place. But unlike a zip tie, these belts release. The buckle looks like a normal belt, gives the illusion that it is held with a closing pin.Best part is that there are no holes to wear out! And, since there aren't any holes & no closing pin to push through, you don't ever fold the belt over on itself... So these belts really don't wear out.I bought a belt like this randomly years ago, and it quickly became my go-to belt, then it became the only belt I ever use. Still works great, still looks great, doesn't appear to have any wear on it.So now, I have purchased three more that are listed here on Amazon. I wanted to make sure I have a brown one, and a black one, I keep my original one in my travel luggage so I always have one handy, I've given one to my brother as one of those 'must haves' gifts. I can tell you that these belts listed here are excellent quality, the racheting mechanism works great. And, the sizing process is super easy with very clear instructions.I dont often leave reviews, but I had to for this. Definitely, you should buy a couple of these.",

I carry a telezon gun for ordering and instead of laying the gun down, I slide it in the belt behind me and carry it everywhere I go. Belt is so easy to tighten and loosen as needed during the day. Made a big change for me. Maybe a year now? I never want to go back to the old. Totally Awesome!No problems. Lost weight and it was so easy to cut out an inch to shorten the visible end. So resizing is not an issue. It was true to size for me when I bought it, and still No sign of wear. This one is for real.",
