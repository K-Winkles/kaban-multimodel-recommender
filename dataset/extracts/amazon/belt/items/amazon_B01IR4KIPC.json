                "reviewText": "This is a very good quality belt. The D rings are sturdy. The material is durable and smooth. The color looks nice and is solid color. I bought three belts, and I will be using them for casual pants and shorts. With the wide belt strap and the D rings, you can pull the belt strap to tighten down and get that secure fit. The 47\" belt is very long, and actually needs a belt clip on the end so it does not flap around. To me, it's like what football players wear on their pants to strap them down tight. And that's why I like these. This is how they differ from leather belts and synthetic leather belts.Similar belts like this are used for belt for work pants and work shorts. It works good for me because I run the belt through the rings, and I tug the strap to cinch it around my waist. It makes a tight wrap on the waist and works with simplicity.It looks good enough to wear with Khakis, and these belts are good for more heavy duty blue collar work or activities; but they are actually too nice. You actually don't want to scuff them up. Originally the price was good too, affordable at $7.99. Recently that price is raised to $ 9.99. It's a real deal at 7, but they added 2 dollars.I own 4 belts: Black, white, gray, and khaki colored.The shipping and delivery, for me, took two full business days, not a long wait.I would have liked a sale price, which I did not receive, but I like the belts.All Praise the Most High. All praises, honor, and glory to Yahawah Bahashim Yahawashi. The King is Coming soon.",
