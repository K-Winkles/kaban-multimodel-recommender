                "reviewText": "I bought this three times. In the last 4 years. I wear it every day. Every day. Everyday use will wear it out in about 16 months. After that many uses it'll show bends and frays, but hey, it's brown on one wide and black on the other, you can wear it with anything and it'll take a beating. If I could complain about anything, I'd say it's a tad too wide. With one pair of suit pants I have, the belt loops are not big enough for the width of the belt to fit. For European suits, the belt loops are a little smaller.One other thing. I have discussed this with a fre other guys and they know what I'm 5alking about, maybe you can relate. You ever bend over to tie your shoes while wearing a t shirt or otherwise without having a shirt tucked in, and the hair around your belly gets caught in the belt buckle, and then when you stand up it rips the hair out? Something about men that women don't know exists. Well, this belt isn't immune to that but it's better than the other three belts I have especially considering the belt buckle pivots. So you should be good there.",
