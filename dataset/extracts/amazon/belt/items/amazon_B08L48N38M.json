I figured it was another accessory running off the belt and dealt with it. It finally got bad enough to take off the belt and see what accessory was failing. Low and behold, it was the Tensioner again. It's too bad it is 14 days after the warranty ran out. I wish I had checked right away, but I didn't. Long story short, buy a good one, not this cheapo. I guess there is a reason why the other tensioners are $100 more.",

The belt still fits just need to route it around the water pump last instead of the AC pulley or power steering pulley. My OEM idler pulley bearing seized about 30k miles ago and melted, auto parts store sold me the 70mm pulley so im not sure what size the OEM pulley was originally but the 90mm one included here works without issue.",
