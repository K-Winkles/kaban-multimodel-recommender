Mine wore and fit great, it showed no signs of abnormal wear from me wearing it but then again I don't have the \"overhang\" that would probably cause what these other reviewers have experienced. I ordered a 34 and it set back about 4 holes, while it held the pants up I was wearing it was not stressed by other burdens that hang around the waist. it did its job and still looks good!",
