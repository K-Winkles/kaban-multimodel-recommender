                "reviewText": "* Overall Impression:-Note: There are several style, type and color variations in the listing.-I'm reviewing the reversible full grain style with no stitching detail.-It's an excellent value for the excellent quality, how well made and constructed it is and the quality of the real leather itself. It looks nice, fits belt loops well and is reversible (not all variations are).* Pros-what I liked and what worked well:-Excellent value for the style, quality of the leather and construction.-Real, genuine, high quality leather. It even has the real leather scent (not overwhelming). It\u2019s marked as genuine leather on the inside of the belt. It\u2019s a good thickness and weight for the leather and belt.-Reversible (in this variation, some aren't) you can use either side of it for different colors.-Excellent quality of the make and construction. It's a very well made, high quality belt.-Standard style buckle. Easy to use, secure and take on and off. Heavy duty metal alloy buckle.-Fit standard pants and jean belt loops well, not too narrow or too wide.-Hand assembled. (You don't have to assemble it, it's pre-assembled.)-No unpleasant scent to it.* Cons-what I didn\u2019t like and what didn\u2019t work well:-No issues.* Tips & Thoughts:-I'd highly suggest picking the full grain variation vs the ones with visible stitching on either side. Belts that are full grain with no visible stitching tend to last a lot longer from my experience. Belts with stitching tend to have rips, failure and wear where they are stitched vs belts without stitching in the full grain style. I always choose full grain with no stitching at all whenever possible.-Look closely at the pictures for each variation in the listing, they are very different.-Be sure and measure for the right size. If between sizes, size up vs down. Order at least 2-4 inches larger than your waist size.-There is a paper tag on the inside of the belt you may need to carefully remove before use.",

                "reviewText": "This belt is a solid option and does check all the boxes for quality in a reversible belt. I will use it, but, truthfully, it is not my favorite. Reasons:~I am not a fan of the holes all the way around. The pics that the manufacturer provides does not give good perspective on the look of the belt overall. It has the buckle holes the entire length of the belt. Not ugly, but not my favorite.~Size up. I wear either a 38 and 40 inch waist, depending on the jean maker. I ordered the 38, knowing the belt rule of size up, but figuring it would fit. It does, but I am on the first hole of all those holes all the way around the belt.. LOLOverall, I would recommend the belt to others as long as they understand these items.",

                "reviewText": "I was this was priced so well for such a well-known, premium brand. The belt is of quality and has that wonderful new leather scent. The switchable buckle (to show either brown or black leather sides) is easy to operate and feels solid when buckled. The color and sheen (not too shiny) and stitching all look great as does the pewter-like appearance of the buckle. I think this is a great look for casual wear.One observation, for me at least, belts tend to get a bit of a permanent swoop in the back where they come in contact with the back belt loop. This would get flipped around when I switch colors so not sure if it will make the belt wear strangely. So far, it seems fine but time will tell how this affects the belt.Overall, I am happy with the purchase.",

The size of the belt is from end to end, which means, if you don't add 2-4 inches to the size of the belt, you'll end up with a belt that doesn't close! The same goes for pretty much every belt on the market.These belts are nice and thick and look great. The beauty of being reversable cannot be overstated - it's 2 belts in one.Perfect for casual use, and strong enough for all you rooten' tooten' gun slingers out there who carry concealed weapons. Properly taken care of, these belts will last you years and keep looking good the whole time!",

                "reviewText": "These \u2018Men's Premium Leather Reversible Belts for Men by Levi\u2019 are very nice. They are sturdy, with solid looking buckles that aren\u2019t overly sized or gaudy, the stitching is clean, and they are exactly sized. There are four different styles listed, and at first glance the only difference is color (and for one of them, a double prong buckle). We ordered black. When we got it, the entire belt has holes cut out all the way around the belt, not just along the 6 inches or so where you thread it through the buckle. It\u2019s kind of weird looking. To be fair, the detail pictures show this, but only if you are looking closely, because neither the product description nor the main photo show it.",

                "reviewText": "There is a lot to like about this belt. It is thin and lightweight, but at the same time it is sturdy. I found the sizing to be accurate and the fit to be comfortable. The material feels quality, and it is visually appealing. It holds up to repeated use without fraying or cracking. It is not thick enough to carry tools or other heavier equipment on, but it will easily handle a phone clip or other device holder. I would highly recommend this belt for both its style and durability.",

I thought this was a terrific price for name-brand belts that were probably made in a Chinese factory of cheap leather (actually Mexico of good leather). The belt itself is excellent, even if it is from the cheaper Signature line, but the photo and description are still misleading.",

This is a really good price, a great brand and it is very well constructed so I'm sure this will last a long time. The reversible feature is really handy so this might just be the last belt I ever need.",
