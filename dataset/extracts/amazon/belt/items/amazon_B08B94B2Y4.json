                "reviewText": "Carhartt should be ashamed! How can you screw up a making a belt? First, use low quality leather that scrapes off the color the first time you try it on. Second, make a buckle that has a frame that is too narrow for the belt to slip through. Third, and this took some effort, make the holes too small for the buckle\u2019s prong to fit through. Quality control is top notch here! If still interested in purchasing a piece of crap like this, it is available in both, black and brown. Hey Carhartt, what happened to your pride in making good products?",
