The belt is nice but I have a 34 waist so got the 34-36\" option barley seem long enough but it works.The belt isn't stretchy at all so make sure you get a good size. Other then that it fits nice, looks nice, well have to see how long it lasts but so far I enjoy it",

I am an older male with the standard increasing stomach and lowering waist line causing my pants to always ride down. The material is strong, yet looks nice. I have worn it to work in very dirty conditions, then wore it to church. The ratchet mechanism is simple to work making adjustments quite easy. I will be ordering more.",

                "reviewText": "Really liked the belt for ease of adjustment and the sleek style, with the hidden end. However the weak link of the design is the small screws/pins holding the pivot of the locking mechanism. Mine broke after about 15 months, with 5 days a week use. I was able to sort of fix it for a few weeks but the spring inside gave out and the latch is now completely loose. Still useable, however it is just not as convenient to secure, as I have to manually force the latch to shut each time.",
