                "reviewText": "This is a very nice men's braided belt. It stretches a lot, all over. The elastic braided design is unique and it\u2019s clear that a lot of thought has gone into the materials used. It\u2019s comfortable to wear and doesn\u2019t lose its shape, even after wearing it for a whole day. The style is very casual.I really like the no-hole design. That allows me to adjust the belt to my exact waist size.However, I did have an issue with the sizing. I ordered my usual size, but the belt was very loose. When I tighten it to my waist size I'm left with too much excess. Some people may even like having a lot of excess, however, it's not my preference, even for a casual belt. If you\u2019re considering buying this belt, I would recommend getting a smaller size than you usually would, unless you're going for the look of a lot of slack.Overall, it\u2019s a good belt with a stylish design and durable construction. But the sizing issue does affect the overall experience. Hence, I would give it 3 stars. Perhaps if I had got the smaller size I'd have been much more happy with it.",
