The ratcheting buckle is what I needed as I have a stomach condition that causes frequent and large size changes in my waistline. I followed the suggestions to buy it extra large and cut it as needed. Worked great. I waited until I was large and measured & cut the belt back. The ratcheting part is long enough to compare to 6-8 belt holes on my normal belts, so at this point it's working perfectly and is very easy to adjust when necessary. Steady, minor adjustments are a constant need and this belt is working.",

My last belt lasted about two years before it just became a problem with the claws holding on to the leather. Don't over tighten your belt. IMO, that added to the leather being pulled on as I moved around. Now I ratchet it, then hit the release to see it if moved and it's more comfortable.If going for a simple belt, this is it for sure. Ratchet aspect makes it so simple to adjust. The buckle is very durable. I still have my previous buckle, just needs a new leather belt. If you want really long lasting, find that guy on tiktok that makes leather belts by hand, but $$$. These belts will do just fine for me.",

                "reviewText": "great belt and looks slick. the ratchet mechanism works really well so far. I can't comment on the durability as I've only gotten this recently but may update the review later on if I see the belt start to break down.it is extremely simple to use and the inconspicuous turn lever to release the belt just below the belt buckle, is a nice touch to its design. unlike the traditional notch belts where the notches would get stretched out the longer you use it, the ratchet system on this belt seems very durable.",
