            "SIZING: For best fit, select a belt size 2 inches larger than your pant size. For example, if your pant size is 34, shop belt size Medium (36-38). Strap is 1.4 inches wide for a standard fit that will fit all of the belt loops in your closet."

                "reviewText": "I love this belt. I used to wear one of these. It was the first brand I tried so I didn't think much about trying a cheaper option once it was pretty stretched after years of use. Price was the sole factor for me chosing something else. This belt is great quality and a good buy at this price. The $5 I saved was not worth it. The other belts held up well but were not as well constructed l. And that choice to go with the cheap belts was a painful choice my wife and I. This belt uses a single prong with a ball on the end. The other belts I've tried had double prong with no ball on the end. First off the single prong belt is easier to use. Secondly let me tell you if you're going to accidentally step on one of these belts in the middle of the night you want it to be this one. The other belts never went into my foot if I stepped on the prongs but I had some amazing blood blisters. And the prongs on the cheap belt would bend if stepped on, especially if you step on the leather side of the buckle. Once they get bent they weaken and bend from normal use. They eventually broke off and now I'm very thankfully back in a Dickies.",

That\u2019s more of a no problem but it is a little less secure than your average metal buckle belt. 4.5 stars.",
