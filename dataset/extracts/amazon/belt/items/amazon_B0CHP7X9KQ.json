I went to a local outlet mall and found every belt to cost a minimum of $48.00. This belt is much nicer than the store belt, and I really like the stitching design. I wear the black side for work and the brown side for church, so this dual belt will be handy. I couldn't beat the $14.00 price. It arrived on time and was in a very stylish package (which I'll repurpose to wrap a gift in). Very impressed!",
