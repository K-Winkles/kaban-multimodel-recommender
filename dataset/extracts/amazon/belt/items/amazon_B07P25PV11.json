They are a good quality, and seem as if they will hold together well, but the \"leather\" is fake and you can tell. I probably won't be wearing either belt with a shirt tucked in. It isn't all that attractive. But they do the trick to hold up jeans and other pants that have that gap in the back waist, or that are a bit too large. They are exactly what I expected and I am satisfied.Some have mentioned that the belts don't adjust, or are hard to adjust. I simply didn't find that to be the case. Maybe those folks were not familiar with the type of sliding adjustment that these belts have. The first time I wore mine, I slid them to the largest size (they come with a small size adjustment). I put the belt in my pants, and then adjusted the belt after I had my pants on. Now, I put on my pants then the belt, and then do any final adjustments from there. Simple!",

We tried no belts but school said he needed one, I guess he was too distracted pulling them up. We couldn't go smaller 28x34 is loose on him and there was no way I'd let him only wear sweat pants. This is a belt without any stress for him, he only needed a day before he was used to the small amount of extra tension needed to button it and his pants stay where they belong. Super happy with them, hopefully they last but even 6 months I'd consider good because of the very reasonable price and how well they work for him.",

And I'm upset that I am only discovering them now.They are COMFY and FUNCTIONAL.And I am NEVER going back. I got the brown and black one - and will get the blue version when it comes back in stock. So glad I decided to go with something different on this.Just do it - you won't regret it.P.s. I did have to go up to XL even though my waist range was within L, but nonetheless, quick exchange, and boom - they feel perfect. And they work!",
