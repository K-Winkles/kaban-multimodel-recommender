                "reviewText": "Ordered the clip belt in thinking it would be faster once I got it sized. Boy was I wrong! First I noticed the actual clip (male side) is completely plastic. Next the buckle (either side) barely fits through the belt loops on my Carhartt double front work pants. When I finally got it around the and was tightening it to size I noticed it stretched! Why?? I now see it says flex in the description but it doesn't mention that in the title. A belt that stretches kinda defeats the purpose not to mention since I have to over tighten it to compensate for the stretching, the buckle is under a lot of stress. Only a matter of time before the little plastic tabs break off. Sending back.",

                "reviewText": "This belt had the potential to be fantastic. It seems durable, and I like the adjustability, however, the belt buckle is too large, which drives me absolutely nuts. Even on a pair of Carhartt pants where it should fit easily. It is very tedious to put the buckle through the belt loops. It barely fits through each loop and you have to wrestle it through each one, takes way to long to put on or take off.",

                "reviewText": "It is a good sturdy belt however it wasn't what I wanted so I returned it. For one it's pretty thick and wide compared to most web belts, it doesn't bend or give easily. Second, the \"buckle\" clasp is kind of big and combined with the stiffness of the belt, I found the belt cumbersome to slide/fit under avg belt loops. Finally, adjusting the length of the belt on the fly is also more difficult than picking a hole or pulling it through a double loop. Overall it was just too much effort for me, I wanted something more basic and simple. If you are looking for a more robust work belt though this might be a good option.",
