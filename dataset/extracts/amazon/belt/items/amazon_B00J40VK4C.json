Inconsistency in measurement??Ordered my son the 33-35 as he is a 34 inch waist. The excess on the belt once cinched lined up so that the leather loop the excess goes through was right where his pant (Wrangler) loop is, and was very short, looked goofy.Returning the larger, as no sense to wear if doesn\u2019t keep your pants up. Kid is bummed, but wearing the other, he\u2019s just skipping loop through the jeans loop, which looks non symmetrical and stands out, but as fashion cautious as he is, he deemed good enough. I figure for price it was okay to keep, BUT HE BETTER WEAR IT OR I WILL SEND BACK FOR REFUND. He gives 3 stars. I give 2 stars as goofy looking is below average expectation.This link on WHAT SIZE BELT SHOULD I BUY I found helpful, and agree. This belt in appropriate size per sizing guide/stated measurements did not follow these guidelines. Again, length of tail being too short looks goofy. And skipping a pant loop even more silly.",

For reference my waist is a 28/29 and I purchased a medium. You want to stay in your range and don\u2019t go over or under. This belt fits me like a give with my buckle and there is no excess hang over and it\u2019s definitely not too short. It\u2019s definitely worth the money and the belt is sturdy and well embossed",
