The belt only allows a small amount of stretch, enough to be comfortable. Never sags strong thick stretch material. It's a perfect combination of stretch and firmness. Why can't the buckle slide through standard belt loops? It is to prevent the equipment you wear from falling off while using the toilet. The belt will fit through your belt loops but the buckle will not, however you can easily take the buckle off and put it back on after you have looped it through. For a 42\u201d waist which is better the 36\u201d-42\u201d or the 42\u201d-46\u201d? The full length of the Medium-for Waist 36\u201d-42\u201d is 49\u201d. There is a length of 7 inches that can allow your tail to leak out, so you can choose a Medium-for Waist 36\u201d-42\u201d. Who is suitable for using this tactical belt? The tactical belt suits for military, SWAT, fire fighters, worker, sporter and other outdoorsman. Anyone who do physical activities for a long period of hours will get a great use out of the belt.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good heavy duty belt. It's easy to adjust, especially if you just had a big meal and need to loosen the belt a bit. There's also a little bit of stretch in the belt. It's easy to buckle and unbuckle. Because of the width of the belt the buckle won't fit through most belt loops, so you'll have to take the buckle off to thread the belt through the loops. That's not a big problem because the buckle is easy to put back on. Now comes the fly in the ointment. If you thread the belt like you normally would then the tail of the belt will be on the opposite side of where it would normally be. If you want the tail to be on the side that it normally is then you have to thread the belt in the opposite direction.",

                "reviewText": "Sure it's advertised as Tacti-Cool, but it really is a well designed belt. The 1 1/2inch width ought to fit any standard belt loops for men or women and it's thick enough to provide structure. Sure it holds pants up, but it also keeps the waistband from curling any when bending. The material can actually hold some weight. My knife holster or mutli-tool are easy and comfortable to attach. And I LIKE that the belt buckle cannot slide through the loops! If it did, the weight of items on the belt would cause it to come out of place and possibly even drop things on the floor every time I used the bathroom (especially gross in a public restroom). Unless you have extra large belt loops, the buckle doesn't allow this. Plus, it's easy and fast to remove and reattach when you want to. I also prefer belts with a slide adjustment instead of preset holes, which I would otherwise end up modifying most of the time. The buckle stays flat against my belly, but it does stick out a little. I'm fine with a little belt-bump. The buckle looks to be made well and ought to last.",

I never write reviews but i just tried this belt on for the first time and felt compelled.Half of the buckle clasp can be removed effortlessly so belt it can fit through almost any belt pant loops without fighting it. And its design allows you to easily put the buckle clasp exactly where you think it fits best when belt is already around your waist. And the best part the buckles is comfortable yet feels heavy and well crafted like you know the metal is heavy duty and isn't going to break. The clamp and clasp is rugged cool style.Looking at the direction paper that fell out was well worth it! And great packaging!Best belt i have ever tried on!",

                "reviewText": "I have owned several belts like this over the years. Most had cheap, plastic buckles that would wear out and break. I have a larger waist and wear size 56 pants. It is hard to find belts that fit comfortably, or even fit at all. I ordered two belts from Amazon, thinking neither would really fit. However, I was VERY surprised by this belt. First, the JUKMO was the cheaper of the two. Second, I was immediately impressed by the packaging. I was expecting a belt in a plastic bag, like the other belt I purchased. The JUKMO was not only packaged in a nice box, but it was also inside a nylon pouch inside the box. Clean and neat packaging. The next thing I noticed was the buckle itself. It felt like a strong metal, not some cheap fabricated thing that would fall apart soon. I have been using this belt for over a year now, and I LOVE it. I just purchased my second belt about two weeks ago.I work in law enforcement, and I use this belt as a part of my uniform. I wear a firearm in a Safariland paddle ALS holster, a radio, and keyring. I also usually have several items in my pants pockets. This belt fits snug, and I have never had an issue with it coming loose or sagging. I was constantly having to retighten my previous nylon belt from Propper. The Propper belt had a plastic buckle that would break frequently under the load, and I would have no option but to purchase another. So far, with the construction of the JUKMO belt, I have not had that problem. Over time, like anything else, it will show wear. I have a small fray starting to develop where I wear my holster, but the belt has held up much better than my expectations, especially for the price. The cobra style quick release buckle is tough and absolutely amazing. The buckle offers an easy adjustment lever that locks in place but is simple to remove when running the belt through belt loops. Easy on and off. This is a great belt, and I don't see me going with another any time soon!",

                "reviewText": "After years of a woven leather belt, and dual loop nylon belts, my brother convinced me to try one of these, and now I don't wear anything else. Its comfortable, easily adjustable, easy to unclip for relaxing or using the restroom and simply sleek as well. I tend to fidget, so I've unclipped and reclipped the belt far too many times in the time I've had it and the mechanical pieces are still holding up well. However, I don't use the belt for \"tactical\" or \"duty\" use-cases so I can't speak to its efficacy in that regard.The only gripe I have with it is that there is a little elastic band that is for retaining the excess belt length when worn. This band is a separate piece that tends to get caught on my belt loops when putting on/taking off the belt, and because of this I've nearly lost it about a dozen times. Just be smart and keep track of it, I suppose.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Bought the medium 36\"-42\" (49\" length) black belt even though I am have a 33-35\" waist. I was thinking I could always cut it to length. I realized that I like the way I can put the excess through the first two belt loops on my right side, keeping it nice and tidy, and out of the way.My waist seems to expand and contract throughout the day so I thought this belt would be ideal for me with its quick adjustment mechanism. I was right and it has paid itself off in aces. For example, in the morning my waist is the slimmest. After a meal like lunch, my waist expands and I can adjust the belt quite easily. When I drive, the quick release is great so my belly doesn't feel the pressure of the belt. I always have the right pressure keeping my pants up throughout the day!The locking mechanism is very good as well. The clasp is \"U-shaped\" and evenly distributes the pressure so that the belt material will not rip due to a sharp \"scissor-like\" locking part. The belt is a bit stiff so it does require a bit of oomph to close it, but you'll get used to it.Opening the mechanism is a bit though. You need some finger nails to get under the flap and then pull with a bit of force. I did find a better way to open it. If you put your fingers under the belt part and push up on the flap, it will undo the clasp enough to comfortably put a couple of fingers under it to unlock it.The belt material has some elasticity to it. I uploaded a video showing this. It's hard to tell from the photos so I decided to take a video of it to make it clear. The elasticity is strong so the material does feel secure and will not loosen unduly (i.e. it doesn't feel like your pants are going to fall down at any time).Some reviewers said that it was a small hassle to undo the belt to move it from one pair of pants to another. I found that it wasn't a problem at all. The fact that the two buckle parts do not easily slip through the belt loops is a bonus for me. I don't know how many times my leather belts would slip off the belt loops and fall to the floor when I hung up my pants on hooks - a real annoyance.After using a lot of different belts that each have unique locking mechanisms, this one is the best of all. I can confidently say that this is the best belt design I have seen and it suits my needs perfectly. I highly recommend this belt due to its design and quality materials. Give it a try!",

Durch die klappbare Verstellung auch sehr gut und schnell durch die G\u00fcrtel\u00f6sen einzuf\u00e4deln.",

                "reviewText": "Qui c'\u00e8 poco da dilungarsi la cintura \u00e8 fatta benissimo, resistente, ottimi materiali ed \u00e8 comodissima. Ottimo packaging curato. Facile da mettere in altri pantaloni grazie al sistema a doppio sgancio. Molti si lamentano che la fibbia non passa dai passanti dei jeans e dei pantaloni, ma per farlo bisogna sganciare il regolatore di lunghezza, lasciando la fibbia agganciata. Cos\u00ec non \u00e8 necessario far passare la fibbia dai passanti. Bel prodotto, fatto bene, ottimo e versatile. Comoda e super consigliata.",
