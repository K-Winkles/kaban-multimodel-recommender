But we all need different sizes that aren't normally 1 inch apart! Mission Belt has revolutionized the belt by removing those standard fixed buckles and holes. Our belts use a ratcheting system to allow you to customize your perfect fit by making 1/4 inch micro adjustments and we paired it with easy-to-use, stylish buckles to lock your belt in place and a quick release lever. It's time to throw away those old saggy belts and start fresh with a perfectly fitting Mission Belt.",

I guess I'll jump in the Delorean and go back to April 26, 2013 to when I, and millions of others, first discovered Mission Belts.I was watching Shark Tank, as I always do, and a pitch of a new (to me anyway) type of belt came on. It was the guys from Mission Belt and I was immediately intrigued.....and by intrigued what I really mean is that I had to have one! Disappointment quickly set in as I messaged Mission on Facebook to ask if their buckles were nickel free ( I am allergic to nickel ) and I was told \"Yes\". Fast forward to 12/2018 and on a whim, I decided to reach out again to see if the buckle material had changed. This time, I was told that while there might be nickel in the buckle that I should try the colored buckles as they paint may just block the nickel in them. That was good enough for me. I ordered one belt and two buckles and in two days, they where here. I put them on and trimmed down the belt to fit me (which I'll get to in a second) and wore my new belt for a day. To my relief, no reaction from the buckle! It's now March 14th, 2019 and I have worn the belt and buckle everyday with zero skin reaction! Now, a few notes:1) The quality of the leather belt is AMAZING.2) I have lost 100 pounds over the last year and am still losing weight. The ability to trim the belt to size has been a huge perk. No longer do I need to buy a new belt that fits for every 5-10 pounds I drop.3) The buckle is VERY well made and they look incredible! I will say that you should definitely take the 2 minutes and read the instructions on how to work the belt. When I got mine I thought \"how hard can it be\" and just trimmed the belt, put the buckle on, and put my new Mission Belt on. while I was driving, nature called and by the time I arrived at my destination was REALLY calling. I ran to the mens room and, wouldn't you know it, I couldn't figure out how to get the buckle un-done *\"D'OH!\"*. So there I was, in the mens room frantically looking up the how to video on YouTube......I found it and un-fastened my buckle without a moment to spare =)I can't say enough great things about nor recommend enough, Mission Belts. I'd like to buy three or four more but unfortunately am unable to swing it financially ( I'll spare you the details =) )",

                "reviewText": "My wife gave me a Mission Belt for Christmas several years ago. It immediately became my favorite belt. The micro adjustment means the belt fits perfectly - no more wishing there was a belt hole halfway between the existing holes. Later I found a knock off at a discount store. The knock off worked okay, but the action was not nearly as smooth. The knock off also wore out after a year or two of use. Bought this strap to bring life back to my original Mission Belt. I will probably buy again; but not anytime soon because I expect this strap to last 5+ years like the first one did.",

This one is, in fact, a replacement for my brother\u2019s canvas one after his wore out from daily usage over several years.If, like me, you have a bit of a paunch that requires an occasional micro adjustment for comfort\u2019s sake, this is the belt for you.I much prefer the leather over the cloth varieties, as it is much more durable. Also, the paint or powder coating. (whatever it is.) scratches very easily. So if you plan on wearing it in dressy situations, I would recommend staying with the non-coated buckles.",
