                "reviewText": "I purchased two of these belts to replace the old one I have had since the Army in 1970. I was happily surprised to see how strong the belts were, wider than my old belt, and very easy to cut to adapt to my waist size. They work well on my jeans and also on casual slacks. I like the metal buckle that holds very well. I took off one star for stretch, but I don't think these belts are suppose to stretch and I'm happy they do not.Great belts, I'd buy again.",

They're satisfactory for an upcoming European trip going thru TSA. The really outstanding thing was the top rate customer service the company provided. Very responsive with their immediate replies and solution to my concern. Time will tell how they hold up but they should work well for our trip, and at this point I'd buy again and would definitely choose to work with Jasgood again.",

                "reviewText": "They're not bad, but I don't trust the buckles, which is probably why they came with two extra ones which they call \"free gifts\". They know they're going to break. The belts themselves are heavy duty, though, maybe too heavy duty just to hold up a pair of pants.Other than that, the buckles are a bit grabby if you don't hold it all just right when you try to loosen it, and the way they lock down it can be difficult to get the belt actually tight. They do work and I'm going to continue using them, at least until the buckles break. After that I might try to find some that are better and keep using the belt part.For the price, I guess it's worth buying if you want something simple and cheap. Just don't fall in love with them, not that there's any risk of that happening, because they're not going to be around for long. Oh, and the little loop to hold the tail end? That thing slides all over the place. I tossed it.",

                "reviewText": "I like these belts, and I am going to keep them. I bought this pack along with a single belt with a metal and plastic buckle for a few dollars less. I have always had metal belt buckles so I wasn't sure about the plastic and how cheap it might feel. After reviewing and comparing all the belts I bought, I ended up more concerned about the webbing material being sufficient than the buckles, and both seem fully up for the task.I am a size 37 waist so I purchased the \"up to 40\" pack of these belts. The sizing is perfect to the point I don't have to trim them at all, which is great for me because I can be a bit lazy, and buying something that allows you to customize it, and then not needing to customize it, is a big bonus in my book. I compared the plastic buckles in this pack to the other belt I bought, and they are all the exact same. The metal buckle has a heftier weight, obviously, and a little more sheen. These buckles definitely look plastic with a texture. However, they are so light I forget they are there, and I can't say the same for the metal buckle.When I compared these belts to the other one I bought I found the black in this pack and the other belt were the exact same webbing. When I swapped the plastic bonus buckle for the other belt in place of the metal, and held the two belts together, I couldn't tell the difference. Both black belts feel the same, have the same thickness, and both are angle cut on the ends to allow and easy time threading through the buckle and pant loops. The only thing about the other belt is it's a much longer length that you trim to fit, which makes it great for larger waists. However, I stressed all three belts and I didn't feel a difference in pull and resistance with any of the buckles or webbing. I also really like the blue in this, since it has a different look and offers an alternative. I've actually worn the blue mostly in the past week since it looks so nice.I originally though I would prefer the premium feel of the metal buckle to these plastic ones, but for a few dollars more, the bonus of having 2 belts with 4 buckles to work with far outweighs any sense of \"premium feel\" the metal buckle offers, and I don't have to do any trimming. Coming from full grain leather belts for work pants and jeans, I thought these might feel too cheap for me, but I like them very much for my shorts in the summer due to the lightweight feel.I am sending the other belt with the metal buckle back, and keeping this two pack. If for some reason the plastic buckles don't hold up over time, I will update this review. For now, I am rating it 5 stars because the finish and value seem spot on at this price point, and in the pool of Amazon with all the copies of webbing belts, I think this pack stands out as a great option.",
