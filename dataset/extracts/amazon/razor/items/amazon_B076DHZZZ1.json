I don't care for stacked blades like the Red Baron's Airplane for like twenty buck packages where if my beard is too much it hurts like hell.I want sharp razor, cheap price.Wash your face then lather up. It will do the job. Without the white strip, dry shaving hurts like a Guantanamo Bay interrogation.The blades are sharp. I have cut my lip a few times; above the chin, etc.Again, a) wash your face of oils on the skin, b) lather up, c) take your time.My normal face will use one razor for over week. Washing takes the oil off your face as to stop the beard from blocking up between the blades.Let us say that I am old enough to know that I have never cut my face up so much.",
