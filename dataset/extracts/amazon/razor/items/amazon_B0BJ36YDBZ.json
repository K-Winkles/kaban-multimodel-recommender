                "reviewText": "For most women, shaving our legs is a chore that we dread. It's time consuming, and for many of us, uncomfortable. The search for the \"perfect\" razor is like the quest for The Holy Grail.This razor is a step up from a basic disposable razor. The shave head is flexible rather than fixed, so it helps to minimize the risk of cuts and it has some small moisture strips to help prevent razor burn. But, it is nowhere near as nice as some of the more expensive disposables with wide moisture strips, floating heads, and six blades. It gave me a fairly close shave but after using it my legs felt like they had been \"scraped\" clean of hair. They were a bit drier than I would have liked.I think these are fine for throwing in my overnight bag when on a quick trip. I wouldn't feel bad about using one of these for just a time or two and then throwing it away. But for day-to-day use at home I am still going to invest in a little nicer razor.",
