And the result that I got from it was an account suspension and 3 days of other hell dealing with Amazon over it. What was funny was after I had gotten suspension taken care of usually egift cards come in within 5 minutes. Now to my surprise this car did not come in in 5 minutes. I had contacted customer support through the chat and I was told that because of my account issue it would take up to 24 hours for someone to actually review this purchase. I was so flustered by that I called the 800 customer service line and got a completely different story and was told that the chat assistant person was incorrect on the story that they had told me. Quite frankly I find it hard to believe that if a thief were to steal from me that they would be sending it back to me. Laugh all you want but it got my account suspended for 2 days and it took a whole nother day to kind of resolve this stuff on my end and not even a single solitary apology or anything was made right to me in any way shape or form by buying this product.",

A gift card only has value if it is received. Be WARNED, RAXER GOLD WILL NOT REFUND FOR AN UNRECEIVED GIFT CARD! I spent much time trying to get my money back from Amazon, first, then from Razer Gold. Amazon cannot check the balance of these third party gift cards so they cannot return the money directly to the bank account. If the receiver never receives the card, you will need to talk to an Amazon SUPERVISER. The options are to resend the card, or to have the money refunded to the Amazon account. AMAZON made this right for me when I discussed the problem with a SUPERVISER, but RAZER refused to take responsibility for their own product that they sold to me through Amazon and refund my money. If you want a Gift card, stick to Amazon Gift cards ONLY. At least that way if anything goes wrong Amazon can confirm that the money was not used and can refund it directly to your account!",
