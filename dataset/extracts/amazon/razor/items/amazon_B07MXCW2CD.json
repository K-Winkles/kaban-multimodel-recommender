                "reviewText": "First Impressions:These razors are comfortable when you first use them. They look ok, and feel good in the hand. The packaging is fine and the blades have a protective cover attached.Positives:The razor actually feels very smooth at first. The price is better than most mid-grade brands at the local store. They rinse out easily without clogging up.Negatives:The shave isn't very close. It seems that they traded comfort for effectiveness. Yes, they shave stubble from daily to 3-days of growth. But feeling the skin after a shave reveals that they don't cut very close. After about 2 weeks, they get dull and rough, which significantly decreases the shaving comfort. I can usually get 2-3 times that life out of the Schick Extreme3, which also delivers a closer shave. (It's far superior to the Bic disposable razors.)Summary:Mid-grade razors that work ok, but have short lifespan and basic design aesthetics.",

It's like it glides too high over actual hair. First use might only have to re-do some spots 2 or 3 times, at different angles. After 3 or 4 uses be prepared to spend extra 5 minutes for finding missed spots. Looks good in mirror but upon rinsing I feel 2 3 4 5 areas that need re-doing. Amazon got rid of the good orange bics that were 40% cheaper & waayyy better quality. Tossing these out, not even worth using once or twice.",
