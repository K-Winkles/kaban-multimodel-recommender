                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great razor with a couple of really minor issues",
                "reviewText": "Took a chance on this razor. Wanted one with a pivoting head, not just flexible, floating blades. The description doesn\u2019t say it, but the head of the razor has good flexibility. It has 360 degrees of flex to follow the contours of my face. The individual blades are not floating blades, but they have enough give to work with the pivoting head to work well.I\u2019ve only used the razor a couple of times, but it shaves well. It isn\u2019t the best shaving razor I\u2019ve had, but it is better than my old Norelco Aqua. I haven\u2019t tried wet shaving with it, yet. Dry shaving is pretty good.The main thing I\u2019m pleased about, other than the pivoting head, is the size of the thing. The photoshopped images that all the \u201coff brand\u201d razors use, where the razor is pasted into a stock image of some guy in the shower or something, make the razors look huge. Even the user images in the review section don\u2019t give a good idea of scale. This razor is a very nice size. About 1/4\u201d longer than my 5 year old Norelco, but slimmer in the hand. The head is nicely proportional to the size of the body, and smaller than some others. It cuts nicely right up to the edge of my beard.The back side of the razor is soft-touch plastic, not the hard, shiny stuff. Great feel!One gripe I have is about the blue LED indicators you see in all the photos. They are printed on the plastic of the razor so that they are close to the actual LED lights in the razor. BUT, the actual LEDs are green and they don\u2019t line up with the blue icons printed. Maybe this is intentional, but it looks like a mistake. Better indicators would be nice. Not a very big gripe, I know...Oh, one more thing. Good and not so good. The razor comes with a stand that plugs in. I like the stand. I also like that it charges when you place the razor on the stand. Don\u2019t need to fiddle with it to get it plugged in, just set it in the stand and it works. HOWEVER, the red LED charging light doesn\u2019t change to tell you when it is done charging. It would be nice if the razor had an automatic system to stop charging when it is done, or at least a green light or some way to tell when the battery is fully charged. Excessive charging will eventually wear out the rechargeable battery.So, only minor gripes. The LED alignment and the charging issue. The razor shaves well and feels great ergonomically. The extra heads work fine, but weren\u2019t the main reason I bought this shaver, so in my mind, they are just a bonus.I\u2019ll try to post some decent photos later that show the actual size of the razor in proper scale. Will also try to remember to update after a few months to report on longevity.",

                "reviewText": "So instead of buying yet another replacement head for my 7 year old Norelco SensoTouch, I decided to give this one a shot (because it was 20 bucks).Very pleasantly surprised. I cant say anything to the product's battery life and/or longevity, as Ive only had it for a week. As for the results, it shaves just as close as the SensoTouch. Not as easy to clean since you cant pop the head off and remove the blades entirely, but the shave is close and cleaning it is easy enough. It doesnt \"feel\" as well made, so my guess is it wont last multiple years (and even if it did, I doubt you can buy replacement heads) but for 20 bucks even if it's only a disposable it's not a bad deal.",

                "reviewText": "Packaged like it came from the dollar store. A storage bag would have been a nice addition. I feel like no part of this shaver will last very long, but I can\u2019t say for sure because I\u2019ve only had it for a week, but it has a wide range of functionality via the included attachments:1. The 3-pad rotary shaver head works well, no complaints and no injuries or irritation. Again, who\u2019s to say how long it will stay sharp.2. The trimmer attachment also works just fine for manscaping. You could also probably cut your hair in a pinch.3. The nose-hair attachment. If, like me, you have long complained about the lack of power available to battery-powered nose-hair trimming wands, then you\u2019re in luck with this device. I think I can confidently state that you will never find a nose-hair trimmer with more torque than this device+attachment. It may even be worth buying for that alone.4. There\u2019s a brush attachment. I think the idea is you are supposed to apply shaving cream to your face? But who uses an electric shaver with shaving cream? IDK, anyway, it spins around. If that\u2019s what you need, a spinning brush, then this is a bonus.5. The remaining hunk of plastic included in the box is a stand. The idea is that it folds out and you plug the charger into the back, inserting the shaver into the top where it balances, standing up, while it charges. Unfortunately, I could not get it to work. I cleaned the contacts and fiddled with it for a while. Theres a short somewhere in it, but in truth, it looks like the balancing will be precarious at best and fall over all the time, so I gave up trying to make it work.Thats a lot of stuff which mostly works just fine. When I tested charge/discharge, my results were 1:40:15 to charge completely from 0, and 2:45:05 to discharge (just sitting there running with no resistance other than the shaver head being installed.) so do whatever you like with that information.",

                "reviewText": "This shaver does fine if you have fine stubble or light growth, however if you have a real beard... This thing does not take on the task well. It does not have a large enough area to hold whiskers as you shave, and cleaning this mid-shave is not ideal by any stretch of the imagination.All three heads have to be tilted outward from the middle of the shave head in order to clean it out. This requires nails, if you trim your nails short like I do then opening it requires a pocket knife or another tool to press in the buttons... While opening the other heads one may close on you leaving you to have to open 4-5x just to clean it out. For this reason of the non-existent tension while heads are open there is no \"tapping the shaver out in the sink\" mid shave.As far as the other accessories, I got a trimmer in mine. It was supposed to come with a face brush? I did not get one in mine and even triple checked the listing... Because of how cheap it was I didn't bother sending in for a replacement. It would of made it worth having though. I likely will toss it or keep it in a drawer as a last resort backup now...I would not recommend this to a friend because it's missing parts and is super hard to open the shaving head. (also mine appeared to be opened already and a possible returned item... That could be part of the issue...)",
