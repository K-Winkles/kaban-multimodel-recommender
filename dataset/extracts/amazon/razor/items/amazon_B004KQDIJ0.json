I purchased these razors in August 2014 looking for an economical solution to shaving, and I am very impressed that two years later I still have a few individual packs lefts! This order was enough to allow three people to shave with a new blade whenever they felt it needed replace unlike with more expensive blades we had tried to \"make last\" due to cost. Yes, they are not fancy, no pretty colors or curved handles but the blades are sharp and do their job. This two year supply (for 3 people!) cost less than one blade replacement pack would cost...unbelievable savings!",

I would personally give them a \"-1 star\" if possible because I could not shave one full leg before it dulled out. If you have a small area to shave for a single use I think they may be ok. I would not purchase these again.",

Although the razors last only a shave or two at the most.But at this price (less than $20 for 300 razors), whos counting. Delivery was quick and efficient, would definitely buy again when I run out (wont be for a while though ;-) )",
