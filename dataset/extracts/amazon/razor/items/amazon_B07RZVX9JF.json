Not sure if I got a bad batch but the lubrication doesn't seem to be much use on the blade. Have used 2 blades fresh out the box and both cut me up pretty good. I've used other more expensive blades and haven't had this issue. So I guess if you're afraid of getting cut up don't buy the big bundle. Try them out first before you buy a whole bunch.",
