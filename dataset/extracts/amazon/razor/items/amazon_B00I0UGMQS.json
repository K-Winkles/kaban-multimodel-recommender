These are basic things about a good razor that I can\u2019t compromise and give up.These razors met all of the requirements I need in a razor that I would most likely purchase again. In fact, this is my second time buying them. I am happy with the price; buying two packs each time doesn\u2019t scare me. I also like that they are disposable so I don\u2019t have to worry about buying blade refills that match the handle. All in all, I will turn to these in desperate times since they\u2019ve helped me tremendously.",

This is the product I have been looking for. Heres my story:This past summer my skin decided to blow up. My legs were covered in razor burn and itchy red bumps and as if that werent enough my underarms decided to do the exact same. My solution you ask? Wear leggings and long sleeve shirts in the 95 degree hot summer days. I tried EVERYTHING. I spent hundreds of dollars trying to find the best exfoliators, shaving cream, razors, moisturizers, after shave oils, ingrown hair treatments, even waxing strips and dipilitory creams. Nothing worked. I finally gave up and went to see my dermitologist. He recommended berenzol peroxide and a perscription for a topical lotion. In days my legs had cleared up and I was thrilled! However, my underarms still looked horrendus. I kept on with my search, deperate to find something. Then as I was scrolling through amazon, as any other person does in their free time, I stumbled upon this product. I had remembered my success with gillette venus in the past (before my skin blew up) but I had never tried these. It was exactly what I needed, smooth, sensitive razors. I clicked add to cart and within days I was in the shower putting these razors to use. I then hopped out of the shower, sat down at my vanity, and applied my razor burn treatment and moisturizer. I lifted up my arms and gasped. ALMOST NO RAZOR BURN! I ran to my computer and decided to write this review. I am beyond thrilled with this product. It changed my life. I am ready for summer!! I highly recommend for anyone who feels they have had this same issue its gonna save your underams and your confidence!",
