Great cost savings by buying in bulk, very familiar shave (just like the DSC blades) with no nicks or cuts. I haven't made great use of this extra \"trim\" edge on the reverse edge of the blade, it's a feature new to me, not one found on the DSC blades, but it's great at trimming-up my side burns. Overall, I highly recommend these for any DSC customer who has grown tired of DSC's shenanigans (changing blades and handles) and choses to use the old trusted DSC handle they've grown so accustomed to using.",

                "reviewText": "I had been using the Pace 4 razors for 2 years when I decided to check out the Pace 3. I shaved half of my face with the Pace 4 and the other half with the Pace 3 for several days (always the same half getting the same razor each day). I then installed fresh blades and did the same test but swapped sides.In both tests, the Pace 4 consistently left my face smoother immediately post-shave.I sometimes go several days without a shave. The Pace 4 can get clogged if I don't rinse after each pass (I should point out that unless I have almost a beard, the Pace 4 very very rarely clogs if I rinse between each pass). I had wondered if the Pace 3, with fewer blades and more open distance between blades, would be a better fit for those longer periods between shaves. I thought it might clean easier, or at least clog less. I did not bother testing how it clogged or how it cleaned when clogged. The shave itself was poorer enough compared to the Pace 4 that I just don't care.I did use Pace 6 blades once long long ago. I did not do a comparative test. I do remember them being exceedingly difficult to clean, and that's why I quit using those so early on.So I'm confident in choosing the Pace 4 as my lifelong razor. It gets a closer shave than other major name brand razors I've used. They are significantly less expensive. They last a long time (I bought 16 Pace 4 cartridges in June, 2017 and had two remaining in November, 2019). I do not shave everyday, though I did back in 2017, in more recent time I shave 3-4 times a week. And there are times in winter I just grow a beard instead. So your mileage will vary.",

I have very sensitive skin and shaving has always been hard for me. I try to only shave every three days to give my skin rest in between, but now that I am in the military I have to shave every day.The Pace 4 seems to pull at my hairs more than the Pace 3 did. I notice I have more razor burn now. I probably would not buy the Pace 4 again.Maybe the Pace 6 would work better for me. I might give them a try.UPDATE: Upon seeing my negative review of the Dorco 4, customer service emailed me and sent me the Dorco 6 to try at no charge. I like the 6 a lot better than the 4. It still pulls a little, but I have always gotten that even with expensive razors like Gillette Mach 3. It pulls a lot less than the 4 though. In terms of Dorco 3 vs 6, I think for me personally they are kind of comparable. I liked them both, so I may just save money next time and buy the Dorco 3. I definitely suggest trying the Dorco 6 if you haven't because it really is a good razor at a great price.The customer service of this business is also one of a kind. You really can't beat this product and customer service.",

                "reviewText": "I was pretty bummed when Dollar Shave Club changed their lineup. I tried and tried, but I just couldn't get to the point where I could say that I liked their new razors. Plus I still had a few brand-new handles from their old stock which I wanted to use. The problem was that their new razor heads do not fit the old handles.Dorco changed all of that. I'm using the 4-bladed heads, and I love them. Very smooth glide, and they take very few passes in order to get all the rough patches. Nicks and cuts are rare to the point that they might as well not happen at all. I'm also able to get nearly two weeks' usage out of each head before feeling the need to replace them. Throw in the fact that the price is well beyond reasonable, and I'm sold. Good product!",

                "reviewText": "I had bought Dorco blades direct in quantity many years ago. They incentivized purchasing many packs with flat-rate shipping. I bought so many on my last order they lasted about ten years! So, when I went to Dorco's site to buy more recently, I found they no longer sell direct. I have had problems buying counterfeit blades (and batteries, SD cards, etc.) on Amazon, so I've come to avoid buying these things here.However, these Dorco blades are legit. And the four-blade cartridges have improved a great deal. I bought a pack of the six-blade cartridges also, but haven't opened them up yet. The old six-blade units lasted for a maximum of six shaves, starting to give too much drag after four shaves. I'm using the first new four-blade unit after six shaves and it still feels good. It is exhibiting very little resistance! I'm glad I restocked with these. They are indeed the real deal.",
