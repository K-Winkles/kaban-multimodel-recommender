I've used razors like this (screw on) and I've used butterflies. I like butterflies for convenience, but screw ons shave better in my opinion. Also, I've had butterflies come loose once or twice. More than enough to know I don't want to do it another time.This razor sits in my stubby sausage fingers just fine. I am able to swap blades with ease. And clean us is a breeze.Out of the 9 or so safety razors I have purchased, I would put this top 2 easily. And I would order this same stick again.",

                "reviewText": "Was used to the cartridge razors and because i got ingrown hair and irritation i began using a electric shaver/trimmer but it never gave me a smooth shave. When i used this razor the first time, of course with caution and a good shaving soap, i got the best shave ever ZERO irritation and no ingrown hairs. A pack of 5 Astra superior platinum costs $0.6 at my local convenience store. A month has passed and i still have 2 blades left. I use 1 blade almost 5 times before i change it out. For 9 bucks this is the best investment ever.",

                "reviewText": "It is an entry-saver that gives you an average cut. Please know that if you just move from a regular commercial shaver to a single one like this one, your face will go through a period of adaptation. Do not expect that you may not have a minor cut or irritated spot, etc. Your face skin needs to get used to it like we get used to new shoes by wearing them. I like that it is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to maintain. Blades sit correctly in the enclosure, instructions are easy, it is not too heavy to use, and once you get used to it, it is fairly comfortable to handle. It is not bad for the practice, however, once I get used to it I plan to buy something better in regards to the hair closeness. It is a good first start for anybody trying to drop the commercial shavers who are growing your hair under your skin.",

                "reviewText": "My go-to DE shaver is the Merkur 34C combined with either the Gilette Platinum or the Perma-Sharp DE blades, but I\u2019m not above trying a new shaver and I was curious how this shaver would compare.The first thing I noticed about this DE shaver when I took it out of the package was that, despite it having a longer handle than my Merkur, it was actually lighter. Comparing the two on a kitchen scale, it turned out that this shaver weighs 1.7 oz and the Merkur came in at 2.8 oz (both with a blade installed).The blade was fairly easy to install, but taking it out after shaving was a tad bit more difficult as the blade stuck to the shaver due to the water that got in between. I had to be really careful not to cut myself while taking it out. Personally, I feel that this happened due to the design of the shaver, as you need to disassemble both the bottom and the top of the head instead of having the bottom of the head still attached to the handle when you take out or insert the blade. In the case of the latter, you\u2019d be at much less risk of cutting yourself.Shaving with this razor was easy enough. While I prefer a bit more weight to my shaver, I was able to get a decent shave out of it. That being said, I do feel the blades that come along with this razor are fairly aggressive and I had to be a lot more careful than normal not to give myself a nick. However, once I placed a Gilette Platinum DE blade into the razor, the aggressiveness was no longer an issue. While this razor is marketed as a beginner-friendly razor, the blades kind of take that away and I would suggest any beginner looking into this razor to buy a set of different blades to go along with it (my suggestion would be to get a sampler pack, so you can figure out which one you like).This shaver comes in decent packaging, with thank-you stickers on the top and bottom as a way to seal the package. Unfortunately, the glue had given out on the side, which made it possible to take out the shaver and blades without breaking the seals. A third sticker on the side would be nice, as to create another seal in case the glue gives out.While I will keep my Merkur as my go-to DE shaver, this DE razor is definitely a nice one and I will keep it as my travel razor.",
