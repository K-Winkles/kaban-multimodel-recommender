I am doing that because the price I was seeing at the warehouse store for my favorite 5 bladed razors had at least doubled to a whopping $47 from just a few years ago. At present, Harry's 5 bladed razors came in around $2 a blade as compared to those other quality blades at $4. So far, there is no drop off from the really great close shaves I am used to. I rated Harry's at just four stars today because I do not know the longevity scenario yet. I have only had two shaves with this (new to me) product. If the long run matches or exceeds the other product, I will report back with five stars. I have seen other reviews that said it does. If so, \"good on you\" Harry's...",
