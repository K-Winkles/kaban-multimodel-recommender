Now, I only use a new blade a month, at most (sometimes twice as long!) Doing the calculations, I have found I've saved over $500 not buying disposable plastic razors! PLUS the added planet benefit of not putting plastic in a landfill! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS RAZOR!!!",

Nada del otro mundo pero si al principio te cortas o no logras el rasurado que deseas no te desanimes, la pr\u00e1ctica hace al maestro.

Only cons are the blades seemed thin and bent. I'm also new to single blade razors so I don't know if that's normal. Other con is how the stand has no type of padding in where the razor goes so if put in roughly I can see the razor getting scratched and scuffed. Other than that I love it and will keep it as my daily",
