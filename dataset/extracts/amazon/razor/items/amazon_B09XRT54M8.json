I used to use the Schick pink disposable razors & really loved them but could only find them at K-Mart (my local store went out of business & closed down) or on Amazon (I can\u2019t find them anymore). I\u2019m thinking they may be discontinued. I actually started to use nair (too messy for me) because I detest the big bulky razors they sell everywhere that don\u2019t get into hard to reach or small crevices well. Then I found this razor! I couldn\u2019t be happier. Small, thin lined, light weight, with a moisturizing razor blade feature (just like the pink ones) & the ease of maneuverability that is very important to me in a shaving utensil. I pray this razor never gets discontinued. Most other disposable razors are just way too bulky or thin & too cheaply made with too little razor blades & no moisturizing strip.",
