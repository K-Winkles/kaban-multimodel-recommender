                "reviewText": "I would have done ANYTHING to have known this nickel-free razor was out there. I have a severe nickel allergy that I had never considered to be a culprit of the problems I have had for YEARS with shaving. I absolutely have never been able to shave my legs without scratching them raw from the itch that I experience the hours following a shave. I'm talking years of itching, ingrown hairs, and discomfort. I even ditched shaving and switched to waxing for the relief. But waxing can be an expensive pain. Once I realized that the blade itself on most razors is often made of nickel or nickel plated, i started to research. Preserve razors were the only ones that popped up consistently in reviews and searches for nickel-free blades. Y'all! It's like the heavens opened up and the angles handed me this razor because they were tired of me having half hairy legs (I'm a mom of 3, waxing is the last thing on my priority list!). I LOVE shaving my legs now. I never thought I'd say that in my entire life! I've used it consistently for a month now and NO ITCHING! I'm so grateful to the makers of this razor! <3",

I have a severe nickel allergy, and somehow never thought about razors having nickel in the blades (which most razors do). But not these! After nearly 20 years struggling with very irritated skin after shaving, and trying everything to remedy the issue, I was told about these razors and I fell in LOVE! I can now shave anywhere with no irritation at all. The fact that they are inexpensive is just a bonus. I do wish they were more widely available in retail settings, but for now I will keep ordering them online for as long as they are manufactured. And I pretty much tell everyone with nickel allergies or sensitive skin about these amazing razors.Note: Definitely get the 5 blade system, it is much sturdier than the 3 blade system and a better shave overall.",

                "reviewText": "I switched to this razor hoping to be a bit more \"green\" and reduce my personal waste but unfortunately, this product is not as eco-friendly as I had hoped. The only thing made from recycled material is the handle. The blades themselves are not made from recycled material nor are they recyclable through normal municipal programs and preserve does not offer a recycling program for their products. Seeing as I already had a refillable razor handle that used similar non-post consumer material, unrecyclable blades, all this purchase has done is create extra waste I could have avoided simply by sticking with the brand I was already using. On top of that, this brand's razor blades deliver a subpar shave. I have sensitive skin but despite that have never really struggled with razor burn, these blades, however, drag against the skin and make it very irritated. Even with a completely fresh blade, I broke out on my legs after one use. Forget multiple uses when they're this dull to begin with. My previous razor I could use between 4-6 shaves (underarms and legs) before it was too dull and I had to trash it so really all this \"green\" razor has done for me is create more unrecyclable waste.I was quite disappointed in this outcome as I expected more from preserve after having great success with their toothbrushes.",

There's a tiny piece that keeps coming lose, but I'm sure I could glue it down.Other than that, the handle lasts for a long time, it's easy to grip and never slips out my hands.The only downside is, the razors they provide are still not good for my skin, but they're the best I can find. My nickel allergy is so extreme, anything will make me break out, and I get ingrown hairs so badly no matter the razor.Wish it could be a bit cheaper initially, but for how long it has lasted me, I can't really complain that much. The refills I wish were cheaper since those go way faster.Otherwise, I totally recommend this product if you have sensitive skin and want to stop using name brands who put a bunch of garbage in their razors.",

I learned that Preserve was not only cruelty-free, but also made of recycled materials, so I was so excited to support them! The new/fresh blades are super sharp, so my underarms were a bit irritated at first after so many years of using duller razors but that went away after the first couple uses. The razor didn't come with a protective cover, unless you count the original packaging which is definitely sturdy enough for travel, so I wouldn't be comfortable tossing it in my checked luggage (I recycled the original packaging because it was a bit bulky for my taste and I just don't need the extra clutter). I am definitely a converted customer and will be purchasing replacement blades from Preserve in the future!",

                "reviewText": "Fiiiirst of all, it works really well. I have thick hair that is deeply structured in my DNA to genetically protect my people from the hot desert sun for another 1000 years. I've tried so many razors that just don't cut it (literally) and it's irritating beyond all measure that a woman's razor is designed for dainty butterfly peach fuzz and not the realistic closet yeti's we are. These get a close, smooth leg and other parts shave. The handle is light but it's sturdy and the blades are top notch. I've always needed to use men's razors and even then, they are expensive and have zero thought for the environment. I love the sustainability factor of this brand, that they are cruelty-free, are using recycled material, can also BE further recycled and their commitment to reshaping the identity of a razor for just plain normal hairy people. Yes, yes yes to this.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this razor specifically because it's vegan/cruelty-free (the moisture bar) and it's made of recycled plastic. It still isn't as great as a completely zero-waste razor (in terms of waste) but I've heard too many horror stories with those to give it a try right now. This is an awesome compromise! The 5 blade one is WAY better than the 3 blade one - don't buy the 3 blade to save money - it feels WAY cheaper and doesn't give a good shave, at all. This one is great! Would definitely recommend.",
