Most cheap razors cut your skin but these ones don't which is good. They do dull quicker than the normal expensive razors but that's expected for how cheap they are. We change the blades once a week and have no issues. Would highly recommend these razors if your looking for a good cheaper blade that you don't mind changing weekly.",

                "reviewText": "I've been shaving for over twenty years and have used all kinds of razors. If you're thinking about buying this razor you should give it a try. It is priced right so you don't have much to lose. At first I thought 6 blades were overkill. I had already tried the Pace 3 and Pace 4 and liked them both. So I wanted to try the razor that appeared to be Dorco's best effort.The 6 blades do not irritate my skin. There seems to be something about the design that protects the skin from irritation, but I can't explain it. They are very good for mowing down thick stubble. I find I can rinse it off less frequently because those 6 blades just keep doing the job. They don't drag, just glide. I can even shave with slower strokes and they just glide through the stubble. They never get clogged even when I am using a thick pre-shave oil. They always rinse clean with ease. I've had other razors clog up, but not these. The blades also give this great audio feedback when the stubble is being cut. So when I'm in the shower stall and using a clear cream like Cremo, I can hear what is going on even if it is hard to see. I love this feature.The trimmer works great. It takes a little getting used to (as all new razors do) but I find it works better then the Fusion. I found the original Fusion trimmer clogged up bad. This trimmer doesn't clog. Once I got used to the angle and pressure needed, it worked very well.I have a thick coarse beard and have used this razor 10 times and it is still shaving like new. I predict I will get many more shaves out of this first cartridge.Also I believe that a shave with any razor will be bad if you don't prep your skin well. The right products and technique will make the most difference in a shave. But even in the instances when I didn't have time for a hot shower, pre-shave oil, premium cream or any of the nice things a home shave gets me, this razor performed well enough. A quick spash of hot water in the sink, and some canned shave gel still got the job done without incident. So the razor passed the test even in my worst case scenario of shaving.If there are any negatives about this razor I would say it is the size of the cartridge. The trimmer solves most of the size issues. However sometimes shaving around the curve of my chin the rubber guard and lubrication strip wouldn't make contact with my skin and the razors would be the only part making contact and nick. Yet I got used to it very quickly and am not having an issue with it. As with any new razor, I find as I got more used to the razor the shaves got better and better. My recent shaves have all been nick free and very close.",

Al ver el producto vi la marca real. No le pongo 5 estrellas por que su cabezal no es movil, pero definitivamente con menos pasadas quedas mejor que la Gillette match ultra de 5 navajas, y el precio es mas atractivo. Solo es cosa de acostumbrarse a darle pasadas rectas de nuevo y asi no te irritas.",
