As someone with sensitive skin, finding the right razor that balances effectiveness with comfort has always been a challenge, but BIC Comfort 3 exceeds all expectations.What sets this razor apart is its three-blade design, which effortlessly glides over my skin, providing a close and smooth shave with each stroke. The blades are sharp yet gentle, ensuring a precise cut without causing irritation or razor burn, even on sensitive areas.The ergonomic handle is another standout feature of this razor. Its rubberized grip provides excellent control and maneuverability, allowing for a comfortable and secure hold during shaving. I no longer have to worry about the razor slipping from my grasp, even when my hands are wet.One of the best aspects of the BIC Comfort 3 razor is its refillable design. Instead of disposing of the entire razor after each use, I can simply replace the cartridge, which not only reduces waste but also saves money in the long run. It's a win-win solution that I can feel good about.Overall, I can't recommend the BIC Comfort 3 Refillable Three-Blade Disposable Razor enough, especially for those with sensitive skin. It combines exceptional performance with comfort and convenience, delivering smooth shaves with ease. Say goodbye to shaving woes and hello to a new level of comfort with BIC Comfort 3!",

When this balm loses its moisture, it is time to change the blade. Each blade provides about 4 smooth shaves after which you need to change the blade as it starts to become painful while shaving. All in all, I am happy with these and I have been using these for the last 4 years at least. I don't plan to change any time soon.",

I did get them on sale and just having to switch out the blade as opposed to a whole new razor is nice but I won\u2019t purchase these again in the future.",
