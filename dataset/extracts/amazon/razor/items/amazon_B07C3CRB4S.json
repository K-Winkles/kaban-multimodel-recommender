These are much lighter than the one I've been using that only requires new cartridges, but you get used to the new weight in about 2 minutes. Same close shave as cartridges I've bought.I've tried options with more blades, but I find 2 to be plenty for me... in fact more seem to irritate my skin. You need some space to store the box, but other than that, these are a good bargain.",

I've been using these razors for over 5 years and have no reason to change.",
