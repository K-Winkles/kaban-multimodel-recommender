                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t like moisture strips in razors as a rule because they irritate my sensitive skin and are usually gummy and hard to rinse off. But this one is all natural and feels like it\u2019s actually good for my skin! The razor gives a great close smooth shave and the very low environmental impact is a win for me.",

                "reviewText": "When I first opened up my package, I was confused. What was did little paper brown baggie at the bottom of my bag? *looks around* The paper housing is super thin, barely there but does an excellent job at housing the product. Environmentally friendly down to the packaging. The blades are constructed in Mexico from what I read on the paper bag. And let me tell you these blades are SO smooth and SO perfectly aligned that you will question if you are shaving anything or not. I have extremely thick hair and every time I shave its like sandpaper, I have to go over the area a few times in EVERY direction because apparently I grow FUR and my hair follicles grow in 3s, its a mess to say the least. But I was pleasantly surprised... albeit also extremely cautious at what a close and smooth shave this is. Be very careful as this razor is NO joke but will be your new best friend!",

Now I have to wait for the refills because I do not trust the razor it came with. If the razors come in a similar way, I will not use them and will not order this product again. Nor will I recommend this product.",
