I did not like her reaction and distrust when she is the one that did the distrustful acts. Almost stopped reading it at that point. Stupid does make a good story.

                "reviewText": "Laura may not have seemed so idiotic if there would have been a little more reasoning in her past to support her so called trust issues with men. If anything her trust issues stemmed from her mother moving on so quickly. I found myself shaking my head a lot at her ridiculous decision making rationalisations. All of this was surprising because the female characters in previous books were better written.",

                "reviewText": "I liked that this book had a slow burn introduction to Razor and Laura and showed them together as a couple before she ran away, often these tropes start with them meeting back up and don\u2019t cover back story - in this book I thought they was invaluable and endeared the characters to me a little more, which was a good thing as though I enjoyed the book overall, Laura did grate on me somewhat with her doubts and aspersions over Razor, and her inability to process her own feelings and thoughts without letting others impact it.I thought Razor was overall patient and kind, with a slight dark edge (not too much, very much less than any other character in the series so far, in fact he was probably by far the \u201csoftest\u201d of the MC)A not wholly unpredictable yet still enjoyable book with lots of romance, brotherhood and danger but not dark at all in relative terms to the MC genre in general.I received a free copy of this book via Booksprout and am voluntarily leaving a review.",
