These three bladed razor refills for men are equipped with an improved lubrication strip that adds a smooth glide to your shave. Along with durability, these three bladed razor refills feature an upgraded lubrication strip (vs previous Mach3) for enhanced glide to help protect your skin from redness during shaving. The Lubrastrip also fades when you are no longer getting an optimal shave. Designed for your comfort, the razor blade refills are equipped with soft micro fins that gently stretch and smooth skin, preparing hairs to be cut for the optimal shaving experience. Gillette Mach3 razor blade refills feature three DuraComfort blades and an Open Blade Architecture for easy rinsing to keep your razor blades clean and performing their best. Each razor blade refill is engineered to last up to fifteen comfortable shaves, so you can get the most of every shave. Pairs perfectly with Gillette\u2019s Series Shaving Gel for added protection from shaving irritation. Concerned your Gillette handle won't fit? All of our Mach3 razor blades fit all Mach3 razor handles.",
