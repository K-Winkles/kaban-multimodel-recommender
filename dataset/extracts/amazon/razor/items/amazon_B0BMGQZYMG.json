Sorry, I've used the Gillete's for years and every time I try something else, I just don't find they work as well. Ok, what I do like is the handle and style of these razors. They are excellent. What I don't like is the feel of the blades. They have some pull and are not as smooth as the Gillete razors. They also don't seem to last for as many shaves. I give 4 stars!",
