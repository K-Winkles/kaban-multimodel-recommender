I have to say, this is one of the most amazing razors ive ever tried. Not only does it look as good as in the photos, it gave me a super smooth shave as well. I did not have razor bumps or any cuts on my face that I usually would get when I use those multiblade razors. It's generally easy to learn to shave with this and I really enjoyed this one. Would recommend to anyone.",

                "reviewText": "This is a really nice set. At first I thought it would be like all the other cheap razors you see on Amazon. But it's slightly different. The ends of the head extend out past the edge of the blade. So you don't have a sharp edge hanging out where it could nick an ear. The finish is really nice. I have a polished chrome look. It also come with a matching stand, and that is something just a little nicer than the rest. I found it to be a mild yet efficient shave. A razor that a beginner could use comfortable without a fear of getting cut, but still have impressive results.The one thing that I wasn't impressed with. Maybe I just got a bad one, but as you thread the handle onto the head, the threads are really, really loose. When you have the handle threaded about half way up, it should be pretty solid. But on this razor, there is a lot of side to side movement in the threads. The handle does snug up to the head and hold the head firmly. But the threads are not mated well and I feel that in the long run, this will be the fail point in this razor. The good news is that it has a standard thread and if the threads in the handle strip, you can buy a replacement handle from any of your favorite shave shop.All in all, this would make a great gift pack, or a great razor for someone just wanting to get started in wet shaving.",

                "reviewText": "This is a truly decent set. At first I figured it would resemble the wide range of various modest razors you see on Amazon. However, it's somewhat unique. The finishes of the head reach out past the edge of the cutting edge. So you don't have a sharp edge hanging out where it could scratch an ear. The completion is truly great. I have a cleaned chrome look. It likewise accompany a matching stand, and that is something somewhat more pleasant than the rest. I viewed it as a gentle yet effective shave. A razor that a novice could utilize agreeable without a feeling of dread toward getting cut, yet have noteworthy outcomes. This is a pleasant razor set. It feels great made - quite strong with a decent weight to it. The knurling is simply alright it should be more forceful or profound so you get a superior hold on it. I utilized it at the sink and despite the fact that it wasn't slipping a lot, I could perceive it would assuming I involved it in the shower. Is it terrible? However, no, simply alright. The razor looks truly pleasant spotless, exemplary lines. The stand is a smart idea and is helpful - simply be cautious where you put it in the event that it has an edge in it. I utilized one of the included cutting edges and got a decent shave with it. I would agree that it's a move forward from a fledglings' shave, yet not to an extreme. I didn't have to make a lot of passes with it. It's taken care of well indeed - this is giftable to any wet shaver you might be aware. I believe it's somewhat on the expensive side. I can imagine many razors I have that are less expensive (exactly significantly less expensive) that shave basically the same while perhaps worse. However, they may not come bundled too or accompany the stand. Thus, generally speaking, I like this razor and am content with it. This razor has an incredible load to it. The cutting edges are not difficult to introduce, and it accompanies 5 cutting edges. the handle has a great grasp to it, and doesn't slip around once it gets wet and loaded with shaving cream. Has a pleasant weighted base and arrives in a decent magnet close box. This is the conventional monitors razor, and is so very much assembled that it will endure forever. I actually accept that the straight razor is the best shave rather than the four sharp edge plastic ones. This would be an incredible gift for any man.",
