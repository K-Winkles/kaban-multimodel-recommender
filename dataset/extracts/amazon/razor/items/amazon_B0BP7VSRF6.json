I kept getting razor burn and ingrown hairs and then saw someone on TikTok talking about this razor and how inexpensive the refills are compared to the modern razors. I LOVE my new razor. There is a definite learning curve with shaving with this type of razor and I\u2019ve nicked myself a handful of times. But I\u2019m getting used to it. I haven\u2019t yet gotten razor burn or noticed any ingrown hairs.The razor also has a bit of weight to it too so that\u2019s another thing part of the learning curve. The blades seem flimsy when you are putting the razor together, but they are definitely sharp.10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a good razor.",

                "reviewText": "To preface: I'm female.Razors such as this are typically thought of as old fashioned and strictly for men.Not so anymore!I was so tired of shaving with cartridge razors, or worse, disposables. I felt like I was just spending money to throw away.Now, there's no plastic to toss into the landfill. This kit comes with 10 blades and they last a while. But buying 100 blades was super cheap.The blades are stainless steel so there's no worry of rust.Whenever the blade pulls or irritates my skin I just remove it from the razor handle and put them in a lidded mason jar. Many years from now, when the jar becomes full, I can take it to a metal recycling place to be melted down and used for a new purpose.If you're on the fence about this, please trust me.It has a slight learning curve, but as long as you don't press it hard into your skin you should be okay. After that it's so easy to use.",

                "reviewText": "I dont even normally write reviews, but I felt like I had to for this one. This is by far the worst razor I've ever used. Like as in, my Walgreens brand razor does a better job. I bought this thinking it was gonna change my life because I have pcos and my hair grows fast but no, not only did this not give me a close shave, it cut my legs so bad that two days later they are still burning, and I already have stubble. Also, I really did give this razor a fair try, I used it three times using different angles and shaving cream and I even watched YouTube videos to see if I was doing it right. However, this last time, I changed out the blade thinking maybe that was the problem, but that new blade was worse.",

                "reviewText": "I am a lady who uses DE razors the last few years for legs and body, etc to cut down on buying all the plastic razors. I started out with a rose gold baili butterfly DE razor that has just started to rust after 5 years.I received this and was pleasantly surprised at how heavy it was, and the length of handle made it even easier to shave the legs.I use vokshod and wilkinson blades, but the ones that came with this worked nicely also! Not too aggressive and just sharp enough for a close shave. Highly recommend ladies!!!!!",

Con buena t\u00e9cnica y una buena espuma, la irritaci\u00f3n es m\u00ednima. Eso s\u00ed; prepare bien la cara y usen abundante espuma.Cuidado* - El rastrillo es un tanto agresivo. Si nunca has usado rastrillo cl\u00e1sico antes, procura cuidar el \u00e1ngulo, la presi\u00f3n, y s\u00f3lo hacer movimientos rectos. De lo contrario, puede dejar un sinf\u00edn de cortadas en la cara. Aunque la curva de aprendizaje es moderada, vale la pena ya que la final te deja afeitados de primer nivel, con la piel super suave.Las navajas originales son super filosas, cortan con gran facilidad, pero no patinan para nada sobre piel seca o ligeramente seca. Las compar\u00e9 con unas Feather - Las Feather no tienen tanto filo, pero patinan mucho m\u00e1s; cosas de gustos.En general, el kit me parece fabuloso, a buen precio, super recomendable si quieres entrar al mundo del rastrillo cl\u00e1sico.",
