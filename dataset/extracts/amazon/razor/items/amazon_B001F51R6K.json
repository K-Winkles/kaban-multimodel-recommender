                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Still the Best Twin Blade Cartridge Made. (UPDATE!)",
                "reviewText": "(UPDATE: First; I've done a comparison for my own use and find that the Trac II blades out perform my D/E razor as well as a 3 and 4 blade razor I recently tried. In short; no other razor blade comes close to giving me the shave that the Gillette Trac II does and I'm done experimenting: Sticking with the Trac II. Glade Gillette has resumed production of this razor and blade and is importing it to the U.S. from their St. Petersberg Russia Gillette plant.Next: I have a theory... Remember when we older Trac II people used to complain that the twin blades would clog? What I'm finding is when I used shaving soap and brush; either shaving soap in a mug or shaving soap in a tube or a shaving stick, the Trac II blades never clog. I can swish the razor's head in my sink of water and the blades come out clean every time with no effort. When I used a can of foam and also gel shaving cream the twin blades clogged. They clogged worse with the canned foam than the gel. The gel was easier to rinse out with full power water coming from the sinks tap; but clogged all the same. With canned foam (like Barbersol and Gillette Foamy) the twin blades clogged like they used to. I'm wondering if the CBC's and Silicone in the foam form a glue like substance and bond the beard stubble together and glue the clump to the blades...? But with brush and mug soap or tube or stick soap never a clog and also the blades seem to last longer; from 6 shaves per blade to 8-9. I change my blades early as I'm picky about the quality of my shave and have sensitive, nick-cut-and-irritation prone skin so if not for that I might get 10+ shaves with the blades. Just a thought so if you have a problem with twin blades clogging try switching to a brush and mug or stick or tube shave cream and see if that helps. IN FACT I remember in the mid 1970's the shaving brush and mug came back into popularity and I wonder if that's not why...? Anyway; love these blades and love the Trac II.)The Trac II blades I received were made in Poland; most of Gillette's blades are made in Eastern Europe now and has not reduced the quality of these historically famous blades. I haven't shaved with a Gillette Trac II blade since the late 1970's because of the price increase and switched to drug store versions and thought 'why not?' when I saw these at a good price. Still the best. So far my favorite twin blade cartridge blade is the Supermax S-II blades as they are incredibly sharp, smooth shaving and long lasting (about 8 - 10 shaves per blade for me) and dirt cheap, made in India. But my first shave the the original shocked me. There's no comparison between the real thing and the aftermarket copies. The Gillette is the smoothest, perhaps the sharpest of the bunch I've used and as in the past, a two-way shave with a few minor touch-ups and no razor burn. Now in all honestly; I have sensitive skin and get really bad razor burn so my definition of 'razor burn' is a little different. If after I apply some Lubraderm the skin cools down and the redness goes away within a few minutes I count that as 'no razor burn'; as opposed to having a raw face that actually is painful to the touch and aches all day like with a D/E razor. So no razor comes close in comfort as compared to the Schick Hydro 3 I use on 'bad face days'; but I don't expect it to. But I will say the Gillette Trac II comes in a close second to the Schick Hydro 3 and beats it hands down for not leaving any stubble or stray hairs. The Hydro does miss some beard no matter how many times I go back for touch-up and the Trac II gets it all down to 'baby butt smooth' every time.The quality of these blades are beyond debate; they are the best of the twin blade cartridges hands down. The only competition the Gillette Trac II ever really had were the Schick Super II adjustable and the Schick Ultrex as both were stainless steel with both platinum and Teflon coating. Otherwise now the only blades that come close are the Supermax S-II's and not a tie by any means as touch-up's will result in razor burn every time.But as good as these Gillette originals are it's the price that will send me back to the Supermax blades or looking for Schick Super II's online somewhere. They are mass produced overseas and by today's standards 'old tech' and there's no reason to price them as high as they do. You'd think the amount of competition with the hundreds of aftermarket choices would have an effect; but it doesn't. My third choice would be Personna's version (American made, very sharp but not smooth at all) but usually leaves me with 'raw-face' when done. I end up having to use the Hydro for a couple of days. I use traditional prep before every shave so I know my beard is ready for a shave; hence it has to be the blade. In the end the Gillette is still the best and I might stop quibbling over the difference in pennies and except that Gillette knows what it's got and in this case you really do get what you pay for: Best twin blade cartridge made. Ever. (unless Schick makes a come-back with the Super II and we all know that's never going to happen:) I'll go back to paying a little more for this blade now that I've experienced how big a difference there is.",
