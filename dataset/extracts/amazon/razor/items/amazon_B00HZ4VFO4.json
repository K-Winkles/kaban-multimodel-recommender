                "reviewText": "Before ordering this I had never used a razor blade like this and was sick of paying obscene amounts of money for replacement blades for my supposedly better 5 blade monstrosities. This is better in every way once you get the technique down.Pros:1. Its WAY cheaper.For the cost of one set of cartridges for my big name brand razor, I can get several years worth of blades for this one. Remembering to get razors at the store is a thing of the past.2. Its faster and easy to clean.Since its double edge, you can shave twice as much area before clearing the blades. Saves on water too! Cleaning is super simple and will prevent gumming up of the retention mechanism. Open it up, wash out all the hairs, blow dry it with a couple of puffs of air and put in a dry place. This should last forever if you do this.3. Better for travel.Small enough to fit my entire shave kit in the smallest pocket in my backpack.4. Closer shaveI can get closer with this blade with less risk of cuts than my old razor. Since the blades are so cheap, I don't feel obligated to keep using them well past the point when they should be replaced.Cons:1. You will probably nick yourself the first time you use this. I nicked myself a couple of times when I first started out with it. Nothing a little TP couldn't fix. After using this several times and perfecting my technique, this no longer happens. I haven't nicked myself in months. Just be careful around the chin and jaw line.2. As a few others have mentioned and because this gets so close, you will absolutely want to use aftershave. I did not use aftershave with my previous razors but your skin will be on fire if you don't when you use this. The upside is the shave does last a day longer for me. YMMV with this.3. You will need to use an upstroke or 2 around the nose. Because of its shape, its difficult to shave the spot right below your nose using downstrokes. I tend to avoid upstrokes due to the risk of ingrown hairs but that hasn't been a problem with this razor.",

It gives a smooth shave and isn't very difficult to use, even for a beginner like me. I haven't cut myself at all. One drawback is that I understand that the blades are not allowed in carry on baggage on planes. Of course Van Der Hagen can't be blamed for that.",

                "reviewText": "This was the 3rd safety razor purchased in the last 6 months through Amazon. I'm replacing all the plastic disposables in two households and one shop. My first razors as a 15 yr. old were my grandfather's Gillettes, so my first replacement razor was the current Gillette offered by Amazon. Then I bought another much cheaper brand's version, then this one which falls between the two in price. I like it the best of the three. It is balanced correctly and is rather light. The big deal here is the angle of the blade...the modern Gillette is a little shallow, the cheapie is too steep (but cuts like mad) and this one seems just right (for my beard and 'stache) The clam-shell arrangement is a little flimsy until you cinch it down, but is effective AND there's no annoying protrusion of the blade on the sides, a disappointing feature of the Gillette.",

                "reviewText": "I've struggled my entire life with razor burn, ingrown hairs, bumpy skin. I'm the poster boy for bad shaving experiences. I've spent most of my life using Gillette multi-blade razors or some variation on that. My mom alway's insisted that I had skin like my dad's and I should try a safety razor. Finally, after 25 years, I relented. I can't believe it took me so long!So I was fearful I would cut the living crap out of myself with this thing. I did, a little bit. Mostly on my neck where the hair seems to grow in 16 different directions. Eventually though, after about 4-5 shaves, I figured out the exact direction to cut to avoid bleeding all over the place. The razor itself is very simplistic to use. Just have to keep it at the right angle. Slow and steady strokes take a little getting used too. The razor doesn't adjust for your skin like the \"commercial\" ones do. Still, it only takes 5 minutes to shave. I've noticed a lot less skin irritation after I shave. I have only gotten one ingrown hair versus the 10 I typically get. The blades only seem to be really good for about 2-3 shaves each. They are pretty cheap though. My buddy insists the blades from the dollar store are really great so I will probably give those a shot. The blades that come with this seem good quality. This razor was a lot cheaper on amazon than at my local store. I noticed it helps to have a less thick layer of shaving cream/gel/soap with this razor. Having a lot of cream makes me prone to not know exactly where I'm cutting and I think resulted in a few cuts on my initial shaves.If you are on the fence about trying a safety razor for the first time - go for it. I wish I hadn't waited so long to do so.",
