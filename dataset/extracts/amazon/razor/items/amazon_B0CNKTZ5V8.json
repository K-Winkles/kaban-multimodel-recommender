                "reviewText": "As mentioned in the headline, this razor lives up to all of the claims in its name. I do not like to shave more than a couple times per week, and my job does not care if I am not clean shaven. So, a razor that can shave through longer stubble, and not clog up is key for me.Pros -- I tested this razor after not shaving for 4-5 days and it provided a clean shave. It worked as well as razors I have with more blades, and probably better- As advertised, the razor did not clog. With longer whiskers, this can be an issue, but a quick rinse under normal tap water cleared the blades every time- The lubricating strips and easy clearing technology did their job, as I did not experience any razor burn or discomfort during or after shaving- You get 9 razor heads, so even an every-day-shaver will have enough replacement heads for roughly half a year if each one lasts the 20 shaves advertised.Cons -- Honestly at this point I do not have anything negative to review on this razor kit. It worked exactly as advertised, and better than expected. If you are looking for a good razor that will not clog even with longer stubble, and clears easily this is a great option.",

In other sets, the whole handle and blade is disposable so figure out which set you prefer before selecting this one.I compared the razors on this one to (2) older ones including a BIC and the blades have way more space between them For the old \"tight blade\" razors, they all have hair stuck in them. I'm only able to clean that by blowing when they are dry or by dragging them across a towel which reduces the lifespan. So their \"easy clean\" is TRUE in this case. It was easy to clean.Razors like these last forever for me (months) because I don't shave every day.I've never considered BIC for razors before last year due to the classic blue razors they made that cut your skin. But they reinvented themselves and made better products. Last year I began using one and it's worked great. I compared that to this and these BIC EasyRinse are even better.",

                "reviewText": "I use Keihl's shaving cream which is a denser, old-fashioned type that comes from a tube. It works well and I like it very much despite the fact that it is stickier than traditional creams that come from aerosol dispensers. These BIC EasyRinse razors do exactly what they say - they rinse much easier than the BIC razors I currently use, as the blades do in fact have more space between them. Performance-wise they do a great job and deliver a clean, close shave. And my Keihl's cream rinses out quickly and cleanly under running water, whereas with my current razor I often have to tap the head onto the sink to help get the cream out - a big improvement! The only slight downside is that the shaver cartridges are definitely bigger than my current razor, and require a bit more attention to maneuver around on my face. The cartridges do flex nicely so that isn't so much of an issue, and I'm quickly getting used to the size difference. A big bonus is that this set cost less per blade than my current razor, so from both the rinsing and cost perspective these EasyRinse razors are a win-win for me.",

                "reviewText": "I'm using this primarily as a back up razor in a small travel kit for overnights, weekends, or more. It does the job without any issues and provides excellent value just in that. I don't think I'd use this as a primary every day razor just because I have my preferred brand and usage but this is great for taking around when I don't want to pack my usual gear. It performs quite well, giving me a smooth shave with no irritation and has held up to being traveled with. The blades are indeed easy to rinse and don't clog so plus for an accurate description. Great value all around.",

It looks like with these they are trying something new and I think they got a winner.The price is still great at less than $1.50 a blade or even cheaper if you factor in the handle. They feel good on the face (no nicks or cuts) and the hair rinses out of the blades very easily.With all the new companies out there with discount blades such as Harry's and Dollar Shave club, these new BiC easily hold their own.",
