I was hoping that this new design was what I needed since it claims to stimulate the hair to stick up for a closer shave. I should have paid attention to all the reviews that say it gave them ingrown hairs and a terrible shave. I thought, those are probably men, and since I'll use it to shave my legs, the skin is different and might have a better effect. But no... I'm getting clogged, ingrown hair on my legs and still a rough shave. I've realized that there was probably nothing wrong with my old razor; Gillette seems to have just lowered the quality of their blades, no matter which razor you buy. I have used Gillette for 20+ years and never had these issues, but now it seems every razor/blade I try from them is just no good. More money wasted, and all I want is smooth legs again... I will be buying another brand from now on.",

                "reviewText": "As someone frequently traveling for business and presenting at various conferences, a reliable and high-performance razor is non-negotiable. Over the years, I've tried more than 20 different razors, including several flagship models from top brands and even a few from Gillette's own lineup like the Fusion 5. Against this background, I was pleasantly surprised by the Gillette Labs Razor Gold Edition.Pros:----Exceptional Razor and Handle: Gillette has outdone themselves with this razor. It feels great in hand and delivers an unparalleled shave experience. There's a testament to its quality - the built-in exfoliating bar ensures that the skin is free from dirt and debris, allowing for an effortless shave in just one efficient stroke.----Durability: One of the standout features for me was the blade's longevity. It's not just sharp for the first few times, but maintains its performance for weeks. This is a boon for someone like me, who's often away for 2-3 weeks at a stretch. No more blade changes in the middle of my trips!----Adaptive Design: The 2D FlexDisc design ensures that the razor contours to the face perfectly. This means every stroke is both comfortable and effective, even on the trickiest parts of the face.----Cost-Effective: Despite its high performance, it falls into one of the more affordable categories, making it a bang for the buck.The biggest drawback for this otherwise impeccable razor is its packaging. I found myself battling with the \"travel case,\" which was a fortress in itself. It took some hefty force with a screwdriver to get it open, a sentiment echoed by many other users. The magnetic stand, touted as a feature, lacked functionality and felt unnecessary.In essence, while the Gillette Labs Razor for Men with Exfoliating Bar Gold Edition shines where it truly matters - giving a close, comfortable shave - there are certain peripheral features that could be improved for a better overall experience. After addressing the packaging issue (a Human Factors Study would have been beneficial here), I would have no hesitation in awarding it a solid 5 stars. For now, it earns a deserving 4 stars from me!",

A few minor points to take care: The blas\u00e9 assembly makes the unpleasant noise due to the wobbling movement of the head, this could be easily avoided by using rubber/ soft elastomer guides. Another thing is about the travel container. It is a challenge to open and close it using the provided instructions. I had to make slits at the corners to open and close relatively easy.",
