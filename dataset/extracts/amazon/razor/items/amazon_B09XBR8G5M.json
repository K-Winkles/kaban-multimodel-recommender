After using and shaving for about 2 months, for the price, it\u2019s not too bad. The shaving cream is excellent, smells great and lathers great. I also like the blade cover. It helps to keep your Razor cleaner and less notable if you leave it out. My old Razor from this competitor looked noticeably better in down. Overall, a good razor and a excellent shaving cream! I would recommend anyone giving it one try!!\ud83d\udc4d. Good Job Harry!!!\ud83d\ude02",

So, I thought why not try Harry's razors. The best way to describe the experience is like comparing a Rolls Royce to a daily driver. The packaging is impressive. The razor is even better. My razor burn was reduced be about 90% with the first shave. I highly recommend this product.",
