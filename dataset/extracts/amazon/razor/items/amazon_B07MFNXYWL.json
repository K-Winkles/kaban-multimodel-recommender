With these razor heads, I can use them for some 4-6 WEEKS before having to change them, as opposed to another company that has remarkably the same product for EXPONENTIALLY more-and I get just over a week from it?!?!Of ALL the razors on the market that I have tried (and they were ALL \u201cpremium level razors/razor heads) I find that I get BEST shave with these\u2026without exception. Additionally, if you have \u201csensitive skin\u201d, in my experience, it does NOT irritate your face. I take a myriad of medications as ongoing treatment for cancer, which irritates my face/beard/neck\u2026but theses razors do NOT add any additional \u201ccomplications\u201d to the condition. I find them to be the MOST COMFORTABLE on the market, coupled with providing such an EXCELLENT shaving experience.",
