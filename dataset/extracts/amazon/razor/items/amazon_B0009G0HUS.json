        "description": "FEATHER has set the standard in manufacturing the sharpest and safest razor cutting blades in the industry. The FEATHER Texturizing Blade is unique in that it cuts hair in small sections, and only removes half of the hair, which creates volume and texture. The blade fits snug into the handle and does not chatter or move when cutting. Although surgically sharp, these blades are very safe for you and your client with its patented blade guard, which prevents the guard from moving and exposing the blade. This also prevents hair from clogging between the guard and blade. Changing the blade is easy and safe. When the blade gets dull, put the blade into the Blade Disposal Case (available as open-stock and included in all kits). To replace, slide the handle onto the new blade and remove from the blade dispenser. With our blade changing system, never touch the blade with your fingers. It is completely safe, easy and fast!",

I\u2019ve been doing hair for 13/14years and have always used Jatai and I\u2019ve never had an issue, they are so easy to use and cut the hair like better and shaves the neckline so smoothly ! These blades last a long time before going dull and i honestly have zero complaints. I will forever be buying these and will never make the mistake again to save a couple dollars for cheaper ones! 10/10",
