I have pcos AND sensitive skin so I have lots of thick dark hair and can\u2019t shave every day because my skin is sensitive. I end up needing to let it grow out for several days before I can shave again. I love that I can attack that disgustingness quickly with these blade. The blades last longer than the smoothing stuff they have on them so they are a good value. As long as the smoothing stuff is still on the blade,you don\u2019t need shaving cream. I can use these on my face as well as my legs. They are just the tried and true blades that I always return to after I\u2019vetried something new that will hopefully solve the horror of having man hair on my girl legs. They give a smooth shave and although they are more expensive than other blades, they are worth every penny because of the amount of injuries they save me. A quick and comfortable shave. I\u2019ve put these on subscription.",
