                "reviewText": "Schick, the best a (Wo)man can get! Way back when I was in High School, my mom would get me the girly razor brands. I remember cutting myself almost every time, because the blades were dull & it just wasn't constructed well. I'd have to go over and over the same area, and push down to get a clean, close (as much as possible anyhow) shave. However, as many of you know, once you get to college, no matter how many hours you work, you NEVER seem to have enough money.This led me to the Razor section at Meijer (a regional store like Wal-Mart, but they've been around here longer, their prices are better, and they treat their employees SO much better [my brother worked there]) looking at the refill cartridges for the women's razor was SO expensive, so I had 2 choices, a men's bundle-a razor with 4 extra cartridges, for almost HALF the cost of just a few women's cartridges, OR those lovely plastic disposables, that are akin to using a cheese grater on your legs! Thus began my relationship with Schick!Men's razors are made to be used on the most delicate & most visible place, his face, so they are constructed with more elasticity, (I'm not sure how to convey my next point, so I'll put it in terms that I hope will make sense:) where the razor head meets the cartridge, men's razors- and this Schick model is an EXCELLENT example- they've built it to be similar to the shock absorbers on your vehicle, the cartridge is able to move up & down, and tilt, so in addition to the wonderful moisturizing strip (Gillette's is good, but having tried MANY different styles, both Gillette AND Schick, I've found that THIS particular model has the best moisturizing strip & it lasts the longest,) the razor just glides across your skin like skis on fresh new snow!Every year I purchase one of these bundles, & it usually lasts the entire year. If you take care of your blades, they can last a long time! Don't store your razor IN the shower, that leads to rust, and not only will that decrease the life of the blade by making it dull, but you don't want to have to get a tetanus shot and stitches! Every few swipes, tap the side of the razor to try to shake loose any impacted hair, and when you're done, clean it out really good, (I find that a toothpick or q-tip work well,) for the same reason as above, if you leave those wet hairs all crammed in there, you're building a rust farm.I'm always happy with my bundle, but this year, with the sensitive skin & moisturizing components, this is the best razor I've ever had!",
