                "reviewText": "Bic has been a great shaving razor for me going from their Bic comfort 3 to Flex 3 and now Flex 4. They seem to have the perfect spacing and sharpness to shave my hard to control unwieldy beard that grows in all opposite directions. Every one of these blades shaves as close as can get it has been just a difference in comfort, razor burn, and some skin cuts that make the difference. The flex 3 was a HUGE improvement over the Comfort 3 in lessening the chance of skin cuts and razor burns. I have used the Flex 3 for the past 3 years. The flex 4 offers the same great shaving experience with the addition of less pressure and a MUCH better moisturizing strip. This razor is as every other bic razor shaves as close as it gets with much less chance of razor burn and cuts. I still say the Gillette Fusion is the best of them all but for 1/4 the cost you get the same shave but just have to be more careful you don't press down too much or you will get a cut or razor burn. With the Fusion you can just glide it over for a close comfortable shave at 4x the cost without any additional shaves. It's all about whether the cost is worth being how aware you are when shaving. I prefer the Bic flex 4 while being attentive while shaving but while in a huge hurry the Fusion is the better option but for the money and the same close shave Bic is better.",
