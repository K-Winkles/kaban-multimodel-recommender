                "reviewText": "The number one reason I bought these was PRICE. Considering you need approval from a lender to purchase razor blades these days, I thought this was a bargain, and I could not find a better deal at a store near me. Other reasons I like these blades are that the heads are small enough to use comfortably, and they are simply triple blades, nothing more. I can use my own shaving lubricant with them, and they work for me. I own the Venus Vibrance razor. Those blades were the same size as the original Venus, but they had a small lubricating strip on them. I liked the way those worked. I bought the razor years ago, and there is only one place recently (on Amazon, in fact) I have found the same replacement blades, but they are too expensive, and the there are shipping charges. Luckily, all the Venus blades are interchangeable on all the razors. That is what I like most about the Venus products. But most of the blades they are selling now have heads and lubricating strips that are so large it is ridiculous. I cannot imagine who participates in the Gillette focus groups that approves/asks for these new designs. I wish someone would pick me to participate in a focus group! Does anyone actually get a good shave with these new blades? I tried the Venus Spa, and that was a joke. After the first couple of shaves, the large moisture strips just start to break down and fall off. And the strips leave so much goo on your skin that the blades do not even have good contact with the skin. I have very light, fine hair on my legs, and I was not able to get a close shave with the Venus Spa blades. The heads were too large for me to use safely on the bikini area. Most of the other Venus blades are similar to those. The downside to these blades is that there are only 3 blades. It is not a problem for me, but I know a lot of people like the new 4 and 5 blade designs. I imagine if you have hair that is dense and coarse, the extra blades might give a closer shave. Maybe I would like more blades too, if someone could figure out how to put 5 blades on a smaller head. Until then, I will continue to use the smaller head, original Venus blades.",

                "reviewText": "They are overall decent quality. I downgraded to these after using the more premium venus smooth razors that were getting too expensive. These are definitely a little less smooth and comfortable than the more expensive brand but I can use them for a month before they get too dull. They remain still too expensive overall and I will be on the lookout for a similar replacement that is cheaper.",

                "reviewText": "I so happy to try my Gillette Venus! Thanks Gillette for my razor I did get this product for free but these are my true opinion's!The first thing I noticed was the \"close and clean in 1 stroke\" which we all look for in our razors.{When I used the razor it was defiantly true, It is very smooth.}On the back: 1. 3 blade smoothness2. A indicator strip- the blue strip fades away when you are no longer getting the optimal shave{ This is very appealing to me. I always wonder if my razor is done or if its just me! Since I just got the razor I will have to let you guys know a little later if it works!}3. Lubrastrip with a touch of Aloe for glide {I love Aloe!}So I am loving this razor so far, then I go to open it... Now it is ALWAYS a pain to get these things open! BUT!! These guys have changed the game, to open it you just squeeze the sides and pull in a few spots it was so easy! No scissors or husbands required.Once I got it open I saw that I also received a replacement cartridge, and that you can use any replacement except the Venues Simple.It was super easy to snap the blade on and it looks exactly as I expected. {they didn't beef if up on the packaging}Performance:The grip stood out while I was wetting the razor, it fit in my hand perfectly as if they measured my hand and built the razor just for me.They were not kidding when they said smooth! The Venus, is incredibly smooth and it shaved with ease! I didn't even use shaving cream.When I got out of the shower my legs were so soft I couldn't believe it.This is the BEST razor I have used in a long time! I normally don't use razors with only 3 blades because the cut is just not as clean.I actually switched to men's razors for a more comfortable shave. After trying this I will be using Gillette Venus, I feel the aloe really helped with the after shave relief. I may try there other refills but the Venus is perfect soo I might just stick with it for a while! :)",
