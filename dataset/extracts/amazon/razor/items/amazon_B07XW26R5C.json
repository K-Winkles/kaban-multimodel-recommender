While there is no set rule, you should replace your blades at the first sign of dullness or discomfort. Will shaving give me ingrown hairs or red bumps? An ingrown hair occurs when the end of a hair gets trapped underneath the skin, resulting in a little red bump. Ingrown hairs are caused by numerous factors, which is why some women might have a higher likelihood of getting ingrown hairs from shaving than others. There are a few tips to help reduce the likelihood of ingrown hairs when shaving. First is exfoliation. Use either a brush or exfoliation soap on your skin to remove any obstructions to a hair\u2019s growth. Second is to ensure your skin is hydrated by having a warm shower or bath. Last, use a razor with more than three blades and a shave prep, this way fewer strokes are needed.",

However, between using this style of razor and an rx lotion from my dermatologist, I've resolved the issue. Most of the more expensive razors have a bigger head, thus making it difficult to get into the crevices of the underarms so you continue to shave and damage the skin. These razors have a smaller head and can glide over the curves of the underarm with ease. I am very pleased to have found this product and hope Gillette makes them forever. Saved me $1000s of dollars.",

Even barging bin ones last a bit longer. However once used for shaving it provides a close shave that lengthens the time between shaving and is nice and smooth. No nics or cuts.",
