Apply a pre-shave oil (optional). 2. Lather: Apply shaving cream or gel to your face using a brush or directly with your hands. 3. Shave: Use a razor to shave in the direction of hair growth, using short and light strokes, rinsing the razor frequently. For a closer shave, you can reapply shaving cream/gel and shave against the grain (opposite direction of hair growth). However, be cautious as this may increase the risk of skin irritation or ingrown hairs. 4. Soothe: Rinse your face, pat dry, and apply an aftershave lotion or balm to moisturize and soothe the skin. 5. Store: Shake off excess water after use and store your razor in a clean, dry place.",

These cartridges fit perfectly onto my Amazon Basics razor handle, making it incredibly convenient to swap them out when needed.The five blades provide a close and precise shave, leaving my skin feeling incredibly smooth without any irritation or nicks. The dual lubrication ensures a comfortable glide with each stroke, reducing friction and allowing for a seamless shaving experience.What I appreciate most about these refills is their longevity. Each cartridge lasts for several shaves, which makes this pack of eight cartridges an excellent value for the price. I no longer have to worry about constantly purchasing replacement cartridges, as this pack keeps me stocked up for months.Overall, I highly recommend the Amazon Basics 5-Blade Razor Refills to anyone looking for a reliable and affordable shaving solution. Whether you're a daily shaver or someone who prefers a few times a week, these cartridges deliver consistent and impressive results every time.",

Convenience is lame anyway.Next, they switched up their blades and handle to a cheap, flimsy, and easy-to-break knockoff of what they once were.Okay, now on to the best thing about this razor. SINGLE PASS GOODNESS! Whether taming the Netherglades or cleaning up the back 40, this baby has you covered. No more attempting thirty different angels to try and catch that one spot that reminds me of my ex-husband - short, inconvenient, and prickly.I will be purchasing a second handle for my husband and we\u2019ll be adding this to our Amazon subscription service !",

                "reviewText": "What matters in buying a razor - 1) Quality of the shave. I haven't found a razor better than Gillette that give a close, smooth shave. These Amazon Basic blades do a pretty good job, but I suspect that those who have a burly beard (I don't) will be disappointed in their shave. 2) Price. Gillette charges an excessive price for their blades. Not worth the cost for me. These are very reasonably priced. 3) How long the blades stay sharp. So far I've found these to be rather inconsistent in how long they last. But on a whole have lasted about as long as I would expect from a blade. 4) Mechanism for mounting the blades on the razor. The blades easily mount on the Amazon Basic razor handle. I had another off-brand razor that I tried and within a few months the mounting mechanism would break down and I'd have to buy a new razor handle. Hopefully this one holds up. So far, no problems.",

Not as good as the discontinued Executive blades from DSC were but DSC decided to switch us all to cheap pos blades so I dropped them. I ordered these not expecting much. These are good for max 2 shaves each but at a cost point that I use a new blade each shave and still save a ton. I'd recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I figured these would be as good as Harrys but cheaper.I was wrong. When I got them, I wanted to compare them with Harrys. My first test was to run them dry down one cheek. I used a Harrys blade that was at about the end of it's life. The old Harrys blade ran smoothly across the skin, even against the grain. I actually do dry shave with Harrys when in a hurry, and I've never gotten so much as a nick.I tried the brand new Amazon blade and it repeatedly caught on hair. Even with shaving cream, it does not provide a smooth shave for me.There is no question in my mind now that Harrys is worth the extra money.The difference in quality is apparent too. Harrys blades are clearly much sharper. Looking closely at the two blades, I notice the Amazon individual blades were uneven. One seeme to have a slight curve in it. I'm sure this variance accounts for some of the hair pulling. The Harrys individual blades are perfectly even.The Amazon blades are not bad. I'll use up the ones I ordered. I just have to shave a bit differently with them so as not to catch the blade on my beard.But after that, I'm going back to Harrys. Do yourself a favor and compare whatever blade you use to Harrys.",

Saves smoothly, no razorblade burn, no Knicks. Extremely comfortable shave. Blades don't as long as Harry's, but these are cheaper. I will be using this razor for a long time to come. Highly recommend to everyone looking for a great shaving experience.",
