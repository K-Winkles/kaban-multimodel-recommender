I thought maybe that's good, it pulls and lift the whisker out then cuts it's off close? my 2nd shave using the same razor nicked my face on my chin and above my lip near my cheek area. I'm not happy, I know how to handle a razor and I able to shave my neck chin and face in record time, I shave everyday and some times twice in one day without ever cutting my face. So what is going on with these crappy razors? Gillette may put their name on it because their just plain greedy or something but as far as I'm concerned these are a cheep knock off and should be sold as such. please listen if buying these basically think of then as a no name knock off. I most likely will continue to buy a 3 blade Gillette razor but never these green ones.",
