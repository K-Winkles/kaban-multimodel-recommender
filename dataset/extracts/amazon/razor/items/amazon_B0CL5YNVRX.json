                "reviewText": "Great product. I bought one almost two years ago with a new safety razor and 110 blades. It's still got room for more now that I have to buy more blades. It's getting tight though -- I suppose that is mathematically possible given the dimensions of this container and those of the blades, but no, you're not going to actually get 300 blades into this thing unless you can line up everything perfectly without seeing inside of it. I expect that I'll get up to about 120-130 or so before I switch to the new replacement container I'm buying today.Regarding the complaints that this is not openable -- it's not supposed to be. The whole point of this product is to provide a reasonably cheap ($3/year in my case) way to store razor blades and dispose of them safely in bulk. I don't want this to be openable or reusable. By that standard, the product meets all my expectations. While I suppose it may be possible to shake this thing in such a manner as to get a razor to fall or stick out of the slot, you'd almost have to be intentionally trying to do that for it to actually happen.Overall one of my favorite little Amazon purchases. I'm buying my second one today after two years and hope it's still available two years from today.",

                "reviewText": "Knapp 10 Euro bezahlt man f\u00fcr diese Aufbewahrungsdose f\u00fcr alte Rasierklingen. Es passen eine gro\u00dfe Menge Klingen rein und es dauert lange bis die Dose voll ist. Das Besondere ist dabei, dass man diese Dose nicht \u00f6ffnet und die Klingen umf\u00fcllt und entsorgt sondern diese Dose mit den Klingen entsorgt. Zwei Gedanken sind nun entscheidend. Zum Einen verhindert man Verletzungen beim Umf\u00fcllen der gebrauchten Klingen zum Anderen sch\u00fctzt man den Entsorger der mit der Dose in Ber\u00fchrung kommt. Da Dose und Klingen zusammen recycelt werden ist es auch nicht notwendig die Dose und die Klingen zu trennen. Diese Dose funktioniert somit im Recycling Prozess wie ein M\u00fclleimer den man mitsamt dem M\u00fcll recycelt. Ich finde diese Methode sicher und nachhaltig da man nur einen M\u00fcllk\u00f6rper produziert und nicht viele einzelne Klingen im M\u00fcll rumfliegen hat oder diese in ein Glasgef\u00e4\u00df f\u00fcllt, welches man dann beim Recycling von den Klingen trennen muss.Die Dose ist klein und passt auf jeden Badezimmertisch. Die Bilder zeigen den Gr\u00f6\u00dfenvergleich mit einer Deo-Dose.Ich kann diese Klingenaufbewahrungsdose absolut empfehlen und werde sie auch wieder kaufen.",
