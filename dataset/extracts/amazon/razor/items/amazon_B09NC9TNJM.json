I was forced to seek another type of razor because the refills for Harry's was just getting too expensive!!! Decided to try these and I will definitely buy them again and again. A very close shave and gentle on the skin. So far, no razor burn on pits or legs. Love them and recommend this razor to everyone! A very good shave, nice lightweight handle and the price fits my budget nicely.",
