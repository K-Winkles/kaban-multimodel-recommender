Didn't mind if it took multiple passes, even, so long as it eventually worked.What I've learned after using 10 of the 12 razors that came in this pack...they are Absolutely Useless for anyone with hair thicker than the finest spiderweb. (And even then you'll need five passes to get the hair shaved.) I threw away the last two because they were just that useless it wasn't worth the effort.As an example, attempts to shave my armpits resulted in still having 1/4cm hairs after over a dozen passes. Never did it shave anywhere near 'smooth'.They also left small cuts on my skin's curvier areas. How it did that without shaving the hair properly, I don't know. But I had unshaved hair and tiny cuts and that is Unacceptable.Save your money and buy a different brand of disposable razor. I bought a pack of cheaper ones marketed for men that do a massively better job. Which is just sad.",
