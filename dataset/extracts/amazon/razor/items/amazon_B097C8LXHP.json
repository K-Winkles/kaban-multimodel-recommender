                "reviewText": "There are a *lot* of reviews triggered by a Gillette commercial on here. Thin skin, indeed! lolI bought this stubble eraser type thing not having any idea if it would work or if it was a gimmick, but to my surprise, it works pretty well!I shave my head 2-3 times per week and probably due to my odd head shape, the 5 razor blades are just too many blades for curved areas. I think having three blades allows for better maneuverability. The stubble guides appear to do *something*? I dunno. I don't think it's straightening out the stubble as claimed but they seem to help with irritation. Shaving my head gets as close of a shave as any other disposable I've tried.I do keep a light beard but I prefer to shave my neck. It works just fine for this area and I don't have any complaints about nicks or anything.I wish the anti-irritation pools of goo would last longer, and maybe the blades as well, but this is a pretty common complaint. I do like this system, even if I don't completely understand why it works. I wonder if a regular three blade system would work just as well? Anyway, I'll keep using this product.",
