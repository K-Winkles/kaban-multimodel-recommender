        "description": "Get a closer, long-lasting shave with the Gillette Fusion5 men's razor. Gillette's Fusion5 razors are designed to provide the comfort of five blades, and the precision of one. Featuring a revamped razor handle to give you control, five sharp anti-friction blades for a shave you can barely feel, and a precision trimmer that makes shaving hard-to-reach areas such as under the nose and the sideburns easy. Equipped with soft microfins that gently stretch and smooth your skin to prepare the hairs for a close shave. The simple yet effective blade stabilization maintains optimal blade spacing for comfort while allowing the blades to adjust to the contours of your face. The larger* lubrication strip provides lubrication after the blades and gives a smooth glide while you shave. Concerned your Gillette handle won't fit? All Fusion5 blades fit all Gillette 5-blade razor handles. Engineered for durability, each refill lasts up to 18 shaves, giving you the ability to customize your shave and get the most out of every blade. Pairs perfectly with Gillette\u2019s PRO Shaving Gel for added protection from shaving irritation (Vs Mach3)",
