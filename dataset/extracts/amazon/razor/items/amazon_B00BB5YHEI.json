                "reviewText": "This is the second time I've ordered this exact model. Remington apparently knows they have an excellent product in this lower priced shaver market. The battery lasts for weeks at first and so continues to work well for years, even as the time between charges slowly decreases. I get a great shave when the parts are new and it cleans well under water or with a provided brush.I knocked off a star, though, as the trimmer stopped working in less than two weeks. This is exactly what happened the first time I bought the same model several years ago. I use a separete haircut/trimmer device which makes that less important but it would be much better if there was a reliable trimmer for sideburns and basic beard or mustache trimming.Pros--Excellent shaver with tough beard--Long lasting battery--Long lasting shaverCons--Trimmer breaks in first week or two and seems to be a product flaw as it happened year ago as well",

                "reviewText": "BEST SHAVER EVER!!!!To any reading this I am an African-American male getting ready to depart for basic training on Jan 13th (todays date of this review is Oct 12th) I have always had problems with the usage of regular razors and getting razor bumps. However, being clean shaven is part of the requirements and with the pay and duty requirements for regular enlisted I knew I wouldnt be able to go to the barber every other day to stay smooth.I searched literally for a week before deciding on which particular shaver to buy. I looked at the top expensive models from Braun and Panasonic but couldnt quite bite the bullet cuz of the price tag. After I figured out that I wouldn't spend more than 100 bucks I started looking at features of each specific razor. Keep reading:The thing that caught my eye about this is the Interceptor Shaving Technology. Basically it has a built in trimmer in between the two foils that will cut hair longer than stubble to stubble length. Every other foil shaver and even rotary shaver I looked at did not have this feature. And even my barber told me that with electric shavers you really have to not let the hair get longer than stubble or else they wont work. This appealed to me as more of a preventative and unique measure but still very beneficialI originally received this razor on Sept 24th and I have been using it for about 2 and a half weeks and have been using it without fail ever since. In my case a couple weeks before I received it I stopped shaving because I had to let my face heal from trying to use a regular razor so I had about a solid 1/16th inch of hair covering my face. I unboxed it, read the instructions, and it took about 8-10 mins but the result was like I had shaven with a razor. I had no whiskers or stray hairs anywhere and my skin felt baby smooth and not irritated!I have been using it ever since without fail and still NO RAZOR BUMPS only baby smooth skin!!It's cordless so all you have to do is make sure it's charged before you use it. Some tips:1)Don't use alot of pressure when shaving.2)DO NOT go in circles or fast. Use deliberate kind of slow straight back-forth up/down side to side motions. This thing has a pivot head that adjusts to the contours of your jawline and neck. After using for a little bit you will notice a sound difference when it is actually cutting vs going over smooth hair free skin3)Make sure your skin is clean and completely dry and not oily4)Make sure you clean after every use. This helps to keep the razors under the foil able to cut like a regular razor5)For supreme results use day and night. I personally, use it at night only but my friend who I recommended this to has facial hair that grows extremely fast so he has to use it more but is still baby smooth and bump free like meI have recommended this to ALL of my friends and think I will purchase another one just in case it ever breaks or whatever. It is that good. LOVE IT!!!!!!",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Worst Shaver I Have Ever Owned. I Feared That It Would Get Me Fired, So I Discontinued Using It.",
                "reviewText": "Let me first say that I have always liked Remington Shavers, I've previously owned four or five, and have been using them for over 25 years. I even purchased a very expensive Braun once, but eventually went back to buy a twenty-something-dollar Remington because it seemed to me to work just as well.No so anymore.Out of the box, this Remington F5-5800 worked \"okay\". That's right, just okay. It performed more poorly than other razors I have used, but it was acceptable to me; and because it was new and I obtained it for a good price, I initially turned a blind eye to its shortcomings.Fairly soon, however, I noticed that despite the graduated power charge lights on the front, it really only performed best when at maximum charge. So even if all five lights - or four out of five are green, the head is not gyrating as quickly, and your stubble will not be cut as fast or as well.After about 3-4 months, I realized that even fully charged, I was getting a poor shave. I was spending longer and longer shaving - like mowing the lawn with a dull blade, you keep going over the same areas again and again.After the fifth month or so, the few minutes I had always spent shaving had turned in to many more than that, and the result I was getting was poor at best: Lots of orphaned stubble, and dry, damaged facial skin from the constant \"rubbing\" with the shaver.It was around this time - prior to the sixth month mark - that I fully awoke from my somnambulance and denial: While shaving before work, it was taking me what seemed like forever to shave. I brought out the Mach 3 manual safety razor to do some dry blade \"finish\" work after using the Remington, but even it could not clear the \"mess\" Remy left behind. I spent much longer shaving than ever, and got a poorer result than ever.Well, I couldn't spend much longer solving this facial hair problem that morning - it was getting late and I had to get to work. I had spent twice the time I should have on my whiskers and I looked unshaven - or maybe worse - like I had been shaving while drunk. Add to that that I was now going to be arriving late to work as a result of spending an inordinate amount of time shaving - or trying to.As luck would have it, my supervisor came to talk with me that morning face to face - just 15 inches from my \"dirty\" face. He didn't say anything, but he could have. And arriving to work that way again - poorly groomed - could have led to an issue, or a poor performance review.So that was the last straw - I decided I would never use that cruddy Remington F5-5800 Foil Shaver again. Instead, I went back to using my OLD Remingtons: A (originally inexpensive) Titanium MS 280 that is 5 or more years old, and a much cheaper one from probably 15 years ago (it has F3790 on the back).My point is, that both these shavers - with screens and blades older than one year, and much older than my five month new F5-5800 - performed extraordinarily better. The difference was remarkable to me. So much so that I will try to find replacement parts for these, and not even bother trying to get a new razor. (The reason I justified getting the F5-5800 was because these other two razors needed - or so I thought - new screens and blades).So I guess the main problem with the Remington F5-5800 Foil Shaver is - outside of charging issues - a poorly made screen and blade. And a blade and screen system that deteriorates and/or dulls MUCH quicker than I've ever experienced - like after 4 or 5 months (and remember, I have been using Remington electric shavers for 25 years).I'll add just a bit more information too - my facial hair is not extremely coarse and I do not have a high concentration of follicles on my face. I am fair skinned with dishwater blond hair and northern European features. If I go without shaving for a couple days, I do not get a nice, even facial shadow like maybe an Italian guy might.If you have dark hair, coarse facial follicles, and get a \"nice\" (think Miami Vice) five o'clock shadow, then this shaver might go dull on you within a month. If it does, be sure to return it - I think you only have 30 days to do so. Or better yet, don't buy it at all - its a real dog (I love dogs; no offense to dogs ;)I can't return mine - so the only consolation I have with my loss is to try and warn others. Buy it if you must, but make sure you set an alert before the time is up for you to return it.",

I found that changing the angle of the shaver stopped that feeling of hairs being pulled/yanked out. The two different cutter head styles makes for a faster saving experience.Only drawback is if you a have a bit of beard growth you will have to frequently empty the shaver of cut facial hairs or they start to fall from the shaver onto the floor, vanity or into the sink.",

It's also very easy to cleanNow for the bad. The replaceable guard is very fragile and broke within the first week, it's not the biggest issue however as the guard and blades have to be replaced every 6 months anyways so I'm not docking too many points. Another not real issue but one for me is that the machine isn't water proof so it can't be used in the shower or with wet skin, dry skin for best results. The trimmer is basically useless so don't bother with it. It takes 12 hours to charge completely which is a feature that most companies use on their products to extend the batteries life span, still annoying though.In all, it's a good razor, and the issues I have with it are minor at best, 4 stars.",
