                "reviewText": "This was the 1st razor I bought to try the switch to single edge blades after 25+ years of shaving with the big brand multi-bladed razors. After a week or two of getting used to it, I'd grown to really love this shave that this razor produces.I happily used this razor for 9 months, and then the threaded part of the handle stripped. I was kind of ticked off that something I spent $50 died after 9 months, but KEEP READING!Convinced that the switch to single edge was indeed where I wanted to stay, I bought a cheap $18 single edge razor handle. And THAT is when I really learned that this handle has something special about it. The cheaper razor handle just wasn't as smooth or comfortable as this Bevel brand had been. Had I purchased the cheap one outright, I probably would have switched back to multi razors. Fortunately, the handle of the cheap one fit the head of this Bevel model, and I really appreciated that this handle is something special!It's unfortunate that it stripped, BUT, I'm happily shaving with my centaur version of this razor. I guess I'd recommend it, but be careful not to overtighten it! It really produces a superior shave. Happy Shaving!",

                "reviewText": "So far, this is the best safety razor I've tried. The first thing I noticed was that it's a lot heavier than other razors. I thought this might throw me off when trying to use it, but that didn't turn out to be the case. Over several weeks of use, I've had no issues. The shave is more aggressive with less irritation and risk of cuts and nicks than other brands. Of course, I'm careful with the angle and the pressure.Sometimes, it feels like it's just gliding along my face doing nothing, but then when I feel where I just shaved, there's no hair. I've never had issues with razor bumps, but my skin is fairly sensitive, so I'm glad I opted for a Bevel this time.",

                "reviewText": "Shaves worse than disposable razors. Design makes no sense with it needing to be opened where the blade is as opposed to other razors that have the release by the handle. The handle being smooth metal with no grip is also a poor design choice since it will be prone to slipping while shaving. Highly recommend another brand like Weishi which is cheaper, better quality, and designed better. This was a huge waste of money.",
