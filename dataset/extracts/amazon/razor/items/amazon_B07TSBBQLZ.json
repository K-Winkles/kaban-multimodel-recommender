I use these mainly like a razor on my face, not just for eyebrows, as the name of this product implies.The blade of this product is not good as Tinkles. The reviews that show poor quality for these are spot on. That said, as you can see from the pictures, the product has its merits (obviously not a professional photographer here!). The cost of these products shown in the picture goes up from left (the current product review) to the most expensive of the three (Japonesque) - based on what I paid for them. If you are a first timer for derma planing - maybe try a high quality product first before going cheap? - that is my opinion.Reviews really help me decide on products and that is why I am taking time to write this review: to possibly help others who may be on the fence about these cheap razors.My opinion is Japonesque is the best quality and they can be purchased on Amazon. I find Tinkles, also on Amazon at fair prices, to be of good enough quality, lower price, and, like Japonesque, they can be used a few times. This is a once a week hygiene practice for me so it is really worth it to go with higher quality. That said, I provide some potential pros for these cheap razors below.The pictures show the used products of all 3, new product packaging for Tinkles, and the \"bulk cheaper razors\" . The cheapest one could not be used more than once as the blade deflected after one use - this is not visible in the photo. It caused scratches on my face. As the product description on Amazon states clearly - do not press hard on your face! However, I need to press just hard enough to exfoliate and trim \"peach fuzz\" on my face.Some reviews complain these cheap razors arrived with finger prints on them, and I did not find that to be the case - just cheaper plastic scratches from the razors scraping against each other - likely because they come in bulk packaging. IMHO these cheap blades could be used for crafting projects - especially since they have that protective cover - How can the company make a profit selling these at 17cents per blade?! It really is inexpensive, if you can use them.Another plug for the cheapest razors: If you believe the dermabrasion caused by these blades might stimulate collagen (versus scarring) and do not mind the nicks that come from the poor blade quality, then these blades might be a deal for you.I am on the fence about returning them, based on price alone - otherwise, for dermaplaning, I will go back to using Tinkle based on the quality/price ratio and \"splurge\" on Japonesque when there is a sale (they feel great in my hand and are just the right weight and size). Both products really work well for me - what can I say? - I am a bargain hunter at heart.Hope this was helpful:).",
