This one is PERFECT for mustache, goatees, and simply edge trimming. Also, comes with extra blades! Be sure to rinse after every use, dry it (I use one of those compressed air cans to ensure it is completely dry). I then dampen the blade a bit with Johnson's baby oil - this will keep your blade sharp and will last you a lot longer!",

The size is perfect to work around my microbladed eyebrows and tidy up any strays. The razor is sharp but comfortable on my skin. I also use it on my upper lip and chin.Highly recommended! Also love the metal handle and option for replacement blades!",

I\u2019d end up covered in bleeding nicks then days of tiny scabs (one of which has actually left a scar), or it wouldn\u2019t shave \u2018cleanly\u2019, leaving little random stubbles that the razor just refused to shift, or it would go blunt within seconds of use.This razor? It\u2019s like a dream. I haven\u2019t once nicked the skin, it shaves cleanly and even removes pesky stubble when tidying the brows up, it stays sharp, has a \u2018luxury\u2019 brand feel to it with high quality materials, and it\u2019s lightweight, fitting nicely in my makeup bag.My only regret is that I didn\u2019t discover it sooner.",
