                "reviewText": "These are definitely the REAL deal and I know this for certain because I accidentally bought the wrong ones once -and they were absolutely horrible, AND very cheaply made! The real ones have a serrated blade, and the fake ones do not have the serrated blade, but instead just a plain blade with remnants of glue on it. The real ones say Tinkle on the handle, the fake ones do not. The real ones have a clear plastic cap that goes over the blade and slightly locks in place, the fake ones have a slightly foggy looking plastic cap (I mean not perfectly see through) with no groove or anything to lock the cap into place. The real Tinkle blade 3 packs also have a serrated line punched along the cardboard back, so you can open the packaging easier, the fake ones do not.The real Tinkle blades are the blades that I use to help groom and shape my husband's sideburns and beard/goatee, and the REAL Tinkle razors work perfectly for this job, and I wouldn't (and won't) use any other!!! I HIGHLY recommend the REAL Tinkle blades and that is EXACTLY what these are!!!! I have included some pictures with this review of both the REAL and the fake Tinkle blades to help prevent others from accidentally making the same mistake that I once did, which was ordering the fake ones by accident. Now what I do to prevent that from ever happening again in the future is to just go to my Amazon account and look under my orders, find my Tinkle blades and simply reorder, so that I know that I will always be getting the REAL deal!!! Hope this helps others out there!!! P.S. The picture of the Tinkle pack that I am holding up in one picture are the real ones, but I just wanted people to be able to see the back clearly.",

The only complaint I have is that there is a little inconsistency in how sharp each batch is. I ran into a pack that seemed duller than another packs (thus the 4 star rating instead of 5). Overall though, I would recommend.",
