However, when environment concerns came into play, I wanted to try another razor.When I saw the good reviews, good price and BAMBOO handle, I decided to give the BullDog brand razor a try.

                "reviewText": "I tried this one to replace an old plastic-handle big-name-brand razor. I've been using the Bulldog about 5 months. The problem with that one and this new Bulldog one, is the razor head will pop off while I'm shaving. Maybe it's my technique or something. I'm not pressing very hard, probably as much or less than you'd use to press the buttons on a microwave oven. The issue might be that the mechanism and the blade frame are both plastic and I'm guessing the plastic is twisting/bending just enough to unhitch the blade, a poor design or materials. Now this doesn't happen every shave, not yet anyways, but I will probably not buy this one again since I've not had it long.",
