Unfortunately, I also noticed it was very difficult to clean after use. The top compartment only opens slightly, so hair would clog it up. Within 10-12 months I started noticing rust and it eventually died (after several new battery attempts). I'm currently looking to replace it but don't plan to buy this one again.",

If you have those stubborn hairs that you just missed with a razor. You can take the comb off and cut those stubborn weeds down. No one will ever know. It works great for that. If you like everything clean and smooth. This will not do it on its own, sorry it takes a little more effort. It will leave very short stubble. It's a trimmers doing what it is designed to do. Why do some people want to blame the trimmer? It's not the trimmers fault. You still need a razor. Sorry folks. That's life. I hope you enjoyed reading this. On a serious note. I do highly recommend this, as an inexpensive way to clean up or to get it done quick and easy.",

                "reviewText": "Okay, so, this is a great tool to have in your hair-maintenance arsenal. The trimmer is terrific. Works well, and no pinches or painful grabs. HOWEVER, who the \ud83e\udd2c decided to create a waterproof device that can be kept in a damp location, like the shower, and yet designed an on/off mechanism that is completely smooth--no grips, ridges, silicone? It's nearly impossible to turn on/off in the shower without grabbing a towel and drying the device AND hands. What the .... !?!? Come on, people, step it up with the design sitch. Meanwhile, IF you do buy it (and you should, nonetheless, because it does what is is supposed to do), grab a rubber band or two, maybe a hair tie, and wrap them tightly around the base for a handhold. Voila! Problem semi-solved.",

                "reviewText": "I like how small this thing is. I doubted it when I opened the package, but while trying to shave one's bush down under, it is comforting and convenient to not be handling a bulky device.The added clip is great for cutting to a common length for folks who still want to see/feel some hair--but be patient, as I found this required a few passes. Removing the clip and shaving down to skin was faster, I did not feel any tugging or nicks, and it was very easy and intuitive. I haven't tried this in the shower yet, but it is advertised as being made for that--I recommend that path instead of making a mess everywhere like a barber shop floor.Read the instructions for how to clean the shaver head, that is the only part not intuitive. Also, the instructions seem to indicate you need to oil the blade after washing, but there's no oil included in my box, so... contemplate where to get some.",
