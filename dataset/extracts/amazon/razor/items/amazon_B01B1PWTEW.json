It's so convenient to have the foaming soap bar attached to the razor to provide a smooth, close shave with every stroke against the skin. I love that there are scented refills for those like me who like to be invigorated by the scents. This tropical citrus blend is awesome; the perfect pick-me-up during a morning shower and shave session.",

We've actually used these razors for several years and we wouldn't use another.These refills are wonderful. They are moisturizing and lathering eliminating the need for soap or shaving cream. That's perfect for my teen (and for me too). There is 4 blades so you can count on a great shave and it seems to hug your body with no nicks.These refills are super and I do love the razors they are made for.",

I hopped back in the shower and was really surprised by the pleasant scent. It just smelled like nice fresh soap! I've been using Intuition razors for 15 years now I'd say (so that's all the review you need for the razor ;). After I got out of the shower I was surprised that these are \"tropical\" scented as they are not overly scented or \"fake citrus\" smelling. I could smell the citrus after I read it on the box but I still stand by these having such a fresh pleasant floral soap scent. I love them!If you found this review helpful in making a decision regarding purchasing this item, please let me know below :)",

They lather so well and NEVER leave your leg dry while shaving AS LONG AS YOU KEEP YOUR RAZOR AND LEG WET ...but they only last about 4shaves each razor before all the soap or whatevr it is that makes it glide smoothly is gone and you have to change heads. The razor seems to still have lots of shaves left in it, but the soap is gone so you have to put a new one on to get that lather again. Its pretty costly but I love them and how quick ot makes my shower but just can't really afford thrm at this rate.....sadface",

I used mens razor for years because they were simple, precise, and gave me a clean close shave. Then one day I notice I was getting terrible ingrown hairs and my skin was so itchy the day after shaving. Thats when I decided to switch back to women's razor. There is seriously no other razor better than this one for sensitive skin. I no longer have ingrown hairs and my skin isn't itchy anymore . I love the butter bar that surrounds the blade (originally thinking I would hate it) and it last quite a while too. I can easily get 4-5 shaves out one blade before having to replace it. I also love the fact that I don't have to use shaving cream. Again, these are so great for people who have sensitive skin!!",

The part with the cream can move (in and out) a little so as time goes by and the outside cream stays at the same level as the razor so you always have protection. You should really use it in the shower to be able to use it for longer. If you are in a rush you can use it outside the shower, but make sure you have water close by to wet it and a wet cloth to rinse the part you are shaving otherwise you will have a layer of dry cream all over. I don't find this one to have any particular smell. It doesn't come with the stick so make sure you already have one of those. The all have their own little plastic case so they don't dry out before you use them.",
