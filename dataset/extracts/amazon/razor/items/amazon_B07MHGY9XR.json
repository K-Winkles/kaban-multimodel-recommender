                "reviewText": "This is a good razor for those who find it hard to NOT cut yourself whilst shaving.I will say, this is not a body hair shaver, your best bet for body hair is cutting it (when it's long) with the trimming blade. Don't go too wild, it's just that: trimming.Now, as for how it shaves, it is actually fairly decent.Glide: As far as how it glides across the shaving area, it depends on a couple of things. How much shaving cream is there on the area? When did you last shave? Which areas is it in, any problematic areas for you to shave? I find it hard to wet shave a lot of my face without some discomfort, but in areas where it's not as problematic, it glides fairly well.Shave Closeness: Since it has two blades, it, of course, is not as deep as 5, 4, or even 3-blade razors. That being said, I would say it is a decently deep shave if you go over the same area a few times. Just take a couple fingers and run them across areas you've gone over to check, against the grain, if the hair is still there. After one day(at least for my hair growth), you get the hint of scratchiness, and I usually like to shave with it every other day.Discomfort: I would say the discomfort of shaving with this is just shaving. I've been using electrics for 90% of shaves after puberty, so I am fairly inexperienced. Thusly, this is the perfect razor for me. I had always thought that normal \"\"\"safety\"\"\" razors would actually be a good razor if it was like a Norelco, which has it's blades behind about 0.5 mm steel with slits for the hairs. This is the best I've seen for something like that in safety razors. The discomfort I have is at its height when I haven't shaved a couple days.Anything else I missed is probably in the other reviews. You CAN cut yourself with this razor, but it reduces the chance of it.",
