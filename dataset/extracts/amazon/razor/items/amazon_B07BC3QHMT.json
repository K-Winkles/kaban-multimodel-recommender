My old razor worked fine, just everyone in the house uses the same brand and steals my blades. Thought I would try this Bic. (I actually thought I ordered Gillette- I screwed up)The handle is comfortable, but the cartridge eject button is right in the middle so you will accidentally hit it all the time. That isn\u2019t my complaint. The blades are junk. They lose their sharpness after 2 shaves, from then on it feels like you are scraping knives across your face. It feels worse than a dry shave. I shave in the shower, the blade clogs with hair and is impossible to clear, even with the massage head, if you tap the head on the shower wall, the blade pops off and is impossible to put back on, soooo you slide out another new blade and get 10 more strokes and feel like it\u2019s dragging broken glass across your face again. I rinse between every other stroke, waste of time. I haven\u2019t had shaver burn in decades, but I\u2019ve had it so bad with these blades I wasn\u2019t able to shave for several days after each try. I tried shaving at the sink ( American Crew moisturizing shave cream) and still my face feels like fire afterward. The trim edge \u201cdoesn\u2019t \u201c, it is sharp and cuts hair but not wear you think it is going to cut. Trimming around your nose will make you bleed. And don\u2019t make the mistake of rinse razor and lying flat on the counter- the strips on the razor face will stick to the counter. I threw away the last two blades- I surrender, in a quest for something better. I think I will read comments before buying the next one. If I could give it a minus grade- I would, and I rarely bitch about products. The handle is comfortable, that is the only saving grace- EXCEPT it is too wide to hang in the shaver hanger on the shower mirror- I forgot about that, I had to buy a special shower rack just for that razor \ud83d\ude21",

                "reviewText": "I've been happy with Gillette for decades, shaving every day, but it seems that their prices, like so many items these days, are darn expensive. On the surface, this Bic seemed just about the same and what could go wrong with TITANTIUM blades. On the 3rd shave I noticed a less than smooth shave. On the 4th shave I got nicked twice - and that never happens with a Gillette. The Bic blades - at least for me - less only 3 days as oppose to almost a month with the Gillette Fusion 5. Twice the cost but 8-9 times the use - seems like simple math to me. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. It's about time I learn, but I've been taken plenty :( Bob",

I figured no biggie and didn\u2019t really think about it. Then the next blade was very discomforting as well.In my opinion the blades are dull , I don\u2019t know how or why , but they are not working as I anticipated. Never had this problem when I purchased them in a store.I suspect moisture somehow got to them and they are very disappointing.Not sure who or what is the blame, but I certainly will only purchase them in a store from now on.",

If you do, the razor cartridge will pop off the handle. EVERY TIME. And you will be left to fish for it in the bottom of the shower. 3) The release button for the razor cartridge is HUGE and easy to accidentally touch while using the razor to shave. This causes, you guessed it, the razor to detach from the handle with the slightest touch.Do yourself a favor and just buy a different razor. Your future self will thank you.",
