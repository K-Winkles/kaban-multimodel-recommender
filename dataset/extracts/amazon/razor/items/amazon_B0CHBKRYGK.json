                "reviewText": "I have used double edged razors for over a decade now, and have used everything from Feather DEs at 10 times the price of this to even cheaper razors, and all across the range. Generally, they fall into 3 camps: [1] cheap introductory ones in the sub 25 buck range, [2] decent work horses that range from 25 to 75 (think Merkur, and the like), and [3] the premium brands like Feather and Rockwell at 75 and up. It's unfair for me to stack this razor up against a Rockwell because it's not. And it's not at that price point either.On first impression, the razor makes noise when you jiggle it, it lacks any heft, and the coating on it feels artificial. The house brand blades are unmarked and I threw them away immediately because I wanted to test the razor itself, and wanted to give it good Japanese made blades to give it a fighting chance.Despite the initial jiggle, the blade did screw on tight (I had to force it down) and it did work. The blade is aggressive (meaning a large gap around the blade), but most DE razors in the introductory price point are. As such, it's not as forgiving as other razors.All in all, it's a decent razor for the price point. If you are currently shelling out tons per blade refill, and would like to dip your toe into the world of Double Edge shaving, there are worse razors. This isn't your forever razor, bit it is a perfectly adequate tester to see if this style of shaving is for you.",

                "reviewText": "I typically have always shaved with an electric razor. The only manual razor I have used, if my memory serves me correctly, it a Gillette Mach 5.My first impression when I unboxed this razor was that the blades seemed very thin/flimsy. I guess I just expected them to be thicker. However, the razor did its job effectively despite my initial concerns. This is definitely a very cost-effective way to shave. The razor is well-balanced and feels good in my hand. It was easy to get the hang of using it.",

                "reviewText": "This safety razor brings back memories from my childhood watching my dad shave. I think he actually taught me how to shave using a safety razor, but I haven\u2019t used one in decades. I was excited to give this a try, as I have absolutely no luck with electric shavers. I\u2019ve used lots of different bladed systems, but I\u2019m always on the lookout for something better. One thing I really like about this razor is the nicely textured grip handle. It makes it so easy to hold and control, and believe me, I want to make sure I\u2019m in control when I use a double edged safety razor! Another feature of this razor that is just fantastic is the butterfly opening that makes inserting the blade so easy.As far as performance goes, I think it did a nice job giving me a pretty close shave. I usually use a warm wash cloth and put it on my face to loosen up my skin. Then, I apply some shaving cream that I like, and finally start in with the actual shaving. For my first time using this it went pretty smoothly, but I think I need to get it in my head that this isn\u2019t quite like shaving with traditional disposable blade systems. I think it\u2019s just going to take some time to get into a different habit when using this. Also, I'm not sure the actual blades are the greatest quality. Overall, though, it did a decent job, and it is kind of fun to use.",

                "reviewText": "This double edged safety razer is well balanced and built -- love the slick black, but mine came with some rust inside the opening, so questionable as to how well it will hold up over time.Butterfly opening is easy to twist open and close to lock the blade in place -- allows for easy blade changeout and cleaning. Included blades aren't the best, but the handle works great and is easy to hold and maneuver.Love the travel case that came with this with enough space to hold extra blades and a small mirror.",
