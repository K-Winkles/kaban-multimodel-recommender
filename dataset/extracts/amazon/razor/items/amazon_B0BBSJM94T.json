                "reviewText": "I realize it is strange for a husband to review his wife's razor.My wife exclusively uses the Venus Extra Smooth Blade Cartridges and is amazed how smoothly they shave her legs. My wife prefers using the standard all plastic Venus razor with these cartridges because she likes the plastic razor's significantly lighter weight which makes it easier to control and results in less likelihood of razor nicks.When I lost my Mach3 razor while on vacation, I discovered my wife's Venus razor also fits the men's Mach3 cartridges! The splendid ergonomic shape of the Venus razor fits a hand better than ANY custom Mach3 razor I have ever used (e.g. Solid Chrome Metal Men's Razor for Gillette Mach3 Cartridge ) ! The only deficiency in using the standard women's plastic Venus razor as a man's Mach3 razor is that it is extremely light weight (similar to a plastic disposable razor) and a heavier weight razor is better at shaving a man's thick beard. When my wife saw this $8 deal on the heavier all metal Venus Platinum razor, she immediately ordered it because I get to keep the solid metal Venus Platinum as a Mach3 razor for myself and my wife gets to keep the two Venus Extra Smooth cartridges as refills for her standard plastic Venus razor.The Venus Platinum razor is made of a satin finished solid metal handle that has a 54g weight, the minimum weight needed for use as a man's Mach3 razor. Most custom men's razors are at least 10% heavier (closer to 60g) but in this case its slightly lighter weight is OK when matched with its ergonomic features. The ergonomic details of the handle's curved shape and flattened pommel are perfect for a palm's grip and provides finger rests for precise control of the razor while shaving a beard both DOWN and UP. The textured rubber component surfaces on the metal handle provide excellently placed finger grips for use with wet hands. The razor's head holds the Mach3 cartridge securely attached and the offset head angles the cartridge very well to avoid nicks while shaving. The razor's excess head-width is a superficial cosmetic glitch and is the only clue the Venus Platinum razor was not intended for use as a Mach3 cartridge razor (see photos).The Venus Platinum razor is the VERY BEST ERGONOMIC MEN'S MACH3 CARTRIDGE RAZOR available at any price! (Luckily my wife doesn't like the razor's significant additional weight or else I wouldn't get to keep it for myself!) And the Venus Extra Smooth Cartridges are the best available for shaving legs.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the Gillette Venus Platinum Extra Smooth Metal Handle Razor with 2 Refills for $10.97 ($12.97 minus the $2.00 coupon offered on Amazon). As my daughter and I often mix up our supplies, I was motivated to find a Venus razor with an appearance distinctively different from the regular blue one. Also, this one just looked super cool. Totally my style. Finally, a razor blade that doesn't look like a favor handed out at a Pink Sweet 16 Party.Once it arrived, I was happy to see that it has a solid metal appearance. It's not hallow plastic wrapped in a cheap silver foil. It actually seems like stainless steel and has some weight to it. After a month of regular use, the razor has maintained its original appearance.The Extra Smooth is now my #1 favorite blade type. It gives a super close shave. I have to use high quality razors and maintain aseptic technique (Eg: Change blades frequently, use different blades for body versus bikini region) as my skin is prone to ingrown hairs and razor burn. This blade works soooo well on my super sensitive skin! Much more so than the Venus \"Sensitive\" Blades. Even when I'm \"speed shaving\" in the early morning, I rarely slice my skin up with this blade. It also seems to dry well in between uses.As with all other Venus blades, I haven't been successful in getting the enclosed suction cup holder to work. It always falls down, regardless of the material I place it on. Instead, I place it vertically in my shower organizer caddy in order to allow it to fully dry in between uses.",

                "reviewText": "I love everything about this razor. First and foremost, I was thrilled to find a Venus line razor with a metal handle. Despite the unnecessary amount of plastic packaging it comes in, the metal handle has weight to it and is wonderfully sturdy and of great quality; it really feels like it will last a lifetime and as such, I did not feel guilty buying it despite its more expensive price tag compared to the plastic Venus handles.As for the slipping that so many people have mentioned before me, I have not once had this issue. This handle actually sits in the hand very comfortably no matter what angle I hold it at, and overall I find it easier to grip than the plastic ones, thanks to the rubber pieces being placed in just the right areas.As for the blades themselves, to put it bluntly: I have never had a closer shave in my life. I only need to go over an area once and then I am on to the next. They leave my legs feeling beautifully soft and well moisturized; I have not had to apply lotion after shaving with the blades that this handle comes with. With that being said, I like that the attachment on the handle is compatible across the various Venus brand variety of blades. Although I can't imagine myself straying from the ones that came in this package, it is nice to know that I would not need to buy an entire new set - I can pick whatever blades I choose. But that goes for any Venus handle you purchase.",

The materials is environmentally friendly (even though the packaging isn't) and it should last for decades!My only complain is that it's heavier than the plastic one, but I think that's expected!",
