                "reviewText": "These were ok, but were not as good of quality as I had hoped. I bought these for my Venus Razor. They were a little cheaper than the name brand refills so I thought, why not! They do fit the Venus wands. However, they dull so fast! I don't know if they are just cheaper or not as sharp, but they do not work as well as the actual Venus razors. I'm using these up for my winter razors and will definitely be going back to the name brand after this. Oh well, worth a shot!",
