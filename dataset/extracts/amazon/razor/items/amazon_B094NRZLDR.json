                "reviewText": "I only gave one star because it's required. I bought a six pack of the blades to go with the DSC handle that I love. When the blades arrived, I found out that they have discontinued the handle and replaced it with a new style. So then I buy the new handle. My first impression before even shaving was how brittle,thin and crappy the quality of the blades were. I attached it to my handle a start shaving... not only is the blade piece so brittle that you feel like you can't add pressure without it breaking off but I had to shave over each section three times and my legs weren't even that hairy. Even after 3 rounds, I can still feel stubble.I have used Dollar shave club for years and I used to love their quality and sharp, impressive shavers, but now I'm disgusted with the down turn. What a huge waste of money for razors that I could barely shave my under arms with more or less my legs.",
