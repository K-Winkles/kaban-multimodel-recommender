                "reviewText": "I've been spending approximately $100 every 6-8 weeks having professional dermaplanning performed at a salon. I'm actively trying to reduce the amount of money I spend at the salon, so I researched at-home devices and settled on this one. I am astonished at how easy (and safe) this tool is to use. I applied a shave oil to clean skin before using this. It exfoliated my skin beautifully and removed all the vellus hair (\"peach fuzz.\") I used a magnifying mirror to make sure I got all the tiny hairs around my eye brows and hair line. My skin felt amazing the next day, possibly because with the exfoliation, all my skin care products really absorbed. My make up went on so seamlessly. I honestly do not see a difference between this and the professional care. I hope this lasts as long as the salon treatments--I'll update my review after 6 weeks.",

So excited to have found them on Amazon!These are super sharp, but it's easy to use without cutting yourself.I use them on my face and arms and they work well for both. As long as you have moisturizer (lotion, oil, etc) on the skin before you shave, you'll have a smooth shave.There are so sharp they're usually good for 2 uses on the face and 3 or 4 uses if you want to just them on a less delicate part of your skin, like your arms.It's very precise, so I pin up any stray hairs I don't want to get in the way when shaving my face.",
