                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Dorco is the BEST QUALITY with 75% Lower Prices & FREE 2-Day Shipping! I'm Addicted for YEARS now!",
                "reviewText": "Let me make it clear that I DO order my Dorco razor products directly from Dorco, but I have attached a photo showing my last order (a few days ago) that included 3 full units, several refills, and even a special razor pack for my son and everything in the attached photo cost me LESS THAN $45.00. It's amazing. I typically order once per year (in bulk) and spend hundreds less than buying similar/less advanced razors in-store for triple or even quadruple the cost. These razors (Dorco) are who supplies the Dollar Shave Club. Except that you spend an average of at least 60% less than the Shave Club for the SAME razors. Oh....and did I mention that their \"free shipping\" option whether for one razor or a bulk supply STILL ships FREE and arrives in less than 2 days?? That's not a bonus or based on spending a certain amount, either. The latest deal direct from Dorco was \"$20 off of any $50 purchase\" and trust me....if you are spending $50 there....you are funding you, your mate, and any kids for at least 6 months to a year easily. And with the discounts...you're spending about $30 per 6 months with FREE 2 day shipping (but I swear it arrived less than 2 days direct from Dorco). They are AMAZING. Which is why I'm writing the review here instead of on their site.The razor pictured is what I use for specific lady-parts, but I ordered the complete Pace 7 set, This set, a 3 pack of the 6-blade razors with shaving cream built into the base (for my young son who is growing a kinda-mustache) plus refills for my Pace 6, my boyfriend's Pace 6 PLUS trimmer, AND refills for the razor pictured as well as extras for my Pace 7 that is their most expensive product (sans the \"power\" version of the Pace 7 which I find unnecessary). These guys are AMAZING!!!!I have been buying in small bulk (ie: family size) from them for 2 years and I can't believe how much money I've saved. Go get one high end Venus or Gillette in a store and then spend $14.00 on a 3 pack of refills? No. I get 7 Blade Razors, 6 Blade Razors with trimmers, a \"Lady\" 6 Blade, a \"Lady Pace 6\", plus THIS Pace 6 which is slightly different from the other plus several packs of refills for under $50 and it arrives for FREE in less than 2 days. They are ALWAYS running promos and deals that are incredible. This one was $20 off of $50. They also had a $10 off of $30 (still free 2 day shipping).These razors are SO much better than the Venus, the Gillette, or any other expensive razor you've purchased in store and likely paid $20 for a refill pack of 4 blades. Not here! The photo I'm attaching shows exactly what I got for less than $50 with free 2 day shipping that spans the 2 guys in my house as well as my lady blades and the \"men's blades\" that I use. It's SO cheap and the blades are all so much better than what you get from stores and clubs. Dorco supplies ALL of the blades to the Dollar Shave Club except rebranded and hiked up about 50% to 70% through the subscription. Please keep in mind that when you order directly from Dorco, there is NO minimum and you don't have to buy in bulk to get the 2-day Free Shipping. I ordered a bunch of razors and blades this past time and then forgot my son's \"new\" facial hair growth and ordered $10 in razors for him separately that are 6 blade razors with shaving cream built right into the base for easy use (3 of them that are disposable) and even that small order was still free 2 day shipping. They arrived at once in less than 2 days and on top of that....they included a FREE tube of shaving cream that retails for over $7.99 on their site for free as a gift.This website and all of their razors are amazing! It's saved me actual HUNDREDS of dollars since I've used them and they are better quality than what you buy in stores or from shave clubs. I have 4 separate razors that I use for different body parts and STILL save money. My son now has 3 razors with 6 blades and built in cream for his new mustache. These make me laugh at the fact that I used to pay $14.99 for 3 refill blades on a Venus or Schick or Hydro when I can now spend $50 or less on more than one year's worth of separate razors AND refills AND high quality creams and don't even have to worry or think about it because I know they'll have deals.The razor in the photo is just one of the three I use. I use the men's Pace 7 on my legs and delicate areas, the Lady Pace 6 for all other areas, and this Pace 6 (green) for in between areas. Did I mention that you can interchange the heads on any of these razors if you happen to have the refills and the base and/or the base and the refills? They're fabulous enough that I HAD to post on Amazon because whether you're ordering them from Dorco.com directly (which I recommend for the always-ongoing promos) or whether you order them on Amazon....you will save about 75% per year even if you only use the best of the best.They are the best razors out there. And since I didn't purchase them here, my photo shows that I DO purchase them regularly for several years now and also shows what an \"under $50 with free 2 day shipping\" order looks like from them, regardless of what style/blade/men/women (etc) you choose from. These have saved our faces, legs, and other regions from the costly price of high quality razors and refills at outrageous prices in stores. My personal favorite for *women* is the *men's* Pace 7. It smooths all curves and lasts and lasts. My boyfriend prefers the Pace 6 PLUS that has 6 blades plus a trimmer on the back. For full body shaving *as a lady* I prefer THIS Pace 6 or the regular Pink Pace 6 for full leg, body, face, and delicate shaving. And these aren't cheap plastic. This razor as well as the Pace 6 PLUS, Pace 7, and Pace 6 Lady are all metal and solid without the cheap plastic feeling.If you've been buying from clubs or buying in-store and groaning at the prices....this will delight you beyond belief. Try all of them. Get a \"try it pack\" (which they have tons of) and you'll still save money. Dorco is freaking amazing and here's our 6 month purchase for 3 people in one household (1 woman and 2 men) for less than $50 total in the photo. Buy it! Omg....I can't recommend enough!",

None of us have ever had razor burn or shaving cuts from this razor. I would rate it very high on your shaving list. They always deliver quickly and the moisturizing strip stays through many shaves.

I am a woman who shaves her legs and forearms daily, and a single blade will last me well over a month, usually closer to 6 weeks. I\u2019ve gotten several friends and my boyfriend on the bandwagon.

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars DORCO PACE 6 PLUS RAZOR SYSTEM",
                "reviewText": "My background, I have been shaving for 50 years, wow, I'm an old dude. I have used Schick, Gillette & other razor brands, very recently including Personna & DorcoUS brands as well as many different types of razors: 1) double blade safety razors. While in the Army, one time I even shaved without the safety handle which I strongly do not recommend. Also while in the Army I was forced to \"dry\" shave, once again I also strongly do not recommend, as lots of nicks & irritated skin, but this was way better than just the hand held razor blade. Overall I don't reccomend the Army period. People you don't know, try to kill you; 2) I then tried electric shavers, one a triple headed \"Norelco\" also a \"Remington\" electric with a \"micro shield\" & both resulted in skin rash; 3) I used many brands of double edged saftey razors, including, Gillette \"Trac II & Sensor 2 blade & they seemed a big improvement; 4) I used Gillette Trac 3 & Trac 3 Turbo for decades, but recently Costco introduced a Gillette Trac 3 \"Signature\" razor instead of Turbo Trac 3sthat I think is a reduction in quality, lessened quantities & an increase in price. This was the reason I decided to check other razor systems; 5) before this, I had tried two brands of double blade cartridges, then after this a friend told me of Dorco Pace 2 & I also saw Personna 2 bladed razors advertised, so I tried them as Gillete 2 bladed razors were too hard to find & too expensive; 6) after this attempted rip off by Costco, I also tried Dorco Pace 3; 7) next I tried Dorco Pace 4; 8) then I tried Schick Hydro with 5 blades. I did not try Gillette Fusion, 5 blade as they seem too expensive, also I did not try Harry's 5 blade as I felt finding a razor shouldn't be such a hassle; 9) FINALLY I did, however, try these Dorco Pace 6 Plus with a trimming blade & the size of the razor cartridge is humongous which can make it difficult if you shave your upper lip which is not an issue for me, since I sport a moustache. As for how many shaves per cartridge, they seem to last a couple of weeks, for me; 10) I also tried Dorco Pace 7, wow, seven blades! & the only Dorco razor I had yet to try. I was concerned with clogged blades & over priced gimmicks, thus I'd never tried a manual shaver that needs a battery & this was also the reason I kept using the Trac 3s. If you're still reading, you realize my evaluation could have been be skipped over until I typed \"finally\" in upper case. I wet shave as instructions suggest & as I usually do, except for the Army punishment ordeal & whenI used electric razors. After these too numerous razor trials, I think these Dorco Pace 6 Plus razors give the best results for the cost. These 6 blade Dorco also have a trimming blade on the opposite side. These Dorco Pace 6 Plus are the best shaving system I've used regardless of cost. I do a wet shave prep as I haven't had to play Army for 45 years, so no dry shaving in the field & don't think I'll ever be drafted again. I & Dorco advise to not use too much shaving cream or gel after prepping. I also rinse often while shaving. I even clean my razors with a \"Water Pic\" after use before returning them to their holders. I'm attentive while shaving & go with & then against the 'grain'. I then rinse the area shaved with cool water & lastly apply a soothing cream. I use 1% hydrocortisone & I never get nicks or irritated skin. My shaves are close enough that there's no insultation against cold until stubble returns, so consider yourself warned if you need to expose yourself to cold weather. Disclaimer, I received nothing for this review except discovering a very good razor system that is very good for satisfying, economical shaves. I hope this helps you decide what razor system works best for you & you don't have to spend the time or money that I did to gain this info. Cheers",
