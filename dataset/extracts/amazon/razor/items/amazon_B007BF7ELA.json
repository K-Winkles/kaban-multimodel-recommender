                "reviewText": "I've been on the hunt for a razor that doesn't irritate my skin but still gives me a close shave, and the BIC Flex 4 Refillable Razors hit nearly every mark. The four blades are superb, gliding over contours without tugging, cutting close enough to make my morning routine a breeze. Sensitive skin? No problem. These razors have been kind to mine, with fewer nicks and bumps than I'm used to.The handle is ergonomic, making it easy to keep a firm grip even in the wet conditions of the shower. The blades last longer than expected, too, which is a wallet-friendly bonus.Now, for the minor concern: while the blades themselves are stellar, the mechanism to attach them to the handle feels a bit flimsy. I'm always extra careful when changing blades, as it seems like it could break with too much pressure.All in all, for those looking to marry quality with cost-effectiveness, the BIC Flex 4 Razors are a solid choice. Just handle with care when it's time for a new blade!",
