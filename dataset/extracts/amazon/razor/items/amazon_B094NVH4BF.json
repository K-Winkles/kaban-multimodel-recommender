                "reviewText": "I purchased this product 18 months ago. I had no complaints until about 3 months ago, when cartridges started to pop off the handle at the slightest touch, when using the edge trimmer blade. The cartridge clip (circled in red in my picture) seems to become less effective over time. I am not sure why. I was able to fix the problem temporarily by bending the clip in the direction of the cartridge attachment point with a pair of needle-nose pliers. Unfortunately, the problem has returned.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this to replace my Gillette Mach 3 for which the refills had gotten pretty expensive. The razors are great and cost about 1/2 or less than the Gillette refills I wasn't sure about the shave cream as I generally use Pacific Shaving Company Natural Shaving Cream. While Pacific is still better, the Dollar Shave Club shave cream is decent. I like the menthol. Overall I'm pleased and will switch for razor refills for sure.",
