                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A must for those who shave their heads",
                "reviewText": "Got one for my father (soon 87) who sometimes has a mild tremor in his hands (not Parkinson, fortunately) after hearing the reviews and online noise, and knowing that, unlike me, he never could get into DE razors - and even with all of his conditions, it has been great for him: good shaves, no nicks, cuts or irritation whatsoever. He seems to be happy with it and spends less time shaving his face.So that alone speaks of itself and I thought it would be great for me too. I lost half of my hair at 21 and have been shaving my head ever since with cheap or no name DE razors or a \"safety\" shavette. I just got it and tried it shaving head+beard, and here are my first impressions:First things first, its build and engineering qualities are just outstanding. That alone makes it deserve five stars.I felt it weird at first because this is the first time I used a \"multi-razor cartridge\"-type razor after 8 years of using DE razors or a shavette. The area that goes in contact with your skin is considerably big so it's difficult to tell where are the razors exactly cutting, but that is expected in this type of razors.Unlike DE razors, I really appreciate that its handle is not cilyndrical or some symmetric orthogon that makes it difficult to tell where the blade side is when you're shaving the back of your head - so only it will be difficult for it to rotate when you're holding in your hands but you are able to reposition it without looking. At least in this mate version the grip is great and doesn't slip.The multiple blades make it for an perfect* shave, and it indeed reduces the shaving time compared to DE razors - no need to do multiple passes to get a clean shave on a certain area. Also it reduces irritation greatly - I also had no cuts, nicks nor irritation - as my father, I don't even use shaving specific shampoos, oils or whatever.I had \"long\" hair (say, 5 mm) when shaving - and surprisingly hair didn't get clogged as much as I imagined - though as you can suppose my hair has never been thick, so I can't tell how it would be for people with thick beard.Now, it wasn't a 100% perfect shave, but it was very close. Not much because of the peculiarities of the razor but more because my skull has some bumps and irregularities at the back side, so it's almost impossible for any razor to do a perfect shave back there.Still, at one moment at the crown area the upper part of the head (the area that covers the upper blade) slipped over the skin and I almost got a cut, something that has happened to me with any razor - the blade accidentally slips horizontally and cuts you. Fortunately it didn't happened this time - maybe a bad technique from my part but still I feel like that area can be somewhat too slippy.Naturally it's not the ideal solution when shaving over tight areas (around your ears, your upper lip) when you need to tell where the blade is cutting. Still I got the closest and nicest shave for the upper lip I've ever had.Its other \"caveat\" for me, just to be nitpicky, is that as the contact area is so big (and its head pivots by itself) it's difficult to \"sense\" how to apply somewhat pressure to the blades against the skin when shaving. I get this can be just an \"only me\" thing whereas it can be a great feature for other people who prefer to rely on the razor itself to do its job - and indeed it does a great job.",

                "reviewText": "Ever since I came of age to shave, I used cartridge razors such as Gilette Mach 3, Fusion, Shick Quattro, and Harry's. For the last eight years, I've been shaving my head and a few months ago grew my beard out for the first time. I let it grow at the sideburns and jaw, with my mustache connecting to my beard.Last year, I got the opportunity to review The Twig, another razor by Leaf. It was a gamechanger: I could shave my entire face and head and never experience razor performance degradation from clogs! Thus began a journey to try other razors that weren't cartridge type. It took time; The Twig and the other razors I tried don't have pivoting heads like cartridge razors do, so I had to practice getting good blade angle alignment.As I tried different butterfly razors, I got one that had an aggressive blade. I was again mind boggled that the aggressive razor let me get that smooth shave so much faster and easier! I tried The Twig one day and appreciated it's weight balance over the butterfly razors, but it took more effort to get a close shave.So, I looked up Leaf's shavers and discovered this razor, as well as The Thorn. Prime Day came around last month, and The Thorn was on sale! I put it in my cart immediately, and saw this was on sale. I thought \"Eh, why the heck not.\" and bought it as well.To end my story here and summarize my use of razors now, The Thorn is everything I like about The Twig, and I thought I'd use this Leaf razor once or twice then just use The Thorn. Not the case! The Thorn is used on my face and throat, with this Leaf being used on my neck and head.This Leaf has the best of both worlds for head shaving! Since it holds three individual blades, I can't clog it at all. AND, it has a pivoting head! That is such a convenient boon for head shaving, one that I didn't realize I missed so much! I can shave against the grain on my head once with this razor, and only need to touch up one or two areas at the base of my skull that are hard to get with any razor. But I don't need to make multiple passes or worry about this razor skimming over stubble instead of cutting it due to blade angle alignment.And again, it's such a relief to be able to shave a section of my scalp, then lightly rinse this razor under water and see all of the cut hair tumble right out! No more tapping cartridges on the sink or trying to pinch off the water flow from the faucet to get a forced stream of water to flush a cartridge out and making a mess! Since this razor's head is so broad, it's not as easy to cut yourself compared to a single bladed razor. Heck, I've yet to cut myself at all with this razor!So, you might be wondering why I bother using my Twig or Thorn at all, when this Leaf is working so well for me. This is why I mentioned my beard: Don't let this razor near longer hair, or it WILL grab onto it!I had a few shortened patches of hair on my beard from learning this the hard way! It wasn't a big deal, my beard (I normally keep it short) was getting a bit long, so I just trimmed it with my electric clippers. But if my beard was already to length.... I would've been annoyed.So, that's why I reserve this razor only for my head. It did do a fantastic job on my cheeks and throat, mind, but between this razor's head size and it's willingness to grab hair, I don't think it's worth trying to hedge my beard. So keep that in mind if you're considering this razor for facial use only and also grow a beard and/or don't shave your head and have sideburns that need to be hedged. Either have another smaller razor on hand or use an electric T blade clipper.But, I think this Leaf and The Thorn have ended my journey of different razors. It's so easy to get a close shave in a decent timeframe by shaving my face and throat with hedging my beard with The Thorn and shaving my scalp with this Leaf that I no longer have a desire to use anything else with regards to manual, bladed shaving.FInally, I've used Leaf's blades, some no-name brand blades, and blades from Derby in all of my Leaf brand razors, to include this one and have never had a fitment issue. Depending on how often you shave and how quickly your hair wears blades down, using a Leaf razor over cartridges could save you money! I know I spend a LOT less on shaving equipment now, having ditched my Harry's plan!",

                "reviewText": "How do I express my love for this shaver. Beautiful gold. Sleek design. And the shaving experience. out of this world. Granted, it certainly did not help that my previous razor was some ancient venus that I purchased back when I started getting leg hair and following the cultural norm, felt highly compelled to remove it. Not to mention that the last time I changed the head on said Venus was probably 2 years ago. I wish that was an exaggeration. Anyways I was nervous to use this thing of beauty due to dubious bloody results with my husbands regular safety razor. But I gave it the first swipe on the old hairy leg and thought- huh. That didn\u2019t seem to do anything. But lo and behold the hair was gone! It was simply such a smooth sharp shave I didn\u2019t feel a thing! Again, having a 2 year old razor head didn\u2019t help. Kind of like trying to cut a steak with a butter knife.My only complaint of this glorious item is the silicon sleeve to help with holding onto the soapy thing in the shower. It\u2019s a shame it hides the beauty of the razor. Surely they could have figured out some better grip design in the metal. And also the sleeve is THIRTEEN DOLLARS. Excuse me, I paid $123 for this razor, surely you could throw in a sleeve for free. I didn\u2019t design the razor poorly enough to need the sleeve , you did! That is my only complaint.The blades change easily. It seems very well made. It shaves like a dream. And it looks stunning- the most important part of a shaver. Ahem. No one else sees this shaver but me. And I can\u2019t get enough of it.",

                "reviewText": "Got this as a recommendation.So a lot of pros on this one:- uses any double or single edged razor blade, no locking in, very competitive prices for even high quality products, etc.- very easy to clean, this will still clog up like a cartridge razor, but because it can be easily opened up you can actually un-clog it without having to spend a lot of time.- swivel head makes it as easy to use as a cartridge razor, unlike other products that use de/se blades.- very easy to load new blades, between the strong magnets that will hold the blade in place and the 2 registration points that make it easy to make sure the blades are correctly aligned.- very solid construction and good feel in the hand, a bit tempted to get the silicon grips they make for this but then again not for a bit, I just spent 130 CAD on a razor :P, kinda wish it was included, or a stand for that matter, then again that might bump the price up even more.And a couple cons, which I kinda think are nit picks, and complaining about user error:- While I think it's difficult to get the blades misaligned, I did accidentally put a bend in a double edged blade when snapping it in half, which did end up messing up my face a bit. But in hind sight it is pretty easy to check for something like that. So It's not exactly idiot proof haha.- for face shaving the top bar of the razor's size makes it hard to get a good mustache shave, I already have a single bladed safety razor that does a good job of this, not really a problem on it's own but it does kinda mean that this >100$ razor doesn't entirely fill out what you need for a good face shave.- no soap bar (obviously), you are going to need to reapply soap or shaving cream as you shave, more often and more consistently than you would with disposable cartridge razors.",

It took a long time to test the razors available to get to this point, smooth and no nick shaving.Well the Leaf surpasses every expectation I have!! Right out of the box it was smooth and I didn't Knick myself even once. The closeness of the shave is better than my usual razor, baby but smooth. The manufacturing of the Leaf is like buying the Ferrari of razors. Will be recommending to all my shaving friends and posting on social media reviews shouting from the mountain tops!",
