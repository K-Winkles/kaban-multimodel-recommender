A little bulky for navigating knees and such. Not the absolute absolute smoothest shave, but definitely good enough. I'm glad they aren't subscription only anymore.",

I also would finish shaving for my husband to tell me a few hours later that my legs were looking hairy. Billie changed all of this. The shaving creams and razors are amazing! You get a sharp, smooth shave every time! My biggest issue with Billie was that sometimes it was hard to control the subscription and get razors when you needed them because the shipping felt slow. I love that they are on Amazon, so I can quickly order a second batch when needed!",

                "reviewText": "I've used Billie for years, and while it is not cheap, it is the only razor I've used that works for me. I'm VERY prone to razor rash and a host of other skin issues, but waxing at home is impractical, I can't afford laser hair removal or professional waxing, and.... well.... the Sicilian genes are strong, and I don't have the confidence to walk around looking like Sasquatch. \ud83e\udee3 With Billie razors, I rarely have issues, so I've been a loyal customer for a long time. I'm pleased that they're available on Amazon, so that I can get them quickly and as-needed!",
