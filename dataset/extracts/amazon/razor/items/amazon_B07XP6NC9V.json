It's a great shaver, with a nice weight to it, and all for a decent price that's less than $20. Can't complain at all, though the Edwin Jagger DE89 is only $25 or so and the fit and finish is definitely better on that. I can't say for sure where I fall on a star rating for this since to me, the extra few bucks is worth getting the better-made original that this bambaw razor was cloned from. Maybe you're different. Regardless it's great value for money so I can't fault it.",

I was just looking to get away from disposable razors due to cost and waste but I've been happy that these are a better shave too. It has been less irritating for my face as long as I stick to Bambaw blades. I tried some Dorco blades and that was awful (scratchy feeling and pulled on my hairs). I don't know if the blades or the safety razor were to blame. I'll just stick to Bambaw blades, they're a little more pricy but still overall cheaper than plastic disposables. I ordered the black razor but this isn't a true black. More of a dark gunmetal with a little brown in it too.",

                "reviewText": "Listen, safety razors ain\u2019t for everyone. It takes time to learn, takes skill to use, you\u2019re probably gonna cut yourself here and there, and you can\u2019t rush it. With that being said, once you get it down, it gives you a much higher quality shave than a disposable razor and with less irritation.This is an excellent razor for those wanting to see if using a safety razor is for them. It\u2019s not expensive, it\u2019s durable, and it looks great. I learned with this and it helped me out a lot when it came to skin irritation and calming down my rosacea.I highly recommend learning to shave with a safety razor through various YouTube videos. There are lots of very informative ones out there and I also recommend using a good shave soap or cream. You don\u2019t have to, but it\u2019ll make the experience more enjoyable (I use a brand called Southern Witchcrafts, they are soooo good).One extra thing I will say is this; there is no perfect razor. A safety razor will give you a less irritable and pleasant shave, but it takes time and skill. On days that I\u2019m in a hurry, I still use a disposable razor, but it\u2019s at the cost of skin irritation and are more expensive in the long run with the price of cartridge replacements. If you are thinking that a safety razor is gonna save time, it will not. Once you get good with them though, you\u2019ll be disappointed on days that you have to use a disposable razor.",

                "reviewText": "I switched to safety razors less than a year ago because the cost of cartridges is nuts and electric shavers just don't give me a close enough shave. I purchased a safety razor bundled set with a butterfly style razor and oils and creams and so on and it was fine but I had to shave at night because I was always left with red rashes that would take a few hours to clear up. One day I had seen an ad for the Henson shaver and the design concept made a lot of sense (in regards to eliminating the rash) but the price was a little steep. I looked through Amazon for a three piece shaver with a similar design and settled on the Bambaw. The build of the Bambaw is sturdy and it has a good weight. The blade that comes with the shaver is dull and after a few pointless strokes I swapped it out for an Astra. The shave was great. No nicks, no rash; just a smooth, clean and close shave. I can shave in the morning again. The stand is hefty and sleek and is just an extra 3 bucks. For the price, quality, and performance this safety razor is highly recommended.",

After the first shave I am already very impressed by both the shave, how easy it is to use and the affordability. Not only are the blades easy to swap and clean when compared to cartridges, they are incredibly cheap. You can get a box of a 100 for a just a few quid online and save yourself a lot of dosh.The Gillette and Wilkinson's cartridge brands are good, no doubt, but they are expensive and cannot be recycled and end up just filling up landfills. The blades I've used for this are both cheaper, easier to clean and give a clean cut that easily rivals your common razor brand. It is incredible. The weight of the razor is not too heavy, but the material used gives it a heftiness that makes it feel premium despite the affordable price point. It comes with 5 blades which should last you a while.It also may take a shave or two to adjust to the razor, especially how much pressure you need to exert to shave. I recommend a wet shave if you have coarse facial hair with a considerable dollop of shaving foam for the first go or so, primarily to get used to how much friction you need to apply to shave. I only nicked myself once on my first go, so if you're patient and consider yourself a decent shaver with a steady hand, you should be absolutely fine. While the blades aren't particularly sharp or painful to use, they can still give you a nasty cut if you're not careful.The blades are also easy to replace too, you just twist the head of the razor off and insert the blade, twist it back on and voila.I can't sing this products praise more. I regret not buying one years ago.",
