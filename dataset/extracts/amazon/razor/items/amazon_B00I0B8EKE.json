                "reviewText": "i have really sensitive skin and suffer from constant razor burn + ingrown hairs. but what bugs me the most about every razor i use is how easily they become clogged with hair, and how quickly i end up having to throw them away because of this. after years of searching i finally found this. it has a special design that leaves a very subtle gap between the blades, giving just enough room for any hair to slide through with ease. these razors will NEVER, EVER clog up!!! it's so easy to clean + maintain them. as long as you dry them off after shaving and don't let them rust, they will basically last forever.i still recommend discarding it once the blades start to become dull, but i have been in difficult situations where i could not afford to buy razors anymore and one big box of these would last me an entire year. now that's what i call a good value for the money!i personally think all other razors, including all other BIC razors, are terrible and i don't know why they stopped making them like this. i have yet to find a razor that i feel this comfortable with using. i am in the process of laser removal, but even afterwards i will still probably buy these just to have around in case!",
