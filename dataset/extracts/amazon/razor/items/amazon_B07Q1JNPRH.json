I bought my husband a box of these blades because I accidentally threw away the blades that came with his Hanson kit that I had bought him through Amazon that kit came with blades from India. He tried these Japanese blades and had to resort to buying Wilkinson blades of of all things. The Japanese blades were so incredibly well-made and sharp. He has a heavy hand when he shaves, because he\u2019s had poor blades over the years. He\u2019s learning curve with the Wilkinson is less painful, but not as close. he tells me that once he\u2019s got it down, he will switch back to the Japanese blades, knowing that he\u2019ll be more careful when he shaves with this Hanson butterfly razor. I don\u2019t dare use them on my legs. I\u2019m stuck with Harry\u2019s for now. Happy shaving women everywhere.",

I was mislead by the Japanese steel branding, thinking it wouldn\u2019t be made in China, but you get what you pay for. I don\u2019t have a thick beard or coarse hair, and these blades seemed to leave several cuts - abnormal for the short and simple shave I experience with other blades. Not my favorite, but I\u2019ll try them further and hope it improves.",
