                "reviewText": "My skin is very sensitive and I have lots of skin allergies like fragrance, Lysol, exfoliants, etc. I have tried just about every budget razor that you can find in the grocery store, at Target, or at CVS. Now, I just order these from Amazon, especially if I cannot find them right away in store.These are the only razors that NEVER leave me with bumps, irritation, rashes, or extreme dryness. There is absolutely nothing fancy about these razors in terms of the actual shave. It is a pretty standard close shave. However, the fact that my skin is free from imperfection afterward is something I can't put a price on. Excellent budget razor for sensitive skin!",
