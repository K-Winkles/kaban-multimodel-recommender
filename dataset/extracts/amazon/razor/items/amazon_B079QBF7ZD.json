I choose preserve in particular, because it's vegan and cruelty free. It does have a lubricating strip,but it doesn't last long. I get maybe 2 or 3 uses before the strip is dry. That doesn't bother me though as I prefer to use shaving cream and the blades themselves last long before they dull.",

                "reviewText": "All in all I am quite satisfied with this purchase. I saw quite a few reviews saying that the razor missed parts or skipped hairs. I'm not sure if that's true or not because while I did miss a few spots that had to be gone back over, they were the spots we ladies always miss shaving our legs - those awkward angles around the knees, near the ankle bone, etc. One thing to be noted is that I only got one use out of the moisturizer strip and then it was gone. That's the shortest life for a moisturizer strip any razor I've owned has had. That being said, it didn't inconvenience me too much because I generally use a shave oil anyway. It didn't give me any worse razor bumps than I already experience (KP sufferer here) and it felt sturdy when I was handling it. No nicks or cuts and no rust so far; I do follow the instructions and dry it lightly and store it outside of the shower to help prevent moisture from sitting on it. Overall, for an eco friendly razor at this price point I'd definitely recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "Many years ago I ordered a Preserve razor from Amazon. I was tired of buying disposable razors and tossing them in the trash once the blade dulled, and then repurchasing. I didn't like the impact this had on the environment. I have used my Preserve razor continuously since then, and have purchased these refill blades as needed (which isn't very often). I'm very happy with the quality and will continue to purchase.",
