                "reviewText": "A girlfriend of mine gave me one of these razors because I was complaining about some whiskers. I successfully used it for several months and it worked great. When replacing it, I grabbed a random brand at one of the stores we love to shop at that begins with a T and ends in an X. I figured since they all looked the same, they would all perform the same. Boy was I wrong. It left about a 16th of an inch of whisker and nicked my face constantly. When I would use it, it would sort of stutter along my skin. Very uncomfortable. Thankfully I remembered the brand that my girlfriend had given me. I ordered them again here. Work fabulous. Moves nice and smooth along my skin while cutting close and not a bit scary!",
