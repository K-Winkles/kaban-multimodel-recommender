It leaves a nasty film on my hand/fingers and is actually rubbing off in big \u201cchunks\u201d. It attracts every piece of hair that gets near it and sticks it into the glue-like sludge on the handle. So disgusting trying to finish your shower with this sticky slime on your fingers. It takes a bit more than just soap to get hands feeling clean again.",
