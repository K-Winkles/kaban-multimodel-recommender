                "reviewText": "These exceeded my expectations. I have used many types of razors over the years and the technology is getting better and better. I have been using the ones with the comfort glide on both sides to lessen ingrown hairs, red bumps, and cuts. So far, it has mostly worked. However, this was the first time using a pretty standard razor that none of that happened on the first try! The glide is smooth, got every hair, left nothing behind, no red bumps, no cuts (surprising!) and no goopy-ness after using (like the comfort strips often leave). These will work far better for travel because of that. But beyond that, the price point is better for 9 blades and a handle than what I have been paying for the \"fancier\" ones.The only thing that is weird is that image on the packaging shows the button on the front of the razor but it is in fact on the back. And the razor can be snapped in right side up and upside down, so that's a little odd. But because the shave was so good, I'll overlook these things.",

The spacing on the blades does make it easier to rinse hair out of it. The size of the blade head is decent for more intimate areas, though I do feel it still falls a little short if that's the area of focus for you. This would be a good set to travel with too as the replacement blades come with their own individual covers. I like these a good bit and will definitely consider getting them again, especially over the other no-name brands of disposable razors that are available in a similar price range.",

The main benefit is it being cleaned easily from rinsing. Looks like the blades being slightly further apart make it easier to rinse off rather than getting stuck in gaps like my other razors.It feels a bit cheaper than other (more expensive) razors, but gets the job done especially for the price.

                "reviewText": "These razors surpassed my expectations. The smooth glide eliminated red bumps and cuts on the first try, unlike previous razors. They're perfect for travel due to their effectiveness and affordability. The handle is secure, though the button's position and blade orientation are a bit confusing. Despite this, the razor's performance is outstanding. It provides a gentle, effective shave with easy cleaning. Lubricating strips are somewhat stiff, but the blades remain unclogged. The reusable handle reduces waste, making it a great value. Overall, a reliable choice for a smooth, hassle-free shave on various body parts. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "These work just like the other 4 blade razors I have tried in the past. The blades cut hair easily without cutting my skin, and it doesn't take a million passes to shave off the hair. It's gentle and effective. The handle is a good size, not too big or small and it's not flimsy feeling. The blade snap into the handle securely. I do wish it had the little button to eject the blade off of the handle, because trying to unsnap it is a little tricky. The cover slides easily back onto the blade while you are storing it so that you don't risk cutting yourself. The blades didn't get clogged with hair and soap and rinsed easily.",

You\u2019re not fighting to get those last little hairs off that are stuck in the blades.This did give a pretty good shave. I did use a nice shaving product while using this razor, but this razor definitely stands out on its own.Easy to put the refill on too!",

The only downside to this set is that the packaging can't be easily resealed/closed (if you need to store everything while traveling), but that's a minor nitpick.",
