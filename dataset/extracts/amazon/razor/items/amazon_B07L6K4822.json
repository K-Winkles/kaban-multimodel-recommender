They only have 2 blades and I found that I got cut a lot more than when I use a razor with 3 or more blades. The shave is good, sometimes you have to go over an area more than once. The razor is comfortable to hold and has a rubber grip on the top part of the handle. It also has a little button on the top to help you clean it which is handy. Overall if you want a cost effective razor and you do not have sensitive skin, this razor should be ok. If not, I would recommend a razor with more blades.",
