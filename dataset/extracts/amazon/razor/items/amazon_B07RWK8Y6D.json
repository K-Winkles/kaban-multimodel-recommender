                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying I've been a loyal user of Amazon razors for years, and they've been my go-to choice for a reason. The 5-blade razors, in particular, have been my holy grail, providing the smoothest, most comfortable shave I've ever experienced. Each replacement head lasts me well over a month, even with daily touch-ups and every other day shaving. I couldn't ask for more in terms of quality and longevity.A Slip in Attention:However, this time, I admit I didn't pay close attention while ordering, and I ended up with the 3-blade version instead of my beloved 5-blade razors. It was a classic case of my own oversight, and I'm kicking myself for not reading the listing more carefully. The 3-blade razors, while undoubtedly functional, just don't match the smoothness and precision I'm used to with the 5-blade razors.Personal Preference:I want to be clear; my slightly lower rating is purely due to my personal preference. The 3-blade razors are not bad by any means; they just don't align with my shaving habits and skin sensitivity as well as the 5-blade ones do. I find them a bit rougher on my skin, which is something I hadn't experienced with the 5-blade version.A Note to Fellow Shavers:So, here's a friendly reminder for fellow shavers: make sure to double-check the specifications and choose the razor that suits your preference best. Whether you're a fan of 3 blades or 5, Amazon razors are undeniably top-notch in terms of quality, sharpness, and durability. It's just a matter of what works best for your skin and shaving routine.Conclusion:In conclusion, Amazon razors are fantastic, and my experience with the 3-blade version hasn't changed that. While I might have a temporary mismatch in my shaving routine, I can confidently say that these razors, regardless of the blade count, are worth the investment. So, whether you're a meticulous reader like me or occasionally overlook details, rest assured that Amazon razors deliver quality, even if you accidentally end up with a version that doesn't align perfectly with your preferences. Here's to smooth shaving, no matter the blade count!",

They also last as long or longer than other razor companies. BUY BUY BUY",

The good news is we now have decent options when looking for cartridge razors. When I first saw these, I was skeptical, but because of the cost, I decided to try them out. I'm glad I did. They're not the best razor I've ever used but they've been doing a very nice job for me. And at about 1/2 the cost of some of the other brands I've used - that's good enough for me!",

I've tried most of the lower priced blades out there and found them disappointing. Poor quality, don't hold their sharpness beyond a a single shave, cheap feeling handle, etc. However, when i tried the Amazon Basic 3 blade I finally found what I was looking for! Well made, sharp blades, a price that hard to believe, and a good hefty feel to the handle. Plus the 3 blades suits me perfectly. The blades are long lasting and sharp. Simply these are best low cost blades I have tried....and believe me I've tries a lot of them! Try them and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "Back in the 90s I bought the Gilette Sensor, the first in an onslaught of ever-more-expensive and increasingly multi-bladed razors. It worked well enough, so I never jumped on the cash-vacuum bandwagon of Mach this or that next newest razor system. Between the Sensor and electric razors I\u2019ve been more or less good for about 30 years. Problems: electric never got as good a shave, and the sensor was always hard to rinse out during use\u2014blades too close to the edges or something. This new razor is a great improvement, as I\u2019m sure many of those higher priced would have been if I had tried them. It cuts close, stays sharp a long time and rinses out very easily compared to my old clogging Sensor. Plus it was way cheaper, especially the Prime day deal I got. I\u2019m pleased.",

                "reviewText": "I refuse to pay the Gillette prices, i've purchased every multi blade razor deal out there, Dollar Shave Club, Harry's, and the Amazon 5 blade razor. To be honest I find the Amazon 5 blade much better than everything and the price for 16 blades + a handle and 1 more blade at $20-$25 has been fair given it has been the best of all that I've tried. Last night I was shopping for refills and found that 12 packs of 3-blade cartridges were around $2 when purchased through Amazon Fresh, that was too good not try, I was hoping that they fit my 5-blade handle which they do. I shave every 2-3 days, have an average beard, and at $0.21 per blade I needed to try one out this morning. It's not quite as good as the 5 blades (I'd say 90%) however, its still great, lubrication is great, the blades were sharp and my face was smooth and nick-free. The only question is how many shaves I can get from a blade but today, I feel like I struck gold.",
