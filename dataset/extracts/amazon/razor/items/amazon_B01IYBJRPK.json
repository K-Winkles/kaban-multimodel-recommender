I didnt look at the amount before and was seaching my house looking for the missing box since it said comes with 4 boxes of 3, I was asking my husband when he opened it if he dropped a box. LolI love these razors and buy them often. Makes my skin soft afterwards. I have sensitive skin so I love these for that reason also!",
