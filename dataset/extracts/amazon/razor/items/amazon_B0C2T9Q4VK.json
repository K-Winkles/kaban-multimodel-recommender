I'd barely shave anything at all whenever I did a pass. On the day I was going to return it, I noticed the product picture looked a bit different than mine. Then it hit me: I had the bottom part screwed in upside down lmaoo. I paired it with some Astra blades and it works like a dream now. I don't think I'll have to buy more for a few years now.",

                "reviewText": "Prior to using a double edge safety razor to shave my face, I'd used the one designed to allow oneself to shave their back. I was able to use the back shaver as if it were a back scratcher, minus the scratches & cuts. This \"Double Edge Safety Razor\" not so much.Watched a few videos to see if a DESR was worth a try, and I got the feeling it was. Shaving the sides of my face and neck line was straight forward, kinda. Get the angle a little off and you'll feel the burn shortly afterwards. Where the DESR fails me is along my jaw line, chin and upper lip. If I shave these areas where I don't cut/razor burn myself, then the shave isn't smooth. Which translates into an uneven 5 O'clock shadow. All this being careful to not cut myself translates into double the amount of time it would take to shave my face with a disposable multi-blade razor. Ain't nobody got time for dat!At least I'm not out a great deal of money in trying this setup. Which oddly enough my reason for wanting it to work was to save money on blades. For those of you that are saying that I got what I paid for, I disagree. Build quality aside, reviews from the least expensive to the most expensive all contain new user experiences where the DESR had them bleeding. Even after multiple tries.This razor has a solid build quality, but as other reviewers have shown, it is susceptible to breaking if it falls from counter height, or higher. The included blade seemed to dull rather quickly within the 5 times I used it. I removed the blade after each use, cleaning it with alcohol and allowing it to air dry. Once again, a lot of extra time that isn't as necessary with a disposable multi-blade setup.I'll keep at it on the days that I'm not pressed for time to see if I can improve upon the shave quality in the more difficult areas, and maybe get to my goal of saving money on blades.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Matte Black Double Edge Safety Razor for Men, accompanied by 10 Platinum Coated Double Edge Safety Blades, with the expectation of a durable and reliable shaving experience. Unfortunately, my experience with this product has been nothing short of disappointing.Firstly, the matte black finish, which initially attracted me to the razor, turned out to be a major letdown. After just a few uses, the razor started showing signs of wear and chipping, making it look cheap and poorly constructed. The lack of durability in the finish is unacceptable, especially considering the premium appearance promised.Moreover, the functionality of the razor leaves much to be desired. The shaving process is far from smooth, with the blades causing discomfort and occasional nicks. I expected a superior performance from a product that claims to be a safety razor for men, but unfortunately, it falls short of even basic expectations.The 10 Platinum Coated Double Edge Safety Blades included in the package are equally disappointing. They dull much faster than anticipated, requiring frequent replacements. This not only diminishes the cost-effectiveness of the product but also adds to the inconvenience of having to switch blades so frequently.In summary, this purchase has been a regrettable one, and I feel compelled to express my dissatisfaction with the quality and performance of the Matte Black Double Edge Safety Razor. I would strongly advise against purchasing this product, as it does not deliver on its promises and fails to meet even the most basic standards for a shaving tool. Save your money and explore other options that provide better value for your investment.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using multi-blade razors for years. I decided to try this safety razor mostly due to blade cost.The first time I tried it on my legs i nicked myself in a dozen or so places before I called it quits.I tried again a week or so later, and paid more attention. The key is to use very light pressure and take it slowly. Although I still nicked myself a couple of times, I got a very smooth shave with a single pass. I suspect as I grow more accustomed to it the nicks will stop.Just remember -- the blade is *sharp*. That means it shaves almost effortlessly, but can easily cut you if you aren't careful. Take it easy and I think you'll be pleased.",

Then I went to simple BIC single blade disposables which worked fine.After some debate I decided to try this razor because it was cheap. It worked great. After a learning curve and a few cuts, I shave pretty fast. I like it most because where I used to have to shave everyday, I get such a close shave with this I only need to shave every other day.3 stars because it was hanging in my shower and randomly the part that screws into the head broke in half.Not sure why. Razor is sheep enough to buy it again, but if it breaks again I'm getting a different brand.",
