                "reviewText": "This thing gives me a good shave and I don't get a bunch of ingrown hairs or eviscerate my face when I use it. It's simple and comfortable enough to use that I shave a lot more than I used to.I have hand tremors. Anyone who also has to deal with them understands how much of a literal pain shaving can be. I gave up using razors because I was tired of slicing myself up. This allows me to get a nice close shave without a ton of cuts like I'd get with a traditional razor. You can still nick yourself if you hit a wrinkle or bump too aggressively but otherwise this is a no pain shaver. Unlike the old circle blade shavers I've tried this is quick and comfortable to use. I don't have to spend 20 minutes running it over the same spot 100 different ways hoping this time it'll get that one stray hair, most I've needed is a third pass on a really stubborn one. Again, I shave a lot more often than I used to now and even with my tremors it makes detailing much easier. I feel a lot better because I legitimately look better. It's especially great for around the ears if you cut your own hair. The guide comb is also really good and easy to use so far. My facial hair absolutely loves to get ingrown and make me look like I've got a ton of zits if shaved too close. This shaver trims just right to look good but not cause me to look like I've got a break out the next day. It's also really easy to clean thanks to it's water resistance.The downsides I've encountered that I'd attribute to the shaver itself is it doesn't seem to have the strongest grip on the head and there's often some redness where I've used it. The head has popped off on me a couple times but never while shaving and never in a way that actually broke either the head or handle. The redness isn't really bad in my case and is usually gone by the time I'm out of the shower but it is there. Would rather have a bit of redness than go back to any other shaver I've ever used.",

It doesn't cut exceptionally close so I follow it with my regular foil razor and get an awesome shave, as a trimmer I love it, you can't go wrong. I also have sensitive skin and have had no issues with it. My only criticism is the charger is a USB not a plug",

His skin is sensitive and the trimmer and shaver works well and leaves his skin very soft and smooth. He specifically requested this exact product again for a reason. It works well.",

I seem to prefer pulling it on the backside to going forward, especially on the sides. For the winter, I'm just doing my face, but in the summer will do the head with it too. Gets closer than the other shavers I have tried. Haven't used it wet yet. No need. Gets almost as good as a razor, and I'll probably just shave every other day. I'm retired, so I ain't got to be what people would call clean cut all the time, but if I did, a quick touch up every day would be just fine. I would say it actually works better than I had hoped for.",
