                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Warning! This newer model pulls hard on the skin!",
                "reviewText": "I, like others, only use this particular type of razor because it's the only one I've ever found that allowed me to shave the little hairs that grow close below my nose. These are really great for their precision, due to the small footprint of the shaving surface and the fact that the blades extend nearly all the way to the outer extremities of the shaving head. For this reason, I have used this razor for many years. They've always been very comfortable (as long as they were sharp), and they were INCREDIBLY SAFE. I rarely EVER got a nick, even if I shaved fast and without caring much about what I was doing. I even used them on the sides and back of my neck to clean up after and between haircuts and they never once cut that sensitive skin. Very safe.My last order was placed several years ago since I bought a bulk supply to last me a good long time. That purchase was the \"Slim Twin\" version that pre-dated this current model. I noted that there was great variability in the sharpness and longevity of the Slim Twin and, at times, tossed a razor in the trash soon after starting a new one due to dullness and uncomfortable \"pull\" while shaving. This has to be the fault of the razor because I shave in the shower and blast my face with very hot water for several minutes before I shave. For further verification, sharp razors are good from day one and stay sharp and comfortable for weeks and, on occasion, even months. Dull razors are often uncomfortable from day one and go downhill rapidly from there. The variance is in the individual razor, without any doubt. So, there's the bac kground.I got the new pack of this Schick Exacta2 Sensitive razor a few days ago and finally pitched the last of my old Slim Twin razors. That happened to be an especially good one that had lasted me several months (literally all Summer) and was somehow still going...never seemed to dull.The first razor I pulled out of the new pack was, quite literally, one of the dullest razors I've ever used. It pulls hard on my (not so heavy) beard and I am actually finding myself worrying about getting cut by this new one. What seems to have changed is the blade angle. The Exacta 2 feels like the blade angle has been increased in relation to the skin surface and is now more \"aggressive\" to the skin. Result? Rough cut, dull feel, heavy drag, and yes, increased skin irritation. Obviously, nothing good in that list.What to do? Well, I am quite familiar with the variability issue with these razors (described above) so I'll give them a chance to deliver up a sharp one with several more random draws from the bag. If they all turn up dull and uncomfortable, I'll have little choice but to -- very reluctantly -- look for a \"slim\" replacement brand if such a thing exists. I know a man can waste a lot of money chasing such things before a satisfactory alternative shows up and I don't relish having to do it. I just wish Schick would offer a REAL IMPROVEMENT when they replace an older product with a new one and, with my experience thus far, I can say this is a big step back. This is not a great razor.I hope I can offer an update to this review with better news and I will do that if sharper and more comfortable razors show up in my current supply. I will conclude this critical review by saying I am not presently confident that will be the case. As of now, I do not recommend this razor and will begin scouting a new brand or model that works. This one is, at best, 3 stars and, depending how it holds up, perhaps even 2. Wake up, Schick! If you sour us on your brand we may leave you and never come back.",
