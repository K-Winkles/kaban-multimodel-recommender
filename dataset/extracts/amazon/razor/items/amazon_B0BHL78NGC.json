                "media_text": "What are some myths about dermaplaning? \"Dermaplaning will make my facial hair grow back thicker or darker.\" FALSE: Although the myth has been around forever, the truth remains that your hair will grow and look the same after dermaplaning. Facial hair growth in women depends on androgen hormone levels, including testosterone and androstenedione. Dermaplaning can\u2019t change your hair growth, but it can seriously boost your skin\u2019s glow. \"Dermaplaning will irritate my skin.\" FALSE: Our routine leaves skin hydrated, smooth, and glowing. The dermaplaning blade features our patented Skin Defense Guard with a protective round tip that allows the at-home dermaplaning tool to get close to the skin with less risk of nicks or cuts. Some people believe you\u2019ll break out after dermaplaning, but this also just isn\u2019t true. It is, however, important to recognize that while dermaplaning is a great way to easily exfoliate skin, it isn\u2019t recommended for people with active acne or lesions. \"Dermaplaning is painful.\" FALSE: When done properly, dermaplaning has the similar sensation as shaving your legs or underarms. For a comfortable experience, it\u2019s important to find the best dermaplaning razor and be sure you\u2019re using a fresh, clean blade. Our razor blade with Skin Defense Guard has a protective guard around the blade and rounded protective tip for easy at-home use. Unlike most single-use razors, our dermaplaning razor features a premium, durable handle built to last, so you can simply change the blades with a click. The refillable blades may be used up to three times, for a smooth, comfortable experience. \"Dermaplaning can\u2019t be done at home.\" FALSE: Dermaplaning at home, with the right tool and routine, is an easy and effective way to achieve smooth, glowing skin. Thanks to our innovative, high-quality blade featuring a Skin Defense Guard and a rounded protective tip, Venus for Facial Hair & Skin Care respects your skin. The full DIY dermaplaning routine makes the at-home process affordable, and upkeep can be done as needed from the comfort of your own home. \"Dermaplaning on active acne can irritate the skin.\" TRUE: We do not recommend dermaplaning acne, or over an active pimple or lesion, as this can create a breakout or acne irritation.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve purchased many dermaplaning blades both on Amazon and elsewhere. Venus by Gillette is by far the best. The design (look at the top of the blade on this one and then look at the others) prevents cuts which I got with allllll the other cheapies. The Venus blades are sharp, so I\u2019m sure you could cut yourself if you weren\u2019t careful. You do need to use care when removing the cap, it\u2019s tight (as it should be). It\u2019s all well and good to get 24 pieces, but if none are very sharp, what\u2019s the point? This kit has one very well made, sturdy wand and 4 replacement heads. I expect it to last longer and work better than the cheap 12 or 24 piece cheapies. Also, the Schick three piece set was as dull as the cheapies, one arrived cracked though the delivery box was fine. This set works well on peach fuzz and exfoliation (go against the hair, not with it). You get what you pay for and I\u2019m glad I purchased this set.",
