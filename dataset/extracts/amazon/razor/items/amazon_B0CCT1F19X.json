                "reviewText": "I bought this for my elderly mom with dementia. She used to shave her facial hair with a disposable razor but no longer remembers to do it so I was looking for something I could use to do it for her that was a little safer for me to handle on her delicate skin. This little tool is perfect. It appears well built like it will last and only uses one battery which is surprisingly included at this price point. The feminine pink/grey color is attractive and it is just the right size to fit in my hand, not too big, not too small. It is quiet and simple to operate, easy to change battery, all pieces fit together snugly. The ring light helps me see light colored/gray hairs. Easy to clean/maintain, just twist off the top & blow or brush out hairs. I think there are replaceable heads that can be purchased for it though I have not looked into those yet. I have only had it a few days but we are very pleased with it so far. It appears to be made to last and with only a single battery vs the amount of power it uses, I would be very surprised if the battery life were short so I gave it the 5 stars on that. Shipping was fast, packaging was good, and price very reasonable - overall a good value that I would recommend to family/friends.",

It works quickly, gently and effectively to remove any facial hair I want to get rid of. I really like to remove the peach fuzz on my cheeks, and I have a slight mustache (it's pretty invisible, but I know it's there and it makes me self-conscious). For any of you that wonder, the peach fuzz, etc does NOT grow in any differently. Not thicker, not darker, just the same. My old model just kind of got weak gradually. I kept thinking I needed a new battery, but that didn't help. It lasted 2 or three years, and for the price I think that's fine. I anticipate this one to last at least as long. I really recommend this, I love it.",

The ring light is a slightly better than the light on my previous hair remover but neither light is very good and pretty much useless. I haven't used this product long enough to know the battery life. Over all I am happy with my purchase.",
