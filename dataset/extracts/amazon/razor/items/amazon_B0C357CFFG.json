The whole top of the razor is one piece, so nothing comes off until I need to change the cartridge. The blades are sharp for a close shave, but have a moisturized strip built around the blades, which protects from cutting while shaving. I don\u2019t know why I stopped using Venus razors, but won\u2019t use any other razor again! I highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I love the weight and shape of the body. The blades for these leave a lot to be desired. The large lubricating strips are gooey if they get too wet and if they are gone before the blade is dull then you are throwing it out anyway. Inside the strips are the plastic pieces that hold them on. Once they start poking thru, they will uncomfortably drag on your skin and even scrape. Not buying these blades again.",
