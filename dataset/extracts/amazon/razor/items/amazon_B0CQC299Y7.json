This is by far the best women's razor I have ever tried.I switched it back and forth with my mens razor while I was shaving my legs so I could compare them. The men's razor I use was only slightly better than the women's and I think it was due to it having 5 blades instead of 3.This razor was more comfortable to hold and more flexible around curves. It handled my ankles and knees far better than then the man's.I will probably end up keeping both on hand. The men's for the days I haven't shaved in weeks (winter month's) and the women's for when I keep up on shaving regularly.Another plus is the refill for this razor is a couple dollars cheaper than the men's.",
