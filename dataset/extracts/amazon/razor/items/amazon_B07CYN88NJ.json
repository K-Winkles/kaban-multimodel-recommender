Q: Is this razor suited for sensitive skin? A: Yes, the Solimo 5-blade razor has a lubricating strip with Vitamin E to help reduce irritation, has been dermatologically tested and is hypoallergenic. Q: How long does each razor head last? A: This is different for each person and depends on usage and hair type, but a good indication to change the blades is when shaving is not close or tugs on hairs.",

Being cheaper than the others and I've always used the Venus Razor. Well I'm here to let you know, do it. It's an actually really really good razor! Best part is that the blades and the moisture strip stay good for a good amount of time too! Then you get like 12 extra blades. I've had mine since the end of October and now it's just after Christmas. I have only been through about 3 blades since purchasing. The moisture strip does get a little gooey but it's worth it IMO. Can't beat the price now days with everything being so overpriced. Give it a try!Also , I personally haven't had any issues with irritation. My skin is somewhat sensitive but I've used it everywhere (yes down there) and not had any problems.",

                "reviewText": "I'd recommend this as a first razor for shaving your body! It's very safe compared to other razors. You'll still want lotion once you finish, but it's not super irritating.Personally, I'm going back to dollar shave club. It's not a close shave at all. I'm talking at least a 2 day difference between this and a more traditional razor. The hydrating strip only leaves gel behind after you shave, so I really don't understand the point of it. The gel does not act like a lotion.I've used a unisex razor for as long as I can remember, but I thought I'd try something girly after I ran out of blades. I never understood the benefit of a women's razor and I still don't. It just has more plastic and some gunk.Pro-tip: apply baby oil immediately after shaving while in the shower. It will help seal in hydration until you get out and use lotion.",

Since I bought a large pack with 16 cartridges, I offered my wife to try out the men's one after using this women's version and she preferred the men's one more, especially when she found out the men's ones were cheaper. Since we both switched to Solimo men's razors, I discovered that the exact same handles and cartridges are sold at FreshCo/Sobeys/Foodland under the store brand, and they're even cheaper than the Solimo cartridges, so we'll be buying from there in the future.",
