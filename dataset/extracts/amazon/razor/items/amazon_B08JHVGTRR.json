It is top notch! I dont know what more I could ask for something that does it all! I have even used it for those pesky face hairs and no cuts. It works great for the popular face shaving to remove fine hair we dont see so foundation is so much smoother. Still no cuts or problems there! The refills are the easiest I have used. I highly recommend this for all these reasons and more.",

                "reviewText": "okay seriously I was really skeptical that these would be different from the sensitive disposable ones that I use for legs and underarms, but they really are different. these seem to cause me to not have to shave my pubic area as often. they don't irritate and somehow honestly it feels more gentle than other razors. it is also able to get the closest shave ever. I have also not experienced any razor bumps or ingrown hairs although I am not normally very susceptible to them.anyway I'm just back to reorder again for the 3rd time. heck this might be the first and only thing I get on recurring order, that is how good they are. I do wish the refills also came with covers.I would suggest to only use this for your pubic area. I have no clue why people are using this for their legs and then complaining about it; it says on the package that it is for pubic hair. and instead of shave creams perhaps people should try a gentle non foaming face wash. I use Kate Somerville goat milk face cleanser and it is perfect as a shave cream down there.",

They last multiple uses as well (up to 10 uses). It has a very close cut which allows me to go longer better shaves. I also have never cut myself using this razor and I\u2019ve been using these razors for at least 2 years. If you have sensitive skin these are the razors for you.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to try these 'special' blades to see if they worked as advertised - reducing the irritation and bumps in the pubic area when shaving...they do, but not a complete reduction. Thing is, any time you have to make a pass more than once over the same area will result in irritation and the more passes the more irritated it gets. So, the key is to shave more frequently so fewer passes are needed!What aggravated me and reduced my review to just 3 stars was the fact that I had to buy a new handle just to use this pkg of blades. I first purchased blades only as I already had 2 'Venus Gillette' handles for razors and since they are named the same I expected the handles I had would fit. Of course they did not and although I was in a local store looking for the handle that would work, (the white one) I could not find one and ended up ordering it on Amazon too. I've added photos so you can see the difference between the handle heads and why these blades won't fit the other handles with the same name.I'm disgusted with Gillette for the waste of plastic and handles because they cannot be bothered to make handles with a consistent head!",

It has never been this bad until I used this product. It's great for underarms and everywhere else but ironically gives me painful in-growns for pubic hair ( I always keep clean razors and switch out the blades often). No razor bumps at least but I will have to keep looking for a better one for down there. The only downside I'd say is that it doesn't give the cleanest shave but is quite gentle. I will keep using this on legs, stomach and underarms as I continue laser hair removal.",
