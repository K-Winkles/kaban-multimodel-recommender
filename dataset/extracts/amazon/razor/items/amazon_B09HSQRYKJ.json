Seemed gimmicky at first, but I ordered them since it was a minimal investment to try.I've been using them for several months now and I'm really enjoying them, they feel great in the hand, nice and lightweight, and not slippery, which is important since I typically shave in the shower. Blades are excellent, close shave with no irritation, easy to switch out for a fresh blade.I am using them through subscribe and save; it's nice to be spending around $5 a month for my shaving needs, as one pack with three blades lasts me a month.Give them a try, five stars, highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I was worried it would be poorly made like a dry popsicle stick, but it\u2019s manages to be thin, light but actually smooth and sturdy!! :)I got a few more uses out of it than I would normally get from a disposable. razor. Very happy to go slightly more eco than the regular plastic ones. I have always been scared to use and change the eco reusable razors out there and I am so thankful there is an option for the rest of us who prefer the added safety of cartridges but want a slightly better option than full plastic razors! Willbe buying more in the future.",
