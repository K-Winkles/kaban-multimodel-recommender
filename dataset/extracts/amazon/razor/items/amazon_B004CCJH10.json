I go back and forth between those and men\u2019s razors, but I\u2019m always happy with my shave when I use these blades. The new handle on this one is EVERYTHING! No more bulk, easier to hold, easier to control.I\u2019m 41 now and my skin is way more sensitive than it was in my 20s. I have really coarse hair, too, which is why men\u2019s blades seem to work well for me. These leave my skin super soft and I NEVER get razor burn, scrapes, cuts, etc. Not even along my bikini line! And let\u2019s face it: I\u2019m lazy. 90% of the time I just shave wet or with soap, no shaving cream. This solves that and makes my lazy life easier!I highly recommend the new handle!!!",

                "reviewText": "Preface: Before we begin this review, what you need to know about me is that I\u2019m right hand dominant. Honestly, you probably could have figured that via the context clues, without me laying it out for you, but just in case, I\u2019m letting you know. I want you to get all you can from this review. Additionally, this review is aimed primarily at sensitive skinned shavers, but does not disclude non-sensitive skinned shavers. Or left-hand dominant shavers. This is an includive review. Ok? Ok. Lets do this.Did you know shaving doesnt have to be painful? Did you know it is possible to shave your legs without looking like you drop kicked a series of glass windows and tables? Did you know its possible to shave your legs, and not have them feel burny and itchy afterward, as if you are wearing pants made of hot fiberglass insulation? I didn\u2019t, but it\u2019s true!I tried everything: Venus (trash), Flamingo (garbage), dollar shave club (trash, but better trash, like trash from a wealthy neighborhood), nair (stinky, messy), an electric shaver (fun, but crap), the weird block thing with the special glass (dont even THINK about doing your knees). It all was flaming hot garbage.With other razors, I had to be so slow and gentle, like when you\u2019ve run out of good options in jenga, and you have to pull a block leaving the whole wobbly tower to balance on that one hero of a center block. And one wrong move could end in disaster. I felt like the dude in the movie who has to cut the right wire. Its exhausting! Even if you do everything \u201cright\u201d you could still end up with angry, bloody, bumpy skin. And I did! But that life is in the past for me now!With the Schick Intuition (the fork in an apple razor), I don\u2019t have Harvey Dent legs\u2026 you know what I do have? Nice Beluga Whale skin legs. Sleek, smooth, improved agility in water due to reduced drag forces. And I DONT have to be careful and concentrated when shaving anymore! I could shave my legs in the dark, drunk, with my left hand and not need a single bandaid! Just aerodynamic as heck with my smooth-a legs.So get the Schick intuition razor. Get the one with the sleek handle (because the chunky handle looks like a 2 hander), and enjoy your new beluga legs!*also, it feels appropriate to say: no one, including Schick, is paying me for this or giving me free stuff. And if they read this I doubt they would ever.",
