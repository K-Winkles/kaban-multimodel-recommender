There are Merkur razor blades made in the Czech Republic that come in small paper carton that are inferior to the German razor blades. German-made Merkur blades are available from razorbladesclub.com. Feather blades from Japan are very sharp but can be tough on your skin, and they are not as durable.

                "reviewText": "My original review is below, and as someone who reads and appreciates feedback, I needed to send in an updated review. I've totally changed my opinion of these blades, and think they are GREAT! I think the first blade I used must have been a bad one because since trying another blade, these have been my \"go to.\" These are sharp and I get a super close shave with these, but not too close. (Feathers are too close for me). These deserved another try in my shave routine and have now become part of the regular rotation.Original review below:My first shave with this razor, and it felt very harsh. I have sensitive skin and this left me feeling raw. I always give a blade multiple shaves to see if it gets better, but usually know on the first pass if I like it or not. I've tried a lot of razors and I think there are better values out there for the price. The blade is very sharp (IMO not as sharp as a feather, which is not my go to), but left my skin irritated. I haven't cut myself in a while, but had a couple of nicks with this blade. Not a very forgiving blade. I use a Gillette 1962 Slim adjustable. First shave was on a #4 setting and will try to dial it back and see if it gets better. Every DE shaver has an opinion on what works well for them. IMO it wasn't an aggressive shave, but was a harsh blade on my skin. Just two passes today, WTG and XTG...2 hours later and still feeling a burn.",
