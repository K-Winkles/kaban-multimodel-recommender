                "reviewText": "I've used so many razors throughout the years but I never realized many razors weren't cruelty free or eco friendly. Sooo I've tried 2 so far, & the first one I've used was Zomchi double edge razor that was rainbow & it cut the back of my leg so bad it left a scar. So when I went to search for others I did find 2 more & I've bought this one (Joy) which I'm over joyed lol Anyways it had more blades, with a lubrastrip to get avoid skin irritation etc I love the handle & everything about it. It reminds me of Venus razor. It's so neat it comes in different colours but I've got the pink one. So I guess next I'll get the teal one since I love that colour better. I try to use it as much as I can, & sometimes I get cut only if I have scratches from my cat or acne etc or If I'm using it too long which is normal. Another thing I love about it is that I can use it in the shower. Anyways I did come across another shaver which I would also love to try someday but since I've seen this one & all the great reviews I couldn't pass it up. I'm very happy with my purchase bc It's simply the best! I use it with Eos's shaving cream! :)",
