The size and shape of it are really comfortable in the hand and allow for easily maneuvering around in those hard to reach areas. I haven't had it run out of battery or even start to slow down during a full shaving session. The fact it charges with a USB-C cable instead of some proprietary plug is much appreciated and means I always have a back up from my other devices. i haven't traveled with it, but the locking feature is a good addition to keep from draining battery inside your bag. By far my favorite feature is just how smooth my skin is after shaving while never missing a spot with the built in light. The rotary shaver on the other end has been wonderful for close ups and leaves my skin without those painful red bumps I had come to dread. Overall, I would have no problem suggesting this to a friend or family member, and I'll definitely choose this brand again if I ever need a new one.",

                "reviewText": "The box it came in is super cute and sturdy. It came with a storage pouch which seems very durable. The manual was surprisingly well written and let me know about features I'd never have guessed the trimmer had just on visual examination, like the travel lock feature to keep it from accidentally being turned on. At first glance it didn't look like the head was adjustable, but on closer inspection you can see that the head slides on and you can use the grooves to set it to 3mm, 4.5mm, or 6mm length. I also wasn't expecting the stubble trimmer. My previous trimmer didn't have that and it's a very nice addition. I love that it's rechargeable. There's nothing worse than starting a trim and having the trimmer slow down and/or stop during the process because the batteries ran out of juice. Also, no need to constantly remove batteries to prevent them from corroding! The indicator light flashes when charging and stays lit when it's fully charged, so you know it's done. Rechargeable batteries these days actually have a good life span and I'm hoping that will be the case here, but only time will tell. The trimmer head is removeable for easy cleaning and it comes with some oil, so you can add a drop every few uses to keep it running at it's best. It was not very obvious how to remove the trimmer head for cleaning. The manual showed that it could be and it looked like it maybe slid off, but you actually need to apply pressure near the bottom blade area upward to pop it up and off.I found the indicator light to be surprisingly helpful while trimming in a delicate area!If you are in the market for a trimmer, this is a very nice product that gets the job done.",

It\u2019s a nice size for being able to travel with and you don\u2019t have to have a big case to carry with you wherever you go. It\u2019s rechargeable and cordless so you don\u2019t have to worry about keeping a cord plugged in. Lovely trimmer",

The device was easy to use, charge it for about 1hr-2 and will last you about a week depending on how much you use it. add the clip guard before you begin, then simply click the power button and shave away. It provides a close shave with no irritation. It comes with a clip guard, usb charging cable and cleaning brush. To clean just use the brush and brush off excessive hairs/dead skin, enjoy !",

It comes with a cord for charging and a spacer. There are two ends, the one end that looks like a regular trimmer and the other end to get a very close shave.I first used the trimmer end and then used the other end to finish and it did a wonderful job that gave me the closest shave I've ever had with an electric trimmer.The trimmer and accessories come with a pouch for storing away and it all comes in a very nice presentation box which would be great for gifting.I feel the Beach Hottie Bikini Trimmer is an excellent value for the money.",
