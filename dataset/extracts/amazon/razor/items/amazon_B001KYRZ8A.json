                "reviewText": "I have been using the Schick Silk Effects razor since the mid 90's and this razor was a blessing during my military training days when I only had five minutes to shower. I could easily shave fast (light pressure), with zero nicks, scrapes, or razor burn. It has been my go to razor (25+ years) and the BEST razor! Yes is has only TWO blades, but it works better than four blades in my opinion. The wire protector does a great job keeping you from cuts and scrapes - unless you are applying too much pressure. In that case, you will cut yourself with any razor. The blades are designed specifically to keep you from doing that.I was very disappointed to see the stores stop carrying the refill blades, and in my case in stores near me, the razor itself. When I found the razor and refills here on Amazon, I was over the moon! Needless to say, I have been purchasing both ever since.",
