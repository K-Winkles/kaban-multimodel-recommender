                "reviewText": "First and foremost don't buy a razor if it's not Sharp with that being said these are Sharp and anyone who complains about that should just go to an expert. I wanted to try these razors because I have a really hard time using the typical flat ones and I really enjoyed using this. Even being careful it's easy to cut yourself with any razor, I would highly recommend using a good face oil to not only prep the area that you're going to shave but also to put on the blade before and after you use a good oil will help the blade move smoothly over your skin and it will also help prevent bacteria from getting into the follicles after being shaved. The oil will also help keep your blades clean and from rust. I use a jojoba oil but I'm sure all of oil or whatever else people use would work just fine. I also like the flat ones that are being offered on here as well because they're long. I recently noticed that I have tiny white hairs around the openings of my nose and around allergy season my nose won't stop itching so I started shaving them and it's helped a lot I bought these for my eyebrows but I tried using them on my nose and I absolutely love how these work more than the typical flat ones. The long ones I use on the peach fuzz above my lip. I'm glad I tried these out I definitely will get more in the future.",

I've worked long and hard to grow my brows and I only pluck hair that's never going to fit the right shape. However, to shape my brows, I need a small, sharp, easy to use razor. And that is remarkably hard to find. However, these razors are fantastic. I use a stellar brow and lash formula that's so good I grow peach fuzz on my eyelids and beneath my lower lashes. The t-shaped razor is amazing for not only fitting into tight spaces to precisely shape my brows, it's sharp enough to get the peach fuzz so everything is soooooo smooth. The straight razor is fantastic as well. I have A LOT of peach fuzz and it took all of it off with one pass. I strongly recommend using a non-irritating hyaluronic acid to help the blades glide across your face because they're so sharp, it's easy to end up cutting yourself.",
