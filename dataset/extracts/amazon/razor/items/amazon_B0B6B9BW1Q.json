Has a good battery life and will get through whatever job you're doing. Isn't too big or chunky in your hand.I do wish there was a comb attachment that allowed a longer length than the two provided.But save your money on the nose trimmer attachment. It sucks. You gotta sit there forever and try to finesse it to trim anything. Then it gets hot and you have to wait to try again.If you buy this version for the extra blade, then it's worth it, but not for the nose trimmer.",

My favorite thing about this shaver is how easy it is to use. I love that it's waterproof. My only complaint would be the battery life, however, it's very easy to charge. Great budget trimmer.",
