They do not cut me or nick me or irritate my skin at all feels like baby smooth skin afterwards and this is coming from somebody who has thick coarse hair I don\u2019t know if somebody purchased from the wrong seller and I accidentally put the bad reviews on here because I seriously have no regrets on purchasing them they are not a knock offs I have the real ones at home to compare them to, there the samething why spend more when you can spend less for the same product!!",
