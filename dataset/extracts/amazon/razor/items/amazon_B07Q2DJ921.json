Then it started shaving with two three, four five blade razors and couldn't figure out why my face was breaking out. Then I grow a beard for like 20 years. And my beard turned white so I had to start shaving again. Again. 2,3,4,5 blade razor blades same effect ingrown hairs, face breaking out.My first one I bought it a Marshalls, it was eight bucks and had five blades. He had to take apart the top of it and put the blade in and screw the handle on, didn't like it because it felt dangerous. Just because of the single blade. Blade razor blades are just ungodly sharp. Got this one old school screw together clamshell kind of thing blade slides in, or drops in, tighten the handle up from the bottom and you're done. Absolutely amazingly close shave, you just can't go sideways. And I don't mean just a little bit. You can't go sideways at all. So if you actually know how to shave just things a champ. I like it, will not go back to the two, three, four, five blade razors. And it's cheap. The handle will last you a lifetime and razor blades are cheap. Can't go wrong",

                "reviewText": "If you can shave with any ol razor you have in the past, you can shave with this 1. AND you'll get the closeness of a straight razor. Replacement blades are SO much cheaper, and hairs evacuate the razor easily. Can get baby smooth through longer unkept hair in a single swipe easily. Is double sided so if one side is feeling dull or if it's got hair in it and your in a hurry, just flip sides and you'll get another swipe without having to go back to the running water. Intuitive product, replacing blades requires only 2 brain cells, I counted. Just don't be stupid and swipe parallel to the blade edge, always perpendicular. Like cmon you wouldn't do that with any other razor.. and a final positive note is that when you put it down on the counter the blade isn't touching the counter surface - this insures that those granite counter tops aren't prematurely dull your blade when you put it down. So, treat yo self! You'll save money and get a better shave than you are right now. 10/10 A++ simple and effective and economical. What are you doing still reading this? Hit that buy button before I do for you!!!.........NOWWW! :) cheers",

                "reviewText": "I really like the design, ease of setup, and the high quality shave with this razor. This safety razor gives you around 24-36 hours of closer shave than your typical multi-blade cartridge shaver. I won't go back to cartridge shavers and really like using this one. One negative though. After experiencing 10-15 micro cuts with each shave even after 4-5 shaves I was thinking of upgrading from this shaver. However, I read comments from someone saying to pitch the provided blades in favor of others. I bought a variety pack for a few dollars with some of the highest rates blades and didn't have this issue. Irritation on the neck was also way down. I'd give this purchase a 5 star if they weren't sabotaging their own product with poorly performing \"free\" blades. I'll make this suggestion to them. For now, I don't see a reason to spend $50+ on a different safety razor. I'm quite happy with this one now that I upgraded the blades. Feather brand blades is what I tried thus far. I do recommend using a higher quality shaving cream with the safety razor for the first pass shave and then I use a cheap brand cream for the second pass shave against the grain.",

I decided to give this a try so that he can experience the good old safety razor, and find out if it is for him. He was brave enough to try it a couple of times. However, he has sensitive skin and started developing rash after the shave. He eventually switched to a Gillette Mach 3 and is quite happy with it.That got me interested in trying this. I am quite happy with it.The build quality is quite good. I think I can use it for a long time. I threw away my old safety razor which was over 20 years old, and was gathering dust.",

I also prefer the long handle over the short. I'm 82 years old and like this type of shaving. This is how my father shaved and I did the same as a teenager.",

                "reviewText": "El rastrillo lleg\u00f3 bien empacado en una caja de cart\u00f3n duro que sirve para transportarlo sin que se maltrate, trae 10 hojas en su cajita de cart\u00f3n, una pegatina, instrucciones, tarjeta de agradecimiento de compra y una peque\u00f1a brocha para limpiar el rastrillo. Se nota que es una compa\u00f1\u00eda que se preocupa por la calidad, no obstante la maquinilla es hecha en china, se ve bien terminada, suena algo aunque se cierre bien, No indica que metal es pero pareciera acero y da la apariencia como tipo pavonado que mas bien es como barniz negro brillante, el mango es largo con cuadritos lo que que da un buen agarre y ayuda a manejar el rastrillo, tiene un lado en que sale la hoja un poco mas para un corte mas agresivo, su hechura no es tan robusta y se alcanza a escuchar como va cortando la hoja, la cual viene muy bien afilada . No s\u00e9 si se debe al tipo de acabado pero con este rastrillo necesit\u00e9 mas jab\u00f3n para rasurar que con otra maquinilla de acero inoxidable pulido. Como el rastrillo se enjuaga para quitar los restos de jab\u00f3n y barba, los componentes quedan h\u00famedos y no s\u00e9 hasta donde llega el agua, pero por si las dudas lo trato de secar y dejar colgado con el mango hacia arriba para que escurra y no llegue a oxidarse. En General me gust\u00f3 y la relaci\u00f3n precio-calidad me pareci\u00f3 razonable.",

Another reason to like this is because of how good the shaving experience is (no cuts, no irritation and really smooth on the skin). Another thing is that it comes with a small brush (which is appreciated) to clean it whenever you change the blades. Overall this is something that I would 100% recommend.",
