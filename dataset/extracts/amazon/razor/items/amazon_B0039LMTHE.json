                "reviewText": "I have to take a moment to review a product that just works well. I'm a 30-something year old black female who only uses razors to shave my underarms, legs, and girly bits. I shave my legs twice per week, my underarms once per week, and my girly (front and underside) once per week. My skin can be pretty sensitive so I do the whole prep with homemade shaving oils on my girly bits as a pre-conditioner while I shower, then I rinse that off, apply shaving cream, and then shave away creating fun patterns and designs, or just taking it all off depending on my mood. As you can imagine, this process can create quite a buildup on razors, so I've been on the hunt for the perfect cost-effective blades. I've tried razors from both Schick and Gillette that had 2, 3, 4, and 5 blades with mixed results. Double blades give me razor burn and rashes due to how frequently I have to go over areas. Razors with 5 blades were too expensive and also got gunked up very quickly by the variety of products I used. Arguably, I could have probably avoided using products, but with the blades so close together, I fear that I still would have had issues anyhow. Anyhow, 3 and 4 blade razors have ended up being the only ones I could use without problems. These systems have their blades spaced appropriately apart to prevent buildup and allow me to clean the blades when I'm done. They also remove almost all of my hair with one swipe, and they don't cut or irritate my skin. For my money, the Schick Quattro and the Gillette Mach3 are the only two systems that I'm perfectly happy with using. I don't need batteries or anything fancy to get my shave on.On my underarms and legs, I just use shaving cream and a razor- and I do them first. Then, on my girly bits, I use the pre-conditioning oils, then a wash, followed by shaving cream and a razor. After my body shave, I add soap to a soft toothbrush and gently scrub my blades from the front and the back. Then rinse and dry well and put away in a drawer until next time. With this regimen, my blades have remained sharp. They have not developed any rust. And I change my blades on the first of the month every month. I could probably go a little longer without doing so, but given my regimen, I feel that it's safer to do it this way. For the price, a pack of these blades can last me over a year and cost me less than a couple of bucks each month. Not a bad deal. I have no complaints about these blades.I have seen some on ebay that seem a little questionable. I wouldn't feel comfortably buying them there, as I'd worry about getting third-party blades, rather than geniune OEM blades. But the ones I received here on Amazon were genuine Gillette blades and excellent quality. I will definitely purchase these again.",
