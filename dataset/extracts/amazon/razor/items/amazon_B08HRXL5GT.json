                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. So I bought my original Joy razor at Walmart. I got it because there is five girls in my house and everyone was using the same exact razor. It doesn\u2019t help when 4 of them would forget to take their razor out of the shower and then end up getting mixed up. Then the sisterly arguments ensued about it because they were buying their own blades and of course they are expensive. I bought 2 blue, 2pink, and 1 purple for myself. It ended the family feud. I was on Amazon one day looking for a specific eye brow pen and an ad for the razor refills popped up. My jaw hit the floor! At Walmart, for 4 razor refills it is a little over $9 for four of them. They also have an online seller that has the 12 pack but for $49.88!! The 8 pack is $33.88! Absolutely insane! I haven\u2019t purchased them anywhere else since! Now Joy has Pink, Yellow, Teal Blue and Purple!! Too bad I didn\u2019t look online for other color variations back then. One thing I know for sure is that the quality of the razor blade cannot be beat in my book. I\u2019ve tried just about every one made, and I didn\u2019t ever get the close, smooth shave I get with the Joy. First, a 5 blade razor is my go-to and while there are other razors that have 5 blades, they have so much bulk around the blades that you really are only using 4 because the 5th blade is tucked away under the lip of the head. So why bother. It\u2019s to fancy up the lube strip, making it look appealing. It\u2019s really a marketing tactic in my opinion. The joy is thin and streamlined. It is designed to use all 5 blades and for a seamless stroke. It also has a lubricant strip that allows for a sheer stroke over your skin. As long as I take it out of the shower and put it back in my box strip side up, I can get 5 shaves from one blade before the strip is no longer effective. However, I have also been in between shipments and used conditioner as a substitute shaving gel, and the blades went two more shaving rounds. Note , I am a blonde and GH Ave very thin fine hair so someone who has courser hair may not get as many shaves as I do, but I would bet the bank on at minimum getting 4. All in all, Joy is an excellent choice for a razor, and I am one happily shaven woman after finding this deal through Amazon!",
