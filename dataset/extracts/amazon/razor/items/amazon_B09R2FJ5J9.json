                "reviewText": "I got a Leaf Twig about a year ago and that kit came with one of these. The 50ct razors lasted well over 6 months. I shave roughly 3-4 times a week and am an all over shaver, so each blade gets a pretty good workout before I change it. If you ask google how long a single blade safety razor lasts, it'll tell you 5-6 shaves. For a body shaver that's a lot more real estate than just a face, so I change mine about every 2.5 shaves. I did try Shark blades for a bit, but I had to change those every shave and I was getting nicks and ingrown hairs. Those were the only brand I tried before going right back to these.",
