                "reviewText": "I've been shaving with double edge safety razors for over a year now and have experimented with a LOT of blades. The Shark Super Stainless line is one of the better values in the shaving world. They're sharp, smooth and last several shaves. I recently bought a Leaf Twig and now a Leaf Thorn, both of which use single edge blades that are simply DE blades snapped in half. That way you don't have to use proprietary blades that often are expensive and/or are hard to find. I snapped a couple of Shark blades in half to use in my Twig but remembered that Shark offers them already cut in half, so I ordered these. Same great quality. Plenty sharp, a fantastic bargain. If you only use each blade once, it's still only a nickel per shave. I highly recommend these for shavers who use the Leaf line of razors.",

                "reviewText": "Cost: Even if you buy a $200 razor handle to go with these you will still be spending less than on the big name razors. Not only are they inexpensive but they do a fantastic job. I've had the same box of razors for over a year and a half and it still has plenty of blades to go.Sharpness: My standard routine is twice a week shaving (unless there is some sort of big to-do on Tuesday) and I make a point to change the blade weekly. Even with 3 days of growth the blades stay sharp enough to avoid nicks, though admittedly trying to push it more than that is a bad idea. If for some reason I switch to a daily routine I still get a solid week of shaves from each blade before having to discard. Because they are razors I've also used them to cut all sorts of tags, shirts strings, and other random stuff (after shaving with them) and had no issues at all.Quality: The miniature box and individual wrapping is all that is needed to keep a blade safe. They mostly sit in a medicine cabinet with stints on the counter or in a travel bag. I've yet to open a single blade that looks anything but brand new - no rust, dulling, or issues even though the box has gotten light water splashed on it a few times.Other: Set aside the price for a minute and consider how much room 100 of the Quattro or Mach 3 blades would take up! This box of 100 occupies that space of about 4 of them. You'll have room and money for all sorts of other accessories.",
