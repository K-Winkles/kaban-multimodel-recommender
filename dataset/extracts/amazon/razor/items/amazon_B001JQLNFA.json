Ran out when decided to try the these. Wow!! Y\u2019all, let me just say that this does not need shaving cream. You can use it, but the moisturize barrier ALONE creates this filmy creamy like barrier for your skin while shaving. Couldn\u2019t even feel the blades lol for a second I thought maybe the guard was still on or something. Got my so smooth! That white tea moisturize strip is the truth! As it wears down, I just use the satin care shave cream to create some slip and glide. Thanks so much for this.",

                "reviewText": "I recently tried the Gillette Venus ComfortGlide White Tea Women's Razor, and I was pleasantly surprised by the overall shaving experience. Here are my detailed thoughts:What I Appreciate:Gentle on Skin: The ComfortGlide feature is true to its name. It glides smoothly over the skin, reducing the risk of nicks and cuts. The added moisture bars are a bonus, especially for those with sensitive skin.Refreshing Scent: The white tea scent adds a subtle and refreshing touch to the shaving process, making it more of a pampering experience.Easy to Handle: The ergonomic design of the handle makes it easy to grip and maneuver around curves and hard-to-reach areas.Convenience of Refills: The inclusion of two refills in the package is convenient, saving the hassle of immediate repurchases.Notable Drawback:Blade Longevity: The major downside I noticed is the longevity of the blades. They tend to dull quicker than expected, leading to a need for more frequent replacements. This can be a bit of a letdown for those expecting the blades to last longer, considering the brand's reputation for quality.Final Thoughts:The Gillette Venus ComfortGlide White Tea Razor offers a smooth, pleasant shaving experience with its skin-friendly features and delightful scent. However, the shorter lifespan of the blades is something to consider, especially for regular users. It's a great choice for those prioritizing comfort and ease of use, but if blade longevity is a major factor for you, you might find the need for frequent replacements a bit inconvenient.",
