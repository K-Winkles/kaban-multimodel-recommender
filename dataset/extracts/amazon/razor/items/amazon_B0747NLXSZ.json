Once there, you need to hold the sharp edge at a 30-degree edge. Just be mindful that you do not need to apply any weight when you shave and allow the sturdy design of the blade do the work itself. Ultimate Shaving Experience Our superior design is expertly weighted, agreeable in your grasp, and gives you more noteworthy control and adjust than numerous different razors available. Say goodbye to cuts and scratches. Save razor consumption and welcome an additional nearby wrap-up to your shaving accessories. Ideal for a touchy skin.",

I got this because I have a very thick beard and let it grow a bit between shavings and it\u2019s impossible to use a safety razor once it grows beyond a certain length.This has been the perfect solution. It glides right through my heavy beard.If you\u2019re in a similar situation, you may want to give it a try. But anyone who shaves daily would probably not need it and would be better served with a safety razor.UPDATE: I just shaved my head. Not bad results for the first time. Few nicks. The trick is to start with the blade nearly flat against your skin and then angle the blade to 30 degrees as you stroke. So you\u2019re alway approaching your face with the blade flat.Good luck!",

                "reviewText": "I've been using a straight-edge razor for a little over a year now using a typical \"old fashioned\" blade and decided to give this a shot for a variety of reasons.The price: You get what you pay for. I paid $9.99 for this razor and 100 derby blades. The razor itself, or razor caddy to be more specific, is decent. It's stainless steel and of good construction. The blade is held firmly in place just as it should be. The problem is that the two dots for alignment inside the enclosure are slightly off so the edge of the blade is at a different angle than the edge of the caddy, they should be parallel and they're not. This seems like a minor problem, but when you're working with something that is barely extending beyond the edge of the caddy, you have to use the caddy for alignment on your face either by sight or touch - but this creates a perception problem and if you're not extra careful you'll end up slicing your face/neck instead of shaving it. If the alignment were better, this would be a superb product. Perhaps mine is just faulty? Your mileage may vary.Speaking of slicing your neck, this brings me to the Derby blades that came with it. My first shave with it went well - just as I'm accustomed to with my prior razor. It took a few strokes before I realized the alignment problem, but once that was figured out I was able to adjust. My second shave was a decidedly different story. If you've never used a single, ultra-sharp blade before, then you may not realize that when something is THIS sharp you don't feel pain right away when you cut yourself. That was what happened with the second shave - my neck was sliced in many places. Once the blood started flowing from multiple cuts, I stopped and inspected what was going on. The blade had a nick in it. Because the first didn't, I assumed this was a fluke. I took the blade out and put a new one in, only to realize this 3rd blade was nicked also. I then opened up 10 more of the individually wrapped blades and 7 of them had flaws that would cause this problem. Out of the 13 total blades that I have opened so far, 9 of them were unusable for shaving. The box containing the blades was slightly askew when I received it, and was definitely damaged during shipping but the blades looked fine until I inspected them specifically looking for imperfections in the blade edge. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that this is not their quality control but was instead a shipping issue, but I recommend you be very careful if you do order this product. They're delicate.Doing further research it seems Derby blades are far from ideal. Their thinness accounts for how easily they're damaged and become unusable. Even the undamaged blades only gave a really good shave for 3/4's of my face/neck before dulling. I am able to complete a full shave, but it's less smooth near the end due to the rapid dulling of the blade. Some people report getting a second shave from each one, maybe I was just spoiled with how long my standard straight-edge was able to hold a shave-ready edge.Short version: Quality of the blades is lacking, find different blades to use with the caddy. Quick research will show you the best alternatives. The razor/caddy is good, but would be great if it held the blade parallel for easier use.",

Se necesita algo de pr\u00e1ctica para evitar Cortes, pero los resultados son notablemente mejor que con otras t\u00e9cnicas de afeitado (queda m\u00e1s al raz y mejor delineada la barba y el bigote)",
