It seems like the head is more flexible and followed the contours of my skin better than my usually shaver. It glides over skin smoothly and even shaving my knees was no issue as it just adapted to the bony surface and did it's job. The best part though, no redness, no irritation, no rash on my bikini area! Even the next day skin still looked great with none of those bumps, pimples, whatever you want to call them. Will be replacing my current shaver with this as one it is better priced and two it actually did a better job.",

While they did deliver on the comfort aspect, I found that they didn't quite live up to my expectations in terms of closeness. Don't get me wrong, they're still a good option for those looking for a gentle razor, but if you're expecting a super smooth finish, you might want to look elsewhere. Another thing to note is that the blades can become dull fairly quickly, so you may need to replace them more often than you'd like.",

So it seems I have to go over some areas more than once. Due to this, the razors won't stay sharp as long and I will likely only get 2 shaves at best out of 1.Overall, my impression is positive since these did not leave any irritation after using.I did not accidentally nick myself either and it was easy to get into tricky areas.I just wish these shaved a little more hair in one stroke as I had to swipe the same area a few times instead of a one stroke shave.",
