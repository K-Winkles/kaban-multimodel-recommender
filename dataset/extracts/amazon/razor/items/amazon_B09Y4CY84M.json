                "reviewText": "Works much better than Tinkle razors. The only improvement would be to make the handles out of bamboo instead of plastic.Update after using a couple months: I took two stars away because half of the razors had to be thrown away. After using the larger razors, I tried the small ones. I kept cutting myself, so I looked at the blades. The plastic handle bumps out just enough so that the blade is angled, not flat, and the sharp point at the end of the razor makes the most contact with your skin. So there's no way to get the blade flat against your skin and you end up gouging yourself. I would like to see a package of the large razors only.",

It is completely safe to do yourself at home. I immediately set off to look for some here on Amazon. I ran across this pack of 6. They were a reasonable price. The box had instructions & said where all you could use the dermaplane tool. These worked really well. They removed the hairs without leaving my face scratched or itchy. The tools left my face ready & able to absorb my skincare products & ensure my makeup went on flawlessly. I definitely recommend these to anyone facing the same problem.",

Bewertung EVER !Ich bin eine 43 j\u00e4hrige wei\u00dfblonde Frau, mit sehr viel Gesichtsflaum seit ich denken kann. Vor allem an den Wangen zum Hals abw\u00e4rts.Andere sehen ihn nicht, sagen sie, aber ich kann meine cremes und Makeup nie problemlos auftragen. Au\u00dferdem leide ich immer wieder unter entz\u00fcndungen/Verdickungen, wo neue Haare heraustreten.Ich habe wax in allen Varianten probiert, enthaarungsCremes etc etc. Alles hat meine Haut unfassbar gesch\u00e4digt und dauerte Wochen, bis alle Stellen wieder verheilt waren.Ich hatte Angst mir mit klingen durchs Gesicht zu fahren, aber die Rezensionen haben mir Mut gemacht und ich mich getraut.Und: was soll ich sagen! Man glaubt es nicht, wieviel Babyfell aus dem Gesicht kommt, wie leicht es geht, wie v\u00f6llig unproblematisch es f\u00fcr die Haut ist und keine sch\u00e4den entstehen.Wenn der Effekt jetzt auch noch lange anh\u00e4lt bin ich \u00fcbergl\u00fccklich.Einfach absolut empfehlenswert",
