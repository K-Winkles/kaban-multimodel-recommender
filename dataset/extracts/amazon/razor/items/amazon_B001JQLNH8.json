                "reviewText": "I typically don't use disposable razors at home, but when I'm on a multi-day through hike every ounce counts. I've tried a number of twin and single blade disposables I picked up at various drug stores, but they usually start carving up my face after the first use and sometimes with the first use because they don't pivot around curves.This triple blade razor always lasts through 3 days of shaving and gives me an incredibly close shave while pivoting to the curves of my face. I also like that the handle is very light and the fact that I can get several days of use out of it means I save on pack weight. I haven't tried going longer than 3 days, but I'm sure if I did it would still be a better experience than the typical disposables I've used in the past.",
