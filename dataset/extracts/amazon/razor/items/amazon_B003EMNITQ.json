I bend one direction, my butt sends the shower stall door flying open and I flood my bathroom. I bend in the other direction, I am knocked in the head by the oversized faucet handles. I live alone. I can't risk bleeding out or a slip and fall in the bathroom due to shaving shenanigans so I need my razors to work and work well. These do the trick. So if shaving is a perilous task for you too, I highly recommend Venus. That is all. Godspeed, fellow risk-takers...",
