None compared; and I was almost close to buying more from Sephora until I decided to give amazon a try. These are just as the same for a third of the price and ten times more razors. Love these! Even my boyfriend uses them and loves them as his barber always misses the peach fuzz on his cheekbones. Highly recommend",

They have worked perfectly for upper lip dark hair removal without balding, they work great for the first after-3-months-no-shaving clean up, and I love the disposability.",
