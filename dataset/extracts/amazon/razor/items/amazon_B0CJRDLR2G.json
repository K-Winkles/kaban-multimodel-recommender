                "reviewText": "This dermaplaning tool is different from products I've previously used because instead of throwing away the whole thing when the razor gets dull, this one has a removable and replaceable blade head. The reusable metal handle is strong. The blade is very effective at removing hair and dead skin cells, leaving the skin very smooth.For some reason I can't seem to see explained in the product listing or instructions, the handle is hollow and both the top and bottom screw off to access the hollow inside. This is not part of the head replacement process, as that slides on separately from the screw off opening. The extra replacement heads do not fit instead for storage, so that can't be the reason either. It's a mystery to me.",

This is a nice set, as the handle is heavy and seems to be nicer quality compared to what I've been using. It comes with a blade attached and 3 more blades. There are also instructions and a customer satisfaction card.It states to replace the blade after 4 uses, so that would give you 16 uses in this package. The only thing I'd mention is to be careful when changing the blades. They're easy to change, but they do sort of fly off so just prepared and watch for that.",
