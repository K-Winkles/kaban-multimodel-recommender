        "description": "Venus female razor blades are designed with a woman\u2019s body in mind. From handles designed for a comfortable grip to pivoting heads that contour to your body, Venus razors are designed to help reveal touchably smooth skin. Venus Deluxe Smooth Sensitive women\u2019s blade refills are perfect for protecting your sensitive skin. These razor blades feature 5 diamond-like coated blades for a long-lasting smooth shave and a SkinElixir lubrastrip with a touch of Aloe Vera for glide that releases a perfect dose of protection you can feel with up to 0% irritation*. The SkinElixir lubrastrip activates when wet, providing your sensitive skin with a perfect dose of protection from nicks, cuts and irritation while shaving. The blade refills for women also feature a pivoting head that adjusts to your curves, including ankles and knees. No awkwardly angling your razor. Its platinum metal handle is designed to last so you can be in total control and keeping the handle for 5 years vs 1 year equals 80% less waste so that you can get the most out of your shave. Enjoy a smooth and close shave with a razor that really understands your sensitive skin. Each blade refill lasts up to 30 days of smooth shaves (based on twice/week shave); just use and replace when you're ready for a new one. Did you know that any Venus blade refill fits any Venus razor handle (except Simply Venus and Venus Pubic Hair Razor)? The handle is designed to last so you only need to change your blades",

I have super sensitive skin & shaving has always been problematic for me because of this, therefore, EVERY shaver I've used since I was 11-12 has been problematic. I've even used shaving gel for sensitive skin, but that doesn't work. I saw this on sale at Walgreens & thought well, it's a Venus, must be good, so I'll give it a try. BUY IT. BEST I'VE EVER USED. TRUST ME. Oh, the shaving gel I use is Skintimate Coconut Delight. (I'm obsessed with anything coconut.) I don't care if it's gonna cost me $20 reg price, it's worth it for years of shaving cuts & problems.",
