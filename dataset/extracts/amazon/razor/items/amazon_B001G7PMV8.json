                "reviewText": "Let's face it (see what I did there?): Most razor companies won't be happy until they find a way to fit 13 blades on the head of a cartridge so they can charge $20 each. We've been told over the years \"the more blades the smoother the shave\". They even created cool little animations showing defenseless little hairs being decapitated at pore level. This may be great for those of us who have very stubborn stubble and require our shave to be so close that a five o'clock shadow doesn't show up until 2023. However, most human beings don't need more than one blade. We've been led to believe that this is a necessity because our parents and our grandparents and our great-grandparents used a single blade and that was simply archaic if not straight out of the Neanderthal age. We might as well be shaving with a hunting knife like Crocodile Dundee if we're using anything less than 4 blades. I'm here to tell you that may not be your case. If you have hair that is anything like mine, even on the top of your head and in other places on your body, you don't need more than two blades at the most.If you've all but given up on replacement cartridges and quadruple blade infusions and machs and turbos and all that other crap, maybe it's time to go back to basics and try regular old disposable twin blade razors. Worst case scenario if you don't like them you can always give them to a family member.And let's not discount the ladies who enjoy shaving with what is supposed to be a men's razor. Nobody says these have to be specifically for men. If I can shave every part of my body with them, so can you.Also, just because these things are disposable doesn't mean they aren't sharp as hell. I will keep buying these until they stop making them.",

                "reviewText": "This is the BEST 2 bladed razor made. I dislike the \"157 blade\" razors in the market place. I find that the 3,4 and 5 blade razors give no closer or better shave and are cumbersome to shave with, as you can't get into the small areas around the nose and mouth... and I won't buy them. I used to buy these at Costco, but they got sucked into the \"157 blade\" razors, so I've turned to Amazon and I order them in bulk.Just as a foot note: After not being able to get two-bladed razors, out of frustration I decided to go back to basics. I ordered a Parker 99R double edge safety razor (the kind that my grandfather used -- yes they still make those) from Amazon for $30 bucks. I did not care for the blades it came with, so I read some reviews and ordered Feather Double Blades for replacements (the best made). Cost...wait for it...50 blades will run you $14.35 on Amazon Prime. I use a blade a week, so that will last a year!In addition, I ordered Williams Mug Shaving Soap (Amazon Prime $6.09 for 3 bars -- lasts me about a year) , a shaving cup (AKStore Men's Durable Shave Soap Cup / $6.99 on Amazon Prime). I splurged a little of a genuine silver tipped badger shaving brush, as I recall about $40.00 on Amazon. Now, I don't add to the over 100 million shaving cans that are in landfills every year, let alone the cost savings.There was a little bit a learning curve to using a safety razor without cutting myself to death, but now I do it as easily as a disposable razor. The big thing, it is THE CLOSEST AND BEST SHAVE OF MY LIFE!!!",

                "reviewText": "A few weeks ago I had gone back to the old system of the metal handle that opens up for you to insert a disposable double-edged razor blade. It was a lot cheaper than the modern plastic all-in-one disposables and I had used it until the age of 19 or so. The merkur handle was fine but believe it or not the blades (no matter what brand) were way too sharp and shredded my face - lots of blood and cuts where I had NEVER been cut with a modern plastic disposable (Maybe now that I'm older my skin is thinner - I don't know). I toughed it out for over a month thinking I just had to get use to it but I finally saw it wasn't me. I mean these things were surgical scalpels! And I used great shaving cream and soaked my face first with hot water. Even if I cleaned the blood up perfectly I would still find VERY noticeable dried blood spots a couple of hours later that looked awful. Far, far, far more bleeding than I ever had with any disposable. So I went to Amazon and grabbed these as they were a nice balance of high reviews at a decent price. OMG. Truly the best shave I ever had. I hadn't shaved in 4 days and I didn't even use shaving cream (I hate using it cos I can't tell exactly where the blades are landing - I have a goatee). I am staying with these for as long as they are available. With the double-edged too-sharp system I had DREADED shaving. With these I give it no more thought than getting my breakfast. Go Gillette and Amazon!",

                "reviewText": "I've used Mach 3 blades to shave for years and years. But I saw this offer for these 2 bladed razors at less than half the cost of the Mach 3 blades. All I can say is wow! The shave was basically just as good as the Mach 3 - actually I had less skin irritation with one less blade. And it is kinda nice to get a fresh handle instead of having to reuse the same handle that I've used for 10 years, which is getting really worn out. And at less then half the cost, you really can't go wrong. The best way to not cut yourself with any razor is to not push to hard. If you have to push hard to get the razor to cut, your blades are dull, and you should use a new razor.",
