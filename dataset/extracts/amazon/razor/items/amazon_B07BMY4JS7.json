May be better if you take out of the shower, dry, and keep away from shower. Not sure if it is used up fast on your skin or if it is dissolving in shower on it's own.",

Initially i thought it was too bulky like. I was hesitant about using it. The 1st swipe was AMAZING. I couldn't believe how smooth. It removed ALL hairs on that 1st swipe. BEST ones yet. I will be purchasing this one from now on.",
