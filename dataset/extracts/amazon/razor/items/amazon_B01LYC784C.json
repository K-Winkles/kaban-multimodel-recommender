Wet shave makes a significant psychological difference to get you in a good state of mind in the morning or bring you back to balance after the tough day at work. Compare to electric shavers, safety razors make your hairy face perfectly clean. It's very easy to clean remained beard on razor head, give you more hygiene and health. How to shave? Here's 4 Essential Steps: 1. Before shave, Splash your face with hot water to soften your bristly hairs. Use a wash cloth to pat dry. Use a pre-shave essential oil to prepare a smooth razor glide for your hairy face. 2. Lather Up, Use a badger brush to apply shaving cream or lather up with some traditional shaving soap. 3. Shave, Dip a clean, sharp blade in hot water, avoid applying pressure and shave with the grain. Try adjusting the angle to find out the most suitable ways for your skin. Wash your blade often. 4. Moisturize, Use after-shave balm to revitalize and soothe your newly smooth, dry skin. Be careful with the blade! This blade is made of Swedish or Japanese Steel 6CR13. Blades will slice you right open if you're not careful. Its bodacious sharpness also gives you a closer shave. Blades should not be drown in the water, better kept in dry condition for the long lasting. For safety, Please keep them away from children.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars VERY impressed - why have I spent over a decade buying plastics?!?",
                "reviewText": "This is amazing. Just buy a pack of 100 blades and your set! The blades don't even wear out/get dull very quickly. Nor do they seem to rust as fast as they do on disposable razors. (I think this is due to better \"ventilation\" so water isn't stuck in the razor blade for very long.) I'd worried that only having a single blade on either side instead of being double-bladed on one side might make it harder to shave - not so! This seems to be from the spacing of the razor. Instead of everything being crammed in, there's space beneath for the hair to wash out. Disposable razors make their profit from getting you to buy more as soon as possible, so it doesn't behoove them to \"waste money\" engineering a razor that will be usable more than a couple times. Another plus is that it's \"green\", if that's important to you. You can avoid wasting plastic. And you don't even have to go out of your way to do it like you do with recycling! It saves you money and it saves you trips to the store since you're set for an insanely long time with your blades. There is no downside for you! This is only $10! That's about the after cost of 2 packages of disposable plastic razors. It's just so cheap for something so useful! It's too bad more people don't know of this. And it came with a handy mirrored travel case that you can store a couple extra blades in.I thought it might be hard to use something with a shorter handle than I'm accustomed to but that hasn't been the case. They're handle has been a fine length for shaving in corners (under arms, below, etc.). The grippy-ness of the handle is just right to me. The weight has been perfectly fine, though I don't know how it would be on a version with a longer handle. The only thing I can say here is don't drop it on your foot in the shower, lol. You aren't likely to cut yourself if you do drop it, since the metal bar is mostly in the way, and it would probably only be a nick. But it's heavy, so it's going to be like when you dropped that shampoo bottle on your foot.I admit that sometimes I need a disposable razor for something. I have a spare plastic razor in my pack in case of \"emergency\". The only issue for me has been shaving underarm hair after using deodorant. Deodorant was a real offender with my plastic razors, always clogging them and stuffing them up. Shave once after using deodorant and your plastic razor is ruined! While the great design of this razor prevents the hair that has a coating of deodorant from clogging the entire blade, the hairs are still annoying and the deodorant leaves a thin coating of itself on the head of your razor. I take the blade out and wipe it off with kleenex or a paper towel sometimes. But the coating isn't super noticeable and it's really not a big issue considering the value of the product. Also, I'm certain some people wouldn't even notice this or care about it at all. Maybe I just need to get deodorant! Anyway, awesome product. Very impressed.",

This is unbeatable for the price, better than any other razor I've ever used. It's not luxury, and the build quality isn't micrometer-perfect, but it looks great from more than 2 inches away and the case is handy with a mirror and a space for spare blades.I've been using Astra green blades with this, and getting great results.",

I have tried a few other inexpensive travel razors and found all of them to be too mild for my beard. This one is fairly aggressive and gives me a BBS shave in just two passes. I did have a couple weepers on my neck, but this is always a problem area for me. Maybe just a tad bit less aggressive and it would be perfect. I did not try the included no-name blade that was included, I used Astra Superior Platinum for my first shave since they are a known quantity for me. This wa a good first experience with Baili razors and I'll likely be trying others in the near future to find that perfect razor, but in the meantime this one works quite well.",

This razor is light, so if you don\u2019t like light razors this is not for you. The openings at the base makes it very easy for the shaving gunk to get out of your way and also easy to clean it up. The handle is short and it comes in a nice case so easy to travel with. The best part is the very narrow head that makes it ideal for some that has beard, like myself, since I can easily trim around my beard. I figure that the gold tone finish is bound to fade but who cares is $12 razor that gives you a wonderful shave. If you want something classier try the Boker narrow head but for the money I\u2019m staying with Baili.",

But it was a bit mild, and this one said it was more aggressive - so I gave it a try. Turns out, it is more aggressive, as promised. But the trade-off is more blade feel.The head is based on the vintage Gillette Tech razors, but it has been tweaked a bit. This razor has more blade feel and is more efficient than those old razors. I like the handle too; it gives a better grip than I expected.I have 50 razors; this one isn't going to bump any of my favourites from the top spots. But those top razors cost a lot more, too. At this price point, this is a very good razor. If you're just looking to start shaving with a safety razor and have a thicker beard, or if you like a medium-to-aggressive razor and you're on a budget, this razor will do you just fine. I have razors that cost more that aren't as good.",
