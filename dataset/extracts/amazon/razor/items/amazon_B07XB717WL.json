                "reviewText": "This is a great entry-level razor, especially at the sub-$50 price point. Like most razors at this level, this one does a fine job and is made nicely. But, you MUST open it up and remove the blade after use so it can dry out. Many of these razors can rust out - even if they are anodized or coated like this one.Most people reading this are already into safety razors, so I'll try to describe this in relation to other products.It looks cool and I like the pseudo-Japanese design queues. The handle is textured and easy to grip - I never have to worry about dropping it in the shower. It's a butterfly, so that's a thing if it matters to you. I've owned several adjustables and this one does well, again - great for someone getting into this at such a price point. I started at a 1 and worked my way up. By 3 with a Derby blade, it didn't really perform as well as I like. But that's just my personal experience - everybody's different.Being an adjustable, this is a great razor for new people to experiment with aggression and see what they like best. I think it's great as a gift for your kids first razor or a novelty for a husband. If you already own a few adjustables - you know exactly what you're getting. Past that, it's all personal preference.Again, at sub-$50 you can't go wrong with what you get here.",

                "reviewText": "I got this as a replacement for the handle that I had been using from another brand for years. I love the look of this razor first of all. Beautiful right out of the box and the butterfly closure is a really cool touch. I use the side without the nubs as it provides this smoothest one pass that gets every hair with the most minimal of effort very quickly. The look of the razor is awesome and it does a fantastic job. Extremely happy with it and worth of money",

                "reviewText": "First, this razor is NOT for beginners. This razor bounces between a 3 star and a 5 star based on blades, skill and concentration. What I do like, is this razor has heft to it. It feels so nice in the hand. Beautiful craftsmanship in the metal and contrasting colors. I have been using this razor since April 2023, not for every shave, but a lot of them. At first, I kept getting razor burn and TONS of nicks and cuts. I really enjoy shaving but this razor made it hard to love. One day I decided to give this razor the best chance it could have. I usually use the sample blades you get when you buy a razor (I have a ton of them) and this time I decided to use a good quality blade. I also found that this razor needs a SUPER light touch, let the blade do the work. I have been using this razor for consecutive shaves and it gets better every time. Finally, I decided to write this review. With practice and some understanding of this razor it has become one of my favorite razors and now I can't wait to use it. I use it on setting #3 with a quality blade. I look forward to seeing what else Vikings Blade has to offer, I would love to try them all and leave my reviews!... Maybe a discount??? \ud83d\ude01",
