I\u2019m new to using a straight edge razor and I have to say it is easy to pick up (5 minutes after watching a youtube video - don\u2019t be scared! Ignore all the nay sayers about you slashing yourself). There are simple rules : Always keep the blade angled off your skin at around 30 degrees, always keep the blade perpendicular to the direction of travel and don\u2019t force (think dragging vs forcing). If the edge perpendicular to the direction of travel you will slash (think about it!).From a product standpoint, it is a well made handle and the blades are plenty sharp! The handle takes a little bit to figure out from a blade replacement standpoint but there\u2019s plenty of youtube videos to sort you out. The handle is comfortable, ergonomic and a good weight. I would like the handle to be a bit longer but that\u2019s just me, not the product. I used regular shaving foam and the shave is really close, like baby skin close! So much better than the disposable stuff and you\u2019re not filling in landfills with plastic! Our fore-bearers got this right!! And what\u2019s not manly about being able to use a single blade to shave !! Don\u2019t tell the ladies but these shavers/razors would probably be good for leg hairs too !!! \ud83d\ude09",

                "reviewText": "A little embarrassed, over 50 years old and I\u2019ve never used a straight razor ever. Been finding all kinds of shaving soaps and other shaving stuff online lately and wanted to give this a try.I\u2019ve been using their brand pomades for a while, so it was safe to say that the company\u2018s been around for a little while.The razor and blades came in the nice little box, which would make a great gift for someone. Comes with instructions in case you\u2019ve never used a straight razor before\u2026 I had a little bit of an issue reading the print, even with reading glasses.Inserting the single use razors was pretty easy, took me a little bit to figure out how to get them out but with more use it\u2019s becoming easier.Found instructions online on how to hold a straight razor, I was very shaky the very first time, but didn\u2019t cut myself.I was a little nervous about the price being so low but to my surprise it seems a very, very nice quality razor, doesn\u2019t feel cheap in any way.I tried using the single use blades a second time, and the shave was not as good so definitely one shave per razor depending on your facial hair.Im thinking about buying one for my brother as a gift and then another one for my self to keep in my gym bag.The only thing I would change is maybe the printed instructions that would be a little bit easier to read for us older chaps.",

Die Klingen sind sehr scharf und sowohl beim einsetzen und Wechseln der klingen, als auch bei der Nutzung des Messers sollte h\u00f6chste Vorsicht gelten, da ein Schnitt deutlich schneller passieren kann, als man denkt und auch stark bluten k\u00f6nnen.Nun zu meiner eigentlichen Rezension:Ich war bereits seit l\u00e4ngerer Zeit auf der Suche nach einem Rasiermesser, da ich genau so pr\u00e4zise arbeiten wollte wie die Herren beim Friseur und dies mit handels\u00fcblichen rasieren gerade an den Konturen nicht m\u00f6glich ist oder auch einzelne H\u00e4rchen am Kinn nicht leicht zu erreichen sind.In der Drogerie zahlt man knapp das Doppelte und erh\u00e4lt lediglich 4 Wechselklingen, also ein schlechter Witz im Vergleich zu diesem Produkt.Die Verpackung wirkt edel und auch das Rasiermesser selbst ist \u00fcberraschend gut verarbeitet und erledigt seinen Dienst wunderbar.Was mit sehr gut gefallen hat ist, dass noch eine Anleitung f\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger bei liegt wie man das Messer zu nutzen hat und wie man so Verletzungen vorbeugen kann.",
