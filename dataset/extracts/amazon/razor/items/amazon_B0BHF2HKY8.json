                "reviewText": "Update Again: Gave away all of the razors except two. Totally useless to me.Update/See my original review below - a 3-star rating. However, the more I use these the more I realize they clog more than my old razors. I also have to make twice as many passes over each part of my face to get all the hairs/stubble. Luckily, they don't irritate my skin. These are horrible razors, especially for the price. Don't bother.These are great razors, don't get me wrong. Smooth, gentle shave with a large head and easy-grip handle. Very ergonomic. However, after a few passes, the sides of the head were clogging up a bit--not as bad as typical razors, but these are supposed to be anti-clog. Also, it took several passes on my neck under the jaw line to get all of the hairs. So, while the razor is great--it's great like a lot of razors are great. It's not a special razor worth spending extra money on if you're on a budget.",

In order to get this razor to slightly perform, you have to shave the opposite way of any normal razor (aka shave in the direction the hair grows, not against). Even when you do that, it does not provide a clean shave in any capacity. I have never had an issue with a razor before and do NOT recommend this. Save your money!",
