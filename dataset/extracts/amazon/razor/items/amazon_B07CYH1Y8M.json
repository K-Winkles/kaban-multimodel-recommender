It is THE BEST rzaor I have ever used. There is not even a close second. I have only ever used an electric azor a few times, but the batter-powered power in this Fusion5 is terrific -- and I wasn't ever aware of the power feature when I bought this one. A little pricy? Perhaps but so worth whateer costs. Never been happier shaving.",
