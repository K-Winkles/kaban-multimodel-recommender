                "reviewText": "I first heard of these a few years ago and then bought 2 for my girls for their vacation, and after they used theirs for the first time they called me raving about how great they are! So I decided I was due a little spoiling and I bought another for myself. I\u2019d resided to using the packaged disposables for a few years which always felt cheap (bcuz they were) well let me tell you the comparison is like night and day!This new razor is weighted properly and feels good in my hand, literally glides along my skin. The blade feels so smooth and is so easy to maneuver around my leg and knees curves and bones, without even trying. How many times in my 65 years I\u2019ve accidentally skinned the back or outside of my ankle with a razor, enough that I\u2019m always wary when I\u2019m near that spot. But not with this new one, it just floats gently around the area, it\u2019s got to have something to do with its shape and design, it\u2019s just so comfortable to use.It\u2019s also worth mentioning how nice it is to have it hanging on its magnetic holder that sticks to the shower wall with a little dab of putty that\u2019s on the back side \u2026 and that\u2019s movable if you need to do so. If you\u2019re on the fence about getting one, take the jump and get one for yourself, you\u2019ll love it too!",

This Billie razor is amazing, I never realized how much I needed the handle it makes shaving so much easier due to the shape. Also the razor glides so nicely and I notice I don't have to shave daily like with the disposable razors. I will subscribe and have my refill delivered monthly. Love it",

It was easy to place on my shower wall and I no longer need to store my razor in the cupboard until I need to use it.

The product speaks for itself, we don\u2019t need any more packaging & waste to prove it\u2019s worth the money, and this amount of cardboard doesn\u2019t benefit the consumer, we\u2019re pretty sick of dealing with it all frankly so maybe being more environmentally friendly, saving the company some money & saving your customers time is the way to go\u2026",

I have always preferred to not shave at all because it wasn't worth the skin irritation after. This razor is a literal godsend. I paired it with an EOS shave cream and I had shaved my legs and pits that hadn't been shaved in like 6 months. I had zero irritation during or after shaving. I don't often leave reviews but this one needed the review. You won't be disappointed!!",

One of the smoothest and closet shaves i\u2019ve ever got, and TBH i don\u2019t think i even need to use a shaving cream or soap!! First use, didn\u2019t even cut myself, and it\u2019s been years since that\u2019s happened to me. BUY IT",

                "reviewText": "I've used a LOT of different razors, from all different brands, and this has been the best I've ever used. The aloe vera band is insane and makes shaving so smooth and FAST. I don't even have to use shaving cream anymore?? What??! The design is cute and these are super affordable, and WAY better than other brands with the similar reusable handle style (Joy, Flamingo, etc.). Definitely hang up the magnet asap because the aloe gel can seep/melt onto the surface of the shower if you just set it face down. I'm obsessed with this razor and don't want to use anything else!!!",
