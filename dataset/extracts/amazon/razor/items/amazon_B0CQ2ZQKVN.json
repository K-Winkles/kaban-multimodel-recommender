                "reviewText": "I already have tried the 'Billie' Razors before, so I know how great this razor truly is. I wanted to get another, as I really loved the one I had before. So I got this Billie razor in the Sunburst color. What I love about this razor is that it has 5 blades that shave so smoothly, and closely. My skin feels so silky smooth after shaving, I love it! \u2764\ufe0f Also, what's great about this razor is that it has a magnetic mount piece that is easy to assemble in the shower/bath, and the razor stays put on the magnetic mount. So, this way, you never have to worry about it falling off of the side of the shower, or getting rusty super fast from staying in a regular shower caddy. I like that it stays in one place for when I need it next.This starter pack includes the fun colored handle, and the razor part, plus a refill. The Razors are easy to put on/off, and there's also extra adhesive-in case you need it for the magnetic mount. Although, the mount from my first Billie razor is still holding up, from when I installed it 2 months ago. So I'm just using that one for now.. This is a high quality razor that will give a nice, close shave; and hasn't given me any troubles since using. I'm very satisfied with this razor, and would highly recommend it. I feel that the quality, longevity, and close shave really makes this a winner-plus the price is more affordable (in my opinion), than some other well-known brands. Excellent product! \ud83d\ude0a",

                "reviewText": "I've been tempted to try Billie razors for a while, their bright colors are so appealing. So I jumped on the chance to try this starter set!I LOVE the festive color scheme, the bright colors make my shower more fun and wake me up a bit in the morning. The razor itself is surprisingly lightweight. I usually just buy whatever razors are on sale and have been using a men's re-usable razor for a while now. That one is metal and on the heavier side, so this Billie was a nice change. Being lightweight, it could feel cheaply made, but it does not- it feels very well designed. The shape is easy to hold and it glides so smoothly it doesn't even feel like you're shaving.I like the magnetic holder, it is a nice detail to help keep your razor from rusting too quickly/getting gross. I botched the install, waiting until my shower wall had some steam on it so it didn't stick well, but that's user error. The set does come with an extra sticker for the holder, so I will be attempting again with a clean and dry shower wall.My only qualm is the plastic material is very smooth, making it pretty slippery in the shower/with soapy hands. If they added a texture to the handle this would be my go-to razor.",

It's not much easier with dry hands when I get out of the shower, either, because there's no indication of which direction the cartridge is supposed to go.

                "reviewText": "I have tried so many different razor brands over the years and they are all so different. This is my first time trying a razor from the Billie brand.The razor itself is so pretty! The glow in the dark aspect is so different from anything that I have seen before. I have never seen another one like it! Even though I would never be shaving in the dark, it is still cool seeing it glowing in the shower when I walk into the dark bathroom, lol!The handle itself is smooth but has a no slip grip which prevents it from slipping when wet. It actually has some heft to it and doesn't feel at all flimsy, fragile, or cheap.The cartridges are easy to load and remove. They are larger in size making them ideal for shaving my legs and underarms but a little too bulky and cumbersome for my bikini area.I did find that I got a nice, smooth, close shave when using these. Even after several uses, they still shaved well. I didn't experience any irritation, redness, or razor burn after use.The included magnetic shower holder was a nice little bonus. It has a sticky adhesive backing that feels solid and secure when attached. So far, it hasn't fallen yet! (if it does, I know it will be in the middle of the night!!!! lol) I love that they included some extra stickies for the back!",

                "reviewText": "For years I have been using my husbands razors. Sharing a membership to one of those manly man clubs. Because for some reason they always had the right amount of soap (that didn't make me rashy or dry!) and blades that made me happy. But they always have that heavy metal handle. You know, so you don't forget you're a man. Haha But anyway, I am very happy to have tried this brand and will be switching! The soap is gentle, not overbearing and just enough you can trust shaving with a quickness without worrying about razor burn or cuts. It is very light weight, easy to change the disposable head and I like that it is magnet that keeps it hanging up on the piece that sticks to the wall. Which I was also skeptical about keeping hung up because it is just a tiny dot of adhesive but so far has stayed put perfectly (for about a month now) and no issues peeling or falling off the wall. Delicate color for femininity but without the pink tax. Highly recommend. One more thing, one head has lasted me a good amount of time without having to change it!",
