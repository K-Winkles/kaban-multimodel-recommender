But I want the ones WITHOUT the lubricating strip (slimy and interferes with cutting whiskers), and WITHOUT a pivoting head (which often changes angle and I cut myself).Got tired of not finding them, and I will not purchase the overpriced name-brand offerings. So I thought I'd give these a try. They work identically (sharpness, blade life) to the aforementioned generic ones that never seem to be in stock, and they are half the price of the ones on the shelves.Very pleased.",

                "reviewText": "Just got the 100 pack from UPS today. I decided to try one of these bad boys out real quick just now and see how it would work. Yeap! IT MADE ME BLEED. Beautiful razors. Better than I expected. I used one razor after freshening up my face with my Babyliss Pro double foil, then attacked the rest of the stubble with the blade. Yes, I was expecting to bleed. I like my shaves close, when I do shave. I can easily go for 2 or 3 days after a good close shave before having to shave again. This gave me exactly that. Lack of pivoting head? Whatever, manipulate the blade head with your hand. Bleeding? Duh, I keep mentioning that. Just learn to shave your face more gently and you'll be fine. Since you can shave so close, you'll be able to look fresh if you shave the night before or before a shower. Between a good double foil razor and these blades, I was able to shave in less than 5 minutes and it looks as good as if I had gone to the barber and paid a premium. Very happy. And better still, the blade is still sharp and clean so I'll get another use out of it. Oh yeah, there's 100 of them, for $19 with free shipping. Can't really go wrong here, I'll be back for more.",
