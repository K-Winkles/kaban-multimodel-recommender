The material is cheap, like flimsy cheap, it could have been a prize for tickets at a kids pizza party restaurant with a rat mascot cheap. I can't believe this was over $50.I have another razor that takes cheaper blades that was much cheaper. But the replacement blades for that model absolutely suck and catch your skin. Again, the Feather blades are the only reason I kept this thing, so disappointed.",
