                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this razor; however, it does not contain 6 blades as the title suggests. The razor is actually a 5 blade razor with 3 spare razor heads and one preattached. I personally use only 6 blade razors because I feel they give the closest shave; however this razor does just as good as my 6 blade.I have tried so many razors and concluded that 6 blade was the only one I would buy from now on, but surprisingly, I will be replacing my 6 blade with this 5 blade razor. The razor handle is very comfortable and has an excellent grip on it. I love the pink color of the handle as well. The head of the razor pivots and glides so smoothly up and down your legs. I love that the additional 3 razor heads come sealed in their own bags to keep them sanitary until use. It is very easy to pop the razor head off to install a new one when needed.While shaving my legs, I noticed that the razor was not slipping at all while in the shower. I could glide over my skin with ease leaving my legs, underarms, and bikini areas incredibly smooth. I was left with zero razor burn, no cuts, just silky smooth legs. I am highly impressed with this razor.While I originally picked up this razor because it said it was a 6 blade, I am beyond impressed with the close and even shave I got from this razor. I have indeed found my new favorite razor. I 100 percent recommend this razor; it is one of the closest shaves I have ever gotten.",

The blades are easy to pop in and out when replacing them.I would purchase these again - they seem to be decent quality and I like the number of blades each \"head\" has.",
