                "reviewText": "This razor is absolutely phenomenal. The quality is top class for the price. I have always used a manual razor and this was my first electric razor. I\u2019d say, that the time it saves myself in the morning to shave with this razor has been dramatic. There is no need for shaving cream, and you don\u2019t really have to worry about cutting yourself. The razor itself has a couple of attachments that have been nice. It has a skin guard which makes it even more difficult to cut yourself and I\u2019ve predominantly used that guard when shaving my body. I will say, I was able to shave my whole body in under a half hour using this razor, which includes shaving legs, arms, and everything else except for the hair on my head. It has a pretty ergonomic grip, so it doesn\u2019t feel awkward, and the silicone on the handle allows for a decent grip even when wet. The battery life of this razor is also spectacular, I\u2019ve used the razor for over a month daily and only have had to charge it once, which was when I took it out of the box for the first time. This razor has allowed me to enjoy shaving instead of dreading it. I would recommend this razor to anyone that didn\u2019t already have one.",

                "reviewText": "So let's get into the OneBlade. Overall - a very good device. Some things to consider however.FACE------For shaving it'll cut down even the tallest beards. You see stuff in the ads and it performs just as well. Just remember that there are various hair and skin types. Some persons may be able to get a clean shave easily, but others may have problems getting it clean. Personally - I tried to get it clean after a clean shave about a week prior, but it didn't do as good a job as I'd think. Interestingly, my wife took the OneBlade and and went over the same spots that I had - and got a clean shave done. You may need someone else to assist with getting it clean, depending on your hair type and skin type.BODY-------I didn't do full body, but chest and arms (including pits) were clean quite easily. Again, body type and hair type may require more passes.TENDERS-----------The guard for \"sensitive areas\" makes shaving those parts easy. You won't get as clean a shave with the guard, but it'll get the hairs low enough for other tools to be used.CLEANING-------------It's pretty easy to clean. If you simply run the device while it's in water, or use air (canned or otherwise) you can get it clean quickly. It's best not to brush/rub/touch the blade as that may reduce the life.BATTERY-----------Thus far, I've only charged it once per month. It keeps the charge quite well. Usage is 1-2 times per week and still manages to keep the charge.OVERALL-----------Depending on your body type and hair type, the OneBlade will either give you a clean shave or get it low enough to use another product for the clean shave. If you have someone else to help, it may be possible to get a clean shave.SUMMARY------------With that said - it's a great device. Some persons may need to use another device (razor maybe?) to get a clean shave - but the OneBlade will at least get it low enough to make it much easier for another device (like a razor). Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "This razor has given me the closest, cleanest shave I've ever gotten from an electric razor. It leaves behind no burn, doesn't get away from you, and charges quick.The blades do great work, but the plastic bit that attaches to the main unit is incredibly fragile. I dropped it onto my carpeted floor from 1/2 a meter up and it was rendered unusable.Thankfully, the kit comes with two blades, but with replacements starting at $15, a cushioned drop shouldn't be a deal-breaker.TL;DR don't drop your razor heads and it's the best razor on the market.",

I have been relatively careless with it when i use it and im out unscathed. you might have to go over the area a fee times to get everything but it works great. They give you what are equivalent of guards to set a length and they attach easily. Battery life lasts very long.",
