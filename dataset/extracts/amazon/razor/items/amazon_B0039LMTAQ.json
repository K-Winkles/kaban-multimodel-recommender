Instead of having to worry about the soapy water with a slippery grip, these razors eliminate that fear. The razor head is sharp but safe and has a safety cover for when storing. Since I have traveled a lot this year, I have realized how helpful that aspect is. I can throw the razor in a bag of other things and it doesn\u2019t scrape or scratch anything else because of the safety cover. Overall, I highly recommend this razor!!",

Would recommend using a shaving cream or lotion (if ur dry shaving which I dont recommend doing but if its an emergency lol).",
