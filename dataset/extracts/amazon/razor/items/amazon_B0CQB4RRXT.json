                "reviewText": "Great razor with 5 blades on the head, with the soothing gel packs to add some moisture to your skin. This is a great set to get started on and see if you like using this razor, it comes with the handle and three replacement cartridges. What I found most unique about this razor is the gel section can be flipped backwards to have a more precise shave, great for doing your sideburns. I have seen them have a blade on the back of the head before, but I really like this solution. t gives a great close shave and leaves your skin feeling smooth, well my skin is smooth anyway, I look like I'm in my 20's when I'm almost 50. So my facial hair still grows in fine so the razors will last me awhile. I do like the hydro strips in the top of this, it would be great if they actually sold replacement strips, because the razor will last me awhile, the strips only last me a few shaves and they are done. But overall this is a great razor set and really like this, Will be buying more blades for this handle when I finally use the last of the blades it came with.",

                "reviewText": "I normally shave with an electric razor, but I use a manual razor to get a closer shave in some areas where the electric doesn't do a good enough job, such as on my neck. I have used Harry's razors for years. I love them because their blades are very sharp and they last a long time before I need to replace them. I hadn't used Schick razors in a long time, so I thought I would give this new model a try. I was surprised, but it's really nice. The 5 blades cut about as well as my Harry's blades do. The handle is also very ergonomic. I think this value pack is a good deal since you get 3 cartridges with it. I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone who wants to get a close shave with a manual razor.",

My skin gets pretty dry sometimes while shaving, and I don't think I noticed it as much using this razor, although it's hard to tell because my skin is dryer on different days.The razor felt good to use, it has a nice weight to it, and I haven't had any issues with it snagging skin or anything. This definitely feels like a value pack, I think it's well worth it for the handle and the 3 blade attachments.",

The Hydro 5 does an excellent job, but compared to the cheaper 4 blade Quattro cartridges, I don't really notice much difference with shaving performance for the 5 blade Hydro 5 cartridge. I do like Hydro 5's flip back precision edger so I can get to the hard-to-reach areas under my nose. With the Quattro the lubrication strip makes this difficult, so that's a nice feature the Hydro 5 has going for it. Still, the price difference is significant. Searching on Amazon, I can get 6 Quattro refill cartridges for about the same price as 4 Hydro 5 refill cartridges. I don't find there's enough of an improvement to make the switch to the more expensive Hydro 5.",

The shave is very smooth -- almost to the point where I had to double check that it was actually shaving!
