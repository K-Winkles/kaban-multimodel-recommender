                "reviewText": "Wow! This is what a thriller is meant to be. Lisa Jewell has created a deliciously disturbing and intriguing story that will keep the reader enthralled to the end. I know I was!Alix Summers and Josie Fair meet on the night of their shared 45th birthday. Josie proclaims them \u201cbirthday twins\u201d and approaches Alix, a well-known podcaster, with the idea of making a podcast about Josie\u2019s life and her plans to change her future. Alix is intrigued by Josie\u2019s unconventional relationship with her much older husband. They agree to do the podcast, and Josie spills all the astonishing and disturbing details of her life. But Alix does not realize that Josie is becoming obsessed with her, and she does not notice the impact that Josie is having on her life and family until it may be too late.Everything about this story works. The characters are interesting and well-developed. No one is truly likable, but some are more dysfunctional than others. Josie Fair appears to be meek and simple, but there are disturbing depths to her character that make for an unpredictable, thrilling narrative. Alix is so enthralled by Josie's story and how she can benefit from it that she does not notice as Josie insinuates herself into Alix's life. The action is paced perfectly. The narrative alternates between Josie and Alix's interactions in real time and excerpts from the podcast and the documentary. The documentary sections add just the right amount of suspense by hinting at events that the reader has not yet witnessed. Though the plot is somewhat predictable, the execution is so good that it does not detract from the success of the book.Honestly, I just love a dark, twisted, messed up thriller, and that is what you get with this book. I highly recommend it to readers who enjoy this as well.",

                "reviewText": "Oh my god. This was my first Mystery/ Thriller book I have ever read and it did not disappoint.While it was written in the third person Lisa Jewell gives the reader an amazing insight into the thoughts and motives behind the characters. When you first meet both Alix and Josie you know there is more to them that meets the eye. While yes, Alix's life isn't picture perfect and she has a husband that will go out on benders she is not the perfect instagram podcaster that the internet see's. Josie on the other hand has a dark past and mental health problems that makes everyone wonder is what she is saying true at the end. Josie seems to be living in a web of lies that she brings Alix into as they begin their podcast leading to many dark twists and turns. The addition of the Netflix Series snippets woven throughout the story help to build anticipation as you are also finding out what is going on with Alix and Josie. It leads me to think that maybe this would turn into an amazing Movie/ TV series. The ending is a bit unsatisfying as it does leave the door open to potentially continue Josie's story. At the end of the book Lisa Jewell has the readers questioning who was actually telling the truth and as the title suggests None of this is True.",

So are we now not excited for Erin to be moving in with her? Do we need to get a pov chapter from Roxy, our new additional villain? Just was random and weird. She says in the writers note at the end that she wrote this one quickly, and I think the end is where you can really tell that.",

I feel the ending left you still questioning much of the truth. But that\u2019s maybe what is best for the reader.",
