I do have to say, I definitely could relate to certain parts of the story as I became a girl into a woman and the awkwardness that came with it, the unsureness of it all. I would have to say, this has been probably the best book I have read by her so far. I have read a couple of others, but like I said, I could relate to some things that happened in this story as I was growing up.",

                "reviewText": "The Quarry Girls: A Thriller is a first read by Jess Lourey that I selected as part of a challenge! While I consider myself an eclectic reader, I sadly admit that a book based on a true crime, full of murder and mayhem would not be my usual choice of reading material. If I wanted to be full of anxiety, fear and anger, I could read US NEWS and World Reports. If not for the Kindle challenge to read a book based on true crime I would have missed experiencing the brilliant talent of Jess Lourey. I was totally unprepared for the tsunami of emotions I would feel reading Quarry Girls.In her author notes (pg. 310), Jess Lourey thanks five authors whose words inspire her writing. Jess writes, \" [they] can put together a sentence so unexpected and delicious that I go back to taste it again and again.\" Jess Lourey's writing inspired the same feelings in me. I usually read to escape but with Jess Lourey's Quarry Girls I found myself savoring her words. It was an experience similar to lingering over a magnificent five course meal, allowing the different flavors of the food, the wine and the companionship, to roll over your tongue and incite your mind. A book that excites and involves all 5 of my senses is a new experience for me.As much as I was exhilarated by the suspense of the story, I was facinated by Ms. Lourey's word craft. Quarry Girls is the most highlighted work of fiction I have on my shelves. Jess Lourey through mere words invoked a feeling of childhood nostalgia, taking me back to a time in the 70s I remember to be idellyic and simpler than today. And while I reveled in memories of swimming in the canals around my small Central California town, Jess Lourey's creative words reminded me that I never knew what secrets, plots and political manipulations were occurring at my parents cocktail parties. I thought she might have read my diary but again the opening pages of the book clued me into the fact that miles from California, Jess Lourey shared a similar childhood. The way I instantly related to her characters added to the thrill and chills felt as the story unfolds! Of the 70s for example, Jess character Heather says, \" That summer, the summer of 77,everything had edges. The sharpness took my fiends, but it cut away the blinders, too. And once you understand the truth, there's no living any other way.\" Talk about \"killing me softly with words\"! Jess Lourey took my memories, my adventures, my bad choices and wove them into poetic work of art. If only I had the talent to paint a picture with words the way, Jess does in this novel.I was mesmerized by this book. I read page after page of this novel, ignoring my messy house and myhis dogs whines for attention, and finished this book in a day. I was so enthralled, determine to figure out whodunit and how things would turn out, I didn't realize that night had fallen! And then I was so upset that I had finished already, I almost started over again; this time determined to take my time and savor every word. Instead I purchased the audio version so I could sit back close my eyes and have the words wash over me as I rock in my favorite chair in front of the fireplace this winter.Thanks so much to the Kindle Challenge for forcing me to choose a book out of my usual readings which led me to Jess Lourey. She will now occupy a place on my \"fave author's shelf.",

As this book went on I began to totally figure out who the bad guys were. The ending left me very dissatisfied the father and the town leaders were not really addressed as to their character and not much said about their discipline if much at all imo.",

                "reviewText": "Series Info/Source: This is a stand alone book. I got a copy of this on ebook through Amazon First Reads.Thoughts: This was an interesting read. I am not generally a huge fan of serial killer/thriller types of books. I was intrigued by the Minnesota setting here and I really did end up enjoying that Minnesota setting. There is a lot of background here on the late 1970's in the St. Cloud area, particularly Pantown. I had no idea that so many awful things were happening in that time frame in St. Cloud. I also didn't know the urban myths around the Pantown tunnels.The story follows Heather as she and her two girlfriends get an amazing opportunity for their all girl band to perform at the county fair. This is overshadowed some by the fact that a girl named Beth has recently gone missing. Their first performance at the fair goes awesome and they are pumped for their next until one of their band members, Maureen, goes missing. Heather is smart and she is sure that Beth isn't a runaway and neither is Maureen, so Heather starts digging. What she finds reveals a nasty underside to their idealistic small town.This was a well done story. I enjoyed Heather as a character, although her home life was seriously messed up and got more so as the story continued. It was an interesting look back in time and really drove home how in a lot of ways a \"woman's\" place in society has improved. However, it also drove home how far we still have to go. It was scary how easily society accepted the disappearance of these girls and how readily trusted figures in society accepted and even participated in what was happening.This was easy to read and hard to put down. It is definitely a page-turner and the story kept me guessing. The conclusion wasn't as surprising as I had hoped, but I did enjoy how the story wrapped up. It ends on a hopeful note and I really admired how Heather and Beth handled everything.My Summary (4/5): Overall I enjoyed learning about the history of the St. Cloud area and enjoyed the mystery behind this story. This was well written, easy to read, and not too scary. Will I pick up more Lourey books in the future? Well, as I said, I am not a huge fan of this genre but if another Lourey book comes up in a Minnesota setting and it sounds intriguing I would definitely consider it. This was an interesting read and very well written.",

                "reviewText": "I was rather torn when it came to reviewing The Quarry Girls by Jess Lourey. It was quite a good story but the way it's written and some aspects of the story,the very unique layout of the streets and houses in the fictional Minnesota with it's house linked by underground passages that the residents scurry around in and much else smacks of Young Adult fiction. In a whole book with a cast of teenagers one character says \"effing\" ,and I mean literally \"effing\" and not the actual \"F word\". While I'm not a fan of excessive bad language in books we're talking about drug taking teens here who are involved in all kinds of nastiness.Admittedly the story is related by a young teenager but I was reading it thinking,despite it's often difficult and disturbing scenes that I was reading something written for people of the same age group as most of the characters. No problem there if the publishers had marketed it as Young Adult fiction as it addresses a number of important issues and situations that young girls unfortunately have to deal with very well.The story is based on real events from Jess Loury's home town as she says in her introduction. A group of teenagers are negotiating the tricky transformation between child and adult with misfit Heather feeling left out as her ,relatively,more mature best friends Maureen and Brenda tackle the minefield of being girls in a woman's body and dipping a toe into the adult drugs,alcohol and male attention.With reports of a girl having being abducted Heather and Benda stumble across something awful ,closely followed by another one disappearing. Thinking there's a link Heather investigates and discovers a different side to the town and people she's known all of her life.I'd strongly suggest that the publishers market this as a YA book. There are many difficult issues addressed in the story addressed in a way that is not explicit , exploitative or patronising. It shows the pressures on young people,girls in particular ,not least from predatory adults.While I appreciate that the narrator is a teenager I wasn't massively convinced by much of it as an adult reader,and I've read plenty of very good books written with \"a young voice\"I'd actually consider this a great book for the 16+ age group, plenty of \"bad stuff\" happens but young people of that age group will be aware of most of the subject matter from tv and movies and it's written in a way that won't give them nightmares. As a YA book I'd actually give it 5 stars.As an adult reader that would be 3 stars,it very nearly lost me right at the beginning with the description of the town and its origins.Split down the middle that's 4 stars",
