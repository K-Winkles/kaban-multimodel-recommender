This cozy series set in the 1950s features Flora, a bookstore owner in the sleepy village of Abbeymead and Jack, a writer of crime fiction. Jack settled in Abbeymead after WW II in search of a quiet life but since becoming involved with Flora they have been involved in multiple investigations. In this novel our two sleuths are off to France to help Jack's mother who thinks someone is out to kill her. We also learn more about the ties to France in Flors's past. This is a strong cozy mystery series. Well plotted and paced. I feel this can be read as a stand alone but recommend the sentinel series.",

                "reviewText": "If you\u2019ve read previous books in Merryn Allingham\u2019s Flora Steele series, you know there\u2019s no love lost between Jack Carrington and his parents. So when his mother calls from France beseeching him to come to Paris, he\u2019s taken aback. He hasn\u2019t spoken to Sybil in seven years. Why is she calling now? Because an acquaintance was struck and killed by a car, and she thinks the car was actually aiming for her.Flora also has unfinished business in France. According to her former boyfriend, she will find her parents\u2019 graves there. So she and Jack travel together to meet Sybil in Paris. Paris is quite the experience for Flora! Soon they travel to the village of Vaison, where Sybil is living with Italian count Massimo Falconi and his family. It doesn\u2019t take long for Jack and Flora to pick up on the not-s0-subtle undercurrent of hostility in the villa. Does Massimo plan to marry Sybil? (Sybil certainly hopes so!) Who might resent that enough to try to kill her? One of his two daughters? His ex-wife? One of the maids at the villa? A local mechanic?Merryn Allingham spends a fair bit of time focusing on the scenery in Paris and Provence. We get to see it through Flora\u2019s eyes, and her sense of wonder at her surroundings is a lot of fun. I\u2019ve never been to Paris or Provence, so I enjoyed living vicariously through Flora!But the mystery isn\u2019t left hanging for the sake of the environment. I can certainly see why Richard Frant is Flora\u2019s FORMER boyfriend. He irritated me from his first appearance in the book. I was hoping he hadn\u2019t led Flora on a wild-goose chase in some misguided attempt to win her back.And Sybil. What a piece of work she is! But I did feel for her, because she was surrounded by people who (with the exception of Massimo) really did not like her. No matter how unpleasant she might be as a person and how lackluster her parenting skills might have been, she was in a situation that I wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone.We get to see Flora and Jack draw closer here. The trip is good for Flora in more ways than one, and she loses some of her hesitancy in letting herself admit how she feels about Jack. That makes me happy. They\u2019re wonderful together, and I hope there\u2019s a wedding for them in some future book!An intriguing mystery in a beautiful setting, suspects and red herrings aplenty, and a satisfying touch of romance. Merryn Allingham has another winner with Murder in a French Village!",

Flora tags along to try and finally find out the truth about her parents\u2019 death. Set between Paris and Provence, it is very atmospheric, bringing a city I know well to life and giving me definite yearnings to visit Provence! A lot of suspects - most of them connected by blood, marriage and employment to the man Jack\u2019s mother is involved with - even by the end I had difficulty understanding who had been involved - and eliminating them is difficult for our heroes, neither of whom are in any sort of official capacity. But a very enjoyable read!",
