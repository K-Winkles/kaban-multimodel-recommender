            "Editorial Reviews Review \"Mike Curtis' clear, fast-paced writing style worked great for this book. I'm looking forward to reading more by him in the future.\" \u00ad-Kristina Hall, Author, Promises Unbroken\"The latter half of the story was tense and fast paced... it is an enjoyable adventure story with a fun backstory and mystery to solve.\" -Sara Beth Williams, Author, A Worthy Heart\"Mike Curtis' The Key House is aimed at younger readers; however, I found myself smiling and rapidly turning the pages as I relived the joy serial mysteries like The Hardy Boys gave me as a kid. It is a clever story, with realistic family scenarios deftly blended with high adventure, complete with tales of pirates' gold and riddles left by a distant ancestor. Curtis skillfully weaves the underlying Christian message into the story as a natural part of who the characters are, consistent with their overall portrayal. The story's pace builds nicely, with the tension steadily rising until the satisfying end brings readers down from an exciting climax. \" -Tilmer Wright Jr., Readers' Favorite, 5 stars review\"Very well written with obvious thought as the story unfolds... This story captures the reader right away in Chapter 1... This is an excellent read. I will be looking for the next book in the series.\" -Leanne B., Certified Secondary Teacher of 25+ years\"Such a fun adventure story for middle-grade kids!... The hidden passageways, the twists and turns... I really enjoyed this book and can't wait for the next one to come out!\" -Jennifer Spaudo, former Online Editor, Charisma Magazine\"The author has done a wonderful job of instilling suspense and family-friendly lessons in a story intended for younger readers. Even as grandparents, we found the book to be intriguing and engaging and really appreciated the inspiring faith-filled moments in the lives of the Noland kids... This is a well-written book and we look forward to subsequent books in the series!\" -Chris Gardner, Pastor\"I am far too passionate about finding good reading material for myself and my children to recommend any book that we didn't delight in. And I did love this book! It is short enough to be read aloud with my kids, with an engaging storyline that kept me reading into the night. The two brothers who are the heroes are realistic in their squabbles, interests, and humor. The family life portrayed is warm, showing parents who care and support their children as they grow up and explore. I suspect every child dreams of secret rooms, hidden treasure, mysterious and unexpected family history, and exploring on their own. This plot offers it all!\" -Katherine Nolette, former University English Professor\"Your kids will not get bored with this book, I guarantee it. The humor, the lessons, the clear presentation of the Gospel in a relevant way flowed so well in this fun story. Mike writes clearly and keeps the reader on the edge at the end of each chapter waiting to see what happens next. I was excited to read this book and it made me feel like a kid again; I know your kids will love it!\" -Manny Alamo, Lead Pastor\"This book is amazing! It has all the elements I've always wanted to happen in my life...a hidden treasure, adventure, mystery, and a beautiful testimony of how Jesus can change a life. The story has me turning pages wanting to find out what happens next. These characters feel like friends now and I can't wait for their next adventure.\" -Meredith C., Author, Reviewer, Homeschool Conference Speaker\"If I was giving this book a stars rating, I would go over and above the 5 stars. It truly is that good!\" -Pam Collins, Author, The Gift of Simple blogsite, mother and grandmother\"This story captured my attention immediately and was full of fun twists and turns.\" -Edith, 18\"At times, I was at the edge of my seat to see what would happen next!\" -Noah, 13\"It was an excellent book, and I can't wait for the next book.\" -Jenna, 12 From the Author As a boy I was driven by a love for adventure and mystery.I clicked on the flashlight and peered deep into the crevice. Scrutinizing. Surveying. Its twists quickly lost my light. But curiosity led me on as I squeezed between the giant boulders and into a winding cave in search of... what else? Treasure. And not just any treasure... pirate's treasure!At just seven years of age I was flanked by my three brothers, two older, one younger. We were determined to discover the find of the century. Or at least, that's how I remember it (little boys' imaginations do tend toward wild dreams). And this is my story!So, as I was saying... us four boys loved to explore the remains of what looked like an avalanche of huge rocks down the long, steep bank of the Brandywine River. Or perhaps it was the remains of some ancient giant emptying his pockets of stones he had collected that day. As they say, \"I've heard it both ways.\"However they actually got there, they piled on top of each other to form deep, intricate caves. And well aware that pirates always hid their treasure in caves (this was a well-known principle I'm sure I learned from some authoritative source, like my best friend next door who avidly read the newspaper and Readers' Digest), we were determined to soon become wealthy in our discovery.Though such was never our fortune, from my early childhood days I have always loved adventure and mystery. This tale, The Key House, though quite different in some ways from my creative quests as a little boy, plays the same themes of adventure and mystery. And they will tug at any heart in search of these.But stories are also meant to touch the heart.As a young pastor I had learned that if your message, or story, does not touch you deeply, it will not touch those listening. The same is true for the written word. Let it move you, and it will move others.Personal confession here: towards the end of The Key House, I still cry when reading portions. Granted, I am moved by stories of the hurting and their desperate cry of pain. Maybe in part that's why God called me to pastor.So, I invite you to be touched by this story, not simply in its adventure and mystery, but in its drama of two brothers' relationship in turmoil, the deep, bitter heartache of the antagonist, and the beautiful story of redemption and what happens when God is invited into our pain. Perhaps in some way, this is your story. I know in some ways, it is mine."

I appreciated that it incorporated Christian values. The story had some intense parts, but nothing too scary. I would highly recommend this book for kids and teens. I\u2019m really looking forward to reading the next book in this series.",
