                "reviewText": "THE CHRISTIE AFFAIRBY: NINA DE GRAMONTAbout a 4.5 stars.This was a book that I was so excited to read because I love books about famous Author's. This wasn't in the book but, I am adding it because it was a fact that I didn't know until recently; It is that Agatha Christie has sold more books than any other Author. Back to this book. Agatha Christie and Archie Christie both share the same initials and called each other A.C. It is based on the eleven day disappearance of Agatha Christie in December of 1926. Agatha is just in the midst of grieving her mother's death when her husband Archie tells her he wants a divorce.When I first started this I thought that this was going to be a Five star read. It drew me in right away and the writing is engaging. What was disappointing was that most of the book is about Archie's mistress the fictional one called Nan O'Dea. I understood why the author chose to do what she did by the end of the book. I have to be honest though, I was hoping it was going to be more about the Christie's and less about his mistress's back story. It was disappointing because I didn't really seem interested in the mistress's back story. I did give this 4.5 stars, but it was more like a four star reading experience for most of it--but it is worthy of 4.5 after finishing it. It is entertaining when Agatha is involved in the various scenes and that was in the very beginning and towards the last section. In all fairness to Nina de Gramont I can't blame her for choosing to have more Nan than Agatha. It is an excellent book and I am so grateful to have read it. It is my fault for expecting something and assuming it was more Agatha oriented. Any way maybe I can say that Agatha did turn out to be more successful based on her book sales being as being the most sold. Maybe I have issues with cheating or a woman stealing someone else's husband. But most likely if there is a mistress it isn't just her fault. The husband should be held more accountable for lying and sneaking because we all know that they all have the same story to excuse what they do if they do it. So it definitely wasn't all Nan's fault why I was less engaged. I just didn't find her life as interesting. But it was overall a great reading experience when I reflect on all of the book as a whole rather than what I was hoping it would be. I usually enjoy a book the less I know about it. So I take full responsibility for my rating.I might have liked it more if the mistress's back story was more interesting, but for me it just wasn't. I realize that this is historical fiction, but I like to learn things when I read it. Agatha seemed like such a nice person and it is so unfortunate that she had that done to her and I mean a husband whom you love cheat on you while you are living together thinking you are in a happy marriage. In this narrative Agatha is only thirty-six and I suppose if the husband you love is going to cheat it is better to be young and still beautiful. In this story she is ten years older than Nan.This isn't spoiler territory to reveal that Nan was present when Agatha announces to Archie with Nan in the room and she tells him to that there is a lunch planned with her new literary agent. Archie tells Agatha that he can't attend because he has a mountain of work to do. Agatha being the good person that she is and also polite invites Nan to go. Agatha says that they will make it a girls' luncheon. And off they go.This was a very clever endeavor and if it wasn't I wouldn't have been so excited to read it. The last part of the book made me understand why it was formatted and plotted the way it was. I did enjoy it very much and recommend it to mystery lovers. There is a murder and Agatha isn't as well known during this time frame. It seemed that everybody was searching for her all over England. It was well written and I would be interested in reading whatever this Author chooses to write about next.",

The further I read, the sadder I grew with this narrative of her first marriage and her life circumstances - and almost didn't finish. Not having read any reviews, I didn't understand until the end the true premise of this book, and it was definitely a happy, surprising revelation. It made me want to go back and re-read some of Christie's works, knowing who some of her famous characters might have been based on. If you are a Christie fan, this will not disappoint.",

                "reviewText": "This incredibly fun historical fiction earned <b>4 Stars</b> from me.<b>SUMMARY</b>In real life, Agatha Christie disappeared for eleven days in 1926. Although she was found at a spa hotel, having checked in under her husbands mistresses name, no one could ever fully explain what happened.At the time, she was just beginning to become known as a mystery novelist but her personal life was a mess. Her beloved mother had passed away just a few months prior and her husband was leaving her for another woman.Word of her disappearance made international news, even appearing on the front page of the New York Times. Thousand of people showed up to a search for her. Then, as mysteriously as she disappeared, she resurfaced eleven days later, at the spa seemingly confused about all the fuss.The official cause given by her family was a case of amnesia. Possibly brought on by a car accident or maybe stress related to the loss of her mother.After being found, Agatha retreated to her sisters estate and recovered from her <i>amnesia</i>. Neither she nor her family ever spoke publicly spoke of it again.Shortly after the incident, she and her husband were divorced and before the ink was even dry on the divorce papers, her husband married his mistress.This book explores how author, Marie Benedict, thinks could have happened. She takes facts from a variety of sources, Including Agatha's autobiography, her imagination to recreate the incident.<b>WHAT I LOVED</b>We will never know what really happened during those eleven days, but, OMG(!), I hope this story is what happened!!! It is the PERFECT, most satisfying scenario!I was fascinated by the amount of time women back in the way spent worrying about making sure their husbands were happy and felt like the center of the universe. So funny. While I do not actively try to thwart my husband's happiness, I certainly do not spend my days trying to make create a perfect, happy world for him.I love reading about rich people stuff from <i>back in the day</i>. Agatha's father died and the Miller (Agatha's maiden name) family fortune had dwindled, leaving Agatha, her siblings and their mother, what they considered to be, financially strapped. Of course, to them that means they still have the family estate, she completed her education in France, she spends her time flitting around between house parties and her (literal) dance card is always full, but she did have to have her debutant season in Egypt because London was too expensive. Poor, poor girl!! Just so interesting to be a fly on the wall for all that.<b>WHAT I DIDN'T LOVE</b>Sometimes historical fiction annoys me a little because I will never know how much is real and how much is made up.<b>OVERALL</b>Such a FUN BOOK! If you are looking for a fun distraction, its for you!",

Ambos os tempos se desenvolvem at\u00e9 encontrarem um ponto em comum na parte 2, no momento que a encontram.Vemos dois tipos de narra\u00e7\u00e3o, uma, em primeira pessoa, narrada por Christie, e outra, em terceira, mostrando o que se passava na investiga\u00e7\u00e3o, principalmente envolvendo a figura de Archie Christie.Uma obra extremamente informativa mas que entret\u00e9m tamb\u00e9m, vemos todo o rebuli\u00e7o causado pelo desaparecimento da autora, que foi investigado por dois chefes de pol\u00edcia, contou com buscas pela Inglaterra e envolveu at\u00e9 a ajuda do autor de Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, para encontr\u00e1-la.Vemos tamb\u00e9m um pouco da sua situa\u00e7\u00e3o matrimonial e momentos pivotais na vida da autora como seu casamento, suas primeiras publica\u00e7\u00f5es, quando ela se junta ao corpo de enfermeiras durante a guerra, o nascimento de sua filha e a morte de sua m\u00e3e.Incrivelmente bem escrita, The Mystery of Mrs. Christie, \u00e9 uma obra que completa com fic\u00e7\u00e3o as lacunas presentes na vida real e traz um desfecho interessante, plaus\u00edvel e incr\u00edvel para a hist\u00f3ria!",

Now she deals with the most famous author of classic murder mysteries : Agatha Christie, whose personal life proves to have been a mystery in itself. Benedict always relies on a basis of methodical research and then adds to that her own intuition and writing talent to present us with an extremely engaging result: a book hard to put down. This latest novel is written according to the plot design used successfully by Agatha Christie herself, and in this case the cleverly devised plot with its surprising twists and turns makes us doubt and wonder to the very last page. It is a stylistic triumph and a very good read!",
