                "reviewText": "There is a looming sense of fear and dread throughout the entire novel, definitely a could-not-put-it down listen. I loved the narration, perfect for this gripping novel.The plot is outstanding, typical of Lisa Jewell. Suspenseful and unique, not at all predictable.I\u2019ve listened to over a hundred books since I retired 5 years ago and this is my 6th Lisa Jewell novel. Lisa Jewell is the only author I tolerate some profanity, as she uses it not for shock value, but for characterization. It is clearly used to make the reader dislike (even loath) some characters, to give particular characters\u2019 uniqueness and personality. I also tolerate some of the sexual (not detailed) indiscretions in her books, and in this one a same sex relationship. All that said, there are some authors that can do all that without profanity or sex.The characters are so vivid and emotionally well-drawn. I cared what happened to them in spite of their flaws and poor life choices.I took off a star because there was just something \u201coff\u201d about the ending. Like it was so rushed that it needed to be explained in and epilogue? The Night She Disappeared has such a great storyline, such well-drawn layered characters, I\u2019m not sure why the epilogue could not have been integrated into the character\u2019s actions and events.",

The author weaves a decent story, but I'm really getting tired of every. single. book. doing the back and forth between times thing. And then the ending was a major let down, it could've been so much better! Page 247 actually made me mad, and I almost stopped reading because how stupid is this character to not realize this?! But I never don't finish a book, except for Infinite Jest \ud83d\ude02 so I kept going. If you're a fast reader and burn though a few books a week, sure, waste your time, but if you're looking for a really interesting mystery this is not it.",

                "reviewText": "I adore Lisa Jewell's writing style - hugely atmospheric and visual but without being verbose - and I loved the plot of this twisty novel equally. The characters were spot on; flawed but sympathetic, particularly Kim and Tallulah - and there are other players that I loved to hate and found suspicious from the outset. Sophie is an enigma; a bored and lonely headmaster's partner, crime writer and amateur sleuth. I found her mildly irritating at times, but it soon became clear that she's vital to the plot. Oh, and the ending! It was everything I wanted. Thank you, LJ, for another riveting read.",
