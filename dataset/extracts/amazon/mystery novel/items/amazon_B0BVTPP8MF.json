The writing was excellent- clear yet descriptive. The story follows 2 women - one living in the 70s the other living post -Covid. I highly recommend this book it has a mystery, adventure and wisdom.",

I liked this story and getting to know Eddie and Rowan throughout. I never knew what was going to happen from one moment to the next and there were a lot of surprises in store as a result. I also loved the Adirondacks setting and how serene everything felt in nature.There was an element of suspense in wanting to find out how Eddie went missing, but I felt like it was anticlimactic when we learned what happened. The situation was tragic, but I was expecting something more from it.Overall, an interesting novel and a worthwhile read. Well done, Karma!",

It sparked so many memories of my own when growing up - wandering alone and happy in a forest near my home (which is now part of the D.C. Beltway), being taught to speak my mind, my own developing independence, the buzzsaw against the women's movement of the '70s, how today's sexist dinosaurs are still fighting us. I graduated college in 1975 and this book's story is set there. I read Betty Friedan's seminal call to action when it first came out. This book has been a wake up call for me now, at age 70. I am going to buy this book in hard copy and keep it. Thank you, Karma Brown.",
