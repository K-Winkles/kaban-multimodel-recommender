                "reviewText": "DCI Harry Grimm tends to drive his superintendent with the Bristol police a bit crazy. He knows his stuff, her gets results, but a lot of people seemed to get beaten up in the process. It doesn\u2019t help that he\u2019s still looking for his father; 20 years before, the man violently abused Grimm\u2019s younger brother and killed his mother. He was never caught.Grimm carries his military service in the parachute crops with him, courtesy of an unexpected explosive device that left his face permanently scarred. So scarred, in fact, that his appearance scares suspects, villains, and witnesses alike.After an almost-bungled sting (Grimm came very close to it being his last operation), his superintendent packs him off to a small town in the Yorkshire Dales. Officially, he\u2019s being loaned (or seconded) to the police force there. It\u2019s Herriott country, he tells himself, and he knows he\u2019ll soon be bored to tears. Except he\u2019s hardly there any time at all when a local teenager disappears. Runaways aren\u2019t that uncommon, of course, but this followed a major scene at church when the girl supposedly received a text from her boyfriend.It may be Herriott country, and you may have to navigate the sheep herds in the lanes, but crime doesn\u2019t take a holiday in the Dales. A murder follows the girl\u2019s disappearance, and now it\u2019s all hands on deck before it gets worse.\u201cGrimm Up North\u201d is the first of 15 published novels (and one upcoming one) in the DCI Harry Grimm series by British writer David Gatward. It\u2019s a fast-paced read with an unusual hero and leavened with just the right amount of humor. I read the book as a trial, unsure whether I\u2019d like it nor not, and I liked it so much that I immediately ordered the second, \u201cBest Served Cold.\u201dIn addition to the DCI Harry Grimm series, Gatward has published children\u2019s and teen fiction, taught creative writing sessions, worked as an editor, started a small publishing firm, and returned to writing when the COVID pandemic arrived. He grew up in the Cotswolds and Yorkshire in England (including the town for the setting of Grimm Up North), and he\u2019s also lived in Lincolnshire and the Lake District.It's always an unexpected pleasure to discover a new mystery series, and if the first is any indication, I will be kept busy and entertained with the next 15.",

                "reviewText": "I happen to be going to the Yorkshire Dales in September, and I came across this series on Kindle Unlimited while browsing for a UK Police Procedural to read. That it takes place in places I'm going to visit is, well, a little creepy, but as a fan of UK Police dramas, it's quite good.If you've ever had the eerie feeling watching All Creatures Great and Small that any minute a quirky DCI would show up to solve a grim murder, this will put your mind at ease. DCI Harry Grimm is the classic tough city cop sent to the country to chill, but trouble doesn't have to follow him, it's already there waiting.At first, his secondment to the bucolic countryside populated by farmers and tourists seems like the perfect place to go stir crazy, but then a teen goes missing, and soon enough there's a body by a lake and despite his new Superindendent's admonishments to not disrupt the idyl of the dales, as if his IED scarred face wasn't enough to do the job proper like, Harry just has to roll up his sleeves and do the job.As the first book, it naturally introduces the recurring cast, all of whom turn out to be pretty credible cops, considering Harry's expectations, and you have to wonder if the BBC might want to give this a look. After all, they've already got the sets built...Very nicely done.",

I love books and movies that feature DCI\u2019s etc. Not sure why. Anyway, Harry Grimm is a character that I fell in love with after the first couple of pages. He\u2019s rough around the edges. But a very likable character. He says what\u2019s on his mind and whoever be damned who doesn\u2019t like it. That and his actions caused him to be up north from Bristol. He has demons that he is fighting but he\u2019s trying to make things right. But he has a passion to do good. And that is what he tries to do in his new home. He hated being there, but in my opinion the more he started working with his new team the more he starts to like it. And once he sinks he teeth into a case his passion comes out to find the truth",

The storyline flows along and the character development is really well done. There are some laughs along the way and the description of the Wensleydale area makes me want to go and see for myself. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in crime, interesting characters and North Yorkshire.",
