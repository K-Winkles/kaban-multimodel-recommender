After more than a decade, when sisters Nikki, Sami, and Tori Knotek hear the word mom, it claws like an eagle\u2019s talons, triggering memories that have been their secret since childhood. Until now. For years, behind the closed doors of their farmhouse in Raymond, Washington, their sadistic mother, Shelly, subjected her girls to unimaginable abuse, degradation, torture, and psychic terrors. Through it all, Nikki, Sami, and Tori developed a defiant bond that made them far less vulnerable than Shelly imagined. Even as others were drawn into their mother\u2019s dark and perverse web, the sisters found the strength and courage to escape an escalating nightmare that culminated in multiple murders. Harrowing and heartrending, If You Tell is a survivor\u2019s story of absolute evil - and the freedom and justice that Nikki, Sami, and Tori risked their lives to fight for. Sisters forever, victims no more, they found a light in the darkness that made them the resilient women they are today - loving, loved, and moving on. Read more",

                "reviewText": "Riveting and soul crushing, I couldn\u2019t put this book down. My first time reading anything by Gregg Olsen. I\u2019m not well versed in non-fiction, but I thought he did a fantastic job at making me feel horrified and angry for these three sisters who grew up in abject terror of their mother and did everything in their power to just make it out alive. At times I was shocked at all the times no one did anything to leave or get help. But I forget how pervasive fear is. The whole \u201cdon\u2019t rock the boat\u201d mentality. I should know better because I was raised by a violently turbulent mother who could be the sweetest, funniest and lovable person and in matter of seconds (always feels instantaneous) turn into the devil. I saw a little bit of myself in each of the sisters. The living inside your head fantasizing about revenge or better yet leaving them behind and forgotten for good and then the sicker and more confusing part of you that still loves them and yearns for the unconditional love in return. But this mother was unhinged 24/7 and completely unredeemable. EVIL. These children were conditioned their entire lives by this \u201cmaster manipulator\u201d (gaslighting a very powerful tactic) that this is what family is. This what\u2019s normal behavior. But they knew deep in their souls that this wasn\u2019t right. The children I could understand. They were too afraid to speak out because they had been taught that they had no where to go. Their worse fear was that no one would believe them (because sometimes they had a hard time believing, \u201caka understanding\u201d it themselves) and being brought to even greater heights of torture in retaliation. What I had trouble fathoming were the so called adults. I suppose that shouldn\u2019t have shocked me either, because I\u2019m more than aware that most adults don\u2019t have it all together and can live the majority of their lives in a perpetual state of ignorance. It\u2019s so easy. Out of sight out of mind and all that nonsense. But some people, like Shelly, who was referenced as an apex predator throughout this story had that uncanny ability to sense and then weed out the very vulnerable. People who needed a friend. Were given the barest of minimums in kindness and support and then had it all taken away. By that point they were already in too deep to really understand what they had gotten themselves into. Broke my heart. There are so many lost souls in this world just trying to figure things out and at the same time willing to give everything they have to offer to others. Making it easier to be taken advantage of, which would be bad enough. But these unfortunate souls had the bad luck to make contact with Shelly. And be sucked into her abyss of gaslighting, finger pointing and violent rhetoric that had everyone under her roof a husk of their former selves. And that\u2019s what she thrived off of. Like a vampire sucking the life out of her intended victim. She\u2019d drain them of their confidence, free will and any sense of purpose until they were as empty as she was. It\u2019s hard to imagine that some people are just born evil. But I 100% believe that Shelly is one of those people. Maybe she\u2019s missing something in her brain that provides the ability to truly empathize with others and know what it means to do right by someone other than themselves. But Shelly lacked all of the qualities that make us truly human. I know we all have the ability to be savage and take on the world when we\u2019re being cornered. But Shelly, even as a little girl relished in her ability to be rotten. There was a family history of abuse and neglect. Maybe it was in the blood or learned behavior? Maybe it was too late for Shelly to change by the time she was already brought to live with her estranged father at 6 years old? That\u2019s terrifying. There are no answers as to why this woman did what she did. It\u2019s frustrating that so many people were aware of the situation and did nothing, but it\u2019s not hard to understand why. If not for her inherent laziness and her incredible sense of entitlement, she could have been the leader of a cult that took over entire communities or a country if her vision went beyond just humiliating and dominating over one person at a time. She was so very good at lying and manipulating. Not everyone bought into. But she knew how to pick her battles and who to mess with. She was always in it to win it. She just never realized that her crimes would come to light by her own daughters. Her original victims. The girls by all accounts should have been her own mirror images. But they were born with a conscious. And after years of trying to make it out and stay out they could finally do the one thing that was never an option before. Stand up to the monster. I\u2019m emotionally wrecked after reading this. But it\u2019s paced so well and the subject matter really hits home. Triggering for sure, but written in a way that makes it hard to put down. Sorry for this incredibly long and irrelevant review.",

These poor children endured not only physical abuse but also mental abuse at the hands of someone who was supposed to love them! Shelly, in my opinion suffered from a variety of mental illnesses and unfortunately never received treatment for them. That doesn\u2019t excuse her sadistic behavior but I kept thinking why didn\u2019t anyone call the police? Tell a teacher or a guidance counselor? But then I realized the mental abuse she inflicted caused them to not tell. I don\u2019t know how the legal system works in Washington state, but they should\u2019ve thrown her under the jail and put her on death row!",

The part of me who loves a good crime novel didn\u2019t want this book to end but I had to keep reminding myself that this REALLY happened to people. My heart goes out to Kathy and Ron\u2019s family. My heart goes out to Shane who had so much life left to live. My heart goes out to the sisters. I will carry this book and the weight of it in my heart from now on. I feel like I was right there watching it all unfold. Gregg Olson did an amazing job writing this book, I love how he included how he spoke with Danny. It kinda changed my thought process of Danny a little. Although he did awful things, he too was a victim of Shelly\u2019s mind control.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars \"If You Leave\" Sells the Drama More than Tells the Story",
                "reviewText": "As has been noted in quite a few reviews for \"If You Tell: A True Story of Murder, Family Secrets, and the Unbreakable Bond of Sisterhood,\" this is a book that is simultaneously a rather brutal read yet also a remarkably compelling one.\"If You Tell\" is based upon the true story of an almost unfathomably abusive family led by the iron first of Shelly Knotek, a domineering woman whose abusive ways seemingly have no explanation yet whose ways are inflicted upon nearly everyone who crosses her path including boyfriends, husbands, her three children (Nikki, Sami, and Tori), and some misguided souls who unfortunately cross her path and pay the ultimate price.\"If You Tell\" goes into detail, brutally so, regarding the emotional, physical, and sexual abuse of the three children and the impact it had on their inability to end the cycle until lives had been lost including those of at least two boarders. \"If You Tell\" also provides remarkable detail regarding these crimes, as well.This isn't a book for the timid reader. Best-selling author Gregg Olsen doesn't shy away from the brutality of this household and these crimes. A good majority of the book is centered around these actions, while only a brief section in the beginning goes into Shelly's early years and an even more brief section at the end goes into the post-conviction lives of the three girls who seemingly have managed to build normal lives despite childhoods that were anything but normal.Several of the reviews have commented with disbelief regarding the actions, an understandable and even refreshing response given one would like to believe that everything that unfolds in \"If You Tell\" is the exception and not the rule. It's difficult to fathom a parent being this brutal to so many people and so many people for so many years simply not reporting it.While we could spend days discussing the cycle of trauma that helps to explain the lack of reporting, to a healthy heart and mind it's simply difficult to believe.In some ways, \"If You Tell\" reminded me of one of Indiana's most famous homicide cases - that of Sylvia Likens in 1965 when a young teenager who'd been staying with a neighbor while her parents were traveling with a circus ended up being brutally assaulted/murdered by the mother, her daughter, and several neighborhood children. The same kind of questions arose to the surface - \"How could a family do such things?,\" \"How could children be involved?,\" and \"How did no one notice until it was too late?\"While it's important to note that the children were not involved, other than simply being aware of it and being too terrified to report it and being under a sort of authoritarian spell by a mother who could justify anything, the dynamics are very similar in the stories.If there's a beef I have with the book, and there is, it's that Olsen focuses so much energy on detailing the brutality yet does a relatively weak job of setting up the characters in the story and an even weaker job in providing a satisfying ending. Without giving the ending away, there's so many possible ways to explore questions, pending issues, and possible conflicts that aren't that far off in the future that \"If You Tell\" feels incomplete and, in the end, feels like it's exploiting the story and its subjects.While there's a possible reason to document the stories so brutally, and as someone who has written a book myself from the perspective of being a survivor, it's ultimately the structure of the book that I find insufficient as I wanted more about the lives of the three sisters and how they are ultimately preparing for the future. There is reference to the relationship with the father, but it's practically an afterthought.While \"If You Tell\" is far from a weak book, it's ultimately a book that sells the drama more than tells the story. The survivors deserved much more than that.",

Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent.Pendant des ann\u00e9es, derri\u00e8re les portes ferm\u00e9es de leur ferme \u00e0 Raymond, dans l\u2019\u00c9tat de Washington, leur m\u00e8re sadique, Shelly, a soumis ses filles \u00e0 des abus inimaginables, \u00e0 la d\u00e9gradation, \u00e0 la torture et aux terreurs psychiques. \u00c0 travers tout cela, Nikki, Sami et Tori ont d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 un lien d\u00e9fiant qui les a rendus beaucoup moins vuln\u00e9rables que ce que Shelly imaginait. Alors m\u00eame que d\u2019autres \u00e9taient entra\u00een\u00e9es dans la toile sombre et perverse de leur m\u00e8re, les s\u0153urs ont trouv\u00e9 la force et le courage d\u2019\u00e9chapper \u00e0 un cauchemar qui a culmin\u00e9 dans de multiples meurtres.Poignant et d\u00e9chirant, \"If You Tell\" est l\u2019histoire d\u2019un survivant du mal absolu, et de la libert\u00e9 et de la justice pour lesquelles Nikki, Sami et Tori ont risqu\u00e9 leur vie. S\u0153urs pour toujours, plus jamais victimes, elles ont trouv\u00e9 une lumi\u00e8re dans l\u2019obscurit\u00e9 qui a fait d\u2019elles les femmes r\u00e9silientes qu\u2019elles sont aujourd\u2019hui \u2014 aimantes, aim\u00e9es et en mouvement. Livre tr\u00e8s bien \u00e9crit par Gregg Olsen, auteur \u00e0 succ\u00e8s du New-York Times qui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9criture du fort bien document\u00e9 \"If I can't have you\", sur l'histoire de Susan Cox-Powell. D'un anglais facile, je recommande le livre et l'auteur.",
