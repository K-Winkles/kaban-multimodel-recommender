Provided a stipend to make sure he didn't starve but they didn't want to be associated with this ridiculous private detective idea. So the idea that he can't accept a younger sister not being interested in playing society's idea of a proper girl or deal with a mother who also won't accept society's expectations doesn't really fit. His fascination with \"the woman\" also doesn't fit with this idea.But other than that the art s quite good and the stories decent enough. Don't expect anything you can't figure out yourself.",
