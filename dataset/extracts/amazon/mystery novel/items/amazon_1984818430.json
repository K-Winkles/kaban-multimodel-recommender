            "Editorial Reviews Review \u201cStealthily surprising and very moving . . . absolutely a must-read.\u201d\u2014Booklist (starred review) \u201cA satisfying and thought-provoking narrative.\u201d\u2014Minneapolis Star Tribune\u201cJodi Picoult once again proves she is the master of wading through the darkness to find the light.\u201d\u2014Taylor Jenkins Reid, New York Times bestselling author of Malibu Rising\u201cWish You Were Here is a transporting and transcendent novel about seeking out glimmers of light in the darkness, and following them wherever they lead. Jodi Picoult is that rare, one-in-a-million writer whose books both squeeze your heart and expand your mind. Her latest is wise, surprising, and utterly extraordinary.\u201d\u2060\u2014Emily Henry, #1 New York Times bestselling author of People We Meet on Vacation and Beach Read\u201cIn Wish You Were Here, Jodi Picoult does something brilliant, cracking open something extraordinary. I am just overwhelmed by this book. I actually finished it at three in the morning and started reading it again.\u201d\u2060\u2014Caroline Leavitt, New York Times bestselling author of With or Without You About the Author Jodi Picoult is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of twenty-seven novels, including The Book of Two Ways, A Spark of Light, Small Great Things, Leaving Time, The Storyteller, Lone Wolf, Sing You Home, House Rules, Handle with Care, Change of Heart, and My Sister's Keeper, and, with daughter Samantha van Leer, two young adult novels, Between the Lines and Off the Page. Picoult lives in New Hampshire. Excerpt. \u00a9 Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. OneMarch 13, 2020When I was six years old, I painted a corner of the sky. My father was working as a conservator, one of a handful restoring the zodiac ceiling on the main hall of Grand Central Terminal\u2014an aqua sky strung with shimmering constellations. It was late, way past my bedtime, but my father took me to work because my mother\u2014as usual\u2014was not home.He helped me carefully climb the scaffolding, where I watched him working on a cleaned patch of the turquoise paint. I looked at the stars representing the smear of the Milky Way, the golden wings of Pegasus, Orion\u2019s raised club, the twisted fish of Pisces. The original mural had been painted in 1913, my father told me. Roof leaks damaged the plaster, and in 1944, it had been replicated on panels that were attached to the arched ceiling. The original plan had been to remove the boards for restoration, but they contained asbestos, and so the conservators left them in place, and went to work with cotton swabs and cleaning solution, erasing decades of pollutants.They uncovered history. Signatures and inside jokes and notes left behind by the original artists were revealed, tucked in among the constellations. There were dates commemorating weddings, and the end of World War II. There were names of soldiers. The birth of twins was recorded near Gemini.An error had been made by the original artists, so that the painted zodiac was reversed from the way it would appear in the night sky. Instead of correcting it, though, my father was diligently reinforcing the error. That night, he was working on a small square of space, gilding stars. He had already painted over the tiny yellow dots with adhesive. He covered these with a piece of gold leaf, light as breath. Then he turned to me. \u201cDiana,\u201d he said, holding out his hand, and I climbed up in front of him, caged by the safety of his body. He handed me a brush to sweep over the foil, fixing it in place. He showed me how to gently rub at it with my thumb, so that the galaxy he\u2019d created was all that remained.When all the work was finished, the conservators kept a small dark spot in the northwest corner of Grand Central Terminal, where the pale blue ceiling meets the marble wall. This nine-by-five-inch section was left that way intentionally. My father told me that conservators do that, in case historians need to study the original composition. The only way you can tell how far you\u2019ve come is to know where you started.Every time I\u2019m in Grand Central Terminal, I think about my father. Of how we left that night, hand in hand, our palms glittering like we had stolen the stars.It is Friday the thirteenth, so I should know better. Getting from Sotheby\u2019s, on the Upper East Side, to the Ansonia, on the Upper West Side, means taking the Q train to Times Square and then the 1 uptown, so I have to travel in the wrong direction before I start going in the right one.I hate going backward.Normally I would walk across Central Park, but I am wearing a new pair of shoes that are rubbing a blister on my heel, shoes I never would have worn if I\u2019d known that I was going to be summoned by Kitomi Ito. So instead, I find myself on public transit. But something\u2019s off, and it takes me a moment to figure out what.It\u2019s quiet. Usually, I have to fight my way through tourists who are listening to someone singing for coins, or a violin quartet. Today, though, the atrium is empty.Last night Broadway theaters had shut down performances for a month, after an usher tested positive for Covid, out of an abundance of caution. That\u2019s what Finn said, anyway\u2014New York\u2013Presbyterian, where he is a resident, has not seen the influx of coronavirus cases that are appearing in Washington State and Italy and France. There were only nineteen cases in the city, Finn told me last night as we watched the news, when I wondered out loud if we should start panicking yet. \u201cWash your hands and don\u2019t touch your face,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine.\u201dThe uptown subway is nearly empty, too. I get off at Seventy-second and emerge aboveground, blinking like a mole, walking at a brisk New Yorker clip. The Ansonia, in all its glory, rises up like an angry djinn, defiantly jutting its Beaux Arts chin at the sky. For a moment, I just stand on the sidewalk, looking up at its mansard roof and its lazy sprawl from Seventy-third to Seventy-fourth Street. There\u2019s a North Face and an American Apparel at ground level, but it wasn\u2019t always this bougie. Kitomi told me that when she and Sam Pride moved in in the seventies, the building was overrun with psychics and mediums, and housed a swingers\u2019 club with an orgy room and an open bar and buffet. Sam and I, she said, would stop in at least once a week.I was not alive when Sam\u2019s band, the Nightjars, was formed by Sam and his co-songwriter, William Punt, with two school chums from Slough, England. Nor was I when their first album spent thirty weeks on the Billboard charts, or when their little British quartet went on The Ed Sullivan Show and ignited a stampede of screaming American girls. Not when Sam married Kitomi Ito ten years later or when the band broke up, months after their final album was released featuring cover art of Kitomi and Sam naked, mirroring the figures in a painting that hung behind their bed. And I wasn\u2019t alive when Sam was murdered three years later, on the steps of this very building, stabbed in the throat by a mentally ill man who recognized him from that iconic album cover.But like everyone else on the planet, I know the whole story.The doorman at the Ansonia smiles politely at me; the concierge looks up as I approach. \u201cI\u2019m here to see Kitomi Ito,\u201d I say coolly, pushing my license across the desk to her.\u201cShe\u2019s expecting you,\u201d the concierge answers. \u201cFloor\u2014\u201d\u201cEighteen. I know.\u201dLots of celebrities have lived at the Ansonia\u2014from Babe Ruth to Theodore Dreiser to Toscanini to Natalie Portman\u2014but arguably, Kitomi and Sam Pride are the most famous. If my husband had been murdered on the front steps of my apartment building, I might not have stayed for another thirty years, but that\u2019s just me. And anyway, Kitomi is finally moving now, which is why the world\u2019s most infamous rock widow has my number in her cellphone.What is my life, I think, as I lean against the back wall of the elevator.When I was young, and people asked what I wanted to do when I grew up, I had a whole plan. I wanted to be securely on a path to my career, to get married by thirty, to finish having kids by thirty-five. I wanted to speak fluent French and have traveled cross-country on Route 66. My father had laughed at my checklist. You, he told me, are definitely your mother\u2019s daughter.I did not take that as a compliment.Also, for the record, I\u2019m perfectly on track. I am an associate specialist at Sotheby\u2019s\u2014Sotheby\u2019s!\u2014and Eva, my boss, has hinted in all ways possible that after the auction of Kitomi\u2019s painting I will likely be promoted. I am not engaged, but when I ran out of clean socks last weekend and went to scrounge for a pair of Finn\u2019s, I found a ring hidden in the back of his underwear drawer. We leave tomorrow on vacation and Finn\u2019s going to pop the question there. I\u2019m so sure of it that I got a manicure today instead of eating lunch.And I\u2019m twenty-nine.The door to the elevator opens directly into Kitomi\u2019s foyer, all black and white marble squares like a giant chessboard. She comes into the entryway, dressed in jeans and combat boots and a pink silk bathrobe, with a thatch of white hair and the purple heart-shaped spectacles for which she is known. She has always reminded me of a wren, light and hollow-boned. I think of how Kitomi\u2019s black hair went white overnight with grief after Sam was murdered. I think of the photographs of her on the sidewalk, gasping for air.\u201cDiana!\u201d she says, as if we are old friends.There is a brief awkwardness as I instinctively put my hand out to take hers and then remember that is not a thing we are doing anymore and instead just give a weird little wave. \u201cHi, Kitomi,\u201d I say.\u201cI\u2019m so glad you could come today.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. There are a lot of sellers who want to make sure the paperwork is handed over personally.\u201dOver her shoulder, at the end of a long hallway, I can see it\u2014the Toulouse-Lautrec painting that is the entire reason I know Kitomi Ito. She sees my eyes dart toward it and her mouth tugs into a smile.\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d I say. \u201cI never get tired of seeing it.\u201dA strange flicker crosses Kitomi\u2019s face. \u201cThen let\u2019s get you a better view,\u201d she replies, and she leads me deeper into her home.

        "description": "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 From the author of Small Great Things and The Book of Two Ways comes \u201ca powerfully evocative story of resilience and the triumph of the human spirit\u201d (Taylor Jenkins Reid, author of The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and Daisy Jones & The Six)Rights sold to Netflix for adaptation as a feature film \u2022 Named one of the best books of the year by She ReadsDiana O\u2019Toole is perfectly on track. She will be married by thirty, done having kids by thirty-five, and move out to the New York City suburbs, all while climbing the professional ladder in the cutthroat art auction world. She\u2019s an associate specialist at Sotheby\u2019s now, but her boss has hinted at a promotion if she can close a deal with a high-profile client. She\u2019s not engaged just yet, but she knows her boyfriend, Finn, a surgical resident, is about to propose on their romantic getaway to the Gal\u00e1pagos\u2014days before her thirtieth birthday. Right on time.But then a virus that felt worlds away has appeared in the city, and on the eve of their departure, Finn breaks the news: It\u2019s all hands on deck at the hospital. He has to stay behind. You should still go, he assures her, since it would be a shame for all of their nonrefundable trip to go to waste. And so, reluctantly, she goes.Almost immediately, Diana\u2019s dream vacation goes awry. Her luggage is lost, the Wi-Fi is nearly nonexistent, and the hotel they\u2019d booked is shut down due to the pandemic. In fact, the whole island is now under quarantine, and she is stranded until the borders reopen. Completely isolated, she must venture beyond her comfort zone. Slowly, she carves out a connection with a local family when a teenager with a secret opens up to Diana, despite her father\u2019s suspicion of outsiders.In the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, where Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution by natural selection was formed, Diana finds herself examining her relationships, her choices, and herself\u2014and wondering if when she goes home, she too will have evolved into someone completely different.This edition contains a short story, discussion questions, and an excerpt from Jodi Picoult\u2019s next novel.",

My wife had a Zars type of pneumonia in 2014, and spent 28 days in a medically induced coma, intubated the entire time. She spent another 5 weeks in a rehabilitation hospital and required a small army of home care specialists for many months. Near death she was proned after the first week and then many times throughout her induced coma. There is no question that proning was the key to her survival ! Which her doctors described as a miracle !Her dreams throughout her nightmare were many and as real and vivid as Ms Picoult so expertly described. For years, during and after her recovery, she would question me intensely, \u201care you sure that this or that didn\u2019t happen\u201d or, \u201csurely so and so did this and that\u201d and so very many other questions Re her extremely lucid memories of a myriad of things that she was positive happened, but did not !My wife was emotionally stunned and delighted with Ms Picoult,s imagery of how shockingly real her narratives described the life that she lived in her mind for 28 days. I would love to see the movie version.A very sincere thank you Jodi Picoult.",

                "reviewText": "I haven't finished this book and I probably won't. I feel I've gone far enough (just over halfway) to competently write about why I am not going to bother and why I am so annoyed. Sorry to the author but she can withstand some negative reviews I'm sure. First, I am a fan of the author. Some of her books, a lot actually, are just terrific reads. I wanted to read this because I can't think of anything more compelling than writing about the horrific pandemic we are all enduring. But what a let down. I expected more from this author. This felt contrived and as though social credibility boxes were being ticked off, one by one (Halal?) which is really just an aside so I won't even bother with more of that. First major annoyance: The obvious Yoko Ono character - seriously? Was that intentional? Bizarre. But, ok, never mind all that. What about the read and the main characters? Credit where die: I thought she did a good job portraying what it must have been like to be a healthcare worker in NYC and maybe that's where this book should have focused straight through. Perhaps it even did later but I couldn't suffer one more minute with the main character frankly, a woman who was stupid enough to walk in the opposite direction of everyone else leaving an island during the pandemic. Really? Then, as she received emails from her boyfriend, the doctor in NY who was in serious psychological anguish and horror and physical danger working the front lines of Covid, she never seemed particularly moved by what he was going through but instead writing him about turtles in the Galapagos. Hello, anyone home? Did she ever acknowledge the hellscape he was living in? I didn't notice if she did. I would have rowed home if that were my boyfriend but no, she wasn't horrified apparently. Just angry he pushed her to go but not really meaning it. Meanwhile, she's falling for another man who of course understands life so much better than anyone else because he lives it simply on an island, far from the trappings of superficiality in America. Ugh. Why is this theme repeated in so many books? So predictable. Gruff man with sensitive heart. Yawn. I just couldn't go on. The main character and her hosts on the island were so unoriginal it was brutal - the brooding but sensitive Gabriel, the lonely and misunderstood daughter, and the grandmother with the ever present food...ugh, ugh, ugh. And again, the woman with her life mapped out who finds meaning finally when she communes with nature and brooding men. So sorry, hate to trash a book. There was nothing wrong with the writing on a mechanical level and I wouldn't expect there to be. The author is a terrific writer hence her success. But it would have been nice to see the main character a bit more alarmed and unnerved while her boyfriend suffered at home then her tiptoeing through the tulips thousands of miles away, contemplating her navel and lusting over moody man. I couldn't stand the main character. That's a problem.",

                "reviewText": "This is ostensibly a Covid story. A young woman gets the virus and nearly dies, but while she's unconscious she lives a whole different existence. When she recovers, she finds she prefers the dreamed experience to her real life.Picoult uses this vehicle to recount the very real and terrible effects of Covid in New York City beginning with the chaos and lack of understanding that characterised it. But it also gives her an opportunity to examine the nature of reality and our perception of time.I have given the book a 4 because at times I felt the research needed to write the book came across as an info dump rather than emerging organically. And I found the chief character, Diana, unconvincingly drawn and hard to like. She seemed more a collection of traits than a real person. She's a business woman, an artist, a teacher, a counselor... but very unkind to the man who stands by her when she's ill.Picault is very good at taking social issues and turning them into very readable novels. I don't think this is her best, but she's an accomplished writer and always tells a good story.",

Books that make you forget to eat and drink, that make you forget time and place and leave you breathless. \"Wish You Were Here\" by Jodi Picoult is such a book. I can say from my deepest heart that this book is definitely going to be one of the best books I have read in a long time.Plot:Diana O'Toole has it all: A handsome and successful boyfriend, a promising career at Sotheby's and all her future life goals already mapped out, like being married at 30, having two kids at 35 while at the same time climbing the professional ladder in the art auction world. What is more, she is convinced that Finn, her boyfriend, is going to propose to her on their upcoming trip to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.But then Covid19 comes along. Finn, a surgical resident, has to stay behind at the hospital but urges Diana to make the trip alone.The moment Diana arrives at theGal\u00e1pagos Islands, the whole place is put under quarantine. Everything is shut down and she needs the help of a local family to find a place to stay. Stripped of almost everything - her luggage got lost and she's running out of money - she explores the beauty of the islands and meets people who will change her forever. Suddenly she starts questioning everything that has seemed so important to her, and she wonders if she will be a completely different person when she goes back home again.Well, and then a plot twist comes along that really left me speechless. I didn't see it coming and I couldn't have seen it coming. I'm not going to say anything more about it, just this: Please read this book!!!!!",
