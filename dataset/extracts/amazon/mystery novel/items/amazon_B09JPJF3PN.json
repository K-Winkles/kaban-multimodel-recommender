I succumbed to temptation and read it, and my trepidation was rewarded. I have enjoyed all of Mr. Kruger's books and have gotten some other hooked on them. I've always told them to read them in order because the family is as important as any other element in the book. This book is a tension-filled chase story, and that whole McGuffin may not please you, but it's only the story gimmick to get us as readers out in the wood with the wonderful Henry, and I won't say anymore because I want you to read the book and find the internal surprises just like I did. The prose is simple and straight forward, the story is good, the characters are warm and real, so what's left but to enjoy.",
