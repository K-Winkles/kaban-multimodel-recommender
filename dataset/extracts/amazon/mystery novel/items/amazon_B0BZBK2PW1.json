                "reviewText": "Another heart-wrenching book from Sara/Jen. From start to finish, this took me on a roller coaster of emotions. Of course I knew going in what the book was about -- a building collapse in DC -- so it wasn't a surprise, but that didn't lessen the impact it had on me when I \"learned\" about it along with Meg. And as someone who grew up and lived only 40 minutes from Oklahoma City in 1995 when the Murrah building was bombed, this seemed to hit me in a different way than Sara's other FBI K-9 books have. Definitely more personal. It was incredibly moving to see the tragedy from the rescuers' POVs. Of course, we've seen that in the previous 7 books, but it was somehow more intense this time around, even though you were pretty sure you knew how it was going to turn out.I loved so much the interactions between Meg and Todd, Meg and Cara, Meg and McCord, and of course, as always, Meg and Hawk. There were also some great scenes with the four of them together that were fantastic, along with Meg and her team. And the final couple of chapters were some of the best in a book full of great ones. Overall, a fantastic read and another perfect addition to one of my favorite series.",

That being said - I\u2019m hungry for more adventures with these characters. Is this really the final book in this series? I would give all others in the series 5 stars!!!",

                "reviewText": "That Others May Live will remind readers of the collapse of the Champlain Towers South in Surfside Florida a few years ago. And that\u2019s intentional. \u201cDriscoll\u201d knew she wanted to tackle the idea of a major building collapse. It\u2019s an emotional read. Meg and Hawk are called out in the early morning as soon as the collapse of a condo building in downtown DC is known. Todd is already on the job, so he is also a first responder.Driscoll takes us through each excruciating moment of trying to rescue people after a twelve story building comes down. Endless to say, the rescues are few. The first half of the book is taken up with this. It\u2019s not until the book moves into the second half that she explores why the collapse occurred. It then becomes a little technical, which was fine by me. I like when authors don\u2019t assume their fiction readers can\u2019t handle science or engineering. The tempo of the book remains low key yet it totally captures the stress of working in such a volatile situation. Those looking for a high octane finish will be disappointed.Sara Driscoll was the pseudonym used by Ann Vanderlaan and Jenna Danna. Ann passed away last year, so it is now just Jenna writing the books. The writing did feel a bit different, but it still incorporated the detailed descriptions of how the dogs work.I have read the entire series, but I do think the book could easily be read as a stand-alone.My thanks to Netgalley and Kensington Books for an advance copy of this book.",
