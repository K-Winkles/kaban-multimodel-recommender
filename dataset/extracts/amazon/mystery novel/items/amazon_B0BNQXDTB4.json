When he is found dead, there is no shortage of suspects. While investigating, Flora is targeted in increasingly personal ways. Can she and Jack discover the killer?MAAF is my favorite book in the series so far. First, because Flora and Jack are in love and that makes me so happy. Second, the story was hyper local. It is all about village politics and life in Abbeymead. There are village meetings! Extreme grudges! Bonkers villagers! Truly all of my favorite things. And I loved the mystery itself. Such a satisfying read.This is the last book for now, but a new one is coming out in a few months (just in time for my birthday!) and I am so excited!",

Of course they want to find out what happened, but once they start investigating they soon discover a hotbed of controversy, over traditional land use, financial greed and even the movements of villainous gangs in nearby London, not to mention the fact that someone has apparently targeted Flora by attacking all the items that she holds most dear\u2026. I had actually forgotten about the Flora Steele cozy series, of which this is the sixth, until I randomly ran across the author\u2019s name and remembered that I had enjoyed the first five books. Here we have a bit more development in the relationship between Flora and Jack, and we also see the sometimes hidebound attitudes of villagers in a world that is changing around them. I figured out the culprit about halfway through the book, but still enjoyed the setting and the characters, so mildly recommended!",

The sale of Abbeymead Farm is the focal point of the investigation that leaves both Jack and Flora stumped. With the seemingly unrelated psychological attacks on Flora, the author weaves her uneasiness throughout the plot. This uneasiness seems to build a barrier between her and Jack for a good portion of the novel. She does not realize that her happiness is also dependent on her relationship with Jack. Hopefully, in the next novel(s), their differences will be resolved as they find themselves in another investigation.",
