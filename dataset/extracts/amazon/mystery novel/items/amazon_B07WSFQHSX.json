        "description": "A Reese's Book Club Pick\u201cI loved this book. It gave me the same waves of happiness I get from curling up with a classic Christie.... The alternating points of view keep you guessing, and guessing wrong.\u201d (Alex Michaelides, number one New York Times best-selling author of The Silent Patient)\"Evok[es] the great Agatha Christie classics.... Pay close attention to seemingly throwaway details about the characters\u2019 pasts. They are all clues.\u201d (New York Times Book Review)A wedding celebration turns dark and deadly in this deliciously wicked and atmospheric thriller reminiscent of Agatha Christie from the New York Times best-selling author of The Hunting Party.The bride - the plus one - the best man - the wedding planner - the bridesmaid - the body.On an island off the coast of Ireland, guests gather to celebrate two people joining their lives together as one. The groom: handsome and charming, a rising television star. The bride: smart and ambitious, a magazine publisher. It\u2019s a wedding for a magazine or for a celebrity: the designer dress, the remote location, the luxe party favors, the boutique whiskey. The cell phone service may be spotty and the waves may be rough, but every detail has been expertly planned and will be expertly executed.But perfection is for plans, and people are all too human. As the champagne is popped and the festivities begin, resentments and petty jealousies begin to mingle with the reminiscences and well wishes. The groomsmen begin the drinking game from their school days. The bridesmaid not-so-accidentally ruins her dress. The bride\u2019s oldest (male) friend gives an uncomfortably caring toast.And then someone turns up dead. Who didn\u2019t wish the happy couple well? And perhaps more important, why? Read more",

                "reviewText": "I read this for the 52 Week Book Challenge, which challenges you to read a book a week. Week One was on the theme of the \"locked room\" mystery. This novel is a variation of the \"locked room mystery\": that is, the main characters are in a literal or figurative locked room, with no one able to enter or exit, when a crime, usually a murder, occurs. A well-known version of the the \"locked room mystery\" is Agatha Christie's \"Murder on the Orient Express.\" The victim is murdered aboard the famous luxury train while it is moving: hence, the murderer had to be one of the passengers. A key element of the locked-room mystery is the mutual fear and suspicion the characters, who are usually strangers from different walks of life, have for each other. Another element is the claustrophobia as there is no way out of the locked room.In this particular telling of the locked room story, the locked room is an island, the fictional island of Inis, specifically, in a remote area off the Atlantic coast of Connemara, a region in western Ireland. The main characters--the bride, groom, bride's sister, the groomsmen, and so forth--have all gathered there for the destination wedding of Jules, a famous blogger and influencer, and her TV star fiance, Will. The wedding is orchestrated by Aoife, the wedding planner, local, and owner of the inn where the wedding takes place. One of the wedding party will wind up murdered, and the rest of the guests as well as Aoife will fall under suspicion. As is also traditional in this kind of story, most characters have a motive for killing the victim.The story was a little slow at first but picks up in the middle. It is artfully told through multiple points of view of the guests and the wedding planner with their individual perspectives on the other characters and the story events. The narrative also moves back and forth in time, until focusing on that one fateful moment: the murder.This is a worthwhile read for lovers of the mystery genre.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Different than Expected",
                "reviewText": "As one of the most purchased mystery novels of 2020, \u201cThe Guest List\u201d appears to have produced a range of reactions from reviewers. From being hailed as genius to castigated as abysmal, the book has proven to be somewhat divisive among literary fans.Taking place on an island off the coast of Ireland, a power couple consisting of a television star and a magazine publisher are set to be married. Then as the wedding festivities proceed, someone ends up dead. In telling the novel\u2019s events, alternating perspectives are given from several narrators that primarily include the bride herself, the best man, the wedding planner, a plus-one who is married to a friend of the bride, and the bridesmaid who is also the bride\u2019s half-sister. As the narrative progresses, several plot twists occur and the book maintains a suspenseful tone that makes it hard to put down at times.However, a key problem with the book is not necessarily one with the novel itself but with the marketing of it, which affects the expectations of readers. Although branded as a sort of modern whodunit, similar to ones written by Agatha Christie, \u201cThe Guest List\u201d plays out much more like a social drama that happens to culminate in a murder, rather than being a murder mystery in itself. That said, the book does not entail an investigation of a murder that has already happened but instead depicts the making of a murder that has yet to take place. While readers are teased with snippets of a waitress screaming about a dead body on the island and search parties going out to investigate, the vast majority of the book revolves around flashbacks that lead up to the wedding and subsequent murder. Thus, it is not explicitly stated who died until the book itself is nearly over. Thereafter, the murderer is rapidly revealed and despite an epilogue, the novel ends somewhat awkwardly and abruptly. Until the final thirty pages or so, the book\u2019s content revolves around the relationships between the main characters and the secrets that lie in their respective pasts. While some may enjoy the gradual tension, others may find that the book unnecessarily drags things out that have already become obvious. Another feature of the book is that its dialogue tries to be witty and perhaps socially relevant, especially during passages involving sex and online dating habits, but just feels cringeworthy at parts. Although these issues don\u2019t completely render the book meritless, they are consistently aggravating and prevent the storyline from being as well told as it could have been.In general, \u201cThe Guest List\u201d is one of those books that may be a hit or miss for readers. While there\u2019s a neat concept at play, the execution of it could have been better and the format may annoy some, depending on one\u2019s personal preferences. Although a tough book to rate because of its occasional strengths but notable deficiencies, this review\u2019s rating rounds out to three stars because the book\u2019s neither perfect or terrible.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this thinking it was along the lines of a classic whodunit, but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s really more of a suspense/thriller, but it is very slow burn and much of the suspense is generated by the framework of the book (where the story skips around in time). I understand why it\u2019s compared to Agatha Christie, but I think it\u2019s a faulty comparison. Both And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express are actual murder mysteries, where the reader is trying to figure out who the murderer is throughout the book. That is impossible with this book, for reasons I can\u2019t say without spoiling it. That being said, it\u2019s fine as a suspense/thriller novel\u2026maybe better read at a ski resort than the beach given the dreary atmosphere. I took off a star because I don\u2019t think the first person narrative worked - it would have been much better written in third person. Most of the character voices sounded the same, despite being from very different backgrounds. It really started grating after a while.",

Und davon bin ich, ehrlich gesagt, \u00fcberhaupt kein Fan. Oftmals hemmt das den Lesefluss enorm. Doch hier ist dieses wechseln der Erz\u00e4hl-Perspektive fantastisch gelungen.Das Setting ist grund\u00e4tzlich bekannt: Menschen treffen an einem abgeschiedenen Ort zusammen und jemand wird ermordet. Dann beginnt die M\u00f6rdersuche w\u00e4hrend niemand den Ort verlassen kann. Klassisches Murder-Mystery.Doch bei dieser Geschichte ist vieles anders als erwartet und es ist herrlich wie sich am Schluss alles zusammenf\u00fcgt.[English]A real reading pleasure from the beginning. The story is told from different perspectives (from the point of view of different people). And to be honest, I'm not a fan of that at all. Often it inhibits the reading flow enormously. But here this change of narrative perspective is fantastically successful.The setting is basically familiar: People meet in a secluded place and someone is murdered. Then the search for the murderer begins while no one can leave the place. Classic murder-mystery.But in this story, many things are different than expected and it is wonderful how everything comes together in the end.",
