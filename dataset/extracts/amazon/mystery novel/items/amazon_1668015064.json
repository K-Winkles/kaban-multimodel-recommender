This atmospheric novel heralds the arrival of a talented new writer and an unforgettable heroine.\"\u2014Kirkus Reviews (Starred) \u201cMukerji\u2019s taut plotting and vivid depiction of the era\u2019s medical practices and social customs will leave readers eager for a second installment.\u201d\u2014Publishers Weekly (Starred) \"On the surface, this debut by Mukerji, herself a medical doctor, appears to be a mystery about the death of a working-class servant, but it\u2019s much more, as it examines women\u2019s rights, social conditions, and medicine in Philadelphia just a decade after the Civil War. Fans of Maddie Day\u2019s \u201cQuaker Midwife\u201d series will appreciate this detailed historical mystery.\"\u2014Library Journal (Starred) \u201cMurder by Degrees stars a capable, likeable heroine in Dr. Lydia Weston, who battles for acceptance every day as a female doctor in 19th century Philadelphia, and when one of her favorite patients turns up apparently murdered Lydia will need all her diagnostic skills to unmask the killer. Ritu Mukerji\u2014a practicing physician herself, her expertise shining on every page\u2014pens a heartfelt ode to the historic women who blazed a trail in medicine before her as well as a wonderfully entertaining mystery. Hopefully Lydia Weston's adventures will continue in future volumes!\u201d\u2014Kate Quinn, New York Times bestselling author of The Diamond Eye \u201cIn Murder by Degrees, Ritu Mukerji delivers a fresh take on a classic genre. When the smart, compassionate Dr. Lydia Weston teams up with Inspector Volcker to solve the murder of a beloved patient, she proves that science is a formidable truth-teller.

Ritu Mukerji illuminates the little-known history of America\u2019s earliest women physicians through her protagonist Lydia Weston, an unforgettable young woman whose intelligence is equally matched by her compassion. A brilliant start to a series that presents the medical mystery in a feminist light.\"\u2014Sujata Massey, author of The Widows of Malabar Hill \u201cA stunning debut.

Good characterization.What doesn\u2019t work: An overly complicated plot. Too many instances where Dr. Weston is subjected to male chauvinism. Without giving away the plot, one too many murders.An impressive debut mystery.",

                "reviewText": "A murder mystery set in 1875, starring a woman doctor who becomes embroiled in the police investigation when a patient of hers suddenly seems to go missing - and the body they discover in the river matches her description. We follow Lydia as she investigates alongside the police to determine what exactly happened to Anna Ward - and whether it was simply suicide, or if it was murder.This book was a solid mystery novel, where at no point were you completely positive where the investigation was going to go, nor who was actually at fault. I enjoyed Lydia as a character - as a female doctor and a professor at her school educating OTHER women to become a doctor - she has an interesting insight to the events going on around her. I liked that while this was a mystery novel, we do spend a decent portion of the book as Lydia goes about her life and the sexism she faces for her profession.When Lydia finds a personal diary from Anna Ward that seems to contain poetry that alludes to her knowing something that someone might want to keep secret - as well as her being frantic the last time she was seen - it adds intrigue to the case. Was someone hunting her? Did she know a secret she should not have? And while the police focus on interviewing suspects, Lydia focuses on discovering the secrets of the journal - which slowly piece together the events that lead to Anna Ward being found dead.Mystery novels involving a complicated and intricate investigation, where you have many suspects but no clear evidence until the end, can be difficult to pull off properly. This book is able to do it convincingly, where even with there being multiple suspects and culprits, how they all fit together works extremely well. I liked how Lydia was able to work alongside the police for the investigation - but also, when she has her own leads will go off on her own.This is a great murder mystery novel, and the meshing of the investigation with Lydia\u2019s daily life almost felt like I was reading something similar to Katherine Arden\u2019s Cemeteries of Amalo series.I would only caution readers reading this if they are squeamish about descriptions of bodies, surgeries, and autopsies as while the descriptions are not overly graphic, they are described fairly well.",

She thought of the countless times she had sought refuge in her books, when literature had provided the ballast and strength of an old friend.\u201dSynopsis:Philadelphia, 1875: It is the start of term at Woman\u2019s Medical College of Pennsylvania.

But Lydia must act quickly, before she becomes the next target of those who wished to silence Anna.There are quite a few points in the book where medical terms are used, which I have no issue with as I work in medicine, but might stumble you up if you don\u2019t. Overall this was a slower paced murder mystery full of twists, scheming, old school medicine, and \u201clady doctors\u201d that got an awful lot of crap for simply being women. An enjoyable and entertaining read!Thank you to @SimonBooks and @RituMukerji for the #gifted copy.",

For me, this was a fine whodunnit with the right level of historical nuance. It would not be hard to see the storyline as a tv miniseries a la \"The Alienist\" or \"Enola Holmes.\"",

Well written, with details paid to using all five senses to describe scenes and paint a true picture of what the reader was \"seeing\". Masterful use of poetry, some very deliberate quotes while in other places, a mere hint and nod to other famous works. The plot had plenty of conflict and some very unexpected twists!",
