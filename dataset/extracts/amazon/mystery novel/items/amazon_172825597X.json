        "description": "Piper's fall was no accident. Did someone want her dead? It's up to her sister to discover the truth in this shocking new thriller with an unreliable narrator, from the acclaimed author of Little Creeping Things.Piper Sullivan was in a strange hiking accident last month and has been in a coma ever since. Her older sister, Savannah, can't pretend to be optimistic about it; things look bad. Piper will likely never wake up, and Savannah will never get any answers about what exactly happened.But then Savannah finds a note in Piper's locker, inviting Piper to a meeting of their school's wilderness club\u2026at the very place and on the very day that she fell. Which means there was a chance that Piper wasn't alone. Someone might've seen something. Worse, someone might've done something. But who would want to hurt the perfect Piper Sullivan\u2026and why?To discover the truth, Savannah joins the club on their weekend-long camping trip on the same mountain where her sister fell. But she better be careful; everyone in the club is a suspect, and everyone seems to be keeping secrets about that tragic day.And Savannah? She's been keeping secrets, too\u2026Also by Chelsea Ichaso:Little Creeping ThingsPraise for Little Creeping Things:\"Little Creeping Things, with its cast of creepy and untrustworthy characters, will satisfy the appetites of all manner of mystery fans.\"\u2015Booklist\"Ichaso's debut is a riveting whodunnit... a psychological thriller worthy of mystery aficionados.\"\u2015School Library Journal\"The reveal\u2026is both well earned and eerie.\"\u2015Kirkus\"Little Creeping Things is a stunning debut in every sense of the word. From the chilling opening pages to the jaw-dropping final reveal, the pacing is relentless, the twists dizzying.

The writing is simplistic, the story isn't really that deep, and the MC is annoying in a way I haven't found a character to be in a while. Overall, I just wasn't impressed. Thankfully, the book is short.It tries to lead you this way and that, but I had the person responsible pegged not far into the camping trip. If you're looking for a complex read with a ride of a story, this probably isn't for you. I knew the moment I opened the book and saw how large the font was that it was going to be an easy read and took it 12 hours.",
