I\u2019m getting familiar with these characters, from Bill and Cindy to Emily, Krista, Mitch, and the always intriguing Rachel. I may be familiar with Patrick Kelly\u2019s style by now\u2014or it was a lucky guess\u2014but I knew the murderer instantly. That didn\u2019t spoil the story though! The book is set in summer and would make a great read on a deck overlooking the Blue Ridge or while you're dreaming about your next escape.I received an advance copy but my review is all my own.",

                "reviewText": "Summer in Wintergreen sounds idyllic. Beautiful mountain scenes and amazing temperatures become marred when murder takes place. Bill O'Shea has set in to his new home. Having helped with the local police many times, Bill is called to a murder scene. Someone didn't like Lily Wolf. When clues start to stack against Bill's friend and cafe owner, Kim, he must race against time and a overzealous commonwealth attorney to find another suspect. Who else could have murdered Lily? With little known information about the victim, Bill and the Wintergreen police struggle to solve this murder.I love this series. The author draws on his knowledge of the area and the people to make the scenes picturesque and the characters relatable. Add in a mischievous dog and a absent ground hog and you will be pulled to keep turning the pages. Looking forward to Bill O'Shea's next adventure. I received an advanced copy. My review is my own thoughts and feelings.",

But even if one is not familiar with the landmarks, the description of the scenery and interesting characters keeps the suspense alive. The author narrates as if he is talking to you in person, making it feel like you are one of his friends. I am not a murder mystery enthusiast, but enjoyed the suspense until the very end!",
