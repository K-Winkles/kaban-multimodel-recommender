Yet when he disappeared on the first night of a bachelor party camping trip with his best friends in the world, he didn\u2019t leave a trace. What he did leave behind were two heartbroken parents, a crew of guilt-ridden groomsmen, and a pile of clues that don\u2019t add up. Frankie Elkin doesn\u2019t know the woods, but she knows how to find people. So when she reads that Timothy\u2019s father is organizing one last search, she heads to Wyoming. Despite the rescue team\u2019s reluctance, she joins them. But as they hike into the mountains, it becomes clear that there\u2019s something dangerous at work in the woods...or someone who is willing to do anything to stop them from going any further. Running out of time and up against the worst man and nature have to offer, Frankie and the search party will discover what evil awaits those who go one step too far... Read more",

Five friends go camping as a bachelor's party for their friend, Tim. The first night around the fire, they all have way too much to drink. In the middle of the night, they hear screams and find their friend, Scott, missing. Tim, being the experienced hiker/camper goes for help. Scott turns up but Tim never does.Now, years later, these friends, along with some other searchers, including Frankie, go into the mountains to search for Tim's remains. I love survival stories, as I am great at armchair surviving. LOLThis was an action packed thriller. I think it deserves five stars. I hope Lisa Gardner will continue with more books in this series.",
