                "reviewText": "Volume 2 of Joy Ellis' first series--heretofore unpublished-- is as enjoyable as the first book. Like the first, this is a gently-paced book with well-fleshed fully dimensional characters and a well-constructed plot. It delves farther into the world of auras from both a suffering and healing point of view and now contains two friendly spirits and their dogs, spirits who still care about the worldly plane. A slow but quite enjoyable read.While I enjoyed these excursions into the paranormal and the world view they reflect, I suspect I would not read very many more. I am glad that when faced with the necessity of choice, Ellis chose to write police procedurals. I am quite addicted to those and eagerly anticipate each new offering. These two books were fun and an interesting glimpse of Ellis' evolution as a writer, but I vastly prefer her other series.",

                "reviewText": "THE COLOUR OF MYSTERY (Ellie McEwan Mysteries Book #2) by Joy Ellis is the second of two mysteries with paranormal elements written by Ms. Ellis at the beginning of her career and just recently published. This book can be read as a standalone because the reader is brought up to date on important elements from The Aura of Mystery and it is set two years after the first, but I feel it is best to read them in order.Ellie McEwan and Michael Seale are still deciding on what to do with the immense inheritance left to them by their friend Carol two years ago. They have started a Healing Center for specialty care with a variety of specialists and healers. After three respected and loved people commit unimaginable murders and then go into a catatonic-like state, DCI Forman asks for Ellie\u2019s help on this case using her psychic gift once again.This is an engaging mix of paranormal anomalies and police procedural. The characters are well developed and interesting. The mystery plot is suspenseful with help from friends from beyond and law enforcement friends, but at times, especially in the beginning of the story, the pace feels a bit slow. Overall, an intriguing genre mash-up.",

                "reviewText": "Two years have passed since Carole\u2019s death and her vast fortune has passed to Ellie McEwan and Prof Michael Seale. Intent on doing good with it, they have opened the Cavendish-Meyer Healing Centre in an old manor house in Ripley, offering assessments by Ellie and a range of complementary and alternative therapies. Next in their plan is to provide in-patient treatment and, when Ellie\u2019s partner Dr Alice Cross, a specialist in treating Azimah Syndrome, has a new patient in need of urgent help, no time is wasted in refurbishing the second floor ready to receive the young man, Jake Kennedy, and recruiting two very good nurses. With Ellie now living in Snug Cottage with Carole\u2019s spaniels and Michael moving into the annex at the centre, life is perfect. Also back in this story are old faces the Scrubbs, dog walker and doctor\u2019s wife Marie Littlewood and her son Daniel whose health is much improved. Ellie may not be able to see Carole and Vera sometimes but the pair are making their presence felt in other ways, and Ellie will certainly need their watchful eyes and guidance in the days to come after she and Michael receive a chilling warning from them \u2013 there is darkness among them. Meanwhile DCI Bob Foreman, together with DI Jon Leatham and WDS Wendy Brown have a new case \u2013 that of a well-loved teacher who has attacked six children in his charge, killing most of them. Wendy, who has remained close friends with Ellie, spots a link with two other cases, that of a caring nurse killing an elderly patient and a woman suffocating six homeless people she was looking after. The killers seem to have lost their minds. They discuss what could have made these good honest people act so out of character. Could it be mind-altering drugs or something more sinister? Ellie agrees to once more put on the mantle of aura detective and help Surrey Police, Vera and Carole basically giving her no choice in the matter! And Bob and his team desperately need some help as it looks like this strange and bizarre force is not going to stop.What an incredible blend of police procedural and the mystical this is! Following on from book one, An Aura of Mystery, this story brings back the wonderful characters that were introduced and adds some more very likeable and interesting ones. The cross-genre story telling is beautifully done, clearly involving extensive research, an obvious interest in the subject and a little artistic license to bring another thrilling yet very heartwarming tale which I was completely glued to from start to finish! I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t be the only reader who is longing for more in this magical series!!",

I am sure when she plots out her books, she peoples it first. The lovely first two books exemplify this. The crimes are horrendous as we expect, but we feel safe with the guardians and executors that all will be well. The paranormal world is much nicer than the gruesome criminal one.",

Again no spoilers, but I didn\u2019t see the twist at the end - but I never do in any of Joy\u2019s books!. Definitely read book one first though, it\u2019ll give you the background that you need for this story. I like the \u2018other\u2019 element in these books, but am eternally grateful for Joy forging ahead into detective fiction, otherwise we\u2019d never have known the pleasure of her incredible works.",

                "reviewText": "This is book 2 of 2. Ellie McEwan is busy setting up a top class clinic when she hears there are strange events happening which result in people being murdered. Once again she offers her help to DCI Bob Foreman but little does she know, the killings might be closer to home than she expects. This was a good read, although I found some of it quite unbelievable at times. I am also not sure that I really like Ellie, but can't quite explain why. I think I prefer Ms Ellis other series, but I congratulate her on her excellent writing and if the two books in this series are her first written books, that is absolutely amazing.",
