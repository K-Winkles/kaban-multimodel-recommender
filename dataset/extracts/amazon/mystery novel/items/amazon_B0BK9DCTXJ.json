                "reviewText": "Gabriel Allon has been enjoying his retirement from the Office in Venice with his family for a few months. He is restoring an altarpiece that is beneath his skills, but pays the bills. One morning, General Ferreti of Rome\u2019s Art Squad pays a visit to ask Gabriel to help him authenticate a painting by Van Gogh that has recently resurfaced in the palazzo of a South African emigr\u00e9 that has been killed on the Amalfi Coast.Gabriel rightly attributes the painting to Van Gogh, but wonders what could possibly have happened for a thief to leave such a valuable piece behind. The obvious conclusion seems to be that another painting, even more valuable, with the same dimensions, was the target of the heist. And so starts an investigation that moves through the usual European capitals, and this time Denmark, then Russia and Finland, to find the woman who had access to the late South African magnate\u2019s vault during the night, ably disabling his state-of-the-art security system and getting away with a coveted painting. Gabriel is sure she didn\u2019t kill the man, but she may be the next target\u2014if the untimely death of the middle man, a rare books dealer, is any indication.A novel in four parts, The Collector is Silva once again returning close to top form. There\u2019s significantly less padding than in most of his other books, and significantly less pages to read as well, so it feels less than padding and more like the welcomed backstories on recurring characters and the operations they have been involved in that they are supposed to be. The Collector is page-turning and easy to read, with fascinating Van Gogh\u2019s and Vermeer\u2019s details, as well as the story behind the heist at the Isabella Gardner Museum in Boston. Refreshing as well are Irene\u2019s views on climate change (my kind of girl!)His best works have been set in Russia and, as always, this one delivers in spades; the brutality of Russia\u2019s security services and the Russian elite lends well to a novel with the fate of the world at stake. While I don\u2019t agree with the all the politics laid out in the book regarding the Russo-Ukrainian War since that conflagration is a disaster of the West\u2019s making\u2014 Russia oddly playing defense\u2014, I share the sentiment that Mr. Putin isn\u2019t going to go quietly into the night. I agree though, that the nuclear option is starting to look like a much too scary possibility. We must be careful what we wish for, Russia does not respond well to anything other than a strong man, and the amount of nuclear weapons they possess does not lend well to instability or a puppet government with questionable alliances. Just saying\u2026Besides the politics, which I disagree on for the reasons above explained, The Collector is yet another strong entry in the mini-saga of Gabriel Allon vs. Russia\u2019s latest tsar. Entertaining, easy to read, and scarily possible make this entry not to be missed.",

                "reviewText": "Seguo Daniel Silva da alcuni anni, ho letto tutti i suoi libri della serie Gabriel Allon (eccetto uno) e 4 romani fa (dunque circa 4 anni fa) mi ero rassegnata a rinunciare a Gabriel Allon, perch\u00e8 i romanzi erano diventati troppo \"copia incolla\" e alla fine perfino noiosi. Poi hi riprovato qualche mese fa con Portrait of an unknown Woman e... evviva! Il miglior Daniel Silva \u00e8 tornato!! Un mese fa ho letto The Collector e ancora una volta confermo: Daniel Silva \u00e8 tornato alla sua miglior forma.Forse l'ambito dell'arte, del commercio illegale di beni culturali, del problema delle restituzioni di opere sottratte dai nazisti \u00e8 un ambito che gli \u00e8 particolarmente congeniale. Sta di fatto che ho \"divorato\" il libro in 2 giorni. Per cui, chi ha amato Daniel Silva e Gabriel Allon prima maniera, apprezzer\u00e0 anche questo. Unica annotazione: ho letto la versione in inglese, non la traduzione in italiano.Buona lettura!",
