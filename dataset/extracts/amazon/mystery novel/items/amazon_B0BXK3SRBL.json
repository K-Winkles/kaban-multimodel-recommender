                "reviewText": "Martha Ballard, mid-wife and healer, wife of Ephraim, and mother of six surviving children, has delivered hundreds of babies in the last three decades. She never said no to a woman in labor. No matter whether it was daylight or dark or what the weather was in northern Maine, when she was needed, Martha would saddle her horse, Brutus, and go. Daily she faithfully wrote in the leather bound journals her husband bought for her. She documented the weather, each mother and birth she attended, and other pertinent information she had witnessed each day.The book begins with a life entering the world and a life snuffed out and thrown in the iced filled Kennebec River which runs through the middle of community of Hallowell, Maine. It took seven men to cut through the ice and pull the dead man out of the river. Martha was called to identify the body and determine the cause of his death. After examining the body and coming to a decision of how he died, Martha was challenged by the new doctor in town BenjaminPage MD - a smug, Harvard educated, pompous, arrogant physician new to the community. Dr. Page not only challenged her decision as to how the man had died, he continued to be a thorn in her side throughout most of the book.Using Martha Ballard\u2019s actual diaries, Ariel Lawhon has crafted a riveting fictionalized tale of birthing babies, corrupt government officials, biased laws and hard court rulings against women. Of rape. Of murder. Of family and what life was like for women who lived in 18th Century America. Martha was a champion of women\u2019s rights before the term was even coined. When starting this book, immediately reader feels that he or she is part of the community and is invested in Martha\u2019s life and the lives of the vulnerable women she assists. This well written, well researched novel is a five star read for me and one on my favorites so far this year. The action never stops. Make sure you read the author\u2019s extensive notes at the end of the book. You will miss out on the real story if you don\u2019t!The Frozen River is my first Ariel Lawhon book. It will not be my last. Don\u2019t miss this book depicting the incredible strength Martha Ballard displays no matter what she faces.",

                "reviewText": "Oh, what a novel! It just pulled me in and wouldn't let go.Before you read this book, know two important things:1. Clear your schedule! Once you start reading, it will be really (really!) hard to stop. Yes, it's THAT good.2. When you finish it, you will have a whopping book hangover.Magnificently written by Ariel Lawhon, this is page-turning historical fiction wrapped around a murder mystery. It takes place from November 1789 to April 1790 in the small village of Hallowell, Maine during a particularly frigid, icy, and stormy winter. Martha Ballard is a 54-year-old midwife and healer, lovingly married to Ephraim, and mother of six (mostly) grown children. One night in late November after a town dance (called a \"frolic\"), Joshua Burgess is found dead in the mostly frozen Kennebac River. It takes seven men to haul him out. But this isn't a man who drowned. He has distinct rope burns on his neck, indicating a hanging, as well as bruises and broken bones, indicating a beating.The plot thickens. The dead man, along with Joseph North, one of the leading and most powerful citizens of the town, are together accused of brutally raping the minister's wife, Rebecca Foster, who becomes pregnant with the baby of one of the rapists. Was Burgess's murder connected to the rape? Outspoken, fearless Martha is determined to solve this mystery and seek justice for the victims even at great risk to herself and her family.The novel is not only a riveting whodunit with smart twists and turns, but also a brilliant story about life in these difficult times early in our country's history. I was completely captivated reading this imaginative tale with colorful characters, a bit of love and romance, and magnificent storytelling.Be sure to read the \"Author's Note\" at the end, as it describes in detail what is and isn't historical fact in this novel. I was quite surprised at how much of it is true. But don't read the \"Author's Note\" until you have finished the book, as it's filled with story spoilers.Bonus: Quotations from Shakespeare's plays run throughout the novel, and many of them are the best ones\u2014the ones that so eloquently insult and defame. Read them and laugh!",

And for every other woman who lives, suffers, and dies by the mercurial whims of men.\u201c-MarthaFor being a book outside of my norm as of late, this book was marvelous. It had so many parts that both shocked and awed me. Think of \u201cCall The Midwife\u201d with an \u201cOutlander\u201d feel.Martha is the best. She is someone you want on your side because she is a badass and a sweetheart. She will give the shirt off her back but will also make you pay for what you did. Her character was wonderfully written. How loved she is from those in the town, besides those who\u2019s opinions don\u2019t matter, is shown in the writing.Seeing as Martha is a midwife, following along in her daily life as a wife and mother, but adding her chaotic schedule delivering babies, it was a fun ride. Not all of the stories were sunshine and rainbows, but that added to the reality of the story. Giving it something you can connect to as it is pulling you in. Life is not a Hallmark movie were everyone gets along and the worst that could happen is the caterer cancels on you. No, sometimes the cruelty of man comes out and we have to find a way to live life after those events. In this story, there is a respectable amount of good and bad to show life may have it\u2019s bumps, but there is still parts to cherish. Still to make you want to keep going.",

Very interesting indeed to read about all Martha achieved as a midwife ( not one mother she delivered died ). In this fictional novel though, she is also investigating a murder.... Her story reveals a woman very much aware of the low consideration of women even in case of rapes.... Even though she clearly and loudly dared testify in court, her testimony was not taken seriously....The author painted a warm picture of a very lively Martha. I liked her immensely straight from the beginning of the novel! I loved her courage, resilience, her sense of duty and deep love for her family. Martha is also witty and brought a smile to my face many times! Through Martha's story, the legal and social historical background is meticulously revealed. Highly recommended!",

I'm not an avid reader but I would sadly have to say this one of the most dry books I've ever read. I'm disappointed I paid $17 for the Kindle edition. Definitely not worth it in my opinion",
