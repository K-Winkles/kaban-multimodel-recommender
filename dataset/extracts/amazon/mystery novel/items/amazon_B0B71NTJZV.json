This is a story with the themes of birth and death running through it. Husband and wife team Chee and Manuelito have made a trip for some quiet time, but that quickly changes when Bernie\u2019s hike in the desert turns into a run to save her life. Strange things are happening in the desert and it appears to be centered around a local paleontologist. As always, the author weaves in the customs and beliefs of the native people as the mystery unfolds. It will stand alone, but you will get a better introduction to the characters if you start reading the series when Leaphorn is a central character.",

                "reviewText": "The Way of the Bear is the 26th novel in the Leaphorn, Chee, and Manuelito mystery series by Tony and Anne Hillerman, and the eighth since daughter Anne's 2013 reboot of her father's series with Spider Woman's Daughter. (The \"About the Author\" bio at the book's end claims \"This is her eighth novel featuring Bernadette Manuelito and the twenty-fifth in the Leaphorn, Chee & Manuelito series begun by her late father, Tony Hillerman.\" I don't know where the 25/26 discrepancy comes from -- in a series this long, off-by-one errors are easy.)I found this more entertaining than average, mainly because there was always something going on. There's more event and emotion in this one than in the last. If, however, you are a more traditional mystery reader, you might be disappointed in this one, because the mystery is largely spoiled by a short early chapter in which the identity of the main culprit is revealed. If like me you are not personally invested in solving the mystery for yourself, this will not bother you.Most of the action takes place at the USA's newest National Park, Bear's Ears National Monument, which was protected because of its large heritage of fossils and early human remains. Several of the main characters are paleontologists and archaeologists. Although I have no doubt that paleontology is as scientifically exciting as here presented, I seriously doubt that many practitioners find in it a path to fabulous wealth, or a motivation for murder. (It is possible that I am just ignorant of the fossil black market.)This one is entirely about Bernie and Chee, who are together at Bear's Ears for most of the story. (Joe Leaphorn is still in Hawaii with Louisa.) Both are going through some things, and Bernie in particular is in an emotionally fragile state for most of the book. Now, if you've read previous books in the series, you're probably thinking something like, \"'Emotionally fragile'? Bernie?\" Yes, she is. All is eventually explained.So, this is a fun mystery novel that, besides telling a packed story, also advances our understanding of Bernie and Chee. And of course, as always, of the Din\u00e9!",

                "reviewText": "I first began reading Tony Hillerman because of his focus on ceremonial and ritual aspects of Navajo civilization, such as The Blessing Way. I thought Anne Hillerman might be doing that with THE WAY OF THE BEAR.The novel is set in Utah\u2019s Bears Ears National Monument. Bernie goes there after being rejected for a position as a detective for the Navajo police. Its peaceful atmosphere makes her feel better until she discover evidence of illegal digging and vandalism of petroglyphs. While examining the destruction, she is chased and shot at by a black truck.Chee has come to Utah to meet with Dr. Chapman Dulles a paleontologist who has made a major discovery at Bears Ears. He\u2019s studying how mammals managed to survive and proliferate after an asteroid destroyed the dinosaurs. His discovery could be worth millions to museums or private collectors. Dulles wants to make a donation to the Navajo Police Department. Before Chee can meet with the doctor, people start to die, and the doctor goes into hiding.Some of the minor characters, mostly villains, need to be fleshed out. A researcher named Jessica loses her husband on the side of the road. She says he froze to death but eventually a bullet wound is found. She has a partner of sorts, Kinsley from the BLM. Both of them want the valuable fossil Dr. Dulles has found. They\u2019re willing to kill for it. There\u2019s a confrontation with Chee and Bernie.As in most of Anne Hillerman\u2019s novels, Bernie\u2019s mother and sister Darlene make an appearance. Surprisingly, Darlene wants to study to be a nurse and is taking care of their mother. She also has a steady boyfriend who wants to marry her.The gunplay starts when Dr. Dulles makes it known he intends to donate his find to a museum. He\u2019s only interested is in advancing knowledge. It\u2019s surprising that a ranger from the BLM and a anthropological researcher would be so greedy. And they\u2019re not the only ones.",

                "reviewText": "It's inevitable that a reader's first review of a Leaphorn, Chee and Manuelito book written by anyone other than Tony Hillerman be compared to his brilliant voice and lovingly-portrayed world. All I can say is that his daughter, Anne Hillerman, is a more than worthy successor and faithfully continues his voice, world, and beloved characters. She is a gripping storyteller and presents the Navajo landscape with as much passion, spirituality, and vividness as her father, and it's evident she has the same values and validates her stories with generous acknowledgements and the same meticulous research.This is the first of her Leaphorn, Chee and Manuelito books I have read, and I am happily looking forward to working my way through the others. If her other books in this series are as compelling and enjoyable as The Way of the Bear, they will join Tony Hillerman's in my All-time Favourite Books bookcase.",

Und beschlie\u00dft diese Reise als Erholung f\u00fcr Bernie zu nutzen.W\u00e4hrend sich Chee von der Anreise erholt, f\u00e4hrt Bernie zum Monument um dort den Sonnenuntergang zu genie\u00dfen und die Petroglyhen zu studieren, die aber traurigerweise Vandalismus erfahren haben. Und kurz darauf wird Bernie fast \u00fcber den Haufen gefahren - und auch noch beschossen. Und sp\u00e4ter in der Nacht muss sie auch noch am Stra\u00dfenrand bei einer Geburt assistieren. Eine langer Ferientagebucheintrag.Als am n\u00e4chsten Tag auch noch eine Leiche gefunden wird, ist es mit der Erholung endg\u00fcltig vorbei und Bernie und Chee werden in die Wirren und Irrungen der Pal\u00e4ontologie, Fr\u00fchgeschichte und damit verbundene Verbrechen und Verordnungen hineingezogen.Viel Hintergrundswissen mit den allvertrauten Hauptcharakteren - wenn auch stellenweise ein wenig zu ausgedehnt - unter anderem durch Informationsdopplungen.",
