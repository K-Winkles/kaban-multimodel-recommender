                "reviewText": "I\u2019m not going to say that the multiple story lines are boring, but none are as compelling as those found in the earlier books. Reacher himself is a bit less of himself than usual. Not only is there a reduction in the trivia and arcane information that he is prone to give us, he is also a little too efficient in following the trail he\u2019s become curious about. He also has minimal contact with both police or bad guys.The book passed the time reasonably well but unlike many of the other books I doubt that I\u2019ll get around to reading this one again.",

                "reviewText": "I had higher hopes for the Child (Grant) brothers collaboration after the last novel, \"Better Off Dead,\" felt like a big step in the right direction after \"The Sentinel\" was a relative flop. This was better than that effort, but still nothing like what we've come to expect from Reacher thrillers. Sure, there's mystery and even a relatively topical plot that's finally uncovered very late in the story, but the action was very limited and Reacher almost seems neutered. He's nowhere near as ruthless as he used to be, though one of his antagonist kills is one of the most brutal I remember of the series. I also didn't really understand the point of the supporting character who isn't necessarily bad, but doesn't end up really bringing anything to the plot. Maybe he's supposed to be some kind of younger parallel for Reacher, but it just didn't work in my eyes. I'll still read \"The Secret,\" but my hopes for these new novels are really starting to dwindle. Andrew isn't a bad writer, but these books just haven't been exciting for more than just a few pages here and there.",
