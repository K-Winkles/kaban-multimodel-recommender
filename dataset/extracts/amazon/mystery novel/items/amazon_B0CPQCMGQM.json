Author Emily Organ brings us another thoroughly enjoyable and intriguing mystery.This book kept me interested all the way to the end. I did not guess the culprit, and was misled a number of times. We continue to find out more about Augusta and Philip's wartime intelligence work, and more of Scotland Yard begin relying on Augusta's investigative and deductive skills. However, as usual, she is so busy during a case that she doesn't get many old books repaired. It's a good thing she has Fred for an employee, who also provides her with some clues! As always, moral support by Sparky the canary!I really like Emily's books because they contain interesting facts about London at that time woven into the plot. She does good historical research for each book. Highly recommended!",

Here Augusta is the first to notice the body of a woman reporter floating in a boat on the Thames and is naturally interested in her story. Was it something to do with her job or something personal that led to her murder? The customary characters lend their support as Augusta and Philip investigate. The solution is unexpected if not particularly clever, but it ties up the threads nicely.I would recommend this book to all cozy lovers. The series presents good, light-hearted reads with more of Augusta's background yet to be revealed. I am looking forward to the next one.",

                "reviewText": "Murder on the Thames is the sixth book in the Augusta Peel 1920s Mystery series by Emily Organ. It takes place after World War I and from previous books in this series we know that Augusta worked for British Intelligence during the war. In this story, while on a boating excursion on the Thames with her very chatty cousin, Augusta spots an unmanned boat adrift and some dark hair under a tarp on the boat. Not surprisingly once the police are summoned, they find the body of a woman under the tarp. Augusta feels the need to get involved in the search for the killer, since she is the one who spotted the body, but especially since the lead detective assigned to the case is the incompetent son of the Commissioner of Scotland Yard. Thankfully her friend Philip, formerly a Detective Inspector with Scotland Yard, and with whom Augusta worked during the war, has opened a private detective agency in her building, and he and Augusta go to work to find out what happened, although Philip does get sidetracked at times with a woman whose husband is missing.In each book, we are given more clues about Augusta's time during the war, and this book gives several - all while giving us red herrings and rabbit holes to fall down till the surprising ending is revealed. I am pretty good at figuring out the murderer in most books, but I was completely stumped on this one.This is a fast paced, well thought out and researched story, and I could not put this book down! I can hardly wait for the next one.",

                "reviewText": "Augusta Peel is on a sightseeing boat on the Thames with a friend when she sees a body under a cover on an abandoned boat. Not one to let this go, she decides to investigate.Once again Augusta proves she is smarter and more persistent than Scotland Yard detectives. even more than her friend Philip Fisher who is now a private detective after leaving Scotland Yard.We keep hoping but so far there seems to be no romantic connection on Philip's end but he does like being close to Augusta since he now rents an office above her used bookstore. He also still likes collaborating with her as they do again on this case. It seems Scotland Yard acknowledges they need help since the Commissioner put his inexperienced and lazy son in as Detective Inspector.I enjoy this series and love the main characters. Reading them in order enhances the fun of the series and natural progression of the relationship of the characters who met during the war and worked together for British Intelligence.The murder is solved but not without dangerous situations and more crimes being committed. Augusta Peel is a brave and smart woman. We end with a cliffhanger and a villain who will be heard from again. Looking forward to the next installment of the Augusta Peel detective series by Emily Organ.",

What the description doesn't tell you is that as a mystery book, the clues left are flawless, characters are real, some devious, some decent, others simply broken. The story ends with a twist and leaves knowing there is more adventure and mystery for Augusta Peel and Mr Fischer to navigate both at an emotional, physical and spiritual level.
