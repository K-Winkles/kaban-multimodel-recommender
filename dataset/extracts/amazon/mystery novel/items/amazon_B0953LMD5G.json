His saving grace was always his determination to see things through and his caring about victims and their families. This story shows his generosity as well as that same caring and dedication to doing right by those families and it brought me to tears several times throughout. I love how Beau has developed into a far better man than he was in his youth and eagerly await the next J P Beaumont book.",
