This new and entertaining collection by some of our favorite writers will hook a new group of readers to the formidable Miss Marple.\" \u2014 Rhys Bowen, Washington Post\u201cMarple is the best loved [detective]. Also the most influential. . . . It is Miss Marple who introduced the revolutionary notion that people are essentially the same wherever one goes.\u201d \u2014 Los Angeles TimesAgatha Christie\u2019s legendary sleuth, Jane Marple, returns to solve twelve baffling cases in this brand-new collection, penned by a host of acclaimed authors skilled in the fine art of mystery and murderOne doesn't stop at one murder...Jane Marple is an elderly lady from St Mary Mead who possesses an uncanny knack for solving even the most perplexing puzzles. Now, for the first time in 45 years, Agatha Christie\u2019s beloved character returns to the page for a globe-trotting tour of crime and detection.Join Marple as she travels through her sleepy English village and around the world. In St Mary Mead, a Christmas dinner is interrupted by unexpected guests; the Broadway stage in New York City is set for a dangerous improvisation; bad omens surround an untimely death aboard a cruise ship to Hong Kong; and a bestselling writer on holiday in Italy is caught in a nefarious plot. These and other crimes committed in the name of love, jealousy, blackmail, and revenge are ones that only the indomitable Jane Marple can solve.Bringing a fresh twist to the hallmarks of a classic Agatha Christie mystery, these twelve esteemed writers have captured the sharp wit, unique voice, and droll ingenuity of the deceptively demure detective. A triumphant celebration of Christie\u2019s legacy and essential reading for crime lovers, Marple is a timely reminder why Jane Marple remains one of the most famous detectives of all time.

                "reviewText": "While lovers of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple may welcome an opportunity to revisit her in some new tales of deduction, these efforts cannot be said to quite capture the essence of the original.The stories vary in terms of the timeframe that they choose for Miss Marple, most setting her in a time far beyond that of even her last story (\"Sleeping Murder\"), and thus in frailer health. In addition, most try to move her out to realms far from St. Mary Mead and its environs -- some more successfully than others. Mostly, however, I felt that these are not stories I will ever want to reread. For a taste of Miss Marple, I will simply return to the original books and short stories that I first read over 55 years ago and continue to enjoy with each re-encounter.Of course, capturing all the characteristics of Miss Marple mysteries in the condensed format of a short story is difficult. But too often I felt as if those details that we associate with Miss Marple were superficially applied rather than integral to the story. The village parallels in these stories -- so important to Miss Marple's deductions -- especially felt rather weak. I would guess that if you are at all like me, you may appreciate these stories as efforts, but not be charmed by them as by the originals.",

Dolly Bantry was too proper and too smart to put herself in that position. Before making the unnamed effort to help Genivieve, she would have confided in Miss Marple for advice on what to do, write a telegram and arrange a call. In all the original Marple stories,that's what Dolly did--she'd summon Jane from wherever and pour her guts out.Also, Miss Marple would NEVER consent to how it ended. This author really did not understand the assignment at all. I wish I could ask back for the fraction of the money for that last story, but it's pure trash and worth nothing. It had a decent start and I was happy to see Dolly again but whew, that ending was hot garbage.Other than that, most of the stories were entertaining and stuck to Marple canon.",

Se nota que estos han le\u00eddo las novelas de Miss Marple y tienes la sensaci\u00f3n de que vuelves a leer nuevos casos de la spinster de St. Mary Mead. El libro que comento es la versi\u00f3n inglesa de bolsillo. Me lleg\u00f3 en un casi perfecto estado. Totalmente recomendable",
