I've read them twice now, and I am sure that in another year or two I will want to read them again.

He was working on going north only to find a big problem. His innocence causes him problems as he tries at a tilt. He looses his equipment to ransom because of his inability to handle the lance as well as he does his sword. The political world the seven kingdoms has so many real world parallels. Showing George's obsession with history. I love how he brings the world of Westeros to his audience in so many mediums. The comic book is a great medium for his stories.",

                "reviewText": "The graphic novel adaptation of the third of George R.R. Martin\u2019s Dunk & Egg novellas not only stays true to the original story while also giving it a new dimension with fantastic renderings of all the characters, the locales, and the action. Drawn by artist Mike S. Miller based on the adaptation by Ben Avery, The Mystery Knight immediately builds upon the previous adventure of Ser Duncan (Dunk) the Tall and the future Aegon (Egg) V as they stumble upon conspiracy from an enemy from across the sea.Avery adaptation and Miller\u2019s art effectively brings the novella to life though to be honest some of the character designs while not off-putting or interesting, particularly a character that is attempting to kill Dunk due to jealousy. The appearance of the often-mentioned Lord Bloodraven is particularly amazing, not only the character\u2019s artwork but the double page appearance with him front and center. There was a small change in the order of the story, but it worked well in the flow of the graphic novel and didn\u2019t affect the overall work. The graphic novel adaptation of The Mystery Knight is something every A Song of Ice and Fire fan should get their hands on.",

                "reviewText": "CAVEAT: This is a Kindle Edition Review, which considers the story and the medium with separate standards.Story: This is a graphic adaptation of the GRRM short story \"The Mystery Knight,\" which builds more backstory into \"A Song of Ice and Fire.\" If you're new to the series, you should start with \"The Hedge Knight.\"In this story, Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire Egg are making their way north across the Riverlands when they decide to join the festivities of wealthy Lord Butterwell's wedding. There will be a feast and a jousting tourney, with Lord Butterwell's dragon egg as the prize. Duncan tries out some privileges of knighthood for himself and finds them a mixed bag, just as his old master Ser Arlan warned him. Egg, with his eye for social subtleties, senses the political elephant in the castle before Duncan. The knights, the lordly Houses and the exercise of power and symbolism are all themes we get another perspective on, building on the work of \"The Hedge Knight,\" \"The Sworn Sword,\" and other ASOIAF titles.My only quibble with the story, as told, is two lines lost in translation from the short story. At the campfire by the lake, after Ser Kyle tells the salacious story of where Butterwell's dragon egg came from, Dunc makes the quip that \"If half those old stories were true, we'd all be bastard sons of old King Aegon.\" Ser Maynard Plumm ripostes \"Who says we aren't?!\"Medium: Like Adam Charlton notes in his review, many panels could stand some more zoom. You can't magnify the text or the action and read these beautiful panels like you can in the Kindle GN edition of \"The Hedge Knight,\" \"The Sworn Sword,\" or \"Meathouse Man,\" other GRRM graphic adaptions I own. 3 screenshots are attached I hope that if the novel is reformatted, kindle owners will be alerted.",
