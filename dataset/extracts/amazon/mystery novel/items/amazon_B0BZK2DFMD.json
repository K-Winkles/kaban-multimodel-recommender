As she digs deeper, it becomes clear that plenty of people had reason to want Paul gone. Both his work and home life were rife with long-held grudges\u2026 was one of Paul\u2019s trusted friends actually his murderer?Then, Grace\u2019s search takes a frightening turn when another body is found \u2013 this time in the changing rooms of the posh local golf club.Uncovering a shocking secret linking the two deaths, Grace finds her professional and personal boundaries beginning to blur.

From then, I read as fast as I could especially since Jackie Baldwin\u2019s storyline moves quickly and seamlessly. The story never dragged or stalled in endless contemplation or dialogue. I love short chapters and she delivered! Being set in Scotland, I love learning about their culture, the phrases they use that are so different than Americans. Her cast of characters are likable or not, just as I assume she envisioned. This is a cozy, quick read that I loved devouring in just a few sittings. Luckily, I have her next book to dive into! I can\u2019t wait since Baldwin left me a bit emotional at the end, having to take a moment to respect and love how she crafted the story.",

                "reviewText": "This was an interesting mystery and kind of touched on a lot of different elements. Where should I start? Ok, we have Grace who was kicked off/quit the police force after the tragic death of her teenage son. She separated from her husband (as most often happens after the death of a child) and started a detective/P.I. agency in Edinburgh. Eventually Grace gets a case to solve the murder of a psychic who committed apparent suicide, but his widow thinks otherwise. This leads the whole team (of 3) at the detective agency into dangerous paths. More and more bad things happen as Grace infiltrates the Psychic college and her team infiltrates other areas. Dead bodies, theft at a country club, kidnapped babies, kidnapped adults, and dealing with the otherworldly via the mediums at the psychic college.Fun fact, psychic colleges are real. I thought it was a made up thing for the book, it\u2019s not I googled it and there are real colleges out there for psychics and metaphysical studies which is interesting. This story has a lot of elements. The obvious one is the murder mystery, then we have the mother who is unable to move on from the death of her son and the murder case really brings that grief to the forefront. There are sections in the story that felt very repetitive, which may be because the case was going in circles but reading the same things multiple times, is not that fun for the reader.The narrator did a great job, the voices were not that different, but it was easy to follow along and she was able to convey the emotions of the scenes.This is a fun mystery with a touch of paranormal type elements (with the mediums). It is nice to read a story set in Edinburgh even if everyone is dying.I received this book for free from Netgalley and Dreamscape Media",

I liked the office of three women working together and that she was still on good terms with her soon to be ex-husband. I think that the author did an excellent job with her characterizations and it was a good solid plot. I definitely recommend this book for lovers of Murder Mysteries and especially those that are set in the British Isles. I look forward to book 2.",

                "reviewText": "I really enjoyed the D.I. Frank Farrell series that Jackie Baldwin has written and so when I saw that she\u2019d written a new series featuring a female detective, Grace McKenna, I decided to give it a try. I\u2019m happy to say that I wasn\u2019t disappointed. Grace McKenna is a very different character from Frank Farrell and with it being set in a Private Eye Agency it is not the standard cosy crime police procedural.Grace McKenna has had the worst possible year that anyone could experience, her son apparently took his own life, her marriage has broken down and she has left the police force to set up a private eye agency. Her two staff, Hannah and Jean are new to detective work and so Grace is also having to train them as well as work a very difficult and time-consuming case. At times the pressure and stress become almost overwhelming for her and her staff, but they persevere.I won\u2019t give the plot away, but there are a number of twists and turns and more than one suspect. I liked the novel immensely and found it engrossing and one that I couldn\u2019t put down. It gave a new angle on solving a crime, with at times rather unorthodox methods, that Grace hopefully wouldn\u2019t have been able to use in her previous career in the police. Well done Jackie Baldwin and I look forward to reading the next novel in the series, Murder at Castle Traprain, which I believe is coming out in September 2023.",

I loved Harvey, the dog and his vital part in all the proceedings.The main character was seriously assaulted in the line of the investigation but no mention of police following this up and she recovered \"too well\" and just got on with her work which was an unrealistic expectation.Also interesting because I viewed a top floor flat overlooking Portobello beach many years ago but never bought.I did guess the murderer early on but not the reason and intrigued how they were going to catch the person. Hence 4 stars.Looking forward to reading more books by Jackie Baldwin",

Grace McKenna, her dog Harvey and two women sidekicks make a fabulous team.Grace is hired by a local resident to investigate the death of her husband. But all is not as it seems in this quiet seaside town. A young girl is murdered at a golf club and the local Psychic Development College comes under suspicion.It\u2019s a super cosy mystery, best read on a Sunday afternoon with tea and biscuits. The setting, Portobello, could become the next Midsomer.. The characters, particularly Grace and her sleuthing team, shine off the page. It will keep you guessing to the very last page. There\u2019s a real shock there too! I\u2019m already looking forward to reading the next book.",
