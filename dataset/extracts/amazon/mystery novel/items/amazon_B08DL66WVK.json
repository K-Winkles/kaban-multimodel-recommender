        "description": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER REESE\u2019S BOOK CLUB PICK \u201cDelightful . . . [a] captivating and slyly subversive fictional paean to the real women whose work on the Oxford English Dictionary went largely unheralded.\u201d\u2014The New York Times Book Review \u201cA marvelous fiction about the power of language to elevate or repress.\u201d\u2014Geraldine Brooks, New York Times bestselling author of People of the BookEsme is born into a world of words. Motherless and irrepressibly curious, she spends her childhood in the Scriptorium, an Oxford garden shed in which her father and a team of dedicated lexicographers are collecting words for the very first Oxford English Dictionary. Young Esme\u2019s place is beneath the sorting table, unseen and unheard. One day a slip of paper containing the word bondmaid flutters beneath the table. She rescues the slip and, learning that the word means \u201cslave girl,\u201d begins to collect other words that have been discarded or neglected by the dictionary men.As she grows up, Esme realizes that words and meanings relating to women\u2019s and common folks\u2019 experiences often go unrecorded. And so she begins in earnest to search out words for her own dictionary: the Dictionary of Lost Words. To do so she must leave the sheltered world of the university and venture out to meet the people whose words will fill those pages.Set during the height of the women\u2019s suffrage movement and with the Great War looming, The Dictionary of Lost Words reveals a lost narrative, hidden between the lines of a history written by men. Inspired by actual events, author Pip Williams has delved into the archives of the Oxford English Dictionary to tell this highly original story. The Dictionary of Lost Words is a delightful, lyrical, and deeply thought-provoking celebration of words and the power of language to shape the world.WINNER OF THE AUSTRALIAN BOOK INDUSTRY AWARD Read more",

                "reviewText": "Interesting: Like many who read this novel, I love words, their meanings, and their origins. I don\u2019t geek out per se, but when an interesting word pops up on my daily \u201cA Word A Day\u201d email, I save it and add it to my vocabulary flash cards in the hopes of being able to work it into conversation(s) down the road. Ms. Williams\u2019 novel provided me with many insights into the process behind the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) by weaving an endearing story around the people (both real and imagined) who make it (literally) their life\u2019s work. That said, the real takeaway for me was the revelation that there is gender bias built into the definitions of the words that comprise our English language, and that bias comes about intentionally in the way the definitions and usages themselves are created, and which words are or aren\u2019t allowed into the dictionary. The novel\u2019s parallel story lines of the creation of the OED and the women\u2019s suffrage movement of early 1900\u2019s England provide the perfect confluence of events to serve as the backdrop for this novel, bearing witness to both struggles. As the historical clock ticks upward toward the arc of the First World War, a third story line arrives on the scene to deliver further difficulties and liberal doses of heartache. In the final analysis, there is triumph on all fronts, but also there is a price to be paid.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m having a difficult time trying to put into words what I thought of this historical novel.On one hand the historical background of the lexicographers of the first Oxford English Dictionary is fascinating with a story interwoven into the narrative to bring the history alive.However, I found the writing to be somewhat vague and confusing. One example is when the main character, Esme, writes to her aunt (or is she a godmother?), Ditte.Esme will state that she needs to write to Ditte but we don\u2019t see that letter, only the response from the aunt.We learn very little of Esme\u2019s time at primary school or the boarding school to which she was sent in Scotland. Therefore, we know little of what is in Esme\u2019s heart and soul.A feminist in every sense of the word, she makes an unfortunate decision that turns out to be very fortuitous at the conclusion of the book, albeit somewhat unbelievable.Esme does marry but we hear nothing of her husband in the ending either.I was disappointed at the author\u2019s choice of words for inclusion in the dictionary from the \u201ccommon\u201d people, which made them look \u201cdirty.\u201dI can\u2019t recommend this book.",

The women's suffrage movement and WWI serve as historical markers, along with the work of compiling the first Oxford dictionary. Essie has a fairly simple life, but the complications of that ease become more evident as she ages in her changing world.Historical reads aren't my preferred novels, but this one was okay. My heart broke over and over for Essie with each trial she faced. So much loss made this a difficult book to read. I did enjoy the dissection of words and meaning. The lighthearted discussions with \"dirty\" words and the empowering commentary on womanhood and equality were highlights in a book that carries a heavy heart.",
