The Abbey just sounded so sumptuous and I was imagining what a great to have in my hometown. Eve certainly doesn't need to go far for murder to land in her lap. The plots and characters are so well thought out and defined that nothing about the story felt contrived. I really enjoyed this book as much as the previous books. Sometimes Authors of long series begin to have their characters wear thin or become just tired. Not in this case. The writing is still fresh and thoughtful. Now I'm going to go brew up spot of Yorkshire tea and have an English muffin with some lovely marmalade and settle down on the couch with my Dachshund \"Albert\" as we start the next book. What a treat. I highly recommend this series if you love a wholesome, escape to the British countryside with an Obituary writing, part time baker and murder investigator! What a great and interesting basis for a protagonist. You won't be disappointed.",

                "reviewTitle": "Hugely enjoyable and most accomplished novel in the series so far",
                "reviewText": "In this hugely enjoyable outing for obituary writer turned sleuth, Eve Mallow, she\u2019s won a stay at the classy Abbey Hotel. She immediately takes to the owner, Debra Moran, who has a very clear vision for the future. Unfortunately, someone kills her in the woods that night, bringing the police to the hotel to investigate.As Eve collects details for an obituary and her own investigation, a second murder shocks the peaceful Suffolk countryside.With a large number of suspects and motives, it\u2019s slow progress. Gardener and former police officer Robin is on hand to pass information both ways as the investigation deepens, bringing Eve closer and closer to the killer, who may have little choice but to silence her.With such a wide choice of suspects, the mystery takes some sorting out, and remains intriguing until Eve finally slots the pieces together for a tense, nail biting climax.Like the previous novels in the series, Eve and dachshund Gus are a formidable pair. Fellow villagers follow her progress with interest, often chipping in with useful details and gossip. The characters and relationships bring a warm glow this cosy mystery, adding humour and interest at every stage.While the book works fine as a standalone, it\u2019s more fun and much more interesting to follow Eve and her fellow villagers through the series, getting to know them like old friends. The series gets better and better and this story is the most accomplished and satisfying to date.Looking forward to the next in the series.",
