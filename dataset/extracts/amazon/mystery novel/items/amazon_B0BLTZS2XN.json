Based on the byline \u201cCharlie\u201d James and the assumption that Charlie is a man she is hired by the Paris Times newspaper. Determined to prove that she is the best journalist possible and better than any of her male counterparts, Charlie\u2019s first assignment is to cover British expatriate and Socialite Lady Ashworth\u2019s extravagant Circus Ball. Charlie hopes that at the very least she\u2019ll be sure to make connections with the most interesting and exciting upper crust of society. Festivities come to a halt when an influential and detestable banking investor is murdered. Charlie finds herself a part of solving the mystery. Who would be so bold as to murder someone at such a high profile event? As she becomes involved in covering the story, Charlie becomes part of the Paris scene. For me, I found an extraordinary amount of unnecessary details that detracted from the story line. Do I really need to know or care that a hanky tucked into a sleeve is blue? Secrets unravel and suspects are many. There\u2019s an unexpected twist and for that reason I\u2019ve given this \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f 1/2 rounded up to four.",

                "reviewText": "Charlotte \u201cCharlie\u201d James arrives in 1938 Paris from Australia ready to start her dream job of reporting for The Times, and needing to impress her new British boss, but what is she hiding in her past? The Paris Mystery by Kirsty Manning is a fast-paced, intriguing story of a woman determined to find her place and establish herself in a world she is not quite a part of. Charlie is quickly immersed in a world of fancy parties, elegant design houses, and scandalous relationships, and she adapts well. She is determined to get the real story behind the murder of a shady investor, murdered at The Circus Ball, THE event of the season. She will have to rely on others to find the truth, regardless if she can trust them or not.Manning is brilliant at setting the stage and creating the glitzy world of booze, broads, balls, and brutes. You really feel that you are in the fabulous cafes and mansions of 1930s Paris. Manning creates a smart, sophisticated character in Charlie, and you are immediately rooting for her to prove her sexist boss wrong!Charlie\u2019s past is slowly revealed and once done, it makes perfect sense for the character that we know in Paris. And it adds a layer of complexity to the story.The mystery twists and turns and the ending is quite satisfying. And the fact that this should be a series of books (following Charlie\u2019s adventures) is an added bonus. Charlie is just that kind of spunky, saucy heroine you want to read more about.Great writing, lovely setting, and a main character you want to spend more time with after the book is over- all adds up to a 4/5 on the random rating scale.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Fun book!",
                "reviewText": "In 1938 Paris, the fashion scene is in full swing, along with fancy dinner parties thrown by elite members of society. Yes, I\u2019m such a fashion outcast that I had to look up most of the fashion words in the dictionary. Haha! My regular fashion words such as tshirt and jeans didn\u2019t quite make the Paris fashion scene if you can believe it!I wish I could attend their fancy parties, though! Ms. Manning\u2019s descriptions of the circus masquerade party thrown by the Ashworths make you feel as if you are right there. The details she carefully crafts about the sights, sounds, and smells put you right in the middle of the action. The trainer leading the tiger around like a puppy, the India maharajas arriving on elephants, the white doves, and the black swans. The jugglers, the acrobats, and the fairy lights.Guests with masks and designer dresses wander the grounds and hobnob with the important people. Those important people make up many characters in this book. These characters make the book. They\u2019re well written, unique, diverse, and so fun! I love Violet\u2019s fashion and Lady Ashworth\u2019s extravagance. Charlie is down-to-earth, yet elegant and sophisticated. She\u2019s relatable and comes across as authentic. The relationships between the characters are also well written and help bring the story to life.There are many twists and turns to this book, and it definitely kept me guessing! It\u2019s entertaining and so fun. I enjoyed my time in 1938 Paris, for sure! I may not fit in wearing my tshirt and jeans, but a girl can dream! This book has a little bit of everything with some romance, mystery, murder, high fashion, fancy masquerade parties, deception, loyalty, and betrayal.Content Rating: PG-13+\u2022 Profanity: None\u2022 Intimacy: Moderate (There are a couple of scenes, including a \u201cself-pleasure\u201d scene, and some innuendos. They aren\u2019t too detailed or explicit.)\u2022 Violence: Moderate (There is a murder with a bloody weapon, and another character dies a very unsettling death.)",
