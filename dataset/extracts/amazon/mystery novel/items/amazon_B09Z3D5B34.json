                "reviewText": "An intricate thriller set in mythical Three Pines, Quebec.In the 18th Inspector Armand Gamache mystery, Louise Penny provides a clever plotline, where one mystery segues into another. \u201cA World of Curiosities\u201d begins with a flashback, where Inspector Gamache investigated the death of a female drug addict and uncovered horrendous child abuse and pornography. A decade later, the addict\u2019s damaged children, Fiona and Sam Arsenault, reappear in Three Pines. In a seemingly unrelated incident, the Three Pines residents discover a hidden room containing a bizarre copy of a 17th century painting, the Paston Treasure. As Gamache studies the painting, he realizes that it contains messages directed to him by the serial killer John Fleming.\u201cA World of Curiosities\u201d is well-written literary fiction. The novel affords Louise Penny the opportunity to reflect on good and evil, and how brave men and women move forward in tragic circumstances. It\u2019s dark but worthwhile.As with other books in the Gamache series, \u201cA World of Curiosities\u201d assumes previous knowledge of the Three Pines residents. The plot is elaborate \u2013 how often does one read a novel containing two psychopaths?In the last ten years there\u2019s been a trend for thriller writers to feature a villain who is the worst person in their country\u2019s history. This was the case in The Girl in the Eagle\u2019s Talons, the latest Lisbeth Salander novel, where she must deal with the deadly Marcus Branco. In \u201cA World of Curiosities\u201d Inspector Gamache must deal with John Fleming, Canada\u2019s worst villain. It doesn\u2019t make sense that Fleming takes up residence in Three Pines and Gamache fails to recognize him.An enjoyable dark thriller with flaws.",
