Overall I enjoyed this bookThe issues I had are as follows; This book was confusing - maybe this was just a problem specific to me but some of the details and the way it was written made this hard to follow at times. The characters were challenging to keep track of, partly because there were so many, and partly because so many weren't of great importance. It was slow to start, I wasn't fully absorbed and committed until around the halfway point.Like I said at the beginning, the book was good overall, and I may read the next book that this author puts out.",

Our lead character is witty and clever enough to be a likable protagonist but not necessarily smart enough to solve the mystery in the first five minutes. I also like how he keeps reminding the reader that it\u2019s too early to have revealed who the killer is. Speaking of which the reveal is good and slightly unexpected. I think you\u2019ll have a fun time figuring out which of these killers is the killer. 5/5",

                "reviewText": "\"Everyone in my family has killed someone. Some of us, the high achievers, have killed more than once.\"The title of this book certainly got my attention. Knowing nothing except the title, I dove in expecting a great murder mystery or, at least, a humorous one. In the end it was a little of both.The story is set at a ski resort in Australia during a severe snow storm where the Cunningham family is holding their family reunion. Although each person has his or her secrets, most of the family is aware of the dirty backgrounds of the relatives. The story is told in the first person by Ernest Cunningham who is himself an author, his specialty is in writing books on \u201chow to write books\u201d. He also serves as a self-appointed family historian as he sets the stage for the story and explains each of the characters and their many foibles. There were many asides in the story when Ernest speaks directly to the reader, often adding more confusion. Finally, Ernest is also the Sleuth of the story.Unfortunately the book moved fairly slowly and was overly complicated due to the sheer number of family members, plus non-family characters, that the reader needed to keep track of. The story offers a unique take on a murder mystery, unfortunately, the plot and back stories were excessively complicated which, at times, made the story more confusing than fun. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",
