                "reviewText": "I can\u2019t remember where I heard about this series but put the first book on hold at the library and forgot about it until I was notified I could check it out. After the first few chapters, I went back and reserved the rest of the series. A few more chapters in, I bought the series knowing I would want to come back and revisit these characters. I am usually someone who likes to push thru and read a book that hooks me thru in one sitting, but I would intentionally lay the book down and walk away so I could enjoy it more later. At times I would forget it was a book I was reading and not a series I was watching on Britbox or Acorn as I had cast all the Thursday Murder Club with various people from my favorite British mysteries.Right then, enough gushing - The first book in the series The Thursday Murder Club introduces us to Elizabeth, Joyce, Ron & Ibrahim. All pensioners who have retired to a village manufactured specifically for retirees. Set on the land of died out convent, Cooper\u2019s Chase, our four lead characters do not simply putter around and wait for the end to come. They have formed a club in which they look into the unsolved cases of a founding member of the club, Penny, who is now bed ridden with dementia. The four bring their life experience to play as they work out the cases when an actual murder takes place and giddy with possibilities, the group decide to help out the local constabulary.The police officers Chris and Donna don\u2019t have the formulaic response to this assistance - they are bemused, a bit annoyed but receptive and then succumb to the group\u2019s charm and guile and form a lovely partnership of sorts.Delightful is honestly the word that comes to mind for this book and series start. The characters are well written, I look forward to further development and finding out who from the first book continues on in the series as secondary characters. Each brings their life experience with them and understanding that time is fleeting and they are invisible in a way at their ages - not taken as threats, catching people off guard with their directness.A TV series/movie is forthcoming and it will be interesting to see if it keeps the integrity of the characters or if it waters them down for tongue in cheek humor of geriatric amateur sleuths erasing the nuances of these people gaining a second life after leaving careers, children, losing spouses or dealing with sick spouses. The club allows them to thrive with their peers.",

                "reviewText": "This is a 4.5 for me instead of a 5 for two reasons. First is that I wouldn\u2019t have really delved into it past the third chapter if, after shelving it for a year, finding it a bit dull and weird, a good friend of mine hadn\u2019t said it was fantastic. And second, I found one of the twists in it didn\u2019t quite make sense to me. I won\u2019t say what it is but it did just take a bit of the gloss off it. There was also a few pages where I was very much afraid that one of my favorite characters in the book was going to turn out to be a murderer. I would have been devastated but, no, it was okay. Whew! Something like that made me want to smack Richard Osman for worrying me so much :)Otherwise, I loved it this time around. Especially as I was also listening to it on Audible and Lesley Manville\u2019s narration is superb. Just the right amount of British humor in the voice that you know what\u2019s actually behind what she\u2019s saying.My perspective is as someone who is almost the age of the main characters and who also lives in a retirement community. One that is without the cemetery or English location sadly but, still, I got right into the flow of the characters. And now I am going to go see how much the next one is or whether it\u2019s available at the library\u2026.",

The style, with very short chapters (some as short as one page) and periodic first person narrative is rather unusual, but I found it absorbing and I cared about the characters. (Caution: my sister and my wife didn't care for the style and couldn't finish it). The author is a popular TV quiz show host in the UK and I like those programs too!",

                "reviewText": "Four pensioners, all living in the same retirement home, have formed a tight friendship group. With varying backgrounds they each bring different knowledge from their previous lives, yet the one thing Elizabeth, Joyce, John and Ibrahim can all relate to are the challenges of being old. Although there are many group activities available at the Coopers Chase Retirement Village, these 4 have formed their own group which they have dubbed \u201cThe Thursday Murder Club\u201d. The reason for the unusual title is their joint delight in reviewing old, unsolved murder cases (one of the members had access to these files prior to retiring) and discussing how to solve them.Things take a dramatically different turn when a local property developer, one who was involved in the creation of their own retirement village, is murdered in his home. Now the Thursday Murder Club has a real case to solve. Their biggest challenge is inserting themselves into the official police investigation, both in order to obtain information that the Club needs and so that the Club can help the police by sharing what they have uncovered.A very quick read, the chapters are short ( there are over 100 of them!) yet, at times, the story falls all over itself with it\u2019s abundance of details - many of which could have been omitted. A good editor would have tightened the story and enhanced it even further. Still, it is a fun read with a plenty of twists and turns as every good crime mystery should have. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f",

Takes place in a retirement village which sounds very idyllic compared to the reality of most of them. The plot has many twists and turns and seems to have many paths thrown in to add to the word count of the book. Reads like a made for TV series - perhaps that is what the author wanted. I may read the next one. It\u2019s well written but confusing at first - takes awhile to get to where the story is supposed to go. I\u2019d give it a C+ - I finished it. We read it for Book Club and mostly had positive reviews. It\u2019s not great lit but entertaining. Could be shorter - in need of better editing.",
