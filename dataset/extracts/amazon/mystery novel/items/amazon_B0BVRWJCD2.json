How can it be that the medical examiner had the same mark from her ex husband from years ago? Surely not, it has been so long. But then another body, another mark, the same mark\u2026er brand, yes a cattle brand. Someone is trying to send a message. Josie now has to visit the small, corrupt city that Anya left behind and connect the cases to solve the new ones. I have to admit this book was emotional to say the least and I might have cried. But as always, I definitely recommend this one and all of the Josie Quinn series",

I honestly suspected everyone and yet wasn\u2019t really sure who was guilty as the story unfolded. This might be the most well written installment in the series so far. Not just the mystery but the team and how they work together. I\u2019ll definitely be thinking about this one for a long time to come.",

I also love when she delves into the backstory of one of the characters we have come to know. This time it was Anya, the medical examiner.This book had multiple puzzles, murders from different times and places, that are connected. But Josie's crew (work and family) ferret out all the clues and when the pieces are put together, the reveal is a surprise. I will admit the multiple murders and all the various character names had me confused from time to time. Just a little trouble holding all of those names in my mind at the same time.I also have to admit this one made me cry...more than once. But...looking forward to #18.",

                "reviewText": "I just have to tell you that this book was more than what I expected. I knew that it would be a good mystery, a great crime procedural and include well-developed old friends from previous books in the series. What I was not prepared for was how absorbing the mystery was, how deeply developed the characters were and how detailed the police procedures were. I got to know the characters more in this book, because it\u2019s a deep dive into their hearts and souls. The plot is fast-paced and riveting, dealing with a serial killer who brands the victims and spreads them across several locations. Josie wants to find the person who killed young Sharon Eddy, especially for the sake of the woman\u2019s grandmother who raised her. When medical examiner Anya Feist gets involved personally in the crimes, the story becomes totally unputdownable and gut-wrenching at times. I enjoyed the story but I must say that this is the only Josie Quinn book that I have read that caused me to cry because of what happens. Tears of grief and outrage were real for me, and I credit the author for making me so close to the action and the characters that it was so real to me. I hated the culprits, pitied the victims and sobbed at one special scene that I can\u2019t go into because I don\u2019t want to give anything away. This is a book with all the feels and so real that I had trouble putting it down even after I finished it. Intriguing and addictive, this is the best of the best\u2026and Josie Quinn is the best!DisclaimerDisclosure of Material Connection: I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher via Netgalley.

                "reviewText": "I devoured this book. I didn't sleep much for two days while reading it because I couldn\u2019t put it down. But that's okay, I\u2019m not complaining! :)This book follows the medical examiner, Anya Feist, and reveals her story as an abuse survivor. Being an abuse survivor means living in constant fear that your past will come back and get you. Unfortunately, for Anya, that\u2019s exactly what happens.Lisa\u2019s descriptions of how abuse victims act and think are so on point that I was almost relieved. It was like validation, which I\u2019m sure has to do with how Anya reacted to abuse. Everyone reacts to trauma differently, but I feel like Anya reacted similarly to how I did, and that makes me feel a little less crazy if that makes any sense at all.The world knows Lisa Regan is an excellent writer, it's a proven fact, but this book, the detail, and the intricate plot are so masterfully mapped out that I was left in awe of her skill and ability to tell a story. I don't know how she keeps up with it all, and I'm so glad she can! It pulled me in so completely.Even when I had to put the book down to do other things, I was able to jump right back into the story without missing a beat. This book has an extreme amount of detail and A LOT of characters to keep up with. She did a freaking fantastic job with this one! I loved it! I hate that a favorite character was killed off (not telling and not spoiling!), but I understand why. With a series this long, things must be done to keep it fresh, and I believe Lisa has done that.This is another five-star, excellent page-turner from Lisa Regan. It\u2019s heart-stopping and, at times, so intense you\u2019ll be afraid to keep reading, but you\u2019ll also love every minute of it! I know I did!Just go get it, and you\u2019ll see what I\u2019m talking about!",
