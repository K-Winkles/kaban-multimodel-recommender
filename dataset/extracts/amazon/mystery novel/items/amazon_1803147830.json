There all several POV going on but you are still able to keep track and know when and with who things are taking place. Very well written and I would definitely buy more of her books. My ONE complaint is the binding was literally falling apart and I bougghy the book as new. Pages were falling out as I was reading. I guess that more about finding a better publisher than a ding on the author but it's very frustrating.",
