He's popular and his books have gained a large readership.He is (was) married to a most beautiful woman whom he adored and she reciprocated the feeling to him. But she had died and David is lost without her.Ten years pass and then, by chance, he sees a woman that could be his wifes double and from here on, David's life takes on new meaning. With a story as intriguing as a magicians secret.The premise is imaginative and twisted in such a way as to confuse and perplex the most astute reader. Mr Koontz gets a bit flowery at times filling up a paragraph with stunning verbal pictures , but then again, its sets the tone ( mostly thunder and lightning) that's most appropriate.A spine chilling and nail biting romp into a dark place inhabited by those who dare to call themselves \" human\". A bit scary?..yeah, but what were you expecting?",

                "reviewText": "My reviews of novels are always for an audience of one, the author. My stars and title should give any potential readers all they need to know regarding my thoughts on the book.Mr. Koontz, 60 is about 1 month in my future. My mother's influence made me an avid reader for as long as I can remember. Apparently, in the fifth grade I was reading at the college level. This only means that I stumbled on to your work early in my life. I can't say when, how old I was, or which of your novels I read first. I know it was well after I was part the Hardy Boys, and Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land. I do recall that at the time I believe I had already discovered Peter Straub and Stephen King enthralled me with his ability to bring characters to life. I can't be sure, but I think my first paperback of yours was, 'Lightning.' I was hooked, and yourself and Stephen King thrilled me novel after novel. While I'm a hard core SciFi reader, the best thrillers and horror novels satiate my reading appetite. Since I was able to retire at 54 I am able to devote as much time as I'd like to reading. If it weren't for Kindle Unlimited is I'd probably be broke and homeless, so I appreciate that some of your work can be accessed with my subscription. Never fear, I pay Fiat currency when I have to. I'm straying from what I intended to write.Whenever I would finish reading a Stephen King novel I would immediately want to try my hand at writing a novel. This isn't meant to take away from your work. When I finished a Dean Koontz novel I felt like I had just finished a 7 course meal at one of the finest eatery's in town. I cannot say the same for Mr. King. I eventually tried my hand at writing and self publishing, a hobby(?) I want to get back to. I reached out to you for advice and you actually replied. I know it may have been written by someone who works for you, but I believe it was really by your hand. That meant more than you could possibly realize. Damn, I'm straying again.What I initially intended to write about was how I've come to see your work as much more than fine dining. While most of my other favorite authors continue to deliver the goods in their fashion, your work is like following a good chef who is always trying to make an even more memorable meal every time they are in the kitchen. When I picked up the first of your novels I read there's no doubt it was great writing, but that's what it was, great writing. When I read your later work it's so much more than great writing, it's literature. I don't think I'd be wrong in assuming you strive to write at a level few others can ever reach. Novels are art, you deliver masterpieces. Your ability to make each word a burst of flavor and each sentence a meal is amazing. You write literature and I can only give that praise to a small handful of writers, dead or alive.Write on, dude!",
