                "reviewText": "I\u2019m honestly not sure if saying that \u201cI loved this book\u201d is the best way to put my reading experience.. Is it dark? Absolutely. Is it traumatic and disturbing? In true Karin Slaughter fashion, of course. But is it also so all consuming that you\u2019ll have a hard time putting it down? 100 percent.Personally, I find Karin Slaughter books to be somewhat therapeutic - as someone that has unfortunately dealt with SA and doesn\u2019t have it as a trigger when reading dark storylines. I cried when Charlie was explaining what SA truly takes from a person. I FELT that. Her detailing how she wanted to rid herself of everything inside her body that she felt was tainted by Zach, it\u2019s so real. I didn\u2019t even realize it at first, but I found myself sobbing.These types of books are definitely not for everyone. Know your triggers, if you have them. There are plenty of reviews so you don\u2019t need to go in blind. Her books are extremely detailed and can sometimes be gruesome. That\u2019s what makes them so incredible and realistic.As with her others, the character development in this book was phenomenal. You truly understood the motivations behind the main characters and you felt their emotions during each twist and turn. The story is gripping and once you\u2019re in, if you can handle it, you won\u2019t be able to put it down.If you\u2019re interested in reading it, don\u2019t hesitate. It\u2019s absolutely worth it. I\u2019ve quickly become a huge Karin Slaughter fan after 4 books and I\u2019m looking forward to reading the rest!",

There are two mysteries, one from the past and one from the current day.I honestly never could have imagined how deep this families\u2019 secrets were!The three star rating is due to a lengthy description of an event at the very onset of the book. This same event is then told two more times; yes, from new perspectives with some new important details but the author could have saved the reader a lot of time by summarizing the event the second and third time with only heavily, detailed, descriptions of the new, relevant information/details. Instead, however, the reader is forced to read verbatim, the same very, detailed, oriented rendering of this event two more times with the exact word for word writing. It\u2019ll leave the reader experiencing major deja vu!Highly recommend this book and author; just need to be a patient reader!",

                "reviewText": "Overall, I really liked this book but felt that it was so unnecessarily long. It could have been condensed, and some areas it dragged on without really saying anything new. Some details didn't really need to be there and were just fluff. Not every single breath that people took nor a description of every inanimate item was needed. Lots of repetition with not much new info. I was irritated by that in the first 50% of the book, especially, but the overall storyline and family dynamic kept me reading. I was in the middle of a few other things that didn't allow me to read as much at once, so the amount of time it took me to get through the book probably didn't help this either.A truly heartbreaking story for many reasons. 3.5 rounded up to 4.The audible version of this story is excellent - 5/5 for that.",

With all its raw suspense and brutally honest depictions of the police and the legal system, this book satisfies the latter. If you're someone who isn't scared to have your safety bubble ruptured with naked visions of corruption and dirty politics, this book is definitely for you.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not sure where to start but I'm gutted that the books is over but relieved because I can get off this emotional roller coaster and get back to real life.Because I follow Harper Collins on Facebook I saw this book advertised. I clicked through and saw the price ($13.99 cad) and because I'm cheap and do bookbub I thought well maybe not. Then I saw she had a prequel to this novel for $2.99 so I bought that instead thinking if I really liked that one I could go back and buy this one.I read it in one night and started this book the same night and stayed up until 3 am reading then started again first thing when I got up at 8 and read until I was done.This book needs to be a movie.The beginning was so gripping and so terrifying I had major anxiety about what would happen next. The adrenaline alone kept me awake to keep reading.Then this morning in the second half of the book I cried so many times I am glad I was home alone! It's not often a book can make you laugh, be scared out of your wits, and the sob uncontrollably.If you are on the fence about reading this book, don't be. But order the prequel first too... worth the $3 for the extra emotional investment in what happens in this one.Either way, buy this book. But don't read it at night if want to sleep and maybe save it for a weekend or vacation so you can go at it all at once....because you will even if you do have to get up the next day.",
