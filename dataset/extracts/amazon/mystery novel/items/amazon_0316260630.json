        "description": "This bestselling and award-winning novel about a teenage girl in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam speaks powerfully to the realities of grief, heartbreak, and bravery, perfect for fans of Kristin Hannah and Ruta Sepetys. Amsterdam, 1943. Hanneke spends her days procuring and delivering sought-after black market goods to paying customers, her nights hiding the true nature of her work from her concerned parents, and every waking moment mourning her boyfriend, who was killed on the Dutch front lines when the Germans invaded. She likes to think of her illegal work as a small act of rebellion. On a routine delivery, a client asks Hanneke for help. Expecting to hear that Mrs. Janssen wants meat or kerosene, Hanneke is shocked by the older woman's frantic plea to find a person\u2014a Jewish teenager Mrs. Janssen had been hiding, who has vanished without a trace from a secret room. Hanneke initially wants nothing to do with such dangerous work, but is ultimately drawn into a web of mysteries and stunning revelations that lead her into the heart of the resistance, open her eyes to the horrors of the Nazi war machine, and compel her to take desperate action. Beautifully written, intricately plotted, and meticulously researched, Girl in the Blue Coat is an extraordinary novel about courage, grief, and love in impossible times.",

One request will set her on a dangerous journey. Hanneke has been asked to locate a young Jewish girl named Mirjam. For this assignment she will need to get help from a resistance group. The book is true to WWII and the horrors of the Nazis. One reason I find this such an important book for my school shelves is that we have a holocaust unit. I try to provide great books that accurately tell of the holocaust events. So many people sided with the Nazis, not because they hated the Jews but because they wanted to improve their own position in life. Some were just bystanders who didn\u2019t agree but didn\u2019t want to get involved. This book shows so many sides to this war. As a word of caution it is full of the violence that so many experienced. This type of history should never be watered down. I applaud this author for telling a story that is authentic and exactly what kids and adults should learn. We need more books like this that show the importance of resistance groups and people like Hanneke.",

                "reviewText": "In the midst of World War II, a girl makes a living smuggling goods to others in her city. Lipstick, food, coffee, you name it. But one day a customer as a request for something she has never found before. A girl. And when her path becomes intertwined with people from her past, will they together be able to find the girl before she is gone forever?This book was pretty good. I love historical fiction books, especially during the WWII time period, so I have enjoyed books such as The Girl from the Train (or is it the Girl on the Train?), Number the Stars when I was younger, Night, etc. This book had an interesting storyline I had not seen before, hitting off of the fact that certain goods were rare and people still wanted them, hence how the girl in the blue coat made her living. The writing was decent, could have been better, and some things were not necessary. If you do not pay attention things can get a little confusing.There was suspense throughout the book, characters were ok, but I did not like how it did not delve deeper into WWII and remained on the surface about a lot of things. SO, recommending this to younger YA readers, maybe middle school and up because of this and the writing not being super advanced.Parental Guidance: no curse words, sex/nudity, no extreme violence or graphic scenes, etc. Some people might want to know there is one character who turns out to be gay so some might keep that in mind when allowing a younger child to read the book depending on the parent/adult",

                "reviewText": "Amazing read! Wow. Makes you think, a lot. I quickly started caring about Hanneke and admired her determination and courage. War brings out so many different parts of our humanity. Hanneke reminds us of the need to harden oneself and look for every way to survive. The story is written so well that you feel pangs in the heart with agonizing loss and hope. It is beautiful that our basic need to love and be loved does not disappear. Ollie is an unsung hero. He is good to the core and I so very much liked him. Judith and Mina are wonderful and thankfully people like Mina left us evidence of the atrocities. I appreciated all the characters and the detail given to them, their roles, and to their surroundings. These teenagers and young adults had to tackle issues and situations that are too complicated for adults. The story was true to emotions dominating until someone managed to steady the situation and be a voice of reason. Anger, frustration, fear, forgiveness, love, bravery and much more were well portrayed. It was incredible how well written the story is and how I did not want to put it down. There were many twists and turns with quite a few surprises. This book is not only for the YA readers. It's a must read, especially if you enjoy historical fiction.",
