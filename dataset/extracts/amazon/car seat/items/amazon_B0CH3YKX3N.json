                "reviewText": "I've owned several carseat brands over my 14 years of being a mother, this being my first by Safety 1st. It's definitely a budget friendly option. You can trust that it is safe because all carseats must pass the same safety standards to be sold. However, this is probably the least padded/comfortable car seat I've owned for my kids thus far. The \"padding\" is quite thin and you can feel the hard plastic underneath. The button that allows you to tighten/loosen the straps is a pain to reach. The buckles are plastic and even though I know they're safe (because they have to be), it just personally feels cheap to me. It does have a pad that goes behind the head, but it does nothing to prevent my child's head from falling in an uncomfortable way if she falls asleep. In my opinion, I would personally pay a bit more for a more comfortable seat, but this seat works great for families on a budget.",

It performs admirably for larger children and can withstand the weight of heavier kids. It would be beneficial to include level tools on the sides for easier installation, especially in large SUVs with spacious seats. Despite this challenge, the chair maintains its overall high quality. Additionally, the inclusion of extra soft cushions would enhance comfort for children using the seat.",
