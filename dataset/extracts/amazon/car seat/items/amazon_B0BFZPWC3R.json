Unfortunately, the shoulder strap routes through a section of the booster seat which is difficult to get the shoulder strap in or out of. So every time my boys lock up the seat belt, it takes me about 3-5 minutes of struggling to get the shoulder strap out of that section of the booster seat in order to unlock the seat belt and then have to route the seatbelt back in to that section again.I likely would not ever purchase these seats again due to this frustrating issue that I deal with almost daily.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to like this booster seat however it needs improvement!! My son said it was very uncomfortable (not enough cushioning on back and seat). There is a thin covering the back when the top is raised for height. My son found it hard to buckle himself (he has been buckling himself, in his current Britax booster with lap guide, for about 3+ years). The cup holder snaps into the arm rest, this makes it very difficult to weave the seatbelt around it. In order for my son to buckle himself, I had to move the cup holder to the other arm rest, next to the door, which my kids, as I\u2019m sure most, bump into their cup getting out and I\u2019m left chasing a rolling cup through or under cars in a parking lot. It is a very poor placement for the cup holder. The arm rests need to be higher because there isn\u2019t much room to get buckle in between the arm rest and seat base.I liked the size and that it could seat a child until 10. This booster is designed for 6-10 yr. olds. I liked the seat cover and how easy it would be to remove to clean.Needs improvement:1. Cushioning / comfort2. Arm rests need to be higher off base3. Cup holder placement or place cup holder in the base like most booster seats",

                "reviewText": "We had Nuna Rava car seat and it was great but Nuna booster seemed very flimsy. I checked out Clek too, but it was kinda bulky and heavy, and attachment mechanism looked like could scratch leather seats. This uppababy is great, not neavy, not bulky, pretty wide and comfortable, attachment can easily hide inside if not used. Not as sturdy as Clek but still much better than Nuna and many other boosters",
