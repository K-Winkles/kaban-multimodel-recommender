This rotatable seat, along with magnetic buckle holders, makes it easy to get your child in and out. Designed for safety, the Sirona S features a steel-reinforced frame and anti-rebound design that reduces car seat rebound movement. Linear side-impact protection system absorbs up to 25% more impact in a collision when compared to the same car seat without L.S.P. extended. A one-time belt installation secures both forward and rear-facing positions. Our EasyLock\u2122 Bar works with your vehicle belt for easy and secure installation, while the dual-level indicators ensure the car seat is at the proper angle. Adjust your Sirona S as your child grows, with a 12-position headrest with no-rethread harness. SensorSafe\u2122 technology in the chest clip syncs automatically with your mobile app and provides alerts of unsafe situations, including if a child unbuckles themselves; if the back seat is too warm or cold, if a child has been seated for too long, or if the driver accidentally leaves the child behind.",

                "reviewText": "This is a must have car seat. I have 9 month old who had grown out of the carrier/ base combo type of car seat, and needed to purchase a new car seat. I have a 2010 2 door Camaro. You have to flip the seats front forward to get to the back. I purchased a traditional rear facing car seat. Since there was no way to get to the side of the traditional rear facing car seat, there was no way to get my daughter out.I went looking for a solution. The Cybex Sirona S, is truly a miracle seat. It only has to be installed once and can be switched from rear facing to forward facing as needed by pressing a recessed area at the front of the seat. This allows you to completely turn the seat around to get your child out. You will have to stretch your arm a bit towards the front of the seat to do this. By using the same recessed button, one can also increase or decrease the angle. The seat also has a stability leg that stabilized the seat. It has a safety feature that will use the Bluetooth on your phone and a plug that gets plugged into your OBDII port in your car. It will alert you if the temperature is too high for the baby in the car and also if the baby is in the car after it has been shut off.The car seat seems comfortable for my baby. I would not have been able to use my car without this car seat. I highly recommend it to any parent.",

They explained the way the bench in my car worked it wasn't a good fit for having it in the middle, though i'm sure this varies by vehicle. If it's important to you to have your car seat in the middle seat and you don't have an SUV, i'd go with something else. We now have it installed on the side and it's been wonderful. The swivel has been a big relief for my back, and I don't feel I had to make sacrifices safety wise for it like I did with other swivel seats I researched. Our daughter appears very comfortable, the straps move smoothly and hold her firmly in place, and the sensor-safe works extremely well (though I needed the pros to show me where to plug that in too!). Unfortunately kiddo vomited in it ,but we found it very easy to clean! Everything came off the base and went back on easily and washed right out the first try. When the seat swivels, the leg pops up which can be unsettling but once the seat is locked in place (forward or rear facing) it isn't going anywhere. I'm grateful for all of the visual reminders indicating the seat is installed properly because we moved our front seat and it knocked the support leg off kilter. I noticed right away because of the color coding indicators at the top. Very glad we chose this car seat!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this seat as I am becoming a foster parent for children 0-2. I wanted a convertible seat that would accommodate any child in this age range. I loved that this seat swiveled. It's currently the only convertible swivel seat in the USA.Back story: I survived a deadly car accident in 2012. I was driving an Audi, so since German engineering saved my life before, I had high hopes for this German car seat. (Made in China though) \ud83d\ude44I now drive a 2013 VW Jetta. When the car seat arrived today, later than expected due to the storms in New England, I was SO excited to put in the car.After two hours of trying to get this seat to not wobble, I called it a day. I'm returning it tomorrow morning. Which is a huge pain given that the refund doesn't come for 2-3 days AFTER the seller receives it. So I'll have to wait another two weeks to order a different seat.I have worked as a preschool teacher for all of my adult life and have installed hundreds of car seats over the years. I have NEVER seen a car seat wobble like this. Even the $40 Cosco car seat from Walmart didn't wiggle like this.For $500 I expected the dream convertible car seat but I am highly disappointed. There are multiple points on this seat that are flawed.1. The latch system belts are not sewn well. It wouldn't surprise me to see these become a reason for recall.2. The latch system doesn't fit well in the two alcoves meant to contain them once latched. They don't allow for the belt to be tightened enough because they're restricted to the space in the alcove.3. The belt system which is noted as the \"preferred\" method is useless. I'm sure the shape of my VW's seats play a role but minimally. The blue plastic pieces that are to hold the belt....I would say are upside down. There's nothing to prevent the seat belt from being pulled back up in the direction of the seat.4. Because of these little alcoves for the latch - you need to weave the belt through the alcoves but its such an odd space that again even with the car's seat belt, it won't tighten enough.5. Cybex thought to add a compartment on the back of the seat for the user manual but didn't think to add a handle anywhere on the seat to be able to carry it. It's HEAVY! And awkward!6. The fabric is so smooth (yay) but is a type that is going to grasp on to every hair or fiber that comes it way. I could tell immediately that it would be a bitch to maintain.7. The base itself has a much smaller width than the top of the seat. - I would think that due to physics this is why the thing wobbles. If the base was wider and more comprehensive espically by the edge of the VW's seat (where there's more natural give) then the Cybex wouldn't wobble.On a side note, I had emailed the company previously about any type of discount/program/grants available to try to lessen the cost. They emailed back to say they don't offer anything like that.Additionally, I couldn't find a crash test video anywhere for the seat.They sell for 270 Euro which converts to 195.5 Dollars.This Cybex seat is not worth $500.",

                "reviewText": "Love the rotating feature! I don\u2019t hate loading and unloading my kid anymore. It was pretty difficult to install we used the the preferred seat belt method. When installed improperly you will be able to notice because it is all wobbly. I was like nope we did something wrong lol! But once we set it up properly it was way better and it was not wobbly! My only issue is that the lock rotation indicator doesn\u2019t work and we called Cybex. They informed us that they had not heard of such an issue but as long as seat is locked when we aren\u2019t grabbing the handle to rotate it that it is good. Hope that makes sense. It\u2019s a tiny bit annoying but we checked when he was reclined if it rotated and it didn\u2019t and that means it is locked. I\u2019ll definitely keep an eye on that.",
