                "reviewText": "By far the most comfortable, lightweight, and stylish carseat I've ever gotten for my toddler. It's very padded and adjustable with multiple pads for different heights and comfortability. Perfect for sleeping too, I'm never worried about my toddler's head falling forwaed onto his chest causing difficulty breathing like other carseats have allowed. The carseat also extends too for taller kids who take after the string bean dads just like my son does!All padding is easily removable. The chest harness comes with 2 covers so your baby doesn't get a belt rash on their neck, and it even comes with gripping on the underside so that it holds onto your childs clothing and doesn't slide down only to be constantly readjusted.The harness strapping difficulty level I'd rate at a 2/5, the chest harness my toddler is able to buckle himself, and has an easily accessible button on the top to disconnect (not easy for kids though). The groin/thigh buckle however is a bit tougher- if you have weakness in your hands, or particularly in your thumbs you may need to use two hands, I can manage with just 1 hand with a strong and firm press in order to disconnect, although it gets to me some days especially when I'm sick.The carseat also comes with an attachable drink holder that is easy to clean that doesn't have drain holes (great for kids who like to pour our their drinks, my back seats where saved from cranberry juice because it didn't drain thankfully) and it can be easily attached to either side of the carseat.Installing it was a breeze especially since it came assembled! It also wasn't bulky which is a plus. I'd 1000% recommend this carseat and will be getting it again for my next children.If you're ever worried about which brand to buy and how much to spend on quality, this is your sign to buy it! Cost effective and reliable.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new car seat for my first baby who was outgrowing his first. I also wanted something that he could grown with so I wasn\u2019t purchasing another one again in a year AND that I could travel with. I\u2019ve taken this on two flights and on two vacations where it was used in a rental car and it is amazing. Fits great on a plane; yes I used it in an actual airplane seat. My child is a madman and I just knew he needed to be in a carseat. This was great. He is comfortable in it and I love how slim it is. Great price as well. He\u2019ll be able to fit in this since it extends for years.",

It isn\u2019t too heavy, and is easy to install and un-install. This would work from infant up to toddlers. Our baby is almost a year and she really seems to enjoy sitting up higher than the infant seats doing cars.",

                "reviewText": "We bought this before an international trip since my son recently outgrew his Doona. I first tried using the latch setup rear facing and it was impossible to tighten. I gave up. And I\u2019ve installed at least 4 or 5 other types of car seats before. Once we switched to the seat belt it was better. I do wish there was something on the sides to hold the straps between use. Every time I sit my son down I have to dig them out from under him. Otherwise it was a great seat, not too heavy to lug around the airport, and made it safe and sound both ways gate checked in a bag.",
