                "reviewText": "I still remember 18 years ago when my sister used Chicco everything, including fine carseats for her children.I chose Chicco because it's the only brand I trust. It's very comfortable for a child, and it's great for any weather. My daughter never complained of being uncomfortable in the seat. It feels more of quality and protects the child more than the other brand seats that I worked with. That's why in case of an accident my Daughter will be safe \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb. It's easy to clean the seat, I washed the fabric several times and it still looks brand new. I love the luxurious smart design of this car seat, it's very user friendly. I've been using this car seat for years and it's the best car seat I used for my child. I dare say it's a great buy and the car seat is worth every penny, because it lasts and after long use it still looks as if I bought it yesterday. When you use the Chicco brand you will never go back.",

                "reviewText": "I bought 2 of these for my twin boys after they started growing out of their first ones that they had as small babies. Although these were on the pricier side, I wanted something that would fit them comfortably now and would also be something they could grow into.They are very bulky, but I liked that. They have arm rests and each come with 2 cup holders. You can remove the cup holders if you want just one on each or if you'd prefer not to have them at all. There is a small level on the side that shows you how much the seat is angled and there are instructions telling you what is appropriate for either harness mode or booster mode. There are 4 levels of recline and 9 positions for the headrest to keep kids comfortable.The harness is easy to use comfortable for my boys. It really does feel like they are safe in this carseat. The hooks to anchor it into the seats are also easy to use. There is a button to release so you don't have to try and use those clamps like with other seats. I really love this carseat and my boys love them as well. I highly recommend as a mother who wants to feel her babies are safe.",

I feel at ease when he is in the seat. We even convinced his grandparents to return another brand they\u2019d just bought to get this one instead. So well built! Highly recommend, it\u2019s worth the price for peace of mind and comfort for your child.",

I love the accommodating headrest so that her head doesn\u2019t hang like her other Gracco car seat , the installation ease and most importantly the roomy buckling belt. There\u2019s enough room for her to move her legs and not feel too constrained. The Gracco brand was getting hard to close around her legs. I know she\u2019ll be using this car seat for a very long time (weight capacity is 35-100 lbs). My granddaughter and I love it and that makes me very happy. I will be ordering a 2nd car seat. Note: please do your research, watch any YouTube videos before making your purchase. I highly recommend this product!",

I dropped a star because the harness straps are more difficult for my five year old to navigate (and me honestly) than his past Britax Marathon seat. Especially the cover for the crotch buckle - it really gets in the way. Overall I would still recommend the seat but I don\u2019t like it as much as the Britax, which he\u2019s unfortunately outgrown.",
