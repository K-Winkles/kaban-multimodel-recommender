It's a hassle digging receptacles our from under the seat, especially with child restraints around. The Buckle Booster snaps around your receptacle in a second to ensure: your seat belt buckle doesn't get buried. Making your receptacle stand up and be easily accessible for future rides, this adult and kid-friendly tool transforms buckling into a breeze.",

No more wobbly belt that is hard to hold while buckling. No more buried receptacle hiding smugly under the seat or behind car or booster seats.",
            "RAISES YOUR BUCKLE - The trouble with buckling can be multifold: bad angle, inadequate space, too far to reach for the buckle. All of these can waste your time and cause knuckle scrapes. The Buckle Booster elevates and angles your seat belt receptacle so the belt metal tongue can click in smoothy and effortlessly. No more strain and struggle - buckle yourself and others quickly and without hassle!",
            "BPA FREE MATERIAL - SAFE FOR ALL AGES - The BPA-free Buckle Booster allows you to buckle up with just one hand, whether you are in a hurry or have mobility challenges.

Keeping the receptacle stable, you just need to click the metal tongue in and you're ready to go!",
            "BUCKLE FASTER, BETTER. CLEVER! - Reaching from the side to buckle babies and others is frustratingly impossible because of the floppy buckles getting buried under seats. With three booster or car seats in the back, your buckling task can be impossible. With the Buckle Booster, made from safe materials, buckling loved ones in the back is easy! You can comfortably reach the receptacle, even between car / booster seats. Just one car seat or an adult in the back? Reach the elevated buckle in a snap!"
