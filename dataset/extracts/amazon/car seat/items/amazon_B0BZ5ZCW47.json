                "reviewText": "This car seat I feel is definitely a safe one for child protection, but the attachment for snapping your child in and out of the seat is difficult to lock and unlock. Also it takes up some much space, so you might want to install in the middle of the backseat rather than behind a seat. Otherwise, you are having to pull the front seat up where it might not be comfortable for the passenger or driver.",
