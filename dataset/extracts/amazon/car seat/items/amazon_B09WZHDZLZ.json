It runs great and to avoid taking on an unnecessary car payment I continue to drive it. That said, I wanted to make a couple of small cosmetic touch-ups to spruce it up.I am so pleasantly surprised by these seat covers. They went on very easily\u2026less than 20 minutes for both included the separate headrest covers. Second, the video instructions were easy to follow and the installation was straightforward as a result. Finally, and most importantly, they do exactly what they are meant to do\u2014they cover the seats completely, front and back, without gaps, tearing and look pretty good. Honestly, the headrest covers couldn\u2019t fit any better. I drive a 2011 Ford Focus (if that helps anyone else). I\u2019ve had them on for a couple of weeks now and haven\u2019t experienced a single issue.The photos show the front driver\u2019s seat, passenger\u2019s seat and back of the the driver\u2019s seat, respectively. The last one is meant to show how low the cover fits. All fit well with no tears or awkward seams.For the money, I can\u2019t imagine a better product for a simple cosmetic upgrade.",
