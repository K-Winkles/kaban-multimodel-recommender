The one reason I got this chair is that it RECLINES even when looking forward, so when your baby/toddler falls sleep the head is not hanging forward. It did give us a bit of trouble to install, the belt for the latch lock was all the way inside the sit. Very much recommend this!",

                "reviewText": "This is my third car seat, ordered in preparation for my second child. My previous two car seats are two Graco Extend2Fit seats that I was perfectly happy with. I had planned to reorder that model, but when I saw this available on Vine I decided to take the plunge and try something different. Overall, this is an outstanding car seat: very well-built with excellent cushions/padding built-in (much softer than the Graco seats I have currently) with a relatively straightforward installation.PROS:- Installation and set up is fairly straightforward. I say \"fairly\" because car seat setups are ridiculously complicated and reading the included manual is a must - even if you've got some experience - but compared to the other car seats I have, the Magellan was no more or less difficult to install. Everything arrived essentially assembled in the box, so the only \"setup\" that was necessary was learning how to tighten the various straps to get everything fitted correctly.- I thought the \"plush\" and \"full-European design\" descriptors would be a bit of a gimmick, but I have to admit that this thing is extremely well-built. The cushion and padding is extremely soft - it feels more premium than the Graco seats I have. Obviously I can't test the seat myself, but it feels quite comfortable and soft to the touch. My baby seems to be quite comfortable in it.- Size adjustments are very straightforward. Again, you're going to need the manual to get everything set up correctly, but after messing around with it for a few minutes I got the hang of it.CONS:- The seat is quite heavy, heavier than the other Graco seats that I have. This isn't much of an issue for me - once it's installed it's going to stay in the car - but something to keep in mind if you're planning to move this around multiple cars, travel with it, etc. You might want to get spring for a lighter model if portability is important.My car seat experience is relatively limited, but this model is the best of the car seats that I own. The price is a bit steep - about $100 more than the Graco models that I also own - but the build quality definitely feels superior to the other seats, and the ability to significantly extend the seat does make the higher price a bit easier to stomach. Other than the significant weight, I have no complaints. Recommended!",

                "reviewText": "This car seat is luxurious compared to the graco and chicco car seats we have owned. Here is the run down:1. The car seat cover IS fully removable. It's designed in a way that hides all of the seams but with enough fiddling you can find how to take it off. Unfortunately the manual does lack some information about this and currently there isn't much info online in terms of how to videos. But if you read the pages (pages 64-68) that cover the installation of the cover you can back track to figure out how to fully remove it.2. This car seat does NOT expire before it's calaimed usage at all, if anything it lasts a little longer. In the manual it very clearly states that this expires 12 years after the manufacturing date. My manufacturing date was Oct-2022, so not that long ago. Unless you buy this a couple years in advance, used, or the manufacturing date is way prior to your purchase date, it does last the advertised time frame plus a little more. The bigger constraining factor are the height and weight limits. So if you have a heavier or taller child, they could outgrow this sooner than the 10 years advertised.3. The cup holders are removable which is amazing! If your kiddos are like mine, there is always crumbs and stickiness everywhere so this makes it amazing to clean.4. It is certified for plane use (except for as a booster seat for older kids) but this thing is HEAVY. I personally wouldn't want to lug this around the airport, but if you wanted to, you could.5. Price point is much steeper than graco or Chicco. That being said, this is much more cushiony, looks way more high end, and the quality difference is quite noticeable. If I would have combined the price I paid for my kids infant seat with the toddler one, I would have been better off getting this one instead.6. Aside from being super heavy, I don't love the chest buckle. That is the only part of this car seat that felt cheap to me.Pictured are my 3.5yr old and my 1yr old on it for scale.Overall, this is a great buy, offers excellent value, just make sure you thoroughly read the manual and fiddle with the car seat to get familiar with it's full functionality!",

The pictures shown are the second one. The tether strap should at least be up further. When we pulled on what was in my daughter\u2019s hand? All it did was pull her crotch strap through!!!!!Considering I bought 4 car seats and have now had to return 3 of the 4? I am just beyond frustrated\u2026.The first one was a revive around that actually cut my daughters finger whileTrying to install it!Almost 2k dropped and I wound up with 2 Graco Extend2Fit Convertible Car Seats for under $400.Amazon is finally contacting the manufacturer\u2026\u2026They didn\u2019t offer me anything for my trouble or aggregation either & I\u2019m still waiting for my almost $150 in reward point back too\u2026.
