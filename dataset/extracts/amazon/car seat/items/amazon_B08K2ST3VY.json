This organizer is an asset! I always like to carry extra car oil, water, jump leads, pump, medical supplies, drinks, small array of tools and so on, so you can see how the car quickly gets junked up. This organizer was easy to set up, it has clips to go over the back head rests and then side / bottom Velcro sticks to anchor it down. There are a number of large pockets and mesh sleeves at the bottom. Everything I need has now been nicely organised! I don't dread opening my boot now! or fear what the dogs have found to chew on the back seat! Its all safely put away in this organiser in the boot! My only concern would be if I ever needed to push the back seats down (when needing extra room for larger items) then this organiser will have to be emptied and then all put back afterward, which is a nuisance but for people who use their boot as a normal boot - for shopping or luggage and not transporting large items then this wouldn't be a problem! The material used seemed both durable and reasonable quality and I was very impressed for the price. Good item!",
