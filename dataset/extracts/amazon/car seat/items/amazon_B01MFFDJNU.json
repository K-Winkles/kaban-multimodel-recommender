Some staples and a razor knife to trim the excess off and done. Cant wait to get the paint done and see them mounted. Thanks for a great product.",

These look so good on our old pre-2000s DS cart that we are remodeling.Third, It was recommended to us that we get a heat gun to help stretch the material and that definitely helped! We 100% recommend getting a $20 heat gun from like harbor freight to help loosen the leather and make sure you can get a nice tight seat.",
