I'd give this 5 stars if it did. But good booster with very short, low profile arm rests. Major plus so the child can actually buckle herself into the vehicle! It isnt obnoxiously large, obstructing the view and reach ability of the buckle.",

I love the cloth cup holders, too--so much nicer than those bulky plastic ones!",
