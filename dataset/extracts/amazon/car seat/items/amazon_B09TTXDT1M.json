        "description": "Weve taken the award-winning Monterey and painstakingly engineered 15 upgrades to create the next generation of boosters. From the remodeled headrest, enhanced fabric covering, contoured seat base and breathable exo-shell panels, weve considered every last detail to create a contemporary new look. Contoured to fit and shaped in harmony with your child, Monterey 4DXT adjusts and expands as your little one grows to offer wonderful all-round protection. The height and width can be adjusted independently for safety that envelopes their head and shoulders up to 12 years of age. A simple-to-use dial on the back adjusts the width of the seat to fit a childs shoulders up to 20 wide, while the headrest adjusts up to 6.4 height with one hand for an easy precise fit. The remodeled headrest is lined with thick EPP foam for better child comfort and improved side impact performance. This is combined with deeper side wings and Diono 4-layer Side Impact Protection System built in. From the EPP foam coating, to the molded rigid shell casing and EPS coated outer shell, weve lovingly engineered every detail to keep your little one safe, mile after mile. Here at Diono we dont just stop at superior safety. The ergonomically contoured seat base improves the child seating position with luxury AIRTEK foam cushioning for total child comfort. Weve even added breathable exo-shell side panels to enhance airflow to keep them cool on the move. We've reduced the width of the vehicle seatback to make installation easier, improving access to vehicle seatbelts and promoting independent buckling. And with easily removable backrest and intuitive belt guides, the Monterey 4DXT offers 2 seats in 1 when they are ready to graduate to a backless booster. Like all Diono boosters, expect up to 8 years of reliable service. So, when it comes to your next booster, look to the Monterey 4DXT latch to take your child on their journey in safety and style.",

                "reviewText": "I have spent about $1000 in car seats over the past 7 years.My son was a 9lb baby and shrieked to high hell when he was placed in his infant car seat. By the time he was 3 months, I switched him into a Primo Viaggio Convertible. Then 3 years, he was switched to a Britax Pinnacle G2.1, top of the line. We were t-boned by a person looking at their phone while driving and so the Britax was replaced by a Chicco MyFit Harness LE.My son is always in the 100 percentile range. He's tall and wide. The MyFit was no longer cutting it at 6 years old. The back is cut slim and my son kept moving side to side or leaning forward to get comfortable. In comes the Diono.The Diono is adjustable both ways. I have it set at the widest and my son sits back and the seat hugs him. He is very comfortable and I feel he may be able to stay in this seat till about 9-10. He is 7 now and we took our time writing this review, we have had the seat for over 3 months now and my 5 year old daughter can't wait to get one of her own. She loves sitting in her brothers seat, it's a throne to them.This seat is huge. We have a Honda Pilot and eventually the sister will get a Diono as well. So you need to have the space for this giant car seat.Alot of reviews said this seat has no plush. This is correct.This is no frills but the age this seat caters to no longer cares for plush, they want comfort and fit. My son loves his seat and I'm glad I found this.I highly recommend this seat, Amazon gives a 3 month return window on this item, so if your child isn't happy, just return it.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very nice booster....well made, fairly light weight but sturdy, easy to put the back on / off, seems comfortable to my granddaughter. I'm happy with it. There are 2 negatives: the seat could use more cushioning if used for longer trips, but this is easy to address by adding some foam under the seat cover, which is easy to do. The second is that it is quite wide even before you expand it as your child grows. I use it mostly in my BMW X5 SUV and it will be tight at the shoulders to get this chair plus 2 people across the back seat....possible, but not real comfortable for any distance. If you never put 2 other people back there with the chair, no problem. Oh and for those reviews that say the back seperates from the seat very easily when you pick it up.....that is not my experience. If you pick it up with one hand under the seat and one hand on the back..the natural approach, I think....no problem at all.",

This has much more width than or Graco and the headrest is higher. The seatbelt does rub against a foam part sometimes making an annoying noise, but I think it\u2019s when she leans forward or is in a certain position. Would buy again for sure! I did a lot of research and this is the best/safest for the cost.",

She says it's comfy even though when I feel it seems like it doesn't have nearby the padding of her nuna rava convertible seat, which she just grew out of. We have an uppbaby knox too, and it seems more in line with that padding around the head. We got the blue, and she loves the color. it's very easy for her to buckle herself, and she loves the independence as well as the cup holders. She also likes not having the belt guide in between her legs. For parents, it is very wide, even without expanding, just so you know. It fits great in the third row of our odyssey minivan, but it does slightly obstruct center visibility with the wings around the head.",
