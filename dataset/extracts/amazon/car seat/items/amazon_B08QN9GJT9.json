                "reviewText": "I love this car seat. It is super easy to install with the supercinch system. It takes less than 5 minutes to get an excellent and safe installation. The seat itself seems really comfortable and most importantly really sturdy. I like the high sides and the protection they seem to offer. Despite the high sides and having a small vehicle, I have had no issues getting an almost 2 year old in rear facing.The zip cover makes it really easy to clean, which is really nice. This seat is really well made and feels to be of very high quality. I feel that it is much sturdier than graco seats but easier to use and clean than Britax seats. It is easy to loosen, tighten, and to get a good fit. The headrest is easily adjustable for proper harness height which is a lifesaver if you ever need to use it for another child. It reclines very easily as well.Overall this seat is very safe and very easy to use. It appears comfortable and would be a great seat for anyone who wants convenience, safety, and comfort.",

Doesn\u2019t leave bruises like our old Graco E2F! The belts glide so easily when tightening everything. This is a miracle seat, I swear! It also has a little compartment in the back to store the user manual. That\u2019s so nice! I can\u2019t recommend this enough!",

                "reviewText": "When my son outgrew his Britax infant seat I did hours of research and finally settled on the Graco Extend2fit based on its great reviews and moderate price. I absolutely hated it, and my son would scream the entire time he was strapped in it. I could never seem to get a good fit in either the seat itself or for my 1 year-old, 22 lb son.Next I tried the Britax Boulevard ClickTight with ARB. I have always exclusively used Britax car seats with my other children and had high hopes for this one. My car has second row bucket seats and this particular seat is HUGE! Once again, I could not get this seat to fit appropriately and unfortunately had to return it.I continued my search and for some reason this Chicco seat doesn\u2019t come up on many \u201csafest or best convertible car seat\u201d lists but does get great reviews on Consumer Reports so I decided to give it a try. I could tell at once this seat would be different-it just looked super comfortable and my son did not fuss or cry when I put him in to try it. I then went to install it and this was the only seat I could install by myself and let me tell you it is rock solid\u2014the installation of this car seat is amazingly simple and it really does take a quick pull of each latch strap. I did have to use a foam child seat positioner to get adequate recline, but the fit is perfect now!! Fits great in my bucket seats and my son loves it!!! Also seems to be one of the safest so I could not be more pleased with this purchase!!! Thank-you Chicco and Amazon!!",

                "reviewText": "Started out with the Chicco KeyFit 30 and loved it. My sister (also using the KeyFit 30) was unfortunately recently in a serious accident with her 8 month old in the car and her KeyFit didn\u2019t even budge during the incident. My precious nephew had not a scratch, bruise or pain to speak of. So we are indebted to the company and loyal to the Chicco brand. Rated to 30 lbs or 30 inches, our super tall kiddo out grew the KeyFit 10 lbs early! So we upgraded to the Nextfit Zip Max and I can\u2019t brag about this seat enough. Not only does it look really sharp and offer some seriously great comfort features (like the premium cushiony materials, shoulder pads and buckle pad), but it is one of the most secure-fitting seats i\u2019ve ever seen. There is almost no movement at all, whether you\u2019re testing from the belt path or the seat top (which is generally not recommended due to the natural movement that can be expected, as physics goes). Even compared to the KeyFit, the install is very secure. I love the leg room this seat boasts (and so does she). And the reclining feature (which wasn\u2019t really a selling point to me initially) is a real life saver! I adjusted it too far upright, her head tipped forward when she slept and even short trips were a nightmare. After a simple adjustment (in the gas station parking lot because I couldn\u2019t take it anymore), I found the magic number and Lights Out! Now all trips are a breeze! Thus far, we are only using it in rear facing mode so I can\u2019t speak to the convertibility, but we are loving the comfort, flexibility and most of all SAFETY this seat provides! It\u2019s expensive but worth every penny!",

It\u2019s soft, sturdy and seems comfortable. It appears to be safe and I know it will be easy to install. I was using a Chicco Keyfit30 infant Carseat and loved it! But my child has graduated. I tried buying a different brand and ended up returning it when I was able to snag this NEXTFIT on sale for 199 which is way better than 319. It\u2019s a shame car seats cost so much when you are working with a tight budget. But it\u2019s worth it for peace of mind and should last many years. If you\u2019re stuck trying to decide what car seat I would recommend this one. I\u2019m very happy with this purchase!",
