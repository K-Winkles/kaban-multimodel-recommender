Accommodating children 22-110 lbs, stage one has a 5-point harness for children at least 2 years old, and stage two allows you to use the vehicle belt as a high back booster for children at least 4 years old. The up-front harness adjustment is centralized, making it easy to properly tighten the harness. As they grow, the shoulder belt guide assists in positioning the vehicle's belt across your child's shoulder to provide optimal safety. Children appreciate the dual integrated cup holders to keep their snacks and drinks secure. The removable, machine-washable seat pad allows for easy cleanup of any messes. The Maestro is designed, engineered, tested and assembled in the United States. Even\ufb02o car seats have been tested above and beyond industry standards and undergo our rigorous side impact and dynamic rollover tests. Additionally, all car seats include live video installation support, giving you the tools and con\ufb01dence to securely and correctly install your car seat.",

I also liked the color choices (we got the \u201cWhitney\u201d).I found it to be easy to assemble and the straps were pretty easy to adjust as well.Not sure why so many customers are complaining about the cup holders falling off other than the instructions on here only seem to mention they \u201csnap on\u201d)\u2026the manual that\u2019s included with the seat clearly states to snap them in place then turn over and insert screws (included!) and screw them in place with a phillips head screw driver being careful not to over tighten. Easy!Installation was simple for me as well.Photos included show seat installed in a Hyundai Sonata. Child is 3 years old 38lbs , 37.75in tall.",

She now is not touching the seat and is more comfortable. The only thing o dislike is the harness doesn\u2019t extend very far out and can be tight! So you may have to just use the seatbelt option which I don\u2019t want to do just yet!",
