Me and my wife went to many stores, check many types of car seats and this definately was the biggest, most robust and safer we can find.We bought it on amazon because it was $30 cheaper than in the store. When it arrived we checked the manufactured date (because of the experation date and all that) and we found that it was just 4 month old wich is a perfectly acceptable age for these kind of products.The only bad thing I can say about it is that is so much bigger than other ones because it can carry a child up to 100 pounds, but since you are supposed to know that well ahead you go looking for it, it is expected. I totally recommend you buying this for your kids, and better here on amazon if it's cheaper.",
