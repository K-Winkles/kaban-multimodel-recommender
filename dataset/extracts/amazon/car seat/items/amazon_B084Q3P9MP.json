I\u2019m using it for a toddler and they\u2019re used to a big car seat like the maxi cosi or graco convertible ones so this was an adjustment in the seated positioning. As it is smaller and not as elevated. They fit well and it feels secure and easy to adjust to height.I got it to fit in my sante fe. It\u2019s in the middle of two infant car seats on both sides. The convertible car seat was too big to fit with the infant car seats too. I plan to buy 2 more when my infants outgrow the buckets.",

I would say I\u2019m afraid to wash it as others have said it doesn\u2019t fit properly after and I used just a wash clothe on it and can see that after just 4mo of use the fabric looks worn. The install was difficult & I\u2019m really not sure if it\u2019s exactly correct. We turned the seat forward facing for a better fit as our son is right at the mark for being forward facing.

This is definitely not a car seat to be traveling with UNLESS you're making a road trip.

They both have pros and cons.Britax blvd click tight - so easy to install, no re thread harness. Adjustable recline. Cons: fabric isn\u2019t as nice, higher profile. Cup holder is useless.Diono: pro: lower profile, anti rebound bar, nicer fabric. Cup holder is easierCons: cannot adjust recline, have to re thread to adjust harness, the head rest is awkward/bulky for smaller toddlers. The harness straps are bulky and my toddler easily takes them off to play with. Very hard to install. The legs for the RF plastic base hit my latch connectors. Could only install correctly in middle seat.Overall-I feel stuck with this because it\u2019s a lower profile than the Britax and it works for my car. If I didnt Need every single last cm of space I wouldve went with the Britax. They are very similar in that they are not very wide but for my car the lower profile made a difference. For the price I wish They would add no rethread harness and an adjustable recline. My toddler doesn\u2019t want to be laying back so far while RF.",

But for me, in a 2008 Forester getting three car seats, 2 were to diono's and an infant car seat did not work. The diono's were too tall for where the support bar behind the rear door was located. They did not fit in a middle and side orientation as it pushed the infant seat at a weird angle that was not safe.So if you were looking for a suggestion for a 2008 Foreste: get one Diono, and two Graco slim fit lx. Those do fit in only two combinations, but they do fit. We love our Diono and that's why I had tried it as a 3 cross option originally.",

                "reviewText": "THANK YOU Diono for Keeping my child Safe!!! After installing my NEW Diono 3QX I couldn\u2019t believe the level of SAFETY and COMFORT my child gets to travel in. This seat really does provide OPTIMUM safety! The number of safety features listed in the handy manual is off the charts. For starters it has a full steal frame which makes it a little heavy but stresses the level of engineering and detail taken in making this unit. This seat has larger side walls with multiple layers of protective materials ensuring my child\u2019s safety if ever in a side impact fender bender. This seat also has a memory foam cushion that my child gets to sit on while driving back and forth to Grandma\u2019s house, my kid is traveling in luxury. All kidding aside this seat is loaded with soooo many options and features. The great thing about this seat is it will last me for at least 10 years! It has a longer life span then most seats in the market place and when in it's in a rear facing installation I can use it until she is 50lbs, it also converts to a forward facing positioned seat with a reinforced steal anti-rebound bar and when the time is right, it converts into a FULL BACK BOOSTER, which means I won't have to buy another seat, my child will just transition into it as she grows and grows. The adjustable headrest is very simple to use, it slides up and down 12 positions and it\u2019s a breeze to adjust. Lastly the fabric feels comfortable, looks stylish and is easy to clean because the cover is removable and machine washable!!! AMAZING!!!!",

                "reviewText": "Wow, aesthetically speaking this car seat if off the charts. My wife and I looked at several different brands over the last few months before transitioning our daughter to the next step. This convertible car seat doesn\u2019t disappoint. Initially, we settled on the 3RXT. However, after committing to a little research, we found that the 3QX had additional safety features that we felt were essential to providing the best protection for our baby. The key features important to us were side-impact protection (6 layers\u2026awesome) and keeping baby rear-facing as long as possible. Our previous infant car seat didn\u2019t have an anti-rebound bar. We chose the 3QX over the 3RXT based on this additional feature. I now realize how important this option can be in preventing excess rebounding in a collision. Also, I assumed that all car seats were tested for roll overs. Again, thanks to my research I found out this was not the case. I\u2019m glad Diono takes child safety seriously. It feels like there are doing a little more to protect my child. Finally, the steel frame was a deciding factor over the competition. Although I pray we won\u2019t need it, I feel safer knowing we have a car seat made with steel frame protecting our child in a possible car crash.The other key features we considered a bonus were a memory foam cushion for seated comfort. Although we don\u2019t have three children, it\u2019s nice to know we could fit three across in our car when needed. Read between the lines honey. I much prefer the adjustable headrest on the 3QX over the 3RXT. We love to travel, therefore this car seat is ideal because it offers a foldable seat pan and is airline certified. Also, I found out that most airlines won't charge for car seats. It just makes to sense to use our own car seat vs. a rental seat. These are all great features that sold us on the Radian 3QX.",

So I let my partner handle it on his own so I didn\u2019t intervene with my comments. We were mentally prepared to allow the time for set up. It has a lot of features since it convertible and because it\u2019s heavy, it requires a lot of patience. It took him over an hour. We are happy with the seat and our daughter loves sitting forward. While we wanted to keep her facing backward, she is very tall and skinny at 16 months so rear facing mag not be good for her long legs. She barely met the min. require weight of 22lbs this week for us to set up the new seat. She is super comfortable in it and already had her first snooze in the seat.",
