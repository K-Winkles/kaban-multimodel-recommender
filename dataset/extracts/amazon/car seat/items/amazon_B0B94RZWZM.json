                "reviewText": "I am extremely happy with the quality, comfort, and ease of use that this car seat offers. When our daughter was young, we started with a \"carrier\" style car seat - the kind where a locking base remains in the car, and the seat containing the baby lifts out. We transitioned to this car seat right around 1 year old, and I think I would follow that same schedule if I were to do it again.The previous car seat we had was more of a \"lay down\" style, which I felt worked very well for a newborn / young baby. This car seat seems to be more of a \"sit up\" style (even with the adjustable angle) - and while she loves it at 1 year old, I'm not sure it would have been a great fit when she was younger.That said, she does absolutely love it. She's able to sit up, see more, and interact with her toys more naturally. It's also easier to maneuver her into the car seat, as the angles are less awkward. The nice thing is that this seat should cover us for many years to come - as it evolves with the various attachments and configurations to match the appropriate age/weight combination.An important point to note, this car seat is very large - probably a necessity to be able to cover the range of ages that it does. But, it's an important consideration because it limits functionality within the car. In our car (4 door sedan), the front passenger seat ends up at such an angle (due to this car seat behind it) that it's uncomfortable to sit in / frankly not a usable seat. So that's definitely a consideration if you regularly need to use every seat in your car.A (perceived) benefit of the car seat is that with its large size (tons of padding), it does feel very robust and protective - I'm very comfortable having my daughter in this car seat. There are a few areas where it seems like they might have saved on cost, however. A few elements don't seem quite as refined as our other car seat - the belt tightness adjuster, the manner in which the car seat installs, the way the car seat adjusts for leveling purposes, the unfinished feel of the plastic base, etc. It all feels a bit rough, and doesn't have the same quality feel as the rest of the car seat - it feels like they cut some corners on the \"nice to have\" details, to perhaps shave a few dollars off the production cost. Fortunately once the (somewhat challenging) installation is complete, you don't have to deal with those elements too much - aside from the belt adjuster, which is more frequently used.All in, this is a great upgrade - you just have to make sure it's the right fit for your vehicle, and decide if it's the right fit for your baby relative to their age/weight & the manufacturer's instructions.",

With this, we expect to not have to buy another. There are inserts that start to protect baby, from birth, and then this converts to (10) years old. It\u2019s durable, bulky, but easy to handle. I love the Disney theme. Set-up is easy and offers security for the unthinkable. My little one can ride rear facing, from 4-40 pounds; forward-facing to 65 pounds; and up to 100 pounds in the booster seat mode. Conversion to the next stage of growth is simple, allowing for quick adjustments. What is nice about this, for instance, is its multi-level position recline, 5 headrest heights, and a shoulder harness that I can adjust quickly, with the headrest. We like name brand products because they look after their brand.All the padding feels thick, yet soft to the touch. The fit and finish is perfect, not a thread out of place, seams are all tight, and the appearance fun. Everything vacuums or is wiped clean with ease. If the mess is bad, we can remove the covers, throw in the washer and then the dryer. Baby has no issues and falls asleep most of the time we are driving. Because they are comfortable; and baby also likes to fiddle with the pads they have grown out of.Countries of originSupposedly USA, per listing, I could not find any markFabrics are tagged as made in VietnamSeatbelt straps are tagged as ChinaValueCompetitively priced.
