This is amazing and save a lot of work for her! Grandma you not sure what to get your grown children? Do them a big favor and buy one or two of these they will thank you just like my daughter did. Also a doctor she works with says she never goes anywhere without one!!! The price is great the quality is great order some today!! You won\u2019t be sorry. Shellie",

                "reviewText": "Really great for traveling! Just roll up in a small bag and put it with your carry on on the plane. It literally inflates / deflates within seconds of blowing it in or out. Super convenient In the rental car on vacation. My 6-year old loved it and was comfortable sitting there. We used it for 2 weeks and it was great!The only thing is, read the instructions as you are not supposed to leave this seat inflated for a long period of time in a hot car. But that wasn\u2019t a problem for me since it inflates so quickly.",

                "reviewText": "It was easy to inflate and put in the car, but the seat slips around a lot. I wish it had a rubber antislip material on the bottom. I found myself holding it in place during the ride. It did give my son the extra inches to be able to safely use a regular seat belt. We only used this during travel to and from airport 15 minute drives max. Easy to deflate and store in a backpack while not using.",
