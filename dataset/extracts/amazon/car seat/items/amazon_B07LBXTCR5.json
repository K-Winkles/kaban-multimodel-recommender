For additional safety, the Eternis S features Linear Side Impact Protection (L.S.P.), which reduces side impact collision forces by up to 25% compared to the same seat without L.S.P. Keep your little one in comfort with a 3-point reclining headrest that guides your child\u2019s head into an ergonomically correct position for sleep. An in-seat recline provides extra legroom when you need it, so your child can safely ride rear-facing for longer.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using car seats since my oldest was born, 16 years ago! Safety, comfort, and features have changed SO much in that time. I am usually a loyal Graco and Britax car seat purchaser, but this seat won me over with the extra features. The fabric is smooth, soft, and nicely padded. The 3 way adjustable headrest is going to come in so handy when my LO gets older. Installation was fast, we're talking less than 2 minutes rear-facing. Having multiple recline options means not having to use pool noodles to get a proper level. My LO is 10 months and was all smiles for her first 30min car ride in this seat. I would highly recommend it if you are looking for top of the line safety and comfort!",
