After using it extensively, here is my list of pros and cons.Pros:- Easy, secure installation: The straightforward installation provides peace of mind from the start. Securing the seat with the vehicle belt takes just minutes and gives a sturdy, shake-free fit.- Adjustable for growing kids: The high back adds protection in case of side impacts while the headrest and height adjustments grow with my kiddo.- Portable for transfers between vehicles: Literally just grab and go because its lightweight.- Budget-friendly cost: Compared to other brands, the price was economical and competitive.Cons:- Fabric stains over time- Less side cushioning than premium brands- Kids complain about comfort on very long drivesIf you're seeking reliable protection for your kids without overspending, the user-friendly Graco TurboBooster ticks all the boxes. Safety above all, but value matters too - this seat delivers both. Hope this review helped.",

Lately, a second one has come in handy for being able to get his friend to/from school sometimes. The removable back is perfect for those who are on the smaller side and will be using a booster for longer. The seatbelt holder is easy to use and makes it simple to go from one car to the other. The cup holders are easily accessible for the young ones to use on their own. For those who are about to make the switch from a car seat, this is a great booster to go with.",
