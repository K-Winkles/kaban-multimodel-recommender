                "reviewText": "Stroller and Car seat review\u2014I am a new mom expecting twins. When it comes to basically anything I do a lot of research before I make a final decision. I bought the graco duo glide double stroller back when it was on sale around Black Friday. It was fairly priced and had a lot of good reviews. My husband and I put it together. It was very easy and did not take long at all. We practiced folding it, opening and lifting it in and out of my Mazda CX 5. It just fits sideways in the back of my Mazda. I\u2019m a smaller person and I can honestly say that this stroller is not very heavy and easy to use, I love the storage underneath too.We finally purchased the graco snugride snug lock 35 lx with click connect after narrowing it down to 3 infant graco car seats. We went to a few different stores to be able to see them in person and see how heavy they were going to be. This car seat was definitely the lightest out of all of them. It\u2019s about 9lbs compared to 17pounds or more. The design is very sleek and soft, also it does come with a newborn insert. I also love the safetly harness and it comes with seat belt covers so that they don\u2019t rub against their neck. After doing a little research to see how both car seats snap into the stroller, we got them in. The very front was easy to snap down onto the cup holder tray. The one closest to the back of the stroller was a bit tricky. The arm bar is actually hidden under the cup holder tray. So you have to snap that off and the arm bar is good to go to snap the car seat down on it.Overall I can\u2019t wait to be able to use these items with our twins. I\u2019m very satisfied with the quality so far and the easy installation.",

                "reviewText": "My brother had a baby, so I got this as a baby shower gift along with an extra base and stroller that all worked together. Him and his wife love the ease of use of the stationary base. Being able to just click the car seat in place and not having to worry about dealing with seatbelts evetime is a life saver they say. They love the way the cushions provide support for the baby. Was the carseat they used to leave the hospital in as well. Seems well built as I waited a good 5 months to write a review to see if they had any issues. None so far so I'm happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "We bought this after using our old car seat with our previous two kids. I am so glad we did because not only is it extremely easy to install, but it gives the best support for newborns. My little one is two mos old now and I love the padding for the head and the body. One thing that is also awesome is the sun shade cover. It goes very far down so it can be darker for baby to sleep. And it\u2019s a breathable material as well. Overall, we love this car seat. All, and I mean ALL of our baby car seats/strollers are graco brand. You can\u2019t beat the price and quality!",

                "reviewText": "This car seat I use to have for my first born but for my second born I had gotten Baby tread and I honestly regretted it. It was so hard to take out of its base and to put it in unlike this car seat. This car seat is very easy to install and I do not have difficulty taking out the car seat out of the base. It looks very comfortable for my newborn and it had lots of cushion around it which is something I was looking for. This car seat is exactly what I should have gotten for my second born, but since I was being cheap I got what I paid for. Don\u2019t let the price of this car seat scare you, it is worth it for your little one. I will be using this car seat for my third child with no regrets and knowing she will be protected and cushioned well. I am highly satisfied with this car seat. I would be recommending this to my sister in laws and my sister as well once they decide to have one of their own little ones. Highly recommend!!",
