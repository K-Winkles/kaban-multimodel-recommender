            "CHECK YOUR SEAT BELT BUCKLE BEFORE ORDERING: Please review the images that show where the Buckle Booster will fit and make sure your seat belt buckle is not too recessed. Also note that the inner dimensions are 1.93 inches x 1.06 inches and the material stretches a bit. No matter what, we'll still help with your order, but reviewing in advance is always best.",
            "BPA FREE - Perfect for adults and kids, this BPA-free Buckle Booster allows you to buckle up with just one hand, whether you are in a hurry or have mobility challenges. Are you post-surgery, have arthritis or simply unable to spare a hand for buckling? The Buckle Booster lets you buckle yourself and others. Keeping the receptacle stable, you just need to click the metal tongue into the receptacle and you're ready to go!",
            "BUCKLE WITH EASE - Do you get annoyed when trying to buckle others or yourself, because the seat belt receptacle is buried under your car seat? The Buckle Booster stabilizes your seat belt, so you can smoothly click the metal tongue in. No more wobbly belt that is hard to hold while buckling. No more buried receptacle hiding smugly under the seat or behind car and booster seats.",
            "RAISES YOUR RECEPTACLE - The trouble with buckling is not just inadequate space, it's also how far you have to reach for the buckle. The Buckle Booster elevates your seat belt receptacle so the metal tongue can click in smoothy and effortlessly. No more strain and struggle - buckle yourself and others quickly and without hassle!",
            "FOR ADULTS AND BOOSTER / CAR SEATS - Reaching from the side to buckle children is frustrating due to the elusive, floppy buckles that get buried under car seats. With three car or booster seats in the back, your buckling job is nearly impossible. With the Buckle Booster, made from BPA FREE materials, buckling loved ones in the back is easy! You can comfortably reach the receptacle between child restraints. Have one car seat or no car seat at all? Reaching the stable, elevated buckle is now easy!"
