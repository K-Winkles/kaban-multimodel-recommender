The compact size fits 3 seats across in most mid-size vehicles, while the wider seat base fits a broader range of children. With a weight rating of 65 lbs., and a rear-facing weight rating of 40 lbs., your child can stay rear-facing and harnessed longer. This seat offers a built-in ventilation system, helping to keep child comfortable during long and short trips. Dual, integrated cup holders keep snacks and drinks within reach, and the removable, machine-washable seat pad makes inevitable cleaning of the seat far easier. Evenflo car seats have been tested above and beyond industry standards and undergo our rigorous side impact and dynamic rollover tests. Additionally, all Evenflo seats include live video installation support, allowing you to schedule an appointment with a car seat technician, so you have the confidence that your seat is correctly installed. Evenflo Sonus 65 is designed, engineered, tested and assembled in the United States.",
