                "reviewText": "Purchased this carseat specifically to be our seat for traveling and we also use it as a back-up seat in if we have a guest who needs a seat. I was super impressed at how lightweight it is! We also purchased (separately) a travel car seat bag that you can wear as a backpack and just slip this seat in and wear it while walking through the airport. It\u2019s easy to transport and sturdy, and then super easy to install into any car or even the smallest of rentals or Ubers and it doesn\u2019t take up much space so you can also still fit 2 adults in the backseat of most standard vehicles plus this car seat.Wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend this seat to be your primary seat for everyday use at home or for a long road trip in your own vehicle due to it may not be the most comfortable seat (I.e. the seat back is very straight and it doesn\u2019t recline or anything fancy) BUT for taking along with you while traveling by air and then using it at your destination, you really can\u2019t beat this one! Plus the price is nice so if it gets broken or lost by the airline, it\u2019s not a huge loss. I recommend gate checking it though, less chance of it getting lost.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for a cross-country holiday trip by airplane. Our toddler (26 months) sat on this in his airplane seat - great for flights. Very light weight, fits through the Xray machine, slim enough to fit on one airplane seat without crowing anyone else, and more comfortable for our kid than trying to sit him on a plane seat built for adults. The car seat boosts him up, so he can see out the airplane window and he could also reach the tray table for snacks & his iPad. I highly recommend buying a car seat bag on Amazon so you can easily carry the car seat through the airport. Very easy to install in your car with the LATCH anchors.",

                "reviewText": "These car seats worked great for us. We bought 2 for our kids when traveling to Europe. Unfortunately the car seats got lost on the flight there, but whatever happened to them before we got them back (I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all heard horror stories of airport luggage handling\u2026), the car seats came to us unscathed and in perfect condition! (Do yourself a favor and buy a car seat travel bag!)Once we finally were able to use them, the installation was very easy and straightforward (read the instruction manual once) and the kids were very comfortable in the seats, even on 4 hour long drives.These car seats are very light weight- we had 2 in the same travel bag and it was easy to carry them and maneuver them. These seats are now in our second car as back up travel seats.Highly recommend!",

We needed a seat in our rental anyway and we figured he would be more comfortable on the plane as this was his first time.Things I liked: super lightweight. At first I thought it would be flimsy but it was good! I have some issues walking around and was worried it would be heavy to lug around, but it was fine considering going through customs was a chore. It is rather bulky. The planes we were on were TINY but it fit in the seat just fine. Kiddo was happy in it! And it worked perfectly in the car/ cars. It was super easy to install....but......Things I didn't like: ....... getting the belts to get through the back of the seat on the plane? Tough and I have tiny hands. My entire arm got bruised but that's not the seats fault! Once it was in, it was FINE. It was a pain to lug it around and next time we would gate check it. Also, the straps got super tangled because it was being moved around and by the time we got to our last flight, I was over it.Overall: GREAT for traveling and on the plane. Fits even the tiny seats and my kiddo was super happy in it. Loved how it was portable and YES! IT IS FAA APPROVED. We only had 2 times we were asked so he prepared to show it (the seat is labeled clearly on the back). Is this our go too? Nope. Is it a great second seat for other people who are watching him? Absolutely!!",

                "reviewText": "I'm expecting my third baby in April and was having a lot of trouble finding car seats that would fit in the back. 2 of these and a baby trend infant carseat fit perfectly in my 2016 Ford Focus hatchback. They definitely are snug, but they are installed safely. The only thing that's a little annoying is the slot in the back where you feed the seatbelt through to install is small. I have small hands and I still have trouble .",

                "reviewText": "We needed a \"slim\" car seat for our two kiddos. What we loved, the price, fit in our convertible and built in shoulder straps. Also when they grow past the.hihhest shoulder strap, then the cars seatbelt is introduced for longer use. One last thing, these things meet all safety standards AND are feather light. Moving car seats in and out of cars a few times a week makes all the difference when they are light in weight. Keep in mind the hook restraint system isn't as easy to attach/detach however most car seats still have them and aren't within the price range.Best bang for you buck!",

                "reviewText": "We purchased this seat as a backup carseat for my grandmother's car. It's light enough for grandmother to move it around with ease if needed and sleek enough to not take up a massive amount of room in her already small backseat. I love that it has the 5point safety harness and a cup holder and that you can alternate on either side. The padding is thin and i do wish it was thicker but for the 10minutes a day she is in it, it suffices. I do not believe it would be comfortable for long distance. All in all i believe it is a good purchase for the price",
