                "reviewText": "I am very happy with this carseat that we purchased about 6 months ago. I like that is not extra bulky so it doesn't take up extra space and 2 other passengers can sit in the back of the car next to the carseat, while the carseat is still wide enough that my 2 1/2 year old son can sit comfortably. It was a great price compared to anything else I saw, the look is nice, it was easy for my husband to install and it is easy to strap in my son. The only negative parts are: 1. that the cupholders are always falling out so we usually don't use them. 2. As the child grows you need to adjust the size of the staps and that is not as easy on this carseat as it was in our infant carseat.Overall would definately reccommend this carseat.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to use in my car for my 20 month old granddaughter that I keep every Friday. It was not any harder to install than any other car seat I have dealt with but it would not tighten enough to keep it from rocking no matter what I did. I tried the rolled up towel trick but that did not work either. My son even tried to tighten it. He ended up using the tether strap on the back of the carseat and hooking it to the front of the actual seat to keep it secured. This is in addition to using the hooks and the lap belt. I am sure it will be fine once we turn her forward facing. But I am disappointed in the fact that they advertised this one for both rear and forward facing.But the worst part aside from not fitting tight enough is the button on the 5 point harness is the most difficult button I have ever had to deal with! It takes me 3 or 4 tries and having to use all the force I have to get this button to release. I am concerned that this is a safety issue.The seat has a nice padded cushion and it looks comfortable. I also like the 2 cup holders. That is great for snacks on the road. It seems easy to clean also. I am so disappointed that it has been so difficult to install and the release button is such a pain.",
