                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best purchase ever. Period.",
                "reviewText": "Let me clearly state that this has been the best and most satisfying purchase I\u2019ve ever made in Amazon (and probably everywhere else). It arrived just the day the baby was born, and so we were able to come out of the hospital with the baby in it the next day. It was amazing having learned how to use it right away. We had a 15 minute walk from the hospital to our home and we chose to go that way instead of using a car. Since then we have been using the Doona every day and our baby has always felt comfy and happy when we seat him in it. It\u2019s very maneuverable and it has served its purpose for every use we have thought of for it. So here\u2019s a short summary of use cases we\u2019ve successfully checked:- Taking the baby to the restaurant for lunch and dinner: we have used it in car seat mode and kept him just by our side in long benches in restaurants or as a stroller (with the brakes on) and replacing a seat at the table with it. It\u2019s compact enough to avoid people getting in close proximity to its wheels, unlike most strollers.- Taking the baby on a ferry: Yes! It worked wonderfully in car seat mode for this. And the baby really likes traveling since his first day out (really thanks to the Doona... remember the baby adapts to your lifestyle instead of otherwise, if you choose to do so).- Using Uber: We\u2019ve taken the baby on more than 50 rides and all drivers -really, all of them- were impressed at how easy it was for us to get him in and out of the car, converting from stroller to car seat and back to stroller in an easy operation. Just tell your Uber they don\u2019t need to get off the car to open the trunk or help handling the stroller, because it\u2019s instantly a car seat. It has made our life out of home really easy.- Taking the baby to the beach: just convert to car seat and carry it with the handle and then pop out the wheels when you hit your palm tree spot. The integrated shade helps keep the baby comfortable but we go extra cautious and always put a blanket covering the top of the Doona so no mosquitoes or too much sun and wind gets in. There\u2019s an official sunshade but we found it easy to go the cheap way since we didn\u2019t get the sunshade along and didn\u2019t want to wait for shipping times.- Taking the baby to the movies: Yes! Believe it or not, babies like Avengers even if it\u2019s a three hour long movie. We just put the Doona in car seat mode and voil\u00e0! Just check the baby for signs of wet diaper and maybe go to change it once through the movie to avoid crying. Remember to seat close to the aisles or next to the handicapped seats and you\u2019ll enjoy your movie date once again and not having to wait for years to go back to the cinema. Actually having done this helped us emotionally since we found out we still can do things we like.- Taking the baby on a plane: Oh, yes... we had an international flight at week 5 and we felt like a \u201cmoving Kodak picture spot/opportunity\u201d everywhere through the airport. It was so easy to get to narrow or crowded places and there are two ways of traveling with it: 1. Taking it to the gate and unloading the baby right at the plane\u2019s door and the airline will take care of it and put it with the cargo and then deliver it back when you get out of the door so you can keep using it through customs and luggage pick up without having to hold the baby the whole time. And... 2. Getting a seat for your baby that you can take the Doona on board because it\u2019s certified for air travel... We chose option 1 and saved some money for diapers and baby formula. And it was by far the easiest to use stroller/seat we saw (and the airline staff said that too). There were other babies on both planes we took and honestly they weren\u2019t having as good time as we were.- Taking the car seat through TSA check... easy... it goes through the X-ray machine in car seat mode, flipped upside down. Just the right size for that.- Taking the baby to doctor\u2019s appointments: waiting rooms sometimes get crowded and we were happy our Doona didn\u2019t take as much space, avoiding making other people uncomfortable. During an appointment I found out another \u201cmode\u201d for the Doona that I\u2019ve never seen in reviews or elsewhere: just retract the wheels to put it in car seat mode and leave it in the floor. Surprisingly, it works like a rocking chair! Really, just try it when you get yours and be amazed at that \u201crocking chair\u201d mode. I\u2019ve never seen so many \u201cWTF\u201d faces around before.- Getting in and out of elevators with one hand: just retract the handle and put it upright and it will take the less space possible. It\u2019s so easy to do.- Going shopping: it\u2019s so small and flexible you can take it to the outlets and feel like a \u201cKodak picture spot/opportunity\u201d once again (actually someone mentioned that while I retracted the Doona to climb some stairs and avoiding a long ramp other parents where going through slowly (hence the photo op... a line of parents wasting time and only one avoiding the traffic jam).Now we\u2019re in month 5 and while most of this review was written during the first two months, nothing has changed and we\u2019re happy we went the Doona way. We removed the newborn insert just before month 3 and baby didn\u2019t even notice the change.Short summary: we have been happy parents thanks to Doona.***********Follow up: Our baby is 2.5 years old now and we miss the Doona. We used it for 15 months and once again, we miss it but it surely made another happy family after us. If there could be something similar for toddlers, we would definitely buy it. But honestly, still think it was the best purchase ever.",

                "reviewText": "We love our Doona. It's compact and easy to use once you get the hang of it. Fits great in our 4Runner, the door doesn't open all the way so it's a tad snug to get it in and out but light enough to do so. The ability to fold is SO COOL. We amaze people all the time when we take it out. and fold/unfold the wheels. We try to avoid taking it on walks to keep the tires from getting too worn but have gone down the street a ways with no issues. I am 5'11 and don't have a problem pushing it. It would be nice if it were a bit taller, but not bad enough to call it a negative. My 6'3 husband has no issues pushing it either. It's also such an attractive item. Only real negative is you can't carry anything else on it. There is a pack you can buy that guess under the seat I believe but you cannot hang anything from the handle without it wanting to fall towards you.",

                "reviewText": "I have significant arthritis in my feet which would make carrying an infant car seat really difficult because of the extra weight. I absolutely love the Doona. It is easy to fold and even easier to unfold. It pops out of the base easily and isn\u2019t overly heavy. The actual car seat structure is fantastic and feels really secure. There is no storage- but there is great options to add on (the knock offs work GREAT!)I\u2019m 5\u20198 and the height isn\u2019t an issue for me. My husband is over 6 foot and doesn\u2019t mind it. The handle does have to be in a specific position in order to get it to fold so the first few times were difficult but after you have folded and unfolded a handful of times, it feels really easy, even when you have a baby in it. because of the bulk of the wheels when it\u2019s folded, it can be a little bit cumbersome to get it in the car or out of the car but it\u2019s a small price to pay for the convenience and portability overall. The only other negative would be that if the wheels get dirty of the stroller than it will obviously get your car dirty. You can buy protectors. This isn\u2019t a big deal for us but I could see how it might be a problem for others.One thing I would consider, if you are having a C-section consider the wait restrictions during recovery. You may need assistance getting it in and out of the car in the mediate postpartum period during dr visits, etc. I just took my kiddo out instead of unfolding the entire stroller.The stroller maneuvers really well and does great in tight spaces. It\u2019s worth every penny.",
