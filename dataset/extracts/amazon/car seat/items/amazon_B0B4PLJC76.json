                "reviewText": "We Love this seat. I was a skeptical because my baby, a year old had not slept on a ride in the car, only cried almost every single minute of the car ride. Now we\u2019ve had this seat a few days shy of a month. Since day one, THE VERY FIRST ride in this seat and she slept in the car, no fussing, not a tear shed. Every single ride since she has fallen asleep, no fussing, just babbling and comfortable\u2026and that\u2019s even with it being a hotttt summer in Minnesota, no air conditioning in the car as it just went out and not an easy fix/needs replacing. Baby is still happy!! And I\u2019m so happy I bought this seat. I bought a color that was a little less expensive in the selection but in the car seat brand selection this one was a little pricier\u2026 I am glad I gave it a try as the return window with this company allowed for a good run to see how it performed. We will be keeping this seat and would re-purchase again and again. This is my third child, each child has hated the car. Now I think it was the issue of the sear as the problem and not the actual riding in the car. Also, we are still rear facing so it wasn\u2019t the fact that baby had been turned forward, as to the fix in crying spells. I have two boys and a girl now\u2026 they all hated the car. They all have been nursed exclusively and attached to mama so, I thought that had something to do with it but now I feel like the comfort in this Maxi Cosi car seat must be like mama\u2019s arms or even being held in the carrier/similar feel. The straps are just better placement around the shoulder and thigh. The head rest holds well while little one is riding/resting. The magnetic chest clip is superior!! The way the shoulder straps hold up and the way they are formed and how it lays on the collar/chest is way more comfortable for baby. She literally smiles and chats when I say \u201clet\u2019s go on a car ride!\u201d And she happily loads in while I clip the straps in place. It\u2019s really amazing. I don\u2019t leave reviews for products purchased ever but I felt led to do this one with other struggling parents in mind. It really is almost too good to be true but I\u2019ll gladly take it!! Life is better with this seat!! We actually love the blue color too!! Looks so nice and worth the price!!Last note is that it\u2019s an easy seat to put in the car, easy to adjust headrest/back of the seat. Perfect right out of the box!I hope this helps someone!",

Easy fasten and release. No more aching fingers lol! Only thing that takes some finagling is finding the right positioning for the between the leg buckles. They protrude a little and can press into your little ones leg. It didn\u2019t seem to bother her too much unless she was cranky. Utilizing the little cushion that goes around the buckle is helpful. Overall, it is extremely comfortable for her and would definitely recommend.",

I love the magnetic latch system across the chest. My only complaint is that the straps are harder to tighten than in most car seats I have used. I end up tightening them by pulling them manually behind the shoulder area of the car seat, then pulling on the strap to pull in the slack.",

It seemed to get looser as we rode. I tried buckling my child in after 2-3 rides, and looked back and the bottom buckle had come undone. Pulled over to correct it and it wouldn\u2019t catch and stay buckled. So so so so unsafe. And not worth the money. Also, I\u2019m pretty sure they are going to pay me to send the seat back to them. The quality in these seats are so far down, and it\u2019s so sad. It used to be a great brand. Will not be purchasing anything else from this brand or company.",

                "reviewText": "Car seats have come a LONG way since I was a young mom. The Maxi Cosi infant seat impressed me and this Pria convertible seat is also a cut above. I LOVE the straps slightly \"pushing forward\" or elevated with the cushions on the straps and definitely makes sitting a toddler in the seat and strapping in much easier. Perhaps with wear & tear the straps will lay flatter yet the small cream-colored oval strap \"catch\" also helps. See pics to understand. I thought they were magnetic when purchasing; however, they just allow the adult to lift & \"catch\" the strap out of the way for the next entry. The male end of the metal buckle can be tucked above or left to fall below the \"catch\" yet re-entry is easier if you remember to catch the buckle too instead of needing to fish out from behind the tot. Also, if you push the female end of the buckle down, it will also be more accessible when putting the tot back in the seat. If not, you will fish between the legs of the child for that like all other seats I've used.Lastly, my grandson is long & lean so the easier height adjustment is a bonus. Good luck trying to adjust WITH the child secured though! This was purchased for a grandchild and installed with the mom's help thankfully because we did need to re-feed the straps for a 20 mo old vs a rear-facing infant.",
