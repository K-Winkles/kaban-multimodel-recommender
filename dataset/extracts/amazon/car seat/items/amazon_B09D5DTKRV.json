Seat never appears crumby and repulsive. Easy seatbelt entrance and exit. Simple pull out under tray to lock back pieces into vehicle. One quick tilt to the side and tug to black strap to remove back from detachable seat. This seat costs what it does because it\u2019s a creature of convenience and careful parent\u2019s dream.",

I have not tried the others but it is not that expensive considering my daughter is going to use this booster for next fee years.Sturdy and dutable as always.Easy to install.Backrest is removable as we need.Spill proof fabric for easy wipe off to clean.Armrest does not interfere while my kid put on/off seat belt.Light weight compare to foonf. ( foonf is heavy..)And my daughter feels comfortable and confidence.As mentioned, price is bit high compare to many others but if I break the price down with the length of time this seat will serve my kids, it is not too high for me to invest.Do I recommend this? Yes.Is it much better than the others? I don\u2019t think so.",
