Yet, here we are.I originally bought a Safety 1st booster seat because it was inexpensive, but was woefully disappointed in the quality. You get what you pay for indeed. This Graco seat is very sturdy, not terribly difficult to install, and gives great peace of mind.We already had two Graco 4Ever DLX 4-in-1 car seats and were very happy with them. They are bulky, though. This slim one is definitely smaller and takes up less space. I ended up keeping this one since I have a smaller SUV (Chevy Equinox) and gave the bulky DLX to the in-laws since they have a bigger vehicle.My kiddo LOVES being able to climb up in the seat without assistance and the collapsible cup holders ended up being a bonus toy to play with on car rides.This thing is just plain solid. Great construction and materials. The head rest and straps are easy to adjust as well (we\u2019re using it in forward facing 5-point harness mode). This one is well worth the investment.",

                "reviewText": "Ok. So please forgive all of the pictures but when I was looking for new car seats seeing actual comparison pictures really helped me make my decision. We are upgrading from the Graco extend2fit car seat. I drive a 2015 Subaru crosstrek, the smallest of the Subaru crossover line. Middle seat room is important as there is a teenager in our house that sometimes needs to sit in the back for ull family outings (if I could do it all again, I would have just bought the minivan that I swore up and down we didn\u2019t need and I didn\u2019t want)Anyway, comparing the two seats side by side, you can see the the extend2fit sits on a bit of a higher base. The lack of armrest and the flip out cup holders do make the seat a bit slimmer on the slimfit. The back and headrest are similar on both seats but a difference that was noticable is the the back of the slimfit is a solid panel as opposed to the extend2fit with an open back. This difference is mearly cosmetic and they are both functional.The recline option is the same, the padding is the same, the wonderful sliding headrest to adjust height is the same (this is also my most favorite option on the Graco seats)The seat looks comfortable, the install for rear facing was straight forward; forward facing you have to remove the latch and slide it through the rear pass (didn\u2019t know that, called Graco and a tech walked me through it) I did get my hand fully stuck trying to get the latch through the rear pass but that\u2019s water under the bridge at this point.The seat seems a bit lighter than the extend2fit but this is a heavy seat, this is not a great choice if you move car seats on a regular basis or want to lug it through the airport.I love that all of the padding is removable and machine washable, I don\u2019t love that without the infant seat insert there are a ton of cracks and slips through the fabric for animal crackers and gummy snacks to migrate to.All in all, this is a sturdy, well built seat that does become a booster (which is a bonus that I won\u2019t need another car seat for the kids down the road)TL;DRThe seat doesn\u2019t seem much smaller than extend2fit but it\u2019s nice. Installation was ok. 10/10 would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this to replace the current car seat for my 2.5 years old. This slim-fit version from Graco definitely is worth the extra money. Asides from the package being damaged, which isn't Amazon fault, the carseat is perfect! When I said it's perfect, i really meant it. When taking the carseat out out the box, all the necessities come together, from the instruction manual to warranty booklet. It's light, compact and handy that one can easy lift with one hand without sacrifing the sturdiness and the protectioness of a carseat. My older carseat come with so many small things (from the cup holders, straps, etc.) that fall apart as soon as I took it out. Additional, the carseat has the built-in bubble levels with different angles, making it so easy for installation. There's nothing to complain about for this carseat. Would buy again if the price drops.",
