                "reviewText": "First, I want to address the reviews stating that the latch to rotate the car seat is getting \"stuck\". I, too, though it was getting stuck at first and was so disappointed! However, after messing with it more, you will come to realize it is not getting stuck at all. You have to press all your fingers down with equal pressure on the latch for it to actually let the car seat turn. If you do this, it will work every time. To me, this is a safety feature! If you have had your eye on this car seat, do not be discouraged by the feedback saying the turning mechanism gets stuck; it does not. My only feedback would be putting somewhere in the manual a little note to let parents know that you really have to apply pressure to the entire latch for it to engage. My son is so comfy in it he falls asleep within minutes! I have been a faithful Maxi-Cosi customer, and I am so happy with this car seat!",

So much easier strapping a baby .",

                "reviewText": "I'm very disappointed with this thing. It is VERY difficult to install. The seat portion is attached with a steel cable to the base which makes it get in the way of installing. You can't really get it out of the way. It keeps flopping over or pulling the base away when you are trying to install it. There is no documentation how to clip the latches onto the car fixing points. Do they go opening up or opening down ? The strap that goes over the car seat to the back anchor is shown to go between the headrest supports. What if the car has unmovable headrests ? the strap has to go around and tugs the whole thing lopsided. That back strap should be split so it can accommodate cars with fixed headrests. Tightening the straps is also a nightmare. you tighten tighten tighten and it's still a floppy construction. there is no way to adjust the base incline. Ever seen an isofix mechanism ? one click and it's done ! no belts, no straps no fuss.Then there is the whole seat itself. The manual points to the handles on the SIDE to change the incline in rear facing mode. The real latch is in the BACK of the seat. It took me 10 minutes to figure this out. Learn to draw instructions ! The drawing is misleading. The straps for the child have a sticky backing that makes it difficult to get her in properly. The seat is not removable from the base so you can't use it as a child carrier and need to move it to a different carrier.( yet another purchase and cost). The handle to unlatch the rotation is very stiff and in a difficult to reach position. This thing doesn't work. It took us 20 minutes to get the newborn in the set when trying to leave the hospital. The hospital almost did not let us go because we don't have a baby carrier to take her from the room to the car seat (other systems have the seat removable to be used as baby carrier.) Moving this from one car to another is an ordeal. The rotation is a gimmick. It may work in a tall wide SUV with large door opening, in a regular sedan ? not so much. VERY displeased.",

                "reviewText": "We were super excited to find a rotating car seat that had everything we wanted. It had adjustable, cupholders and places to put the straps to keep them out of place. It also rotated, which is huge plus. The car seat is very aesthetically, pleasing and super cushioning.However, there were too many drawbacks. The first thing we noticed was the rotation was really challenging. You had to use two hands, and it often got stuck. While trying to get a good fit on our infant, we noticed a few other downfalls. The straps constantly got tangled and it was a pain to untangle them. Also, there was no way to adjust the crotch buckle. Which made it impossible to get a good fit on our infant. Once the seat was buckled the straps, squeezed his legs and made him very uncomfortable. Per the manual you cannot take out the extra support pillows until kiddo is 30 pounds, so this wasn\u2019t an option to get a better fit. Lastly, the shoulder strap cushions are not removable. They are sewn onto the straps and are very long. In order for us to get a good fit on our little guy we needed to be able to take those off and we weren\u2019t able to. The buttons were also hard to push. This could be because it was a brand new seat. However, there were too many flaws for us to keep the seat. Definitely not worth the money!",

It is heavy - way heavier than any other car seat we\u2019ve owned, so my husband helped with lifting. But once it\u2019s in, it\u2019s easy to install. A simple weave of the seatbelt and latch. I also have no trouble rotating it. Sometime it can be finicky and you have to get a little momentum to get a good spin, but it\u2019s not a problem and totally worth buying!",

We were so thankful when he was able to pull himself up because we didn\u2019t have to lift him.My husband decided to get this for our second and said it is a life changing! The lift is very minimal because you are not having to turn the baby to face the back and even when your baby is using it as front facing, it\u2019s just that much easier to place your baby inside the car seat.He also mentioned that it comes with many level of elevation, which is very good for the baby as they get older. Able to adjust the elevation as they get older. Totally worth the $$$$$",
