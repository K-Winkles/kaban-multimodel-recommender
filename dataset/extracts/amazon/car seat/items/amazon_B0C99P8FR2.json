                "reviewText": "Pros: This carseat is AMAZINGLY slim while not trading out any of the comfort. The cup holder is spacious yet sturdy and allows for even wider based sippy cups to fit. My little one loves this seat. The color is absolutely gorgeous, however, it is more of a lilac than a pink.Cons: installation is a bit extreme. It does not work well with small SUV seats, the Nissan Kicks angled back seats don't allow for it to sit well without a towel or noodle in the crack for toddler's to rear face. It took almost an hour of trying various things and adjustments to get the seat to sit correctly both level and stable. The flip foot is stupid, it is either sitting straight up for front facing or it's laying WAY down for newborn rear facing. The seat has the level indicators for infant and toddler rear facing, but the foot doesn't really allow you to use them. It could not be done without using something to prop the seat up level, which is frustrating. But, in the end we used a noodle and were able to get the proper install angle and the stability a carseat should have.",

                "reviewText": "I mean, it's okay I guess. I like the color. The seat is very basic, but you get what you pay for. I needed to fit a booster seat, infant seat, and carseat in the back of a Honda CRV. The carseat had to be as narrow as possible and all the other comparable options were well out of my price range. For $89, this was definitely budget friendly, especially considering that the infant would eventually grow out of the infant seat and I would need to have two carseats that were narrow enough to fit in the back seat with a booster. This seat is around 17 inches wide, which fit the bill perfectly.Being at the price-point that it is, it doesn't really come with any bells and whistles. You need to manually re-thread the harness as the baby grows, which is a pain if you don't want to take the seat out of your car to do so. It wasn't awful to install, but we also had a CPST certified installer at a local fire station help us out with it.My biggest problem with it is that it seems one strap is ALWAYS longer than the other and at times I worry that I can't pull both straps tight enough because of this. The straps are also constantly getting twisted as well. When we were still getting used to the seat, my then one year old baby was able to wiggle her arms out on a couple of occasions. I love seeing her happy, smiling face...but not when it's looking at me in my rearview mirror! So you really have to be careful with these straps and ensuring that they're actually tight enough, which, as I stated before, is difficult because one seems longer than the other. We manage to make it work, but it takes a lot of fiddling to make them even and it's just so much more of a headache than it needs to be.",
