It starts by keeping kids securely in a 5-point safety harness all the way up to 65 pounds. In its second mode, as a belt-positioning booster, it has them covered up to 100 pounds. In both modes, the deluxe fabric gives kids a comfy ride. In both modes, the Finale DX Booster Car Seat is lightweight and easy to move from car to car which is excellent for families who are always on the go. It also easily fits 3 across in the back seat of most vehicles making it a smart choice for growing families with multiple kids in car seats at once. With kids in the car, messes happen. But thanks to the easy-to-clean car seat pad, there's no need to stress. The pad removes from the seat and is both machine washable and dryer safe, so a thorough wash is just a machine cycle away.",

                "reviewText": "We originally got this for our backup seat so we could have a slimmer option to put 3 across in our 3rd row for when a grandparent was riding along with us. It has turned into our daily seat as we now need 3 across for the foreseeable future. It has been a great seat! Actually my 4 year old prefers it to his other bigger seat. It is a no frills seat so there aren't a lot of the nicer options that I prefer in my seats (lockoffs, premium latch connectors, no rethread harness, etc.) but it is perfect for us right now as we need a narrow seat. And for those who need a budget friendly seat that will keep their kiddo harnessed until age 6, this is a great option! My only beef with it is that the tether slowly comes loose (not fully loose just not super tight) in time. Probably once a month I have to tighten it again but it hasn't been an issue as we are in the trunk often loading strollers or groceries so I just give it yank and tighten it back up.This setup I have is a Britax Allegiance, Cosco Topside, and Cosco Finale in the 3rd row of my Honda Odyssey.",

                "reviewText": "my 3 year old fits great, its easy to move around, easy to install, feels safe / decent, and I don't have to ever buy another car seat to replace this one. I got this one for husbands car, he doesn't take our kids as often but one day we forgot to move our sons car seat out of husbands car to my car and he was at work and unreachable and I had to go pick up my kids from school but I had no car seat to be able to put our son in. It was not great trying to search my garage only to find nothing to be able to bring my son in the car to get my older kids from school. Lots of panic and other accommodations had to be made to get my kids home from school, and never want to have to go through that again. Another huge bonus is that this carseat is slim, so now it stays in husbands mini so our kids aren't squished in the back seat like they are with our regular car seat.",

                "reviewText": "I have to leave a review for this product because I'm so so happy with the results. I have a 2010 Corolla and was pretty sure we'd need another big vehicle to allow 3 carseats (2 boosters and an infant carseat). I researched like crazy, these had great reviews for the price, and lo and behold..they fit. It is snug, for sure! But they fit and I could secure each seat very tightly and safely. I can't decide if I'll have baby in middle or on the side, but both arrangements fit. The car is not our go-to family car, so we don't envision long trips with the kids in these seats, but we now have peace of mind knowing if the parent who has the car that day needs to go to store / drop off at daycare / etc with all 3 kids, we can now do it. So relieved!Sidenote: also love the fact that you can use the 5 point harness until 65 lbs. We will assess what to do when our 5 year old (40 lbs currently) gets to that point and would need to buckle in. Buckling in would be very challenging. 5 point harness was necessary for this to fit.",
