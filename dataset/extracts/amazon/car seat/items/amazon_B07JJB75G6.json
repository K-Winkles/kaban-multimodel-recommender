I still have him in a 5 point harness and the button on the belt release is really hard for him to push just right. This handy invention really does allow him to push the button easily and unbuckle when safe to do so. I can also see why this would be a great tool to have for adults lacking in hand strength. The plastic seems sturdy to accommodate what it's intended to do. If you have two vehicles with a car seat in both, I'd recommend having one in each car.",
