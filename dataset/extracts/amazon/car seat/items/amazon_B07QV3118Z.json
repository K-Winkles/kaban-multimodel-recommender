                "reviewText": "Great car seat! The cover comes off on sections and is easy to take off and button or clip back on for cleaning. If there's only a mess on some of the car seat you don't have to take the whole thing off so that's def a plus! Easy to install. Cup holder can go on either side and my 2 year old can reach it. Everything is easy to adjust regarding seatbelts, buckle straps, and height adjustment. I really have nothing negative to say about it and I've had it for a good 3 months, using it rear facing and forward facing. Which I should add that I loved how I could keep my 2 year old rear facing as long as I did. It definitely put me at ease. You'd think that their legs wouldn't have room and that you'd have to put them forward facing, but after doing research on it I found out that they'll just figure out a way to make themselves comfortable (which is easy in this spacious seat). It's still safer having them rear facing as long as they meet the seat requirements!",

                "reviewText": "Bought this seat for our growing grandson. Initially installed it rear facing. The adjustment strap however was impassible to get to. This was totally unlike the dedicated rear facing seat we bought of the same brand. Forward facing it is still difficult, but manageable. If the adjustment was more user friendly, it would be perfect.",

                "reviewText": "EDITED! The car seat is comfortable and safe for my little Bud. One challenge is that it doesn\u2019t level properly without a towel under it in my Audi Q7. (The directions suggest to use a towel...) So it wasn\u2019t as easy to install as the Chicco base, and I really wish I\u2019d gone with another Chicco, but this will do especially because of the cost of buying two. I do really like the ease of raising the headrest and subsequently the harness straps (no refeeding through awkward tiny slots). There is a challenge in my husbands truck. The mechanism for loosening the harness is near impossible to get to because of the angle of the backseats and the placement of the button. Bud feels cool in his car seat and that\u2019s important. NEW INFO: we have since added twins to our family, and this seat has now gone front facing. Still love it. It fits well with two Chiccos next to it. I have no idea how it will all fit once the babies outgrow their infant carriers!",

This definitely isn\u2019t as easy to put in as other car seats we have, it takes some real strength to tighten the strap for the latch hooks when installing which is frustrating. It is a bit bigger than I was expecting, but otherwise its comfortable for my 9 month old who sits rear facing and I know they are safe which is all that matters!",
