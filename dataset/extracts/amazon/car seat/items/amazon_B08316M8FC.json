                "reviewText": "So I will start this by saying this is for my daughter, which is my first kid. So this is the very first time I have changed my kid from a 5 point harness car seat to a high back booster seat. I was excited to make the switch. But I was not prepared. So we got it delivered, and I watched my husband put it together, which was very easy. And then he struggled figuring out how to put the padding on, so I took over and did that part. The first thing I noticed is how flimsy it is. But didn\u2019t want to judge it until it was all the way out together. So I got the padding all on and in place, then had my daughter come sit in it (in the livingroom) so I could she how she looked in it. As soon as she sat down I had to have her get up and sit it against the wall so she could sit in. It, because again, it was VERY flimsy. I told my husband I wasn\u2019t sure about it, that yeah, the lightweight-ness of it is nice if you are switching between cars or will be taking it in and out of the car. But I rather it be heavy & feel more solid/stable/durable than I care about the weight of the seat. So the next day, we took it out to the car to get it in & ready to leave for an appointment. I did not prepare myself from going from a seat that is anchored in, and a 5 point harness around my kid, holding her in place and felt very secure and protected, to her basically just having a regular seat belt & that\u2019s it. So the shock of that, making me feel like something wasn\u2019t right, that she needed to be hooked in more/better, made me dislike it even more. Now if it anchored into the car, that may help my dislike, or if it were a heavier less flimsy seat, that may change my dislike for it. I had this one and a graco seat picked out, & let my daughter pick between the two. She picked the \u201cpink\u201d one. The graco one was just black grey & white so I assumed she\u2019d like the one with colors on it. Now for my moms car (she babysits) I picked the graco seat. And I 100% regret getting this one as the Graco seat is much better quality I feel. Again, the seat may be perfect for someone else, this is just how it felt and is for me. & I\u2019m a Graco mama at heart, so I am a little biased. As far as being a high back booster seat, as far as making my child the correct height and position for the seat belt, it does it\u2019s job there. I just hope that until I am able to order the graco seat, we are not involved in any wrecks to truly put it to the test. Because I\u2019m not to confident in it. In the meantime, we just haven\u2019t been going anywhere unless absolutely necessary due to this.",

                "reviewText": "When I first put it in my car for my great grandson, we had the back on. He asked to have the back removed because he said it hurt his stomach where the belt laid across it with the back on. I do think it's safer with the back on, since it would protect the head much better. Regardless, it's easy for the kids to sit down and strap in. The car seat was easy to put together. It was also easy to adjust the back to have the head positioned where you need it. It's also easy to take the back off and put it back on if wanted.",
