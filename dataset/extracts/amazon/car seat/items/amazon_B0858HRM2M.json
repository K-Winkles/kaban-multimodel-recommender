                "reviewText": "We tried several boosters and this was the one we ended up with. Tried the Clek booster, Maxi Cosi, over priced Volvo booster, Graco, and Diono boosters. Diono was hard and too wide on top for three across. The top corners of the head rest made it very difficult to close the door in my 2020 xc90. Graco is narrow in the shoulder area. Liked the Clek booster but the seat has crazy hard cushion and the worse part was the height of the back of the seat. Height of the seat reached under my son\u2019s mid back and the seat bottom was under his mid thigh. My son could not stand it. It\u2019s very simple, sleek and stylish but maybe not the most comfortable for my son at least. Great rigid latch system on the Clek but my son literally asked me to send it back after our test ride in it. My son liked the Maxi Cosi. The cushion was very comfortable but like the Graco we tried, it restricted his arm movements as the shoulder width was narrow. The Volvo seat is not worth mentioning. What a piece of crap! Literally was like taking some hard plastic and covering in a few spots of leather. You might think that being expensive and a car with great safety specs, they might create an innovative and safe seat. Yeah, about that...Hard, uncomfortable, no latch, useless and over $400 for some piece of garbage. For us, the seats all fell short in one or another area.My 7 year old loves everything about this seat. Easy to use the rigid latch, color is nice, cushion is comfy and easy to clean (fabric zips off) no complaints. He has good arm space and his legs have good seat support underneath. Just happy to have finally found a good, comfortable booster seat without any extra complaints from my gremlin passengers.",

Saw other reviews that commented on it being challenging with the seatbelt to buckle. I have a Land Rover and the seatbelt buckles easily. Put the cupholder on the inside side of the seat, otherwise it banks up right against the door. Great quality and functionality - easy to adjust to the right height for my son.",

                "reviewText": "Like Meghan Trainor said... It's all about the base! Haha!The seat has a wide base; yet fits in individual bench or bucket seating in car or van. Great for older kids who you would still like to ride in a booster seat with 'side wings' for head protection. My 7-year-old rides in this seat.Neoprene-type fabric (like a wet suit) for the seat is great for wiping off spills and crumbs and is removable by a zipper. Does not snag at all and the seat is very smooth. Great design!The cup holder is removable. Yay!I wish that the back of the seat had the option to be removed vs being one solid piece to increase the longevity of the product use due to age of the person sitting in the seat. However, the wide base and fabric ( I bought the black one) overrode the inability to have a removable back to the base, because I know it would hold up from the car seat being used and passed down from one kid to the next.",

Positives- bottom seat belt guide, wide side wings, extra impact pods, entire back moves up with headrest, keeps kids in a high back until height is reached for belt only, lovely teal color, zip removable seat cover, easy remove belt guide cover, no crevices to collect crumbs... and the rigid latch is an absolute game changer!! Seriously the easiest seat I\u2019ve ever installed because of the rigid latch! The child loves it, too! My only negatives- can\u2019t figure out how to remove back cover and cup holder won\u2019t click into place, but I really didn\u2019t spend that much time working on those things because they weren\u2019t as important to me . I would buy it over again and recommend it a million times for the safety features and sturdiness!!",
