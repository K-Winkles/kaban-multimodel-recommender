As the carseat is designed for a wide range of ages, I did insert a carseat pillow in order to make it more comfortable for my daughter as she is petite.

It\u2019s super lightweight so it was easy to carry through the airport, easy to install in the rental car and my son seemed comfortable in it throughout the trip. Will also double as a backup for the grandparents when they watch him! Definite must for travel with small kiddos!",
