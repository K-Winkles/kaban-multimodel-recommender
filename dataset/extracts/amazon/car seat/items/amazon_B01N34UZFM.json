                "reviewText": "I own a small 5 passenger SUV and have a 3 year old toddler who is 42 inches tall. We had previously purchased the Graco Nautilus thinking this would be our final car-seat. The moment we began to use that car-seat, whenever my son would fall asleep in the car, his head would fall forward to his chest. This would really irk me as it looked so uncomfortable. I began to research once again and stumbled upon the SONuS -- it meets our needs! We love it and my son is much more comfortable when napping. I have just added cushioned pads to his straps and we're set. One CON: the middle seat belt clasp that is supposed to hit at the armpit does not slide up and down so gently when I am wanting to readjust it on my toddler's body, but this could just be my product, and likely not such a major con.",

Daughter grew right out of the britax we had, and we spent so much on that infant seat we decided to go with something more economical this time around. She loves the extra space and the cup holders are convenient. It does have a couple of downsides, though. It is much better forward facing. It isn't as secure when rear facing because the top cannot anchor unless you wrap the top strap around the passenger seat. It was also an absolute bear to install - I scuffed and bruised my hands trying to get the strap through the back, and it is hard to secure it tightly.",

I did research on how to work it and if I needed to get a new one. Turns out it\u2019s safe and is work-able once the continuous strap was explained to me and I moved the crotch buckle up. I\u2019m still struggling to get the prefect harness fit for my 3 year old but it is growing on me. I haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019m going to get one that isn\u2019t a science project or not just yet. The price is good and from what I can tell it is safe, so I wouldn\u2019t say don\u2019t buy it.

This is probably the best budget option out there. We use in grandma's car and it's much much better than the cosco scenera which was a bit cheaper but uncomfortable for our large baby.",

The reason why I put 4 stars is because if my son falls asleep in the car seat, his head flops around and ends up resting awkwardly on his chest/shoulder somehow, which is not a safe position for breathing. Luckily it does not happen often and I will not allow him to sleep in the car seat!",

I love that when it is cold the seat is not affected. The seat is well positioned that my baby's head can lean with comfort rather than nodding into an uncomfortable position. Easy to buckle my baby in, much quicker than our old peg perago. Also pretty light, I was able to install and carry the seat without my husband's help.",

Now the reality is we never use the back seat as it is not very large but the child seats fit beautifully and the kids love riding in the big yellow car. As you can see from the picture they fit like a charm and look great. Finally a use for the back seat of a sports car. :-)",
