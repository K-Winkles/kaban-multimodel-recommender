This seat is perfect : it\u2019s wide enough he can sit comfortably, it has him up a bit higher the his last so the seat belt sits correctly and it has a slight incline towards the back of the seat so he can sit and relax.It has a wonder latch system that was easy to install in just seconds. It is also easy to uninstall and move for car to car. It\u2019s light weight and easy to clean!This is and over all amazing car seat it is sturdy enough for our bigger kiddos for sure!",

                "reviewText": "The two pack was great as we have 2 cars. These are higher up than most seats which helps little one to see forward past a passenger which helps with motion sickness. Really comfortable seat compared to less expensive versions and the cloth is really nice quality. The cheaper seat we had would catch easy on everything - not this new seat! It cleans really easy too. The wider seat stays put in my car even without the latch system. Love the double cup holders and snack area. I can even have them both open cupholders when the seat is next to the door (which i wasnt sure I could do). The 2pack is a bargain and these are nicely built boosters!",

                "reviewText": "So my little girl who is nine is on the petite side for sure, and did not want a high back booster anymore. I confirmed with the pediatrician that it was OK to switch over because I\u2019m always airing on the side of caution. I am a nurse, what can I say? I was a little skeptical because I wasn\u2019t sure how it would fit, and if it would be comfortable based on a couple of the conflicting reviews but I have to tell you that I am so impressed! I am fully confident in the safety and love how comfortable it is for my daughter! It has a removable cover if we need to wash it. I also love the cupholders as an added bonus. I have a 2018 Toyota forerunner and it fits perfectly in the back. It also fits perfectly in my husbands GMC truck. I have not tried it out on a smaller vehicle but I don\u2019t think it would be a huge difference as far as the fit is concerned I actually think I\u2019m going to buy another one to put in Grandma\u2019s Honda. I definitely did my research, and I am very happy with my purchase, and my being reluctance to change from a high-back booster to just a booster, was eased with this purchase. If you were on the fence like I was, I can tell you that you just have to think of it like this, it\u2019s Amazon, if you don\u2019t like it, or it doesn\u2019t fit, just return it!",

He was thrilled with how it looked.The booster itself is lightweight for its size and yet feels sturdy and high quality.If you have used LATCH anchors before, installation will be a breeze. If you haven't used them before, it will still be a breeze. Removal is also a simple process.The only watch out is this is a large booster seat. We cannot use it in our small hatchback bc the unit impedes the seatbelt from connecting properly.This booster should fit comfortably, however, in any sedan and easily in any SUV (we have it installed in our compact SUV).Overall, a solid purchase that we are happy with!",
