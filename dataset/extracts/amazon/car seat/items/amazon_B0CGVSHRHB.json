        "description": "Graco Affix Highback Booster Seat with Latch System, AtomicThe Graco Affix highback Booster Seat with Latch System helps safely transport your big kid from 40 to 100 lb and up to 57\" tall. It provides a secure connection to your vehicle seat with its one-hand front-adjust Latch system, making self-buckling easier for your independent child. While the purpose of the Latch in the Affix Booster is to secure the booster to the vehicle seat while the booster is unoccupied and help facilitate independent buckling, you will secure your child in the booster seat with the vehicle lap/shoulder belt. The seat has an integrated cup holder and hideaway storage compartment to keep child's drinks and favorite things within arm's reach. This seat is Graco Protect Plus Engineered to help protect your child in frontal, rear & rollover crashes. To continue to meet industry standards, we have increased the weight minimum from 30 to 40 lb Since the Latch system only secures the booster seat to the vehicle in this application and is not used for installation, it may be used regardless of the weight of the child (up to the maximum weight recommendation of the seat). Care and Maintenance: Machine-washable seat cushion. Metal and plastic parts may be cleaned with mild soap and cool water.Graco\u00ae TurboBooster\u00ae LX Backless Booster with Affix Latch | Backless Booster Seat for Big Kids Transitioning to Vehicle Seat Belt (Rio)The TurboBooster LX Backless Booster with LATCH helps safely transport your big kid from 40 to 100 lb and 43-57\".
