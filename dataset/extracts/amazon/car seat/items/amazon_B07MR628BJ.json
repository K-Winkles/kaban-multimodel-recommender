                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Kick Mat Auto Seat Back Protectors + Organizer Pockets By Lebogner - Luxury Seat Covers For The Back Of Your Front Seats 2 Pack, X-Large Car Back Seat Protectors, Backseat Child Kick Guard Seat Saver These kick mat/organizers are great for everyday use or long trips. You can stop those little feet from ruining the back of your car seats and keep them intertained at the same time with the things that you store in them. Or, maybe you don't have little ones and just need to have a place to store things for adults that will be riding in the car with you, like Kleenex tissues, pencil/pen and paper, cell phone, etc.They are made of a high quality material that is water proof and very durable. Although they are machine washable unless there is a lot of mud on them I just wipe my off because they are water proof. One quick wipe with a damp rag and they look like new again. This saves me a lot of money and time that I was spending at the car wash getting my car detailed and cleaned.The mats themselves measure 19\" wide X 27\" long, but they have adjustable straps at the top and bottom to ensure a fit on most cars. The adjustable straps once pulled tightly will keep the kick mats from moving around and adjusted exactly where you want them. They have 3 pockets that keep everything within your child's reach. These kick mats are light weight and easy to install. it only takes a few seconds. Say good-bye to all of those run away crayons and pencils.",

You can keep packing them long after you think they'd be full.With a youngster on board you can put one on the back of the seat for their books/games and one facing forwards next to them with drinks and wipes etc. When Im on a journey on my own I clip one to the front of the passenger seat facing forwards to keep all the stuff in that rattles around that you may need when theres no spare pair of hands to pass you stuff - Ive yet to ask the wife sit in the back so I can keep it there :)Since having these I no longer have to take up the space in the boot and the dog seems to be a lot more relaxedIf you like my feedback please click it as useful as it is encouraging to write more of them",
