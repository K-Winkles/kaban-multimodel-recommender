It is perfect for parents to see their little ones in the back seat without having to turn around. The mirror is also adjustable 360 degrees, making it easy to find the perfect angle for optimal visibility.Another standout feature of this product is the safety aspect. It is crash tested and shatterproof, which is essential for parents who are concerned about the safety of their children while driving. The soft night light is also a great addition, as it provides just the right amount of illumination to check on your little one without disturbing their sleep.Overall, I highly recommend the Baby Car Mirror with Night Light. It is a well-designed, high-quality product that provides an excellent combination of safety and convenience. It is also very easy to install, which is a bonus for busy parents on the go.",

                "reviewText": "Not only was this easy to install, but so perfect for night driving to check on my youngest. I have 3 kids and have had this type of mirror before but always avoided night trips to the store because I couldn't see them. This mirror and light makes night trips easier, safer and better peace of mind! I could see my sons head when he was in his infant seat but the headrest on his convertible carseat was much wider so I couldn't see him anymore when he got upgraded but this was not only bigger than the one I usually get but only 50c more and had the remote control light! I've used it for almost a month now and it works amazingly and it bright enough for me to see very clearly but not too bright as to wake him up if he's sleeping. And I'm also a very firm believer in not adding things to your carseat or car that could pose a danger in an accident so I was very happy to see that when tightened to the headrest and properly installed, this mirror doesn't move at all! Definitely recommend!!",

                "reviewText": "I think this is a decent baby mirror. I chose this one because it lights up so I can see my baby at night. The remote control is very useful. You can have a low light that lasts a few minutes or click another button for a bright beam of light for a few seconds to see the baby clearly at night. It also plays lullaby misic that is soothing. I find i have to replace the batteries often to maintain full light beam otherwise it gets very dim. Also, it is very finicky to set up on the headrest. I don't have great headrests in my car but my husband does and its was annoying to set up there too. And it shifts if you hit bumps or dont have it set tight enough. I do have two so each car has a view of our rear facing baby.",

We already had a baby car mirror (without lights) but had difficulty during evening hours when the baby used to get scared and go crazy by crying as it is dark. We literally stopped going out in the evenings. After installing this baby mirror the crying has completely stopped.Best part is my wife doesn't even have to sit in the backseatThings I liked- Remote works perfectly to switch on/off the lights.- Lights are bright but anti glare so works perfectly for baby as well as me(driver)- Quality product and finish is pretty good- Installing took less than 5 mts and super simple.- Mirror is clear and shatterproof so no worries about baby getting hurt in case of accident",
