        "description": "Get the car seat that's built to grow! From your first ride together coming home from the hospital to soccer day car pools, the 3-in-1 grow and Go car seat will give your child a safer and more comfortable ride. Featuring extended use at each stage, This convertible car seat is designed to last through all your firsts with your child. For newborns to growing toddlers, The Grow and Go can be used in the rear-facing position from 5-40 pounds. It includes 2 comfortable grow-with-baby pillows to give your new travel companion a snug fit, and they easily remove as your baby outgrows them. In forward-facing mode, The Grow and Go keeps your child protected in a harness up to 65 pounds. In both rear-facing and forward-facing mode, harness holders keep the harness in an open position. This makes it easier for you to get your child in and out of the car seat. No more fishing for the harness and clips from behind your child - they're right there when you need them. The quick fit Harness offers additional convenience in both of these stages by letting you adjust the height of both the headrest and harness in 1 easy step, making it simple to give your growing child The best fit. When your child is ready to use the vehicle seat belts, remove the harness to use the Grow and Go 3-in-1 car Seat in belt-positioning booster mode: up to 100 pounds. The headrest still adjusts easily, letting you get the best fit for your child. As your tiny baby grows into a big kid, messes are bound to happen, but the Grow and Go car seat pad makes cleanup easy. Machine washable and dryer safe, It is also designed to come off the seat easily, with no need to remove the harness. The Grow and Go is designed to provide more comfort to parents too. It takes up less room when placed rear-facing, giving up to 7 inches more leg room for parents in the front seat.",

                "reviewText": "I decided to write this review after reading through the reviews earlier today. I have had this car seat for almost a year. I started using it when my baby was getting too heavy to carry in the infant seat and I wanted something that would stay in my car all the time. First of all, I love the Minnie Mouse design. I\u2019m not sure why others had a hard time installing it because it was the exact same way that I\u2019ve installed every car seat I\u2019ve ever owned. (I have 3 kids and we\u2019ve gone through at least 6 or 7 car seats here). The anchor clips are exactly the same as any other brand I\u2019ve seen (I\u2019ve used graco, britax, chicco, and evenflo, as well as other safety first styles). You can also use the seatbelt install if your car has locking seatbelts. Just make sure you don\u2019t use both methods at the same time as it can put too much stress on the seat and cause it to not function properly over time. The straps are the standard 5 point harness style that is used in America and Canada. I saw some reviews saying the straps are wrong and \u201cunsafe\u201d but I think they were wanting the outdated 3 point harness style with no chest clip like they still use in Australia, the UK, and I believe Asia. Overall, this seat is very easy to install. The padding and material are very soft and comfortable for my baby. I like the ability to raise the back up as she gets taller. I plan to rear face for an extended period of time since my daughter is smaller than average and I\u2019m glad I found this seat that I can use throughout that whole time and also when she\u2019s older and I can forward face her.",

The reason I\u2019m giving it 4 out of 5 stars because when purchasing the car seat my daughter wanted for the baby we did not realize until the day before she gave birth that the car seat didn\u2019t come with a handle to carry baby. Making it inconvenient for transport in my opinion. Thank goodness we had an extra donated car seat on hand until baby gets older.",
