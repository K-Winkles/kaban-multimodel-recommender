She loves the Minnie design. My only thing is the cup holders came off easy so she was able to lose them quick (I just put them back natural consequence she has to hold her drink). It\u2019s easy and quick to remove the insert and washes well. No loose threads. It\u2019s also easy to put back together!",

I was able to figure it out fairly easily, but maybe I\u2019m just a little rusty on car seat installation \ud83d\ude05. It was simple to figure out how to install it as a front facing & rear facing & it works great as both. I\u2019m not sure if it was how I installed them, but the cup holders feel a bit flimsy, like they won\u2019t stay clipped into their spot. Might need to mess with it a bit more, but so far he says it works & his daughter is comfy and doesn\u2019t fuss while she\u2019s in it.",

                "reviewText": "This car seat is much slimmer than your average car seat (see photo, compared to a Safety 1st car seat) & you have to pop the cup holders in yourself - they\u2019re not built in, but they can be inserted in on your own, which I can see being an issue in the future as my son loves to throw things. It\u2019s an absolutely adorable seat though and it fits perfectly inside of my 2008 Ford Escape (in the center row, too!) but I just hope there\u2019s enough padding to it considering how slim it is. I do really like the height, though, because my son is very tall & I think he\u2019ll appreciate that very much as he grows. So overall, it could be better but I also don\u2019t really have any major complaints either.",
