With a carrying strap and a quick-release system, Olli gives kids the freedom to carry their own ride wherever they go \u2013 from your car to a taxi or even a plane.",

Still looked brand new since we don't allow food in our car. This was a good choice for her now that she is six. I still trust the Clek brand and like the fact that it is made in North America. What I was disappointed in was that it was called 'Mammoth' the same as the Fllo but this one has no wool in the fabric. I might have bought another color if I'd realized that. We have an Olli now in two other family cars. They are easy to carry in the airport and put in the overhead compartment on a plane. We just clipped it into the rental car and were all set without having to use a seat provided by the rental company.",
