                "reviewText": "-Pros: Narrow exterior, not too bulky. Solid as a rock. Anti rebound bar for safety. High weight limit for extended rear facing. EASIEST straps to tighten and loosen, compared to my experiences with Britax, Evenflo, and Nuna: glides smoothly, doesn\u2019t get asymmetric.-Neutral: Heavy, which is no big deal, just fyi, while NARROW enough for airplane travel, it\u2019s too heavy to be practical for airplane travel. Lacks the many many subtle angle adjustments of other brands, you just kinda jam it where it looks right, but I\u2019ve found that is not a con, kinda nice to have it a bit simpler. Pretty firm, not as squishy as some brands\u2014my kids like that less claustrophobic feel but yours might prefer marshmallow cocoon seat.Cons: Cupholder accessory (separate) doesn\u2019t attach properly for some users in rear facing position (minor in my view). You have to uninstall, rethread the harness straps, and reinstall as kid grows.If deciding between Fllo and Foonf: sure, the Foonf LATCH of mega power is cool, but as far as I understand it is only for forward facing up to a modest weight limit\u2014so you will never use that LATCH feature if you do extended rear-facing, which is by far the simplest, most powerful choice you can make to ensure toddler / little kid safety. Maybe I\u2019m missing something. But that\u2019s why I chose Fllo.",
