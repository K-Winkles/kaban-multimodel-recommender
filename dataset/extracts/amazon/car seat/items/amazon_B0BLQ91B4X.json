                "reviewText": "I did so much research before deciding and went through lots of video reviews. I was looking for ease of installation but also super durable and comfortable. My son absolutely loved the seats comfort and cushion. I couldn\u2019t believe it he feel asleep both times he was in it the first time.This is going to be crucial as we often take long road trips to visit the in laws. I needed the rotation bc it\u2019s hard for me to get him in the seat and avoid bumping his head when he wiggles. He is 14m now and I expect him to grow pretty fast so let\u2019s see how this goes. Happy with the purchase. I could have spent less or more but for me I need the product to work. I will pay more if it\u2019s what I need to do. I thought this was a good value and the slim design is best for more compact cars. Happy with this purchase",

                "reviewText": "Love the quality, comfort, security and the swivel. My son doesn't slouch his head anymore or go forward when we accelerate like his infant seat. (Yes the buckle was at his armpits)I don't really like that it doesn't have a carry handle. Tonight I realized that if my son falls asleep we have to physically remove him when we get home which wakes him up instead of being able to easily carry him in the seat still sound asleep. We get in the door and usually have a few minutes to set things down before he wakes up. Also there's no pull over shade to keep the sun out of his eyes in the car. Pretty dissapointed about that. And I can't easily put him in the stroller or grocery cart like my other infant car seat. My son just turned 5 months so we're in this in-between stage where he's almost too big for his infant seat, and can't sit on his own in a shopping cart. So there's that, but I hate carrying him in his infant car seat cause its so darn heavy with him in it and it doesn't swivel so I hurt my back and arms almost everytime taking him places and it makes me not want to leave the house. I know I just contradicted myself there from an earlier statement I made but I'm so 50/50 on which seat to use right now BTW I'm only 4'11\" and live on the 3rd floor of an apartment with lots of stairs so yeah tough predicament.",
