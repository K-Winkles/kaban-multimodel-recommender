With a BubbleBum- Optimum Seatbelt Fit The BubbleBum is designed to raise the child up, allowing optimum fit of the vehicle seatbelt. This 'boost' combined with our rigid side clips, keeps the lap belt securely positioned across the bony portion of the pelvis.

It's legal to use in 27 countries, it's crash tested to EU standards too. The only difference between the USA & EU is the label. The physical seat is the same. Is it safe? Yes, the BubbleBum has been crash tested for both USA and EU use and meets and exceeds both requirements. The seat is tested for frontal, rear and rollover crash scenarios. Does the BubbleBum expire? The BubbleBum should be replaced 4 years AFTER FIRST USE. This is because the materials may deteriorate over time if it is used continually in extreme temperatures. Will it fit? The sitting area of the BubbleBum is 11 X 4.5 X 11 Inches. The dimensions of the BubbleBum have been determined by using the average hip width of 11year old American children. This should allow you to save space in the rear seat. What if I have a problem? We would love to hear from you! We are a family-run business that really cares about our customers. Please let us know so we can help you if you encounter any issue, no matter how big or small. We offer a lifetime warrantee on all our boosters.",

And our five year old needed a car seat and we don\u2019t want to bring our current hard bulky one on the airplane so we bought this. You basically blow in air to inflate it and when done your can let the air out to store it. It has a seat belt adjuster thing so the seat belt won\u2019t bother your child\u2019s neck and sits right on top of the shoulder. Great overall.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Convenient, lightweight, easily packed and fast inflation - currently the best designed booster seat for traveling",
                "reviewText": "This is an outstanding idea - and it's well executed. This booster seat is incredibly lightweight, it's easy and fast to inflate/deflate, it's very compact when deflated (folded or rolled up), it's made of quality and durable materials - and it's easy on the car's interior (won't damage your seats). From the functional standpoint, this seat is small and sits a little lower than more conventional booster seats. The belt guides are sturdy and made of quality materials that shouldn't damage seat belts over time. Overall - this is a great product.Nevertheless, I need to temper the positive aspects of this booster seat with the fact this type of booster seat (lap belt guide only) should only be used with a secondary type of restraint - like a safety vest that incorporates belt guides for both the lap and shoulder belts. A great example is the Ride Safer vest system by Safe Traffic Systems. The Ride Safer vest not only properly guides both the lap and shoulder belts, it's reinforced, padded and is designed to better distribute crash forces over a much larger area than what a standard seat belt is capable of. I think this is a two-way relationship as well, though. The best application of the Ride Safer vest is in conjunction with a quality (certified) booster seat like this one.I think it is important to frame an opinion, and help the reader understand the perspective from which a review is written - especially when that opinion is regarding safety equipment. I have a two-decade background in military safety, relating to both off-duty (ground) safety and aviation safety - to include mishap investigation. This experience includes investigating motor vehicle mishaps (there is no such thing as an \"accident\").Motor vehicle fatalities account for over 30,000 deaths per year in the U.S. (33,561 in 2012*). Children account for approximately 1,200 of these deaths. While this number seems tiny compared to the total number of fatalities - the number of child fatalities per mile is comparable to adults. The exposure rate of adults is simply higher (the number of hours the average adult is on the road when compared to children - and children account for only 1/6th of the population). The number of children injured in motor vehicle mishaps in the U.S. is however staggering - approximately 170,000 children per year.One of the biggest contributing causal factors for child injuries and deaths is the child being out of position relative to the restraining device - preventing the safety equipment from restraining and mitigating the forces of the crash properly. The only purpose a booster seat serves is to better position (elevate) a child relative to the shoulder strap, to prevent the shoulder strap from riding up a child's neck and face by ensuring the proper angle of the shoulder belt (relative to the child's shoulder and neck). This angle is critical for any occupant. If the occupant sits too high relative to the shoulder belt (typically an adult or tall child), a collision can cause geometry-related secondary spinal injuries (mid and lower back) caused by the shoulder belt transmitting too much crash energy to the mid and lower back. If the occupant sits too low (typically with a small child), a collision can result in the child sliding under the shoulder belt - which can severely injure the child's neck (and face).The biggest problem with using a booster seat that only guides the lap belt is in the assumption that booster seat will keep a child in the correct position relative to the shoulder strap for the entirety of your travels (and therefore safe). If you have a kid - then you know any assumption that your child is going to stay in one position is simply not even remotely similar to reality. Kids move and wiggle around a lot, and a booster seat equipped with simple lap belt guides is not going to do anything to maintain the proper shoulder belt alignment with your precious, perpetual motion, micro human. Unfortunately, the results can be tragic. This is why I strongly believe in a certified safety vest like the Ride Safer safety vest in conjunction with a properly designed booster seat.A certified and tested safety vest physically attaches (and therefore attaches your child) to the seat belt, and the vest's belt guides help ensure the child's position remains correct at all times - and the booster seat ensures there is not any excess force transmitted to the child's neck and head in a collision by providing the proper geometry of the shoulder belt relative to the vest's upper belt guide.This particular inflatable booster seat is the perfect travel companion - especially with a certified safety vest. While automotive safety vests and booster seats are not certified and should not be used for air travel, they can be easily packed and used in taxi cabs, and in the event the front seat is the only available place for the child. While not optimal (a back seat is considered safer than the front seat for children), a child can safely travel with the combination of this booster seat and the safety vest in the front seat of a car, truck or two-seat sports car - and this is also legal in most states (check your local laws for specific requirements and restrictions). If this is done, you should of course ensure the child is sitting as far back from an airbag (if so equipped) as possible, or if your car is equipped with an airbag deactivation device (many cars do this automatically based on the weight in the passenger seat), then it is recommended it be deactivated for individuals weighing less than about 65-70lbs. I would not recommend using this booster seat (any booster seat) by itself in the front seat. I would only recommend the use of a booster seat in the front seat when used in conjunction with a certified safety vest that meets Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS 213).This review and my mentioning of the Ride Safer safety vest in this review were both unsolicited by their respective manufacturers. I did not receive any compensation (in any form) for my review.*NHTSA DOT HS 812 011",

                "reviewText": "We are on our second Bubble Bum! This is the most comfortable portable car seat, and we have taken it on many vacations.It's not as compact as the Mifold, it takes up about half of a child's sized backpack. (We also have a Mifold.) When deflated and put in the bag it's still quite large. However, it is very lightweight.It's not a large seat, so if your child is on the larger side, this seat may not be as comfortable.Because it is inflatable, it is comfortable for longer car rides. The Mifold is not comfortable at all, being a GenXer myself I would say the Mifold is similar to sitting on a phone book. The Bubble Bum works great for vacations where there may be a long car ride. My child definitely prefers the Bubble Bum to the Mifold.It's super fast and easy to inflate and then adjust the seatbelt through the guides. My daughter has used the Bubble Bum for 1+ hour car rides and has been comfortable the whole time. She complained about the Mifold within about 10 minutes.I'd say the only downside is the size. It's less heavy and bulky than a plastic booster seat but it still can take up quite a bit of room in a bag. We use the Mifold if we need room in our bag and the car rides will be super short. I send her with the Mifold if she's going to a friend's house and they might have a short ride of 15 minutes or less somewhere. We take the Bubble Bum on vacations and deal with the size because it is way more comfortable.We are on our second Bubble Bum because they do expire. We are excited about the new patterns on the covers! This one should take us through until she no longer needs a booster seat!",
