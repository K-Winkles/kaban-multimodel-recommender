Should've measured my seat though and paid a little more attention to dimensions because they are just slightly skinnier than I'd like, but they still work absolutely perfectly for what I was wanting. Install was fairly simple and easy. They seem like they're very nice quality and I'm very pleased.*Edit: still leaving original comments but wanted to add a couple of things after using for a bit. The party about me not measuring or paying attention to how wide they are has bit me I little more in the butt than what I expected as it was too keep a toddlers feet off the back of my seat and now sed toddler puts their feet beside the edges of the organizer so still on my seats. That's my fault not sellers just hoping that this helps others to measure before they buy. However, there is a manufacturer issue with the wipe holder. I'm not sure exactly what type of wipes are expected to go in the holder but I have parent choice and you have to squeeze really hard to get the package to fit in and the opening for the package does not work with the opening for holder like at all.",

                "reviewText": "The tablet pocket is a nice size for a variety of tablets the zipper for the headphone or charger port is convenient seeing that all tablets are made equally. I wasn't a fan of how much space that wasn't being used when not in use. The headphone holder is detachable which made it easy to possibly lose. So I kept it in the \"pocket for valuable\" which is a small zipper pocket attached to the organizer located in the same area of the Velcro for the wipes holder. I found this location to be difficult to put items in for bulking up the Velcro making it harder to keep the wipes holder on the designated area. I was impressed by the wipes holder ability to contain a full pack of wipes (about 70 ct) and keep them moist, even though I had a hard time keeping it attached to the organizer. In the minivan it would get knocked off by passengers trying to get in the rear seat. Although the cupholders are generous the strechy mesh pockets are not. I didn't get to use for a stroller. But the straps for this feature doesn't tend to stick out the side which is pro or con depending on your needs.",

                "reviewText": "works great for my kids tablets when we are traveling so they can watch a movie and not drop the tablet, or when they don't need the tablet it stores it safely so it doesn't end up on the floor. Wipe container allows them to clean up spills on their own or I have tissues in one side so they can use that when needed. The extra pocket works great for storing coloring books, and other kids toys and the bottle holder works good for their travel water bottles or other snacks. easy to take out and put on a stroller or kids wagon to use in a different setting as well.",

I now can have everything from drinks to activities all ready to go without having to scramble around carrying everything in and out of the car or worrying about things getting lost or damaged on the floor. It was a challenge to install it not because of the product, but the way my car is set up...however, the designer thought of all these issues ahead of time and made everything adjustable. Thank you for an amazing product!!",
