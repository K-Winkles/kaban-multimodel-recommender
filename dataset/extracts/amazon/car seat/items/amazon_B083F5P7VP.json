                "reviewText": "I flew two trips with this and another seat. It is heavy for flights, but I managed, also fairly quick and easy to install in a plane seat. If flying with it again I would devise a way to lock it folded up and to carry it as a backpack. Usually it is installed in a full size truck and I like how it looks and is easy to get in and out of for my 4 almost 5 yr old. Full metal frame and latch design is not cheap so has me convinced it's a good safe choice. The last seat I'll need to buy I think.",

Most car seats turn backseats into a claustrophobic\u2019s nightmare, but not these! They also travel well (although their sturdy frame makes them a bit heavier). We throw one under our stroller and one strapped to a roller suitcase handle to transport them the short distance to airport baggage checks. Highly recommend and our toddler loves them!",

                "reviewText": "There were 2 features I purchased this for. The narrow construction that allows for 3 carseats side by side. It took 2 of these and another narrow seat to fit forward facing in a Saturn ion. Second is the all in one. Won't need to buy another seat or booster.If used rear facing, these take up more room than other seats. They are tall, plus the angle make it difficult to fit in a small car with a tall person in the front seat. Would not work for an infant in my Ion.I also like that is very sturdy. There's lots of metal in the construction. Feels safer. The trade-off is that it's heavy. But that's not a concern unless moving it from car to car all the time.Have only used as a forward facing carseat so far. But I like all the options that it can be used for. There are less expensive seats, but having to buy a rear facing, then forward, then a booster ads up. May save money in the long run if starting with just this one all-in-one.On the other hand, the dedicated infant car seats that can detach are super handy for going into stores without unbuckling your baby. Something to consider.Overall, highly recommend this seat.",

                "reviewText": "I randomly decided to downsize from a three-row vehicle to a two-row vehicle, so I needed to find car seats that would fit 3 across comfortably. These car seats definitely work for that.The thing I didn\u2019t like about them is the company\u2019s attempt to save money by not providing any instructions in the box (3 new boxes and absolutely no instructions). There are picture instructions on the side of the car seats, but like most things, these car seats are a little different than other car seats, so more detailed instructions would\u2019ve been appreciated-particularly for rear-facing installation. If they want to save money, maybe they should provide a QR code with links to instructions and videos. They didn\u2019t so I was left trying to find instructions for my exact model.The belts that give you lax for anchoring are also really annoying. Broke a few nails in the process.",

But once I also attached the tether by following the instructions and looping it around the seat in fronts track, it appears to be tight enough now. I am going to double check it and if needed add the seatbelt as well. This is only the third car seat I\u2019ve ever installed before so I\u2019m not a complete expert.My daughter hasn\u2019t used it yet but I will update my review once we use it for a while. I bought this particular car seat because it looks simple and it doesn\u2019t block her view much and it feels very comfortable just from me pressing on it. And it is supposedly good for extended rear-facing. It is also a nice looking car seat from a reputable brand.",
