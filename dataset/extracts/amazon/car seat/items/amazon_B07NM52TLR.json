First up performance fabric is a joke and this car seat got dirty so much quicker and doesn\u2019t wipe clean nicely.So, to clean it, wow, just wow! You have to completely dismantle the product, like seriously! This is made for babies and up. You are going to want to clean it and regularly. Not this car seat. Avoid like the plague!!! I was my car seats often (not this one, because it is so hard, we are talking screw driver and dismantling a million tabs and pulling plastic apart!) no way! No way! Would I ever buy this car seat again. It is stiff, hard to adjust and this cleaning is a joke! I have had britax car seats, and uppa baby maxi cosi, and chicco. This is my least favorite! I am going throw away almost 1,000.00 worth of car seat because I can\u2019t stand this! It is not for the parent that like to clean car seats regularly. And this fabric is a joke. I can\u2019t believe how dirty these are and it hasn\u2019t even been a year and I have been wiping them regularly but got them out and they are disgusting!",

Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t buy the \u201cmat thingy\u201d Clek also makes right away,. In my car (2016 Tesla Model S), the only viable position for this seat is the center, and that means there are only seatbelts, no LATCH hooks. In order to get a secure fit, I keep on tightening the seat belt until it moved by less than 1\u201d - as the directions indicated. Three days later, I took the seat back out of the car, and my leather seats had some pretty severe indentations from the underside of the seat.I really don\u2019t understand why the base of the car seat would do that to a car. This is why I\u2019m subtracting a star. Either don\u2019t damage my car, or include the mat thingy in the price.",

I had to pull over as fast as I could. I can\u2019t let my baby sleep in this seat unless I can hold their head. It is fully reclined and meets every requirement the Clek told me to do. And my child has full head control, they are even able to sit on their own. Please for the love of your baby don\u2019t buy this. I am now stuck with 2 of them and Clek won\u2019t take them back one massive bill and a pissed off spouse that I spent so much on awful seats. O and now I need to by new seats that my baby can actually ride in. I hope to save even one baby and parent from the headache that is this seat!!!! If you still want this seat you must not love your child.",
