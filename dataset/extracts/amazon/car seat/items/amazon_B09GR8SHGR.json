Listen, growing up happens, and your little needs to be safe and secure every step of the way. Enter the Century Drive On 3-in-1 Car Seat, nicknamed \"The Fantastic Fit\" for its clever, streamlined design. Part of our Happy Planet Collection, this car seat is made with fabrics made from recycled materials. That's part of our Do More promise to Recycle, Reimagine, and Give Back. With 3 modes of use for kids 5-100 lb, it grows as your mini does. Also awesome: Its slim design saves precious back seat space, so there's plenty of room for everyone else. And how about this? A no-rethread harness system means no strap struggle when it's time to adjust. The one-hand adjustment leaves one hand to pull snug and one hand for baby\u2014makes sense, right? Century KeepSafe means this seat is designed and tested to help provide safe and secure protection so you can focus on the road ahead.",

So when my grandson graduated from a rear facing baby seat, I knew we all wanted him to ride in a comfortable, safe, good quality front facing seat.I ordered two of these car seats to start with. They are appropriate for both front facing and rear facing set up. They arrived set up for rear facing use. I checked everything out carefully to make sure this was good enough for my most precious cargo.After NOT reading the instructions properly, and through the ensuing trial and error, I figured out that this seat is easy to secure properly and firmly in my car. The lower anchor straps do need to be relocated for front facing use, and this is really easy! Once done, installation is quick. (Found that out the hard way of course)I love how padded and comfortable this seat is, the ease in which the shoulder straps can be adjusted by raising and lowering the headrest and will grow with my grandson, the seat recline settings, the side impact protection, the cup holders are a nice bonus too.Once I figured out that this was a great car seat, I bought my daughter and son in law one for each of their cars, then ordered a third one for my car since I'm incredibly blessed to live in the same town as my kids and grandson, and I get to grandparent him a lot while his Mum and Dad are both working.Incidentally, Century was bought out in 2000 by Graco. Now Graco makes a lower price point car seat under the brand name of Century. Century is not an unknown brand with no history, as some people believe....it's just not as ridiculously expensive as Graco branded car seats.",

                "reviewText": "This car seat is solid (great styling, well constructed, easy to install, cup holders a bonus) and it\u2019s priced so well we were able to buy 3 for each of the relevant vehicles. I hate wasting money (in this case hundreds of dollars) for a specific brand name (you\u2019re paying for marketing and falling into the consumer trap) when the generic item is almost exactly the same item. No one needs to pay $500 for a car seat, when the same safety features are available at 1/4 to 1/5 the cost. Plus the bonus is that the baby absolutely loves it (so much better than trying to lay an active 20-lb 8-mo old on their back like a newborn). Highly recommended! 5-stars \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f BUY IT!",

It functions very similarly to our Knox, is lightweight and my rear-facing toddler is comfortable in it. The cupholders are the only annoying part: they are required for use and are difficult to attach. I\u2019d still recommend it, even as a full-time car seat!",
