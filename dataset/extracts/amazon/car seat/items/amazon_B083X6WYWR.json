The seat is easy to use, stylish, comfortable and my LO a actually likes his car seat! To those that said it\u2019s not comfortable and it\u2019s a hard seat, not the case at all. Respectfully , those individuals missed a step. Once you remove the infant insert, you will need to fold down the rest of the seat that\u2019s tucked under the back area (area where your child\u2019s back meets the seat). We also love that our LO stays rear facing for longer with this seat. Which is key for his safety. He\u2019s three now and still rear facing and not close to either limit for seated height or weight rear facing limits. We love the Britax brand and love how they EXCEED US and EU car seat standards!",
