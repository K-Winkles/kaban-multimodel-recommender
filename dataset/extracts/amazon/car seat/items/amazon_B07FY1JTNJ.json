        "description": "Made In Italy. Protect your child all around with the 2-in-1 Viaggio Shuttle Plus! Its flexibility to adjust all around allows it to fit your child perfectly. Transforming from an all-around adjustable booster to a backless booster, the Viaggio Shuttle Plus will grow with your child! The Viaggio Shuttle Plus has the unique capability to fully accommodate a child's growth with it's 3D Total Adjust Technology. This means the booster can be adjusted in three different locations: 1) the headrest can adjust to five different positions vertically, 2) the upper backrest adjusts three positions vertically, 3) the side wings can expand out three positons. These adjustments can be made independently from each other, allowing for a truly original experience in comfort. Securing the Viaggio Shuttle Plus to the car is made easier with the integrated rigid LATCH, equipped with a blind lock attaching system which prevents the seat from being accidentally released by another passenger. The rigid LATCH can tuck back into the base, allowing for an easy installation if LATCH is not available. An aluminum-reinforced backrest ensures safety and protection against whiplash in the case of a front-end accident and additional protection in the event of a rear-end collision. EPS throughout the side wings and headrest also serves to absorb energy during a crash. The Viaggio Shuttle Plus has the ability to transform into a backless booster to grow with your child. No need to purchase a highback booster and a backless booster when the Shuttle Plus is 2-in-1. With the simple push of a button, the backrest can be removed.",

                "reviewText": "I've purchased and returned a dozen boosters and most are so beyond frustrating that I take months off in between shopping. This one finally, finally is smart. It's totally adjustable and will fit any kid. Our daughter is 6. The back of it is aluminum, not cheap plastic, so it is actually sturdy. The rigid latch will secure it to your car, rock solid, even preventing side to side wiggle. And it's narrow, so you can actually get to the seat belt latch. The upper part where the belt goes through is also the best design so far, so the belt can't come out and believe it or not, the \"recline\" feature actually works. And works well. This is quality Italian engineering and you get what you pay for. Ive confirmed to fit across several BMWs (X3, 5 serie, M3) which are notoriously challenging with latch and rear space, so this should work in any car. And yes, it's price is outrageous. Double or triple what the others cost. It's also better than the cheaper one from the same company because of the aluminum back and adjustability. So if you're like me and ready to give up shopping for these things, know that this one is finally smart.",

Now we have two of these seats, one for each car. Good quality and comfortable for my daughter who is taller than the typical 5 year old.",
