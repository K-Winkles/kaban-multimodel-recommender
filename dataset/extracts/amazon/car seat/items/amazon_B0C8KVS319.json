        "description": "Get the car seat thats built to grow! From your first ride together coming home from the hospital to soccer day car pools, the Crosstown DLX Car Seat will give your child a safe and more comfortable ride. Featuring the new single hand adjustable headrest, you can adjust the headrest and harness as your little one gets bigger with just one hand and in one quick motion, without re-threading the harness or re-installing the car seat. Harness holders keep the harness straps out of the way, making it easier to get your child in and out of the car seat. As your tiny baby grows into a big kid, messes are bound to happen, but weve made cleaning easy. The seat pad snaps off easily without removing the harness and is machine washable and dryer safe. Dual cup holders transport favorite drinks and snacks and are easily removable and dishwasher safe. When your child is ready to use the vehicle seat belts, remove the harness for belt-positioning booster mode, suitable from 40-100 lbs. Buckling up with the vehicle belt is easy with the visible belt path guiding the way. Built for child comfort, the Crosstown DLX includes two removable grow-with-baby pillows to give your new travel companion a snug fit. Dual armrests provide added comfort for older kids on long car rides. The Crosstown DLX provides more comfort for parents too, taking up less space when placed rear-facing, giving up to 7 inches more legroom for parents in the front seat.",

It\u2019s a comfortable feeing seat for sure, looks great, baby doesn\u2019t cry when riding in it which was an issue in her baby bucket seat\u2026it\u2019s easy to adjust the height of harness and the tightness of straps! We don\u2019t use the shoulder pads right now as I had to take them off to get a proper fit for my little one when we first started to use the seat and she\u2019s still on the smaller side for them\u2026rear facing I love the seat recline adjustments it has-it\u2019s got more than 1 spot that can be used which I love so much more than seats that don\u2019t have that. The seat was so easy to instal it took me less than 5 mins to have a perfect instal and I didn\u2019t have to fight it to get it in tight at all which shocked me. Sometimes to adjust the harness tightness I do fight with it-but not usually\u2026The seat fabric is really cute and has held up amazing so far. It isn\u2019t stained at all even after we had a blow out poop diaper and throw up happen in the car\u2026which impressed me not gunna lie\u2026I did not enjoy removing the cover of seat to wash it however and it was painful to put back together but it was doable\u2026The crotch strap has 3 diff spots to adjust it to baby which I like\u2026the instructions for the smallest size is confusing I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t need to set it up that small\u2026baby is now 19 pounds and 22 inches long and fits in the seat super comfortably she\u2019s a little chunky girl and the width leaves her with more space than she needs which is why we upgraded her before she was sitting unsupported to a convertible seat rear facing as her bucket seat was way to narrow for her!",

Its pretty simple to install too, and it is narrow enough so two people fit comfortably in the back with him. Definitely a good purchase!",

                "reviewText": "After days and days of research and comparing reviews I came across this carseat and I'm so glad I did! Previous to this carseat I bought an infant seat and my baby was outgrowing it come to find out we could've been using this all along was an eye opener, not to mention it converts into a front facing and booster... no need to buy another seat! This seat will save you money and time. The first time I put my child in this seat she was HAPPY, it must be so comfortable for her. Just by feeling it I can tell it's very padded and not to closed in that they feel crammed in there. Yet they did not skimp out on the safety features! This thing is sturdy once straped it, no wobbling or scooting, stays right in place, the seat belt goes inbetween the plastic and fabric so that there's so way the belt can slip off which my last seat did and always made me nervous. This thing has hit EVERY buying feature I looked for! #1 safety #2 comfort #3 affordable ( and #4 my child LOVES it! ) It also came with a recall form which provides me comfort in knowing they will get in touch with me if it becomes unsafe. Thank you for providing us with an affordable and safe product!",
