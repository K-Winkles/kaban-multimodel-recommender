        "description": "The Safety 1st Grand 2-in-1 Booster Car Seat may be the last one you will ever need. It features extended use in both of its two modes. It starts by keeping kids securely in a 5-point safety harness in forward-facing mode all the way up to 65 pounds. In its second mode, as a belt-positioning booster, it has them covered up to 120 pounds.The Grand 2-in-1 Booster Car Seat has also been tested for multiple types of crashes and exceeds federal safety standards. Its lightweight and easy to move from car to car, which is excellent for families who are always on the go. This booster car seat also easily fits 3 across in the back seat of most vehicles making it a smart choice for growing families with multiple kids in car seats. And the seat comes with an adjustable head pillow to provide customizable support as they grow.The deluxe fabric gives kids a comfy ride with its textured nylon, smooth knit jersey and lamination that gives it a soft, plush feel. Its designed to provide excellent ergonomic support in the headrest, shoulders, back and seat of the padthe key pressure points for where your childs weight rests.With kids in the car, messes happen. But thanks to the easy-to-clean booster car seat pad, theres no need to stress. The pad removes from the seat and is both machine washable and dryer safe, so a thorough wash is just a machine cycle away. And with two removable, dishwasher-safe cup holders, kids will have their very own place for drinks or small toys.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. As a family of 5, I needed a budget-friendly, narrow car seat option for our three year old twin toddlers. This seat has worked great! Very lightweight and easy to install. I can install the seat in less than 30 seconds so it is also a great option for a nanny or babysitter who will install and remove frequently. Narrow enough to fit all 3 kids in the backseat of our VW Jetta. The padding is not very thick so it may not be comfortable for an extended roadtrip but it works great for daily car ride to the store and school.",

                "reviewText": "We already had a carseat but wanted a backup for our second vehicle. We got this one for a great deal (under $60) and it's been great so far! I love that the latch straps can go up to 50lbs because on our other seats they can only be used up to 45lbs which was a big deal because the seatbelts in our second vehicle do not lock. This seat is a lot less bulky than our other seat and way lighter in weight so it would be ideal for traveling. There are a few things that are less quality than more expensive seats but that obviously happens when you're not paying $200+, for example you have to manually re-thread the straps when they need to be adjusted, there is a lot less padding than our high end seats, and the edges can be pretty sharp. The install strap can be hard to get tight but once it's tightened the seat won't move. It's nice that once our kiddo outgrows the harness it can be converted into a high back booster seat as well. Overall happy with this seat.",

                "reviewText": "I went to go visit my daughter in a different state, and I had to fly with three of my children. I ordered three car seats and had them shipped to her home not knowing if whether or not, they will fit in the backseat of her car. When looking online, I only seen two car seats either side-by-side or a space in between, and I wanted to know what they actually look like if all three were together. With much surprise, and a bit of a snug fit, they did fit together. I like the fact that they had that seatbelt strap holder in the back of the headrest to secure them in the back seat. I have a 5 year old, 4 year old, and a1 year old. The car seats worked out just fine for each one of them due to the adjustable strap hole placements to secure them in. I would recommend these car seats if you need three car seats in a row based on their slender fit, and each one of them had their own cupholders. My daughter has a Volkswagen SUV. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17",

                "reviewText": "I am not an officiando of car restraining/safety seats. Nevertheless, this seat was one third the price of other seats. It is used to safely transport a very active toddler, aged 3 1/2, from preschool to home. The seat works just fine. He is comfortable, the seat is well secured in my Camry, so it is easy in and easy out. For all of this it may deserve a five, but it is good enough to warrant a 2 thumbs up review.",
