Unfortunately it had a very strong chemical smell out of the box that did not dissipate after airing it out for several days prior to installation. Once in the car, the smell is noticable the second we open the door. Called customer service and they immediately ordered me replacement padding/covers at no charge. Just bummed they say it will take 10-15 days to arrive as we are all subjected to this harsh chemical smell in the meantime. Also, the cup holders are a joke. They are TINY. I was looking forward to being able to put my little's water bottle within reach so he could be more independent while I drive, but I don't think these things could even hold a airplane cup they're so narrow. Overall, a good, but not great seat.",

You can simply lift them while your kid is in the car seat",

                "reviewText": "We were in need of a second car seat for our second vehicle and have only ever used a Nuna car seat. I was a bit nervous about trying something different, but this Maxi Cosi Pria All in One checked off so many boxes - safety, quality, longevity (only seat we will ever need) and style. Got it installed using the latch method, rear facing, in under a minute. Would be easy to move to a different vehicle if absolutely needed. Once installed the seat felt very sturdy and secure.We took it out for a short drive to see how our 13 month old liked it - the good news is she LOVED it! She had a bit more moving room in terms of the sides of the seat, but was well secured in her harness. The cup holders were a plus and she figured out how to sit her water cup in them right away.Have not had to take apart to wash fabric yet, so will have to give an update down the road. Overall very very happy with our purchase. Maxi Cosi does it again. Really feel like you get a ton of features and quality for the price.",
