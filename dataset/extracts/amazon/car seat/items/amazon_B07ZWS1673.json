The arms are cushy, and it has two nice cup holders for all the things. My daughter loves being in a big high back like her brother, and it was easy to adjust to her height. I have no problem getting the seatbelt to stay where it needs to, and she can get it all by herself every time now since she's had a little practice. I have a highlander and it looks nice in the car and sits flat against the seat as it's supposed to. It comes with the latch system and my husband loves the new way these unclick unlike the ones we've dealt with in the past with convertible and infant seats. I think we made a good buy.",

                "reviewText": "Bought three of these booster seats (2 Lilac and 1 Drift) to replace our heavy convertible car seats now that our twins are eight years old and ready for more of a big kid car seat. 2 seats are for main car when transporting both and 1 seat for the spare car when just transporting one kid. These are easy to put together and install. They are light weight too so transferring from one car to another will be a cinch. The kids seemed to like them and say they are comfortable. I read a review in which someone used the packing material to pad the seat more. I did the same with the thicker foam padding in the box. I cut to size and inserted between the seat and the cover. It helps tremendously with the comfort. Just took the kids on 9+ hour car trip without any complaints. The only complaint I have is now I have to help buckle my kids in. It's too difficult for them to get the seat belt around them and into the fastener. Other than that, they seem to be a great transition seat. My children are narrow framed so they fit easily within the seat. I can foresee if a child is larger boned, he or she may not find these seats comfortable so check the width before buying.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased a second of this car seat for a second car. Child is 8 (and on smaller side) and has plenty room to grow in this seat. Other belting only booster seats with or without a back are too wide on the bottom and the seat covers the part on the car that the belt snaps into. This seat is still wide and comfortable AND tapers at the back so the seat doesn't cover where the car belt clips in. We have this car seat in a 2016 Outback and a 2019 BMW 330 Sedan. Both have car belt snaps below into the seat of the car, which us nice because they are easy to find, but not when they are covered by a booster seat!This high back booster also has two drink cups which always have a water bottle, or snack or toy or mask in them. And it also has latch connectors which hold it very tightly in place. However, the way you tighten the clips is a strap in the front between the child's legs. It also has a button to loosen. My son was previously in a Chicco 5 point seat belt car seat that he got in and out of himself using a button in the same location as this button that will loosen the seat from it's latch position. Let your child know not to touch that button, especially if they were used to a similar button to remove themselves from a previous 5 point belt seat.This car seat also easily converts to a backless booster for travel. We haven't used it yet solely as a booster. My son may be out of it by the time we travel again.PROS:- Large comfortable wide seat with arm rests- Seat tapers at back so you (or child) can easily find the clip that the car seatbelt clips into- Two decent size cup holders that remove easily for cleaning- Separates into a backless booster for travel, or when child gets older- Has latch clips for extra secure safety of booster seatCONS:- Button for latch release is right in between child's legs and can easily be pressed by child (however, only intentionally, not by accident)UPDATE: I went to register this booster seat and looked at the manufacture date, and although I just bought it in 2021, it was manufactured in Nov 2019. Guessing a backlog of car seats not needed for 2020 with nobody going anywhere. Downside, this car seat will expire faster....",

                "reviewText": "I spent nearly 2 months reasearching car seats for our son who outgrew his Cybex Sirona. I joined several groups on Facebook, discussed with CPSTs and ended up buying this Chicco KidFit Zip Air Plus.I drive GMC Yukon so we have no issues with space but my main concern was how comfy this seat would be. We take long rides several times a month and the Cybex Sirona has been one of the best purchases ever given the fact it was super comfy and padded enough for him to never complain. When trying different seats, my son would complain about his butt hurting.So, we love this new seat - the leg rest is absolutely great, it's light and super easy to install, the cup holder is awesome and the snack box is a great attachment but note, it does fall out!Unfortunately, even when the seat padding is layered, it's nothing like the Cybex (that my daughter uses now) and my son does complain - not as much as with the other seats we tried but he does. I bought some gel pad that one CPST recommended and it does the job.I just wish more seats would use more cushion for long rides. We are keeping it but I am determined to try a few more seats to compare :)",
