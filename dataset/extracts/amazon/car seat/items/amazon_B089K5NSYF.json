This product has exceeded our expectations in every way, making long journeys with kids not just bearable but enjoyable.First and foremost, the installation is incredibly simple. The adjustable clamp securely attaches to the headrest, ensuring that the tablet mount stays in place even during bumpy rides. The versatility of this holder, compatible with a wide range of tablets and devices, is a huge advantage. We've used it with iPads, Galaxy Tabs, and other tablets, and it accommodates all of them effortlessly.The 360-degree rotatable ball joint allows for customized viewing angles, keeping the kids entertained and comfortable. Whether they're watching movies, playing games, or reading, the tablet remains at the perfect eye level.But what really sets this headrest holder apart is its sturdiness. It can withstand the enthusiastic tapping of little fingers and doesn't wobble or sag, even with larger tablets. The security strap is an added layer of protection, preventing accidental drops.The ability to free up our hands and keep our kids engaged during road trips has made our journeys much smoother. No more constant requests to hold the tablet, and no more distractions while driving. It's a safety and sanity saver!In conclusion, the Car Tablet Headrest Holder is a must-have road trip essential for any family. Its ease of use, compatibility, durability, and adjustable features make it an invaluable addition to our travel setup. This product has truly transformed our road trips and made them enjoyable for everyone. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "This was perfect for our 1.5 year old! She\u2019s in a rear facing car seat and I was able to attach it to the headrest below the mirror. She can watch movies easily. We are using an old iPhone SE. It fits perfectly and I can plug in a charger while it\u2019s in use so I never have to worry about the phone battery running out. It moves around easily to change orientation or direction but it\u2019s sturdy so it doesn\u2019t flop around or move unless you choose to move it. It\u2019s very easy to set up for the first time. And taking the phone in/out is also very easy. Well made product! Highly recommend!",
