                "reviewText": "I have a 5 year old and 6 year old who are 35 and 44 lbs. My 5 is 40.5 inches tall and my 6 year old is 47 inches . I initially bought the S and the L, thinking that 6 was going to be too tall for the S.It turns out, the L was wayyyyy too big for her and the S fit perfectly. Meanwhile, the S was too big for 5. So I quickly bought an XS for 5. It arrived and fit perfectly, just in type for us to go on vacation!My kids wore these vests for 3 weeks while we traveled around Europe. They worked well for us! Once we got the rhythm down, 6 was able to latch herself in completely (and I just checked to make sure it was right).We will continue to use the 5 point harness seats at home. They are more comfortable for the kids and- let's be honest- their bulk makes me feel like they're safer.However, these vests are perfect for traveling. We will also use them when they need to hop into someone else's car!",

                "reviewText": "This is a fantastic option for traveling if your child is big and old enough! We are really into car seat/booster safety, but we also travel a lot (wife is in airline industry). When our kid was younger it was easier, but once they get older it\u2019s such a pain to deal and travel with car seats, so we usually opted for trips like Disney or something where we wouldn\u2019t need a car seat by taking Magical Express, but frustrating sometimes because we would of loved to take one or two of the days out of vacation to go to the beach, or visit family 2 hrs south of Orlando but having to bring car seat just for that to then sit in room rest of trip and hassle of carrying it around airport/plane sucked. We follow the Car Seat for the Littles and would never use something they didn\u2019t approve of. Thankfully this is the ONLY safe and approved travel vest on the market (I will paste a link to their review down below). We finally got one and used for our first trip! It was so incredibly easy to carry around unlike a bulky car seat. It did take several YouTube videos and thoroughly reading instructions to get the hang out the vest, followed by sending pics to Car Seat for the Little page to verify we were installing and using correctly. Once we got the hang of it, it was super easy and quick. My kids only complaint was that you cant see out the window. I know they sell a booster seat that the vest can be used with (and only their booster), but it\u2019s sold out until late fall/early winter it looks like. Definitely will be purchasing for future use or if needed to ride in someone else\u2019s car. Highly recommend using the crotch strap for smaller kids, helped a ton, and using the top tether for smaller/younger kids (ours is 5.5yr but small). While this is a wearable booster, the tether helps a lot for kids who technically are booster ready, but are still in 5 point harness at home. Highly recommend for anyone who travels often or maybe switches cars sometimes, or other people or family driving kid every once in a while (I know I hate uninstalling and reinstalling car seat for one or two short drive or pick ups by family or friend every time, so this would be helpful for that too)!",

                "reviewText": "I was unsure about this travel vest. I bought it to save space in the back seat as we downsized our vehicle and to my surprise, I like this better than a traditional booster seat. My daughter age, 6 could easily unstrap herself or maneuver out of the traditional backless booster. Many times on hard turns she was leaning over practically falling out of the booster. With this travel vest, she goes nowhere! My hubby set it up with the tether and she is safer in this than a booster and I highly recommend! It's very portable, so no need for multiple car seats or switching car seats for different vehicles and great for travel.My only complaint is that it now takes longer for her to buckle up, but that's cuz she insists on doing it herself every single time and sometimes she struggles with some of the buckles but that's expected for a 6 yro that thinks she's 20. \ud83d\ude06Overall, I highly recommend this product, especially as a safer and better alternative than traditional booster.",
