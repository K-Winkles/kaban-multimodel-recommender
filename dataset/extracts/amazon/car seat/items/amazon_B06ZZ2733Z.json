These extra measures were taken in the production of this product to ensure the safety of every customer and baby. Invented by Brother and Sister The Car Seat Key was founded by a Brother and Sister Team. With Kristin being a former manicurist, she knew this was a common issue with clients. They also saw this common issue with their own mom, who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis. Knowing that this was a big safety problem, they started the invention process in the beginning of 2016 and have built the company to become a house hold name.",

I am also using it on a brand new car seat that is pretty difficult either way to press the center button. I will say it is a little clunky on your keychain another alternative that I tried was to loop it on the car seat itself because my daughter would just play with it anyway.
