                "reviewText": "Overall, this has been a good car seat. We have used it in multiple vehicles and with the sit n stand 2.0 stroller. It is convenient and a good value for its price. There are just a couple of cons that prevented me from giving it a perfect rating. A complete list of pros and cons is listed below:Pros:-Car seat is lightweight compared to many. -it is very easy to connect to the base. It clicks right in.-It is very easy to take out of the base. There is a release on the back, and if you push this and pull up while also holding either the handle or bottom, it comes right out.-It has an insert for smaller babies to help hold their heads in place.-It comes with a belt to latch it to the new latches in cars but can also be used with normal seatbelt in older cars.-There is a level on the side of the base to help keep it leveled. (This only is convenient if you put it in the passenger side of the car. You can\u2019t see it from the driver side door.)Cons:-baby trend says that their other products, such a as strollers, work with almost all of their car seats. However, this specific car seat is not compatible with many of the strollers, so make sure to look carefully if you\u2019re buying them separately. From my experience, if you\u2019re getting one of the sit n\u2019 stand strollers, you have to make sure to get the 2.0 version.-We have had a difficult time getting the base to stay level in the car.-The belt that comes with it is hard to tighten.-To buckle the baby in, you have to put the two bottom pieces of the clip together before putting them into the latch; this is quite difficult to do quickly.",
