                "reviewText": "I've had these seats for about 4 years. I have 2 with twins. I am reviewing it in the outboard position of a car since I cannot put just one in. Oh and I really don't think you can get 3 across in a smaller sedan. That's wishful thinking since there are not 3 sets of latch anchors in a car.Rear facing - car:Just like most rear facing seats, you won't have any legroom with one of these behind you. They were even quite large in my van. The base used for rear facing mode is not the greatest and adjustments are not really possible. It also really digs into the seat of the car. Not recommended. I didn't bother using it in this mode. My kids had outgrown their infant carriers, so front facing they went with these right away.Front facing harness - car:Not bad. The LATCH anchors worked as needed, but routing them can be a major pain in the butt since they fall through from one side to the other in a large opening. You will need to clean these, and you will probably take them out to do so, therefore some patience is needed. The harness itself functions okay. On several occasions the pull cord got stuck or was hard to pull. Competitors' seats are better here.Front facing harness - plane:Don't bother unless it's a short flight and the two of you have just 1 kid. My wife and I were coming back to ORD from an international flight of 9 hours. Having 2 tired kids, being tired ourselves, and then having to walk down the infamous corridors of ORD's terminal 5 was a dumpster fire. These seats are way to HEAVY for that. First, folding them up is less than intuitive when you're in a hurry, and then there is no good way to carry them. That was the first and last time I used them this way. The folding mechanism is completely unnecessary in a car, so there's really no point to it and it just adds complexity.Front facing booster - car:Not good here either. The shoulder belt routing is poor. The seat belt is very difficult for my kids to pull through. Also there isn't a good place to stow away the harnesses and latch belts. My Gracos are next level in that aspect. Since I have no plan to have any more kids, and not returning to harness mode, I just cut these all off.Cleaning:Again, not great. The covers should really be machine washable, but doing so is almost guaranteed to tear apart the mesh and felt-like fabric that is on the non-user-facing side.Summary:Would I buy these again? No. With my older kids I had a different brand. They were much more user friendly. I another car I have a pair of Graco seats - much better in every way. Well I guess they don't fit on a plane.",
