Purchased these seat covers having never done anything like this so a bit apprehensive about installing them on the seats. We have the back seat also so we had to do two seats and back rests. The color is beautiful and the stitching is excellent. As far as ease of installing we had no trouble at all. You first have to remove your old covers and remove all the staples from the boards. Then you install the new covers over the cushion and pull them tight. Once you get it positioned correctly you use your stapler to fasten them. I used a 3M heavy duty fastener/stapler to attach them and it quickly and easy. If you take your time and think it through it is a very easy replacement. Our cart looks much much better now.",

I quickly found that my skill set was not up to the task. I was very dissappointed. so I have to pay to get it done but thats not their fault so I give 5 stars to them and 1 to me",
