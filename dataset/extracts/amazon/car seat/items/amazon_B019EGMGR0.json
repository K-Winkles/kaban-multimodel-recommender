The Graco Extend2Fit Convertible Car Seat grows with your child from rear-facing harness (4-50 lbs) to forward-facing harness (22-65 lbs). It features a 4-position extension panel that provides up to 5\u201d of extra rear-facing legroom, allowing your child to safely ride rear-facing longer. Children are safer riding rear-facing and should ride rear-facing as long as possible, until they reach the maximum rear-facing height or weight rating for their car seat. With Extend2Fit, the adjustable extension panel and 50 lbs rear-facing weight limit allow the seat to grow with your child in rear-facing mode, providing extended rear-facing use. The seat features the No-Rethread Simply Safe Adjust Harness System, which allows you to adjust the height of the headrest and harness in one motion, and InRight LATCH for a one-second LATCH attachment. Harnessing is made easier with fuss-free harness storage pockets that conveniently hold the harness out of the way while you get baby in and out of the car seat. This car seat is Graco ProtectPlus Engineered to help protect in frontal, side, rear, and rollover crashes. Brand Story By Graco",

                "reviewText": "The car seat is so fast and easy to install that I originally ordered 2 to use for both of our cars and we ended up just using one and quickly swapping it back and forth. We will be able to use the extra one for when we travel to visit relatives. The seat is VERY adjustable, so you can really make it fit your baby/toddler. My girl very quickly outgrew the pumpkin seat and this was a great option for us, to be able to purchase one seat that would suit her as an infant and also as a toddler. I can tell you she is much more comfortable now and will sleep FOREVER in this seat!!! (Mom's take note.) I have been known to park in the garage for 30+ minutes with the classical music still playing and the car off because 'someone' fell asleep on the way home, just saying.Also, the cup holders on this car seat are placed well and deep enough that the cups stay in. I've had experience in the past with poorly designed cup holders on car seats. Either the child can't reach the cup or the cup won't even stay in, not the case with this seat.Finally, I would also like to mention the padding of this car seat. Not only does my baby girl look super comfy and sleep really well (as mentioned before) but the cushions are surprisingly perfectly designed to hide all the dumped snacks, keeping them from getting ground into clothes. At first I thought my girl was chowing.... I mean we would get to the store just 2 1/2 miles from the house and the snack cup would be empty and I'm looking like \"Where are all the snacks? How did you eat those that fast?\".... Now, mind you, we don't go on car rides every day, so this went on for weeks. Until I went to clean out the car and realized that all the snacks that I thought baby girl had been scarfing down, were IN the car seat, INVISIBLE. (Now, I've just been to the car wash but I will include a pic of the snack hiding spot.) BUUUT..... Now that I have discovered it, It's great!!!! It keeps the snacks from getting all crunched up and ground into clothes (because it's padded) and I can make the disappearing snacks reappear. Mommy Magic!",

                "reviewText": "I like that it is so easy to adjust the height for baby. No rethreading the shoulder straps. I like how comfortable my baby looks. My baby\u2019s legs can be stretched out instead of straight up like some other car seats. I looked at several reviews and articles and found that this was the best one for my tall baby. It was easy to install by myself with the tethers. I also like that I will not have to buy my baby another seat because it converts all the way to booster. I couldn\u2019t be happier with this purchase. I went for the darkest color possible to avoid easy stains. This is a very sturdy car seat and it is a little on the heavier side, but I won\u2019t be installing and reinstalling often so it\u2019s not a factor. I still chose this over slimmer car seats and rotating car seats because I was prioritizing my baby\u2019s comfort. I highly recommend because now my baby looks comfortable and doesn\u2019t cry every time I put my baby in the car seat.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars My favorite car seat!",
                "reviewText": "WOW I love this car seat! We have 3 kids (5, 3, 1) and have owned 11 car seats. This is our first Graco - we\u2019ve owned/own seats from Chicco, Clek, Safety First, Maxi Cosi and Diono. I\u2019ve installed varying combinations of these seats in over 10 cars, including our vehicles, grandparent vehicles and rental cars. This is my favorite car seat and here\u2019s why:- IT\u2019S (comparatively) EASY TO INSTALL. All car seats are a pain to install but this is actually one of the easiest seats I\u2019ve installed. The level is easy to read, so you know you\u2019ll get the angle right. The way they\u2019ve set up the LATCH straps means it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll get them twisted. I have no explanation as to why, but I installed it tightly on the first try, which never happens (even with the seats I know really well and have been installing for years).- IT\u2019S COMMON. This is important for anyone that does run into trouble installing: because this seat is so common, it\u2019s easy to find dozens of how-to videos on YouTube that will walk you through the installation and help you troubleshoot any issues.- HIGH REAR-FACING WEIGHT LIMIT. This is probably why most folks buy this seat and it was certainly a selling factor for us. The 50lb rear-facing weight limit means all 3 of my kids can rear face in this seat.- HIGH WEIGHT LIMIT FOR LATCH. This isn\u2019t something I even paid attention to until my kids got older and it\u2019s important! You can use LATCH to install this seat up to 45lbs!!! All of our other seats only allow LATCH up to 30 or 35lbs, which means we have to switch to seat belt installation. It\u2019s not a huge deal but it\u2019s a pain because you have to remember to switch the installation when your child gets over the limit (and actually remember the limit). I prefer LATCH installation so I\u2019m thrilled we get to use LATCH install for almost as long as we can rear-face.- NO RETHREAD HARNESS! This is huge. Kids grow fast and it is a massive pain to uninstall and reinstall car seats when you need to adjust the straps. With this seat, you can just adjust the headrest without removing the entire car seat. I love it!!- IT\u2019S GREAT FOR TALL PARENTS! My husband is 6\u20195\u201d and all of our rear facing seats have required him to move up his seat when driving... except this one! In one of the photos, you can see the Graco Extend2Fit is installed rear-facing next to Clek Foonf (also rear-facing). The Clek takes up substantially more space front-to-back than the Graco, which surprised me because our Clek takes up less space front-to-back than our other rear-facing car seats. Not only can my husband adjust his seat the way he likes, he\u2019s got leg room to spare!- IT\u2019S AFFORDABLE. Even if it didn\u2019t have all these other great features, it\u2019s one of (if not the most) cost effective car seats for rear-facing to 50lbs. Now that I own one, I think it\u2019s a total steal of a deal!- IT HAS 2 GREAT CUP HOLDERS. I was worried because one of the comments on here claimed that no cups fit in the cup holders. Our child\u2019s water bottle fits just fine. It\u2019s snug but I prefer that because it won\u2019t annoyingly rattle around when we\u2019re driving. I like that there are two cup holders because kiddo can keep toys in the other one.- IT HAS A WASHABLE COVER. Just like installation, all car seat covers are a pain to remove and wash. I think all of our car seats have been thrown up on (usually in the middle of nowhere when we have nothing to clean them up) so I have a lot of experience in this area. Removing the Graco cover is just as easy to remove as other seats. It\u2019s not as easy to remove as the Chicco Zip line but we don\u2019t have to wash the cover so frequently that I feel like I need that feature.- IT HAS A PLACE TO STORE THE BUCKLES. Not all car seats have this and it\u2019s one of my favorite features: there is a nice place to put the buckles so that it\u2019s a little bit easier to buckle kiddo next time because they aren\u2019t sitting in the buckles when they get into the seat. It\u2019s a small thing but I love it.- IT ISN'T OVERLY HEAVY. I can barely lift our Clek because it\u2019s so heavy. The Graco is certainly sturdy but I can still move it.Here is why we didn\u2019t buy it sooner (aka downsides):- IT\u2019S TOO WIDE TO DO 3 ACROSS. Maybe there is a specific configuration that can make this work but we couldn\u2019t. Our Diono and Clek easily allow us to fit 3 kids across the backseat. We got the Graco because we finally bought a minivan and didn\u2019t have to fit 3 kids in the same row. Obviously this isn\u2019t a factor for smaller families or families with larger vehicles.- THE OVERALL APPEARANCE IS MEDIOCRE. It certainly isn\u2019t ugly but many other car seats on the market are more attractive. I also wish the straps weren\u2019t visible on the back.The pros of this seat far outweigh the cons. I absolutely love this seat and I\u2019ve recommended it to everyone that\u2019s asked about it since we\u2019ve purchased it. I\u2019m really impressed by the features.",

Mejor comprar uno ya que se requiera, con la tecnolog\u00eda actualizada.
