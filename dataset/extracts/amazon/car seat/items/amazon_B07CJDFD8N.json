                "reviewText": "We only use this seat sometimes in our spare car, but it seems to work great. It is very easy to install and move because it is so light weight. Having to adjust the harness height manually is a bit of a pain because you have to uninstall the seat to adjust the harness, but if you are only using it for one child it isn't a big deal. We are using it in a spare car for two different children so I have to adjust the height of the harness almost every time I use the seat, but the installation of is so easy that I don't mind doing it. Both kids are very comfortable in the seat and have fallen asleep/stayed asleep with no problems during car rides. The cup holders are deep and spacious and their cups stay in without falling out during the drive. Great seat for the budget conscious or if you just need a spare seat like we did.",

                "reviewText": "We bought this for my 2.5 when we travel on airplanes. We use it on her seat because she will not sit still in just the airline seat. Its very lightweight and easy to transport through the airport. If your child is tall I would definitely recommend getting extra legroom because the way the car seat is positioned their feet are VERY close to the seat in front of her. The cup holders are great, but they seem to pop out easily. The seat itself isn't very padded so she doesn't fall asleep as easily in it as her normal car seat but it serves its purpose for vacations. In my opinion a lot easier that having a finicky toddler on a plane AND renting a car seat at our destination. It had the best ratings for the weight so I went with this one over a few others I had seen on amazon. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars for safety features is because its SO lightweight I'm not really sure how it would hold up in an accident. My current GRACO car seat feels like a tank in comparison to this.",
