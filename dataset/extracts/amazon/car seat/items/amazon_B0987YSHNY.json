The unique patented rotation brings your child 10 inches closer to you, and helps you maintain a more upright posture when lifting your child in and out and buckling them into the car seat. The seat smoothly rotates with one hand, then audibly clicks into place for assurance that it is safely secured. The car seat converts from rear-facing harness (4-50 lb) to forward-facing harness (22-65 lb) to grow with your child. Soft, lightweight fabrics featuring COOLMAX moisture-wicking material will help keep your child cool and comfortable. Like your favorite workout wear, it's cooling and resistant to wrinkling and fading over time. The integrated RAPIDLOCK belt-tensioning technology and push-button LATCH make for a simple and secure installation in seconds. A 10-position headrest and 6-position recline ensure a comfy ride, and the no-rethread harness means you can adjust the harness without removing it. This seat has been tested with TRUE Test Plus safety standards, engineered to help protect your child in rollover, side, front, and rear collisions.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The first thing i noticed about this car seat is that it came in a super large and heavy box. The car seat I was previously using was a Gracco and it weighed 10lbs-so I wasn\u2019t expecting this. Thank goodness my super brought the box up my 4 flight walk up! When you remove the car seat from the box it has significant weight- which I guess is normal for stationary car seats. So I would suggest having someone around that can help carry the box.The car seat itself is absolutely beautiful! The color, and cushioning really stand out. The car seat comes with instructions as well as a quick install guide- which I thought was cool. I read the entire manual and felt comfortable installing the car seat. My boyfriend (who is a firefighter) would normally do this but he was away on business and I needed to install the car seat ASAP since I already donated the old one. For added safety I watched a few install videos I found online and on YouTube.My son is over 25lbs and I decided to place the car seat forward facing. Per the instructions you can use this care seat in rear facing until 40lbs (I think) but I decided to forward face. The installation was very easy. The only trouble I had was that my car is an older model suv and I couldn\u2019t locate where the tether strap anchors were located. After some googling I figured out they were in the back of the seat located in the trunk. So if you are forward facing I suggest checking on that before you try installing.Once I figured that out installation was super easy!So far my son is super comfortable and seems very happy during our car rides. Everything on this car seat is convenient and easy to operate.Overall this car seat is amazing!",

                "reviewText": "You would be suprised how many \"turn to me\" car seats are ridiculously difficult to turn to you. This one is so so easy, it takes no effort at all. The quality is really nice and my girl gets the biggest smile whenever I put her in it. I wish it had a higher weight limit for the forward facing mode, but I honestly only think the turning function is useful when they are rear facing anyway. I will probably just hand this one down for the next babies. It's super convenient for rear facing.",

                "reviewText": "I moved my baby from the Chicco KeyFit 30 to this car seat around 14 months. I really wanted a safe car seat that rotated & this was the only one on consumer reports list that met my criteria of: best crash protection, 50lb rear-facing, rotates. I\u2019ve had it for about a month and love it so far. We have it in a RAV4 and while my 6\u20191\u201d husband would like to recline the passenger side a bit more, it\u2019s still comfortable.It\u2019s heavy so it\u2019s not something you\u2019re going to want to move around often. I was pretty confused on how to get it installed but when I finally figured out how to do it correctly it\u2019s not hard.If you compare specs on this via the Graco extend to fit & other similar, this baby jogger is surprisingly slim.",

                "reviewText": "I have two rotating car seats, this one and the Cybex one. This one does some things better than the Cybex but it does some things worse. In my search for the perfect car seat\u2026this one is good but could be better. If I had to buy another one, I would probably go try the Nuna or the Graco versions (Evenflo out of the running) and hope that they\u2019ve addressed some of the issues mentioned below.PRO - This thing is super easy to install. I was able to get it really secure in the captains chair of an SUV without issues. Way easier than my Cybex.PRO - The turning mechanism is super easy to do with one hand. This is important when you\u2019ve got a wiggly baby in the other arm.PRO - Built in cup holder. Fits the camelbak toddler bottles perfectly.PRO - The whole point of the turning car seat is to help make it easier to get your kid into the car, and this definitely fits the bill. I have a bad back and this thing is a lifesaver compared to other non-turning seats. I\u2019ll never go back to non-rotating seats, given the choice.PRO - Slightly lower profile than the Cybex because it doesn\u2019t have the load leg. But it\u2019s still a large car seat.CON - The padded cover for the between-leg strap isn\u2019t attached and just comes flying off every time you take the kid out. Completely unusable trash. Kid may be uncomfortable if they aren\u2019t wearing shorts.CON - The seat turns not from the center, but from the back, so it swings out over the door threshold when it\u2019s turned. This means you cannot close the door to some cars when it is turned. Which means while you\u2019re holding the child you just took out of the car, you have to rotate the car seat back. Super annoying, and was not an issue with other turning car seats. This also means that younger toddlers will be unable to climb up into their seat for much longer. My 2.5 year old can get into the Cybex and her non turning Nuna by herself, but cannot get into the city turn. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve tried to close the car door only to have it bounce open. We have a LARGE SUV with captains chairs.CON - The seatbelts are short so they do NOT stay out of the way when trying to fasten the child in. You always have to fish them out from behind the child. There\u2019s no magnets or clips or pockets like other seats have to help keep them out of the way. The chest clap feels a little cheaply made.CON - Recline can\u2019t be adjusted on the fly like the Cybex can. Car seat has to be uninstalled to do that, but luckily this isn\u2019t something I need to do often so it\u2019s not a big issue. You\u2019ll probably need to do it once between the child\u2019s age of 0-6m.In conclusion, I would buy this car seat over the Cybex Sirona S BUT I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best revolving car seat on the market. If you get it as a gift or get a good coupon for it, by all means\u2026you\u2019ll love it. And if you\u2019ve never had a rotating car seat before\u2026you\u2019ll love it. But it has some flaws and I think they need to address these. It\u2019s possible you could figure out a solution for a couple of them or perhaps installing it in a different type of car would address the swinging-out-too-far issue for some, but these at the issues that affect me.",
