Of course this can be used at any time because it holds children the same as any other carseat, as far as my understanding goes. The design is very cute and seems to be more comfortable than other types of car seats. Installation was pretty straightforward. I definitely recommend this product because of how it looks how easy it is to install and how well it works.",

The first time I used just the booster, I had some trouble getting the other pieces off. Could be just me though. This car seat is lightweight and not difficult to get in and out of the vehicle. It's adequately padded and spills wipe up easily. It has two drink holders which is a major plus. I like the style and would definitely recommend to fam and friends. Quality is on par for $159.99.",

                "reviewText": "This carseat is definitely not the easiest to install. The top comes apart from the bottom very easily. You have to lay the pieces flat, insert the top into the bottom piece, and then fold it upwards to lock them together. The issue is that they don't lock. Nothing clicks into place. No buttons. If you don't hold it together, the pieces will come apart. I liked that it came with the anchor pieces, but the seat is made in a way that makes it impossible to use them. You cannot tighten them enough because they are too far behind the seat. You dont have enough space to get your hand close to pull tight. I had to just use the seatbelt. It's also not very well padded. It's okay, but not great. It does come with an extra padding piece, but it won't fit a bigger kid. I would not recommend this on road trips. On the plus side, it's easy to raise and lower the chest straps. It's just a squeeze button on the top. So overall, it's light and good for travel via airplane or something, but I wouldn't use it for a road trip. It's also relatively thin, so you could put 3 in a backseat easily.",

I finally asked her about it to find out that she\u2019s been using a hand me down booster that\u2019s WAY above what my 22 month old should be using because he hates this car seat so much. Our normal car seats are a Britax and a Maxi Cosi and he never cries about the car seats in our vehicles. She said he hates this car seat and not only dries but grabs onto the and screams when they try to put him in it. We can\u2019t seem to lap the two pieces together unless they\u2019re strapped into a car. Which doesn\u2019t seem altogether safe and is also just annoying. It feels like good materials and seems to be well made but it\u2019s kind of a waste since we can\u2019t use it.",
