For starters, the safety ratings were good, it\u2019s very lightweight, the installation was super easy- normally I have my fianc\u00e9 do the installation because car seats and I do not mesh well lol- I installed this, alone, in a snap. Adjusting the backrest for height is simple and requires almost no effort. Taking the back off, to make it a backless booster, can be accomplished in seconds. My 6yo daughter says it\u2019s comfortable. She loves the colors and the cup holders. Also, the arm rests are actually a decent size. Some of the booster seats on the market have these ridiculous arm rest, too short and too narrow, not sure what those companies are thinking. These are wide enough for her to actually set her arm on and long enough too. I was concerned about it being too big for my Jeep. My backseats are pretty small/narrow and most car seats are too big for them, but with a little wiggling and tightening, it fits perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these booster seats because my daughter's 6 & 5 year olds were out growing their car seats. The modern sleek look of these seats had me stopping and reading the reviews and although some stated they were on the big side, I took a chance on them and I'm so glad I did. I have an older model Honda Odyssey and the seats fit perfectly. They were easy to assemble as you snap together the top and bottom part which were separated in the box. It was pretty simple to hook them in my van as I attached the two ancore hooks on the bottom of the booster seat to the van's seat. The seats are sturdy once strapped in correctly and don't move around. Then I weaved the seat belt through the hole in the booster chair as seen in pic. They feel nice, look nice, and have good safety features as the sides are wide enough for protection and comfort. They also have two pull out cup holders on both sides of the seats that can fit juice boxes and snacks. These seats are really nice as I've gotten complaments from other moms about them too, so if you have the room these booster seats are great to have.",

                "reviewText": "My daughter still sits in her Diono Radian 5 point harness seat in our main vehicle, but I wanted something in our secondary vehicle without spending another $$$ on a second big seat. This is perfect for quick trips, as she fits all the requirements to sit in this seat. The color is fantastic. The latch system makes it a breeze to install into the vehicle. The car seat belt positions perfectly when my child is buckled in. I love that both cup holders can be folded in when not in use. I wish this was around back when my older kids were in car seats. Definitely recommend this seat for children who are old enough/ big enough to sit in a booster seat.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My daughter and I have been getting in car fights since she\u2019s been in a literal backward facing car seat, absolutely hates getting buckled wishes she could just run free throughout the car. So when she finally was eligible for a booster seat, over 40 pounds, I knew I was going to get one she loved so we could eliminate at least half of the tantrums. Obviously, this is a little bit more expensive than the average booster seat but I was thinking of investment since it would be one that she was going to have for years to come. Plus I have an infant daughter who would use it after her. She chose this car seat based on its color, pink, her favorite. And I chose it based on Safety and easy installation. We love this booster. It has so much room for growth so I definitely think it will make it till she\u2019s six or seven years old and it\u2019s very durable. We\u2019ve had it for over six months at this point and it still looks brand new, the two cupholders on the side can be pushed in or pulled out which I love so they don\u2019t get all funky With old candy or old snacks. And it isn\u2019t a complete eyesore in my car so 10 out of 10 recommend.",

The cup holders can be stowed away when not in use and you are able to remove the high back later on to make it a backless booster. The lower latch anchors give me a little piece of mind and probably also helps prevent any shaking as you drive without your child in the seat. It is super easy to install it took me maybe 2 minutes to put it in my car. Very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this booster to anyone.",
