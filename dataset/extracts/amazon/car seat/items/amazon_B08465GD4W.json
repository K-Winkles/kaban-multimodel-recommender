Loved the look of this seat.Dislikes: a hard shell and a cover that is not plush and falls off.She complains it is not comfortable, so ultimately to keep the peace in the car we ended up having another seat! We ended up purchasing another highback booster. Which the back clicks in and stays attached. Century is the brand.This frozen boosters back does not attach. So it literally ia juat sitting back there- notattached. It feels like more of a danger than anything.Removed the always detached back. Seat moves around too much on the seat.This seat is a waste of money. If they love frozen, buy them a frozen toy to sit in a different seat with them!",

Lo que me gusta de este asiento es que mantiene presionado el cintur\u00f3n de seguridad para que no quede en la cara o el cuello de los ni\u00f1os. El asiento coloca el cintur\u00f3n de seguridad en una posici\u00f3n c\u00f3moda para los ni\u00f1os.Una vez que su hijo es m\u00e1s alto y puede colocar su cintur\u00f3n de seguridad por s\u00ed solo, puede quitar la parte posterior del asiento y usar la parte inferior del asiento solo para elevarlo. Esto es probablemente para cuando su hijo tiene alrededor de 6-7.Este asiento es ideal para ni\u00f1os mayores que han crecido fuera de su asiento original. No es bueno para beb\u00e9s o ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os, ya que no ofrece la protecci\u00f3n adecuada para ellos.",
