        "description": "The Graco\u00ae SlimFit\u00ae 3-in-1 Car Seat grows with your child, from rear-facing harness (5-40 lb) to forward-facing harness (22-65 lb) to highback booster (40-100 lb). It saves space in your back seat, while giving your child plenty of room to grow. The unique, rotating cup holders simply rotate away, making the seat 10% slimmer to save precious back seat space. The Simply Safe Adjust\u2122 Harness System means you can easily adjust the harness and headrest together, to accommodate your growing child with ease. With 4 recline positions, you can keep your child comfortable, while the InRight\u2122 LATCH system makes installation easy with a one-second attachment. The seat is Graco\u00ae ProtectPlus Engineered\u2122 to help protect your little one in frontal, side, rear, and rollover crashes. Rear-Facing Harness: 5-40 lb, head must be at least 1\" below handle; Forward-Facing Harness: 22-65 lb, up to 49\"; Highback Booster: 40-100 lb, 43-57\", at least 4 years old. STOP using this child restraint and throw it away 10 years after the date of manufacture. Recommended Use] Children are safer riding rear-facing and should ride rear-facing as long as possible, until they reach the maximum rear-facing height or weight rating for their car seat. Then children should ride forward-facing, using the built-in harness system for as long as possible until they reach the maximum forward-facing weight or height for their car seat. At that point, children should ride in a belt-positioning booster seat. A booster is no longer needed once the vehicle seat belt fits properly, typically when they reach 4 feet 9 inches tall and are between ages 8-12. Be sure to check your local and state laws, as well as AAP and NHTSA recommendations, for car seat usage.* *Graco Supports the American Academy of Pediatrics and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Car Seat Guidelines.

                "reviewText": "I bought this because it is one of the safest car seats on the market in 2021.Note that this is very similar to the bulkier Graco Extend2Fit (the bigger one that performed better on crash tests.)This installed the same as the Graco Extend2Fit, except it is lighter and slimmer.Both car seats have an easy to read \"ball in tube\" level and EPS foam.What i love about this is the size makes it very convenient for my compact car.The headrest and incline is very easy to adjust.No-Rethread Simply Safe Adjust\u2122 Harness System allows the headrest and harness to adjust together in one motion.I wish I had bought this sooner!It fits kids from 5 pounds to 100 pounds.The Graco SlimFit 3-in-1 Convertible Car Seat converts from rear-facing harness (5-40 lb) to forward-facing harness (22-65 lb) to highback booster (40-100 lb). It has a durable steel frame & shock-absorbing foam for protection from impact. The two integrated cup holders rotate away for more space.Soft seating is comfortable & easy to clean and machine washable. Meets or exceeds the child restraint criteria for a frontal crash test under the US FMVSS 213.Side-impact tested for occupant retention with the built-in 5-point harness system and in highback belt-positioning modes.One very minor thing that irked me is The Graco InRight LATCH system makes it easy to secure using the LATCH within the seats of newer cars... but the LATCH strap included with all Graco car seats is too small for my two vehicles and my sister's vehicle. It isn't a big deal because I just use the middle seat belt to secure the car seat and it's still pretty easy to install and tighten.Tip from me: To make sure both staps are even, Graco straps have to be loosened and pulled straight out before the kid sits down.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this carseat when my little one outgrew her infant seat. I drive a prius and every centimeter of space counts! I actually think 3 of these might fit across my tiny backseat. I have a huge baby (think 3 year old at half the age) and this still has plenty of space to grow with her.Pros -- Comfort! My little one has never complained or seemingly suffered from a sore bum, even with 4 hours on the road. The seat is very plush and the thick head pads grow with your kiddo.- Cup hoooolders! It's right there, folks. And they fold in. I have found the cup holders fit every brand of sippy I have.- Easy installation. I had no idea how to install this thing (we're out of the realm of bases and clicking in now) and still managed to have it secured and adjusted in like 5 minutes.- Easy adjustments. So easy. I literally transitioned from rear to forward facing halfway through a trip. It was quick and easy. The headrest is the easiest to adjust, while the base acts allows you to adjust the recline of the seat.- Easy cleanup. I've found crumbs don't tend to get under the holes for straps, and I can just brush out or vacuum food bits. I've had two liquid food spills and baby wipes took the stains right up. Supposedly the fabric can be removed and washed, but I can't vouch for that or the process.- Has multiple install methods. Like the Graco infant seat I had before it, this car seat works with every kind of seat belt and the latch system.Cons -- This is not for infants. It advertises being good at 5 lbs, but my daughter would've been utterly eaten by this thing with space for rolling around at that size. I definitely recommend an infant seat first.- It's tall. The base that allows it to go between angles adds a little bit of height. It's not really noticeable, but items dropped are out of reach of the child. May be a pro depending on what's in your backseat.- The recline angles can be tricky. I could never get the rear facing to sit at the angle the seat wanted (it has the leveling tool built in), and now that it's forward facing it reads that it's perfect for rear facing. I'm left just going ????. My daughter seems comfortable so bah on it.That's it. I'm blessed enough to not know how it holds up in a car accident but I am confident in its ability to keep my lil one safe. Unless you see an update to my review in a few years stating otherwise, this is the carseat I'll have until my little one outgrows all seats and boosters.",

I already had an Extend2Fit 2-in-1 in one of our vehicles that I absolutely adored so I knew I wanted something similar to that for the other vehicle. So glad I chose this one!! It is easy to install, easy to clean, easy to adjust. It is lightweight enough that I don\u2019t mind changing it to another vehicle if I need to, and the color is dark enough to hide all her spill stains (a very lovely color of purple). I keep recommending it to friends who are looking to upgrade their infant carriers. I love that it can grow with her and that it has a good safety rating!",
