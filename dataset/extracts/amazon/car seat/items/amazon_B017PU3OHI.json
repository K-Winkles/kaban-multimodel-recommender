However, we\u2019ve used this little gizmo for over a year now and it was a really good buy! My now 7 yr old is a little guy and will probably be in a 5 pt harness until college. He lacks the strength needed to unbuckle himself and sits in the third row, too far for me to help. Buckle bee to the rescue! He can unbuckle himself quickly with ease and appreciates the independence. The only negative is it occasionally comes off, but is easy (for my son) to put back. We wish it came in more colors too (my 4 yr old thinks there should be a red buckle ladybug).",

We have 5 dionos and this is the only one that has ever had a broken anything, and also the only one we use the bucklee on.",
