        "description": "Product Description The Graco TurboBooster LX Highback Booster Seat with Latch System helps safely transport your big kid from 40 to 100 lb* and up to 57 inches tall. This 2-in-1 seat converts from a highback to a backless booster as your big kid grows. It provides a secure connection to your vehicle seat with its one-hand, front-adjust Latch System, making self-buckling easier for your independent child. While the purpose of the Latch** in the Booster is to secure the booster to the vehicle seat while the booster is unoccupied and help facilitate independent buckling, you will secure your child in the booster seat with the vehicle lap/shoulder belt. The seat has an integrated cup holder and hideaway storage compartment to keep your child's drinks and favorite things within arm's reach. This seat is Graco ProtectPlus Engineered to help protect your child in frontal, side, rear & rollover crashes. *To continue to meet industry standards, we have increased the weight minimum from 30 to 40 lb **Since the Latch system only secures the booster seat to the vehicle in this application and is not used for installation, it may be used regardless of the weight of the child (up to the maximum weight recommendation of the seat).

                "reviewText": "Love this booster seat! It's solid and sturdy, yet lightweight and perfect for traveling. Set up and installation was very easy. I use it with the latch system (to keep the seat tethered while not in use) and with the back in place. The back helps to position the seat belt just right for those who are on the lower range of the weight limit. The back also offers side impact protection. In addition, the sides on the back are very practical for little ones who fall sleep (particularly on long trips). My little one loves this \"big kid\" booster seat and loves the cup holder. In terms of space, while it is not as large as some other boosters, it does still take a bit of real estate away from the other two seats in a standard size sedan. My kid has a hard time clicking the seat belt into place (which certainly is a minus in the independence department, but I suspect that this will change as the child grows and as they get accustomed to the new booster seat. Overall, I am happy with this purchase. I know that my child is protected and comfortable in this booster. I highly recommend it.",

At first I thought they forget the cup holder but they actually have it under the base so you have to look under the base. I seen some reviews where people were saying the back wasn\u2019t staying up and I\u2019m not having those issues. So far we like it and I\u2019m going to order one for the hubby\u2019s car and my mom is going to order one as well. I like how the back can come over or you can use the bottom so you can a two for one and it\u2019s for a great price. I was nervous with all the reviews but so far I\u2019m liking it and glad I got it. My daughter feels like a big girl now",

Basically, it's the red one.This will take about 5 minutes to assemble and install.Contains the seat, lower back section and adjustable upper section.The upper section has a loop for the seat belt strap to easily slide in to allow proper wear for our grandson.Also has \"captain\" arm rests.**This is the only complaint and it may be an oversight from the factory**This particular purchase was missing the snap-in cup holder.I will contact the factory (or Amazon) and ask for it to be shipped separately.I hope they do not require to send \"the entire package back\" as that will be very inconvenient.I will update if there is more.**Still I highly recommend this booster seat for your 4 to 9/10 yr old**",
