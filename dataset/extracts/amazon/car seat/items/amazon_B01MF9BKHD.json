My concerns were getting a close fit because of the age of the cart, 1992, and possibly wood damage from age and water. We also ordered a manual hand stapler kit with staple remover and staples. Good instructions but the best part was \" FOR BEST RESULTS GET A PROFESSIONAL\". Well, I'm no professional and this was my first attempt at any kind of seat repair. T50 staples were used. The hardest part was actually removing the old staples. Think I counted about a zillion of them. Fit and finish were perfect on bench seat and back rests. Totally satisfied with this product and the results I got!!!",

This is for a 1999 Club Car DS. I didn't remove the original covers, just simply installed over them. I did it by myself with a screw driver, a socket and ratchet, and a staple gun. Took about an hour and a half, with a day in between 'cause I chose to paint the seat backs while I had them off. I do recommend leaving the covers out in the sun for a while before working with them, they come folded up and this helps the creases go away easier. Well worth the money in you wanna freshen up those old worn golf cart seats.",
