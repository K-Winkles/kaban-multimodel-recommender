                "reviewText": "I bought this booster seat after reading numerous online reviews about it and watching how well it did in crash tests. When I unboxed it, I had a twenty minute battle getting the extra cushioning side pieces on because I had to push them into styrofoam and then slide them down to lick them in place. I have high doubts that they will do anything except fly off if there was a crash. It was between this booster seat and the Clek Oobr and I wish that I had shelled out the extra money for the Clek. I really like the patented adjustable reclining headrest on this booster, and how easy it was to install this booster seat. I don't like that the top part where you put the seat belt in at the shoulder is cheap, flimsy plastic. I'm going to keep this seat and it's going to stay in grandma's car.",
