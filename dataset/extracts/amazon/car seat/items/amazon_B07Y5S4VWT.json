                "reviewText": "We use this car seat for our newborn and now, and it has been a blessing! It\u2019s gentle on our baby\u2019s back as it has soft materials on its surface, and the positioning and curve of the seat base is comfortable for our baby. Only flaw would be the canopy is flimsy and we wish it came with a visor of some sort to keep it standing and out of our baby\u2019s face. Outside that, it\u2019s a great car seat and securely fastens into the car. The clips also easily close and don\u2019t cause strain to our baby.",

                "reviewText": "This car seat was used with my 3 year old when she was born and I have purchased it again for our second who is due soon. I absolutely loved this car seat. It\u2019s light and easy to carry. It does get a little uncomfortable to carry as baby gets heavier, but that\u2019s expected. It was very easy to install the base and to connect and disconnect the seat from the base, but hard for me to uninstall the base after it\u2019s tightened, but I do have that issue with any base. It has so many uses as well. We loved that you can remove the car seat from the base and also the fact that I was able to attach the seat to my stroller from Graco. This car seat was used on so many car rides and twice as many walks. We were able to use it for a good long while with my daughter and only stopped use once she got too big. I didn\u2019t have any regrets on not getting a more expensive seat, this fit all our needs. Definitely recommend this seat, especially at the price! You won\u2019t regret it.",

Now, I just stay home with her whenever it's not necessary for us to go somewhere to avoid the fight.",
