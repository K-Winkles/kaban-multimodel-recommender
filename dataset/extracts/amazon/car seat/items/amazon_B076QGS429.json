I love that it includes the latch system so the seat doesn't move around when my daughter gets in and out of the car. It is easy to assemble, easy to adjust and extremely easy to install in the car. I love that the liner zips off and is machine washable. It has great safety ratings, but is also quite light. We own britax boulevard and diono radian convertible seats which are awesome but heavy, so this is a nice change! I have not had any of the issues with the seatbelt coming out of the belt path or failing to tighten as some other reviewers have stated. For child size reference, my daughter is 5 yrs old, 43 lbs and 44 inches tall and this seat works perfectly for her.",

Convertible from high back to just lower booster4. Modern looks, comfortable, high safety standards.5. Wide weight rangeOur little guy loves this seat. Keeps him in a good seating position and the sides of the backrest fit great around the shoulder/head area. The bottom has a lot of cushioning and stays pretty cool. The latch system makes installation to the car very simple.Not sure why people say that their seatbelt won\u2019t retract or falls out of the shoulder guide on the seat, but I have had zero issues with either. The belt stays put where it should.A cool feature that was a surprise to us is that they send you two different sets of armrest covers, in two different fabrics. This may come in really handy when something spills later down the road.",

My 4 year old is switching from Recaro convertible, he is taller than average and was needing more shoulder and head height in back rest.This is my first ever Chicco, I am quite impressed.This seat hits every point for me, safety, comfort, easy to clean, easy to install, extras no charge, price point.Safery first, great shoulder and head support, not bulky at all. Super easy to install, very comfy only ride for the kid. I was looking for extra padded seat and this car seat has it and then some. Great for long rides.Fits perfect in my Pilot, my son get get in and out now with easeall by himself.Comes with some extras, witch we usually need to purchase separate, little bonus there already - storage tray and extra pair of arm rest covers. Price point $$$ out of $$$$$. My 1st pick would of been Recaro but it retails for $600, so this seat comes at fraction of the cost.I would highly recommend!!!",

My boys LOVE that attachment. It gives them a great place to keep all their \u201ctreasures\u201d, stash a few small toys, or hold their snacks. Chicco makes a great product in general, but that cup holder attachment is what won us over twice on this seat.",

                "reviewText": "A very nice booster seat. 1 star less because the side impact padding, by the ears, feels like it could be padded a little better. However, the seat and back are nicely padded. My daughter said it is very comfortable. She likes the little box (snack box) to hide stuff in. I like how even on the shortest setting, the shoulder belt is open and slides easily. I've tried using other seats that on the shortest setting, the seatbelt guide goes below the padded shoulder area and the seatbelt doesn't slide smoothly. I don't have a problem with this one. Also the cinch strap to hook it into the LATCH is so very easy to install. My daughter is 6 yrs old.",

                "reviewText": "My son LOVES this car seat/booster! It\u2019s easy to install and I love that it clips to the seat like a car seat would. We also bought the Chicco booster that doesn\u2019t have the back but still has the clips for the seat for my husbands car. It also works great. My 4 year old (47lbs and very tall) is not usually in my husbands car more than once or twice a week for 5 minutes so that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t buy two of these. But I love all the chicco car seats and boosters we own. Solid product.",
