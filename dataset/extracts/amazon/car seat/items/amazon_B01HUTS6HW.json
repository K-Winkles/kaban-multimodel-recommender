                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. 8th gen (\u201806) honda civicReally just posting this to help out the next person in the way that this review would\u2019ve helped me out when shopping. Long story short it was a used car the previous owner didn\u2019t even clean ever and the seats had cig burn marks, caked leg/head sweat etc. (many hours of cleaning). I already wanted seat covers but definitely after that. Used car probs *shrug.* After looking at many sets of seat covers I chose to check these out.The all black gives it a clean fresh look and would be easy to wash or replace. Taking out the bench in an 8th gen civic is two clicks, as you can see in the video I also took out the panels between the back rest that folds forward and the doors, as well as the backrest bolts. It may not be necessary but I wanted to do it well the first time, and get as seamless of a look as possible. Bonus: I used one of the headrest covers to cover the armrest so that everything could match exactly.I know I said long story short but in case anyone is HOH I want them to know what\u2019s going on (in the video) as well. I\u2019m not sure if I want to give 4 or 5 stars because there are a few things I feel a little picky about but it\u2019s a universal seat cover so for value for money, and doing great months later, it was a great buy that I would purchase again. So I\u2019ll give 5.Oh! Lastly- The underside of the material is designed so that it doesN\u2019T slide all around. So if you\u2019re yanking on the straps to get the material to smooth itself out, easy way to cause rips and tears. Just TAKE your TIME and it should be fine",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Ok, so I\u2019m going to try and be as detailed as possible here and set you up for realistic expectations.I recently got a new 2019 Ram 1500 Classic, the Ignition Orange edition. I\u2019m a huge Halloween lover so the black and orange called to me. I\u2019m absolutely obsessed with it! And I wish I could baby it forever.But I\u2019m a Mama.And life happens.And so does fast food or long trips states away to visit family.So I wanted to protect my seats, but I also didn\u2019t want to spend a fortune.All the options I could find with orange/black were like 500$ or more. And I just couldn\u2019t justify that at this time. My thinking in ordering these was:\u201dIf I buy these and they suck? I can return them. If they rip, break, get stained or need replaced in a couple years? It would still be worth the savings. And it would give me the opportunity to see if I value this sort of color combo and protection enough to invest in a more expensive option. \u201cThat said, I obviously bought them. \ud83d\ude02First thing I will say... I literally bled putting these on. One still has a blood spot on it. \ud83d\ude05Meh. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fI recommend these if and only if:1. You don\u2019t mind a lot, A LOT, of finagling.2. You have a very keen eye for detail.3. To you, an hour of maneuvering and a couple blood drops from hitting your hands on things under and around seats and tying straps and tucking is worth the savings in money to you.Now, if you fit those requirements: keep reading.Straight to it? These are cheap, thin and you will work your shiny, hiney off getting them on. If you just try and throw them on real quick, they will look like trash. Period. It\u2019s unavoidable.Side note: For my model truck, I have a bench seat in front with a lift up console area that exposes the middle of the seat. This set does not have a cover for that center area but I didn\u2019t mind because I have the console down covering that area a lot and I was mainly worried about protecting the back seat from spills.Back to it...you will have to pinch fabric and pull down, pinch and pull down, repeatedly, and tuck things and pull straps and tighten and tie things in unorthodox ways. (Also a tie down strap may break off. One of mine did.)In my pictures, I actually should get back in and work more on the back seat where the zipper is because it\u2019s puckered a bit how I have it at the moment. Also, I used a full size head rest cover \u2014haphazardly tucked and squished\u2014 on the tiny head rest in the middle of the back seat. It could use some pinning still, but my hand was bleeding from knocking it on things multiple times, tucking down in between the seats/tying things down under and I just said \u201cthat\u2019ll do pig\u201d. \ud83d\ude02All of that said, once done, these look bad booty Judy. I mean REAL bad mamma jamma, if you know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019. Especially from outside looking in or walking through a parking lot, it looks like I paid a crap ton for custom seat covers and I\u2019ve gotten a lot of compliments. I legit blew my husbands mind, he thought I was nuts and now he\u2019s itching for me to install some in our Challenger.So, bottom line: If you\u2019re up for a ride, some hard work, and have band aids on hand? Get em. Rock em. Join me in Pumpkin land. \ud83c\udf83 Or whatever land you happen to reside in, not sure if this review will show on other color options. \ud83d\udc4cIn closing, I hope this was informational and helpful! If so, drop a helpful vote under my review. Let\u2019s me know I\u2019m doing something right. Oh and I bought these with my own money, received no discount or compensation of any kind. I\u2019m just a frugal lady who thought I\u2019d give them a shot! Thanks for reading!",

                "reviewText": "Was so exited to get new seat covers for my 2009 Subaru Forester. My golden retriever makes a mess constantly so I thought this set of seat covers was going to be exactly what I needed. The first item I put on was the steering wheel cover. I have never used one so once again I was exited to upgrade. As soon as I unwrapped the covers they all had the worst toxic chemical intense smell to them. I reluctantly decided to put the covers on my car because I needed them big time and ASAP. I put the two front seat covers on and the steering wheel and couldn\u2019t handle the toxic odor. It literally made me and my twin brother ill. We both noticed from touching the seat covers and installing them that the god awful smell wouldn\u2019t wash of our hands. I\u2019m dead serious. Both of us smelled like the disgusting odor. I thought I\u2019d try one more time so the next day me and my brother got in my car and we drove less than a mile and the smell was so bad of chemicals, I pulled over and we ripped all the covers and threw them in a dumpster. If you or anyone who rides in you\u2019re car with you has lung issues or gets headaches easy (which I have neither of those issues) I highly recommend not purchasing this set of covers. I literally got the worst headache I\u2019ve ever had and I\u2019m 42 years old. Normally I don\u2019t write reviews, but this I couldn\u2019t pass up cause of how disappointed, and that\u2019s an understatement of these poor quality toxic cheaply made seat cover set. I wish I could get my money back, but me and my brother couldn\u2019t handle another second with those smelly chemical Oder. If others either don\u2019t smell what we did, then there lucky, but there\u2019s no way they couldn\u2019t if they got what I paid for. The customers who are enjoying them and satisfied you must had got a good batch or have bad sinuses. I wish I was in the smallest bit satisfied but I\u2019ve never been more dissatisfied in purchasing a product. Save you\u2019re lungs and money and buy some car seat covers that are better quality. These are not durable covers regardless of the chemical odor. I still don\u2019t have seat covers but I\u2019d rather breath than worry about dog hair and dirt. Plus I didn\u2019t even want my dog lying on the backseat cover, so she wouldn\u2019t smell like them. I wouldn\u2019t even give a star for this poor quality item. Get nose plugs if you order the set I did. Stay safe and healthy.",

I didnt nick my knuckles as much as i thought i would but definitely can see how that would happen. Lots of maneuvers. If you take the time to really pin everything down and tuck things away then these seat covers look custom. I havent installed the back seat ones totally yet. Front ones are 80% done. Theres still some areas id like to go back and do again. Pretty confident it will be awesome when its done. The fabric is thin but surprisingly durable. There were times pulling on it i thought it would rip. But it didnt. I also cut areas for a better fit, like around the backseat buckles and it didnt rip further. It was surprising. Still fabric is quite thin. But i do like them. I am happy with it.",

And for the X1, that would take half a day. I am yet to get that done!! I would not recommend this for a 2017 BMW X1. However, the quality, colour combination etc matches perfectly well with the car interiors.",
