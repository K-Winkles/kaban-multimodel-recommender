                "reviewText": "I choose this booster for my 5 yr old child primarily based on it's safety. Cybex is a German manufacturer, and this seat has publicly available independent crash test data (via the German group ADAC), where it scored very well in their crash tests, in particular in their side-impact crash tests (which US manufacturers are not required to perform). So 5 out of 5 stars for safety and 5 out of 5 for comfort, nice red color which my kid loves, and simple, easy installation. But the Solution B2-fix is almost double the price of the Solution B base model, despite the only differences being the B2-fix has LATCH arms rather than LATCH tethers (making switching between cars a bit faster) and the reclinable headrest. Much was made in the marketing of this headrest and I'm disappointed that it's very basic and certainly will do little to help my child sleep on long car journeys. So BUY THE BASE MODEL, and save yourself $$ while not sacrificing on safety!",

The car seat is easy to install and fits easily in our Chrysler Pacifica (we had to remove the headrest of our StowNgo seat to install the Cybex securely. The procedure was awful and I had to find a video instruction to make things work, but that\u2019s an issue with Chrysler). We do not hear those annoying rattling sounds described by other costumers when the seat is empty.Overall I completely recommend this seat.",
