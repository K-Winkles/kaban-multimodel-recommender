                "reviewText": "I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this car seat. It ticks off all the right boxes, making it a great choice for parents and caregivers alike.Firstly, installation was a breeze. The design and features allowed for easy and quick setup in any car. Moving it between vehicles was a hassle-free task, as it wasn't overly heavy or cumbersome.The comfort level of this car seat is remarkable. The ample padding provides a cozy and snug environment for the child, making long journeys much more enjoyable for them.Safety is a top priority, and I was pleased to find that this car seat excelled in securing the child properly. It offered the peace of mind I needed when driving, knowing that my little one was well-protected.One aspect that particularly impressed me was the price. While I usually lean towards more premium brands for my child, this Graco car seat proved to be a worthy contender. It delivers exceptional quality at a reasonable price point, making it an excellent value for the money.Honestly, I never thought I'd consider a Graco car seat, but this one changed my perception entirely. The brand has done an outstanding job with this product, and I can confidently recommend it to others. If you're on the lookout for a reliable, easy-to-use, and well-priced car seat, look no further!",

                "reviewText": "After reading through all the options for forward-facing car seats that would grow with our toddler we selected the Graco Nautilus.We first purchased the new \"2.0\" model but the material was really thin and my kiddo found it uncomfortable during our first road trip with it. We returned it and bought this one instead. It has a lot more material, so we're hoping it's more comfy for longer rides. I like that it gets wider as it adjusts for a taller kid, unlike the 2.0 that stays slim.Only negative is that it came missing the latch belt. Thankfully it's not required to install. We just had to use the vehicle's seatbelt instead, which is recommended for kiddos over 45 lbs anyway.We're much more happy with this one and my kid gets a bit more leg room than he had with the Graco 4Ever he was initially in.Edit: We've been using the car seat for about a year now and it's still great! Pretty portable and very secure. We also found the included latch belt! It is just tucked away in a secret compartment just below the Snuglock hatch. Updated stars to 5/5 now that we discovered the missing piece.",
