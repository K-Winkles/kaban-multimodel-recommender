                "reviewText": "Why would you pay 3-4 times as much for this car seat as for other booster seats, you ask? Funny, I asked myself the same thing. I scoured the reviews, ordered three other highly rated seats, and tried them out for myself.Graco Affix Graco Affix Backless Youth Booster Car Seat with Latch System, Kalia : Felt flimsy, like other Graco products I've come across, non-existent padding. My butt was numb in less than 5 minutes.Evenflo Amp Evenflo Amp Performance No Back Booster Car Seat, Red : Non-existent padding. Same numb-butt problem.Clek Ozzi Clek Ozzi Backless Booster Seat, Licorice : This one was actually okay - well-made and with a tasteful design that doesn't scream in primary colors. If it's not next to any other car seat, it's probably fine. Unfortunately, getting it in and out was ridiculously difficult when it had to be squeezed in next to two other car seats.So I went back to the Clek Olli, which I'd initially dismissed as outrageously expensive for a booster, and rationalized that if you amortize the cost over the number of years the booster will be used, it's actually not so bad. And this car seat - oh man, it's beautiful. The upholstery is high-quality, it's a breeze to install and to take out, and is much, much more plush than booster by other brands. I'd use it myself, if I didn't think my husband would mock me mercilessly. . .",

It is exactly what we needed fit back there. Perfect and compact for the pickup. Two things though: The cup-holder is a little weak. If you need something for a adult sized water bottle or the like, you will be disappointed in the cup-holder. Second the armrests are hard black plastic and thereby cold in winter, hot in the sun and not cushy/comfy at all. I will be making little pillows to fit on them so that they are a bit more comfortable.",

The one we previously had used the car seat belt but also had a loop between the legs to make sure kids don\u2019t slip through and my son was complaining that it was a little tight around his hips/thighs. This easily attaches/detached to the anchors which I love. Some users complained about the warning sign on the front and I planned on removing it when I bought it, I even bought the stuff to remove it with. However it\u2019s not bad at all! You can\u2019t really see it when it\u2019s attached. I honestly forgot to remove it and no longer plan on removing it.",

I loved the rigid latch, but do feel that it is a bit overpriced, especially if you don't get one with any special designs. It travels well - is light, has a shoulder strap and the latch release is awesome! However, this was not a good seat for long rides in an Acura MDX (the seats are too bucketed, so there wasn't enough back support) as my son complained that his back hurt from sitting in this for too long.",
