                "reviewText": "This thing weighs a TON, like literally 30 pounds or something. BUT - you could probably strap a kid into a NASCAR racer with this thing and they'd survive a crash (Note - I am joking - do not try this at home).There are multiple well designed and well thought out features for this, including rear facing capability, front facing capability, and conversion to a booster seat. It is extremely well padded, and does in fact remind me of the NASCAR HANSA systems (hence the above silly joke).The written instruction book is confusing and poorly organized. Read the warnings applicable to the child size for which you purchased this seat (that part is pretty well laid out), and then stow the instruction book in the slot in the back that they provide for it. Use the instructions on the right side of the car seat to guide you through the installation process. It's actually pretty simple if you do it that way. The book led me to have a swearing fit.This unit is well engineered and well thought out (except for the instruction manual). I anticipate that this will provide a lot of miles of comfortable, safe riding for your child.",

The super cinch installer is so easy to get the car seat secure in your vehicle. The leveling bubbles are clear and easy to read. This seat in particular was bought for 18 month old, and she is so cozy in there! As well as secure. The harness straps are easy to put on and the pull straps are all very smooth. The material of the car seat is so soft and lush as well as the beautiful lavender color! Very happy with this purchase, it'll last her until she's ready for a booster.",

It is a great car seat. Not too big, but not squishy for a child. We love that it will hopefully last through our kids\u2019 entire childhood. The first time my husband installed it, he GUSHED over how much easier it was compared to our other car seat. The light purple fabric has unfortunately snagged a bit and doesn\u2019t seem as durable as the darker color, although it could just be more noticeable. It also shows dirt easier, which is nearly impossible to avoid with a toddler. It is machine washable though so we aren't too concerned!",
