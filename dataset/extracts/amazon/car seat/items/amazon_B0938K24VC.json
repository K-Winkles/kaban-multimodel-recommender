                "reviewText": "Review of: Evenflo Symphony All-in-One Convertible Car Seat with freeflow, Sawyer Green:This is a great upgrade for our lil one. Very comfy, lots of padding, adjustable back and harness, 2 cup holders and tilts so easy.Our child had a car seat with very little padding and it did the job but this is just so much nicer. The adjustable harness is so simple, just pull the harness up for taller kids. The back of the seat has a lever lock on the back to make higher and a pull handle on the bottom front to tilt the seat back for nap time. It came assembled and all that needed done was to hook it in at 3 points (top behind headrest, and bottom hooks near seatbelts) and slide the seatbelt between the seat and cover and hook it in. Same thing with all car seats. It is a rear and forward facing seat, and includes the extra cushion for small babies. For infants I wouldn't recommend it at all because we normally went with a car seat carrier at that age.Recommended design, materials and use.Happy shopping...",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these seats for my Mazda 3 , my car only has the shoulder type belts and not a lap belt or latch system. I install them correctly. It doesn\u2019t matter if the car seat it forward facing or rear facing the seat is always lop sided extremely badly, like the case at just sits on its side because my seatbelt pulls the left side down. I\u2019ve tried installing it while sitting in it, I\u2019ve tried jamming a towel under the left side of the seat but nothing works and my poor boys are left clinging to the straps because they feel like they are going to fall out. This is the third type of carseat I\u2019ve had in my car and I\u2019ve never had this issue. The car seats are very very big and nice and soft, the cup holder sucks at holding cups, there\u2019s absolutely zero head or neck support for a sleeping baby, even rear facing the seat doesn\u2019t recline enough to keep my baby\u2019s chin from touching his neck. If I could do it over I would not purchase these seats again but I\u2019m stuck with them.",
