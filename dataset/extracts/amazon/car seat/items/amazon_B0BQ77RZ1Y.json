If you have ever had a kid have an accident or get sick in a car seat you will understand what a time saver this can be. As with anything, it's not going to guarantee that nothing gets by but it significantly reduces the damage to the seat below.It fits the seat great and I love that it even catches crumbs because you can just pull it out and shake it off easily or pop it in the washing machine. Bonus is my daughter loves that it is pink.Great product, totally worth it.",
