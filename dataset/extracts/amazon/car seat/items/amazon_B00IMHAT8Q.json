Emailed customer service twice with a promise of a return phone call within two business days. Never received one. So I finally called myself because the chest clip wasn\u2019t snapping in all the way on the car seat either. After waiting she said she would send me a chest clip but that it\u2019s only a 90 day warranty and I would have to send my receipt and pictures and wait for them to review it and yada yada. It has been longer than 90 days. But if you pay 100 bucks for a piece of damn material you would expect customer service to step up after you\u2019ve spent $400 plus on one of their car seats. I even mention that people on amazon were having th same issue & had I read it he reviews beforehand I wouldn\u2019t have purchased. We also have two Peg Perego ride ons and a highchair. After my experience with them I won\u2019t ever buy or recommend any of their products. Just because of the uncaring and basically non existent customer service. Oh & I also I was so upset annoyed with \u201cMaria\u201d that I asked for a manager to call me back and she said ok and verified my info and saodnto expect the call within a few hours. NOTHING. I THINK IM HEADED TO THE BBB",

The 2 velcro tabs behind the baby that connect the head piece with the back part of the main cover are stretched and the scratchy part of the velcro is exposed.
