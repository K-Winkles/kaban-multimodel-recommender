My grandson stays with me about twice a month and we were tired of having to move his car seat at a rest stop in bad weather- he lives 2 hours away and my son meets me half way. So I used for first time and headrest just comes right out - will not stay in place. He is 3.5 so not a real big deal but I feel it should have a way to firmly attach. Like any car seat it took a while to install and the instructions were poorly written. It comes with a cup holder on both sides so he can have his drink and snack. Nice basic seat - does not have leveling device and not sure how easy to convert for baby.",

This is helpful when your children are growing and you don\u2019t have to purchase multiple different car seats.The car seat has a simple design. It is comfortable fabric and padding. The head cushion was a little confusing to get on but just know you only pull the straps through the back fabric of the seat. The straps are not long enough to pull through the back of the car seat slates. The only other thing is that there is a stand in the back that adjusts for different angles. It is not as adjustable as other car seats I have had before. It seems to sit up more vertical than infant car seats. I will use this a little later when my son outgrow a his new born caraway which only is for up to 35 lbs.",

                "reviewText": "This car seat gets the job done, but it smells HORRIBLE. It comes with no protective plastic or anything. Just a cardboard box with the seat inside. It has the worst chemical smell. I\u2019vewashed the cushion 4 times all with vinegar and still smell the chemical smell. Idk what else to do. It stunk our entire house up for a week. It\u2019s also very loose fitting in the car to where I don\u2019t 100% trust it. The back side that sits against the passenger seat head rest seems not so sturdy when latched into the metal latches in the actual seat. It comes with a huge book of directions but they\u2019re very vague.Also the head rest is a waste and doesn\u2019t snap in. It falls out every time we take her out of the car seat. It\u2019s very annoying.I have a 9 month old and she loves all the extra room in it but I\u2019m just not so sure of the safety of it.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for the Cosco Kids\u2122 MightyFit\u2122 LX Convertible Car Seat, Canyon.Safety first for my sister's grandson, and that's one reason why she chose this car seat. Costco has a good reputation for the products that bear their name, which helped with the decision process.This car seat was impressive right of the package.Pros: The materials used feel excellent and sturdy. It can be a rear-facing or front-facing car seat. It will take up much less room than the current car seat, which will work nicely when the new baby arrives in May 2024, and two car seats are required.Cons:None at this time - I will update this review if an issue arises.",

                "reviewText": "There are a few things I really like about this car seat. First, it is pretty basic and inexpensive. As a grandma, I\u2019m not wanting a ton of bells and whistles - just something to go a few miles around town. The seat is good for that. It is also so lightweight that I can easily carry it through my garage and put in into the car with very little effort. And finally, it has a good weight and height range so I can use it for many years, both rear and front facing, with my grands.Now there are some things I don\u2019t love. The instructions are very long, but some key things need a little more description. There\u2019s not much explanation as to how to install the soft headrest. Do the tabs really just tuck into the fabric slots, or am I missing something? Also the recline stand was nearly impossible to close, I thought I was going to break it. It takes some serious force to get it closed \u2014 that felt wrong. The latch belts \u2014 the way they slide through the back of the seat \u2014 i had to kind of guess on that. I wish the instructions were very clear, but they weren\u2019t. And lastly, the fabric is a bit cheap. I can see it getting pilly relatively quickly. For light use, this seat will be fine though.",

It's easy to install and seems decently comfortable. Lighter than the heavyduty ones, which is a big plus. Goes up to toddler age so should last a while.",
