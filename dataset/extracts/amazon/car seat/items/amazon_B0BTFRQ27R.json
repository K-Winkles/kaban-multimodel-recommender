My child used to hate getting in and out of the car, always fussy and often with tears and screaming and bucking\u2026 but this carseat the first time we used it was magical, the buckles are easier and more comfortable with a nonslip shoulder, and the fact that i can put her in and rotate it to place front or back is great. Love that it grows with her too. Im never buying another carseat!",

It is a little difficult to install as far as making sure straps are tightened and everything in the right position but once you get it in it\u2019s great. Swivels easily for me and I wear nails! My son is so much more comfortable in this seat he outgrew the base & car seat latch one at 5 months so we needed to find something quick but worth our $. This is it! The tilt feature is also great especially when he\u2019s sleeping or having a bottle. If you\u2019re looking for comfort at a decent price then get this seat for your littles",

                "reviewText": "I read all the reviews before purchasing this and here is my feedback:It is NOT one handed turn. It takes both hands and depending on your cars seat shape (bucket or flat) it will be difficult to turn.Installation is the same as any car seat. Awful. Took me 50 min start to finish.Features: adjustable recline- you will lose fingers doing this so pick a recline and leave it there permanently.The base itself is super sturdy, doesn\u2019t move at all but the car seat itself after being locked into the base is VERY wobbly.Overall I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth 300+ dollars\u2026. Spend half and get the grow and go. Or spend the extra for one that has one handed turn.",
