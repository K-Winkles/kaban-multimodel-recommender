                "reviewText": "Mainly got this for travel. So my daughter is now 3 and for airplane rides I prefer she has her own seat with her own car seat in it and she is comfortable, she plays games, watches movies, takes naps and enjoys snacks- she does all the things & we have an easy flight this way!So this year I didn\u2019t want to bring one of our regular every day car seats they are heavy and since she is over 40 lbs I read she could use something else like that is just booster or high back booster (don\u2019t quote me but look it up) ANYWAYS I still prefer it have a back and the idea of a 5-point harness. Whenever I found this seat it was an IMMEDIATE PURCHASE!It IS lightweight & easy to install! It\u2019s easy to carry and buckle and she\u2019s safe, sturdy and comfortable. I\u2019m very pleased with this seat! We are using it as a 5-point harness car seat and since it worked so well we\u2019ve also now been able to install it in my mothers car for her to pick up my daughter from school to help us out and it was perfect! We will be using it for a while, for all plane travel and rental car use as well as with grandma! WIN!I definitely recommend this one especially for travel and occasional use but the fact it\u2019s convertible and grows with our babies is wonderful and we\u2019ll be using it for a long time as long as nothing damages it at any point. Great purchase and for a great price! Thank goodness!",

                "reviewText": "Before I had the car seats that transform from an infant to a toddler booster seat. If I could go back, I would not buy a carseat that transforms. 1. They're bulky, heavy, and take up and rediculous amount of room. 2. Just don't. Kids have messes, potty accidents, sickness, food etc...and they are impossible to get completely clean. We switched from a minivan to a prius- and there wasn't enough space for feet and legs. So, we looked into these carseats. The pictures attached are before and after of space- trust me- just buy the baby carseats while the babies need them, and upgrade to this booster style seat when it's time. (Me-telling myself in the past and all who will listen)These carseats are light, easy to install. They install flat onto the seat as opposed to being at an angle or a tall base and the cupholders are easy to install and remove with a single screw. As u can tell from the photos the room that was created after buying these alone is worth it. My opinion, Do it. They're affordable. Good quality. Lightweight. And space saving.",
