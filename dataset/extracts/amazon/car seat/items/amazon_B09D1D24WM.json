                "reviewText": "I purchased this booster to replace the booster that was part of a Graco 4 ever seat. This seat is much slimmer at the base allowing it to fit better in the bucket seat design of my vehicle. It is also lighter and easier for my son to get in and out of. The seatbelt is easy to navigate through the 2 arms of the booster. I have also noticed the seat doesn't slide around as much compared to the Graco. The cupholders are a bonus. They work alright, but most largest bottles won't fit.Overall, I would recommend this booster seat. It goes on sale regularly making it an easy decision if you're looking to get rid of a bulky seat or need one for a second vehicle.",

The seat belt buckle receptacle in my Subaru Outback is recessed in the seat and the boosters we had were too wide and made it very hard for my kids to buckle themselves. We switched to these and they are working great. My son loves his. My daughter said the seat felt a little lumpy and the pouch was too tight for her water bottle, but nevertheless, I think they are a good value.",
