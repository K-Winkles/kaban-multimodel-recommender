        "description": "Get the car seat that's built to grow! From your first ride together coming home from the hospital to soccer day car pools, the 3-in-1 Grow and Go Car Seat will give your child a safer and more comfortable ride. Featuring extended use at each stage, this convertible car seat is designed to last through all your firsts with your child. For newborns to growing toddlers, the Grow and Go can be used in the rear-facing position from 5-40 pounds. It includes two comfortable grow-with-baby pillows to give your new travel companion a snug fit, and they easily remove as your baby outgrows them. In forward-facing mode, the Grow and Go keeps your child protected in a harness up to 65 pounds. In both rear-facing and forward-facing mode, harness holders keep the harness in an open position. This makes it easier for you to get your child in and out of the car seat. No more fishing for the harness and clips from behind your child \u2013 they\u2019re right there when you need them. The QuickFit\u2122 Harness offers additional convenience in both of these stages by letting you adjust the height of both the headrest and harness in one easy step, making it simple to give your growing child the best fit. When your child is ready to use the vehicle seat belts, remove the harness to use the Grow and Go 3-in-1 Car Seat in belt-positioning booster mode: up to 100 pounds. The headrest still adjusts easily, letting you get the best fit for your child. As your tiny baby grows into a big kid, messes are bound to happen, but the Grow and Go car seat pad makes cleanup easy. Machine washable and dryer safe, it is also designed to come off the seat easily, with no need to remove the harness. The Grow and Go is designed to provide more comfort to parents too. It takes up less room when placed rear-facing, giving up to 7 inches more leg room for parents in the front seat.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for a back up seat for my grand babies. We have a 22 month old and a newborn. This car seat easily adapts for both kids. My sister and I take turns babysitting one or the other on any given day and we transfer this car seat easily between our cars. The kids parents each have a car seat in their cars ( Graco SlimFit and a Diono Radian\u00ae 3QX), but they are heavy and transferring them from their mom and dads cars on a daily basis was a pain. This Safety 1st seat is lightweight and easy to get in and out of the car, but still feels solid and safe when installed. Initially it was a bit of a struggle to install as we had way more play in the seat than the one and a half inches recommended for safety. After reading the instructions more thoroughly found that if we applied weight on the seat using a knee as we were buckling it, the seat became more solid as the air from the car cushions deflated and made the seat much more solid in the car. In fact there is NO wiggling at all. It feels like its cemented into the car. The 22 month old totally loves this car seat! She likes using both cup holders and finds the cushioning quite comfortable. She easily goes to sleep when she needs to and her head is supported quite nicely. Plenty of leg room for her too as she grows. The one month old hasn't been out in it yet, but the extra padding and adjustments for him are easy schmeezy. The washable/dryable feature is the best. Our girl loves blueberries and raspberries in her snack cup so you can imagine what a mess that can make. Bought it on Prime Day and spent less than half than what the Graco cost. Great purchase.",

                "reviewText": "We own an expensive Nuna as our daily car seat. We love that seat with the exception of the weight. I was dreading taking it along on our most recent trip. We did have a need for a second car seat for our other car. I thought this might be an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone. Received this next day and gave it a good once over. The fit and finish is not on the same level as the Nuna, but I didn't expect it to be. It is a very nice car seat and has many features that make it convenient such as, extended rear facing, recline adjustment, soft material, infant insert, and attached anchor strap. The weight was amazing. It made travel so much easier. I just threw it into a generic car seat backpack bag and made it through the airport with ease. We have a lot of travel coming up and I'm so happy we have this seat.We didn't have any issues getting the seat to sit level like some other reviewers had mentioned. The instruction book does state to use a rolled towel if you have this issue. I did have some difficulty getting the seat secured tightly with the anchor straps. I ended up using both anchor strap and the seat belt to ensure the seat didn't move more than 1 inch.I would recommend this car seat if you travel a lot and are in the rear facing season with your child.",

My 2.5 month old baby is happy in it and that says a lot. Its quite high for a car seat as she can actually look out of the window. Got it when there was a discount so we feel like it was a steal.",
