        "description": "Choose a toddler car seat that grows with your child from toddler to big kid age with the Britax Grow With You(TM) ClickTight(R) harness-2-booster car seat. This high back booster seat starts as a 5-point harness car seat and converts into a belt-positioning booster that works with your car's seat belt. Install with confidence, every time. With ClickTight Technology, you know it\u2019s right in 3 easy steps: open, buckle and close. Quickly adjust the 9-position harness and headrest using just one hand for the proper fit as your child grows. Once they\u2019re ready to use the seat belt, the 5-point harness tucks away, transitioning the seat to a belt-positioning booster. The color-coded belt guides help you and your child route the seat belt through the right paths for a secure fit. This forward facing car seat is made with naturally flame retardant fabric and foam that is safe to machine wash and dry. SafeCell(R) Technology in the base acts as a crumple zone to help absorb crash energy for additional protection for your growing child. This booster features armrests, 2 cup holders and harness comfort pads, so even big kids enjoy the ride.",

                "reviewText": "I can't say enough good things about this seat! I was really stressed about finding the best and safest seat to transition from the Nuna Rava that we've been using for the past 4 years. We've used Nuna seats since she was born and assumed we'd go with them for a high back booster as well. After reading reviews regarding the comfort level and checking the specs, we decided that we were not completely sold on their booster, especially at the price point. So I started researching other options. A big factor, along with the safety rating and comfort level was having fabric that wasn't treated with harmful chemicals, which is a hard find. Enter this gem of a car seat from Britax. First, I love that it has a 5 point harness! My child is 9 but very petite and we all were a bit nervous about using the car's shoulder belt until she got a little bigger. The five point harness fits perfectly and \"it's so comfy I don't even feel it there!\" Score! She also loves how comfortable and roomy the seat feels and that it has 2 cup holders that her cups actually fit into. She also said that the armrest level was \"perfect\" since a lot of the other armrests were really low. This is not a lightweight seat. It weighs about 25-26 pounds. However, it is STOUT! It's got plenty of protection from side impacts and it just feels so sturdy and insulated, I know that, God forbid, if we were to be involved in an accident, she would be well protected, which is a weight off my mind. Added bonus is the install is ridiculously easy! I've never been able to install a car seat for some reason, so that task fell on the hubby. I got this baby installed in like 5 minutes and when I did a shake test to make sure the seat was secure, the car shook, but the seat did not budge, thanks to a secure fit using the car's seat belt and the back tether. There are so many other little things to love about this seat, it's hard to name them all without making this review even longer but suffice to say, I'd recommend this seat to anyone looking for an amazingly safe and comfortable seat without the nasty chemicals. Thanks for keeping my baby safe, Britax!",

                "reviewText": "You know when you\u2019ve had something nice, and then when you don\u2019t have it anymore you miss it? Yeah, that happened to me with car seats. I have sworn by Britax car seats for years and absolutely love the ClickTight. When I transitioned my son from a convertible to a harness-2-booster, I went with a seat that was about $100 cheaper. It\u2019s still a good seat, but it lacks everything I LOVE about Britax. First of all, there\u2019s the rigid steal frame. It\u2019s not a lightweight seat because of this, but it\u2019s rigid and solid! Then there\u2019s the Safe Cell technology. It\u2019s the red honeycomb looking piece in the base of the seat. It\u2019s there to compress and absorb energy. Pretty cool safety feature if you ask me. The v-shape top tether fits nicely on either side of the headrest. It is also easy to tighten and loosen. There is side impact protection with foam lining the side shell of the seat and the headrest \u201cwings\u201d. The headrest is easy to adjust with one hand with 9 height positions. It gets very tall! The ClickTight installation is amazing! I had that other seat installed with the latches and had forgotten that there is a weight limit for latch use! Since ClickTight uses the car\u2019s seat belt to install the car seat, you don\u2019t have to worry about remembering that very important safety detail. It\u2019s also sooooo much easier than LATCH installation, and the car seat doesn\u2019t budge! You know the struggle I\u2019m talking about when using LATCH installation. You have to put your body weight in the seat while trying to tighten the tether and the dern seat still moves although it\u2019s probably within the allowed 1inch of movement. The Britax ClickTight is such a secure and easy installation that I know it\u2019s done right which means I\u2019m confident my child is safe. The next feature that I really missed not having on that other seat that Britax has is the stay put buckle. The crotch piece on this seat stays forward so there\u2019s no digging under your child to grab hold of it in order to buckle them. This is by no means a safety feature or a have to have, but it sure is nice having it and when I didn\u2019t have it, I wished I did, so it\u2019s a nice to have feature. The hugs pads on the chest part of the harness do not bother my kids, and they actually help keep the harness from twisting, so there\u2019s another safety feature. The neck pads at the top of the harness Velcro around it, but they are attached to the back so they don\u2019t go sliding around. Another annoyance I had with the other seat is that the \u201cmale part\u201d of the buckle that slides on the hip and thigh part of the harness would always slide to the bottom of the harness so I\u2019d have to shove my hand between the seat and my child\u2019s hip to get that piece to buckle him in. The way the Britax harness is made, that piece stays up higher so again, there\u2019s no digging. It is also more comfortable for my child now that I don\u2019t have to dig. There are cup holders on both sides of the seat with another little section for holding other things. Unlike the other seat I had, the cup holders do not make the seat wider than any other part of the seat. They are not removable but they can be wiped out easily. There are two recline angles. I honestly don\u2019t see much difference between the two, so this isn\u2019t something I\u2019d rave about. My kids seem to like the arm rests. The fabric is cool and comfortable with just enough cushion. I love that the fabric can be thrown in the washer and dryer! Game changer! I haven\u2019t had to do that yet, but I love that I can. I love the color options as well.My husband was in a car accident that required us to get new car seats. We decided the new seats would go in our 2019 Suburban which has a middle bench seat. I began researching seats that I could fit 2 side by side and still be able to fold down the 1/3 seat to access the third row. Researching was impossible because all of the Suburban reviews had been done with middle captain seats. There are more narrow seats out there, but the ClickTight installation allows you to shift the car seat over so it\u2019s not centered in the seat if need be. I missed all of the features of the Britax that I went ahead and purchased two of these and crossed my fingers that they would fit as I tried installing them. They are a perfect fit! They barely touch (which is fine) and I\u2019m able to fold the 1/3 seat down without a car seat interfering. I could definitely fit 3 of these across the bench seat with no problem. What I found with one of the most narrow seats, is that the cup holder isn\u2019t very accessible and impossible to use if seats are side by side. I don\u2019t know about you, but cup holders are a must for me so it\u2019s a deal breaker.These seats will grow with my children as they go from harnessed boosters to high back boosters, so we will be using them for many many years. I know they will withhold the test of time, and my boys will be safe! Best of all, I have all the features back that I missed with that other seat! It\u2019s worth every penny because you\u2019re getting a great quality seat with wonderful conveniences. Britax definitely keeps baby and caregiver in mind!",

It\u2019s heavy, but extremely sturdy and is one of the safest seats that you can buy. I love that it isn\u2019t bulky and is extremely easy for my small 4 year old to climb into and buckle on his own. I was tired of the bulky convertible seats that we owned and plan to keep my son harnessed as long as possible without him feeling like he\u2019s in what he calls a \u201cbaby seat\u201d so this is the most logical next step to me as we can use it with the shoulder and lap belt when I feel like he\u2019s ready. Super easy and tight install. Easy clean materials and love the cup holders as they are built in and can\u2019t pop out! My son is really comfortable in it! My only complaint is that the head of the seat rattles a little, but otherwise, excellent product. I was happy to part ways with the Nuna Rava and Maxi Cosi Pria!",
