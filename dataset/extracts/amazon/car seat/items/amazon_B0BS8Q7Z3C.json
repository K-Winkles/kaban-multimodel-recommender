        "description": "The Cosco Finale DX 2-in-1 Booster Car Seat may be the last car seat you will ever need! It features extended use in both of its two modes. It starts by keeping kids securely in a 5-point safety harness all the way up to 65 pounds. In its second mode, as a belt-positioning booster, it has them covered up to 100 pounds. In both modes, the deluxe fabric gives kids a comfy ride. In both modes, the Finale DX Booster Car Seat is lightweight and easy to move from car to car which is excellent for families who are always on the go. It also easily fits 3 across in the back seat of most vehicles making it a smart choice for growing families with multiple kids in car seats at once. With kids in the car, messes happen. But thanks to the easy-to-clean car seat pad, there\u2019s no need to stress. The pad removes from the seat and is both machine washable and dryer safe, so a thorough wash is just a machine cycle away. The Finale DX 2-in-1 Booster Car Seat is proudly made by Cosco in Columbus, Indiana. Made by American families for American families.",

I think this is big enough for him to use it for another year or two. I have one in every single car I own. At this age he can ride a booster but this is the way to go. It\u2019s not as bulky as the other car seats. We had a grow with me carseat but those things are heavy and bulky. This one is super light weight and slim.

It has a wide seat so it seems like it will fit for a while when converting to booster style. The only problem with the unit is where the car's seatbelt is supposed go when it's being used as a booster is not cushioned and my kid complained about it being scratchy when trying to rest their head. The picture makes the belt holder look more recessed than it is. Definitely bring a pillow.",
