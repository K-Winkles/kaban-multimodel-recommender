                "reviewText": "UPDATE 1/16/20: After seeing more bad reviews about the safety of this car seat, I feel inclined to update. My girls are now 4 and 5 so we no longer use these, but as I had mentioned in my previous edit, I did end up purchasing another. I had NO problems installing, uninstalling, switching these car seats between vehicles, etc. The latch was tricky to release to loosen the belt, but I found if you only squeezed the very front of the release (closest to you) that it would do just the trick. Also, I NEVER had a problem getting these seats good and tight or unmoving. I always loosely hooked the latch into the seats, then I would put my knee in the seat, put my full body weight down onto it, and pull the tether. After that, I anchored behind the seat. I honestly believe these were very safe. After all, I trusted two of these to keep my girls safe. Maybe if you're used to upper-class high-end model Cadillacs of car seats, then these probably aren't for you. But for those of us on a budget who can't afford $400 car seats, these are perfect!I love this car seat. It looks great and seems comfortable enough for my soon-to-be 9 month old! She is a little chunky, and this is a perfect fit! It was very easy to install. The headrest moves up and down nicely. It is so small and compact and doesn't take up the entire back seat, especially rear facing. I am considering purchasing another one to replace my toddler's Evenflo SureRide DLX (it's huge in comparison).UPDATE 2/1/18:I have been using this car seat for nearly 10 months now. I have absolutely no complaints. It still looks great, even after washing a few times. There are no signs of wear or tear. I've seen on several other websites that people are complaining about installation. I have absolutely no trouble installing this car seat, whether it's using LATCH or just a seatbelt. I have yet to purchase another, but here I am today, looking to do so!",

Very roomy for the little one to sit in but sturdy. The straps were the biggest concern but there are very specific instructions on how to tighten them and it is easy if you follow those. You have to remove the bottom corner of the cover and pull the excess strap through that to tighten it. If you pull the strap straight out, even if you are sitting in the seat, it will not tighten.Overall the carseat was easy to adjust and install. My little loves it and it fits in both of my vehicles comfortably. Love that I can keep my little rear facing for longer in this seat as well.",
