                "reviewText": "This is such a nice car seat. I originally bought a Clek Fllo for my 6 month old but returned it the very next day, it was hard as a rock. I'm sorry but I'm just not going to make my baby sit in that for hours at a time. When my Peg seat came I knew within 5 seconds that this was a keeper. It is luxuriously soft and comfortable and so well made. It is easy to use and SO EASY to install rear facing with latch and I got a really tight install the first time.Their independent latch system is so great, it is very easy to get a tight install because each side tightens. I also LOVE that this seat allows rear facing tethering to prevent rebound.I also love that you can rear face for a long time with this seat, and it also has great leg room rear facing. The safety features are top notch with this seat and you also get the comfort and quality. It is well worth the price in my opinion. It also looks really good, it has a great design. It also has a pretty compact footprint so won't take up a lot of room. I have a minivan and have it installed in the 2nd row captain's chair and I can have the passenger seat all the way back when this seat is rear facing. It takes up less room than my infant carrier did front to back (Britax Chaperone.) Also it isn't as high up as some other convertibles so it doesn't block my vision while I'm driving. My son cried on every car trip in his infant carrier but has never cried once after switching to this seat. He can see my other kids and look out the window and he loves it. I also know because of the amazing padding and comfort that he is very comfortable in this seat. This seat is easy to tighten the harness once you get the hang of it. Also I think it's kind of hard to tell from the picture but the Atmosphere color is a dark gray with black accents. It looks really slick, I love it. My only small complaint is the same as other reviewers, the harness pads are super long so I couldn't get the harness properly snug and keep the chest clip at armpit level but Peg Perego doesn't require you to use them. And because their harness straps and nice and wide set they don't rub my baby's neck. I will save them for when he gets older. Fantastic car seat, don't hesitate to get it!",

                "reviewText": "Replaced my safety first car seat, possibly the best purchase I\u2019ve made. Solid, sturdy and safe. My son loves the comfort and no longer throws a fit when going into the car. Easy install, bigger than anticipated but will fit comfortably into a sedan, truck, or SUV. Compact cars may be an issue.MATERIALS:Leather/vinyl material on sides with a breathable material which is very soft and padded well (almost like cooling gel) in the center from border to border.STRAPS:Took less than five minutes to install, easy and secure. Two straps with clips, as well as fastening areas for the OEM seatbelt.OTHER:Looks great, I was looking for something similar to what I had growing up, but I found something so much better. I drive a 73 Chevy nova and now my son can vibe in a safe, comfortable, and badass car seat for many years to come. Hooyah.",

                "reviewText": "So far we absolutely love this seat. I had the hardest time deciding which convertible seat to buy, and did extensive research between multiple brands. To save you hours of hassle and sum it up, I landed on the Peg Perego because of:1. Fantastic safety ratings. I'm all about a bargain baby buy usually, but when it comes to a safety item, like a car seat, I want the best! The side impact protection on this seat is fabulous. Our child rides in the outboard position so this was especially important to me.2. Ease of use/cleaning: no re-thread needed to adjust the shoulder straps. Cover is removable and machine washable.3. Rear facing capacity up to 45 lbs. We can keep our daughter safe and rear facing for a long time to come!4. Comfort. The nice breathable fabric keeps our daughter comfortable even on hot summer days. I've already noticed she's no longer sweaty when I pull her out. It also sits up nice and high so she can see well out of the window.5. Installation took me just a few minutes. It was super easy, uses your cars LATCH connectors, and also has a rear tethering strap for extra protection. I still have plenty of room in the front seat and you can definitely still fit two other people in the back row.4. Look. And, to top it off, the seat just looks great! We got a light tan color that basically matches the interior of my car. It blends in like it was meant to be!So far our daughter loves her \"big girl chair\" and truly seems happy riding in it. The only downside of this seat is the high price, but again, while I'll bargain shop on other baby related items, this is one area where I was ok with spending a little more money to get top of the line safety protection.",
