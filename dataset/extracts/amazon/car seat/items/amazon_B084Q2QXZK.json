                "reviewText": "Since I purchased this for a 15 month old, I can\u2019t attest to using it for an infant with all the additional padding. But right out of the box it\u2019s a pretty weighty seat. The steel frame adds some heft to it and it FEELS structurally sound. If you\u2019ve installed a car seat before, it\u2019s pretty easy to figure out the latch system it uses; A tether up top that secures it behind the seat and a lateral belt that you snake through the appropriate holes in the bottom/back and secure the buckles with a snap to the car\u2019s latch system on either side. One thing I particularly like is the bottom belt latch strap has pull-release loops so you don\u2019t have to twist your wrists in awkward positions to release the belt by pushing the buttons. The only thing, is the seat is tall so we had to remove the headrest on our back seat so it would sit flush to the seat. It took about 15 minutes to install it forward facing.Where I took off a star was the buttons for the adjustable straps to make them tighter to secure the car seat to the seat. They\u2019re hard as hell to adjust and I had to have the hubby tighten them because I couldnt manage the leverage it takes to pull them. The button to loosen the straps just feels awkward\u2014they\u2019re hard to push in and seem to stick so it feels \u201coff\u201d. Makes you feel a little insecure about if you\u2019ve done it right and car seat installation is one thing that you don\u2019t want to make a mistake on. However, once you tighten the belts it doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019ll loosen by themselves. Tested it by giving the seat a good tug in all directions.When we were shopping for seats, I was going to go for a lower priced seat because it wouldn\u2019t be used as much in daddy\u2019s car. My hubby just suggested we buy the same Maxi-Cosi Magellan seat that I have in my 2019 Expedition because he liked the magnetic top harness buckle. But, I decided to hold off. After seeing the store model of the Diono seat, I got curious about the brand and did a little research. I\u2019m glad that I did.Daddy\u2019s car is a 400hp Ford Explorer ST with bucket backseats and no middle seat for the added protection. I liked the ALL safety features considering that it could ONLY be installed on the driver or passenger side w/airbags. The extra plastic cube thingamajig that goes on either side depending on which side you install it on feels flimsy when you attach it. But a basic understanding of physics means that anything that can help add resistance to force from a side impact is a good thing. It adds another two layers of safety, surprising as it is, considering it\u2019s basically a plastic box. Another plus is the harness buckle button is larger and EASY to press. My Maxi-Cosi\u2019s buckle is small and a complete nuisance to press with nails and a wiggling tot. The cup holder seems like an after-thought though.I figured the cost of the seat is worth it\u2014especially since it will support up to 120lbs. Plus it\u2019s in a pretty kick-ass red that complement his dad\u2019s car which is murdered out black with red brake calipers and red interior lighting.So...if you want something that\u2019s stylish and seemingly filled to the brim with safety features or you have a car where a center-seat install is impossible, this seat is the way to go. Just make sure you got an extra strong set of arms to help with the belt tightening.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this seat for my daughter-in-law, and this is what she had to say about it:I am a 34 year old mom of 3 boys aged 3, and 4 months. Before becoming a mom, I worked more than 10 years in the baby products industry, and so I am quite familiar with carseats. The Radian 3QXT is our fourth and most recent carseat. Our other carseats are from different brands, and we have been reasonably satisfied with all of them. That said, the Diono Radian 3QXT is something special indeed!Let me explain why my husband and I like the 3QXT so much: 1) This carseat is rock solid. That gives us a lot of confidence in its stability and also its capability to absorb crash forces. The steel frame just seems more sturdy than other products we considered. 2) Despite its robustness, the 3QXT is actually less bulky than other similar seats we looked at, which allows us to fit 3 across the back seat\u2014an important feature when you have 3 boys under 5 years old like us! It almost seems as though the engineers used every inch of the seat in the most efficient manner to save on space. 3) The foot attachment for rear facing installs easily and fits nicely into the seat bite of our back seat for an enhanced angle adjustment. 3) Side Impact: We are quite impressed with the side impact protection features on the QXT that we felt are superior to the competitive product we considered. The double protection fabric/foam layering for infants is very well done, and the generously deep side walls give us an added sense of security. 4) The QXT head support is the best I have seen for keeping the infant\u2019s head secure and comfortable, and it will serve my toddler well too if and when he might actually use it. 5) While my primary concerns are safety, fit and comfort, I cannot help but be impressed with the aesthetics and finishes of the QXT.I rate this seat very highly, feeling an added sense of security knowing that my son will be riding as safe as it can get with the Radian 3QXT. Again, we are pleased indeed that the seat is not a behemoth like so many others, but can still fit 3 across for 3 boys. This is the convertible seat to buy! Ps. Be sure to read the installation instructions and/or watch the video.",

                "reviewText": "I have two of these seats; one I purchased direct from the manufacturer, and the other from Amazon.They are a great seat. They are fully adjustable, solid construction, and the covers come off to machine wash. The fact that it's a narrow seat doesn't mean it's not comfortable; the seat actually expands if you have the room. It's also a 10 years from PURCHASE expiry, so it'll last quite a while.The customer service from Diono is great as well. We had a plastic piece break on the side impact device, and they promptly sent out a replacement after a couple photos were sent.The only downsides (and I don't think it's that much of a downside) are that this seat is heavy, and that's because of the steel frame construction, and the price.At about 25 lbs it's a bit awkward to carry around, but we also bought a carry bag and it works excellent.The cost is a bit high if you don't find it on sale, but if you find it at $430 CAD, its pretty decent deal for what you're getting.",

Boy was I pleasantly surprised when my 8 month old fussy car traveller passed out on our maiden voyage in his new \"big boy\" seat. I wish I'd just started with this one--since he woke up when the car stopped 90% of the the time anyway!!! I can't rave about this car seat enough... I'm not in the least bit technically inclined, and it was easy as pie (ie: a frozen one you shove in the oven and say \"look, MIL, I made this...I swear...\".) to set up. Looking forward to the next 10 years with this tank in my back seat.",
