                "reviewText": "We recently transitioned from the baby-seat to this one for my 4 year old son. He's tall, but light, and my wife was very insistent on following the weight guidance for transitioning him to a new seat. When we did transition, my son was so happy! He loves the little cup and snack holders. The seat itself seems very comfortable, and my sone thoroughly enjoys the increased movement that the chair offers.It is very easy to install, although I do have to say that the installation instructions themselves stink. It took longer to try to figure out how to install the chair than to actually install it, and now that we know the trick, it is very easy to install.It seems very secure, and has been through one minor fender-bender with good performance. Overall, I would recommend this chair as a safe and comfortable alternative for children growing out of baby seats.",
