The fabric for the seat backs could be a little longer (another inch and a half bottom to top) but what was sent worked okay.I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to order these again if I refresh another cart!",

                "reviewText": "We decided to undertake this project of recovering the seats on our Club Car Precedent that had the stock, beige seat covers. We are extremely happy with the way it turned out. We bought the set that included the standard front seat pack, plus (in our case) the back seat package that perfectly fit our MadJax 250 rear seat.They have you measure the bottom cushion in the back...and identify the kind of profile of the back of the back seat (out of 7 or 8 different profiles). What we received was PERFECT for both the front and rear seats. You can select your color combination that you would like. We contacted the seller and ordered some samples where we would know the exact colors to choose from.The quality was high and workmanship excellent.Three or four observations and/or recommendations:1) Getting the seats out when you have a rear seat installed is not particularly easy. This depends on the method the manufacturer used to mount it. It was hard for me, but very easy for a neighbor who did this same project.2) Put the vinyl cover you are working on in the clothes dryer for 5-10 minutes before you work with it. It makes it more flexible and easier to stretch.3) We bought an electric stapler - it CAN be done with a hand-operated heavy duty stapler, but this made it much easier. Amazon product https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085XYTSM9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=14) Even though you will see videos on YouTube showing a single person doing this...it's much easier with a second person - one to hold and stretch the vinyl, and one to do the stapling.",

The old seats covers were falling apart and I looked for a long time for a replacement. I was surprised that they said to leave the old covers on, but that worked out fine. As others say, it took awhile to uninstall the rear seat to measure it and put it back and then uninstall it again for the new covers. I was worried about the \"G\" I picked for the rear backrest but that worked great too. Just take your time and expect to put some staples in and pull them back out to get a good fit.",
