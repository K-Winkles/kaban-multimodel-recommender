They are a tight fit, a little hard to get one locked in place, but they work. Thank You!Being tight also means my daughter will not easily pull them out again.So nice to have cup holders again after my daughter removed the old ones and they fell behind the tire and got flattened. She was also excited to have them again in her car seat.",
