Keep children occupied with coloring, toys, snacks, electronics, etc. Constructed with food-safe materials, everything your kids need will now be within arm\u2019s reach. The removable tablet mount provides a perfect stand for children\u2019s tablets. This detachable storage compartment makes trips and even daily commutes so much easier.",
            "UPGRADED -SIMPLE INSTALLATION & UNIVERSAL FIT: It couldn\u2019t be easier! 2 steps & 5 seconds are all it takes. Simply align the base with the car seat cup holder and push it down. No tools, no hardware, no problem. NOTE: We have two base sizes available for the best fitment possible. The standard base design is only compatible with car seats that have solid cup holders from 2.75 \u2013 3.1 inches (70mm \u2013 79mm) in diameter. If your cup holder is larger than 3.1 inches, please see our large base option.",
            "DOES NOT FALL OUT OF COMPATIBLE CUP HOLDERS: The flexible, 4-ring base adapts to most car seat cup holders and grips it firmly. This means your kids won\u2019t be able to knock it out of the cup holder. It\u2019s going to remain perfectly in place while driving. Ditch the cheap, other versions that constantly come out of the cup holder and can become projectiles.",
            "CRASH TESTED: Integral\u2019s Kids Console was reviewed, and crash tested on sample car seat models by third-party SLED engineers. The product was successfully approved and met all the standards set forth by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS-213). The console did not open or detach from the cup holder upon impact. Please follow all guidelines in the included instructions while installing. If there are any issues with installation, please contact us.",

Can't wait to try what looks to be a great productProduct is ok, I had high hopes because I love the idea. A space to keep their snacks so they are not on their laps and constantly being dropped, and a tablet holder. But the tops keep falling off and now I can't find the pin to put it back together. I bought two for both my daughters and they are pricier than others but just what I was looking for. If the lid held on better and there was a way to keep to the tablet from slipping out it would be 5 stars for sure, until then it's just ok.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: Great customer service, they solved our problem and were very responsive! They've actually heard feedback about the hinge and have updated the design. They'll be releasing the updated version next month, so we are excited to get it when it comes out!The kids really loved the idea of these, mostly for holding snacks on road trips and keeping their stuff in, in the car. We have only had these a few months and both of them have lost the pin that holds the lid on to the base. We've reinstalled the pins a couple of times already, but it's nearly impossible to do and now they've gone completely missing so the containers are pretty much useless at this point. For the price point I thought surely they would be a little more durable than they are.They're also slightly loose in our booster seat cup holders, which I read on some other reviews but I was hoping would not be the case for us.If I had the option at this point I would return them, however our window to do so has closed. \ud83e\udee4",

                "reviewText": "Do you like rooting around on your car floor for crayons or candy or toys? Of course not! Kids love having things to do in the car but they're not great at keeping things neat. That's where the Kid Console comes in.Easy to fit into nearly all car seat cup holders with its innovative fin design (just push down and it is installed), this closeable case easily helps contain those items but makes it simple for your kiddo to use them when they need them. The sides of the console are high enough to keep items inside while your vehicle is moving but not too deep that things aren't able to be seen and used. And the cover has plenty of tension so it will stay open to get what you need without any problems.There's also a tablet holder for those long trips when you just need your kid to watch something and be quiet! It's adjustable so it will fit most tablets with most kid cases on them. It adjusts using a thumbscrew so kids of most ages can use it without any problems.Then, once the trip is over simply remove the tablet, put all the crayons, cars, snacks, and toys in the tray and close the cover. Nothing on the floor and no digging around for that all important green crayon!It's another win for the good folks over at Integral!",

The fit is secure and the snack holder is bigger than I envisioned! This will make my life so much easier on road trips, being able to put a few different snacks inside for them. The tablet holder feature is an added bonus!",
