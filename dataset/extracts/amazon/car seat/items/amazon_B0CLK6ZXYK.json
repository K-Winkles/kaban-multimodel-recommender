Now I have mixed feelings about this product. On the one side it\u2019s economical and quick and easy to set up. On the other hand you have to take into account that you\u2019ll have to put this away in the suitcase before getting on the plane (in order to quickly stow your items when you get to your seat). Part of the reason I wanted this was precisely for getting on and off the plane, at least down the gangway. My biggest issue is the chemical smell as soon as you open the package when it arrives, but if you air it out and spray it with febreeze it goes away.All that said, I\u2019ve still taken it with us on the two trips we\u2019ve been on since I got it and have used it every time.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this for a recent international trip with my 3 and 1 year old. I've never been one to use strollers through the airport, maybe I should, but I usually don't have the cargo space in my vehicle to also pack a stroller. Now that my 1 year old is a little too heavy to be carrying around in a baby wrap, I wanted a better solution for carrying her around the airport. Her little legs just can't keep up! I wasn't ready to splurge on one of those really expensive carryons that have the built in kids seats. I've always thought those look a little dangerous for toddlers anyways. I'm so happy I found this! It was perfect for strapping to our luggage and rolling her around the airport. I love that There are secure buckles for both attaching the seat to the luggage and latching in my toddler. Once everything was tight she felt pretty secure and looked comfortable. it was also pretty easy to squish down into my carryon when I didn't need it anymore. My only wish is that there was some sort of carrying bag you could roll it up for storage, but not a big deal. Overall highly recommend!",
