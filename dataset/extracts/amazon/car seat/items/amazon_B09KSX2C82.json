The underneath basket is extremely spacious as well! I especially loved how you can put the baby car seat on top of the toddler seat! I thought I would have a problem with the baby car seat cover as it is attached to the handle but fortunately I figured out you can always detach from the back if you need it out of the way as well. The quality is very high end too so I 10/10 recommend. Will update when baby arrives!",

                "reviewText": "I have never heard of this brand somehow (according to car seats for littles that\u2019s shocking) and I didn\u2019t expect much for quality but honestly I am so glad I bought this travel system as opposed to the one I was planning to buy. This is a graco brand apparently and they\u2019re very safe, sturdy, easy to put together, and the stroller glides so well. I love the adjustable/interchangeable parts on the stroller too. I have seen lots of people complain about the canopy on the car seat because it makes carrying it difficult but there is a hack for it. Just google this car seat and canopy or carrying hack. You basically pull the canopy toward the handle instead of away since it\u2019s attached to the handle.",

You can turn the car seat both ways , as well as the seat ! Set up was about 15-20 min MAX !!! I will say the only thing I don\u2019t like about the car seat is the canopy is not separate from the handle , it\u2019s all together ! But overall I have to say a 10 out of 10 ! Our 2nd baby is due in Aug of 2024 and I will update again after using it with the baby !!!",

                "reviewText": "Disclaimer to start----- Per the manufacturer this set is discounted on amazon because the set is an older manufacturer date. Mine was 10/2021; which means you already lost 2 years off the car seat life. I do wish this was transparent on Amazon.That said- This set is awesome. I bought as a gift and I know it is going to work great. The car seat is so lightweight and easy to adjust. The family will not need the infant seat more than a year or so, so the expiration isn't a big deal. The stroller is very versatile and light as well.",
