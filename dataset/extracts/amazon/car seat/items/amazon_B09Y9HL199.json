                "reviewText": "My son outgrew his carseat and we thought we would stick to the same brand but discovered it didn't provide side-impact protection. This Peg Perego model DOES! And it is Italian made and shows it! Clips on securely with seat belt guides to make buckling up a cinch, even for the little one who is wanting to be more independent and responsible. Great features are height adjustment, recline (slight but effective) and that you can adjust without uninstalling the booster.I use it with the back for now but it can also be used without the back as my son grows up. Cup holders on each side are ok, not as deep as I'd like but they do hold an insulated water bottle just fine. Our middle seat in the rear does interfere with the cup holder so it was very thoughtful design that the manufacturers put a cup holder on both sides. It tucks neatly into the seat when not in use and is very easy to clean.For it's style, quality of materials, durable construction, variety and ease of adjustments, comfortable ride, and of course, the side-impact protection provided, I am incredibly pleased with our Peg Perego booster. So thrilled!",

The back feels a little flimsy based on the other reviews but you need to remember this isn\u2019t a rigid car seat it\u2019s a booster seat for graduating children from a harness setup. It\u2019s the first seat with a latch system which makes me feel ten times more secure! My child loves it and the cup holders are a bonus he likes and has helped him become more independent. Thank you Peg for quality, stylish and reliable products for the last 19 years through each child! Highly highly recommend!!",

I needed a high back booster for my 7 year old but one that has plenty of padding and could keep her in the right position when she fell asleep. It has been super comfortable, easy to pop in, has a tilt option to fit into our seat better, the arm rests are nice and the pop out cup holders work well. She has fallen asleep on trips and it has never allowed her to slouch forward. I will for sure but this again when the time comes for our other kids.",

I ordered from Amazon: Britax Frontier 90, Clek Oobr Booster Car Seat, Peg Perego Viaggio HBB 120, and Britax Parkway SGL Belt-Positioning Booster Seat. Out of the 4 I like the most Peg Perego. It would be the perfect booster if has a 5 point harness. Britax Frontier 90 has a 5 point harness and it seams well padded, but is way too bulky, very heavy, and the fabric is not as nice as the Peg Perego. Clek Oobr is probably the sturdiest, heavy, but has no 5 point harness. Britax Parkway SGL is flimsy and the fabric is cheap. I'll keep the Peg Perego for now, but I'm still researching for the best booster seat.",

                "reviewText": "I had been looking for a seat for my 5yo and took a chance on this one. I put some towels underneath the seat to protect the leather, and get it to orient properly/snugly to the seat. Totally fits the bill, fits nicely in the passenger seat, it's not really \"attached\" per se to anything when the seatbelt isn't buckled, it's just a frame basically for the stock seat belt to work. Had one moment where I had to slam on the brakes, hard, with the kid in the car and it worked flawlessly. I have not been in a crash so I can't speak to its crash-worthiness, and hope never to update this review. But for anyone who's trying to take their kid out for some fun in the Cayman, fits well, looks great.",

This seat had everything that we need!Pros:-It\u2019s pink! Huge plus for my daughter, lol.-It\u2019s comfortable.-It fits three across in the back of my dodge caravan, along with a Baby Jogger City View carseat.-It has latch system clips to keep it from sliding around.-It\u2019s mid weight - heavy enough to feel sturdy and safe, but not so heavy it can\u2019t be moved from car to car.Cons:-Cup holders do not have a bottom, however we keep it closed in order to fit three car seats. My daughter can also reach the van cup holder without a problem so it wasn\u2019t a deal breaker for us.",
