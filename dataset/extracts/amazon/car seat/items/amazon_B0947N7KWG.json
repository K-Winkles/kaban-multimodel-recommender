Also note that the inner dimensions are 1.93 inches x 1.06 inches, and the material stretches a bit. No matter what, we'll still help with your order, but reviewing in advance is always best.",

If your back seat receptacle is in a recessed cavity and it has wiggle room, but there isn't enough room around the sides or it doesn't come out more than halfway from the cavity, the Buckle Booster will not work in your vehicle, we're sorry to say.

                "reviewText": "We own a limousine service and purchased a few of these as a trial to hopefully assist our seniors who might have a few challenges in securing their seatbelts. With car manufacturers now intergrating the seatbelt receptacles into the seats, it can be difficult for anyone to locate their specific receptacle, especially those that are side by side.While these are available in various colors, we selected the yellow which allows them to be easily visible against our grey interiors. They are made of a soft but sturdy neoprene-type material, and fit snugly over each individual receptable; even those that are side by side, without interferring with the adjacent connector. They are easy to disinfect and keep sanitary in between each use as they remain in place, constantly affixed to their respective seatbelt connector.Our seniors rave about how easy they are to use, as they can feel for them as they may be compromised with their sight, or range of motion in their neck, saving them the embarrassment of delays in not being able to easily locate.I can also see this of value to small ones who use a booster seat as they wish to earn, \"Big Kid\" status, as their dexterity might not yet be fully developed.These are perfect for anyone, of any age, especially thise who might struggle with their dexterity. We are now ordering units for all seatbelt receptacles in our entire fleet.",
