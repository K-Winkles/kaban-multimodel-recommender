I have owned 2 GRACO 4 in 1 car seats that are priced over $360, however, I can confidently say that this car seats measures up (if not even better) to the GRACOs in all ramifications.

                "reviewText": "I'm so happy I found this car seat! I had been looking for a couple of months but everything I liked was so expensive! Then I found this one! The price is GREAT, the seat is well made and sturdy which makes it seem very safe, I love the color (scooter), and I'm obsessed with the canopy!!! Baby is 9 months old (21 lbs) and fits perfectly in it! I love all of the little extra features that this seat offers that others don't have like the white line along the outside of the straps to make sure they are not twisted, the nonslip on the shoulder pads, and that it goes up to 100lbs! The buckle is easy to undo and everything to adjust the highth and strap length is super easy to use aswell. It is a little on the heavier side but to me heavier feels safer! I don't want a car seat that I feel like I could twist in half! It was a bit bigger then I had anticipated and it took us a second to get it installed in our vehicle but we finally had success! After, we took a drive to test it out and baby was asleep in less then 5 minutes!!! He usually would just scream in the carrier car seat, so I'd say that was the biggest 5 star rating you could have gotten lol. All in all a wonderful product, it is exactly what it says it is, and speedy delivery. I just love Babytrend products!!!!",

If not, I'd either buy a second or get a different car seat.",
