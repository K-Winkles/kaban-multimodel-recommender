Easily install and secure the seat with the one-hand front-adjust LATCH system, which keeps the seat steady for easy self-buckling and properly in place when unoccupied. Kids love cool perks like the hideaway storage compartment and comfort features like the height-adjustable head support. Parents love that it helps protect their child by raising them up to the proper height for the seat belt. Open-loop belt guides help properly position the vehicle seat belt to allow for independent self-buckling. This seat is Graco ProtectPlus Engineered\u2122 to help protect your child in frontal, rear & rollover crashes.",
