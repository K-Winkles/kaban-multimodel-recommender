        "description": "The Cosco Finale DX 2-in-1 Booster Car Seat may be the last car seat you will ever need! It features extended use in both of its two modes. It starts by keeping kids securely in a 5-point safety harness all the way up to 65 pounds. In its second mode, as a belt-positioning booster, it has them covered up to 100 pounds. In both modes, the deluxe fabric gives kids a comfy ride. In both modes, the Finale DX Booster Car Seat is lightweight and easy to move from car to car which is excellent for families who are always on the go. It also easily fits 3 across in the back seat of most vehicles making it a smart choice for growing families with multiple kids in car seats at once. With kids in the car, messes happen. But thanks to the easy-to-clean car seat pad, there's no need to stress. The pad removes from the seat and is both machine washable and dryer safe, so a thorough wash is just a machine cycle away. The Finale DX 2-in-1 Booster Car Seat is proudly made by Cosco in Columbus, Indiana. Made by American families for American families.",

I bought and shipped this to my brother's house to have in the car when he picked us up. This car seat is GREAT!! super light, easy to install. Comes equipped with the latch system for easy in and outs and is very comfortable. I brought this back with us on the airplane. Remember, solo momma with a five year old, her bag, my bag, whatever stuffies and pillow she had and this on my back through San Francisco Airport. With what I thought would be impossible, wasn't with the lightness of this cat seat (11 pounds). With that said I couldn't be happier with my purchase. It's a great seat all around!",

                "reviewText": "I'm giving this 5 stars because you're getting a great value. At less than half the cost of other brands, you get a solid seat that is easy to set up, looks good, and converts to a booster seat for older kids, so you're not buying a new seat in a few years. Where it falls down is comfort: there isn't much padding compared to other brands I've looked at. For short trips it's fine, but for longer ones your kids might not be as comfortable. The cup holder is a bit flimsy, but works. If you're after value, look no further.",

It\u2019s definitely no frills, no thick padding, one piece cover makes washing easy. The only downside to washing the cover is you have to remove the straps, would be nice if there were buttons and slits around the straps like our other car seats. But it\u2019s still fairly simple and quick to do. The seat offers a ton of room for my toddler so longer drives are more comfortable and she has room to grow, this will last a long time! Only one cup holder wish stinks but you can choose which side it goes on.",

                "reviewText": "I did a lot of research and ended up buying this for my 2.5 yo for travel. We had it in a travel car seat bag and checked it at the airline counter and then quickly and easily installed in our uber via the latch system. Not sure if it would work on the plane. We haven't tried installing with the seat belt yet, so I can't say how easy that is, but it doesn't seem complicated. It is very simple, light weight and perfect for travel. I was shocked at how light the box was when delivered! This seat is great because our daughter is small and needs a 5pt harness right now and she is in the smallest setting. This will grow with her for many years to come. We will use this as a second seat for my husbands smaller car and for travel. Great for small cars, but the padding isn't as thick and comfortable as her daily seat, but then again that seat is much heavier! Highly recommend as a backup, secondary for grandparents or for traveling with young ones. No regrets here.",

                "reviewText": "We got this primarily as a travel car seat to use on planes, and then while we are at our trip destination. It's very lightweight, which makes it easy to take along around the airport. It's forward facing only, so, make sure your child meets the height and weight requirements for this specific seat before purchasing. It has 3 different shoulder heights that you can manually lace, but it is easy to do. My reasoning for 3 stars for easy to install is because it has those metal latches that you have to push on the little flat part to get it off the latch hooks. But, that is typical for most car seats, we're just used to the kind where you pull the tab and they unlatch on our regular car seat. Overall, we're really happy with it for the purpose we bought it!",
