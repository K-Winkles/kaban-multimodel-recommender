The seats are a little too deep for the base of the seat cover to make it over the edge so the storage sleeve isn\u2019t going to be much use for us. However, I did not buy the seat cover for the small storage it provided. 10 out of 10 I am buying another 2 for my other vehicles and my sister ordered 2 for her cars as well. Pictures are from a 2018 ram mega cab. Car seat and base are Doona.",
