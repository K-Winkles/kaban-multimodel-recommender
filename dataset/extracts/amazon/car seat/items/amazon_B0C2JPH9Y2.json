It is a well worth of money for peace of mind for parents. Dona SensAlert is an extra security addition to child car seats. It automatically sends alerts to the main registered number and emergency contacts when a child is left unattended in the car. It works both with Bluetooth and cloud, so you will always receive notifications even with minimum reception. The app runs in the background and sends push notifications. Be aware that you need to agree and provide multiple permissions to the app to do its job, like access to contacts, allow push notifications allow track motion and fitness activities. In case you forget the child, the main registered number first get alerted and if not responded it sends alerts to emergency contacts. The battery lasts about 12 months and no need to constant charging.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great idea and awesome peace of mind if you have a little one. It\u2019s so easy to get distracted, especially if you are out of a normal routine, and forget that it\u2019s your day for daycare drop off. This seems like a great way to build in reminders and safeguards just in case. Hope I never run into a problem, but it\u2019s nice to have a backup just in case.That said, this seems a little touchy to the point of annoyance. The connection is unreliable which makes it a little frustrating. The physical sensor and the app are both easy to install and use, and I think they can probably work through some of the bumps, so I think it has a lot of potential. Just not quite there yet.",

                "reviewText": "I like the concept for this product and, for the most part, this product really delivers. While you may think you could never leave your kid in the car (and I certainly haven\u2019t yet), I have heard plenty of stories from parents doing just this over the years when severely sleep deprived or newly learning to juggle many things at once (groceries, stroller, other kids, etc). And even if this truly would never happen to you, this could give you extra peace of mind when letting your LO go off with grandparents or baby sitter, or another caregiver. I like that the device itself is soft and not too big, and seems to be a fairly universal fit for most car seats, and that the cover is machine washable of course. I also like that the app has escalating alerts, so you have two chances/ reminders before it sends out an alert to contact your other emergency contacts. It\u2019s also nice that one device can link to 3 different peoples apps, and each of them can add multiple emergency contacts, so hopefully there would always be someone to receive the alert in the extreme situation where it was really needed. The only thing I think could be improved is the app itself, or the connection maybe; I\u2019ve had the device unpair with my phone\u2019s Bluetooth, which is annoying. Hopefully that\u2019s just a minor glitch that can be ironed out. I have been able to reconnect it, but it\u2019s annoying and if you didn\u2019t notice, then it negates the point of the whole thing. Anyways, interesting new baby tech; glad I got a chance to give it a try. Price point seems reasonable for all that it has to offer.",

This alerts you if it detects the baby is still inside the car seat and it has Bluetooth connectivity. The only issue I see with it is that the app freezes and crashes sometimes. Honestly, these type of security systems should be standard on all car seats. I highly recommend it!",
