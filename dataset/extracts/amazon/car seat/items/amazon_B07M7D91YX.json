                "reviewText": "Thus is our second Britax convertible seat. We had a Boulevard for 8 years, no accidents, it survived wonderfully. This seat is the same design as our old one except it doesn\u2019t have the extra side impact protection. I actually prefer that, because with those sides, Boulevard was difficult to take on a plane. The Emblem is also a bit lighter, also an advantage when traveling with it. I picked specifically the old style buckles, not the new single-click ones, because those harnesses have been reported to have safety issues. Also I like that this seat is much more reasonable on the price, while at the same time, I do not see any difference in quality of materials, craftsmanship or convenience than our old Boulevard. And, it tested the best in safety ratings, outcompeting many more expensive models out.On ease of use: if it\u2019s your first carseat, it\u2019ll be a challenge no matter what until you get the hang of it. I couldn\u2019t even get the seat buckles right when we took our baby from the hospital the first time - a nurse had to help me\u2026 Read the manual, watch a video, and once you get the hang if it, installation is 10-15 mins, pretty straightforward and pain free.The buckles and height adjustment is very convenient. I have washed the covers and buckles on this seat multiple times (the buckles ARE removable and washable.) - On Hand wash/gentle cycle. Everything looks like new after you wash it. It\u2019s a long and complicated process to take all the covers off, but that\u2019s because they are made to be super comfortable, well attached, and safe. Once you\u2019ve done it a few times though, it\u2019s not too bad. But I love that EVERY part, cover, and crevice can be reached and wiped, getting the seat to like new.Very happy with this seat, highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "When I first became a mom and was on the hunt for the right car seat I went to a nearby store to put my hands on some options. The Britax Emblem has much higher quality clips and rubber slides + the cushions for the harness portion than the others that were available. To me these would help relieve pressure points your child experiences in the event that they are in an accident because the nice width creates more surface area. I love the steel frame and crumble zone. These points alone were sellers for me, but I also think that the fabric and side impact portion of these car seats are great. I appreciate the work that went into making these! I also appreciate the Britax made videos on Youtube that help you see proper installation. I was super nervous at first that I'd get something wrong. Installation however is very easy with these. I always have a little more trouble with all car seats getting them just right in the rear facing mode, but this one is thankfully not a hard install so just unbuckle and tilt to your correct position. I don't really use the latch system because the seat belts have always been easier for me and my vehicles. Between having another child on the way and multiple vehicles that need car seats I now own a small fortune worth in these lol. But they are worth the added safety I think they provide. Thank you Britax!",

                "reviewText": "As someone who really wanted to avoid the chemical flame retardants common in car seats (which from I believe even many fire professionals have disavowed), I am so please to say that the foam and certain fabrics available from Britax have allowed me to do this.AND I didn't have to pay an astronomical premium to get this. There was a great sale for car seats during September which is apparently Child Passenger Safety Month...Furthermore, the safety ratings I found on the Emblem were really good. So win-win-win for my shopping list.Upon receiving the car seat, I found it easy to install, not overly heavy (although like many convertible seats I would not want to move it from one car to another regularly), and my child seems very comfortable in it. We would get another without hesitation at this point.Only \"negatives\":- It only has 3 reclining positions which could be a deal breaker for some, but has posed no issues for us.- The strap to tighten and loosen the buckle when getting the child in and out of the car seat is not as accessible and is a little stiffer than the Graco we are replacing. This is a little inconvenient, but I prefer the safety features of this car seat so much that I don't care. EDIT: I figured out one the straps was twisted and once I straighten it out, this issue vanished!- No cupholder. We don't use this feature anyway so again no issue for us.EDIT: One actual negative for us. This fabric does seem to pill and I haven't even washed it...really a bummer, but with all the pros, I would still buy",

We opted to transition him out of his infant seat and we know Britax has a great safety history, so we purchased this seat. We do not have any regrets. My son fits in it perfectly, it is a quality material, and the install was easier than the Graco Extend2Fit we purchased for our other car. My son doesn\u2019t seem upset with the recline position and his head doesn\u2019t bob around either. I wish we would have purchased two of these and skipped the Graco.",
