No extra safety and when they fall asleep nowhere to put their little heads. It just bobs around, would definitely suggest getting a seatbelt or headrest extender for that. The cup holder doesn\u2019t stay in place, but can easily move to both sides. Very light and can move in and out of the car easily.",
