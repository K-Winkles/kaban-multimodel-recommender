It is comfortable for your child and convenient for you as it transitions from a rear-facing harness (4-40 lbs) to forward-facing harness (22-65 lbs) to high back belt-positioning booster (40-100 lbs) to backless belt-positioning booster (40-120 lbs). The Simply Safe Adjust Harness System and 10-position headrest lets you adjust the harness and headrest together with no rethreading. The 6-position recline keeps your child comfortable, while the In Right Latch system makes installation easy. It's the only car seat you'll ever need Pack and Play.Recommended use:Children are safer riding rear-facing and should ride rear-facing as long as possible, until they reach the maximum rear-facing height or weight rating for their car seat. Then children should ride forward-facing, using the built-in harness system for as long as possible until they reach the maximum forward-facing weight or height for their car seat. At that point, children should ride in a belt-positioning booster seat. A booster is no longer needed once the vehicle seat belt fits properly, typically when they reach 4 feet 9 inches tall and are between ages 8-12. Be sure to check your local and state laws, as well as AAP and NHTSA recommendations, for car seat usage.Plush head and body inserts keep your child comfortable.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. We recently purchased the Graco All-in-One car seat, and it's been a game-changer. The installation is super easy and takes less than 2 minutes. Shipping came the next day for us and was handled well. Before installing it rear-facing, adjusting the levels for optimal comfort was straightforward. The transition from the infant seat to this convertible one happened later than we expected, but the versatility and safety features make it well worth the wait. Our 2 year old son fits so comfortably in his seat he loves it. The Graco All-in-One offers peace of mind and comfort for both infants and toddlers, making it an excellent investment in your child's safety. Don\u2019t forget to read the manual, which was super helpful.",

Pet hair does seem to stick to it, but we have so many animals, it\u2019s always on our clothes - so I\u2019m not surprised. It will probably come off pretty easily with a lint roller, I just haven\u2019t tried yet. The cup holders are detachable and really easy to pop out, so my toddler plays them if I try to leave them installed. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough of a problem to dock a star off, though.",
