        "description": "The Evenflo Pivot Modular Travel System is the multipurpose travel stroller you\u2019ve been looking for. This exceptional carriage, stroller, and car seat combo is a durable travel system that includes the SafeMax Rear-Facing Infant Car Seat and SafeZone Base. The modular frame can be configured with up to 6 modes of use allowing your child to be parent-facing or forward-facing. While the stroller can easily convert to carriage mode, toddler mode, or a frame stroller with infant car seat. The toddler seat has a maximum weight of 50 lb, with height recommendations of up to 38 inch (96 cm), while the car seat has a maximum weight of 35 lb. and up to 32 inch. The SafeMax Rear-Facing Infant Car Seat is not only comfortable with a removable body pillow, it has been rollover and side-impact tested. It features an anti-rebound bar that limits the amount of rebound movement experienced in a frontal impact. Our integrated belt lock-off system provides peace of mind that the base has been securely and correctly installed. The Evenflo SafeMax car seat has been designed and tested for structural integrity at energy levels nearly two times the federal crash test standard. We\u2019ve also tested this system to simulate a side-impact event and rollover event. Plus, it includes a stay-in-car base that allows for a quick and safe infant car seat connection from stroller to car and vice-versa. The feature-rich stroller includes cruiser tires to make it easy to navigate over multiple surfaces, a large canopy with a peek-a-boo window, an over-sized storage basket, removable arm bar with cup holder and snack tray, and convenient self-standing fold. For 100 years, Evenflo has been a trusted source of precision-manufactured, high-quality child-safety equipment engineered for real-life situations. Additionally, all Evenflo car seats and strollers include ParentLink customer-service perks, like real-time chat and free live video installation support.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Stroller!",
                "reviewText": "This is my very first stroller that I bought for my baby boy which will be here in September. I bought it despite all the negative reviews, because I fell in love with it! I received it in two days, and the first thing I did was open it. My brother took everything out, but I assembled everything. I'm 7 months pregnant, and it was very easy to put together and especially very light-weight. Should I emphasize, it was very very easy to put together and the instructions were very clear and straightforward with images. I was almost going to buy the navy blue, but I read in one of the reviews that it didn't include a cover for the bassinet so I decided to go with the casual grey not knowing if it had it or not. That was the best thing that I did, because it did come with a cover! I tried it out of course without a baby on it, but the wheels seem to work fine (I will update later when I have my baby about wheel function). The wheels are plastic and rubber, so they will function better at hard floors and cement, but that doesn't bother me because I will buy a jogger when my baby outgrows this stroller (which is when he reaches 50 lbs). The base when folded stays put on the ground, which makes the transition between car seat and bassinet very practical. The car seat base seems to have all the safety features needed, and the car seat looks very comfortable for the baby. I also love that the car seat has a canopy to protect the baby from the sun. Overall I am very happy with the stroller and can't wait to use it. It's practical, lightweight, and very cute. I will update this review once I have my baby, but for now the stroller is a five-star!***Update***I've used this stroller now for 9 months now. The wheels occasionally squeak because, like I said, they are plastic and rubber. A little bit of oil and they are good to go. It's also kind of hard to use it on the grass, as you probably need bigger wheels for that. This I consider the only bad thing about the stroller.Here comes the important stuff that I've learned after becoming a mom. The car seat has good rear facing capacity. What does this mean? That your child can rear face for a very long time in it (which is more than 500% times safer). My son is 9 months and still has a good 2 more inches of being in the car seat (he's in the 98th % for height). It is also very light-weight so it's not incredibly heavy on my back especially with my big baby. I love that I can also protect him from the cold weather in this one as opposed to a convertible. The harness is very easy to tighten (pinch test), as opposed to my husband's Graco Snug. I would like for it to have an arrow on both sides for when using it without a base (for proper incline), but that's something I could live with.Now let's talk about the bassinet. OMG! I love the bassinet, especially with all the deaths from positional asfixia, a bassinet gives me such peace of mind. When I use it with my child sitting down and he falls asleep, I just quickly turn the bassinet into a little \"bed\" and my child doesn't need to have his head hanging, he can just sleep completely flat. I would never in a million years buy a regular stroller without this feature. The bassinet's canopy is huge, which I also love. The bassinet cover is also very useful when it's cold.The stroller has a good size basket for your belongings. Everything is lightweight and very easy to maneuver.The only con I do have to warn you with is that 9 months later, and I still can't manage to become a pro at clicking in the car seat to the frame. For some reason I find it very hard, but that can just be me.Overall, this stroller is still 5 stars and I would buy it again, but maybe in a lighter color because there can always be a bug on it and with the dark colors they're harder to see.Hope this review helps!",

                "reviewText": "This is such the perfect stroller. It comes with the carseat, carseat base, the stroller and even a bassinet to attach to the stroller. The color is super pretty and it pushes so smoothly. I love the carseat has newborn padding and I have never had any concern with my newborns safety in this carseat. The carseat base is easy to install and take out, lightweight and portable. The stroller collapses very well and fits in the trunk of a sedan. I would definitely buy this as a gift for somebody and highly recommend for others and their newborns. I\u2019ve never had an issue with this stroller.!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this system for my 4th child, and I wish I had it for all of my children. It is by far my favorite stroller I\u2019ve ever used. It feels luxurious, but for a reasonable price. I bought this over a year ago, so I\u2019ve been using it a long time and I\u2019m still very pleased. I\u2019ve gotten many comments from people saying they loved my stroller and where did I get it. I\u2019m also very happy with the car seat. It washes up well and the padding is still nice and full. My only complaint would be that I sometimes I have a hard time snapping the car seat onto the stroller, because if you don\u2019t line it up just right it kind of gets jammed. I don\u2019t have a problem putting the stroller attachment on, just the car seat. Even with that slight issue I would buy it again. Absolutely love it! Also, my husband is 6ft tall and I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d and this stroller is the perfect height where we don\u2019t feel like we have to slightly bend over to push it.",

                "reviewText": "I truly love this stroller, the bassinet feature is super handy and allows my baby to sleep comfortably. The car seat is easy to work with, the basket underneath could use a little more coverage in the front so things don\u2019t accidentally fall out but it\u2019s manageable. As many people have said in previous reviews the wheels do squeak after some use, in my case it was 2 months after initial use, I contacted customer service and their suggestion for how to fix the issue was to take the wheels off and lubricate them and the hinges with vegetable oil base lubricants or natural lubricants. Customer service said that vegetable oil cooking spray would work but to NOT use WD40 since it has not been tested for safety. Personally I put Vaseline on mine last night, I strolled around the house and it seems to have worked but when I go out later I will know more and update this post if needed. Overall is a pretty good stroller, not really convenient if you travel by mass transit a lot specially alone since it is bulky but if you use a baby carrier you can easily close the stroller to get on the bus(I live in NYC) but not necessary to close it when getting on the subway. It would be great if this came with a rain cover but not a deal breaker. All in all I truly like this stroller and so does my daughter and if the lubrication of the wheels gets rid of the squeaking I will be a very happy camper",
