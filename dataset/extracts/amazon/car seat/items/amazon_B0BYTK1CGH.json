                "reviewText": "Very very good bang for the buck, included lots of features. The seat bottom and high back has all edges molded round so it doesn't dig into my leather seats. the seat bottom also has 2 large grip pads so it doesn't move around when used as single booster bottom. Seat back has harness belt retainers so you can store the harness in the open position so it's easier for the kid to find and grab when he jumps in next. Harness comes with shoulder pads and the pads also have grip material so the pads stay at the height where you last positioned it, no need to adjust every time you buckle the kid in. Overall much lighter weight than my other two 1-piece car seats, so i will use this one for travelling from now on. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "Kind of a pain to put together, just connecting the bottom piece to the top piece... After I shoved as hard as I could for a while, I brought the back rest up like it says, and there was no snap or click or anything that would indicate it was connected properly.. We bought two of these, and I had my husband do the next one just to be sure... and still no click or snap, but his felt more sturdy, so we detached the first one that I did, and it didn't just slide right out like I kinda worried it would, it was in pretty tight.. But after he connected it back up, it also seemed like it was more sturdy than when I did it.... That was the main reason for me taking one \u2606 because even if I'm just a weakling, (which really I'm not) I shoved with all my might and it didn't feel right... and I know there are plenty of moms who may be putting this thing together on their own... And really, I just think it shouldn't take such force to get it to feel securely put together... And though once both installed, it appears they'll both work well, the back rest part felt a bit loose and or like jiggly in relation with the bottom. I may be considered a little protective, and this is our first time using this type of booster slash car seat 3 in 1 deal... so it could just be the way they're supposed to feel, since they are technically two seats in one and my over protectiveness plus the wobbliness.... So I took a half star for the pain in my *** it was getting it secured together, and a half star for not really meeting my expectation in the overall feel of how safe I wanted, once I was knew it was secured down as tight as it could. I try and be detailed in my reviews because a lot of the time for me, reviews are like 50% or more of the influencing factor and determination in my ultimate decision for whether or not I end up buying something. And I can't just go around giving everything a 5 star review, because that takes from the value of the 5 stars that I give... My overall experience is this is a good car seat that seems like it will last a little while, keep my little ones safe during that time and we didn't have to spend $300-$400 on them like some of the others I saw out there..Those fancy futuristic seats with all the bells and whistles just make the more simple guys look bad, and the likelihood of them protecting a child better in an accident than the others is not higher just because there's additional cup holders or fluff.. Not literal fluff, but figurative fluff.",

                "reviewText": "This booster seat is the best to get rid of the chunky car seat in the back seat, if your child is ready. My daughter is old enough and big enough to be in a booster seat but I'm not quite ready to let go of the reins just yet so I wanted to get something that still had a back and a 5 point harness but wasn't as bulky. I also didn't want to buy something that I was going to replace in 8 months or whenever I decide to move her to a backless booster. This is perfect! It is lightweight, easy to assemble and has 3 options! 1. A high back booster with a 5 point harness. 2. I high back booster for a seatbelt. and 3. A no back booster for a seat belt. I LOVE that I will not have to purchase another car seat/booster seat again. This will grow with my daughter until she can sit in the car with out a booster seat at all. She was so excited after we put it in the SUV and said \"Mom, there is so much room back here!\" YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR LIFE.",
