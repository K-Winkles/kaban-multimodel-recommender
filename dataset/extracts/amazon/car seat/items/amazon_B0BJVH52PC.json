Which, BTW, is being transferred to the younger one since I bought this to my 5 year old. The first thing she said when she sat on this booster was \"Uh, so comfy\" and the problem was to remove her off the seat once we got to our destination. It was extremely easy to install and to have the seatbelt in place when we're ready to go. I highly recommend this brand and product.",
