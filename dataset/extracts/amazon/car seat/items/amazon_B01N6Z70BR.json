The booster safely connects with a clip in system so that there is no slipping and sliding. Also, a huge bonus is that the boosters look very cool which I cant say about anything else out there that I have looked at.",

                "reviewText": "I am one of those crazy safety moms that kept her kid in a carseat then high back booster for as long as I could. Too many people transition their kids out of these safety measures too soon. Regardless of how old your child is, maintaining car seat safety is essential and depends on your child's height and weight, in my opinion. When the high back booster became too uncomfortable for my 58 lb 4'8\" 10yo I began contemplating the no back booster, unfortunately all the no back boosters I looked at slid around the back seat and while they would have lifted my child so that she could appropriately use the in car seat belt, it was actually less safe in keeping her in place. Then I found the Peg Perago Viaggio Shuttle.The major difference between the Peg Perago Viaggio Shuttle and all other no-back boosters are the integrated rigid latch system. These are the two metal arms that anchor the booster to your car. NO OTHER NO BACK BOOSTER HAS THIS. I bought this booster for this reason alone and I was not disappointed. No more sliding around and I have the piece of mind in knowing that my kid is safe in the event of a car accident.As for comfort, my older kid was happy not to have to be restricted to her 90 degree high back booster, so plus there. Unfortunately the seat leaves much to be desired in the way of padding, she says. This wasn't enough to deter me from buying this and we will just have her sit on a towel for long drives.I feel like the price is definitely more than comparable boosters but you pay for what you get.I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to others looking for a booster.",

The only complaint I have is the swiveling cup holder. I had to clean up water and juice spillage because of this swivel cup. It's so annoying. She doesn't use the cup holder anymore for drinks so it's OK.",
