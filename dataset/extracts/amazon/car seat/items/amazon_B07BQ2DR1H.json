                "reviewText": "These were well made and offer lots of extra storage space. I was excited to use them. However, the biggest reason for the purchase was for portable DVD players. The main pocket is clear but once we put the player inside, it sagged so the screen wasn\u2019t facing forward. It was also lower than expected.Although it didn\u2019t work for us, I still think it\u2019s a good option for young kids and tablets- as long as they\u2019re not too heavy. (We ended up returning them)",

We have a 2021 Ford Explorer and it\u2019s virtually impossible to install these correctly. The top strap that goes around the headrest is only Velcro so not very sturdy. The middle strap that is suppose to go round the seat and be tucked neatly in the the crease of the seat and the back rest, is too high up and won\u2019t go that low, besides the fact that the strap isn\u2019t long enough to reach. There\u2019s two hooks on the bottom to attach but there\u2019s no where in my vehicle to hook them. I don\u2019t know what vehicle these were made for but it definitely wasn\u2019t a Ford Explorer.",
