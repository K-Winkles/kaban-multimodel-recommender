It\u2019s so plush and comfy for my kiddo and the dark color hides a lot.The newer features of the raised seat belts and easy clip on centerpiece is worth the extra $$.We have the older model as well and this one is just so much nicer with those small features. I feel like my little one is very safe in it.",

                "reviewText": "We had just bought a suburban and also have an explorer. Wanted a new seat for the new car so I chose this one. I am getting used to being able to unbuckle to magnetic chest clip with one hand still. It is a nice feature though. I love that my sons head doesnt fall straight down like it does in the other seat we have. I love having 2 cup holders. All in all I am very happy with this car seat and the price we paid for it. The only issue I have (and I have this with ALL seats these days) is that due to the bulk if the seat, it makes the passenger seat almost unusable. Even in a Suburban. I was hoping this would get better because it is absolutely horrible in the Explorer. It is somewhat better in this seat, but if there is someone in passenger seat, my son wont have much room to move his legs.....",

It is a little hard to install by myself in my Traverse, I like to have the seat belt as tight as possible. It is a bulky car seat for rear facing, but the comfort my toddler gets from it is worth it. He used to hate car rides, now he looks out the window or sleeps.",

                "reviewText": "After four months, my son is about 16.5 lbs and his infant car seat was getting a little small. We still use them but I wanted something permanent in my car. This wasn\u2019t the easiest to install, as I couldn\u2019t tighten the belt as I wanted to. Since it\u2019s such a big and bulky car seat, the front seat has to sit up really far when the pria 85 is fully reclined. I have a 2017 highlander.As far as comfort, my son has seemed to completely enjoy his car rides now. He\u2019s up higher and has more room. Overall, this is a great car seat if your car is big enough for it and you have help installing it.",

Make sure you are purchasing with Amazon as the seller. AlbeeBaby will make you responsible for the shipping costs of returning. This did not seem like that big of a deal until those costs were almost as much as the car seat.",
