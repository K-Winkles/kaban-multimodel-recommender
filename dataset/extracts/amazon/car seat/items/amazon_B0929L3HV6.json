                "reviewText": "This booster is not only nice to look at but it's comfortable. The seat doesn't have as much padding on the bootie as our old seat but he doesn't mind. The fixsafe latch system was a bit hard to get to pop out at first , I had to really push the button extremely hard to get them to come out. But then the install was a breeze. So easy. The chair itself is quite light which makes it convenient to put in other cars if necessary, it folds completely into itself and makes for very easy travel. It could easily fit in an overhead compartment on an airplane and it comes with straps to wear it on your back as a \" back pack \". The cup holder is bigger to accommodate bigger cups and it's easy for my son to put the belt on himself. Overall I'm really happy w my choice. We are a diono family and when my old one was compromised from an accident it was a no brainer I was getting another Diono. We upgraded from a Rainier to the Monterey since my son is getting bigger and taller this seat accommodates up to 63 inches and 120 lbs. So he can be in it longer. Which was a big appealing factor in the decision.",

                "reviewText": "We are another Tesla Model 3 family frustrated when our car seat that was supposed to easily convert from a harness to a belt positioner ended up being too wide to access the seatbelt buckle in that mode. Apparently this new model of the Diono Monterey and the Diono Everett are two of a very few models of high back boosters that are narrow enough to make the buckle accessible. I went with this one because it looks cool and in case we wanted to travel with it. However, we did still have to buy a 3\u201d rigid seatbelt extender to get the buckle out from recessed so that my child can buckle it herself. My engineer husband was not as concerned about safety of using the extender as I was, but in the end an easily buckled child is safer than one where it\u2019s hard to tell if the buckle has clicked because you need an adults weight on it to make it click. I think the Everett is 0.5\u201d narrower and that may make all the difference and I probably could\u2019ve returned this to get that one. Anyway, so far so good in terms of its comfort, my almost 6 year old (46\u201d and 52 lbs) has fallen asleep in it a couple evenings already. She used to get car sick when rear facing, and we went on a 2 hour road trip this past weekend and she had no issues (I still have blue emetic bags stacked everywhere, though!). It installed fairly easily and feels rock solid due to the rigid latch. There are no arm rests but I don\u2019t think my daughter cares since the previous car seat didn\u2019t really have them. The cup holder does the job and fits her wider Contigo and stainless steel water bottles. We also got the Diono brand cubby/box for her to keep snacks, books, sunglasses, etc. because her old Chicco MyFit had a little box that attached that she got used to having it all close. So far no issues getting her to sit up straight and not fool around with the adult belt on\u2026if we had switched her to this mode a few months ago that wouldn\u2019t have been the case. Much safer in a harness as long as possible, but this one is good when your child is finally ready!",

This was purchased basef on safety reviews and like how easy it is to use. The seat is very sturdy, easy to snap in and remove, and more importantly, comfortable for my child. Perfect for traveling as it folds and can be stowed away in upper compartment of airplane.",

                "reviewText": "We chose this model for the compact fold/straps because we were planning plane travel with driving on the other end for our 5yo who is not mature enough for a bottom seat only booster for any significant distance.The fold is great and compact. The provided straps are just webbing, and There was no way we\u2019d use them for more than a minute. I found some clip on backpack straps on Amazon that were more comfortable, but it sits at an awkward angle. You\u2019re better off using some bungee cords to strap it to the handle of rolling luggage if you\u2019re going very far.We gate checked it for our flights but you may be able to put it in an overhead bin.Since the back does not detach, it\u2019s easy to quickly install and remove from an Uber. I had trouble getting the isofix latch connectors to work in one Uber (Toyota sienna, I believe) but it was a short ride so we went without them completely attached.We also like that the sides of this seat expand like the other Monterey models because my son is tall with a long and wide torso and would likely have cramped shoulders by the time he ages out of a standard booster seat. What I didn\u2019t realize until we got it is that the width expands as you raise the headrest, not independently like the other models.Overall we like it but unless you\u2019re planning some travel that includes Ubers and/or flights where you\u2019ll rent a car or ride with family/friends on the other end, save your $$. We have the $100 XT model in our other car and it functions just as well if you\u2019re installing it once and leaving it there (and it still has the expandable back panel). If your child is average height/weight/build, you can pick something even cheaper.",

                "reviewText": "We have been a family of frustrated people ever since our oldest transitioned to a highback booster because our car (Model 3) has absolutely atrocious design when it comes to accommodating car seats: the rear inboard seatbelt buckles are deeply flush/recessed and have no give. We were using a Graco Tranzitions as a high back booster before (a great seat in any other car and one of the narrower more affordable ones at that), it was still just barely too wide to buckle easily. The Monterey 5 iST is not only narrow, but it has ISOFIX. The cutaway allows for easy access to the buckle so my kid can do it himself without struggle. I am pretty sure some savvy engineers have lived through the hell of the Model 3 and designed this seat with it in mind. THANK YOU",

They are heavy which shows stability and quality. Highly recommended and easy to fit too.. fantastic. Also cup holder included too",
