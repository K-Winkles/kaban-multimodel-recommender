Also, in furthest rear facing reclined position, my son's head falls forward when sleeping (maybe all convertible carseats are this way?)",

It does not recline enough for angled back seats so be aware of that before buying. I have an Audi s4 and wife has a new Hyundai Sonata and it won\u2019t work in either one of our cars. Other than that, it\u2019s a nice seat. Just have to buy another seat before I can use this one.",
