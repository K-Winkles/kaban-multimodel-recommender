                "reviewText": "Gone are the days of wrestling bulky booster seats! The hiccapop UberBoost has been a game-changer for our family's on-the-go lifestyle. Installation is a breeze \u2013 literally just inflate and buckle! This makes it perfect for taxis, carpools, or rental cars, eliminating the need for bulky traditional seats.But the convenience doesn't stop there. The UberBoost packs away compactly, fitting effortlessly into backpacks or luggage. This makes it fantastic for travel, saving precious cargo space and eliminating rental fees. Plus, the inflatable design offers surprising comfort, keeping our child happy even on long journeys.Speaking of long journeys, life happens, and even the best inflatables are susceptible to punctures. Thankfully, hiccapop backs their product with a lifetime replacement warranty. I recently put this to the test when our UberBoost sprung a leak. The customer support team was incredibly helpful, guiding me through the simple warranty process and promptly sending a replacement.Overall, the hiccapop UberBoost is a lifesaver for families who value convenience, portability, and peace of mind. Its ease of use, travel-friendly design, and exceptional warranty make it a top choice for parents seeking a reliable and hassle-free booster seat solution. If you're looking for a car seat that can keep up with your active lifestyle, I highly recommend giving the UberBoost a try!",

                "reviewText": "Took two of these with me to travel in cabs on vacation with my twins. Due to the amount of bulk with 2 of them inflated, I had to deflate and re-inflate them often through the trip and each time it was very easily done. Deflating and folding it up to put in the pouch took maybe a minute each. Inflating is easy, under a minute each. Deflated, both fit inside one pouch which helps when you\u2019re traveling. I brought a carabiner to clip them together for occasions when I didn\u2019t deflate them and just carried them slung on my arm, but I don\u2019t recommend this method of carrying for long term. I clipped the carabiner on the loops meant for securing the shoulder clip and the cloth is starting to wear and stretch out too much from the weight of the booster. It\u2019s not meant for this purpose so I can understand why it\u2019s wearing down.Anyway, in terms of safety, I think the product works fine. Hooking and unhooking the seat belt through the metal clips takes an extra few seconds but not a big deal. Cabbies were never impatient with us when we took care of this because they\u2019re mostly just grateful we brought our own boosters for the kids. My kids are on the small side, but they\u2019re 40 lbs and the booster gave them enough height to safely ride with a seat belt on in the cab. I felt good about them sitting on them and my kids said they were very comfortable, even on an hour long ride. In even tiny Uber cars, I could fit one on the left and one on the right and I\u2019d sit in the middle between them while dad sat in the passenger seat in the front. It made vacation travel super easy. I\u2019d recommend it for travel purposes, especially for people with multiple kids. Sure beats lugging a car seat or a traditional booster.",

                "reviewText": "We now has 3 of these (gave them to grandparents as well as our car). My 9 year old is on the smaller size and just doesn't fit a full seat belt the way she should yet but is super embarrassed to sit in a \"baby\" seat (regular car seat booster). This is a great compromise. Small and easy enough to move around and switch cars, but sturdy enough to give her that little lift to get the belt to fit her right. We have been using our first one for about 3 years and it has lasted well (every few months you need to reflate a little is using it every day). No holes, tears and doesn't rapidly deflate like another brand we tried. Love that it fills with three little puffs of breath. It has little plastic hooks on either side to help it tether to the belt so it doesn't slide and both my kids say it is comfy to sit on.",

                "reviewText": "We have a few booster seats between my, spouse's, and in-laws' vehicles: Nuna, Diono, Bubble Bum, and now this one. I purchased this to keep in my car as a backup for those moments when I have an extra kiddo in the car and/or for travel. I previously purchased a Bubble Bum, which my child did not like in terms of comfort or security. She likes this booster seat, she requested we swap out her Diono Solana for this. Pros: comfortable (has a deeper and wider seat), is a bit taller than Bubble Bum so the child sits up more, easy to inflate and deflate, easy to install, the grippy bottom means it actually stays put on the seat, the metal belt feeds are secure and hold the seat belt in place, and the shoulder seat belt adjuster actually works! I don't have to unclip the shoulder seat belt adjuster when unbuckling the kiddo from the car. Cons: limited colors, I guess? It's a bit wider than the Bubble Bum, but not prohibitive for getting three kids (one in a rear-facing Nuna Rava, the other in a Diono Solana) across the back of a sedan.Overall, highly recommended as a booster seat. Child and parent approved. And by the NTSB.",
