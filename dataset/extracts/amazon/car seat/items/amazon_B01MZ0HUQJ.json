                "reviewText": "Received early and it was sitting outside. It was incredibly light to move the box inside! Once opened I was still shocked at how light it was with the base attached. The base is very nice and sturdy loooking. It has the indicator to help get the perfect angle and a few pieces that adjust to let that happen. Instructions were simple. The car seat is incredibly lightweight without feeling cheap or like it would fall apart and the fabric feels nice. It seems like it would wipe off quite easy but I\u2019m not sure yet. The handle was good quality, folds easy and is thick enough it doesn\u2019t hurt your arm. The canapoy seems nice. Thin but it would do the job. The only concern I have is with the size it\u2019s very narrow. Not sure how long a baby could fit in there. It\u2019s very long just kind of skinny!",
