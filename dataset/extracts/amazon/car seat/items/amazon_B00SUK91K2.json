My son has been \u201cembarrassed\u201d to get into a car seat outside of school but he isn\u2019t tall/old enough to go to a different type of seat yet. I have been eyeing these seats for years, but couldn\u2019t justify getting rid of our other seats to get this. The accident gave me the perfect excuse. He isn\u2019t embarrassed anymore hopping into the car. The straps do seem to be a bit frustrating bc they keep twisting, and it wasn\u2019t easy to adjust the straps. My husband and son do have a hard time buckling it and it feels loose in the car despite the straps not being able to go tighter. However, that may be an issue with the car and not the car seat. Overall, I am happy with it and my son says it\u2019s comfortable. He likes having access to two spots for drinks/snacks (even though our old one had the same thing).",

                "reviewText": "My daughter is technically old enough to be out of a car seat, all of her friends are out of a car seat, but she weighs 40lbs and will stay in one as long as possible. With that being said, she hated being in one. I let her pick out her own seat and she was so excited to find kidsembrace. She was torn between Cinderella and Tiana and went with Tiana. She was soooo excited for it to come in, came earlier than expected, and now she doesn't mind the car seat at all.Installing was easy bc I used the lap belt (I hate the seat anchors in my car) BUT the back tether strap is hard to loosen. Eventually I got it, but it was difficult. I do like that the straps are orange bc it makes them easy to find. Not very aesthetically pleasing, but it's fine lol overall I'm happy with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "My 4 year old truly truly loves this car seat. It is comfortable and already comes basically put together. It is extremely lightweight so can be moved easily.The reason I give 4 star is that he seems to easily get his arms out because he can easily pull the harness part down (the piece that sits over the chest) enabling him to slide out. I will have to wait a bit longer for him to use it, but it is seatbelt supported so I know it will go to use.If the harness had a bit better grip, this would be a 5 star review.",
