                "reviewText": "After watching a short video from Graco on how to install the car seat, it was really easy to install. I was a little intimidated at first because I did hear some reviews that they couldn\u2019t get it installed into a small car or that it did slide, but I had no issues. It was super easy, and it fits wonderful in my car. I also love how it swivels and it makes my baby so happy, and myself when getting her in and out. Baby is happy with how comfortable it is as well and has great padding. Cup holders are a plus, since my old Graco didn\u2019t have those before. Definitely an upgrade and worth the purchase since it can grow with them as they grow. Highly recommend.",

I had also accidentally hit my sons head on the car roof/door jam in my struggle to get him as he got heavier and wigglier it was just too hard to get him over the side of the seat and situated. I got this one obviously since turns facing towards you so you plop them in really easy. I don\u2019t have to fight him anymore it is soooo worth the money. The other seat he would arch and I would struggle to get his butt in the right spot. The one handed lever under the cup holder makes it super easy to unlock and swivel this seat. It also has nice padding and easy to remove if there\u2019s spill/vomit. The other thing we realized right away is that it somehow has a smaller profile leaving enough room for my husband to sit in-front of the car seat with plenty of leg room.",

                "reviewText": "This carseat is seriously genius. We've been using it for about a month now. we have a larger truck with no running boards so putting the baby in her seat was a chore every.single.time. Being able to turn the seat, put her in, buckle her, and then turn it back is such a back saver and eases the frustration of trying to wrangle a child into a seat sideways. There is so much cushioning she seriously falls asleep in it every time we go somewhere. I also want to commend the anchor system. Her carseat before this one had the original \"C\"-like clamps on them that were a pain in the butt to attach and detach. These just pop right in and have a button to release the hooks allowing them to just pull straight out. Some cars still give me troubles when hooking it in but its the vehicle not the seat.Something I do want to point out is the seat gets very hot when the child is in it. Our particular car doesn't have any ceiling vents for the back seats (she is rear-facing) and in the hotter months she was drenched in sweat when I would get her out of the seat because all of the cushioning is just so hot-- comfortable, but hot.Another thing I would like to add is that this thing is BIG and HEAVY. Now hopefully you aren't having to move it back and forth to much but Lord, if you do... overall though the benefits of the swiveling and easy use of the seat far outweigh the 2 inconveniences I have found with it.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This rotating car seat has truly been a game-changer in our family's life, and I can't help but sing its praises.First and foremost, it's not too big and clunky, which sets it apart from many other rotating car seats on the market. Its design strikes the perfect balance between functionality and space-saving. You don't feel like it's eating up extra room in your vehicle, making it ideal for smaller cars or families with multiple car seats.The standout feature of this car seat is the swift, one-handed operation to rotate it. This innovation has made loading and unloading our baby a breeze. No more awkward contortions or struggling to reach into the car \u2013 a simple, smooth turn and you're good to go. It's a real time-saver, especially for busy parents.My baby absolutely loves it too. I can see the delight on his face when putting him in it for car rides. This car seat is not only safe but also comfortable and enjoyable for him, which is a huge win.Another impressive aspect is the envy it has stirred among other moms. Every mom who has seen it can't help but express their jealousy at not having discovered it sooner. It's a testament to its uniqueness and practicality.In summary, this rotating car seat has made our life easier in so many ways. It's compact, easy to operate with one hand, and our baby adores it. It's the envy of fellow moms, and I couldn't recommend it more. It has become an essential part of our family's travel routine.",

                "reviewText": "Love the one hand rotation, cup holders, it\u2019s comfy and roomy for the baby and not to bulky in the car. So these features just outweigh the major downside as cheap fabric, not able to change the recline position when installed. I Hate the fabric (too cheap) and instructions (I\u2019m engineer and spent 15 minutes just figuring them out), hate that I cannot change recline position in rear-seating position without adjusting the latch belt (it blocks the seat ability to recline because of the how it realized in the base). Why Graco cannot do the rigid-latch and provide better fabric in their seats? They all are looking cheap and shabby after some use, also why does it have fire-retardant fabric in relatively expensive model?",
