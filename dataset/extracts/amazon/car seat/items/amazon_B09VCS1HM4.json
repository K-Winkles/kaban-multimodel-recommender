                "reviewText": "We used a Britax infant seat and stroller for years, and we were very satisfied with their safety, sturdiness, and appearance. When our now-seven-year-old was clearly tall enough and weighed enough for a booster earlier this year, we shopped around but decided to stick with Britax. She loves her purple \"big kid\" seat and reports it is very comfortable. It is easy to latch into our CRV and weighs very little compared to her behemoth infant seat.I would note, though, that one may be limited as to which back seat to place the booster in certain SUVs because it may block part of the driver's view (our daughter's seat has to be place directly behind the driver's seat to keep all sightlines clear).Great product. Highly recommend!",

So far it's the only brand I found that has this incorporated in their booster seats. The alligator snaps make it easier to secure it in the car. Highly reccommend, we ended up purchasing a second one.",

                "reviewText": "Having a booster that used the latch system was a must for us. This seat was very easy to install and sits fairly well in my husband's Lexus sedan and my Toyota Highlander. In the Highlander there is a bit more wiggle im the back but with the kiddo strapped in it is secure. Our 5 year old daughter can easily buckle and unbuckle herself. On occasion the shoulder strap gets twisted but she is figuring out how to correct it herself. I really like the lap belt holder as it keeps the lap strap in the correct place and she can do it herself. She says it's comfortable. We have yet to take it on a long trip but for around town it meets our needs.",

                "reviewText": "We purchased this after months of research. Our previous car seats were Dionos and it was difficult to imagine that any other car seat would be as safe. As we moved from a five point harness to a booster, it was a tough decision since many boosters are so flimsy and many do not have the latch feature. This booster not only had the latch but also had the durability we were looking for.So far, this car seat has held up for our 7 year old and she does not complain that it\u2019s uncomfortable on long drives.It also does not slide around in the seat and the top portion is securely attached to the bottom portion. I\u2019d say it was money well spent. I\u2019ll update later on the longevity of this purchase.",
