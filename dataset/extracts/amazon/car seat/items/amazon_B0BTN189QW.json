As a grandma I don't want to be buying new seats each time the child needs to move up a size. It is really nice for the parents when the grandparents have their own car seat. It is such a pain to move some of them and get them installed again properly in another vehicle. There were times when we forgot to move it, too, so this is a nice one for my car. Parents will find it handy, too, as it will not need to be replaced very soon. It gets expensive buying new car seats and keeping up with standards you almost feel like you should purchase a new one each time. I haven't had a child sit in it yet but it looks comfortable.",

                "reviewText": "We've been using this seat for a few months now. I wanted to give ample time to use it in order to give a decent review. The seat is very easy to install. I like that it has the harness, once my children are too big for it, we will move to the regular belt in the car, there is a guide where you can run the belt through. Once your child outgrows the back, you can easily remove it and use just the bottom booster portion.The seat functions well and is moderately comfortable, feels better than my child's old seat, she hasn't complained. The oatmeal color stains super easily and looks awful when stained. I like that it has two cup holders, but they twist on and off and come off easily. It's a pain, but I can deal with it.My biggest issue with this seat are the buckles, especially the bottom one. It is SO HARD to press! My children (5 and 6) cannot press it at all, so they need my help to unbuckle. It's a pain in the mornings at school drop off. Their old seat they could handle all by themselves. Honestly, the bottom buckle is even hard for me to press! The good thing is that you do not have to use the harness system if you don't want, so this may not be an issue for some. I however, like the added safety with the harness and will continue using it until they outgrow it.I did buy an additional seat, so I have 2 of these. I like the seats to match in my car, so after I received the first one to review, I bought an additional myself.",

The buckles are easily buckled and are just easy enough to open, but not too easy that any sibling could accidentally open them. I also appreciate that the car seat cover is machine washable, although it has very specific directions on how to dry it for 10-12 minutes on low heat. The seat cushion\u2019s color is a very dark maroon, which is unique, but still very heat absorbing. I\u2019m just glad that there is a lighter color in the middle sections where our child will mainly sit. I also like that the seat is well-cushioned and comfortable to sit in.",

                "reviewText": "I have big, expensive, heavy car seats that don't budge from the family minivan. That's the only vehicle I have that can fit all seven of us without me losing my mind. I have several SUVs, but you just can't beat sliding doors. The problem I have is my five year old likes to ask to go with me every time I go to the store or something. I don't want to always take the minivan, and I'm way too lazy to move a booster seat out of the minivan. Well, this solves that problem. I have designated this as my official mobile seat. She can either use it with the headrest up, or just with the booster seat. It's not hard to remove. If my three year old wants to go for a ride, I can just toss the whole thing in my RAV4 or whatever I'm driving. This fits in that just fine. It also fits in my wife's godawful EV6 GT fairly easily. I thought about the EV6, so that probably took it down to half charge. That car is a pain to put any car seat in, thanks to the low roof. I got this in there and only banged my head three times. It fits just fine once you get it in there. It actually probably fit in the EV6 better than it did in my Rav4 once I got it in there. The interior lights turned on in the EV6 came on though. That probably reduced its range by 30%.Build quality is decent. Is it as nice as the $500 monstrosities that my wife bought? Well, no. Those are definitely nicer. They are also heavier and more ungainly. That's why they stay in the minivan and if anyone moves them, I'll hit them with the minivan.My five year old uses a water bottle that is meant for cup holders. It fits in these. I know there are two because at some point, parents decided that kids needed snacks 24/7, but the other cupholder isn't used. I don't let anyone eat in my cars. Guess what? My minivan is spotless. I have five kids. Amazing how that is possible. You can take those cup holders out and clean them easily. Dishwasher. Pressure washer. Flamethrower. Whatever.Overall, it's good for a portable car seat, either for multiple kids, or to grow with your kid.",

It is still a nice booster seat and serves the purpose great. I bought it as an upgrade to our old car seat that my daughter has grown out of for the most part at 3 years old (taller than avg).
