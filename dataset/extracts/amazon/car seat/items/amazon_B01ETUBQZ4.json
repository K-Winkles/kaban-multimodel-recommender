Easy to clean, travel with, and secure into your vehicle. We\u2019ve only ever secured it with the seatbelt.Pros: The Onyx color is lovely, we didn\u2019t want anything too bright or flashy and the color in person matches the picture. It seems comfy, I\u2019ve obviously never used it personally, but my daughter has never seemed to have an issue. Lightweight. Pretty compact in size compared to others, we have a very small vehicle (Chevy Spark) and this fits pretty well without looking very bulky. Although, it doesn\u2019t fit in rear facing position without moving the passenger seat as far up as possible.Cons: The straps twist constantly in the bucke part. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing something wrong, but I can\u2019t seem to stop it from happening.",

                "reviewText": "Love this car seat for the most part. I have one in each of my cars. It's pretty decent for the money. It's narrow so it takes up less space in my forester, allowing two to ride in the back with the seat. It was a huge upgrade in comfort when we got it when my son was two and is nicely padded. It's pretty easy to take apart and wash, way more so than the graco infant seat I had before (and my son is a puker, so I've done that a lot) and so far it seems to wash well. It does have some drawbacks, however. The buckles are pretty stiff and a challenge to get undone at times. I've had my other one for a year and it doesn't get better with use. There is also a serious learning curve when it comes to installing it rear-facing. The first time is kind of a nightmare, once you get the belt adjusted, it gets much better. It's a challenge to even figure out how to do that however since the instructions for rear-facing seemed to me to be almost non-existent. At a certain point I thought I had made a horrible mistake and inadvertently gotten a forward-facing only seat. I think the forward facing installation was much more thought out, because it has s much easier. The weird thing with this particular color is also that it is getting weird darkish patches as I wash it. Not like stains, but like the dye is washing out. It's starting to look kind of bad. But ultimately it's a very good car seat for the money. I'm not looking to switch any time soon and I have bought two!UPDATE: I've had this seat for about a year now and my little one finally maxed out the rear facing so we flipped him forward facing. WOW. I love this car seat so much more. It is a breeze to install forward facing and fits nicely in both our Enclave and Forester seats. its secure with seat belt or anchors and is still comfortable. If you are buying for a forward facing kid, it is so much more convenient.",

                "reviewText": "We had used a rear-facing \"carrier\" type car seat from birth to two years, but we reached the point to make a change to car seat for a toddler. While this car seat can be used earlier, we found it perfect for this moment of transition. It was easy to install, softly padded, and the straps are secure and comfortable. The added cup holder was a bonus. I'd buy it again; it's a great value.",

                "reviewText": "What I like:- Easy to install in car once it\u2019s set up: I used this rear facing for my baby when she was 8-10 months old and it was very easy to install it rear facing. The trick is, I used my knee to apply pressure to the seat while I tightened the latch strap and it was very secure, did not move more than an inch side to side and did not slip backwards when baby was inside.- AffordableWhat I did not like:- The cushioning is thin, does not seem comfortable for long trips.- Straps have to be rethreaded to adjust, very inconvenient.- The headrest seems off for some reason, it was slightly crooked even though both sides were adjusted to the same height.I ended up buying a more expensive convertible Graco seat, but I would recommend this one if you are on a budget/if baby is 20+ lbs. I honestly would not feel comfortable putting a newborn in this seat, it is very lightweight and not cushioned enough.",
