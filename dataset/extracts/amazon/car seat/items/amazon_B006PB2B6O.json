                "reviewText": "I purchased this car set for my son who was 14 months at the time I purchased it. We've had it for over 6 months now and I am really happy with the purchase.What I Like:I love that this car seat was reasonable priced but still a quality product. It does exactly what I need it to without paying for a huge car seat with extras that we don't need.It has a fairly narrow design, and fits in my car with a booster seat on each side. This was a must for us as we have 3 kids in our sedan. Also, I'm petite so a big bulky car seat isn't fun to lug around or try to install.Not too bulky, but still seems soft and comfy. My son's not a huge talker, but he hasn't indicated that it's uncomfortable in any way.Easy to install and uninstall when you need to move the car seat. Not too hard to get it correctly installed in a secure position.The strap tension adjustment is easy to use, probably the easiest I've ever used and I know my way around a car seat. You just push the button in the front bottom of the seat and pull the shoulder straps to loosen them, put the baby in the seat and buckle up the harness, then pull the strap on the adjuster at the bottom to make tight with the harness at the armpits of the baby.It comes with a latch system and a tether so you can use either option.The whole seat cover comes off easily and is machine washable. Let's face it, babies are messy and tend to spit up, but the cover came out looking great after going through the washing machine.What it Lacks:The cup holder is pretty weak. We didn't end up using it, one reason being that it's in an awkward spot and would have probably been bothering my daughter in the seat next to it, and we couldn't actually get it to stay on. Even if we could get it to stay, it doesn't look like it is very durable.This car seat is supposed to be a seat for a baby 5-40 lbs, but does not come with any additional padding for an infant. I think a 5 lb baby would be way too tiny for such a large seat, but that's my opinion. I like keeping my babies in an infant car seat until they turn a year old because I like to be able to remove the seat from the car to carry them and also, the infant seats just seem more comfortable for a tiny baby who sleeps all the time. My son was over a year and a pretty solid toddler when I purchased this, so it was perfect for him.Overall, it's been a great car seat! We've been fortunate to not have been in any accidents, so I can't say for sure how it holds up under trauma, but for us it's been perfect. We were on a budget so the price was the main reason for choosing this car seat, but it turned out to be great! I like the simple design and I've been happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "SHIPPINGItem arrived in time as promised tucked in a sturdy cardboard shipping box. Both the box and product were intact.WHAT IS GOOD ABOUT ITI already have an expensive ( I paid $250) child car seat from another brand but I wanted one especially for the upcoming travel weight being the concern. This car seat is very light but it is also sturdy. Adjusting the harness is easy and convenient. Adjusting the harness on the other car seat ( the expensive one ) is a Hercules task. The seating pad is soft yet firm. Fits perfect for my daughter. Has a cup holder that is detachable. The best part of this car seat is its weight. It is so light I could carry it all over the terminal without feeling the weight. It fits perfectly in a Delta domestic flight which was a Boeing ( Not sure about the Aircraft model) . However, It did not fit on a Spirit flight which was an Airbus. I had to do the gate check in, for that particular flight.It looks sturdy and feels well built but can not comment on the quality until it is out to a test which I would not want. Going through the previous reviews, I remember some one mentioning about the real life test and how it saved the child. So I feel, it should do well in case of an unfortunate event.WHAT IS NOT SO GOOD ABOUT ITThe only minor issue is with the cup holder. It does not stay in place when you load it up with a heavy cup. I can use some glue to put it in place but then it is beats the idea of \"detachable cup holder\".Bottom LineIt is value for money and the best car seat If you have to carry it on a flight or use it on a rental car.Would I recommend it to a friendYes, I would.",

                "reviewText": "This carseat is a great deal. Carseat safety standards are all the same. It doesn't have the bells and whistles that other seats to but it does what it is supposed to do. There are a few small issues that I have with it but generally it is a great seat.1. The cupholder - Yes, it's flimsy as everyone says but not a big deal.2. Strap release - The button is along the front of the seat so trying to push it or pull the strap to tighten the harness is a little hard when the seat is rear facing.3. Latch System belt - VERY hard to tighten. It doesn't seem to want to pull tight enough and is at a funny angle to tighten it, especially in a smaller car (Corolla). It's not impossible though. We got it tight enough eventually and it's not like you have to go through that process much if you are leaving the seat in the same car most/all of the time.4. Not much cushion. Compared to the little infant car seat that we graduated from it's a little hard but honestly, my 1-year old falls asleep on a wood floor covered with a small rug so he doesn't seem to mind this at all.The good things make up for it:1. Fabric is soft comfy for the little guy.2. The price is awesome especially if you are buying a seat for each of 2 cars.3. Pretty easy installation - save the latch system belt4. Small enough for a small car - we put it in the middle of the bach seat and it fits perfectly in our Corolla.5. Will be easy to turn around to forward facing when he's bigger.",
