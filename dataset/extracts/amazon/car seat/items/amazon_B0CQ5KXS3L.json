                "reviewText": "We ordered this for a road trip that we were taking for my 3 year old. She is in a standard carseat with cupholders on each side. She usually stores snacks in one of the cupholders, which makes a mess. This fit very snug into her cup holder. The tray is made of silicone, so it is a tad flimsy, but holds up to snacks just fine. I love that she still has a cup holder built in still. The size of the tray is perfect- not too large or too small. The tray has a lip around it as well, which helps snacks stay on the tray and not all over the floor of my car. For all those not parents who still say they will never allow their fictional child to eat in their car, best wishes on any long trip ever. We have 4 kids with many activities, so we tend to spend a lot of time in our car- this tray helps so much and our toddler loves that it is her favorite color- blue. Best of all, silicone wipes clean and washes so easily.",

I was hoping to find something that wouldn\u2019t disturb his iPad on the lap time, as well as an idea for portioning his food. This was the idea!The material is waterproof, and flexible. I love the vibrant, playful color. The cup holder part works like bus clips on cars which I think is brilliant.The actual cup size will shrink a little bit, which makes it hard for my child to use average sippy cups. Other than that, I don\u2019t really have any bad things to say about this. 5 stars!!",

                "reviewText": "My almost 3-year-old loves this tray! In my husband\u2019s car, the car seat has two drink holders (one on each side). In my car, the car seat only has one drink holder. She likes the car seat with two drink holders because she likes to put her drink in one and her small toys in the other. When she\u2019s in my car, she can\u2019t do that. I\u2019ve been trying to avoid taking my car, to avoid a \u201cterrible two tantrum\u201d, but then came across this. She was SO happy to have this! It fits into the drink holder and stays there without falling out. She has already started using it and has been so happy with it! That makes one happy momma!",

I fits really nicely into my car seat and is pretty sturdy. My daughter can rip it out if she doesn\u2019t want it in there, but it is much more sturdy and efficient than others I have tried.",

                "reviewText": "A great idea to add extra play room on this small tray. Can be used for snacks/food and for toys. My granddaughters love spreading out their snacks in the compartments and still have room for their small cars and items to play with. This feels very thick and heavy duty like it wont tear or have issues in the future. This is a great find to help along the short and long rides when the toddlers are in a car seat that has a cup holder that can be used to add the tray. Easy to press in and it holds pretty well. The child can not pull it out from within the seat, the 4 year old can get it out when she is standing in the car waiting to get into her seat.",
