                "reviewText": "This is a really nice car seat. It is very versatile in the fact that it grows with baby. It can be used as a front facing or rear facing. It has three levels of recline and the height can be easily adjusted. What I really appreciate is that the car seat is a bit narrower than others I have come across. On trips its hard having car seat(s), especially large ones since they take up so much space. This one is a bit narrower which helps cut down on that but is still spacious enough to give baby plenty of room. I like how the majority of the car seat is covered in padded fabric which not only makes it look nice but makes it a bit more comfortable. Overall, this car seat is super versatile, good quality, and saves a bit of space.",
