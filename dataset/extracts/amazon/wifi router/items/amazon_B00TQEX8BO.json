Despite its small size, it handles multiple devices seamlessly, making it ideal for both home and on-the-go use. I was particularly impressed with its ability to maintain a strong signal even in areas with weak Wi-Fi coverage.*Versatility:*What sets the TL-WR802N apart is its versatility. It can function as a router, access point, client, or repeater, giving users a wide range of options to suit their specific needs. This flexibility makes it a valuable tool for various scenarios, from creating a temporary Wi-Fi hotspot to extending the range of an existing network.**Service Review: Jonaire**I also want to commend the excellent service provided by Jonaire. From the moment I placed my order to the post-purchase inquiries, their customer service team demonstrated professionalism and responsiveness. The staff was knowledgeable about the products and provided clear, concise answers to my queries.*Customer Support:*Jonaire's was a pleasure to deal with. He was prompt in addressing my concerns and provided helpful guidance when I needed assistance with the product setup. His commitment to customer satisfaction is evident, and it greatly enhanced my overall shopping experience.In conclusion, I highly recommend both the TP-Link TL-WR802N for its impressive performance and versatility, and Jonaire for his exceptional customer service. My experience with both the product and the retailer has been overwhelmingly positive.",

                "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2017",
                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Got this for my Xbox One S. Didn't expect it to be this good!",
                "reviewText": "I got the TP-Link N300 Travel Router (without the USB port) specifically for my Xbox One S. I didn't expect it to be this good!My university uses an indirect wi-fi login system (we connect to the open university network, which brings up an internet page asking us to login with our university ID and password to authenticate \u2014 similar in system to most hotels and airports), which the Xbox can't handle. So I decided to create a small internal network in my room that has its own SSID and password. I went with a mini router rather than just a range extender because this mini router has greater functionality for around the same price as most extenders.Size: As you can see in my pictures, the length/width is a little more than that of two quarters side-by-side, and the thickness of 3/4ths a quarter. I was surprised by how small it was when I opened it.Accessories: It comes with an ethernet cable, USB charger, wall adapter (though this is a bit clunky for modern standards), travel pouch, Wi-fi Info Card, and the standard instructions.Setup: Quick and easy, though you'll need to have a computer (I'm not sure if it works on a smartphone/tablet) to access the setup page. It took me about five minutes to set mine up in Access Point Mode. Basically, you plug in the router for your preferred mode as per the image/instructions. You then connect to your router from your computer using the password on the Wi-Fi Info Card and go to tplinkwifi(dot)net to do a quick setup. Here you can choose what mode you want to use the router in, change your SSID, password, etc. Then reboot to reconfigure the router.Modes: There are five modes -- two for travel and three for at home use. I went with the Access Point (AP) Mode for my uses, but I probably could have just gone ahead with the default Wireless Router mode. The ethernet port in my room was too far away from my Xbox to use Client mode. Regardless, it\u2019s working great. I\u2019ve attempted to give explanations for the different modes below, but I\u2019m not particularly knowledgeable in this so please correct me if there are any inaccuracies.For Travel:1. Wireless Router (default): Basically, it turns a wired internet connection wireless.2. Hotspot Router: I would best describe this as taking an open (and unsecured) wi-fi connection and making it password protected (personal hotspot). The router takes the unsecured wi-fi connection and creates a secured wi-fi/wired connection, and you can have one device connected directly to the router and have the rest of your devices using your protected wi-fi at the same time. Useful for connecting to the internet in public places like cafes. I believe it's also great for hotel rooms where only one device can use the internet per room. Connect this and all your devices can use the internet.For Home:3. Range Extender: Similar in nature to the Hotspot Router Mode -- it goes wi-fi to wi-fi, except this mode uses your home's network and maintains the same password as your home's AP. It's to extend your home's wi-fi to reach any wi-fi dead spots in your house (like the attic or basement, or that weird corner of the room where you like to huddle and binge watch Netflix but just happens to be the same place where wi-fi connectivity is super sketch and the video never loads). You can use the router for both wired and wi-fi connections simultaneously.4. Client: Sort of the opposite of the Wireless Router mode -- this takes a wi-fi network and makes it wired so that devices that don't have wi-fi capabilities can connect to the internet. It's great for smart TVs, game consoles, printers.5. Access Point: Same as the Wireless Router mode, takes a wired network and makes it wi-fi.Speed: There wasn\u2019t really any compromises made with the download speed. My university has incredibly fast wi-fi (though my dorm isn\u2019t as fast as our libraries), so I\u2019m glad that wasn\u2019t sacrificed. The upload speeds weren't as consistent, but still not bad. You can see the speed test results in my pictures.Overall, I'm really liking this mini router. The size is perfect for travel (it's smaller than my Macbook Pro's MagSafe adapter\u2026!), and the setup was straightforward. Definitely a recommended buy.",

                "reviewText": "Okay let me say first off that the product its self is great. So I thought several of these over the years and I've loved them. But I've noticed that after about two years that and a glitch. And for thirty bucks I honestly have no problem with buying new one every couple years. With how well it works. but the thing of the matter is that when I called their tech support I was about ready to lose my mind. first off the guy that answered the phone was horribly rude very disrespectful demanding that I tell him answers to things as well as when I ask to talk to a manager. He states there is not one and then he proceeded to tell me that if I'd like to talk to another associate that I would have to call back and go through the whole 35-minute process again. And then he hung up on me. Yes yes I did say he hung up on me the customer. I am so very upset right now. And the fact that they employ this person makes me want to just freaking never buy the product again. And I love this product tried several different once and this is the one I always come back to. But now meet my friends Amazon and soon social media will also know what kind of people they're employing. now I wrote them an email stating what happened from my point of view and I'm sure the employee will stay his point of you as well and they always say there's three sides to every story. So we'll see what happens have not Amazon yall need to step in and say something to this company about the people they employ. Sorry I don't mean to make the super long I'm just extremely irate. And have been for several hours now trying to deal with my messed up tp-link two young children that don't have internet a Google hub that won't work and just getting off work so yeah I'm a little pissed. we all have a great night I recommend the product for the company itself not so good",
