                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars AC1000 R6060 -- Inadequate for 100mbps ISP Service",
                "reviewText": "Unfortunately Amazon throws all the reviews together for several DIFFERENT Netgear router models. For example, I am writing about the AC1000 R6080 but of the 1900+ reviews linked to that model's page, the vast majority are for other models, like the Nighthawk or R700. So when customers ask a question the answer is often wrong as the one answering is answering for the model they bought, when the one asking might be asking about a different model... and everyone thinks they're on the same page, when they're not. I really wish Amazon would keep reviews for specific models separate unless the only difference is something immaterial like color (which doesn't apply to routers but could to things like tablets).Case in point: When looking at the AC1000 R6080 here, and jumping down to the reviews, then entering \"QoS\" in the question field, several people asked about QoS and the answer was the router has great QoS controls. In fact, the AC1000 has no QoS controls. I believe it might have Dynamic QoS which is not configurable by the end user. The normal \"QoS\" tab does not appear anywhere in the config menus and QoS is not mentioned anywhere in the manual. I clicked on the reply that answered \"Yes\" and Amazon linked it to a picture of a different model -- the Nighthawk. But you wouldn't know that by just reading the answer (unless you clicked on it too).On to the review. I got this router -- the AC1000 R6080 -- to work with a Zoom 5370 16x4 686mbps cable modem. I returned the router after just 2 days use.Cons (starting with less important to more):1. LEDs are on TOP so you can't see them without standing up.2. No QoS or even a way to see how the Dynamic QoS is set (if it even has that)3. Worst of all, *wired* connectivity through router is only ~70% of what it is directly through the modem. (117mbps modem/84mbps router)4. Wifi is also slower than normal (45-54mbps).5. The above last two cons are due to 10/100 LAN ports (including the Internet port that goes to modem) which are too slow if you have 100mbps service or higher.Pros:1. It's returnable.Although it's rated for 300mbps + 700mbps (using both bands) which equals 1Gb\u2026 it is not a \"gigabit router\". The LAN ports are 10/100 (operate at 100mbps minus overhead) which is practically legacy now. It would probably work well for broadband up to 50mbps perhaps, but if you have a faster service the 10/100 LAN ports will bottleneck your connection.It's hard to understand why Netgear would make an AC model with 10/100 LANs since 802.11ac is the newest, fastest wifi adapter standard. Even though you can certainly have an ac adapter and only pay for slow broadband, the router should meet the standards AC is capable of handling. Especially considering it is 'parading' as a '1Gb router' by the 300 + 700 rating.To get your money's worth of ISP service of 100mbps or higher, you will need to get a true gigabit router, identified by 10/100/1000 LAN ports (1Gb ports). The modem will make a 1Gb connection to the router in this case and deliver the full speed of your service at 100+mbps (or higher) with no overhead loss.I replaced the R6080 with the NETGEAR AC1200 Smart WiFi Router - Dual Band Gigabit (R6230) , and sure enough, speed wired through the router is now identical to being wired directly to the modem (117mbps either way). Even Wifi improved by 30+% thanks to the faster connection between modem and router... the R6080 delivered just 45-54mbps while the R6232 delivers 75mbps over wifi. (That's nearly what the R6080 delivered WIRED!) It also has QoS controls and a whole lot of other options, PLUS a separate, physical, wifi on/off switch\u2026 so you can turn the radios off at night when you're done online, but leave the router up to save power cycling (which can theoretically wear these devices). And a physical switch is a whole lot more convenient that having to use the GUI to turn radios off/on, or use a schedule when your own schedule varies. Even better, it's only about $15 more.Conclusion: If you want to future proof your investment, get an AC gigabit router with 10/100/1000 LAN ports. It will work with slower services but will also be there for you when you advance to faster services so you won't have to buy a router twice.Note: So far the R6230 is not listed as being DD-WRT tested, for those interested in flashing that [optional] custom FW, but for all I know someone's already done it. I haven't gotten that far yet.",

Our previous router was over 300Mbs (using the same cable modem) but for $39 it might be fast enough. Will give it a week and update.Range \u2014 it has decent range.
