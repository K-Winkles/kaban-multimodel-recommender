It also have a nice VPN app that works well with the router. I tried the Asus ZenWiFi AX6600 but this is a lot more stable and I don\u2019t have WiFi dropping like I did with the Asus. I\u2019ve owned this router for more than a year and really appreciate it. The company makes great enterprise equipment too and know what they are doing. I went to school for a network specialist and have my CCNA and and have dabbled in a fair share of networking equipment. Give this a shot, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be disappointed. Take care!",

                "reviewText": "I loved everything about this router. Setup was easy and the control given was perfect. Everything was fast and connection was strong all through the house. If I didn't have any issues it would be an easy 5 star.I don't know if the problem was with the router being a lemon or some issue with the signal coming in from the modem. But after 6 hours of great strong use it just stopped broadcasting. SSID gone. Anything wired in was good to go though. After rebooting both router and modem it came back on. Only to die an hour later. After dealing with this for a few hours I unfortunately had to request a refund. Old router has been up nonstop without issues since.",
