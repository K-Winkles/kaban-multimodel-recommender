                "reviewText": "Wi-Fi signal did not hit anywhere close to 300mbps even when using a lan connection. My device would not properly reset to factory settings when the rest button was pressed. I bought a slightly more expensive router and got to 300mbps while keeping the rest of my setup the same. Do not buy this router! Spend $50-100 on a better, more reliable brand of router.",
