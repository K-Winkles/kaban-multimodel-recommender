Instructions were worthless, Arris app doesn\u2019t work. Then I opened the nighthawk app and after a few minutes the app did basically all the work of setup. After that, works amazing.

                "reviewText": "Summary: After years with Apple Extreme Base Stations, I switched over to a Netgear Nighthawk X6 and loved its performance in our basically square 800 sf apartment. When we moved to a long, linear 1800 sf condo, I need something to extend our network to cover the master bedroom and back deck. Less than a year later, I'll never purchase another Netgear device.Installation: Gets a extra star here, simply because all you do is plug it in. Literally the only redeeming virtue this product has.Setup:This device uses a web interface to get it setup, which is different from the interface that you use to setup the Nighthawk Router. Like any web based router setup interface, its clunky, loads sporadically, and in dire need of a proper rebuild. It would take a half dozen tries to correctly connect to my router, regardless of being no more than 10 feet apart in direct sight-lines. And dealing with a triple band connection, it would inevitably connect to either the 2.4 ghz or the 5.0 ghz band, but not both simultaneously.UsageOh where to begin. The SmartConnect setup is a surefire way to have a bunch of devices that can't properly navigate the different bands. They just wont connect at all. So go ahead and disable that from the get-go. The OneWifi name is how these setups should all work in theory but in practice with this device, its really just a great way to suffer constant service interruption with spotty handoffs. The extender will rebroadcast the same SSIDs, regardless of whether it has a connection to the router or not, so we'd find ourselves losing internet connection as we moved from one point in the apartment to another, despite having a full strength connection to the network.I was unplugging, resetting, reconfiguring or otherwise manipulating this extender to work with our router constantly. No matter if it was 10 feet away with direct line of site, 30 feet away with direct line of site, or 45 feet away with indirect LOS, connection between the extender and the base station was spotty at best.Even when it was working \"properly\" we'd be lucky to see 100 MBs down (on a 330 MBs connection)App:Our Nighthawk router required the Netgear Nighthawk app to be managed from my phone. Our Nighthawk extender required the Netgear Genie app to be managed from my phone. And you only new which device you're connected to, and thus which app to use, when you opened the app and got a \"this device is not supported\" error.Technical Support:This is where Netgear is truly laughable. The device comes with a one-year warranty and after CONSTANT issues, multiple ground-up network rebuilds, and as much dialing in as I could manage, I was still frustrated by terrible performance and called Netgear to see about getting a replacement unit, as clearly something was malfunctioning. Well, the only way to get a support tech to even talk about your issues and possibly get to a point where they will give you a return authorization on a warranty claim, you must sign up for a technical support contract. I spent over an hour arguing with a technician, telling him I wouldn't pay nearly 75% of the cost of the device, just to confirm that it is a piece of junk, and to just give me an authorization number. In the end, all he would do is email me a few tech support \"articles\" (roughly two sentences and some bullet points) that anyone who spent even a few minutes trying to troubleshoot their device on Netgear's website would have found.In the end... this device, and Netgear as a company, is garbage. If you have a Nighthawk router today and want to upgrade to a mesh experience, do yourself a favor and just sell your hardware and go purchase a vastly superior product.I picked up the eero Pro setup on Prime Day and not only was it stupid easy to set up, but in a month of use, we've had nothing but incredibly stable 330 MBs down performance in every corner of our home (and well out into the yard/street) and have never had to even power cycle any of the devices once. And all my devices that couldn't make heads or tails of Netgear's SmartConnect/OneWifi protocols have no issue navigating the eero. Mesh the way it's supposed to be.",

                "reviewText": "When this works, it is fantastic. It is replacing a TP-Link extender which worked ok but not nearly as well when the EX7500 is working. Once setup, the performance I get from it is 99% as good as when I am 5 feet from the router. The lights on the unit though are sometimes confusing. The 5g light is supposed to be blue when it is connected with a strong signal. Sometimes though its amber which means only an ok signal but if I do a speed test, performance is still excellent. When the light is off, it means no connection but guess what, still gets great performance.Set up is not straight forward. The quick start guide is missing a lot of information like how to use the Netgear setup app as it doesn't give a link. I had to go into my router settings to find the ap address which then got me to the setup page. I finally muddled through it and finally got it setup.During setup, it found a firmware update. I followed the instructions exactly. It told me not to unplug or turn off the unit during the update. I then got a message it was updating and it should take a couple of minutes. Well after a few minutes it wasn't working at all. I let it sit for a long while with no change. Finally I unplugged it, then pressed factory reset once I plugged it back in and then went through setup again. Luckily the firmware update had worked and I was able to get it going fairly easily.I know just hope it keeps working and the lights on the unit will really reflect the state of the connections.",

                "reviewText": "While this thing worked great for extending coverage in my home it took a 130-165mbs speed down to 30-20Mbs about 30 feet away through drywall. Sure I had signal but it was very slow. My little $25 netgear ex6120 extender (which i plugged into the same outlet) i had since 2019 actually gives 70Mbs. Not sure how netgears newer and supposedly improved product performed worse than the old supposedly inferior product. I'm just going to return this and stick with my old extender. i made the mistake of assuming newer tech would mean better performance.",
