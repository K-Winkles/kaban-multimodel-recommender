After doing some research on how to set up WiFi, I started to suffer from brain fog and came to the conclusion that there must be simple way to set up WiFi without doing any more damage to my brain. Then I came across this product. I liked the space-saving design with the enclosed antenna with no metal protrusions to poke myself with being the klutz that I am.After an easy setup, I turned my new laptop on and crossed my fingers. I was only about 15 feet from the router so I figured that I should get a good signal and the signal was very good. I could surf the Web and watch videos with no problems whatsoever. I have a small 800 square foot house and took my laptop into a room about 40 feet from the router with a couple of walls in between. I had a strong signal there too and had no problems using my laptop. I have no idea what the maximum reach of this router is. I'm not about to stand in the middle of the street in front of my house and risk instant death to find out.My first experience with setting up and using WiFi turned out quite well thanks to this \"cute\" little electronic marvel.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because it was inexpensive and to see if my WRT54G was, in fact, dying. My home network has been suffering with frequent disconnects from AT&T DSL. The line checked okay with the modem (Motorola 2200-02-1006) plugged into the computer, so the WRT54G became the #1 suspect. Played with cables, phone lines, filters, and the Linksys settings & firmware with no change. In contrast, the N150R has been connected to the same IP address for over 2 days and counting. (The WRT54G is a very fine product. I got mine years ago and always left it on. It served me well and will be retired with full honors.) Setting up the N150R was a snap: connected it to both the modem (already in bridge mode) and my computer with ethernet cables, turned it on, opened a web browser, and the darn thing identified my dsl modem and provided on screen boxes to enter my user name and password. I was logged back into AT&T and on the internet in about as long as it takes to read this. (It even changed its address so as not to conflict with the modem address.) Later on I tinkered around in its menu, set things up as I like them, and backed up the configuration. It works with everything at home: PCs w/ b & g wireless, ipod, laptops, DSs, etc... So, so far, very good.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars CHEAP, but not a good wireless router solution",
                "reviewText": "I purchased this wireless router for a home-based solution over 2 months ago, because I had purchased other low-cost items (network switches) from this manufacturer previously... with no problem. The installation was easy, but the router performed so poorly in both performance and dropped wireless signal connections that I replaced it with another brand immediately. I would have returned this router long ago, but I am way too busy to waste any additional time on this particular device. I threw it in the trash. The item cost was under $20, so I figure I got just about what I paid for. I would NOT recommend anyone purchase this router, as it is very problematic right out of the box and no amount of \"tweaking\" or firmware updates helped at all.",
