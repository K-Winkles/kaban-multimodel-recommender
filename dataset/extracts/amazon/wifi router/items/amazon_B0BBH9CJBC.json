                "reviewText": "This box is just the right size for my Google Fiber router, modem, Google phone box and Deco Mesh System sentinel node. The most awkward part of the whole setup was the power strips for 5 power bricks that are all different shapes and sizes. I highly recommend getting some kind of flexible strip or \"medusa -like\" 5-1 cord. Otherwise, the bricks will severely limit how much usable room there is within the box (wasted a lot of time trying to make a standard strip work). The other thing I would recommend is to use the shortest ethernet cables you can find and tie up the thin power cords, as it easily becomes a rat's nest inside. But the good news is, even it if IS a rat's nest, you don't have to look at it. once you close the sliding door on all of that. I have mine sitting on the floor- doesn't stick out very far at all. I have fiber, 2 ethernet cables and a telephone line running under my house and coming up through a hole in the floor. This box goes right over the hole, covering all the cables up. My router is turned backwards for easy access to all those wires, but the wifi signal is still fine, throughout my house. The box is nice lightly finished pine wood, and is super easy to put together- all you need is a Phillips screwdriver. You can test filling it up before installing the 8 brass screws to keep it together. There is actually quite a lot of room inside, if you have the right kind of power strip/electrical cord setup. The biggest problem with router setups is just all the wires and bricks This box hides all of that mess effectively, in a compact package, and will allow air circulation, and you can still get to your internet components easily. I wish it were big enough to work with my UPS, but my router is too tall to fit in the same box. A small price to pay, really, as there are surge protected flexible solutions out there that will easily fit. I suppose one could just use two of them, mount them side by side and have plenty of room for anything like that.",

Also,I have it sitting on carpet and not wall mounted, not sure if that\u2019s contributing to the problem or not. The front panel that slides in just doesn\u2019t seem to be sized right to stay in place. Otherwise, it conceals the router and modem just like we needed it to!",
