I live on the first floor and my security camera is on the 2nd floor on an outside window. I\u2019ve tried everything to get my camera to have more signal and only a very small change. I thought it would provide my camera with all the bars. And it gave my camera one little tiny bar of wifi. I first set it up close to the router. Then I put it halfway so I plug it in the hallway. And now it is plugged on the 2nd floor in my neighbors front bedroom. And it\u2019s just so frustrating because it does say wall penetration & it does say 10,000square feet. But the slim to none difference it has made on my security system I don\u2019t think is worth the money. Big disappointment. I read all the good reviews and thought I\u2019d give it a try. Idk what else to do. I will be returning unfortunately",
