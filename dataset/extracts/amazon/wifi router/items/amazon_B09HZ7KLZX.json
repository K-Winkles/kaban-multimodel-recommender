                "reviewText": "EDIT: 1/24/24Less than two years later: I ended up getting another set. So I literally have 6 of these things in my 2200 square foot house. The POS is crap. The wifi just doesn't work anymore. My laptop is literally 20 feet away in the next room and through an open door it gets 0.05 Mbps download.I wanted to get this because it was half the price of the eero. While it was \"easy\" to install, things started going wrong right away. First, the range ins not at all as advertised. I have the main router on the first floor, and a hub on the floor above. They are not more than 15 feet apart from each other, yet the hub gets a very poor signal from the main router below. The application is pure garbage coded by an intern. Several of the functions do not work, and after hours with tech support they agree that it --should-- work, but they just cant figure it out. They basically said, lets try a replacement. At first I was willing to just live with it because the network works fine, it was just the application. However, in the last few days the entire network has started to just drop out making me wait for about 5 minutes for it to reconnect. This includes a hard-wired connection from my PC to the main router. I'm going to go ahead and try the replacement. The other thing that I dont like (though its probably viewed as an intentional feature) is that there is not customisation of the settings. You cant open ports, or do custom routing, and some information is stored directly at Motorola. I may just go back to my nighthawk and range extenders broadcasting 1000 different SSID's......sigh.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the Motorola MH7601 to extend and complement my existing Xfinity network to provide faster WiFi speed in the lower level of my home to maximize the multi-media gaming and movie entertainment experience. The setup of the device was super easy and works great with my existing router. I simply followed the little booklet that came in the box, downloaded the MotoSync App to my iPhone, plugged it into my router, and then followed an intuitive step-by-step installation process which, to the amazement of my family, took me less than 20 minutes. I never even had to call for any technical support. Just make sure you have at least one additional ethernet connection available on your router. When I then compared the high-speed performance over my regular WiFi connection I gained an additional 200+ Mbps in speed which makes a huge difference downloading games to my Xbox and streaming 4K TV video content. The coolest part is the security center on the unit and app where I get alerts and see if there are any vulnerabilities detected. The same day I installed the device I was alerted by the app of a potential unidentified device on my network that I could instantly block from accessing my network, which after a further investigation turned out to be one of my own devices. From now on when I have guests at my home I can give them my new guest access from my MH7601 so I can keep the network secure. I HIGHLY recommend the MH7601 for anyone who is looking for an easy way to get greater WiFi coverage with, in my case, even better performance.",

                "reviewText": "I have 300 mps internet thru Verizon. My current Tenda system (which i had for 3 years with zero issues) only supported bandwidth of 100mps. So I decided to upgrade and purchase this Motorola set.Set up the 3 nodes on 10/06/23 as well as the Motosync app and had no issues until 10/30/23. That evening i noticed all the nodes were blinking blue. I thought that it was some type of update occurring, so I went to the Motosync app and it said my phone was offline and not connected to the internet. I assumed it was a temporary issue (still had full internet access) but it continued thru the next day. I sent an email to Motorola support and received the following:\"We're having a server problem at our service provider. That is what's causing problems with your MH7603 and some other mesh routers. We're doing our best to address it to get it back online. In the meantime, your internet connectivity should still be functional. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.\"The next night (with all the nodes still blinking) I began losing internet signal on my second floor (where one of the nodes is placed). I sent a follow up email to Motorola and received the following:\"Unfortunately, the issue still exists today. I don't have any updates except that engineering is working to resolve the problem. Thanks for your patience.\"At that point, knowing i was just barely in the return window, i re-connected my old Tenda system and boxed up the Motorola and returned to Amazon today. Since i had no issues with the Tenda system, decided to upgrade to their MW6 model.Assuming this is why this Motorola set is only priced at $49.99",
