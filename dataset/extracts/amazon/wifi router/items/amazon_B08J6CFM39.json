                "reviewText": "The Asus RT-AC68U is a huge improvement over my old Netgear N600 router and over either of the Arris Modem/Routers that TWC provided me when I upgraded my Internet service their 200Mbs Internet package. In terms of specifics:1) I have verified that my connection exceeds 200Mbs on a consistent basis when testing on a wired connection. I replaced my old cable modem and the Arris Modem/router with a Surfboard SB-6183. I tested the wired connection both directly connected to the Surfboard and via the RT-AC68U. The only difference was a little bit of latency that showed up on the ping tests. The Netgear N600 tops out a 100Mbs as it doesn't support Gigabit Ethernet (which I also verified with testing).2) On the 2.4Ghz side the Arris Modem/routers that TWC and I rented were pure garbage in terms of range. I live in a 3 story town home with the modem and router on the top floor (and I am unable to move it). My wife's Asus laptop supports 802.11n but only for 2.4GHz. With the old Netgear modem, she could get 6 to 16Mbs in the Kitchen/family room on the other side of the house on the 2nd floor. With the Arris modem/routers, this dropped to 1.6Mbs and failed completely if she took it to the furthest corner. Also and to me inexplicably, the upload speed was always faster than the download speed. With the RT-AC68U she moved up to 33Mbs on a regular basis. Even with line of sight to the router, the arris modem/router was poor. So much so that I setup a power-line adapter for her to use at her desk. The RT-AC68U totally eliminated her need to use a powerline adapter to get acceptable speed.3) On the 5.0ghz speed, the results were less dramatic, but still significant with a much stronger signal and faster speeds. For example, an old HP (2010 vintage) laptop with 3bars of speed consistently gets over 60Mbs while the Arris modem/routers could barely provide a 5.0Ghz connection at all.4) The only laptop we have with 802.11ac is my daughter's Surface Pro 3. I was not able to test with it while she was home from college this last weekend, but she did say that she is now able to get a connection in her bedroom, where she sometimes had problems with the Arris equipment.Another significant plus, is that the guest network connections are fabulously flexible. We regularly host a homeowners association group meeting in our house and I was able to setup a dedicated network for that with no connection to our equipment and setup a separate guest connection for my daughter's friends so they can connect to our wireless printer.I have not noted any of the dropout problems that others have experienced (we have 4 laptops of varing ages and brands), 4 cell phones (samsung and google), and a kindle touch.I am rating it 4 star for several reasons:a) I haven't been able to get a wireless signal over 100Mbs even with line of sight to the router.b) Several key features such as beam-forming are hidden in the professional settings and are not defaults.c) Changing the modem so it can only be administered via a wired connection is hard to do. The default is that any computer with a connection can reconfigure the router making it a requirement to change the password. I prefer a even more secure wired connection. I achieved this by giving my desktop computer a static IP address and then restricting the administration to that one IP address. The only nit is that the RT-AC68U displays a totally bizarre message about connection settings on wireless computers when they attempt to connect to the webpage rather than a straightforward message like \"Connection to the RT-AC68U is only allowed via specified IP addresses\".d) The time that the DHCP server with the RT-AC68U retains an IP address association with a mac address is limited to 1 day. With the old Netgear N600, I could set this to 1 year (and possibly more). I want a high value as it allows equipment to connect without the \"someother computer is using this IP address\" message that we used to occasionally get. I found this eliminated \"support calls\" from my wife and children.Edit April 2019. In the summer of 2017, I replaced this Asus unit with a Netgear Orbi. It went into the garage as an emergency backup. In 2019, my daughter bought a condo (1200 sq. ft) and I took the Asus over so she didn't have to pay rental on a router to Spectrum. I was totally surprised by all of the software enhancements that Asus had rolled out. Among these, It now is capable of being a node in a wireless network (not tested). I found the Asus provided Wireless excellent service on her 100mb internet connection. She has two 4k TVs (one wired, one wireless) connected along with computers and cell phones. So far everything is great. Note these were software upgrades, the top speed of the device and hardware limited protocols did not change but for a smaller home this seems to be a great fit.",

                "reviewText": "Bought a pair of these for my parent's new home network. I've owned ASUS routers in the past, and all have been outstanding workhorses that have lasted many years (definitely outlasted any Netgear or TLink products I've tried). Setup was a breeze, and even though I've never set up an AImesh network before (I've been able to survive off a single router in my previous house), the AImesh setup was also very simple. I did have to buy a third router to put between these two to get a stronger signal strength to the basement, but again, adding that third router into the mesh and configuring the network was very easy. The hardest part of it all was figuring out where to put the third router where there was access to a power outlet, be relatively unobstructed, and yet not bothered/knocked over by nosey cats - lol :DASUS also has a very good computer interface for managing your routers and network, and their mobile app is also very nice though does lack the full capabilities of the computer/web interface (but still has a number of useful features and information). I was able to set up the basic network using just the app, and only really needed the computer interface for some advanced fine tuning.As an additional note, I bought this particular model because the computers here are a bit older, they don't have a ton of devices needing to be on the network, and there's usually only two of them using the network at any one point - so a more recent model with more bells/whistles/technology/speeds was not needed. Some good advice for choosing the right router for your network is to know what your current devices are capable of, how many devices/users will be using your network at one time, and how likely you are to buy devices that will have or need the latest technology (which usually only really applies to heavy computer gamers, or families that have multiple people streaming). You don't necessarily need the latest and greatest router just because it has the most recent technology. Know your needs, usage, and what your devices are actually capable of. This router was perfect for our needs: video appointments with doctors and team video meetings are smooth, and I'm able to play my MMORPG perfectly fine while visiting with no noticable lag and still have low ping, and the WiFi signal strength is good throughout the house. So while this is not the most deluxe or latest ASUS router model, it is perfectly capable of handling today's network needs, is easy to set up, and also very simple to integrate into an AImesh network if you need to extend your network for better whole-house coverage. In addition, this particular model allows you to turn off the LED lights, which is useful if you don't want those lights bothering you at night.",

                "reviewText": "My home network manages traffic from:2 iPads1 iPhone1 android phone2 TV1 Nvidia Shield1 Amazon Alexa1 weather station monitoring displayNumerous Hue lights1 USB 3 T network driveI was replacing a decade old AirPort Extreme as Apple had discontinued support and I wanted more granular configurability. The replacing router arrived a day early and I spent the afternoon setting up to suit my needs.Router configuration ( 10 years ago) was black magic, filled with frustrations and confusion. Not any more. ASUS has it dumbed down to a point if you can read and click, the basic configuration and connectivity is a 10 (or less) minute process. Once that is completed the fine tuning is next. I enabled the firewall and malware detection first. Malware protection is a huge plus and eliminates the need to run on individual devices.After that I set various priorities. I made streaming video priority over other functions. I then enabled traffic monitoring so I could understand how much data was being used, by whom, what application etc. This revealed a disconcerting stat. The Nvidia Shield is transmitting over 125 megs of data each hour. This needs more research and I have narrowed it down to one of three apps I run. It will take a few days to eliminate the apps one by one.Wi-Fi is a beast. I have excellent coverage in every room with signal strength of -38 dBm and 340 Mbs at most distant point.Download speeds are consistently faster but that is subjective as my ISP may be having good days. I am paying for 25 Mbs download speeds and Analoti indicates I am getting between 20 and 50 most days.Wi-Fi networks of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz are separate networks. 5 is faster but is an \u2018in room\u2019 network as 5 is always a weaker signal. It is nice to have the choice.I had intended to run the WRT-Merlin firmware but the OEM is so good I see no reason to change.I can recommend this router to anyone looking for a good sold performing device.",
