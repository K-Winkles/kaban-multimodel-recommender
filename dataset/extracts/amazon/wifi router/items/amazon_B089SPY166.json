Both router and modem fit in the large EMF bag and have proper ventilation. To minimize radiation leaking, I sealed it with a rubber band. Signal strength is still strong within the room but has been weakened beyond that. EMF reading with meter is not zeroed out but it remains within the \"safe\" zone.",
