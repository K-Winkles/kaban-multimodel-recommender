                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is a very capable router at a very reasonable price. The wifi range is as good as I've seen with any router I've used, and I've used a few of them. For most users, the ease of setup and wireless range will be exactly what they need. For more advanced users with very specific needs, this may not be the right one for you. Here are some impressions:* The iOS app is really easy to use. You can have this thing set up in a matter of under 5 minutes. Even though it may say it isn't connected after the reboot, that may not be so. This router replaced the one from my cable company, so I set it up with the same SSID and password, so I had that defined in my devices already. It connected straight away, and selecting the router after it said it wasn't connected shows that, in fact, it was. I was up and running in short order.* Both the app and the configuration website are very usable with assistive technology. I am blind and use VoiceOver, a screen reader built into every Mac and iThing. While there were a couple of buttons with slightly odd labels, the app was intuitive, and I was able to use the website once I understood its layout. Hint: when you select an option to configure on the website, the configuration is in a frame at the end of the page.* It has external, adjustable antennas. Seven of them. So whichever way you have the router oriented, you can turn and point the antennas so that they are best oriented for your installation. The only thing I'd love to see would be for a future version to have the antennas removable, with RP-SMA connectors, so that they may be replaced with higher gain ones. Even so, these are plenty good enough.* Be aware that not all configuration options in the website are available on the iOS app. Some things, like port forwarding (this router calls them virtual servers), are not available on the app.A couple of things that I'd like to see done differently or finished:* There's an option on the configuration website for DDNS. However, selecting it does not bring up any DDNS configuration options. Sounds like they started to implement it but never finished.* You may not be able to modify DNS from the DHCP-provided ones from your ISP. I'm not sure about this yet. This shouldn't be an issue in most cases.* Port forwarding: you can't define a range of ports. For instance, I have an application that uses ports 5198-5200. Port 5200 forwards as TCP and UDP, but the others forward as UDP only. So, with this router, I need three forward definitions instead of two.* One thing I liked about my ISP provided router that I miss on this one: a handy table that shows each wireless device's signal strength in DBM. Admittedly, most people couldn't care less, and it's mostly just interesting, but this information may help with better antenna aiming.* bE aware that 802.11AC is only available on the 5 GHz network.* Finally, this router, in any device lists, does not show devices that have static IP addresses. While you can reserve IP's so that they are handed out to specific devices, if you have a device with a static IP definition, it will certainly connect just fine, but it doesn't show up as a connected device. I guess if you've defined it, you know it's there.I can't comment on the documentation, although I suspect it just covers the basics. The PDF is a graphic-only one so I was unable to read it. But the router was easy enough to set up and configure that I didn't really need any.The things that I'd like to see changed or improved are things that likely most people won't care about, or that most people will not have any use for. For $79, this is a very good deal.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE (04/06/21)I realized that there IS a web interface for the router. I made the mistake of trying to access it via a desktop rather than from the wireless (on the same IP subnet). And that web interface does contain many other options like changing the device into an AP, has more configurations for control, bandwidth and so on. So advanced users will be at home with this web interface.ORIGINAL ReviewPRO:Transmission power and multiple antennas allows for faster throughput. (see Pics)Configuration of the device is pretty straight forward through the App (Android App)LED control. Yes please. Not many brands have this. I do not want light at night.CONS:Not really a con, but I miss the web interface. Configuration needs to be done through the app and that is still good.(READ UPDATE: There is a web interface)A bit bulky compared with other devices. Antennas very prominent. I will be mounting mine on the wall, and it sticks a lot (however I prefer bulky and fast rather than slim and not so fast).I cannot tell much about the internal quality of components used on this device (i am not going to open it), but so far it is performing really well.Other comments:I have a 1Gb. Fiber Connection, and I since I work in IT, I normally stick to enterprise devices. But I was surprised that a cheaper device (although newer) could deliver a much faster speed than my older device.At the end of the day, all I care is about the speed available for all the devices at home (and since all the virtual learning for kids is still ongoing, this is something good to keep all Zoom/Webex/Teams meetings going).Using a Meraki:Cell: 115 Mbps - 91.1 MbpsLaptop: 227 Mbps - 180 MbpsUsing Speedefy:Cell: 499 Mbps - 137 MbpsLaptop: 404 Mbps - 194 MbpsBoth APs are in similar locations (although one mounted and the other one on my chair next to it)Quality wise looks ok, nothing too fancy, so I hope this device keeps this performance on the long run.Final thoughts:It does exactly what I expected (to get me better WIFI speed) and for less money than my other older device.While I do not have any source of noise, in the place where I live, we have our spectrum very crowded (I live in a DC), so this device was able to get a good frequency and broadcast at 2.4 and 5 Ghz without much interference. Be aware that most of my devices are connecting to the 5 GHz (where you would get the most speed).Very happy right now with the device. I will be doing an updated review probably 6 months into it to see if it still works as expected.",

My ONLY reason for 4/5 stars was because you apparently can't define it's IP address, it is what it is. My intent was to use this behind another router so that this device looks to the main router for its DHCP. Simply does not work, and yes, I have enabled that feature, rebooted, retried, etc. with no apparent effect. However it WORKS, and handles the connection without issues, so all is good. Just know that IF you have a complicated network, where the inability to assign/change this devices IP address is needed... not gonna work. \ud83d\ude09 (Companies with subnets, multiple routers, etc., might have issues with this.).",
