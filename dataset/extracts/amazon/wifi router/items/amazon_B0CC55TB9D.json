And the other one was not able to work too far away from my wireless router. I did some more research and came across this one and thought I would give it a try. The Reyee RG-REX12 worked with my SSID, and it worked about 50 feet away from the router, in the laundry room. It gave me between a 20 - 30% boost in signal strength (thats why I gave it three stars). I didn't expect 70%, but I was hoping for around 50%. I don't remember the actual numbers off the top of my head, but we have not had any slowdowns or buffering in the back of the house since I installed it.Thanks,Robert",

                "reviewText": "While this repeater showed up exactly when they said it would. That's the only thing good I have to say. Set-up was a pain. And it did absolutely no good at all. Can't even move it more than 20' from source. If you do it looses all signal. Kinda defeats the point of getting it. I would return it, but all packaging is trashed. Do yourself a favor and buy anything else but this.",
