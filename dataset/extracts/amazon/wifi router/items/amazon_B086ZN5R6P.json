                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Product with lots of potential, yet can be aggravating for the typical end-user",
                "reviewText": "I have been using this product for over six months, experiencing different results from time to time. I have seen it perform exceptionally well and total failure. The use of this product might depend upon the complexity of your network or what you intend to do with it. As a standalone, it probably functions pretty well for its intended purpose. Out of the box, the installation is fairly straightforward. If you have a smartphone, it will walk even the most non-tech savvy individual how to get it functioning. Advanced or power users such as myself, tend to see the setup as very vanilla or basic. One thing that should be highlighted bar none in the setup and is worthy to note is that each satellite will operate wirelessly independent of the router, however, it will operate exceptionally better if hardwired for ethernet backhaul. When I originally purchased this unit, the problems were fairly intense with disconnections almost all of the time. The satellites would not stay synced. I strongly considered returning the product and getting three independent routers to do the same thing. I read somewhere that there was going to be a firmware update that would correct these issues. Within thirty or so days, the firmware patch was released correcting the vast majority of issues. Over the course of six months, there have been a few updates, nothing as major as the first one. I did discover through experimenting, that while in the bedroom I could pull a max speed of 80mbps off a gig connection over wifi, but when I attached an ethernet cable to the back of the satellite from the router, the speed increased to 700mbps. In the manual, it will tell you that you can connect one satellite for wired ethernet backhaul. You can connect as many as you want, provided you use a network switch from the main router MR60 to the satellite's MS60s. In my particular setup, I needed coverage in my master bedroom and a playroom. Since both of these rooms are on the first floor and my main router (RAX120) is on the second floor, we had sporadic coverage at best. I have been utilizing the MR60 as a secondary router (by turning off the DHCP and statically assigning the MR60, MS60s their own ips) and sharing the same SSID and Password. This way the internet is fluid to work no matter what room I am in or what device I am on. These little units work well for the most part in this configuration, however, from time to time, the connection acts stagnant requiring a reboot. At times I can not access the MR60 page over wifi, but I can over ethernet. Sometimes it will go for months with no issue and other times it will just give issue after issue. In one of the latest firmware updates, they allow you to run the device as an access point, which is the proper way to do it, however, through further testing my connection speed drops by 25%, utilizing it this way versus using it as a secondary router. I would like to see the firmware steadily be improved for more reliability. My ratings are as follows, 4 stars over all for the product as it is not the worst and offers a lot for a package deal in comparison to much more expensive setups. 4 stars on the signal, when it works it works really good, when it doesn't it isn't good at all, improved firmware could make this even better. 3 stars on tech support, as I don't use tech support, most of the people don't speak well or listen to the problems the user is facing, partly because they simply do not know the product they are representing, 3 stars for the mobile app, it is good and looks appealing, however, I simply use the GUI because I can not access both the RAX120 and MR60 on the app at the same time and I don't use the app. The GUI is the only way to support both routers at the same time",

                "reviewText": "Heed the reviews. WiFi drops devices constantly. Zoom meetings disconnect. One spot in my home with full wifi signal strength will not connect to the internet- it seems the mesh routers can\u2019t decide which to use and give up. And, yes, I stayed on top of updates. During a firmware update, one of my satellites was bricked and totally unresponsive. Customer support is nonexistent to obtain a warranty repair. Tried to load the firmware directly to the satellite as some users suggested on forums but with no success. The steps seem outdated for windows 10. Tried the support website and could never figure out how to contact anyone. I\u2019ve read on forums that for have to pay $50 or whatever for phone tech support. I\u2019m well within the 1 year manufacturer warranty so why should I pay for support? I\u2019m out $275 and months of dealing with this nonsense. I ordered a different brand more pricey mesh system. We\u2019ll see how that goes\u2026Update: I\u2019m happy I tried another brand and forked up a little more money. I can\u2019t name them or Amazon will delete my review. But I can tell you that my SYStem stays LINKed to the internet. Range is better and the mobile app/setup is worlds better. So upset I lost almost $300 and months of my life with this Netgear junk. By the way, Betgear also charges to remotely access your router and you get an unusable scaled down bitdefender vpn as well as unreliable malicious website warnings with the service. I turned off all the \u201csafety features\u201d because they constantly blocked my email accounts on my iPhone as well as non-malicious website.",

                "reviewText": "Un gran producto. Lo compr\u00e9 principalmente porque la diferencia entre los Mbps que recib\u00eda en mi m\u00f3dem (cerca de 200 Mbps) y lo que llegaba en el resto del departamento (90 Mbps) hac\u00eda evidente el gran desperdicio de velocidad que pagaba respecto a la que experimentaba. Tambi\u00e9n ten\u00eda un \u00e1rea en la que se\u00f1al pr\u00e1cticamente no llegaba, a\u00fan con extensores Netgear Ac1200. Compr\u00e9 entonces un router Huawei Wifi 6 y la verdad bueno. Recib\u00eda casi los 200 Mbps pero a los 5 metros de nuevo se ca\u00eda la velocidad. Finalmente me decid\u00ed por estos Nighthawk, por ser de malla para cubrir m\u00e1s area, ser Wifi 6, estar a buen precio (cuando lo compr\u00e9, costaba 2 mil pesos m\u00e1s econ\u00f3mico que la versi\u00f3n Mk62 que s\u00f3lo trae dos equipos, este trae tres) y ser de marca Netgear que en el pasado me ha demostrado ser de calidad. El resultado fue muy bueno. Este sistema de malla me entrega ya 195 Mbps en cualquier lugar del depa y ya no hay zona sin se\u00f1al. El \u00fanico inconveniente para m\u00ed fue que, resulta que este sistema te deja ambas redes 2.4 y 5 en una misma, con el mismo nombre y clave y no es posible separarlas. Esto fue un problema puesto que estoy automatizando mi depa con muuuuchos smart swirches, smart plugs y smart lights, y dos Echo de Amazon (Alexa), pero varios dispositivos, sobre todo los smart plugs, s\u00f3lo funcionan con red 2.4. El resultado es que pocos plugs funcionaron. \u00bfQue tuve que hacer? Dejar todav\u00eda funcionando uno de mis extensores Netgear AC1200 a donde se conectaron todos mis dispositivos smart. La historia acab\u00f3 bien pero, \u00bfqu\u00e9 necedad de Netgear de no dar la opci\u00f3n de diferenciar ambas redes, como cualquier otro sistema?",
