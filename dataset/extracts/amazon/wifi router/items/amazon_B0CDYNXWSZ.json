The repeater is easy to set up; provides two additional wifi channels that one can connect to. However, several speed tests showed that the additional wifi channels were noticably slower than the main wifi channel even in the remote room. That is, I was better off just using my primary wifi channel. We don't have any significant need for additional wifi channels, what I was hoping for was that the repeater would provide a stronger signal in the remote room for downloads & uploads; it did not. So for my needs, this wasn't a good buy.",
