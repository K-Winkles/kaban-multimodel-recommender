                "reviewText": "I took a chance on this knowing it was a new product with no reviews. Our internet has been so hit or miss using the modem's built-in router, so was hopeful this would help.The router comes with almost no documentation. There is a card to tell you what the light indicates in various modes. The instruction is to download the app and follow the steps to set it up. This is a joke. The app makes you create an account, and then says to make sure your device (phone or router I don't know) is connected to the internet. It then says there is no connection. When I closed the app and reopened and tried to login to the account I just created, it gave an error that seemed to indicate that I didn't have an email address in the email field.The card also has a web address that it says to visit for more information. I tried this and the site has no mention of the router and only has information for a streaming box. Not helpful.Although I really didn't want to, I called the support number given. I was on hold for a few minutes, then it sounded like I was connected and I could hear some shuffling noises but no one talking. It finally disconnected on me. I called again and almost immediately was connected with a support rep. He helped me connect directly to the router and get into the setup. He was very patient while I had to search for the laptop that actually has an ethernet port and for another network cable. It didn't take too long to get through the setup and get it working. It would be nice though if there was information included to tell you how to do this.So far, so good. Did a speed test at fast.com and got better results than I ever had. It's actually test at or very close to the speed I'm paying for. If the app was actually usable, I could probably go to 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "Great router in terms of design and hardware. But just a word if you plan to install Open-Wrt.. Don't forget to follow the USB recovery part towards the end of the page. If you screw up, you can insert a usb with the proper file using the exact name in the line and it will restore the router's firmware on reboot or if you unplug and replug the thing. Once it is done restoring (router light is blue), take out the usb. Read the entire page very carefully to understand it.Secondly, try install the stable first. The stable comes with the open wrt UI (called luci) and the snapshot version does not so you have to manually install it. The open wrt page for the dynalink router does not mention that if you attempt to install the latest snapshot image, you will not be able to access the UI through the 192.168.1.1 IP address. You need to access SSH through something like Putty and manually install the luci UI using the command line : opkg update && opkg install luciPlus you need to have a live internet connection connect to the router's port to even use the above command line and install luci. If not you will have to manually download and put it on the router locally through something like winscp using the scp protocol and then use Putty/SSH terminal to install it manually. Just a heads up...",

                "reviewText": "This was the second unit shipped to me as a new replacement and it worked fine for a week or so. It connects to a T-Mobile gateway and I have super fast speeds 500-600 Mbs because I live close to the tower. Then I noticed the the internet speed slowed down considerably and it was not the T-Mobile gateway, it was the Dynalink. So I called customer service and created a case. I was told this was a known issue. Bottom line nothing was done, no call backs - slow service.So I keep it and then 8 months later it go into a constant reboot cycle - broken. So I call Dynalink Customer Service twice and no progress even though I was asked to make an email complaint with all the info. So on a third call I get someone based in the US who processed the case himself after he recognized it was a bad unit. Everyone I spoke with were very polite, respectful and made me think something would happen - but nothing happed until I got the person based in the US. I was asked to send the unit back at my expense ($25).I sent the info the US based person gave me on the RMA return, case number, etc. in an email and I requested to be sent a new router and not a refurbished or used one. I feel like that was a fair and reasonable request due to the fact this router never worked right from the beginning. Even the US based person thought this was a fair request.So after dealing with this over a month (34 days) I received a replacement that was an open box router with obvious signs of use and handling. Even the box it came in was crushed and there was no damage on the outer box. I am unhappy at receiving something that is not new and feel Dynalink needs to improve customer service. I cannot recommend their products at this time and sincerely hope they improve and respond to customers with better actions.",
