I'm using with the Verizon 5G wireless router box and had to change the Verizon router settings to act as a passthrough (see Youtube video on how to set up) to avoid conflicting with the Google Nest router. The dead spots and weak signal in my two story home are no longer an issue and the Wifi is lightning fast throughout. In addition, the Google Home app is extremely easy to use. Highly recommend!!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The improvement is not where you think it is. Totally worth, so simple!",
                "reviewText": "Tips:1- Do not be affraid of installation, it was very simple.The routers and the points -or 2 routers in this case- create a mesh by themselves wihtout any user intervention.The app guides you through the process. As a tech guy, this was so easy I feel guilty :p2- This mesh will improve your WiFi speed across the house for any internet service up to about 600-700 Mbps, I daresay. WiFi has its limitations, anything above that is wishfull thinking due to the harware constraints of our current phones and devices. But... the real improvement is not the \"speed\" itself (read below).3- This is the 2 router pack, not the classsic \"router\" and \"point/Google assistant\" pack. I chose this one expressly since the routers have ethernet LAN RJ45 jacks (ports), which the \"points\" lack, because my house is already wired with LAN ethernet cable and I already have plenty of \"hey google\" things around =)Note: you will need proper harware to get anything above 50 Mbps, e.g.: Cat. 5e or Cat. 6 cable , and if you use an ethernet switch make sure it is Gigabit compliant, otherwise stick to the standasrd WiFi mesh, you'll be surprised: this WiFi mesh will be faster than a 10/100 cable or a \"Fast Ethernet\" switch.4- It is fast, indeed, but take note: since the mesh talks in both directions, there will be a natural minimal speed loss when connected to a \"point\" (or the secondary \"router\" in this case). E.g.: when the mesh is connected wirelessly (pure WiFi mesh), I get 100 Mbps near the router and 50-70 Mbps near the \"point\"; but when wired (ethernet backhaul between the 2 routers) I get 80-100 Mbps near the \"point\". I think this is expected, completely normal due to the 2-way wireless communication between both mesh devices.5- My ISP installed a coaxial Modem/Router combo unit in my house, I was affraid of the dared double-NAT menace, but to my relief they got allong surprisingly well.Actually, I kept my original WiFi network and the new nest mesh network up simultaneously for a couple days, while migrating everything (the easy and recommended way would have been to disable the old WiFi network and use the same SSID name and password on the new one, but I wanted to experiment a little).Anyhow, although they seemed to work fine together, I decided to turn off the ISP Modem/Router's WiFi radios to avoid any possible interference. WiFi can be grumpy when crowded.6- I chose the newest \"Nest\" WiFi mesh routers over the previous \"Google\" WiFi mesh or the Nest points because they have: a) faster WiFi conection (AC2200 vs AC1200), b) bigger area coverage (205 m2 vs 140 m2), c) more antennas (4x4 vs 2x2) and d) the capability of transmitting data to multiple devices simultaneously (MU-MIMO vs no-nothing). THIS is paramount. The improvement is noticeable when the kids are watching video streams and playing games while I hold to that important zoom meeting.(Note: The Nest points do have MU-MIMO, too, but lack the extra speed and extra coverage of the Nest routers. In exchange, they double as Google assistant speakers, so choose your potion)7- Get both apps, Google Home and Google Wifi. They seem to be migrating everything from Google WiFi to Google Home, but meantine get both! Google WiFi gives some extra options such as a speed test of all connected devices or information about the connection type between points, wired or wireless.In conclusion, the real \"speed\", the improvement over a standard WiFi network is not measured in Mbps by Speedtest, it's not even the extended coverage or the transparent, automatic handling of WIFi when moving around the house without hiccups nor the beamforming technology which sends the WiFi signal straight toyour device: it's how it handles devices and distributes bandwidth, making each device in my house faster individually, all at the same time, keeping my data transmission speedy and steady when the kids are squeezing the WiFi signal and my internet bandwidth.The only thing I would have wished for is WiFi 6 support (future proof). Otherwise well done, Google. I'm impressed. I have spoken.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Very good mesh, with one big weakness -backhaul",
                "reviewText": "This *router* 2-pack from Amazon is an Amazon exclusive offering not available through Google direct or other retailers. The 2-packs sold elsewhere are 1 router unit and 1 \u201cpoint\u201d unit. As a mesh wireless system, Nest Wifi can use a combination of router units and point unit but only Amazon sells this 2-router configuration.This is important because the Nest Wifi router units and point units do not have the same wireless specs. The router is an AC2200 4x4 setup while the point is an AC1200 2x2 setup. For those looking for the fastest *wireless* configuration (regardless of the smart speaker incorporation in the point) this Amazon 2-router pack provides the fastest wireless configuration available with the Nest Wifi.My home internet connection is gigabit fiber which provides more bandwidth than AC-generation Wifi systems can push in real-world use. Since they can\u2019t max out the connection, I can easily see the difference between different setups. I currently use the Netgear Orbi RBK50 mesh system and have been pretty happy with it, but I wanted to see if this new Nest Wifi mesh could outperform it.I have a long rectangular house with the modem and primary router in the front third and the satellite in the back third. There are four walls between router and satellite. The Netgear Orbi system\u2019s big selling point is that it has a 4-stream dedicated 5GHz backhaul that helps ensure that the bandwidth available to the satellite is as close as possible to the bandwidth available at the primary router. This design works *incredibly* well, especially when you have multiple walls in between units like I do.And this is where the Nest Wifi falls short. Each router unit by itself is actually very impressive. Very good range and performance that actually beats the Netgear Orbi at close-to-medium ranges. However, the link between units is its weakness. Google says that it uses smart tuning of the 4x4 antenna arrays to maintain the fastest connection between router and satellite units, but in real-world use it cannot compete with the Orbi\u2019s dedicated backhaul. Speedtests run on the Nest Wifi satellite gave me roughly 120Mbps down, whereas I got 250+Mbps down on the Orbi satellite.Nest Wifi *does* support wired backhaul between two router units so if you\u2019re fortunate to live in a home where you can run ethernet between the two units then this is an amazing setup and *highly recommended*. I\u2019d even recommend it above the Orbi if you can wire backhaul. Unfortunately I don\u2019t have this option so this was the deal-breaker for me.Pros:Elegant, compact design that fits in anywhere in the house*Super* simple setup with the Google Home app, just be patient as it goes through its configurationsExcellent performance from the individual router units themselvesAutomatic firmware updates done right. Everything just works.You can absolutely setup this 2-router configuration the same way as a router + point setup. Some below have suggested that it requires both units to be ethernet connected during setup but this is not the caseCons:No dedicated backhaul. Slower satellite performance as a result. Still good, but not as good as competing dedicated backhaul designsAll configurations are done through the Google Home smartphone app. Folks with more experience tweaking options in the router\u2019s web Admin Console may find this limiting.",

(Speed tests in main level were much higher, at 2 to 4 times better than before) and I added a second nest on the main floor to boost the signal upstairs. That signal strength went from pretty low (with a different wifi extender) to very similar speeds the main floor was seeing.So far worth the money as a relatively cost effective solution to poor wifi from the internet provider router.",
