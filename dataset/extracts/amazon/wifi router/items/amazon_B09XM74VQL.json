                "reviewText": "This review is for the OUTDOOR model of the EAP610 access point from TP-Link...After running for a day, this outdoor AP is outstanding. Provides excellent range especially for 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz signals. Easily managed through TPL's Omada Controller, which is what I recommend for managing your TPL devices since it's cloud-based and has a modern user interface. The AP is IP67 waterproof rated, so it should withstand harsh outdoor environments. The newest firmware for this device is v1.0.6 as of this review - the EAP must be set up to be managed by the Omada Controller (v5.7.4) to get the firmware update. Noticed that other reviewers complained about lack of firmware, they are available (and easier to find and install) from TP-Link's Omada Cloud UI.I set this device up by driving a 1.5 inch diameter PVC pipe into the ground near the back of my house, for outdoor installation. I ran a Cat6 patch cable directly to the AP from a PoE+ switch located in the basement. The cable was routed through the inside of the PVC pipe, and out through the top. I used the included zip ties to attach the AP to the PVC pipe. I've attached a photo to show the device installed onto the PVC pipe. If you have a nearby tree or a wall surface, you can easily mount the AP using the included bracket. The area where the cable attaches is waterproof, covered by a clever cap that screws into the bottom of the AP. Washers and everything you need to mount the AP is included in the box.If you don't have a PoE+ capable switch, not a big deal...the EAP610 INCLUDES a PoE+ injector which is very nice if you don't have a PoE+ capable switch already installed. PoE+ injectors generally cost at least $25-$40 depending on which brand you buy. This was a nice bonus even though I don't remember it being mentioned as included on the product page. The only cable you need to run to the device is a Cat5e/6/7 patch cable, whether you use the included injector or a PoE+ switch.So how's the range? This is where the EAP610 Outdoor model shines. Easily transmits 2.4Ghz, usable signal, beyond 450 ft. 5Ghz is fairly strong as far out as 100 ft if there are no walls or obstructions between the AP and your wifi client device. I have a few solar-powered cameras in my backyard to monitor a chicken coop and rabbit pen, those cameras get 90% or better 2.4Ghz signal and they're easily 150 ft away from the EAP610.I've bonded smart bulbs, wifi cameras, phones, and streaming devices to the EAP610 and they latched on without issues. After running this device for 24 hours, there have been no drops, no loss of signal. This AP seems quite reliable outdoors. Time will tell as I live in a cold Western NY climate where wind and snow storms are quite common. We shall see how it holds up over time. At the $130 price point, this device is priced better than most of the competitor brands out there. Definitely recommend this EAP610 for oudoor wifi use especially if you live on a large property of over an acre.",

                "reviewText": "We pretty much used this as a Wi-Fi extender. It was extremely easy to set up and mount. It extended our Wi-Fi where we wanted it to and then some. Even though it is placed outside on the back of our house, we are able to get Wi-Fi throughout the rest of our house which we were not before. So we had no need to buy a mesh system on top of it. Definitely recommend.",
