                "reviewText": "New update01-02-2018Router is working flawlessly. Running all three Ps4's at once networking online gaming while other's are using the WIFI for internet. Only time bandwidth had suffered was when internet speeds dropped in the evening which is nothing new. Haven't used the game boost at all and haven't had to. Upgraded to Cat6 ethernet cables from the modem to the router and from the router to the wired Ps4. Slight increase in download speeds but nothing huge although that wad expected. I have done NO adjusting to the settings and it's running on defaults with no problems at all. Absolutely worth every pennyUpdate...In case anyone is wondering, I have the Arris Surfboard 6141 Modem. I also have TWC 200Mbps internet. So there's a baseline for what I've got on tap.For the Router---I find the signal quality of the 5ghz channels to be more temper mental. I don't have a huge Townhouse but my daughter's room, which is the farthest point from the router, struggled at first with the signal. I should note a few things though. I had the router tucked way back on the bottom shelf of my entertainment center, in a corner of the living room, under the TV, PS4, all the wires etc. ALSO, my Townhouse has an older style heating system where the ceilings have heating elements so that probably hurts the signal as well. The 2.5ghz channel has been wide open, but the 5ghz channels were very difficult to hold in her room. I moved the router forward on the bottom shelf, still under the T.V. and PS4 but more clearance, and it made a huge difference. I get 90-120 mbps download speed in her room now on the 5ghz channel. I get full bars everywhere in the Townhouse now and my internet speed is ridiculous. So just something to think about when you set it up, positioning is important for the 5ghz channels.The mobile app is great. It lets you turn each channel on or off individually and also lets you schedule a time when a connected device can be blocked. So I can automatically block my kids' devices at a certain time every night or I can just turn all the WIFI off without turning off the router. There are all sorts of monitors in the app that let you watch how much bandwidth is being used in case you need to limit the bandwidth for certain devices. You can limit the bandwidth for every device as well in the app. The App also lets you monitor the RAM and CPU load. You can also set up a VPN in the app and set up/ use the WTFast feature. All in all the App is great and it makes the router very easy to manage.All in All the router is probably overkill for what I need now and will need for years, but it's definitely given me more access to the internet I've been paying for. Whereas I was struggling to connect everyone before, I've got tons on internet left over even with everyone connected. I wasn't expecting it to make that much of a difference but it did.I will Update again after Christmas when I've got both PS4's networked through the router and they are gaming with all the other electronics going at once.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I am not a huge tech guru by any means but I have to say this thing so far has been amazing. I have 9 people in my house using the internet. I don't have cable or satellite so everything gets streamed through the router. I moved from an ASUS dual band 2.5ghz router to this so yeah, it's a big step up. So here's what I've noticed so far.Set up was very easy with only one hickup where the instructions told me to log in with ADMIN ADMIN in the initial set-up screen and that was not needed. After that I just set up the three channels with passwords and it was good to go. The antennas do work as advertised. I initially left them pointing straight up and my daughter's Roku was barely picking up. I turned two antennas toward her room and now her Roku doesn't even buffer when she turns a movie on, it just starts immediately. Not only that but she's actually getting the full 1080p that she's never gotten before. Furthermore, I've connected everyone to the 2.5g channel and it is working perfect. At one time I had 7 clients connected and no hickups whatsoever. Also, when I connect my phone to the WIFI on the 5g channel and do a speed test it usually reaches 220Mbps download by the time the test ends and the speed is still climbing. I downloaded a 60mb app to my phone to test it and it downloaded almost instantly. I will soon have three PS4s, tablets, phones etc all running on it and I have to say I feel like it's gonna be great. It may be overkill and it's damn huge ( almost the size of a PS4 slim) but I'm finally taking advantage of the internet I've been paying for. I think that's worth a one time purchase of 300 dollars.",

                "reviewText": "Was a little apprehensive spending this much on a home router, but our previous well-rated TP Link product was struggling to handle our 17-device household and my son was complaining about Xbox lag. Looked at this, some of the less expensive ASUS and Netgear kit, and the more expensive gaming version of this product. Settled on this and glad we did.Out of box experience was so-so -- nice packaging, feels like a quality product, but physical assembly and initial setup took some time. The icons around the indicator lights are really small, and the antennas took some time to get seated properly. Bootup took a few minutes to correctly set up and talk to my in-house cable modem. So that all was a bit frustrating. But once it made its basic WAN connections, the features of this router really shined.Range - outstanding. We had a hardwired access point elsewhere in our large, old-construction home due to distance and interference issues with the home. I've turned off the AP because this router powers through bricks and concrete for at least 150 foot range. It does support ASUS' new AIMesh protocol so you can use an older ASUS router as an AP and it self-configures. Nifty idea, and one reason we picked this router, but turns out we don't need it.SmartConnect - this is a tri-band router with one 2.4GHz and two 5GHz channels. It can be set up as three independent networks or you can \"automatically combine\" either all three or just the 5GHz channels. The router then moves traffic across the radios as needed for bandwidth. We have some legacy 802.11a/b equipment in the house so set the 2.4 up for that and SmartConnect for the 5GHz. Seems to work very well. Handles 3 1080p video streams and Xbox traffic simultaneously with no problems whatsoever.Configurability - ASUS tends to write great router software that is highly flexible. Simple example: setting up a DMZ for the Xbox, I needed to designate a static IP address for the Xbox. Doing this while the kids were asleep, the Xbox was not on. No matter, the DHCP routing table has a \"offline devices\" menu to pick the old Xbox MAC address off the history to designate for static IP. There's a ton of little features like that that make this router a pleasure to work with for technically proficient users. The diagnostic tools are outstanding, with very detailed network analysis and monitoring available. It is a lot like Adobe Professional vs.. MS Paint. You can do a lot with this router -- VPN Client support, selective IP parental controls, remote admin, iOS admin app -- but it's got a lot of controls that are well-organized for the tech admin but confusing to a newbie just looking for the WPS button.Speed - been noticeably faster than our previous 802.11ac compatible equipment. Xbox loads updates faster, AppleTV movies start with less than a second lag, backup jobs run quickly. It has only been a week so far but rock solid stability along with that speed.Gaming - it is advertised as having access to the WTFast network. This is a specialist use case, we found, as that network only supports a handful of gaming game/console combinations so far, mostly adult combat games like Battlefront. No Fortnite console support, which made it a non-starter in our house.We looked at the gaming version of this router. It has more internal memory and a little more speed, but it was significantly more expensive. We decided this would likely be fine for our household, and that has been the case. Very high-end professional gamers might benefit from the upgrade to the ROG version, but I think most regular families will be fine with this.",

                "reviewText": "After having issues with seriously slow internet in certain parts of my home, mainly the PS5 in the basement, I was tired of hearing my teenager complain about lagging and slow internet. So I thought I\u2019d do some research and start by replacing my old cheap Router with thisASUS 5300. Wow! I\u2019m not technically savvy and didn\u2019t realize what a HUGE difference a quality Router could make. Installation and setup was a breeze. App is awesome and straightforward. Best, best purchase I ever made. My teen hasn\u2019t complained about lagging ONE Time since purchasing this router over a year ago! Highly recommend!UPDATE: So I purchased this router approximately in January 2021. It\u2019s now November 2023, so almost 2 years later, and this router is STILL going strong. I\u2019ve yet to have ANY issues, besides the powered lights no longer working, but doesn\u2019t affect its performance. Still probably the best purchase for internet I\u2019ve ever made. Still working as good as the day I set it up. My next router purchase, whenever I need one, will definitely be another ASUS. Fingers crossed I get many more years out of this one first ;)",

                "reviewText": "Tratar\u00e9 de hacer mi review lo mas corta y especifica posible...De Noviembre 2018 a Mayo 2019 pase por 4 routers antes que este, y hasta hoy este ha funcionado a la perfecci\u00f3n, pero he aprendido en base a los otros 4, la historia a continuaci\u00f3n...1. Noviembre 2018: Compr\u00e9 el Asus RT-AC88U, funcion\u00f3 1 d\u00eda, hubo un corte de luz como de 5 minutos y cuando volvi\u00f3 el router ya no funcionaba.2.- Enero 2019: Mismo Asus RT-AC88U, funciono bien 1 mes en amabas redes las 2.4 y la 5GHz, al mes dejo de funcionar la 5GHz pero como seguia funcionando la 2.4 me lo quede como hasta Abril donde comenc\u00e9 a presentar problemas de que mis dispositivos batallaban para conectarse a esta red y ten\u00eda que estar reseteando el router o apagarlo y volver a encender.3.- Abril 2019: TP-LINK Archer C3200, funciono bien pero su rango de se\u00f1al era igual al del modem/router proporcionado por mi proveedora del servicio de internet (Megacable) y rendimiento menor al de los Asus que ya estaba acostumbrado.4.- Abril 2019: LinkSyS AC3200 (WRT32XB): Rango de se\u00f1al muy d\u00e9bil y velocidad en la transmisi\u00f3n de datos menor al de los Asus del cual ya estaba acostumbrado5.- Mayo 2019: ASUS RT-AC5300: Hasta hoy el router mas caro que he comprado y en base a lo que me hab\u00eda pasado con los anteriores ten\u00eda que prevenir...Lo bueno:- La transmisi\u00f3n de datos es rapid\u00edsima no importa si estoy viendo stories en instagram, videos en youtube, peliculas en netflix todo lo carga en menos de 1 segundo.- Tengo 3 redes disponibles para balancear la carga de todos los dispositivos conectados- Su espectro de red es amplio aunque todo depende del lugar donde este, en mi situaci\u00f3n y para que tengan un poco mas de perspectiva el router da servicio a 3 casas todas construidas en concreto y con multiples divisiones de concreto, el router se encuentra ubicado en una segunda planta de la casa 3, en el supuesto de que la casa 1 es la de la izquierda, la 2 es la de en medio y la 3 es la de la derecha, cada una aprox tiene 5 metros de frente por algunos 30 metros de fondo y a todas nos alcanza a dar servicio, el espectro podr\u00eda ser mayor pero por tantos muros la se\u00f1al comienza a debilitarse.- Aprox tenemos 3 smart tv, 4 computadoras, y 5 celulares conectados a la red y aun asi todo este funcionando a la vez no he notado alguna disminuci\u00f3n en la transmisi\u00f3n aunque todo esta separado en redes para su mejor funcionamiento, osea algunos aparatos estan en la red 2.4 otros en la 5G1 y los demas en la 5G2.RECOMENDACI\u00d3N en base a la experiencia...Despu\u00e9s de los acontencimientos que me pas\u00f3 con los otros routers, lo que aconsejo para que protejas tu router y mas que nada tu inversi\u00f3n por que es una lana, es que ademas del router compres un No break para que en caso de que se vaya la luz o algo puedas apagar el router sin arriesgar a que se da\u00f1e ya que la bateria del no break dependiendo lo que tengas conectado te dar\u00e1 desde 5 a 30 minutos mas de energ\u00eda, y por lo mismo de que es un router y esta trabajando 24/7 se calienta mucho tambi\u00e9n esto puede hacer que se descomponga porque maneja componente electr\u00f3nicos tan peque\u00f1os que expuestos a gran cantidad de calor pueden descomponerse entonces para esto compra tambi\u00e9n una de estas base con ventilador como para una laptop y d\u00e9jasela conectada permanentemente al router para evitar el exceso de calor, as\u00ed que para que est\u00e9s protegido si necesitaras adicional al precio del router una inversi\u00f3n mas de aprox 2 mil pesos pero cr\u00e9eme vale completamente la pena.",

But some how the hardware is a failure at its very basic levels. I got mine and it stopped working just after two hours of good run. No updates were install I was running on original firmware it came with. All of sudden the router stopped transmitting wifi and even LAN support. I was certain at this point it's some software glitch. I immediately tried it firmware rescue program but found later that there is some manufacturing defect with mine. The unit is sent back to the seller for replacement as of now I hope I get a replacement and it doesn't have any issues like this one. Besides this the router has almost zero latency and has excellent coverage even in cemented wall house.I did get the replacement. And it's working awesome.I'm so happy with this router that I m writing additional details about this router.U have to read through the manual for the list of extensive features available. Example dlna sever via USB drive. Which is extremely easy to do.Normal network problems are history with this router.This is the way to setup an ideal home and business wifi network. Extremely happy with the replacement product",

The power and stability of its tri-band signals, as well as the automatic channel detection and change features to avoid collisions with neighboring routers, guarantee that there will never be interruptions due to this cause, which is very frequent in the vicinity of apartment buildings. In this way it is possible to have stable and continuous videoconferences and online games. Additionally, the USB ports allow the connection of a disk tower where I have the services, information and critical applications of my activity, in this way I manage to have an appropriate intrinsic safety backup through a disk array installation, which ensures an appropriate backup for all the needs of my home users, which means I don't pay for any cloud backup services. When we talk about seven users at home, it is quite a lot of money. The router allows efficient and fluid communication throughout the home network, both wired and Wi-Fi, as well as full control of the network and its use through powerful administration tools. Due to the complexity of the model, it is understood that a reboot should take more time than other simpler ones, but this has been necessary only a couple of times in these two years and only to rule out failures. It is a solid and effective device, it is not cheap in its purchase value, but it is worth it by being able to have services that with other past models would have been impossible.",
