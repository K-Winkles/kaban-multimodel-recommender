I can get over 900mbps on Speedtest throughout the house on 6ghz WiFi connected to an iPhone 15 pro.I had read a review that said it wasn\u2019t faster but these results are amazing. My xfinity router maxed out at 600 on 5ghz. I tried an asus with some QoS enabled and only achieved 250.I can\u2019t tell how well it prioritized traffic. When doing some super fast downloads maxing out my gigabit internet service and wifi, ping times in league of legends can rise from 55ms to 500ms.Silly limitation. The WAN port is only gigabit Ethernet. So it\u2019s not possible to get more than 1000mbps even though WiFi 6e should be able to do it. Many other WiFi 6e routers do have higher speed wan port.But other than that I\u2019m super happy with it so far. Far exceeds my expectations.",

                "reviewText": "I selected this router because it is the latest technology of tri-band and it's powerful CPU, but more importantly it's coverage area of 3,000 sq. ft. I replaced a Netgear R7300 DST Router in the same 2,000 sq ft home that the new Tenda covers. With the Netgear I had areas of the home where the Wi-Fi signal was very weak. In order to compinsate I used Netgear Add-on DST Adapter to boost the Wi-Fi signal and each Adapter had it's own available wi-fi login. The adapters ran warm to the touch and would occasionally fail. What a pain to keep the home covered . The Tenda is a dream very fast and the coverage is great; one router for the entire home.",

                "reviewText": "I wish it were more reliable because I liked it otherwise: The setup was quick and easy (I was able to configure it locally via the web interface over wifi using the default passcode on the bottom), and when it worked the speed and range were great. No cloud account required or other such nonsense. The web interface is simple and clean, and it's easy to see what clients are connected and at what speed. Pretty much exactly what I wanted. If only it were reliable...The first clue to a problem was that, like many other (equally flaky) routers out there, it has an option to auto-reboot itself every day, which is on by default. I run many home automation devices on my network, so this is annoying, but I went ahead and left it on since I figured better down a minute a day than crashing entirely.But even with that on, on day two or three a subset of my devices all dropped out. I traced it back to DHCP \"offer\" packets getting dropped by the Tenda. Power-cycling the Tenda by hand (unplug, wait, re-plug) fixed the problem and most (but not all!) of those devices came back online. Some devices (including my laptop, which I have traveled the world with and never had a wifi problem with before) still could not get the DHCP offer packet, and so never made it back onto the network.That said: I am using it in AP mode (direct replacement for an older router in exactly the same config--I've reverted back to that older router for now and everything is fine again), and obviously relying on DHCP (from my main router/firewall) so it's possible if either of those don't apply to you it will work fine. (I assume it must, since many people like this router).During the first 24-36 hours, every device in my house (including laptop) was connected and working, and it was great. So sad it didn't stay that way. Maybe I'll try again in a year and see if they've worked out the bugs. (I did check that it was running the latest firmware.)I tried emailing their support addy and got a bounce that said their quota was full...",

Sobre todo me gusto mucho el DDNS, ahora no necesito una IP p\u00fablica para mi sitio web ya que el router se encarga automaticamente de actualizar la vincunlaci\u00f3n de mi dominio con mi IP dinamica, es fantastico!. Tambien me gusto mucho la aplicaci\u00f3n para la administraci\u00f3n remota del router, yo vincule mi cuenta de google y me ha funcionado de maravilla, estoy sumamente facinado con lo bien que funciona esta aplicaci\u00f3n.En la opci\u00f3n de Configuraci\u00f3n de LAN \\ Lista de reserva de IP est\u00e1tica, adicione casi 30 dispositivos y siempre estan conectados, no hay intermitencia lo cual es genial para la domotica de mi casa. No tengo ningun problema todos mis dispositivos IoT funcionan perfectamente bien.En resumen todas las caracter\u00edsticas del router funcionan muy bien, su interfaz es sencilla, practica y muy completa. Lo \u00fanico que encontre en contra fue un problema de mucha latencia de subida ( Upload_Latency ) que sucede cuando se activa la opci\u00f3n de IPv6. Sin embargo, al desactivar esta opci\u00f3n esa latencia se va! y el router se vulve super veloz.",
