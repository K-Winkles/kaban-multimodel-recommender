I don't know anything about speeds, but I'm pretty sure it's at leas as good if not better than my 12 yr old router. That's the good news. I'm only mildly tech savvy. I have set up a router before, 12 years ago. The instructions that come with it are a only little helpful if you don't know what you're doing. If you only need basic internet routing to laptops, tv, and other basic home devices the instructions can be confusing because they have a lot of information you don't need, At least I'm assuming I don't need it because I didn't understand it all and it works when I just followed the part that says router mode. (If you know what LAN and WAN and PPPoE are then you know more than me and should understand the instructions.)BUT and here's where a star comes off, maybe 1 1/2 stars. There is a code to scan and a web address that take you to an error page. So there are no further or simpler instructions online. I couldn't find this model on the Wavlink website or any other user manual.Ok you have it plugged in to electric outlet and to the modem or your satellite connection. Now this id the part the instructions don't really tell you. Your computer should recognize the connection and you can type 192.168.10.1 in the address bar and get to the set up page for Wavlink. Explore around this page and you can set passwords, name your connection, those are the basic settings you will use.In my experience using a number of devices and apps, developers think everybody thinks like they do, understands confusing technical instructions, and knows how to use these things. My best advice is to get a 12 year old to help you, (LOL)",

This is not straightforward. This is was my process.Go into the settings be directed to the website. There you have to search for your product, it'll tell you the product name on the bottom of your router however the website won't recognise the product name on the bottom of the router you will have to Google the product name.Now you've got the correct name so you can go back to the website to download the update file.Not all browsers support the website so the download link might be hidden. On Chrome mobile it was hidden on Chrome desktop I could find it.Download it. Log back into the router. Click on update, find file and apply.Now it works fine, not flawless but totally acceptable for the price.PS before I discovered that I could download the file myself by using desktop view on my phone browser I emailed them and they emailed me the file I needed but by then I had already updated it.
