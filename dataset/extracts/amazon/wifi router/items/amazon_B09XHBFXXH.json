While I get coverage throughout the house, my desktop with its antenna near the outside wall of the house had weak signal and would occasionally lag in games (or even disconnect on rare occasions).Today before replacing my stock motherboard antennas with this one, I ran the following from cmd command line: netsh wlan show interfacesIt showed signal strength of 72%After replacing with this antenna, I am seeing 99% (and faster transmit/receive speed by about 40%)Positioning of the moving parts is important, as depending on how I position them I can get worse signal then before, same, slightly better or the near perfect one. What works best for me is both of them straight up.The magnet felt kind of weak on a nearby metal item I had but feels very strong on my PC case.I would recommend based on my experience (and will update after I use it for longer if that changes).",

                "reviewText": "At 2AM one day, I managed to break the original WIFI antenna for a Asus ROG Strix z790E motherboard. While I was able to re-solder the connectors (using a microscope and a very fine soldering tip), the original design is much too fragile and the cable too short.The Eightwood seems to be bit more robust and works at least as well as the original -- in fact, it seems to be better as it gives rx/tx speeds of 866/866 (Mbps) very reliably. No doubt this is partly because it has a longer cable which allows better positioning options. It may also be on account of having two antennae. If nothing else having the longer cable diminishes the likelihood of stressing the connectors to failure.I am replacing all of the antennae on all my systems.It's good, buy it.",
