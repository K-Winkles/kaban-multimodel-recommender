We plugged in the extender in the corner of the living room between the Wi-Fi, that is in our office, and our shed that is at least 70ft. from where the extender is located. We were able to watch Thursday Night Football on Prime with ease and full bars of Wi-Fi. I highly recommend this product to anyone!!!",

But it is exactly what I needed. Half our house can\u2019t pick up Wi-Fi because the router is too far away. Now I have Wi-Fi that never kicks me off in about another 1800 square feet area. It is awesome! All I did is follow the easy steps they sent and it is working. No complicated stuff. It allows you to give this area Wi-Fi a new name but keep the original password. It has been working for a couple of weeks. I am happy!",

We used it to connect to a remote camera we installed in our outdoor aviary approximately 35 feet away from the house (and the wall the extender is plugged into). The main router was too far away to reach the camera but the WiFi extender did the trick. The camera picture clarity is excellent and there is essentially no lag time.",
