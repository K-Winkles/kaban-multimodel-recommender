                "reviewText": "We have lived in my house for over 10 years. It\u2019s an older house built in the 60s, There are 6 of us in the house 4 adults, one 13y and one 7y. We have 3 ring devices, 4 Alexa\u2019s, 6 fire sticks, 6 computers, 6 gaming consoles, a generator, and we all have iPads, cell phones etc, so there are a lot of devices connected to our wifi, so we\u2019ve never had great luck with the range or performance of our internet signal. Things would buffer alot or we\u2019d have dropped signals, so I was always restarting the router. We use to have Brighthouse but currently have Spectrum with just internet, We upgraded our internet to 1GB over a year ago and was given a dual band wifi 5 router that never really worked for us perfectly, I believe it was because it couldn\u2019t support 1GB, but didn\u2019t know that until I got this router. We were using an extender so we could connect to our generator and ring camera that was located outside, and just so you can have an idea, on our generator the wifi signal was at 2%, which was fine but if we wanted to connect anything else outside it was almost impossible. So we contacted customer support about the issues we were having, and they sent us there newest router the wifi 6e router, mind you we were still using the extender. It worked good for a couple days then it stopped. A lot of buffering and a lot of devices wouldn\u2019t even connect to it like my Oculus Quest 2, my husbands work computer and more! I couldn\u2019t even connect our ring camera outback, and the generator outside was getting 0%-1% signal, so the signal would drop a lot. I figured it was because a lot of things still aren\u2019t compatible with wifi 6. So we called support again they did manage to get everything working for about 5 days, then it would stop again. So we called support for the last time and they told us to try to buy a router ourselves. So I happened to come across this one. I was pretty skeptical, thinking it may work as well as the dual band one we had only maybe a little better. The setup process was so easy! Didn\u2019t have to call Spectrum at all! I do wish that the parental controls, security+ and, QoS was free. But they do give you a free month with any of them. So I did the security+. The app you use with it is great! There are a lot of tools in the settings. You can have it auto connect to a network or set it up separately so you can choose 2.4, 5 or 6G, which is what I did. You can have a guest network, optimize your network performance and a lot more! Everything connected perfectly with excellent signal! So I figured I would try to connect the generator and ring camera outback without the extender just for kicks, since I was feeling optimistic\ud83d\ude0e The ring camera connected perfectly with excellent signal! Now was the most important test, the generator\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab Connected it for the first time and I see 22% signal!!! I was SOOO excited! Then I went to the farthest part of my backyard with my cell phone where Iv never had wifi signal before and I had 3-4 bars of wifi signal!!! I couldn\u2019t believe it! This thing has GREAT range, GREAT performance, and is easy to set up and use, what else could you want! It\u2019s been a couple weeks now, no buffering! and everything works flawlessly! I couldn\u2019t be happier! No one complaining for me to fix the wifi anymore and no restarting it twice a week! I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has horrible or just ok wifi signal. The only flaw I can say about it is needing a subscription for the extras. Otherwise just go for it! You don\u2019t like it just return it.",

                "reviewText": "This router is replacing a network provider router they installed. This router was very easy to install using the TPlink Tether app. Was up and running in 15 minutes. Used the tether app to do some advanced changes to match my networks needs. I will update later. This modem is definitely faster because of its superior processor and internal throughput.Update 1: have been using this router now for a while and by far the best WiFi router I have ever owned and used. The Tether app is great, not perfect but has been instrumental in the great operation of my network. Just upgraded my extender to RE815XE which has matching features including the addition of the 6G band. I have iPhone 15 Pro\u2019s and the new band works well and the TP-LINK Mesh network is working very well. Best WiFi net I have ever had.",

                "reviewText": "I paid a tech friend to set this up, but pretty sure even I could have done it, but didn't want any issues since it was at the daughter's house and I don't have a good phone connection there. He did a web-based install vs using the app at her request (one less app on her phone), but I would have used the app method as it's pretty straight forward. It updated in about five minutes or less. With its six antennas it's not much to look at and each has a plastic rapper, which are a nuisance to remove.This is the WiFi 6e model, so make sure you are not buying the WiFi 6 model when you purchase. It was on sale for $159 (usually $199) so good value and works well in her 1900sf house. This comes with a built-in modem so she eliminated the cable company's unit and will save $6/mo. WiFi 7 is out there, but expensive and this should work well for a few years. This may work well in a larger home, but I prefer a mesh router system for my larger house and property, especially when I'm outside using my phone. Netgear is a reliable company with a reputation for good service. If you can find it on sale, I would buy it. Good luck!",

The only thing is make sure your devices are 6G in order to use 6G. A few new devices are setup, but majority of devices do not use 6G.",
