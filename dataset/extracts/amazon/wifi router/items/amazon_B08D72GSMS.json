                "reviewText": "I've increased from 3 stars to 4 as a result of the following workaround. Can't give 5 stars because the workaround was necessary, and because it took many hours to find!The following apparently solves the problem of being stuck with 2.4G (Wifi 4). Despite all my previous efforts, the device would eventually revert to 802.11n which is limited to 2.4G and Wifi 4. Then I found this:1) Control Panel -> Network and Sharing Center.Identify the TP-Link adapter device. Right mouse -> Properties. Then Configure. Driver tab. Uninstall Device (and attempt to remove driver). Then IMMEDIATELY unplug the USB device.2) Control panel -> Programs and features - TP-Link Archer driver (etc) - if it exists, uninstall it.3) Plug in the Linksys Archer T3U into Windows 11 computer USB 3.0 portThen Right-click on This PC -> Manage; then select Device Manager.Under Network Adapters find TP-Link wireless USB AdapterRight mouse click on the device, then select PropertiesGo to the Advanced tabClick on \"Wireless Mode\". In the drop-down box, select IEEE 802.11acClick on \"OK\"If the above solution does not remain successful, I will come back and edit again.ORIGINAL REVIEWThis TP-Link AC-1300 Archer TCU Plus adapter works like it is supposed to.... but only IF you use the latest driver from the TP-Link web site. Based on my experience, the driver that is included on the DVD only gives you Wifi 4 (802.11n) compatibility. Similarly, when I plugged it in without first installing any driver, Windows only supplied a 802.11n driver.The driver I downloaded from the TP-Link web site gives Wifi 5 (802.11ac) compatibility. In Windows 11, once I installed this adapter and connected to a network, I checked what kind of connection I got via the Wifi icon on the bottom right of the task bar. I clicked on that icon, and then on the \">\" symbol next to the Wifi connection. Then click on the blue \"i\" in the blue circle next to the connection. Under \"Protocol\" iit shows what kind of connection you have: Wifi 4 (802.11n) or Wifi5 (802.11ac).Be sure to install the new downloaded driver BEFORE you plug in the new adapter. Otherwise the 802.11n driver will be automaticaly installed by Windows, and you'll need to uninstall it before you can get the new driver to install properly. If you've already installed the driver from the disk that came with the adapter, you'll need to go into the Control Panel -> Programs and Features to uninstall it before installing the downloaded driver. If instead you attempt to install the downloaded driver without removing the one from the disk yourself, the downloaded installer will attempt to remove it, but will fail. It will appear to have worked, but you'll still get only 802.11n.Once I figured all that out and navigated it successfully, the adapter works wonderfully - significantly better than the adapter inside my PC. I've deducted two stars for the installation challenges. There are multiple ways to get it installed incorrectly. I suspect a lot of people are just using it as an 802.11n device without realizing it. I hope this review helps some people get the full benefits of this device. When properly installed, it is a significant improvement on the adapter inside my PC.ORIGINAL EDIT: I've had to turn off Windows driver updates and also uninstall Dell Support Assist because both services replace the driver for this adapter with an incorrect driver (which lacks 802.11ac support.) If you're not willing to do that, you might want to consider a different adapter.",

                "reviewText": "I needed WiFi capabilities for my desktop PC so I purchased this adapter. The adaptor was not recognized by Windows 10. However, the PC also had issues with another PCI-E NIC card I added. I suspect it's a problem with different versions of NIC drivers. I contacted TP-Link and they eventually responded. However, by that time I already returned the card. Hence, I give it 5 stars for getting support for a product that I think under normal circumstances would work just fine.",

When it comes to quality, the antenna offers solid construction and stable connectivity. Transmission speeds are fast, providing a smooth online experience, whether streaming, online gaming or working from home.Among the highlights, the consistent performance and signal range are impressive. However, the design could be more compact to avoid any clutter on the neighboring USB port. A small compromise for peak performance. For optimal use, be sure to position the adapter out of the way to avoid interference. Regular driver updates are recommended to ensure optimal performance.",
