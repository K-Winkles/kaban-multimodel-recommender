However, since using this repeater, those dead spots have disappeared, and I now have a strong and stable WiFi connection throughout my house.The repeater has greatly improved my internet signal strength, and I no longer experience lag or buffering while streaming content. It has also improved the speed and reliability of my online gaming sessions.In addition to its performance, the repeater's sleek and compact design blends seamlessly with my home decor, and it doesn't take up any valuable floor space.

It seems to be a defect with the device and are sending a new one to make things right. I appreciate the customer service team for helping me with the situation.I just purchased this item, plugged it in to the outlet, and began the Repeater Mode installation method of connecting. I was able to identify the extender\u2019s network on my phone\u2019s Wi-Fi search (using the 5G network) and it initiated their connecting app. Started fine as I selected the Repeater mode. It then began the search for my home 5G network. Mid search, the connecting app crashes unexpectedly. I try to re-access the extender\u2019s 5G network and my phone informs me that I am unable to connect to the network.I reached out to their customer service email just now so I will see what they have to say.I\u2019ll edit this review after hearing back.",

My router was installed in my basement, which weakens the signal in my garage. I put it in my kitchen, that gives the garage a lot more signal. I can also get the signal in my backyard now. I am happy to own it, which gives me stable Wifi throughout the house inside and outside.",

Now we have signal in other rooms where we normally would either get buffering or just dropped connection altogether. Another good thing I liked is that there are no wires! Just plug it into an outlet and set it up.",
