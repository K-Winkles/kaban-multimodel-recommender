It's paid off in a couple of brown & black outs and resultant restoration work in keeping her naps lightly lit and white noisy like she likes them. This housing keeps it all tucked away in a nice somewhat boring (for a tiny human) box. It's also very easy to get access for people who find the box significantly more exciting, so when new hardware needs to be added, it's easy to dig in to the box.I come home from cable managing for money to spend money cable managing. C'est la vie. The box is nice.Oh, and I'm editing to add that my daughter likes to treat this as another chair in the room, and she's almost two. So it supports a decent amount of weight. Added a photo of this oddity. Ignore the plethora of new and not yet managed cables.",
