                "reviewText": "Before buying this I had a couple inexpensive TP-Link unmanaged switches that had worked well and this had really good reviews so I decided to go for it. The UI is simple to use, it is small and NEVER even gets warm to the touch, and has very good long range for both 2.4GHS and 5GHZ WiFi. Also the WiFi 6 speeds are outstanding on this unit. It supports WOL (\"Wake-On-Lan\") flawlessly. (If you use WOL, you will need a reliable DDNS service, which usually costs some $, but this router supports you setting up TP-lInk (for free!) as your DDNS service provider which I thought was terrific.) This will also act as a VPN SERVER for people that want to connect to this router's network through an encrypted VPN tunnel. Not sure how to phrase this as I want to leave an outstanding review... If you want to use a VPN Provider for your internet access for tighter internet security - you can still do that by using VPN software on your devices behind this router with no issue. However, if you want router itself to act as VPN CLIENT to connect to your VPN provider's servers for internet access so that everything on your internal network is already therefore on a VPN for internet access (which most people do not want to do these days due to the router setup complexity and hassle) - then that is the only use case where I can see this is not a good candidate as it does not support acting as VPN CLIENT (acting as VPN SERVER it works fine). That is outside the scope of this piece of equipment. After using this router for a while I decided to use a VPN provider and so got a wired TP-Link TL-ER7206 VPN router (please read my review for that), so did not any longer need this as my main router. Therefore, I now also have plenty of experience with this router being used simply a a wireless access point (WAP) in my network. I have done this before with other routers as I had replaced them in years past, but found that those other models did not support being a WAP very well and slowed down my speeds. Not so with this model - it is still just as fast for the WiFi access - still supplying WiFi 6 when operating in \"Access Point\" mode. Outstanding piece of hardware supporting most if not all of the most recent technologies. One more thing - many pieces of networking equipment, when you want to update the firmware, require you to go to the vendor's web site, find the correct firmware for your model, download it, then go to the configuration page for your piece of equipment and upload the file to do the firmware update. That is simply a pain. However, for this router, in full or access point mode, there is one button on the configuration page to check the TP-Link site for - install - an update if there is one. Easy-peasy - nice! (Please also check out my reviews for the TP-LInk EAP225 Access Point, TP-Link TL-ER7206 Wired VPN Router, and TP-Link OC300 Controller.)",

                "reviewText": "So far... I really don't understand the the hate for this product.I've setup both the Archer 7 and the AX10Now, one could make the simple argument that the Archer 7 has better range with more potential bandwidth and to the person with a midsize to large house, I would have to agree that for similar price items, Archer 7 is the better choice.However, I live in a 1200 ft. apartment and extreme range is simply overkill and merely a nuisance to my neighbors. The AX10 is equiped with WiFi 6 compatibility allowing for tldr: better power efficiency and better efficiency with multiple devices running at the same time. Now it should be noted again that without devices from 2018 + you probably won't have wifi 6 compatibe devices meaning you won't get full benefit but it certainly does future proof your house and all wifi devices will still work just fine with this router.The Setup:Honestly, it took me all about 5 minutes to get this thing set up. Plugged it into my modem, powered it on, installed the app, and it finished up within a few minutes and I was connected. I was highly impressed with the setup process. 5/5Connection quality:Wifi has been running for about a week and I've noticed no disconnects or even slowdowns really. It's important to note: the 2.4Ghz band is not extremely powerful, so of you have a ton of devices that use old 2.4 bands, you're better off with another router as my speeds on that band are meh at best. This 2.4Ghz band on this device is intended for smart home devices in my opinion whereas computers, laptops, TV's, gaming consoles should all be on the 5Ghz band. I will post images on each band at the farthest point in my 1200 ft. apartment with the speeds I got on my phone. For perspective, I pay for 100 Mbps download and 10 Mbps upload speed. As the picture shows, on the 5G band on the opposite side of my apartment I still have flawless speed but the 2.4G band is as I said, \"meh\". It's enough to get the job done and should only be used on devices that only have the option for 2.4 band or devices that only use a little bit of connectivity. Connection 4.25/5Range:As I stated, the range is perfect for my 1200 ft. apartment. If you get too much bigger I would worry about losing the signal on the 5Ghz band and would leave you with a poor speed at best. You could probably stretch the range to a 2000 ft. Home, bit personally I wouldn't test it unless you're ready to buy a repeater/ extender with it or have one lying around. If you have a bigger house and still want wifi 6, you're probably going to have to shell out more than $65 USD, but if you're happy without WiFi 6, then Archer 7 for medium size houses should be plenty.Range: 3.5/5For my purposes this device gets a 5/5. Moving into a new apartment can be a nightmare, especially when trying to connect to the internet. With a rapid install and an easy to use app that allows for on the fly modifications, firmware updates, scheduled router reboot times, and perfect total apartment speeds, I have all that I need from this device with so far no regrets.If I run into problems with router I will update as I know for a fact that tp-link customer service can be a nightmare...",

Both in wired and wireless. Setup was very easy and once plugged in I was up and running in less than 5mins.I watched several reviews on youtube before deciding on this router. While there were some early reviews which didn't give it a high score, there have been firmware updates over the past year or two which seem to have fixed pretty much all the problems people complained about. And for the price, you are getting a name brand wifi 6 router for much cheaper than pretty much anything else out there.I have been using this router to play wireless VR games streamed to my headset (steam VR to a Quest 2) and it runs really, really well. No connection problems and everything plays very smoothly, even on high settings. Very happy with the speeds I have been getting with it and it has pretty decent range as well.Great buy for the price. There might be newer wireless routers out there with newer/more options, but they can't beat this for the price and what you get. Just plug it in and go without taking a bit hit to the wallet.",
