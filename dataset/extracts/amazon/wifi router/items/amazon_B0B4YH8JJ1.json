                "reviewText": "If money is no object and strong reliable WiFi signal is the objective, this is the solution. Like many, I\u2019ve transitioned to a work from home environment and more than ever need a strong reliable WiFi signal at home. For the first few months working remotely, I was fine using the dining room table as a make shift home office, but that was a temporary solution. I eventually relocated my home office to a spare bedroom on another floor. The relocation was an improvement in my personal life, but my internet speed suffered. Significantly. I was dropping calls, had slow download speed and needed to find a solution. Initially, I opted for a simple, inexpensive WiFi extender/repeater. The WiFi extender/repeater worked fine for a couple weeks and seemed like a reasonable solution. I actually reviewed that product very favorably. For the price (less than $50), it was a reasonable attempted solution, but like the dining room table as my home office, the repeater was a temporary solution. It required a shadow second network and the connection would bounce in and out. The repeater was a bandaid; I needed stable reliable internet for video conferences, data heavy downloads and uploads and I was paying for a lot that I wasn\u2019t getting in certain areas of my home \u2014 mainly, my new home office! The WiFi extender worked, but only gave me about 60% of the signal I was paying for. I looked at Upgrading my internet package and then looked at a mesh system. The Orbi system was literally 10x the price of my prior bandaid, but WOW! 10x as good. Problem solved. Solid, stable, strong, reliable WiFi signal in every nook and cranny of my home. I went from unstable 60% signal strength to a blanket of strong reliable 99% WiFi connectivity throughout my home. I obsessively checked and rechecked Speedtest.net \u2014 bingo! No bouncing in and out. No checking which bandwidth or competing for signal; this product provides strong, solid, stable, complete WiFi signal through out the home. I\u2019m thrilled and can\u2019t believe I paid so much, but also can\u2019t believe I wasted my time and money on anything else. The Orbi is next generation awesome. Easy set up, same network and while I worried I would need more of the signal/units to cover my 3000 sq/ft home given the experience with the WiFi extender/repeater, I did not. One router and one signal was plenty for my concrete 3 story home with the router tucked in the basement and office on third story. The app is easy to use, intuitive and frustration free. I am no tech guru and I had zero problems installing or making it work. This is a no brainer for anyone that needs a reliable blanket of WiFi signal through out their home. I considered other mesh systems but read reviews, did research and decided that this system was an investment in the next generation technology and would last the longest. With out question, it is among the most expensive solutions, but I have complete confidence that it is the best solution on the market at the time of this review. The WiFi signal strength in my home is now so strong that the WiFi picks up outside. If you have money to burn and are demanding of excellence, this is 100% the way to go. I read dozens of articles and watched and read reviews and talked to every tech person I knew before sucking it up and crushing my internet speed problem. If you are on the fence, go for it.",

                "reviewText": "Despite customer service telling me that you can not support two networks with the same APP; it is a breeze to add the satellite to the mesh network. The only problem I see is that a device installed within 10 feet from a satellite unit that relays via another linked unit .. will gravitate toward making the long haul connection to the the distant (> 50 feet) unit ; in order to most likely ; eliminate hops and minimize latency speeds. The new addon unit was found to not have any WiFi connected device loading, as all IOT and mobile devices gravitate toward connecting to the upstream master's.Is this addon really needed ? - Watch your App mapping and individual connected devices ; then evaluate for yourself if the addon really helps your network connectivity.It would have been nice if the router and mesh supports locking your wifi connecting devices to a specific mesh unit , and eliminating the automatic mesh long haul connection attempts that caused the disruptive bouncing around of connection reaches for the client device.",

The 1900 ft.\u00b2 trilevel home one router covers the entire home and all floors and I have no issue, however my parents home is about 2500 ft.\u00b2 at ranch and my parents have an exterior garage approximately a quarter mile away from the house where the router is. I placed a Wi-Fi extender in the garage and now I\u2019m able to get Internet out in the garage for the computer and also to stream Netflix in the garage. Extenders work perfect and give huge range. My parents have 6 acres and just three extenders. Allow us to have Internet in the entire yard with no lag and no issue.If there is any type of consumable the product it would be its expensive. However, if you look for deals such as Black Friday, you can get it super cheap for the product itself. It is worth the money.",

I spent over 2 hours trying to get this to sync with my system with no luck. This is what I ended up having to do, and id assume this will work for whomever runs into this issue. Start by plugging the new satellite into the Orbi router with an Ethernet cable. Plug the new satellite into power and wait for it to boot up (usually 2 minutes). Wait for the light on the satellite to turn blue and then turn off. At this point open a web browser and log into the Orbis interface (192.168.1.1) enter your username and password when prompted, then select attached devices and find the IP address of the new satellite. Once you've located the new satellites IP address open a new tab and enter the new satellites IP address into the address bar and login (Username:admin/password:password). Once you've logged into the new satellites web interface look for the firmware version and compare it to your existing Orbi firmware. If it doesn't match you need to manually update the new satellite firmware. Open a new tab and search RBS750 firmware. Find the firmware version that matches your current system from the Netgear support site only (not 3rd party). Once you've located the correct firmware download it to your desktop. When it's finished downloading extract the zip file to your desktop. The firmware file will end with .chk . Now go back to the browser tab for the new satellite and select firmware/update Firmware then select browse and navigate to the unzipped folder you downloaded and select the file ending .chk and update. This process can take up to 19 minutes. Once the satellite is finished and there is no light coming from the new satellite unplug it from your router and place where you want it and plug it back into power. After the light on the new satellite finishes blinking it should go blue for a moment then off. If the placement is poor you may get an amber light instead of blue and magenta if it's too far from the Orbi router. This is how I got mine to work, I hope this helps someone in the same situation. After all this it works great for me.",

                "reviewText": "Love My Orbi. This router is made by Netgear, which is a very reputable company for routers and modems according to reviewers in the IT industry. I researched my heart out and read 100's of reviews in order to understand routers and modems and what was the best because I am not tech savvy at all. I learned it is better to have a separate modem and router, not a 2 in 1. And that the modem is specific to the internet service provider (you have to use their own) but a router is not. You can use whatever router you want. Most often the internet company will give you or rent to you a modem with a router built in. This means it's a modem that also gives off a WiFi signal. A modem by itself does not. I learned if you're given a 2 in 1 modem from the internet company you can put it into \"bridge mode\" and use your own router. So if theres ever a problem, the support technician will be able to isolate the problem quickly. Also, having an individual router works better than a 2 in 1. Much stronger, bigger WiFi signal. So that's what I did. I bought a separate router.Orbi was very easy to set up. I called my internet provider (tech support), and they walked me through how to set up my modem and Orbi. All I had to do was change the default password that Orbi came with in order to secure the WiFi signals. Orbi is tri band. He sends out 3 wifi signals. A 2.4 Ghz, 5.0 Ghz, 5.0 Ghz. Orbi automatically chooses which signal to use, the fastest, at any given time. No more having to manually change from 2.4 to 5.0 or back. Orbi is capable of speeds up to 2.2 Gigabytes (that's incredibly fast. The fastest speeds most internet companies offer is 250 mbps). Orbi is very nice looking. He is shaped like an egg and is white. So you don't even notice him. You can add \"satellite\" Orbies to him to widen/strengthen the signal across your whole house (this is called a \"mesh\"system). I live in an apartment so I only needed 1.Also, the next time I need to upgrade my modem (which has a max speed of 1.2 gigabytes) I won't have to upgrade my router because Orbi is capable of 2.2 gigabytes.So happy with my new Orbi. I've had him for about a month now, and it's been fantastic. I have him wirelessly hooked up to my laptop, printer, cell phone, iPad, TV, bluray player, and Apple TV box. Thanks Netgear for the next generation of awesome, kick ass routers!",
