                "reviewText": "Upon opening the packaging you're prompted to use the Nighthawk proprietary app. This app was one of the most obnoxious and clunky options to use for quick setup I've ever experienced.The steps tell you only a portion at a time, which will likely lead you to have to redo steps. Not the end of the world but inconvenient nonetheless. Followed up with the box not containing ANY manual whatsoever so if you're looking to find out any other features you're going to have to do research on a system that may not need the wifi router you're currently installing. Once you jump through a bunch of hoops the firmware is forced to update which can brick the router altogether and cause performance issues going forward. If you're lucky enough to set up the SSID you'll be prompted to allow the app to search for the connection you're setting up however the wifi signal may reinitialize anytime during this step so you have to HOPE it actually stays connected long enough to finish this step.I don't know what follows this step because my app force closed and crashed on me. However at this point I was connected to the wifi with internet access. So I though all was good. Too bad that only 20 minutes and a few speed tests later the wifi signal is dropped and the indicator light is blinking orange implying it isn't online. And it was right. No internet access anymore. So I used the app to reboot the router and it did nothing. Had to go to the router itself and power cycle it.This router I received must've been bad because I cannot fathom this is a common occurrence. But honestly, I recommend just putting in the extra funds to get something that ISN'T Netgear related at all. I regret giving them a chance after years of moving on from them.",

I was happy to see how user friendly it was, when compared to my previous router where I had to spend more time googling things just so I could get a idea of what a setting did.All in all, I think my down time was about 1 hour, and thats cause I wanted to be really thorough before turning the wifi back on, make sure all my gadgets were recognized and most importantly that my internet speed was as fast as it could be.I had no issues, the WiFi range is incredible, no device connects to this thing without me knowing it - and its clear what each device is.",

R6400V2 and R6700V3 even share same firmware. Why pay more for R6700V3? Another good thing from this product is, it embedded Disney Circle parental control feature, very easy to block YouTube and other social media services. With Circle history log record, you always know what your kids visited and be able to block sites with one click from history log. You can add all your kids\u2019 computers, smart phone, etc devices in one group and use one click from circle app to turn on/off their internet access without interference other computers in your home. Such a great feature for parents!This WiFi router has three external antennas, supports two wireless band (5Ghz and 2.4Ghz), but only with SU-MIMO and MIMO configured as 3X3:3 on both wireless band.For most of families, MU-MIMO may not as good as product manufacturers claimed, especially for those MU-MIMO products only have three or four antennas.",

                "reviewText": "Great router for my cable modem. The router is mounted in the garage on the exterior wall where the modem is located. It was easy to install and provides good signal across my 3,300 sq ft house (three levels). To improve security, I use the CAT5 hardwire connection for my desktop computer, and a RATTRAP firewall between the modem and router. I also have a Netgear AC1200 wifi extender located on the opposite end of the house to extend the wifi signal to the furthest corner of our 0.8 acre property. This system has been very reliable and trouble-free. We often have three users streaming video simultaneously in different parts of the house without any problems.",
