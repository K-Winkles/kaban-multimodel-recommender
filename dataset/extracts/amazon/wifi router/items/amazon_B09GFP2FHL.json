                "reviewText": "I took a chance on the Reyee AX6000 after doing a lot of research on the company, which apparently has been in the commercial side for a while but is a more recent entrant into the consumer side. I needed to replace my Linksys MR9600 (AX6000) which had been rock solid but had started to drop connection several times a week.The Reyee comes with a cat5e ethernet cable I think, so anyone wanting to take full advantage of the 2.5G WAN port might want to get a cat6 cable. The setup instructions are pretty basic but got me online in a few minutes. I had to download a full manual and look up videos on youtube to learn how to fully setup the router. I used my laptop to access the ip address instead of using the app. The interface itself gives you a lot of control, although I chose to simplify things since I had heard the fewer things you ask the router to do, the better the chance to run smoothly. I kept my SSIDs split and used the same names as before. Powercycling my devices afterwards helped performance, especially my laptop, which at first had erratic download speeds on wifi. However, my wifi garage door opener hasn't recovered yet.My gamer son reports that this router is faster and more stable (he does Nintendo with ethernet). I can tell that the speeds are generally faster than with the Linksys and have a greater range throughout my 2500 sq. ft ranch-style house. Buried deep in the settings is the option to adjust the power of the wifi signal. Using my laptop app I was able to see that the Reyee signal was stronger by itself than that of the Linksys (which I had extended with a MESH unit).I'm pretty impressed so far, and hope it remains stable over the long haul. My biggest complaint so far is the light documentation it came with, but there are enough youtube videos and online manuals to help you configure the router if you need to really tweak it. Also, the videos might still have the 20% off coupon so look one up before you purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I travel with as US civil servant overseas in Europe and Asia and the wifi that came with true modem gave poor quality and was terrible. I conducted a speed test and the information stated my wifi was moving at the speed of a snails pace. I was next to the internet providers router. This was ridiculous. I even used 3 wifi meshed repeaters systems and it still struggled to get 2 bars. The homes are all made of poured concrete and cement. After the constant frustration of poor wifi and reviewing the great astonishing reviews of the Reyye gaming router I decided to purchase this. This exceeded my expectations. The APP on be Apple Store does work well and it is easy to use. Don\u2019t listen to any negative reviews. I set this thing up in 10 minutes on the app. You can use the computer to set up but it\u2019s really just plug and play. The system even decides which signal is better either 5g or 2.4g. I have signal throughout the house and the backyard. When I added a different brand of mesh repeaters, I have full bars throughout the whole hose. That is unheard of in Germany, Korea, and Japan where the houses are concrete. I plan to order Reyes mesh repeaters to keep it within the same eco system. I can monitor the signal status on the app. However, for now this router works great. I would not use this on repeater mode because I do not want to broadcast the intent provider\u2019s wifi poor signal.If you are struggling with wifi signal get this router and the Reyes mesh repeater. This is worth every penny.",
