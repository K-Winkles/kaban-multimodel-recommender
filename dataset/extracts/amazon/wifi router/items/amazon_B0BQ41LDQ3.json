                "reviewText": "Update 13 July 2023: Another recent cabling upgrade by our ISP in our neighborhood. ASUS ROG GT-AXE11000 wins again\u203c\ufe0fShould be (Plan)/Actual Speeds Achieved\ud83d\udedc Download: 500 MBPS / 601.64 MBPS\ud83d\udedc Upload: 10 MBPS / 53.17 MBPS\ud83d\udfe7 This \u261d\ufe0f is the highest speed I tested afterwards \u2014 601.64 MBPS download\u203c\ufe0f\ud83d\udfe9 Last upgrade was 1.25 years ago from 150 MBPS up to 250 MBPS (3/16/2022), & we were pulling close to 300 MBPS, on average, consistently.\ud83d\udeab No price change for us for these upgrades.\u2014\u2014Update: 03/16/2022: My ISP just bumped my Data Plan up by \u2153 from 150 MBPS to 250 MBPS for FREE (Same $ for plan). First good thing they\u2019ve done in a LONG time. Originally, I reported speeds improved achieving 180 MBPS consistently, & now hitting 288-299 MBPS since they upgraded lines (still <1 week in) in my neighborhood. Proud to report (so far) NO ISSUES with the GT-AXE11000 Router failing as many saw when pushing speeds near or over 1 - 1.2 GBPS or over 100 wifi clients on a residential router. I still LOVE this thing. Still 1 month shy of 6-months where some owners reported CPU in their router checked out (multiple ASUS models) & lost significant speed performance. If that happens, I will update this \u201cupdate.\u201d I do NOT regret buying this at $550 even though WIFI6E is still effectively \u201cDOA\u201d (limited devices still at the end of Q1 2022). WIFI 7 may come out 1st at this rate (Target was/is 2025?).\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Original Review for Amazon for ASUS Router AXE11000Note: Be sure to verify any reviews you read HERE apply to the router YOU want. Many reviews here are for various ASUS routers: AXE11000, AX11000, AX6000, etc. This review is for their AXE11000, which came out to market in Feb 2021.Purchase Date: 09/13/2021, online & configured 09/21/2021; long-term performance to be determined.I recently upgraded from a D-Link DIR-890L/R bought in 2015. It is ridiculous that support ends in 4 years & obsolete by the 5th (I digress). This top of the line router was $350 in 2015, now flagship routers cost like this ASUS $550 or more. Expensive? Yes! Worth it? YES!!The thing I most despised about it (old one), & 95% of all routers on the market for home networks, is they are most or all auto-configured with little manual customization available, or none at all. You WON\u2019T have that issue with the ASUS GT-AXE11000!! I saw many reviews \u201cding it\u201d for supporting 6E but the market is extremely limited in 6E Tech even now. I\u2019ve been wanting this ASUS Router since I saw the preview announcements back in 2020. Here is why I love it & you will as well.1. Supports 6E despite market is still not ready with 6E NIC\u2019s or other devices. Give it time. This was the 1st router that supported 6e\u2014of course it wasn\u2019t ready when launched back in Feb 2021 \u2013 duh?! An ASUS firmware fix will make all well with 6e soon. Hopefully the market will offer more 6e devices in the next 6 months (semiconductor shortage makes that not likely)!! That is NOT ASUS\u2019 fault (6e market or silicon chip shortage).2. Every setting practically is manually configurable if you wish or you can get most settings automatically configured if not a Tech person. I am, so I LOVE it.3. AI Protection Pro \u2014 You get Lifetime AI Protection against spyware, adware, & ransomware updates from the Internet that get pulled by your devices via YOUR router & modem. Again, MOST routers on the market have no protection built in, much less free, with lifetime updates! My wife\u2019s work computer has seen multiple malicious programs attempt access that this feature stopped from infecting either her computer or spreading onto router or our other home network devices. We sent the reports to her employer\u2019s IT Team to investigate.4. WiFi Radar \u2014 Instead of paying an additional $500 or more for a Network (SSID) Analyzer Program or Subscription for Wireless Channel Stats, & Site Survey, this feature set is included for FREE! You don\u2019t need other programs to see what channel your neighbors chose for 2.4G, 5G or 6G & the interference you may get competing on those busy channels from neighboring devices. You also can create reports by scanning as often as you like. This alone makes the $550 Router a real bargain. IT Network people tell users to choose, for example: Channel 1, 6, or 11 for their center channel using 2.5 GHz. The problem is everyone knows this as they have heard this same counsel for over a decade!! Your neighbors know this too. Guess which are the busiest channels in 2021 (at least in my hood)?5. Traffic Analyzer \u2014 tells you which Top 5 devices (& programs or service\u2014like streaming on device) are MOST responsible for data downloads & graphs it. For example, when my son is home from college during the summer, we easily exceed 100 GB of data per day downloaded between him & us working, gaming, or streaming from home. My ISP charges & throttles if you go over your allocation based on monthly use. This feature makes it easy to KNOW 100% which devices are the culprit & specific activities or program most responsible on it. My son is a gamer like I am, but we regularly hit 30-35 GB/day when he isn\u2019t home. We had to assume it was his PC Gaming that was the issue (he was downloading too much or in a dead zone even with a WiFi booster). We didn\u2019t definitively know, but NOW WE DO!! I love this too.If you want a manually configurable router with tons of settings (95% of what is out there doesn\u2019t support it to this degree for home users), & all the benefits above included, then get this already. The streaming & gaming quality & speeds we do in my home (I tested) are improved over my last router. Consistently reaches 10-50 MBPS more for download speed than an AC3200 router. If this is what you are looking for as well, then this is for you!My ISP frequently has downtime issues in my neighborhood so download speeds varied from 60-180 MBPS using my old router over this past year. Now, 180 MBPS consistently unless ISP goes down. Those of you who have better internet packages should see a proportional dramatic improvement as I did for mine. Have had no issues since installing & configuring it. Have I said I LOVE my ASUS ROG GT-AXE11000? (We have 35 client devices \u2014 16-20 of those are active daily too, ranging from PC\u2019s, MacBook, iPhones, iPad, AppleTV\u2019s, gaming consoles (plural), and so on with no connectivity issues). My old router required daily reboot or suffered degraded performance when video conferencing. The new router I reboot 2x a week per auto schedule. Again, flawless so far.",

                "reviewText": "The GT-AXE16000 is a great router in my experience with it thus far. The coverage of the Wi-Fi is good in the lower spec bands, 2.4G / 5G / but is very short on devices accessing the 6G band. The performance of the unit itself is excellent and using the Ai-Mesh feature to connect to my other ASUS router, it adequately provides whole home coverage. The 2.5G WAN port is great connected to the 2G fiber service I have and can consume all of it. The addition of twin 10G LAN ports plus the standard quad 1G ports has helped me expand my backbone to 10G throughout the home. It is a great companion to my GT-AX6000 router acting as an Ai-Mesh AP partner to it. It has a great software interface providing all the necessary elements for enhanced gaming and protection for your network. It is not however a small device so have adequate space to place it where you will use it. Like other ASUS network products I have purchased it does a great job of making sure it is running the latest firmware for itself and its Ai-Mesh partner. In addition to the good performance, the device has a failover feature to an alternate ISP source if one is available to keep your network up and running when the primary ISP stops responding. This has happened to me recently and the router did the quick switch to the backup WAN and nothing missed a beat. Super feature! Thus far a rock solid addition to my home network. I could not rate the Tech Support part of the review as I have had no issues with the unit thus far.",

                "reviewText": "Es un producto realmente robusto, se siente de calidad, la caja en la que viene el producto es muy bonita y se siente imponente, hay varios puntos que me gustaria destacar que me gustan sobre este router de gama alta.1.- La sencilles con la que se puede configurar en la app de Asus Router2.-Cuando un usuario se conecta a la red del router, este manda un aviso a la app del celular , para asi poder bloquear al usuario en caso de ser alguien desconocido, es una funcion que me gusta mucho para controlar quien se conecta a mi red, lastima que solo este disponible en routers asus de alta gama como este3.-Permite un alto ancho de banda, ya que con otros routers que eh probado no me llegaban a dar todo el ancho de banda contratado por mi proveedor, y con la tecnologia de wifi 6, realmente se aprovecha el ancho de banda4.-Facil gestion desde la app para asignar dispositivos a una especie de grupo familiar, donde se puede definir horarios para uso de internet, muy util para definir el tiempo que pasan los ni\u00f1os en internet, asi como tambien para bloquear ciertas paginas, ya sea para adultos, o de streaming5.-Poder bloquear un usuario de forma remota, si te encuentras fuera de casa, puedes abrir la aplicacion en el celular y donde sea que te encuentres puedes bloquear un usuario o negarle el acceso a internet (lo unico malo que tarda un poco en hacer esta conexion), util cuando se conecta alguien desconocido o sin permisoEn general es un excelente dispositivo, cumple por lo que estas pagando, solo que por el precio no es para cualquier usuario.",
