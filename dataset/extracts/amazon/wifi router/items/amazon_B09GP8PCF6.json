                "reviewText": "Ordered this to replace the router provided by my ISP. I have worked as a systems engineer for a long time so I have administered probably every type of router out there. This router has a very robust admin user interface. Parental controls are great, as I can add different devices to certain groups I have setup. One of those groups makes it so that any device in that group, is blocked from accessing adult content. Another group is designed so that it turns internet on at 8:30, and shuts the internet off on those devices at 10 PM. You can set daily time limits per device as well. The wireless range is very good. I have a detached shop, and my smart devices in that shop have no issues connecting to the WiFi.This router also has security software built in, so that any threats often times get stopped by the router. This is a great feature because it protects all of the devices on the network from malicious content.I also like the QoS settings in the router. Most routers that have QOS, you turn it on, and set it to let's say gaming. So now all gaming data has top priority, and anyone not gaming might experience slowness. But on this router, I can specify what data that device will be sending. For example, when I connected my TV, I set the QoS for the specific device to \"streaming\". When I connected my Xbox, I set that QoS to \"gaming\". This router allows you to configure specific devices to help streamline your router and make it more efficient.The router was a breeze to setup, and has an app that allows you to monitor the network, check internet speeds, and change lots of the settings from the app. For more advanced settings, you need to use the webpage interface.I would recommend this router to anyone looking for an overall upgrade, great wireless coverage, parental controls, built in VPN connection options, and built in security.",

Plug it in and scan the QR code on the back or use the app. I used the app to set up the router. Only took about 10min total for everything. The app has tons of features allows you to configure easily. I love that I have my own network and password even though I\u2019m plugged into the landlords router upstairs kinda piggybacking off his router. Even though I\u2019m piggybacking the speed it not reduced at all. The devices I have connected are all on the first floor bedroom which is about over 600sq ft. I have connected: Ps5, Apple TV, 2 HomePods, iPad, iphone, and my work PC. All running perfectly on the network. I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t go cheap! I believe this is a fairly good price for a nice router. I also like the fact that it\u2019s made in Taiwan not China.The Ethernet ports are nice to have but literally don\u2019t need them with how fast this is. I\u2019m a minimalist so I hate all the wires. I was looking for a strong router to remove my dependence on wires and this was it! I can\u2019t give stars for tech support because I did not need it. But there are instructions that come with the router that are helpful. You don\u2019t need a PC I set this up all with my iPhone and the app",

                "reviewText": "I've had this router for a few months now, and I have to say it is simply amazing. run on the latest WiFi 6, which was easy to install by using the Asus apps available at the Play Store. I had used all 4 ports connected to my Sonos surround system, PS5, Sony TV, and subwoofer, and I also had 1 USB that was connected to a cooling fan to cool it down. It never lags or has any single issue with it. I had to buy another one as the main router due to its reliability, and the most solid reason was its stability. but the second one that I bought was used and indicated as very good. Somehow the item is still brand new, sealed, and wrapped. and the cable and the adapter are still unopened and untouched, but the price is much cheaper, making it definitely worth the buy.",

After just a couple months I got Google fiber and they pushed a two router mesh for free and went with that so I sold the Asus for little loss. However google routers suck. In a 2700 sq ft house the signal would constantly drop to nothing.So I went back to Asus and got the AX86. Single router on the ground floor on one side of the house and the signal is great everywhere. Office up a floor and across the house gets 300Mbps. Also on that side of the house I have a wifi Arduino using 2.4ghz and that has a constant, steady connection which was really spotty with Google.Also, Google tries to keep things idiot proof so configuration options are really limited. The Asus router app is very powerful and let's you do anything in an easy interface.",

I have a much greater range with this router than my last one (another manufacturer). I like the availability to add other routers to increase my range. I have a family of four so and with our lifestyle of work, school and fun it handles our need. We recently had a camp out party at our house all 20 were able to use without any issues.
