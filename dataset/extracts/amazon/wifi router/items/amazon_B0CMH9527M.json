But I was looking for something that was economical, would provide better range for downstairs, plus be easy to set up.And this fit the bill perfectly! I downloaded the app from the bar code and had this extender plugged in and working in about 5 minutes! It was truly \"plug and play\"! And according to my son (the streamer and gamer) the WiFi range is outstanding! No more buffering, no more slow to load.We are super pleased. If you're looking for a wifi extender that is economical, offers great range, and has a user-friendly setup process - this is the one!",
