I took a chance on this one that had a low number of reviews, but all absolutely glowing, and boy am I glad I did! My old extender worked ok years, but started to tap out. I have finally found a replacement that works& even better than before :-) Set up was so simple, and I\u2019ve had no issue with lag or timing out so far. Would highly recommend giving this one a try.",
