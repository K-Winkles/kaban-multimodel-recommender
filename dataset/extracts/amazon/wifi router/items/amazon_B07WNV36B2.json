                "reviewText": "This router is great for those who is looking for a budget alternative to the provided router from their ISP ( Internet service provider ). This router is 3x cheaper than the router that was provided by my ISP. But in terms of performance, and what it's capable of; it's sure within the caliber of my previous router. Speeds will vary by which plan you have. I have Fiber optic internet , which means I could potentially get 1gb speeds on both download & upload. Am I getting it with this router? No, but I wasn't getting it with my previous router as well. I was getting on average 300-320Mbps Download & 340-360 Upload on my previous router. On this router, I am getting 290-310 Mbps Download & 320-340 Mbps Upload. That is the only time where I notice the price difference of each router . But from my day to day activities , it is well capable enough for my family . We have 4 Smart TV's connected to it, 6 smartphones, 3 Laptops, and 2 consoles ; and let me say, it handled it well as the router that my ISP provided . It handled well for multiple devices gaming & 4K streaming simultaneously. The setup was quite simple, connect the WAN cable to it's designated port, go to the website as stated in the instruction and the user interface is quite easy to navigate around. I was scared in the beginning as I was able to connect to the Wifi network without a password but as you change the settings on the website, I have changed the network name as well as added a password on top of it. I turned off the \" patented touch \" feature as I prefer the old school method of entering the password but it's a handy feature ; needless to say. The \" Turbo \" feature seems more like a gimmick rather than a practical feature, but it allows you to optimize your network speeds for a good period of time . In terms of reliability , I haven't owned this router long enough to give you guys the information you might want to know, but i'll be updating this review in a few months. I highly recommend this router to those who are looking for a better alternative to those who are still with their original router , renting a router monthly from your ISP isn't worth it when you can get this router and it'll be worth it in the long run .",

                "reviewText": "Update Review:I have returned this router. I had this router for 3 weeks now, and although it works, it would not reliably stream media. With Hulu, Disney +, and Amazon Prime, the stream would work, but would stutter massively to the point that anything streamed was useless. It would sometimes stream for about 3-5 minutes and then give a connection error.I removed it and put my old router back into place without making any other changes, and everything is working again without stuttering or failing. My old router, the one back in service, would drop it's 2.4Ghz signal every 36 hours or so, which is why I tried this router in the first place.That's what I get for trying the cheapest router out there. Looks like I'm shopping for a better router.---------- Original review:I read as much review data on this router as I could find before buying it, so I knew it would be cheap and would be missing features. It works. Mostly. Here's what it is missing:- A good web interface for configuring it. Every single item you update requires you to 'refresh to continue' which then brings you back to the login prompt. That's so annoying. The entire web interface is displayed to be be seen on a smart phone/tablet and there is a ton of wasted space displayed.- A logical startup configuration wizard. The initial configuration is extremely basic, and it might work for 80% of the users, but, at the end I kept getting into a 'refresh to continue' loop where it kept displaying the wizard over and over again. Because you MUST re-login for each settings up, you just end up back in the wizard.- Parental controls of any kind. There is no way to restrict access on this router. Zero. You cannot white list / blacklist sites. You cannot setup access control to the web (for instance, disable web access after 9pm). This is a very basic feature.- Routing. You cannot setup any kind of static routing.- The ability to use a different DHCP server on your network, like PiHole running DHCP. I tried this a couple of times, and it seems that the router intercepts the DHCP requests, but never forwards them to broadcast or honors the request if you disable DHCP on the router (see confusions below).- NAT routing from the LAN interface to the WAN interface. You can setup port forwards and even a DMZ to an internal server, but, if you do, you cannot get to services on that server from the LAN. I have a web server on port 88 on an internal server, but you cannot get to website.com:88 from the internal network. I need to setup complicated routing and port forwarding on a separate router to get around this.- You cannot setup Specific WPA2 settings for authentication (TKIP vs. AES) or anything in regards to more complicated authentication methods.- Compressive DDNS setup. You can only setup no-ip.com or changeip.com. That's it. I suspect that you can only update ONE DDNS hostname, too.Things that are very confusing about the setup:- There is no WAN or LAN setup. It has Internet settings and DHCP settings, instead. Under Internet Setup, you have basic setup information for ONLY DHCP, Static, and PPPoE. If you need anything besides those three setups, you are out of luck. In the DHCP Settings, you have Default (Router DHCP server enabled), Custom, or Disable. Default sets a default setup with a pre-defined IP range of 192.168.10.0/24. If you want to change the LAN of the router, or your network range, you have to select custom. Even then, it will keep reverting back to the 192.168.10.0/24 network on reboot. That's because when you apply the settings, it requires you to re-login. You can't if the IP changes. It loops. I honestly don't know if this router will come back on my network or revert to the 10-dot network when I reboot it next. Disable does NOT seem to disable the DHCP service on the router. It just stops replying to requests. If you run a secondary DHCP server like a PiHole, it does not seem to forward or broadcast the DHCP packet. I'm still researching, but that's a big surprise.- Port forwarding / Virtual servers is setup under the NAT Configuration page. There is nothing else related to NAT in this page, so I don't know what this configuration page is even called NAT. It only allows you to add / enable / disable port forwarding.- Wireless protocol setup defaults to using wide channel usage, which is a big no-no for crowded WIFI areas. You will have congestion and signal drops if you live in an apartment or crowded wireless space. You can set the channels, but it's hard to find under the advanced setup.- It has turbo button. I have no idea what turbo does.It does have mounting holes on the bottom of it, so you can mount it on the wall. There also seems to be slots that might be designed for some kind of stand, but my package didn't come with a stand that fits in the slots.Besides all that, it seems to offer good wireless coverage. I like the GIANT RED FLASHING LOGO on the top of it when the WAN is not connected to the Internet. That might be useful if I didn't have it tucked in a closet. I suspect that the closet will glow red under the door if the Internet goes out.The antennas are kind of annoying. You can stand them straight up pretty well, but if you lay them flat, they do not align vertically. You have to angle them to lay them flat with the unit. The power barrel connector seems small and flimsy. It operate at only 5 volts, so it's not very power hungry. I suppose that's nice.Overall, I wish I spent $25 more (almost double the price) for a better router from a known manufacturer.",
