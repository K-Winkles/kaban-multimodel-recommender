                "reviewText": "I bought a used 5th wheel RV last summer. I plan to live in it full time. Only one problem...the wifi in the main house (my roomie lets me use his for free) would never reach the RV. I spent about 6 months researching solutions and although this Wavlink product is pretty expensive it turns out I could not have done better.BE ADVISED...if you watch videos about how to set it up you'll see people attaching routers to their cable modems and running LAN cable through the walls and crawl spaces and buying expensive mounting arms and so on and so on. YOU DON'T NEED ANY OF THAT IF YOU WANT TO BRING WIFI TO AN OUT BUILDING!You do need to run the setup wizard from the location where you most want the wifi and pay attention to all the possibilities. I didn't the first time I tried to setup the repeater and thought I was in for a major hassle. Then I sat down and patiently went through all the screens. Bingo! Five bars of pure, clear, steady wifi. The trick is to refresh the available networks until the one you want shows up with even 1 bar. The setup will tell you that the signal is very weak. Ignore that. Input the password for whatever wifi signal you are trying to reach and the repeater will create a good, strong connection by adding a short extension to the network name. To use devices in the outbuilding, be sure you connect to the new extended network. You'll use the same password as already exists for the network.My RV is about 250 feet from the original cable modem and this model has no problem providing excellent signal. It's range, in feet, for those who don't do metric easily, is 650 + change. I can now be connected anywhere on a full acre.",

                "reviewText": "Very happy with the range I get out of these. I have the \"typical\" rural setup. One device is on the house, wired to my main router, the other is on the barn (300 feet line of sight away), to downlink to attach to my solar electric monitor.At first, was having issues getting it to assign IP addresses on the barn access point. No matter what I tried, it did not seem to work correctly. Had plenty of signal, but was not assigning addresses correctly.Contacted customer support, explained the issue (and, pro tip, here) included screenshots of ALL configuration screens. \"Jason\" replied the next day suggesting that, since I was configured as a , I should set the \"Repeater Mode\" in the wizard to \"Bridge\", as opposed to \"Gateway\", which is opposite of what the UI in the config suggests. Once I did this, all is working as expected, and I have full connectivity now in my barn, just like I had run a wire between them.",

                "reviewText": "Update 8/14:Dead WiFi. So the short version... It was powered on and was working and then no WiFi....unplug and reset....no go. Spent a good 2 hours working through it and can connect via Ethernet cable and the unit is responsive (including firmware update without issue) but end result still no WiFi. It could find the signal I was looking to repeat, but that was about it. Conclusion I something broke. Needless to say it made for a trip to be annoying WiFi wise and have already gone another route.Update 7/21:So have had a few more outings and it continues to work well. This last weekend out garnered a few laughs. While paying for our stay another guest complained that since someone else was in the way, they cannot get a WiFi signal and had a rash of theories as to why it was \"actually that way\". For me, it was the same... signal went from 86% repeat strenght to 0% as there was a loss of line of sight at the distance we were staying.....except I simply moved the unit about 20' that had a better line of sight -- and went from no signal to 100% repeat strength. I still have to add in some more mounting options, but for now... it continues to be exactly what I was looking for.Overall it works great. A few caveats...but was what I was looking for. The unit is dead simple--- plug in...log in...run through the wizard...done. Almost done.So that is the simple answer...now the caveats. I use this to pick up a WiFi signal and repeat it. This is why it is designed to do. The issue is every time I go somewhere else, you have to run the wizard....you just can't pick a new signal from a scan to repeat, enter the password and retain all of your settings for the back end...you have to re-enter. That said sometimes you have to scan 3-5 times to find the WiFi signal you're looking for if there are a number of them around. So that leads to a huge plus that balances that...it creates a private LAN. The advantage is I can connect my devices and nobody else can see what I have connected. I wish it had more security protocols and that you could scan and enter a new WiFi signal password without running the wizard.With this being my first weekend out with it... I am pleased. It mounts easily and now I just have to make provisions for the wiring on a more permanent scale. Right now I have been streaming with a ROKU for 4-hours straight without a hiccup and have two phones connected as well.",

                "reviewText": "First off could not get it set up with the ethernet cable it came with, wouldn't even get power. Tried a new cable and no issues. Is kinda a hassle to set up. Worked for a few months grea, easily got 100' of signal. Then the poe it came with shorted out. Contacted wavlink about it and sent pictures of a literally melted poe and got no response back at all. Tried to buy a new poe and could not get it to connect again. 2 stars for faulty equipment and bad customer service. Will be looking into buying something else just not from them. Would of given 1 star but it did work well when it was working.Edit*- after the review customer service reached out to me told me which replacement POE would work and had me order it and after confirming the unit worked with the new Poe they would refund me the cost of the new poe. Edit to 4 stars for good customer service. Look forward to using the wifi extender again.",
