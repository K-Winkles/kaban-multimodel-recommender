Even in the back bedroom, the wireless signal is still 85% as fast as if you're sitting in front if it. The gig ethernet works great on the devices I have plugged in and it was very easy to configure using my phone.Zero problems and couldn't be more pleased with this thing. Spectrum, on the other hand, and their 1990s technology leaves a LOT to be desired but I'm stuck with them. Looking forward to moving this summer to a place that offers anything other than Spectrum's 20+ year old infrastructure.",

Not understanding what was happening, we unplugged it, waited, then re-booted it. It always came back to a functioning level. When this kept happening, we re-booted both the router & modem. Then we began calling our internet provider & working with them re. what was happening. We even had service calls @ our house from our internet provider. They provided a new modem, replaced some connections, verified that the signal was good from the pole to the modem. And then 2 days ago, the router completely stopped working. Again, I reached out to our internet provider, they checked everything again. The router could not be brought back to life. To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement. I did my research prior to purchasing & thought I'd bought a reliable product. Went back to Netgear today.",

For the most part, it did function well, but lately the signal to my Roku was not strong enough to prevent occasional freezing. Interference from my neighbors wifi was also contributing to this problem. I figured I needed just a little stronger wifi so I bought this router. It appears to have solved the problem and every device connected, even the N and AC devices, now have significantly faster connections. It is also a bit more of an intelligent system, able to analyze the wifi (by using the Linksys app) and picking the best frequency and channel automatically (my old router usually required me to decide which settings to use, which I had periodically change due to the neighbors wifi changing channels).Setting up did require multiple attempts to connect to the router using their app, but after a few reboots of the router and modem, I finally connected and the rest was fairly easy.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this model instead of the pricier 4-antenna one after I discovered the other 2 antennas are only for the 6 GHz band. Our ISP configured it for us, we plugged it into our shiny new fiber internet interface box and it worked. We're only paying for 30+ Mbps service so router bandwidth is \"who cares\", and the wif-fi strength seems fine in our building where it matters. If it lasts, it's a success.",
