I purchased this Linksys router and it has solved the speed problem. Setup was easy. It took about 45 minutes from unboxing to enjoying high speed internet. Setup was easy. The phone app did all the work. The device os not bulky. It is small and sleek. It has it's place on the top shelf of my shelving. The signal travels all through the two-bedroom house, the back yard, and almost all the way to the carport, which is pretty far away. Newer routers are too expensive for me, but this one was the right price. Excellent value.",

Another issue is the user interface in the web app that feels underdeveloped. The older versions of the web app didn't look flashy but were much more functional. Also the list of connected devices doesn't update in real time and only shows 1-2 devices as online while there should be at least 10.",

You have to go on-line to download the guide which turns out to be for cell phone setup only, not direct cable setup. Lastly poor support. The person I was speaking to was in another country using poor English. He was reading from a script and I could hear the other so-called techs talking with other users with problems. He then laid the phone down on his desk and walked away while I listened to the other conversation. I gave up and hung up the phone. My internet provider was able to walk me through the manual setup. Great job. But the router still is weaker than my old Asus. The route is only 18 feet from my computer.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had Linksys routers for over 4 years. I just got this for an upgrade from my last. Set up was a breeze. Just need to download the Linksys app (I already had it from last router) and go from there. Took about 10 minutes if that. Great connection, easy set up and works wonderfully. This is a mesh version which can connect with other Linksys routers in the home to increase efficiency or you can use it as your main/only router. Would definitely recommend for the price!",
