I set them up myself (millenial\u2026 familiar with tech but not outstanding) in less than 20 minutes! So far, we\u2019re on day 3 with these and they\u2019re definitely worth every penny. The parental controls feature on the app is so great and extremely customizable (with no subscription required). I can easily add the members of my household, assign their devices, pick an age level, customize bedtimes, and more. Our house is very wifi dependent, so I needed something reliable and strong. We all get great service throughout the house and it\u2019s so much easier than switching back and forth manually using an extender. Another added bonus is the aesthetic design of the devices. They\u2019re definitely more modern and better looking than our old router with tons of long antennas! As long as these continue to work well, they\u2019re the best purchase we\u2019ve made in a very long time!",

My dad spent two 12 hour days on it before we called technical support. Tech support was friendly and knowledgeable but they couldn't figure out the problem either. I spent 2.5 hours taking screenshots and emailing them proof that it wasn't working. We tried reseting the devices, different laptops, trying different devices as the AP and client. Finally tech support said they had to refer us to someone else.At this point I had the system for 3 weeks. I couldn't wait for them to figure it out and get back to me as my 30 day return window was approaching.I returned them to Amazon for a full refund. I feel the worst for my dad. He was racking his brain for 2 days trying to set this up. He is very patient as I was pissed enough for both of us. It was a waste of time. YMMV, Good luck.",

Solo baj\u00e9 la app de la marca, me registr\u00e9 y segu\u00ed paso a paso la instalaci\u00f3n, es muy sencillo, adem\u00e1s tiene control parental y opciones para mandar a lista negra dispositivos que no reconozcas y est\u00e9n usando el internet y algunas opciones m\u00e1s.",
