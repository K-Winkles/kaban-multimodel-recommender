This device worked like a charm and was up and running in 10 minutes. Plug the transmit end into a router port, take the recieve end near where you need internet, allow the two devices to sync, use the provided wifi SSID to connect to the reciever device. I'm not sure about the speed of the connection as I'm only using this to connect to a wifi connected sump pump for status updates but it works as described where others did not. Great product in my opinion.",
