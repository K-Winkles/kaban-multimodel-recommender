But as I\u2019m desperate to protect my expensive router I\u2019m dealing with it. I have nighthawk router with 4 antennas for reference. (In pictures) it was super easy to assemble and I had to hang it upside down by turning the brackets around in order to do so. One side has multiple holes and the other has a long hole. My antennas only fit through the long side. Hence why I had to flip it. However, it works amazing. It holds the power strip my small modem box and my router! Pictures of the mess I was dealing with before and after I put it on the wall!! I love it!! Works great and no more mess.",
