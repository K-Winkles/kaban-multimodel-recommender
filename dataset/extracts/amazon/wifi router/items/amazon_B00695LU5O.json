                "reviewText": "I upgraded to the E1500 from a 1st generation Apple AirPort Express 802.11n and couldn't be happier. Although the AirPort Express was 802.11n, I was never satisfied with the range and speed. I've had bad luck with other brands in the past, but the refurbished E1500 was cheap enough to warrant a gamble. Since installing, it's been rock solid and fast. I opted to forgo the Cisco software and configured the router with the web based setup. It's played nicely with all my devices and caused zero headaches. I stream HD to 2 Apple TVs and have 10 other devices logged in, but the router doesn't flinch.Don't spend more unless you really need it. Dual band wireless routers are overated as the 5ghz spectrum doesn't provide great coverage. For most homes, this router will get the job done.",

                "reviewText": "Installation was a breeze although it took me a minute to realize that there was a guest option. Because I gave this router the same name as my prior one I was confused. After fooling around, I realized this was a guest feature so that I wouldn't have to give my actual access point password. This is akin to wireless access at a coffee shop or a Barnes & Noble store.After installation, everything worked wonderfully except for streaming videos online, which was a major headache. I don't know how I stood after 2-3 weeks of frustration. I had printed the return label and was so ready to send it back to get something new when I stumbled upon the review section and read several similar observations/complaints. Some reviewers swore to never get a refurbished item again and I almost aligned with them. However, the trick is in the QoS default setting. After I disabled WMM, wow, man oh man, the streaming speed and downloading/uploading were breathtaking! It's a shame such a great product comes with that option enabled. So here's what you need to do:1. Go to router's IP address, which should be something like [...]2. Click on Applications & Gaming3. Look for QoS settings4. Disable WMM Support5. Save and Continue6. You're in business!!",

Their site states that it supports the firmware, however I have not tried it yet.The router is ok. Had a few minor issues with the router stalling. This might be due to us having more computers connected to it than it is rated for.Also noticed that wifi slows to a crawl if b/g/n is enabled. Had to disable wireless n for older devices to not get terabad transfer speeds (~1Mbps wireless lan). I think we're currently getting 54Mbps over just g.Other notes:-No mounting holes on the back. Our old router was mounted on nails. This one does not have holes to mount the back, however it mounts well on mounting tape. Its been up for about a month so I'd say its up there for good.-Worth it at the refurbished price. I got a similar router (forgot the serial) for my parents for about double at Microcenter. They have no issues with it. Although they only have 2 laptops, a Roku, and a printer hooked up to it all using wireless n or ethernet.I'll update this review after trying 3rd party firmware.",
