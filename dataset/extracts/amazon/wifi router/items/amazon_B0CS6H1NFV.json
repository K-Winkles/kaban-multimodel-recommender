It is very easy to set up and the instructions include well-designed pictures as a guide for each step. I currently live in a lovely camper on my family lot, but I couldn't get a strong router signal and my laptop would often lag. I purchased this and had it installed in the actual camper in less than 10 minutes. I can now get a very strong Wi-Fi extended signal in the camper. I put this in the camper and have a signal to reach it (not a dead zone) and I'm up and watching shows and doing homework super fast and without interruption. Also, living in this camper, my space is very limited, but as you can see in the pictures, it doesn\u2019t take up much space! For my time, money and results, this purchase was a great solution! With this extender, I have a great connection and am very satisfied. I highly recommend this Wifi extender.",

                "reviewText": "It has been, by far the best product I\u2019ve purchased in a very long time. I would highly recommend this booster to anyone who is trying to boost their signal. The WiFi extender works as advertised, and is easy to set up and immediately use. Package looks nice and is not a cheap cardboard box like most products have. Instructions are clear step by step details making the process of syncing with your wireless router ridiculous easy. This device has provided strong signal to all my devices and those of family and friend who visits.",

                "reviewText": "I have really spotty Wi-Fi in some areas of my home which causes me to have trouble connecting all my devices because my router is too far which made it frustrating. I decided to give this Wi-Fi extender a try for that reason and I don\u2019t regret it. It was so easy to set up! Clear instructions and not a lot of steps. The previous extenders that I have had in the past didn\u2019t even work well and would not even connect to my baby monitors. This one has had no trouble in delivering fast internet connection and I can have internet anywhere in the home and not have to worry about where to set up my devices. It is also compatible with all my devices. It has a nice design that is not bulky or ugly. Wish I ordered this sooner! Shipping was super fast.",

                "reviewText": "WOW! This PALEOER Brand is a fine Internet Repeater (Extender). I needed better WIFI coverage on the South side of my property and this unit does a great job extending my coverage and it has a very strong signal. My computer, my wife\u2019s computer and my TV are all on the PALEOER REPEATER and signal is maxed out. It was very easy to setup and the instructions were written clearly. It Complies with IEEE 802.11 B/G/N standards, Supports Wireless Security: WPA/WPA2.Which means you are secure from hackers. It can also be used as a Repeater/AP/Bridge/Client/Router Modes to meet different demands easily. I highly recommend this repeater to anyone needing more coverage within the home or outside the home. The PALEOER Repeater is outstanding in every way. It gets 5 STARS from me.",
