                "reviewText": "I have tried numerous wifi \"extenders\" over the past 5 years or so, and none of them worked in contrast to the product claims by the manufacturer. I recently upgraded my router to a TP-Link AX21 (AX1800) wifi 6 model. I get great coverage inside my home, but venture outside onto my terrace and its signal could not produce a reliable connection. I was contemplating scrapping the router and going with a mesh router with satellites. But I just bought the router, was happy with it overall and I paid $100 USD for it. Then I began my search anew for an extender that would work with my router. Then I found this little baby for $70 on Amazon. I decided to give it a try, especially given Amazon's liberal return policies. I received the unit quickly and decided to pair it to my TP-Link router via the WPS mode. I plugged it in near my router. Step 1: press the WPS button on the router. Step 2: within 2 minutes, hold the WPS button on the extender for 2 seconds. Step 3: wait up to 2 minutes for pairing to be complete. Well, it worked flawlessly. I moved the extender to an AC outlet next to the door leading outside. I now got full wifi signal outside in either 2.4GHz or 5GHz. Also note, 5 GHz is great unless it is restricted by walls. So in the past, any signal I did receive outside had to be 2.4GHz. Now I can use either, and the connection strength on my iPhone 12 mini is great outside the house. Pages load instantly. YouTube videos stream flawlessly with no stuttering or lost connection. I could't be happier.Please note that the AX 21 TP-Link router has a design feature they call One Mesh. This extender also supports One Mesh. So unlike the extenders I have tried in the past, this extender maintains the same router channel name and SSID. So roaming is a seamless experience. I advise anyone looking for a good extender to consider this unit. But research is needed to make sure this extender is compatible with your router. I bought this extender because it specifically states it is One Mesh, and even bears the moniker \"AX1800\", undoubtedly with reference to my TP-Link AX1800 (AX21). Always choose an extender that allows for maintaining the same router channel name AND SSID. Other routers also have a feature to mesh with their extenders, so start your search there. Hope this helps!",

                "reviewText": "I am absolutely delighted with this router and recommend it highly.First, it was quite easy to install. There was minimal difficulty in connecting with the modem. The instructions on the app are intuitive and clear.Second, the router is reliable. I've been using it for several weeks and have had good results, including when resetting the modem.Third, the router has good reach. It works well across two floors.In sum, this is a very fine product. Thus far, it is ihe best router I've used and the price-point is reasonable given the high quality and reliabiility.",

                "reviewText": "NOTE: The RE600X extender has a very long reboot time, at least as compared to the old TP-Link RE220 extender it replaces. About 4 minutes. I initially thought the unit was defective because the power LED would flash forever, but it's just a long reboot time span with this unit.Upgraded our home WiFi from the old workhorse combo of a TP-Link Archer C7 (v5) router and TP-Link RE220 range extender (OneMesh system enabled), to a WiFi 6 setup with a TP-Link AX1800 (Archer AX21) router and TPLink RE600X range extender both purchased via The TP-Link Store here on Amazon.So far, very satisfied. The router was easy to setup. The range extender setup was also easy and uses the same layout as the RE220 it replaced so it was a familiar setup. To test the RE600X I checked WiFi connection speed on my Samasung Galaxy Note 20 5G (a WiFi 6 device) while about 7 feet (2.1 meters) from the extender. 1.1 Gbps !! Impressive, but that's also pretty close proximity. House is 1800 sq ft single level and the router is in bedroom at one corner of house and the extender in kitchen at the opposite end, so they are about the diagonal breadth of the house apart. Coverage is excellent. I would have to run a LAN cable to living room to locate the router more centrally (which admittedly, is ideal) but as it is, the opposite ends of house arrangement the router and extender are set in covers the premises with enough throughput such that we're getting about 185 Mbps on internet speed tests if a device is midway in between the router and extender, that's with 400Mbps broadband service. WiFi in general just tends to murder your subscribed Mbps speed rate you're buying from your ISP the farther you get from the router, at least on this middle tier class of home router. The extender is intentionally on kitchen exterior wall that faces swimming pool area outside. The old RE220 was getting signal to the pool area but about 50% strength. Haven't gone out there yet to test if the RE600X extender is exceeding that, but confident it probably is since it solidly beats the old RE220's performance inside the house.",

My router is getting 600mps and in the room where I have the extender I\u2019m getting about 450-500mps. My ping is at 10-15 and no lagging for gaming. Downloading games is fast too. Like I said Ethernet cable probably cat6-8. But overall I recommend this product if you\u2019re having wifi trouble in the house.",

Este equipo tiene la opcion de onemesh, que te permite unificar tu red con diversos extensores y que tus equipos se conecten al mas potente para ellos.Es muy facil instalarlo, en cuestion de 10 minutos ya esta listo y funcionando.Desgraciadamente el onemesh no funciona tan bien y los equipos se conectan indiscriminadamente a cualquiera de los extensores y al router principal. Con esto a veces la conexion se realiza al extensor mas lejano, bajando el rendimiento.Ademas de lo anterior, la potencia de estos equipos es mas baja que el RE650, estando pegado a ellos, no logran sobrepasar 200Mbps de conexion, cuando el RE650 alcanza los 500Mbps en mismas condiciones.Si la veloidad de tu red de internet es menor a 200Mbps, tal vez te funcione sin mermas en velocidad, pero si es superior a eso, jamas lo alcanzaras con este equipo.Ademas es mas caro que el RE650.",
