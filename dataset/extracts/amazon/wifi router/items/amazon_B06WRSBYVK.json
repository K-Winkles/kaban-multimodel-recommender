                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Like everybody, my needs have changed over time",
                "reviewText": "As an IT professional, I have tried hundreds of combinations of routers and switches and wireless AP's. Like everybody, my needs have changed over time. The kids are old enough now to be using the internet, the house is getting smarter all the time, and even my television comes in over the web now. After exhaustive research and feature and price comparison, I decided to move on to the Deco m5. I was using a cisco asa firewall and cisco 3900 series switch with a netgear router in AP mode before, but it lacked the ability to easily implement parental controls. I get annoyed with the kids for staying up late playing on the internet after we go to sleep. I un-boxed the deco m5, very nicely packaged by the way, to find everything in order and ready for install. I powered down my firewall, called the ISP to have the IP address released, (I work for the ISP, so that was convenient) and got the router plugged into the internet connection. I am fiber to the house, so I don't have a modem. I had already installed the TP link app on my galaxy s6, so I was ready to get started. (Everybody else was at work/school so no complaining about the lack of internet while I did all this. YEA!!!!) The app found the deco with no issues and ran through the VERY basic setup process. Everything immediately came up and worked. I have 80 meg service and speedtest.net was reporting 82.7 download consistently over wireless. I started playing with the app, and under the advanced tab is an option to check for updates. I clicked it and it did indeed find one. 5 minutes or so later, the led indicator on the router went green again. This is where things went a little sideways for a few minutes. I spent the next 10 minutes losing and gaining wifi on my phone, and had to force stop the app a couple of times. Everything else in the house seemed fine, it was just my phone. I have six echos/dots in the house, and they all came right back up after the swap out. The echos/dots are usually the problem children to get connected after a power outage, so I was suprised. My wink hub didn't even seem to be affected. everything was functioning normally except the stupid phone. A quick restart on the phone seems to have fixed it. I did have 2 of my 5 wink relays lose connectivity, but I think they may have already been disconnected. A quick restart fixed them both. I plugged the second port into my cisco switch and all my wired devices reported for duty. Next step was to walk to the far corners of the house and run speed tests with my phone, which was still giving me pause because of its recent bad behavior. My home is 1400 square feet, and about 4 years old, with tech shield in the attic. (the aluminum foil looking coating on the inside of the roof decking to block the heat) wifi seemed to be great everywhere with speeds at maximum in every corner. (I bought the single Deco m5 unit) The router is actually in the garage in the corner for now, so it will probably cover significantly more ground once located in the center of the house. Next step was to setup parental controls. Yeah, this is the good part, talk back to me one more time you obnoxious little turd. Setup the profiles and went hunting MAC addresses. The only downfall to the process was finding all the mac addresses. Nothing has a logical name in the table you are looking at, everything just says \"android\" or \"amazon\". I started with \"amazon\", and that is when it hit me. I opened up my alexa app and went to settings, and then to devices. At the bottom of each device's settings page is the device's mac address. I found my trusty pencil and an envelope from some junk mail, and my list was soon made. You can change the name of the devices in the table on the Deco to recognizable names. I then went to the android devices and PC's. That was a little more time consuming, but not too bad. Next, assigning who the device belonged too. You do that at the bottom of the device settings page, just make sure you have already built that person's profile. When you set up the profile you give them a movie like rating system, and can disable or enable various types of websites or specific websites. Next option is setting time limits for daily usage, and last is setting hours to shut them out completely. Kids got pg-13, adults get \"adult\". Now that that's done, time to explore. I knew it was \"alexa\" enabled, so that was next. Honestly, don't waste your time. Alexa can do very little besides run a speed test and change the led's status. I was hoping to pause the kids internet just by telling alexa, but that is a no go for now anyway. It also cannot control access to wired devices with parental controls, so if you want to disable the kids smart tv's, make sure they are connected wireless. I probably should have given 4 stars due to the setup issue with the phone app, but everything is just working too good now. the parental controls shine, and the wireless connection seems to be rock solid. Only major negative I will give it, you cannot change it's lan IP address yet, but I have read that this feature is in the works in a future update. If you have anything set static on your current network like I do, you may have to change some IP's in a few devices. (Cameras, network servers, stuff like that) I only have a few devices like that, so I can handle it, especially for the price I paid for this. Overall, if you are on the fence, this is a great little mesh system. I wish it was POE powered and wall mountable, that would have made it perfect, but I guess it can sit on top of the fridge and do its thing. I'll update if anything changes, but I don't suspect I will have any trouble. Oh, and for anybody who is wondering, it does look like you can manage it remotely, as I can log in and change settings right now while I am at work. That could be handy for pausing the internet to make sure the kids do their homework before I get home from work, or to make sure they are doing their chores on time. I wonder if that will work with the old lady too???",

                "reviewText": "i had just tried the Orbi system and what a nightmare, it kept dropping signal and devices. I was a little skeptical with this system because i thought it being so small and simple it wouldn't work....i was wrong!This wifi system replaces my aging Apple extreme. I had 2 in the house, one in the office and one in the family room. In the office i got 150/150 but the further away it really dropped low. I was only getting 30/30 with that system in that room and it was time for an upgrade.The setup is super simple, you need a smartphone and download the Deco app. It walks you through the entire process. It shows you how to plug everything in and then pick the room that unit will be in(for id purposes). Then you can name the wifi and select your password. Its not pre programed like others.I have the 3 unit system and i recommend that everyone goes for this and not the single unless you have less than 3 rooms or small apartment. The reason is (and you'll see when installing the system using the app) that it works best when you have them within a certain distance of one another.This depends on your house but spreading them out will help keep the signal strong and then get higher download and upload speeds as well as eliminating dead zones. Think of it as when you drop a rock in a pond and you get those circles...the closer to the smaller circles the better. Of course you don't want them right near each other that was just my explanation.So, i have the main in the office where the main fios router is, then i have one downstairs one room over from the office, then the third in the next room to that (this is how you keep the wifi strong). The coverage is strong and i have full wi-fi bars on every device no matter what room i'm in.Once you have all 3 Deco's connected (and for each the app asks if you want to add more) it will go thru its final setup and mine had a firmware update. It will run diagnostics and also give you a speed test. The closer you are to the main the higher your speeds will be, i have 150/150 Fios, and in the office i get 149/151, furthest away in the family room (where the 3rd Deco is) i get 66/58 on my laptop and iPad 62/51. The downstairs fluctuates 3-5 but is pretty consistent.I have my fire tv hooked up directly to Deco #3 via ethernet cable. I get fast streaming so there is no issue. I have 2 wireless printers and no slow downs.Super happy with this wifi system so far and its also smaller in size and the price is fair for three units. It has all the current specs, 2.4 GHz Radio Frequency, 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, 5 GHz Radio Frequency.It also has guest networking so you can have guests get wifi but not your personal passwords, parental control, antivirus. It also has QoS which lets you prioritize which devices get top priority on the wifi network.",

                "reviewText": "I didn't realize when I bought this that one Deco would always have to be connected to my router via ethernet in order to function, so that was a disappointment. I live in a ranch house, my router is in the middle of the house, and my plan was to put a Deco at either end to better manage devices, but having to have an ethernet connection scrapped that. Maybe all mesh works that way? I just expected that the Decos would connect via wifi, but it makes sense that you get better coverage with ethernet.It does do a better job at handling device traffic than the router alone. We have wifi cameras, plugs, and lamps in addition to phones, tablets, PCs, etc., and using the Decos increased device capacity, and it seems to be easier to maintain a strong signal no matter which end of the house I'm at. The app is pretty basic, but has some useful controls for managing device access, assigning priority, and isolating devices from each other if needed. It's kind of slow at times to respond, and occasionally it takes a while for a device to show up as active when I know it's connected. I do like that it shows usage for individual devices.",
