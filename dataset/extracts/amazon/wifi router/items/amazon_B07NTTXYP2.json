                "reviewText": "Updated 5th January 2022: Initially the router was advertised with RouterLimits basic offering included. It worked for a couple of years, then RouerLimits basic offering went away, and I was left with either paying for RouterLimits or not having it. I see that from amazon.com features list, they've now removed this feature (free basic offering), however for a while it was there, while the feature did not work without additional payment. Now it's advertised as a feature that you can sign up and pay for and works with the router. IMO it is a similar feature to the TrendMicro offering that's included with many Asus routers, and some TP-Link routers. Other than this, so far, in home setting this router has been amazingly reliable.---------------------------Like:1. Simple dual WAN load balancing with common sense options built-in2. Plenty of gigabit Ethernet ports3. Only rack-mountable router with built-in WiFi 5 that I have found.4. Range great for wifi 2.4 and 5-1 (1733 Mbps)5. Price is affordable for home use in comparison to other products and comes out of the box with way more functionalities ( e.g. VLAN tagging, WiFi SSID to VLAN mapping, tri-band WiFi, easy Dual-WAN load balancing, subscription option for router limits IPS)6. USB 3 port for add-on storage7. Open source OS with potential for after market firmwareDislike:1. Range useless for wifi 5-2 (866 Mbps), unusable even at the end of a long open room (no interference 50 away RSSI shows -65), no signal in a different room (range is less than Bluetooth 4 even in open area)2. Router Limits basic was offered as built-in free feature for life when I purchased the router. Apparently the life ended, and this feature is no longer there. Paid subscription option for Router Limits is still available. While the basic option was available, I've used it and found it quite reliable/usable. I have not tried the paid subscription version.3. No option to use DFS4. No option for LAG (8x 1 Gbps ethernet ports)5. Software hard to use, shows lots of errors in the log but no way to resolve those6. Updates are rare and hard to come by (seen 2-3 updates so far that didn't add anything new, fixed security vulnerabilities albeit quite late)7. USB port cannot be used for LTE backup.",

                "reviewText": "I set this up via an Ethernet cable plugged into one of its 8 LAN ports. Very easy to configure. Located the administrative settings and told it to update its firmware from its mother ship. Worked fine. I have two ISPs; the failover is the entire reason I moved onto this router.Bonus is that when you change network settings and the device restarts, it reconnects to WAN and its WLAN clients quickly.",

                "reviewText": "Great router for MultiWLAN or Multihoming but you need to update the firmware and you need to do it via a wired connection. The router kept disconnecting for me, just randomly softbricking and needing a reset until i updated the firmware now it's fine.It's going to need some configuring and it's not a \"gaming\" router so the options aren't apparent. It'll start by being configured with connection 1 as default and connection 2 and fallback. I leaned towards having both connections up and \"load balanced\" giving me the combined download/upload of both. I have spectrum and Starry. Spectrum 400dl 20ul / Starry 250dl 250ul and this router manages to get my overall connection to 750dl 250ul which is the reason I wanted it in the first place.There's a pretty extensive vpn feature built in but the media share feature is kinda broken.Solid kit but needs a cs degree to set up",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Router is okay, but has some flaws",
                "reviewText": "I purchased this router to use in my home network hoping the wifi signal would be stronger than the consumer routers. I was sorely disappointed. The wifi barely reaches my second room. I live in a ranch-style apartment that is only 1054 sq ft. It has the same issue with wifi that my old router had. The second bedroom barely receives a 2.4 signal and the 5.0 is abysmal. In addition, there is no web filtering ability other than signing up for Router Limites (either 10/month or 99/yr). I called Trendnets tech support to verify this and that is what they said. I'm keeping the router because I think it's possible due to the construction of the walls that the signal doesn't reach well. I tried two other routers and same issue. But now I have to find a firewall appliance to do some web filtering.In addition, I cannot use the USB port to use my phone as a backup connection. I tried to use a USB C to Ethernet but currently Android only allows data in through USB Ethernet, not data out. Android 11 seems to bring this functionality to the OS, so hopefully, I will be able to connect to the WAN 2 port to set up failover.Overall the router is okay, has some good options, and feels well built, but there are some definite improvements that need to be made.",

                "reviewText": "I need a small business router... and the TEW-829DRU (aka AC3000) router is marketed as exactly that: \"SMB.\" I'm sure the wi-fi features are impressive, but that's not what makes an SMB router \"exactly that.\" It's the filters, the VPN, the firewall that set a good business router apart from just another souped-up high-bandwidth wi-fi transmitting (i.e., WAP) box that is called, rather broadly, a \"router.\" Sadly, the aforementioned business-like features are weird to set up, compared to industry peer equipments, and in the case of IPSec VPN Site-to-Site, DON'T WORK. The User's Manual gives sparse example of set up but it's between two identical routers. In this industry, VPN edgerouters of every make and model are supposed to play together nicely. Ironically, an older Trendnet router (TWG-431BR) did so easily... but had OTHER fatal quirks. And there is no VLAN Access Control List, per se; you have to use IP filtering as a work around... and then debug what should have simply worked.",
