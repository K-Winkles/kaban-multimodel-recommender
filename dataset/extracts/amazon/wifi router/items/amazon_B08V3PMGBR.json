Found the Netgear Nighthawk mesh WiFi system on sale a decided to pull the trigger. Very happy with the easy setup, the performance and the extended range from my previous modem/router combo. I have my PC hardwired into one of the satellites and I am getting the max ISP speed that I\u2019m paying for. Have close to 20 devices connected between phones, computers, tv\u2019s, etc. I am getting consistent download/upload speed in every room, where before with my previous WiFi router/modem the performance would vary greatly depending on where I was. This is a major upgrade and I would highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "For those who are unable or not ready to upgrade to Orbi, this may be the next best option. I needed a quick, yet solid and somewhat modern solution to pair well with a Nighthawk CM2050V Xfinity modem with voice services. This solution provided me the Wifi 6 platform that I wanted for modern Wifi devices in our home ecosystem and the flexibility to segment our IoT and computer devices from Guest Access. So far, I am pleased with the performance and consistency that we needed. This serves as the interim solution until symetrical fiber is deployed to our community in the forthcoming year. The coverage and connect speeds are good in any room of our 2,000 square foot home. The router and satellite are small and were easily hidden out of view while maintaining a good signal throughout the single-story building. I don't see a need for an addition satellite at this time, as signal strength is excellent.",

                "reviewText": "When I received this product it set up quite easily and the wifi coverage was excellent. It wasn't long, however, that I noticed the satellite (MS60) was having problems. Over several days I corresponded with Netgear support until I was just fed up with spending all of my time troubleshooting and having my wifi down half the time. I arranged a replacement through Amazon while I reinstalled my Linksys wifi router. A new system arrived in a few days which I set up in parallel with my Linksys system allowing 48 hours before proceeding. After making most of the required settings for my network I further tested for another 24-36 hours. The system is now online and is performing quite well. Several problems have cropped up since coming online. Firstly most of my attached devices had some problems reconnecting which did not happen the first time around. A problem which is being widely discussed in the Netgear Community is the inability to have separate SSIDs for the 2.4 and 5GHz wifi bands. This 'feature' is intended to make the reconnecting to either band without intervention as portable devices like your phone or tablet are moved around the wifi mesh. The problem comes when you have devices that only operate in the 2.4GHz wifi band. Many do so because the 2.4GHz band has a longer reach which is important as many of these devices are located in diverse locations around the home where there are intervening walls. Many of these devices require an app on a phone or tablet for their setup and require that device to be connected to the 2.4GHz wifi band which is not possible in the current design as phones and tablets are designed to connect to the best available wifi signal and I have found no way to change this behavior. Certain apps claim to be able to do this but none have succeeded on my devices. Some have suggested taking your phone or tablet to a location where the 5GHz signal is weak causing the device to choose the 2.4GHz band. This almost works but on my devices the connection dithers between bands while attempting setup of the intended device. My solution was to use a TPLink wifi extender from my shop building which only operates in the 2.4GHz band. I moved the extender into my house and set it up with a distinct SSID which I use exclusively to connect to my 2.4GHz only devices like my Ambient Weather weather station, my MyQ garage door controller, and my Sonoff TH16 remote temperature sensor. I know Netgear has been swamped with requests to change this behavior if possible and I await that although at this point my current solution may be a better one. All in all Netgear was responsive, at least in the way that all of these tech companies are responsive, i.e. \"yes I already powered it off and stood on one leg and swung a dead chicken over my head\" and all of the scripted suggestions that you get.",
