                "reviewText": "It is so great being able to move all around the house and not have to wait for (or have to force) the connection to change from one router to the next. The mesh networks I looked at were really expensive but then I found the refurbished item at $77 for a router and 2 satellites.The set up via the Orbi app was quite straightforward. I was able to just plug in the cat 5 cable to the router to connect it to the cable modem and power up the router and satellites. I skipped part of the instructions to power down and power up the cable modem and disconnect all other devices. I did power down and disconnect the WIFI access point whose SSID I re-used for the mesh.There were a few times where the orbi app required you to go to wifi settings and reconnect to the network to finish the setup. These times include when you 1) change the ssid from orbi_setup to your preferred ssid, update the admin password, and update the firmware to the latest version. There might have been a time or two where the app seemed to be spinning its wheels and touching the screen may have (perhaps coincidentally) snapped it out of its navel gazing and moved it to the next stage.All in all happy with the result. The speed is decent and the coverage is robust. We have a chimney in the center of the house that is opaque to WIFI and I was able to completely surround it. The speedtest function in the orbi app is a bit too optimistic on the download speed but seems to match other measures vis-a-vis the upload speed.I have other access points for things like cameras, sensors, and \"smart\" switches/outlets that needed the 2.4 GHz band so I didn't have to spend twice as much for the refurbished 3 band mesh unit and could stick with the two band unit (5 Ghz for user access and 6 GHz backhaul circuit for the satellites.)",

With the Orbi router and two satellites strategically placed there is now great service, not only inside the metal bus and trailer, but all over my one acre property! I'm delighted.",
