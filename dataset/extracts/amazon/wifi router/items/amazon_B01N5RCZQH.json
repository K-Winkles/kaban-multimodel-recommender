                "reviewText": "I travel for work. So I am in hotels often.I LOVE the ability to plug a gadget in, and point it to the access point, and have all my devices automatically connect up. This was necessary to satisfy the problem of Google chromecast, where it requires a phone to operate, and they must be on the same wifi network. (Most hotels isolate devices to keep guests secure from each other)I bought the small nano first. And I later purchased the larger version (TL-WR902AC). So I will provide the pros and cons of each here.Please also note that I am EXCLUSIVELY using this in hotels in wi-fi only (never plugged in the RJ-45 ethernet) as a wi-fi access point for all my tech, I've not used it for anything else. There are many other features and capabilities that are not accounted for here.Nano: + simple setup, great wizard. + SOOOOO tiny + Works great with Marriott/SPG hotels (and everywhere else I've tried it) - Struggles with multiple devices, the single band antenna seems to be a big restriction in speed and multiple devices. - Slow speedsBig brother (AC902 model) + Much cleaner and more stable connections - handles all my devices brilliantly. + Far more features (that I don't use) + Larger than the nano (picture for reference) but still so small that it's perfect for travel - Setup is not so streamlined. Additional hardware toggle on the device makes it more confusing. (I use the middle setting, \"Share Hotspot\")Side-notes: I used this exclusively at a single hotel before upgrading, so the differences noticed between the two models were all at the same property. Both devices get a bit warm, but nothing concerning, and it's not at all surprising given how tightly they are packing them. Both are small enough that the only reason I would recommend the nano over the big brother is if you need something to fit in your pocket, or purse, and don't have high expectations in terms of speed.",

The installation process was relatively easy, and I have been pleased with its performance thus far. One notable advantage is its compact size. However, it is worth mentioning that this travel-router requires a constant power connection and does not have a built-in rechargeable battery.",

                "reviewText": "What a piece of junk. I bought this because I wanted a media server for my VR headset. There is a USB port for this exact purpose. First, you need to know that this reviewer is a computer guy of 40+ years. Setup was a bit difficult, but after an hour it was up and running. After a week, the nightmare began... Fail#1: One evening, I went to watch a movie and EVERYTHING was gone -- all 300GBs just vanished into thin air. The drive had been wiped out. After days of data recovery attempts, I recovered a small portion of the content. Fail#2: I decided to use my expensive USB SSD to store the media. All went well for a few days ...until I wanted to add some more movies to the SSD. After removing it from the router, it would no longer work properly on the laptop. I could only move about 1.5GB at a time before it would lock-up the SSD. After several hours of messing with the destroyed SSD, I gave up on it. Fail #3: I had an old 300GB USB HDD that I filled completely with content. And guess what? The router wouldn't locate the movie folders on the USB HDD drive. After wasting even more time, I guessed that it might have failed to locate my data because there was a small 9GB empty non-active partition on the drive in addition to the main partition. What a dumb limitation. Arrg! Windows had no issue recognizing this USB HDD drive, but the router could not. So now I'm sitting here writing this review while I'm reformatting and reloading the entire 300GB of data on the third drive yet again. If this router eats this third drive, I will update this review. The lessons I learned are that you should NEVER connect non-backed-up data to this router, and never connect an expensive SSD drive to this router. I honestly wish I had never purchased it.UPDATE: My 300GB drive is going to be too small for future use, so I purchased a new 2TD USB HDD. I formatted it and loaded the 300GB of data, and the router did NOT see the data. Really!!?? After some more experimentation, I decided to reformat the USB HDD with the 4096 format allocation unit size (which is crazy inefficient for large media files), and the router DID find the files! So, I writing this update while yeat again moving the same 300GB of data yet another time! To save YOU some time, here a quick tip: **Do NOT format any USB drive with any other allocation unit size than 4096 if you expected this router to be able to see the data. Or at least, format your drive with a test folder to see if this router can see it before dedicating all the time to load the content. ** Here's hoping this is the final saga in this sad story.(not so) FINAL UPDATE: Well, everything was great - was able to watch some movies!! ....until this morning, when the media server \"just quit\" in mid-movie. The WiFi bridge was still working just fine, but the media server magically disappeared. So, I was faced with the difficult decision of either returning the router to Amazon or experiencing the massive joy of taking a sledgehammer to it. But alas, I took the responsible route and am returning it to Amazon. After all that has happened, I didn't want it to damage my sledgehammer also! In all fairness, if you don't need a media server, and NEVER intend to connect any USB drive, you should be very happy with this product -- the Wifi was rock-solid.(another no so) FINAL UPDATE: Well, I THOUGHT the media server \"just quit\", but actually after moving the USB drive back to the computer I realized that this absolute POS router killed a BRAND NEW $70 USB DRIVE at the hardware level. It no longer spins up. Arrrg! It just gets worse...THE FINAL UPDATE! The nightmare is over! Just received my RavPower (ironically, the same exact model number, scary, aye?) and got everything set up and running as a bridge and media server in under 10 minutes! Super happy again!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this item to allow for better WiFi coverage in my home. My router is in the basement and, although it is mounted in the ceiling in a central location, I do have a few spots where the coverage could be better. I also have numerous security devices outside that drop signals because the are too weak occasionally. This tiny router plugs into my ethernet switch on the main floor and the signal reaches every corner of the house from that location. The setup was a snap. I chose ethernet to Wifi, logged onto the router via the web portal provided and completed the ssid setup in just a few minutes. Once I gave the SSID unique names to differentiate between my existing router and the auxillary one and between the 5G and 2.4, I clicked save and was done. I use the same passwords for all my LANs except for the guest portal so switching my devices is easy as pie. I love the travel utility of this router also. I typically travel with at least 3 devices and if my wife comes along it can be as many as 6. Hotels tend to allow 2 per room so this will address that problem and provide a secure network at the same time. The reason that I did not give 5 stars overall is that I have fiber optic in my home and my speed is usually 170 mbbs or higher. This device claims to be capable of faster speeds by even hardwired is under 100 mbbs. Most people wont notice this or have an issue with it but, those that understand networking will might not appreciate the choking. That aside, the price, utility and ease of use make this a great value. I have to assume that those that gave it a less stellar review, are simply not tech savvy and did not understand how to set it up properly. I am very happy with the performance with the one exception noted.",
