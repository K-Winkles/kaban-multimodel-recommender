Half of my room is basically a dead zone, and my best floor lamp happens to be placed within that zone. So I was having a heck of a time with connectivity on the smart bulb. When contemplating what I could do to solve this issue, I decided to buy this extender and plug it in the hallway. Set up was somewhat easy, and is all done through the phone app. It did disconnect on me a couple times in the first couple of days but once I got it right, it\u2019s been smooth sailing ever since. I only wish I bought this extender sooner! Not only does my smart bulb work flawlessly, for the past few months since I made this purchase, I have experienced no less than 5 bar Wi-Fi signals and fast internet throughout every corner of my bedroom. Highly recommended.",

Extremely easy to setup, just use the WPS or Log Directly into it. I did both methods just to see how it would go, as I generally never use the WPS (EASY METHOD) of adding devices to my router, I had to go ahead and try it. Went so easy, so easy.But being a bit of a computer, networking nut, I still like doing things the direct hands on way, so directly logged in, very easy to navigate, changed that default security password jazz - DO THIS or anyone who sees these devices or any hooked to your system, will straight off try to log in to them and either hack you or just lock you out.Not to scare anyone, just keep that in mind with ANY electronic devices hooked to your network. Save yourself the heartache.That said, it's so easy to do or have a family member help you, but it is really very easy. read and follow the easy directions and you should not have any problem.My LinkSys Router used to (2yrs ago) delivered a 5 BAR signal to everywhere on my property (about 1/2 acre) but my house is only about 1850 sq-ft. Router sits in the farthest room from screened back porch. As I said, 2 yrs ago the signal was 5 BARS everywhere maybe occasionally at the farthest corner of the property I might dip to 3 but then zoom back up to 5 within seconds.That was 2 yrs ago, more homes have been built, more cell towers etc. So for the last 12 - 15 months, that great signal dropped to 5 BARS occasionally with 2 mostly or completely dropping signal altogether.That's some Big League Taboo nowadays, so that leads me to my purchase of the TP-Link AC2600 WiFi Extender(RE650) - Plugged it in at the opposite end of the house - In the Laundry Room. No problems. Solid Signal on both bands - never drops at all, not even a flicker. Fast transfer speeds, I upload / download photos and graphics to and from my place of work. No hick-ups, no more dropouts, just a solid enjoyable signal. Watch HD and some 4k videos over it without a bit of trouble.This device is top shelf in my opinion. You can set timers for when it shuts off and wakes up (when nobody's home) and can even set the led lights to always on, always off, or at a sleep/wake time.Yeah you can get cheaper, but that's generally a gamble with finding a diamond, usually you get what you pay for. Who needs that headache to save 25 or 50 bucks. Not saying saving some money is a bad thing, I like money too, work hard for it, so throwing it away is not something I do either, but if your internet and network traffic is important to you - why skimp. There may be better too, really just depends on how you use it.If you're a real Rockefeller Type, go for whatever fits your need. I just needed my strong signal and network/internet transmission speeds back to STELLAR.And STELLAR is what this 58 yr old kid got with this TP-Link WIFI Extender. Oh, and it comes with an Ethernet port built into it for direct configuring or getting even more speed out of it. I only used it for the direct login to the device and to upload a new update. That was easy peasy too.Oh, and it has 4 swing up antennas on it. Really nice device, just place it and forget it.Sorry for such a long winded review, but it is an honest one. Like I said, I have only had it for maybe 2-3 weeks, more 2 weeks. Will definitely update if anything happens to change it. FOR NOW IT'S AWESOME AND 5 STARS.Hope this was helpful people.Thanks TP-LINK. Very well done.",

                "reviewText": "I use RE550 extender in a wireless configuration, where it is located from ten-twelve meters from the main router. There is nothing between them, except two wooden doors and some edges of concrete walls. The internet speed is sixty Mbps download and upload.According to TP-Link\u2019s network settings, the signal between RE550 and Archer A8 seems to be hundred percent on 2.4 GHz, and almost hundred percent on 5 GHz. The Wi-Fi connection icon in the network settings sometimes shows the last bar gray, but most of the time it is full.The coverage is better than WA850RE by a lot, but it is not perfect. The 5GHz signal on Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 between two-three concrete walls and seven-eight meters is sixty-seventy percent.The repeater provides a constant internet connection to five portable devices and one wired device. There are no stutters when two phones and one smart TV play back one 4K HDR and two 1080p YouTube videos. Its workability around several devices is stable.The package and the product arrived without any physical damage or cosmetic imperfections.Unexpectedly, but after the last firmware updates the device works fine. Unfortunately, same can\u2019t be said about Archer A8 and C80.In almost all network configurations, the repeater/range extender is not worth it, since it does not completely copy and distribute the network like Mesh Wi-Fi devices. However, with a software support, which all network manufacturers put on their products (EasyMesh from TP-Link) it, is possible to use supported range extenders or routers as a Mesh Wi-Fi device. There are several downsides though. One of them is that you cannot form a network chain between all devices; other devices can only talk to the main router. If you can afford a Mesh Wi-Fi system device, it is worth more than any range extender.",

                "reviewText": "I have been using another Extender for a couple of years now, it works, but I the connection is not always stable or available for devices I need to connect outside, but it works 85% of the time. And I always have doubts or cannot always trust the extender always feed coverage / signal connections. I have tried 2 other products of extenders but they worked pretty much the same. That is why I thought...well, it's probably my problem how everything is constructed and lay out in regards to the areas I need to use this extender. So I have given up in trying to find something better because I think it's going to be pretty much the same results.So last week I finally decided to give another chance to look for a better Extender, I found this, but at first I didn't have much high hope, I would just try it and then refund it if the performance is not what I expected. But to my surprise, the signal is so much stronger providing VERY stable and solid connections ! Now I feel 100% with this extender providing solid connection, I can see my devices loading faster, and not drops at all, everything just work so much better now. Very happy. Now in my case, I'm not so much concerned about \"dead zones\" is more like I need a solid connection to where I need to use it and this extender performed just that, a solid connection. My internet connect is pretty solid so if the extender can extend it, then everything will be fine, again, this extender did a solid job in extending connection. I'm sure this extender can always broadcast a very long range of connection to help reduce dead zones/spots.Oh, in terms of installation/setup, I do recommend to use the \"Tether\" app to setup. It's easier for most users. But if you have experience with extenders, you can always connect to the extender network and use a browser (i.e. your phone, iPad, or even a computer) to configure and setup the extender. For me, I used the Tether app to setup the Extender, and I used the Tether app to check status of the extender but the browser offers you more options in settings (i.e. changing wifi passwords - you cannot do that with the Tether app). The instructions are all there in the piece of paper and it's not long so don't need to be scared, it's pretty easy. Just follow what it says. And basically you can just setup/configure using the Tether app but the app is 80 Mb so I might delete it and just connect to the extender and configure / monitor from a browser going forward (just need to save the URL on my browser)If you want to use the Tether to setup/configure this extender you will need (do it before you setup the extender):1. Create a d-link account (very easy, just need an email and create a password)2. Have a Password Handy for your Extender - make 1 up (You need to create a login password to your Extender - You don't want everyone to be able to connect to your Extender and mess things up right?) - you will still need this even if you don't use a Tether app to setup your extender.3. Have your WIFI password ready (the password of the WIFI connection that you want the extender to use). If you are connecting your extender to your router/modem directly with a cable, you do not need this but I think most people are trying to extender their WIFI connections wirelessly.Worth every penny imo, I got this on sale for $60 CDN + tax. . 5 Stars product. Good Luck and hope this extender will be the last one you need for years to come.",
