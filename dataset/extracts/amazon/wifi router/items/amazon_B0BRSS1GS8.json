But that's just on the surface, what I care about is my game speed being faster. Someone reviewed it and it broke after using it for 4 months But I'd rather play a smooth game for 4 months and then buy another than play a slow, freezing game for 4 years.

                "reviewText": "Fast but very unreliable router. After replacing my 5-year-old TP-Link AC1750 with the Tenda AX3000, I started experiencing the following major issues:1. Random disconnects in wired LAN connections, which will ruin any low-latency online gaming sessions as it takes a while to reconnect. Happens maybe once a day or so.2. The router stops connecting to any new Wi-Fi clients until the router is rebooted. This is bad because any computer or phone that is restarted can no longer connect to the router. This issue starts maybe after a couple of days without rebooting the router.3. Interestingly the router has an option to automatically reboot the router once a day, presumably to help with the issue #2, but after the reboot some of our Alexa devices do not automatically reconnect to the router, until the Alexa devices are rebooted too. What a pain.I would definitely return the device had I not waited until the return window had closed and may end up having to buy another more reputable router to resolve the issues listed above.Edit: Dropping the rating to 1 star after having to get yet another router just after 4 months. Even after a factory reset this router only works for a short while before dropping all wifi clients and refusing to connect new ones.",

Install was very simple and setup was simple enough for those with some technical knowledge.",
