                "reviewText": "The product is excellent, and the \"Smart Wifi\" app is actually quite intuitive, and rather comprehensive, given the amount if improvements recently made to the SOHO level products. I am currently very limited, given that I will have to replace my Linsys \"gigabit\" cable modem, since their \"gigabit\" modem is only currently at 100Mbps. Linksys's tech support, on the other hand, leaves a great deal to be desired. All but one of the people to whom I spoke were HEAVILY accented, and at least half of their sentences either have to be repeated, or must be deciphered against their (obviously) far-eastern accents. So much for \"American\" companies, eh?Internal throughput appears to be nominal, and in accordance with the device's specs. I will see what happens, once I've received my new cable modem.",

The configuration is pretty simple - i am having problems working with two of them cascaded - one facing the internet, the other facing it. I am trying to build a DMZ where i can open a network to the world to place web servers and then put my secure nodes behind the second one. The assisted config does not work well setting this up. I am planning to reflash it with a third party software.",

Any more than that and loading times get bad. Not a bad router for the price, you definitely get what you pay for but I would buy it again.",

By the time I got it, the issue was resolved, so I kept it in its box and moved out of state with it. Now in a new house, I had an immediate need for it. One of my original reasons to purchase it is that I assumed that it would wirelessly bridge with my existing network, especially given its price tag.I've spent probably 2 hours working with the \"Smart\" setup, struggling the entire way, only to discover that the the Wireless Bridging option doesn't exist. (Including creating a new account, validating it, but now it doesn't recognize my name/pass, and, if I request \"Forgot my Password\", no email is sent.... How \"smart\" of you.). Presumably, I can bridge via Ethernet, which is pretty useless to me.So, back in the box it goes, and I'm off looking for a much more cheaper alternative....",

I ended up calling Linksys and paying for the 6 month tech support rather than the two weeks.I have had the product for 1 month and had 2 tech calls and 3 drops in wifi service already. It keeps losing the IP address among being difficult to set up. I spent 2 hours the first phone call with tech support, 1.25 hours with tech support the second time, and fixed it myself the third time about .5 hours (day of this review) and am considering a new router for the future after spending $90 between the router on Amazon and the $40 of tech support if this keeps up. I had an N300 Linksys at home before this that worked great and use Linksys at work and have not had this problem. I recommend finding another product. On a positive It does work well when it works.",

I am on a 10Mbps Cable connection, and I am getting every bit of that at the end devices. Data transfer between devices is extremely fast (No, sorry I have not ran an internal speed test) but I can say that it is noticeably faster than the old N router was when it was new.Great router for a great price point. I know that there are newer and faster models available. I also know they cost between 4 to 8 TIMES the price that this one does. I cannot comment if this will work for the power gamers, but for the Netflix streamers, the iPad gamers, and the VPN, Work at home IT Professionals... It works just fine!The set up was also the easiest that I have ever seen for a wireless device.
