                "reviewText": "I have been using the Linksys MR7350 Ax1800 for a few weeks now. It\u2019s excellent budget Wi-Fi 6 With new features like 1024 QAM, that send more data with each transmission, and OFDMA, that manage simultaneous connections efficiently.The top speeds is 1.2 gigabits per second on the 5GHz band and 574 Mbps on the 2.4GHz band. I don\u2019t have internet that fast to test the top speeds but in a MacBook you can see the (Tx) transmission rate meaning your speed to the router, and it\u2019s 960 Mbps on 5GHz all around my one bedroom apartment.The band-steering option that lets the router automatically switch between the 5GHz and 2.4GHz bands for the optimal result can\u2019t be switched off. Anecdotally this feature works fine most of the time but in two occasions it didn\u2019t and it stayed on the less optimum bandwidth for a while before adjusting back. (I didn\u2019t realize it because of drop in performance but because I was monitoring and testing the new setup)The range is excellent for one bedroom apartment, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s suitable for large multi level homes because it barely works at the end the hallway of my apartment building which is all wood construction. The iPhone app is intuitive and works reliably.Overall it\u2019s a great option (I bought mine on sale) and I would recommend it for one bedroom apartment with many devices. It works great in my situation with around 10 devices including Apple TV, MacBooks, NAS, handheld and HomeKit devices.",

                "reviewText": "This requires you to login only through the app - no logging in directly into your router. Want to change your dhcp settings or add a static IP address you have to login to the router through your Linksys web account, then it is supposed to scan for your router and THEN you\u2019re supposed to be able to change settings. It shows up in my phone but never shows up on my account- says it doesn\u2019t detect it.I can\u2019t set up my camera system, I can\u2019t add a LAN to LAN connection because this whole system/process takes away control from the user as far as I can see. Also, logging into one\u2019s router through the internet through another website (Linksys account) seems risky and insecure enough. Why add this extra hurdle.No thanks. If you\u2019re grandpa I guess this router would work for them just fine.Router looks nice but wasted my time.",

                "reviewText": "Had been having problem with Verizon Fios wi-fi in my upstairs room and sometimes on same floor as the router (other side of house) Reception would come and go. reliability was often poor. Had an older linksys that had used but similar reception issues. Tried all the channels, moved antenna, no luck. Decided to get a wi-fi 6 device and see how that worked. Found this router at a very good price. Setup was quick and easy. You do need to use the app on your phone for the setup but I don't consider that to be an inconvenience. The features on the app provide a lot of info in addition to the setup. My wi-fi connectivity issues were solved soon as this unit was setup. Have reliable coverage all over the house with most locations getting speeds same as if laptop were plugged into a wired connection. Was well worth the purchase.",
