                "reviewText": "A little bit larger (taller) than I expected but it has a very small footprint especially considering it has replaced two pieces of old equipment. I have one computer wired to it via ethernet cable and another connected wireless.Getting the computers set up and on the internet was very easy. (My internet provider is cox. Was able to set up the new modem with Cox on-line. I set up the modem/router; Connected the wired computer; Computer immediately recognized the internet connection; When I went online, I was automatically taken to the Cox website and set up the new modem with them.)However I did have a problem with getting the modem/router to recognize my network printer that is also wired to the modem/router via ethernet. I went to Netgear's chat support and a wonderful woman spent an hour and a half helping me to get the printer working. Turns out it wasn't a problem at all with the router/modem. It was a setting on my printer that needed to be changed. The fact that she helped me resolve the situation when it had nothing to do with their equipment was way above and beyond the call of duty that I normally expect with customer service now-a-days.My phone (Samsung S5) and tablet (Samsung) connected easily. My phone is actually able to connect using the 5G capability of this modem/router. My tablet apparently doesn't have the 5G capability but connects with 2.4G.The computer that is connected via wifi also doesn't support 5G. I have to go buy a new wifi card if I want the 5G. However, I don't think I will. I'm getting plenty of download speed with the 2.4G. I went from a download speed of 11.90 Mb/s to 31.94 Mb/s. This is a huge increase and I can feel it. The speed of the computer that is wired to the modem/router didn't change (download speed right around 33 Mb/s). This leads me to believe that Cox has limited my download speed to about 33 Mb/s with my current plan despite them saying I should be getting 50 Mb/s (but that's an issue I have to work out with Cox). In any event, I don't see any point in buying a 5G wifi card for my computer to only possibly get an extra 2 Mb/s more speed.All in all... Very satisfied and I highly recommend!",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars AC1750 with Time Warner Cable",
                "reviewText": "Just a little background, I work in IT and I am very familiar with how routers, modems, and network services work.I purchased the Netgear AC1750 since it was under $200 and wanted a router that supported IEEE 802.11ac while also getting rid of Time Warner's modem to get rid of the monthly modem charge (which I find ridiculous in the first place but that's besides the point). Both the AC1750 and AC1900 but the AC1900 was quite pricey and didn't think I needed the latest and greatest (boy would I regret that decision). I purchased this on December 2015 so had the device for almost a year.Day 1-Received the device and had issues activating it. It took me almost an hour to get the device up and running without even getting to the settings of the device to get it the way I wanted to. After that I setup my devices to reserve specific IP addresses because I use an app called Simple Control where I control most of my home theater setup. Once I started getting more devices connected to it I wasn't able to get internet anymore. I factory reset it and tried it again but of course after the factory reset for some reason it wasn't activated again so I went through the process again but this time took 30 minutes. Once that was done I started setting it up again and then when most of my devices were connected AGAIN I was seeing issues. I did it again and connected only devices that I needed to have connected. It was stable so I went to add some port forwarding options which then I ran into it not working. It would just connection timeout which I then looked up and saw it was an issue with that firmware. Now comes the fun part of reaching out to Netgear and trying to find a solution.After troubleshooting they finally put me to a Tier3 technician which they tried to punt me to Time Warner saying it was something on their side which I knew wasn't the case but I went along with it. Time Warner did their changes on the backend (spoke to their Tier3 technicians as well) and they did notice abnormalities as there was a newer firmware but my device wasn't getting it. They sent a tech over and no problems were found and tech even combed through the hallway to see all the wiring to see if that could be it but everything was clean. Went back to Netgear and said everything was clear but was still seeing issues so they sent a replacement. Received the replacement and of course the same exact issues were happening and couldn't get a firmware update. Netgear then sent another replacement but with the newest firmware which was much better. I could add port forwarding rules, adding all my devices didn't cause the router to quit working, and initial activation took 20 minutes. Even with those fixes I was still seeing errors in the event logs and the device would act very abnormal. Accessing Netgear Genie was very slow, couldn't update applications while connected to wifi on my Android and iPhone, and when I rebooted the device it would take 2-3 reboots to get all my devices to reconnect and my devices would try multiple times to reconnect and stay connected. Also after a week or 2 I had to reboot because the router would just stop functioning properly. I couldn't keep a stable wifi connection, transferring files over the network would be extremely slow, and I couldn't keep a stable network speed externally. I told Netgear about it again (I was troubleshooting the device for over 9 months with Netgear at this point) and told them if they could give me the AC1900 (I actually asked before they sent the 2nd replacement) and I would pay the price difference which they came back to me with a no and to do a factory reset again. At that point I just stopped responding and gave up with them since rebooting the device every 2 weeks didn't seem so bad.The reason I wrote this review is because Black Friday/Cyber Monday rolled around and I had the AC1900 saved in my cart. I noticed it was $180 and having not purchased anything figured I would buy it, try it out, and if I see the same issues I would just return it with no troubleshooting. All I have to say is WOW it's a huge difference. Activating the modem took less then 5 minutes, I was able to set it up almost entirely the way I wanted to right from the get go (for some reason when I was adding port forwarding rules they would not appear but that resolved itself after 24 hours), no errors in the event log, and rebooting had all my devices connected in 1-2 minutes.I regret not getting the AC1900 right off the bat since it was only about $100 difference but with purchasing both devices instead of being out just $280 I am not out almost $500 just to get the $7.99 monthly charge out of my bill so will take me 5 years to catch up on that cost for it to have been viable. Lesson learned and hope this helps other people.",
