Some heat up like a toaster like AX3000 and some don't have the processing power i.e. the required number of CPUs to quickly process the packets by 20+ devices. Further, some are $300+ which kind of brings the affordability into play.This router however finds the right balance in all the features which I was looking to upgrade. I was looking in the range of about $100 and tried to AX3000. However, it heats up too fast and then starts to thermal throttle the speed and doesn't even stay connected with the clients like a laptop or mobile devices. I have tried a Netgear router from Costco AX4300 but fall short when around 20 devices are connected to it and don't support the mesh networking.Features which I wanted and like:Range:This device has a superb range by itself and covers my home pretty easily. I see I have a good wifi signal at all ends of my home and I live in a 2-floor apartment with the router placed upstairs.Mesh:I like to receive a good network in my backyard as well and so I have added a RE505X which costs another 80 bucks but saves money on my mobile data plan as I don't invest in an unlimited data plan. There is only 1 SSID that is broadcasted and it automatically switches based on where I am in the home.Heat:Some routers heat up and create a fire hazard and also have the probability of breaking down sooner than I like them to. This is not the case with this one and it stays relatively cooler and never experienced any slowing down of the network. I have touched it to check several times and it's good.Setup:The setup was really easy. The basic setup can be done in minutes and there is no RnD required. The tether app is pretty cool for basic setup. I also have requirements for static IP based on mac address and port forwarding. Both of them are easy to configure. They also have support for dynamic DNS so you can easily host your basic website in your home network. For this, I need static IP address reservation and port forwarding.Parental controls:This is a real plus that allows me to block youtube or any site whenever I need to get my kid away from the TV.Reboot schedule:I like to have a reboot schedule which is good this router has it and very easy to set up.LED lights:This router allows to turn off led lights and I like it that way once the setup is complete.Summary:I think its a router for average home with right balance of ease of use and price and features.Note: I have not been paid for this review and have bought the router with my own money.2 Weeks Update:Going strong with over 20 devices connected, no disconnections reported by anyone in device. I have 3 heavy internet users at home. No heating issues, range is good.4 Months Update:Working perfectly for 4 months. No issues.2 year updateStill works as new with no issues",

                "reviewText": "The TP-Link AX5400 is a WiFi 6 router with dual band and long range wireless capabilities. Also known as the Archer AX73, the WiFi 6 technology allows this product to achieve speeds up to 5400 Mbps as a theoretical maximum. Even though actual speeds will probably be lower than that, it will still be fast enough to perform bandwidth demanding tasks such as large file transfers over the network or Ultra High Definition streaming on your local home network.Installation is super easy, it\u2019s basically plug and play. You connect the router to your internet modem, and then connect your devices via the WiFi networks. The A5400 will come with default wireless settings, including a predefined network name and password, for easy initial setup. It is strongly recommended to change these settings to your own, for security reasons. Management can be done either via the smartphone app or (very happy about this one) the web interface. More about that later.Aesthetically, you will notice that this router has a rather interesting rectangular design, and it is equipped with 6 (!!!) antennas. Yes, you read that right: 6 antennas. TP-Link claims that this supports large wifi coverage and good signal strength to all devices with their beamforming and 4T4R technologies. Even though I have no practical way of measuring the performance of these technologies, I can attest to the fact that the AX5400\u2019s coverage is excellent and I didn\u2019t notice any dead spots at home (including the devices located outside my home, such as wifi cameras and doorbells). In case you do experience dead spots, you can add an extra TP-Link mesh device compatible with the AX5400 to solve the issue. I talk more about mesh networking below.One of the major features of the AX5400 is mesh networking. Mesh means that all your routers connect with each other, forming a mesh of coverage rather than having one router that acts as a single point of connection. Your wireless device will always connect automatically to the mesh router that provides the strongest signal. This is called Roaming. Much like in telecom/mobile networks, your Wi-Fi devices might change positions and move around your house. This means that the wireless signal between your device and the router gets weaker with distance. With mesh routers your device will automatically connect to a different router unit that offers a stronger signal, without interrupting the running service and streams. This not only increases the coverage vastly, but also offers seamless handovers and transitions of Wi-Fi services as you change your position in your house. In other words, you get Wi-Fi Roaming capabilities that will vastly improve the reliability of your wireless connection. That, of course, means that you need another TP-Link mesh capable device to achieve this functionality. TP-Link provides a list of mesh devices compatible with the AX5400 on their website.So far I have no complains regarding the AX5400\u2019s performance. The Wi-Fi is very quick and outperforms my internet connection. I haven\u2019t noticed any issues with latency either. One remark I want to make here is that, even though older WiFi cards will still be able to connect and operate with the AX5400, you will need a Wi-Fi 6 compatible wireless card to make the most out of the mesh system. Making the most out of it doesn\u2019t mean that you will experience speeds close to 5.4 Gbps. These speeds are a theoretical maximum, they are achieved in the lab and they are impossible to see in the average home network setup. You will see, though, very high speeds depending on the quality of your wireless card (in my tests, I used the TP-Link WiFi 6 AX3000 PCIe WiFi Card), the distance from the router and the obstacles that separate you from it. Bottom line: it\u2019ll be fast, but be realistic with your expectations.But probably one of the things I\u2019m most happy about this router is the availability of a web interface for management. Being the owner/user of the otherwise great TP-Link Deco system, one of my main complaints was the lack of a web interface for network configuration. As a power user, I find it hard to configure my network equipment via the small screen of a smartphone. You can access the web interface by typing the router\u2019s management IP (you can find it listed as Gateway on your computer\u2019s network settings) in your browser. You\u2019ll have to first set up a local password (or create an account with TP-Link) before accessing the router configuration.Once you log in, the first screen you\u2019ll see is the home screen, or a summary screen if you like. You can see the internet status, the router status and some shortcut button to common functions, your mesh devices (if you have any) and the connected client devices. This last bit is quite interesting, since you\u2019ll be able to see the connected devices, their real time speed (up/down), the interface they\u2019re connected to (ethernet, 2.4G or 5G), their \u201cnegotiated\u201d max bandwidth, how long they\u2019ve been connected to the router and, finally, a \u201cblock\u201d button to deny the device access to the network. Below, I\u2019m going through some of the functions that I find interesting, but I will omit the ones that are so common you can find them virtually in every router out there.On the Wireless screen you\u2019ll find your WiFi settings. You can turn on or off OFDMA, TWT, Smart Connect and, of course, the Wireless radio itself. OFDMA (simultaneous transmission to different devices within the same transmission window) will significantly increase the traffic speed with compatible devices (your device must support OFDMA), TWT will help increase your device\u2019s battery life by maintaining the connection with the router and allowing the device to go to sleep (aka not forcing the device to send keep alive messages to the router too frequently), while Smart Connect optimized the connectivity of the router\u2019s radio bands with the client devices.TP-Link offers a security platform with the AX5400, similar to what they offer with the rest of their flagship devices, HomeShield. The user will get some basic functionality out of the box, and additional sophisticated features and analytics are available with a subscription service.The last screen on the web interface is the Advanced screen, where all the advanced options are located. Power users will definitely appreciate some of these. The first thing that caught my eye was Lan \u2014> Link Aggregation. You can aggregate (combine) up to two Ethernet ports into one (logical) network port, aggregating their bandwidth as well. Of course, you\u2019ll need to aggregate ports on the other end of the connection as well, but that is the other side of the problem. Pretty cool. The router also supports direct DynDNS logins, for those of you who still use a DynDNS client on your computer. Another cool section is Routing. You can use your own static routes defined in the router\u2019s config if you need to direct specific traffic to specific destinations. Use this only if you know what you\u2019re doing, otherwise a bad routing config will probably block your access and traffic. The router comes with a USB port, which is nothing unusual. What is very cool, though, is the fact that the USB port supports (except for mass storage devices) Apple\u2019s Time Machine. Just connect a storage device to the AX5400\u2019s USB port, enable Time Machine in settings, and voila! No need for one of those old Apple AirPort Extreme routers anymore. NAT is, of course, present in this device as well, for your port forwarding needs. Security features include a Firewall, ACLs and MAC spoofing protection (by binding IPs to specific MACs). You have your standard VPN server built in, supporting both OpenVPN and PPTP, IPv6 support for you dual-stackers out there and a bunch of router Admin features (firmware update, backup, remote management, system logs etc.). Last but not least, you can switch the mode of the device between a Router (the device will route traffic and provide routing services) and an Access Point (the device will become a wireless gateway for clients, but you will need to connect it to a router for routing services - this is used mostly to expand the WiFi network).Overall the TP-Link AX5400 WiFi 6 router is a great home routing device and a strong contender in this segment of products. I\u2019m very happy with it for the time I\u2019ve been using it, and I definitely recommend it.",

Can limit a connection or block right from my phone and even if not home I can control the router. This might not be good enough for a very serious gamer but call of dutyand any race game I have tried have worked perfect. This is likely good enough for 90% of the homes.
