                "reviewText": "This works great for my needs. Extremely easy setup, and the Tether app works great.Had a garage door opener that mysteriously dropped off my 2.4GHz Wi-Fi after several years of zero problems. Couldn't get it to reconnect to my wireless router despite my many years of network configuration and troubleshooting experience.Took my Wi-Fi analyzer out to the garage and discovered there are a ton of neighboring Wi-Fi networks causing interference on all 11 channels in all directions, so my regular Wi-Fi signal was dropping. Figured I'd need a stronger signal from an extender as I wasn't ready to buy another router just for the garage (too big and more $$$).All I needed was this small extender set inside the house near the garage and the signal to my garage door opener is back to excellent. Zero problems. It has not impacted my network speeds on my regular Wi-Fi SSIDs, as I tested profusely with speed test apps and sites.After the initial set up close to your router, make sure you reposition this extender somewhat close to HALFWAY between your wireless router and the end devices you want to connect. Too far in either direction and it won't give you the desired results. Think of this extender as a relay -- it's only as good as the signal connection it has with BOTH your wireless router and the end devices you want to connect.This is a great extender for medium to lower bandwidth-using IoT and other devices. Sure, it's still using the older N and AC protocols, not AX, but the speeds it produces for me are plenty sufficient for these needs.Works flawlessly with an ASUS AX router. Getting very usable and sometimes even higher speeds through this extender than from the router at the edges of the house. Able to stream video and audio without any problems.There is a recommended firmware update available for this extender, and you can use the Tether app to update the extender very easily.Can't beat the low price on this one either. Very cheap and elegant solution that actually works. Really liked that it automatically added two more SSIDs, adding \"_EXT\" to the end of my existing SSIDs (Wi-Fi network names).",

                "reviewText": "This product says it can be used either as an extender or as a wifi access point. It was very straightforward to get it going as an extender, and it worked well. However there weren't really any clear directions on how to get it set up as an access point--it referred you to a website that doesn't have the directions. I ended up giving up and using it as an extender, for which it works well.",

                "reviewText": "I am writing this review because so many people are giving it a bad review because frankly they do not know how the technology works. First off it is a signal extender and not a booster, meaning it will extend the signal you have but it will not increase the speed! The speed is only as fast as the signal coming into the house to your router! In my case I was not getting a good signal to my Ring Camera because the signal was not strong enough! You basically put the extender between where you are getting a good signal and where you want the signal to extend too. For example I used a speed tester app to find the best signal in between the router and where the signal is going!I have read several comments that say you need to understand how it works and doesn't work. First off if you don't know how the technology works then you don't need to be writing a review. Other reviews said it creates a second SSID and they keep getting disconnected switching between the router and the extender! I will say this it was super easy to install just download the app by scanning the QR code in the instructions manual. Once the app is open create an account and follow the instructions. YES by default it creates a second SSID!Here is were you have to understand the technology. If you don't want certain people for example to have access to the extender you can have a second passphrase so that only people you want to have access can. If you just want to extend the network throughout the house you have to name the SSID the same as the router SSID as well as the passphrase. What this will do is when you move into that part of the house your phone will automatically switch to the closest signal which is the extender. Yes you will be disconnected from one and connected to the other, but because the SSID and passphrase are the same for you it will be instantaneous! if you are listing to music or watching a video because of the buffer time you will not have any loss of service!In conclusion It is working as intended and doing what I needed it to do. I have a 200mbps connection from the cable company and I was getting 7mbps at the camera and now I am getting 65mbps and the camera is working so much better! The reason I am only getting 65mbps is because although the signal strength is better it's not 100% full signal. I know their are other Extenders with better range but most of them have external antenna's and I was putting this in the kitchen and wanted it to look as neat as possible for my wife.",
