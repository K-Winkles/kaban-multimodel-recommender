        "description": "Wireless-AC for Faster Speed and Reliability Upgrade your wireless home network and enjoy faster speeds than conventional wireless-N using the AC900 Dual-Band Smart Wi-Fi Router from Linksys. This router offers wireless-AC technology, which delivers a faster, stronger Wi-Fi connection ideal for online HD video streaming services. With speeds up to AC900 Mbps (N300 +AC565), wireless-AC provides gigabit Wi-Fi speeds that allow content to download faster. Wireless-AC makes it possible for you to stream shows on your HDTV while family members download music or other files--without interruption due to a slow network connection. The AC900 includes a USB 3.0 port and four gigabit ports to let you connect multiple devices, allowing you to quickly print, share, and store content across your network. Beamforming Creates Stronger, Faster Connections The Linksys AC900 Smart Wi-Fi router features beamforming, an innovative technology that optimizes the wireless signal strength between your connected devices and Linksys router. Beamforming enables the router to identify and connect directly with other devices, rather than simply sending out wireless signals in a general direction. The result is faster network speeds, better wireless range, and reduced interference from other devices. It also helps extend the battery life of connected devices and reduce their power consumption because data is transferred more quickly. Manage Your Home Network Remotely with Linksys Smart Wi-Fi Using Linksys & family of wireless-AC peripherals, you can take full advantage of the improved speed and stability of wireless-AC. Linksys Universal Media Connector lets you connect wired devices such as game consoles and smart TVs to your Wi-Fi network and stream HD or even 3D HD video content. The connector operates on the 5 GHz band, resulting in less interference and a clearer signal.",

                "reviewText": "I've had one of these for 3 months and it has been rock solid. It can't be beat for the price, assuming you get a good one. The cloud setup is a little unsettling (what problem are they solving exactly?) but it works. I get 867 Mb/s connections on a MacBook Pro, mostly because my neighbors don't have 802.11ac routers yet. In three years when Belkin decides it isn't making any money and the new buyer of Linksys discontinues the cloud service, I'll probably feel like I got my money's worth and also feel cheated at the same time. Why worry about the future when there's enough to worry about today?As an aside and in response to another review, no third party router works with Comcast for long -- it's a PC or the highway if you don't lease their router. Non-approved MAC addresses (fixed endpoint identifiers assigned to each manufacturer) are alternately ramped down to near-zero bandwidth or excluded from Comcast's ARP table, meaning no connection at all. Basically anything other than a PC or a Comcast router is useless. You can complain until the cows come home and it doesn't make a bit of difference. So I use Windows with Internet Connection Sharing as a router and save the $10/month rental fee. At least until CenturyLink chooses to rewire my neighborhood.",

                "reviewText": "I had the urge to get a new router to replace my 5 year old Netgear WNR2000.I had high hopes setting this one up that I more bandwidth and better connectivity through my entire home. I can connect to the 5 year old router anywhere in my home, but after setting up this router the first thing I noticed is the signal was much worse on the 2.4GHz band. Ridiculously worse! there is 30db less at only 10' away. One the second level of our home it was nearly nonexistent with 2 of our wireless devices unable to connect at all. This was never a problem with our old router. I thought about just getting a repeater for the upstairs until the next issue showed up.Stability? My old router was rock solid, but this router was constantly dropping out while streaming through wireless. This is something I am not accustom to and I was amazed how much worse this was than our old setup.I had high hopes. I was excited at the prospect of having dual band, gigabit, USB (for a network storage device) and more bandwidth for streaming through my ever growing network. The ridiculous lack of range and stability with this router are far too sub par to be adequate for wireless streaming. Bad enough it drops out when you are surfing the web and you have to wait for it to reconnect, even worse when you constantly lose your movie streams.I couldn't tolerate this any longer. I'm returning this router tomorrow and diverting back to my old router. I can live without gigabit and dual band for now to have a router worth connecting to.",

I like the new interface, although some settings seem \"buried\", but you get the hang of it if you access it enough. You CAN log into this without a \"Cisco Smart Wifi\" account, so don't let other reviews say you can't. There is an option on the main interface page to \"log into router\" AND an option to log in with Smart Wifi. It may have been a past practice of Cisco to require a Smart Wifi account, but with the latest firmware, I can tell you mine does not. I took off one star because the range is only slightly, if at all, better compared to the Netgears. I would have thought the antennas would be better in a Cisco.",
