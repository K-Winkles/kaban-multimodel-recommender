For 3 days I worked on this and tried for hours on end to make a connection with customer support. Automated voice saying you were second in que. You get this message twice then they disconnect. I have Starlink Internet and I could never get it to connect. I couldn't get updated firmware because I couldn't set it up. Advanced computer skills MIGHT get further with this but I personally think that the lack of customer support makes it uselessAfter a request from the company to try this product again, and with their guided help through Amazon messaging and personal help through one of THEIR support staff's FB connection, I was able to connect the repeater and it is working great. I have tested it through a power failure and it reconnected with no issues and the extended signal seems strong and consistent.",

I ran 300 feet of cat 5 from inside the house and was able to locate this extender within 150 ft of the end of my driveway due to the routing path of the cable. It works but both devices are giving me alerts that the Wi-Fi signal is weak. I was hoping for better as it advertises 3000 sq ft coverage. I suppose its within that but not optimal. I can't give 5 stars.",
