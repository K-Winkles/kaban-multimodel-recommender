                "reviewText": "I needed to replace a very old router for the upstairs of our house. The speed of the old router was pretty slow by today's standards, and we were losing connection quickly going downstairs. I was feeling a bit of sticker shock as I looked for a wifi 6 router we could use, until I found the TP-Link. We've had it for about a month now, with no issues, and fantastic download speeds, matching the top end of what our internet service claims to give us. It has also been great for wireless use of our Oculus Quest 2.The most difficult thing for our specific installation was that we needed it to be installed as an additional router to our network. The trick to doing so turned out to be setting it to \"Access Point Mode\" (System -> Operation Mode). Oh, and you should plug the ethernet cable from your base system into the blue uplink slot, not one of the wlan slots (which my old router used).",

I'm able to receive a relatively strong signal despite being in the \ud83d\udd25 hot attic. It has its own subnet via Vlan, which helps to keep my less secured devices isolated, IoT, from interacting with other more secured devices on my LAN. It appears that tp-link has improved the firmware. It's now more informative & easier to navigate. Since it's a refurbished device, I had to factory reset it & update the firmware. It was easy peasy to set it up. Warning, it's not plug & play... it comes with no instructions, therefore, less experienced users may struggle to set it up. It has been working flawlessly for almost two months. It appears to be new, no scratches or dents, despite being an Amazon renewed device. Overall, this is a great little device as an AP for the money.",

My home network is somewhat complex, with a spectrum of different devices, the need for 2.4g and 5g connectivity, and with various other technical considerations which I won't get into here. So I needed to find an inexpensive, separate router that I could handle my requirements while fitting in seamlesslessly with T-Mobile's service.This router works exactly as expected - has all of the features I need, straightforward to set up, and, as a refurbished device at a refurbished price point, it looks just like new and offered excellent value for the money. Just provide the ethernet feed from the T-Mobile device, log in,, perform the customization, and it's good to go.",

Since it is refurbished, I could not login to setup the router as the password was changed, so I factory reset it. Once in the setup, I found that the firmware was ancient, so I updated it to the latest version. After that, setup was a breeze. Gave it to a friend to run a combination for SOHO work, streaming and gaming. The router is fast, quiet, and does not get hot.

                "reviewText": "This router is a completely worthless piece of junk.My devices that have logged into the network with the proper password will randomly at times be unable to connect and tell me there is no internet network connection. I check the app and supposedly it tells me everything is working normal. I disconnect from the wifi and re-enter the password, it will show I have a WiFi connection but still no internet connection. The problem was only solved if I unplugged the router, changed the network name and password, and reconnected. Even then my devices would only remain connected for around 24 hours then would consistently loose internet connection again. This is unacceptable because I have a wifi based security camera system, so whenever this piece of junk disconnected my devices I would not have home security.I never write reviews but am pleading that anyone who reads this please do not waste your money on this absolutely terrible product. I wish I could give it 0 stars. Completely worthless trash and garbage product. Terrible.",
