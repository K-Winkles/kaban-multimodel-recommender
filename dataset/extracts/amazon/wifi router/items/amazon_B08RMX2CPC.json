The biggest gripe I have is no access to setting a static IP address. And, once installed, I don't know what the unit's IP address is. In my router I see the unit (no IP address shown), and I see the IP address of the device connected to it (Solar Controller). If I want to change anything in the unit I have to do a power reset and start all over again.When first installed, I was not getting a good signal at the unit from my main router. Yet it was close enough. Finally figured out that the unit was too close to a wall wart power supply. Once I moved the unit it gave me a green signal light.It does work but I have no metrics on how well it is working. This unit replaced a DD-WRT160N bridge which finally gave up the ghost. Guess I was spoiled with total access to the 160N on the fly.If you don't need access to any info then this should work for you. If you do not get a green signal light, it might still work. Try using an extension cord and find a high location for the unit away from eye level plugs and power sources.",
