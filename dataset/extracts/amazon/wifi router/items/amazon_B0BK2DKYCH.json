                "reviewText": "It sets up nice and easy over wifi from phone. Customer service seems great. I bought to increase my wifi to the back yard. It's winter here so haven't used back yard much. It has both 2g and 5g and option to use Lan cable to give stonger range I believe. The speed my regular wifi currently 64 mbps and extender 13.1 mbps. So there is a drop. It says it's fast on speed test and can run multiple devices. Hope so as I have wifi compatible devices I use in back yard in Summer.",

                "reviewText": "So far so good ..... Product was fairly easy to setup and the extended Wi-Fi signal appears to be strong although I haven't checked the farthest reaches outside in my yard due to weather conditions (rain). I live in a typical subdivision with a typical size yard.I had initial trouble with the QR code as the internet reference page locked, but I opened another window and typed in the numerical sequence in the information packet and followed the instructions and everything is good. I would advise to plug the unit into an outlet where your Wi-Fi box is located so you get maximum interface with the extender when setting the unit up. You can then move the Wi-Fi extender to whatever area you want, and it will reconnect. I would have given it another half star or more, but I haven't been able to experience how the unit holds up and the extent of its range. Overall, I am fairly happy with the unit at this time.",
