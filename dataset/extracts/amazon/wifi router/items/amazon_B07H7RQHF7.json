We put one in a shed, in our dining room (which is closest to the shed), and the extra we put upstairs in the office. I now can get 2-3 wifi bars outside where I could only get 1 before. So it helped a little outside. Was hoping it would make it like it is in the house. Noticed no difference inside the house or office by adding this.",
