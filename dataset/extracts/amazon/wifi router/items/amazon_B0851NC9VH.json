                "reviewText": "Quality design and build. Does not run hot. Looks like something out of a sci-fi show with the design and the four movable antennae. Simplest set-up I have ever completed for a router. Took it out of the box, read the quick startup card. Logged onto the Linksys site as directed. Then plugged in the router to the outlet and the modem. Logged into the site as directed and set up the network and the router's password. Also, I set up another account that lets me access the home network remotely.I noticed how easily understandable and clear the directions for everything are. The router having a separate password and settings allowing for automatic updates is helpful. Can set up parental controls and can also set up all three bands separately with each having its own log-ins. The guest network is also nice.I was impressed by the strength of the signal in a 3700 square feet, two-story house with a full basement. It was five bars to the first floor from the router location on the second floor at the south end of the house, four bars to the deck and yard outside, and three bars to the basement Previously, the speed of the old router was 3 bars to the first floor and 1-2 in the basement and 2 outside on the deck. Also, ran some tests for performance (I am not an IT guy) but the results surpassed my old router.Also, just for our own purposes, we tried to overload the system, so we had three computers, three cell phones (playing music on two and one messaging), and two TVs (one streaming Netflix and the other Hulu). There was no drop off of any device and no buffering delays. I assume this is due to the router being able to manage the devices and the individual data needs, but all I know is it worked. I was worried about needing an extender, but at this point am satisfied with the results.I gave this five stars based upon the quality of the router build, the ease of and flexibility of set-up, the features, and the performance-based upon less than a day of usage. I will provide an additional review down the road and if everything is still working flawlessly (or nearly so), will be happy to re-affirm the 5 stars then.",

                "reviewText": "Nice router. Pretty easy to set up if you follow the quick-start instructions. There was a moment when it said it couldn't connect to the router and that I should press the reset button on back. Once I did that, it found it and set up fine. The nice thing about it is that it doesn't have the super bright blinky lights on it that some routers have. Just a glowing Linksys light on top that indicates status based on whether it's on steady, or slowing flashing. You can get all the other status you need simply by logging into your mylinksyssmartwifi account, which connects to the router. The admin panel is far more sophisticated that my old router. You can do so much more, like set up guest accounts, prioritize certain devices over others (like streaming devices, for example), give different names and passwords to the 2.4Gghz and 5Ghz routers that are built into this, look at a graphical map of all connected devices, parental controls, and so much more. I gave it the same name and password as my old router, so devices like cell phones, Roku, wireless camera, wireless thermostat, iPads, etc, were all able connect without re-doing their setup. I did have to change the routers security setting to WPA2 Personal, instead of WPA2/WPA Mixed, in order to get my iPads to connect. Overall, seems like a great device at a great price. ******UPDATE: After using this router for a few days, I noticed that my internet speed is down to 1.5Mbps download / .89Mbps upload. Reconnecting my old router again, I get 3.5M download and .93M upload. So the download has dropped by half on this new router, while the upload is about the same. I've tried the swap a couple of times and verified this. I've also restarted both my cable modem and the Linksys router a few times to no avail. For now, I've taken this new router out of service and installed my old one again. I'm going to have to return it if I can't resolve this. *****SECOND UPDATE: I did some online research and got some advice from Amazon buyers, and learned that it was the \"Media Prioritization\" that was causing the slowdown. I had to go into Media Prioritization, then Settings, and then adjust the Downstream Bandwidth up to 4500kbps (my max. download speed on my Comcast plan is 3500kbps, so 4500 is more than enough to set it to. You may need to set it higher if you get faster internet speeds). By default, it was set to 1500kbps, except for the Roku devices that I had added to the priority list. I hadn't realized that by turning on Media Prioritization, it would throttle all other internet access down to 1500kpbs, except for the priority items. So you can either just turn M.P. off, or leave it on and raise the Downstream Bandwidth number.",
