                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 Router (Archer AX21), and I've been using it for a while now. Here's my review:1. Dual-Band Channels: One of the features I really appreciate about this router is the availability of both 2.4GHz and 5GHz channels. This flexibility allows me to connect various devices with different compatibility needs and maximize the router's capabilities.2. Good, But Not Amazing Wi-Fi Signal: The Wi-Fi signal provided by the Archer AX21 is solid, though not as amazing as I initially expected. It works well throughout my home, but it might struggle to cover larger spaces or more challenging environments. Overall, it gets the job done for my needs.3. Impressive Speeds: The speed performance of this router pleasantly surprised me. It's faster than I anticipated and delivers fantastic speeds for all my online activities, including streaming, gaming, and large downloads. I appreciate the improvement in my internet experience.4. Compact and Space-Saving Design: The Archer AX21 has a compact design that doesn't take up much space. This is a great feature for those of us with limited room for networking equipment. It blends well with the decor and doesn't dominate the area it's placed in.5. Excellent Value for Money: Considering its price point, the TP-Link Archer AX21 is a great deal. It offers performance and features that are much better than expected for a router in this price range. It's a budget-friendly option without sacrificing too much in terms of quality.6. Universal Device Compatibility: This router has been a breeze to set up with all my devices. It effortlessly connects to printers, tablets, phones, TVs, and streaming sticks in my household. The compatibility is broad, making it a versatile choice for a diverse range of connected gadgets.",

                "reviewText": "TLDR:I bought this router about a month ago when my older one started to stutter. After some initial issues with firmware and a round or 2 with TPLink tech support I got everything ironed out and now I am very pleased with the performance. For more details, please read on.I'm a Network Engineer who works from home. Internet access is critical to my ability to do my job. So, when my older Netgear wireless router started to show signs of failure (random WIFI network loss of signal and reboots) that I could not fix with firmware updates, I started searching for a new router.The BE550 is a slightly less expensive version of TPLink's top end router. It lacks the extra LEDs on the front that allow for it to display the weather and a few other cute features, and it only has 4 LAN and 1 WAN(Internet) connections, all of which are 2.5G. there are no 10G ports on this router. Since I don't need to move that much data, it wasn't a deal breaker for me.Install was pretty easy, but I was also taking the opportunity to upgrade my Cable modem to a newer model and to install a 2.5G NIC in my home PC. After initial bootup and configuration of my home and guest networks, I ran speed tests that showed significant improvement in throughput. I have Gigabit service and improved my wired speeds from 690Mbps average to 1.1Gbps average on my home computer. The 2.5G ports are really doing there jobs and keeping the data moving without a bottleneck.Unfortunately, after about 24 hours, the new router became unstable. The wireless signal would cut out, and even wired connections would lose internet access intermittently. As I tested components I ruled out the Cable modem and the new NIC and started to focus on the router. Constant ping tests to google would randomly time out for 20-30 seconds and then return. At the same time the LAN side access into the router would be lost, which shouldn't happen if the loss of signal is on the Internet side.I opened a ticket with TPLink and was surprised by how quickly they responded. After some initial testing with a tech on the phone, the ticket was kicked to the next level of support and all subsequent support was via email. The techs asked for log files and information about my troubleshooting and the analyzed that for about a day. They then sent me a firmware update (which wasn't available via the firmware update process in the router) and asked me to apply it. Once that was done, the router stabilized and hasn't shown any issues for about 48 hours.Like:Design - more like a book than something from a Star Trek movie.WIFI Coverage: Even with internal antennas, I have very good coverage of my 2000 sq. ft. house and my backyard.WIFI Speed: Phones and tablets are easily pulling 8-900Mbps from anywhere in the house.WIRED Speeds: My desktop (with 2.5G NIC) is able to pull 1.2Gbps easilyDon't Like:GUI: Maybe I'm just picky, but I think the GUI needs help. It isn't as intuitive as the Netgear router I replacedPrice: This is an expensive piece of kit at $300+ Overkill for a lot of people, but there are limited 2.5G capable wifi routers on the market",
