                "reviewText": "Edit: I changed the rating to 5 stars from 3 because the router itself is really nice and quite effective in spite of some woeful errors and misleading information in the manual and quick start guide that made it frustrating to get it setup. See added comments below.Wow. Yes, so far after spending some hours trying to connect and configure this router--it works well it seems. No, I'm not completely set up but things are working for some devices now. What's my quibble? Very little about the \"quick startup\" and the manual \"quick start\" instructions matched the actual router well enough to get off the ground. Astonishingly, tech support was totally unaware of what was not working and I had to stumble around while they were escalating to get into the setup menu by alternate means.1. The URL for getting into the router's setup failed in Linux with two browsers. The browsers (chrome and firefox) changed the typed URL I gave it to a generic asus url. I could not get them to trigger the router's internal ddns to give me the setup software.2. Chat help gave me a standard baseline IP to login: 192.168.1.1--didn't work. They couldn't understand why. It turned out that the router's internal initial IP was 192.168.1.50. Wow. Heads were spinning at Asus Help Chat.I eventually got into the router's setup (while waiting for the \"escalation agent\" to arrive on the end of the line. Then, the setup menus were not as shown in the pdf manual on the disc that came with the router. It would be really nice if the folks that update the software would update the manuals before releasing it all to the world at large. Really bush league for a first rate hardware company like Asus. I have super Asus products that I think are first rate. I am shocked at how poor the instructions that came with this router were in spite of how good the router seems to be.edit: it continues. There was a one sentence statement in a menu that implied that router login authentication could be more secure by making it via \"https\" so I clicked on it. Nope, locked me out until we agreed to reset to factory status by putting something in the pin-hole reset button. Bingo, 4 hours of setup disappeared but I was in again. Grrr. Totally inadequate documentation of what that would do and the inference that it was going to make logging in more secure. Grrr. The documentation of this device is well-intended but grossly out of date and also, it seems woefully inaccurate in some places where things get really important.edit 2: I made this 5 stars because the router is really nice now that I've had 2 weeks to use it and tweak things. I should say that I have been dealing with multiple routers as technology has advanced for over 20 years. Overall, the menu system is good and reasonably well-documented within the router. The idea that the Quick Start Guide and the manual both failed to give me information that got me logged into the router from Chrome and Firefox within Linux is quite dismaying and a first for me. The idea that even Customer Support did not have the correct IP for logging into the router is astonishing. Logging in from Windows (which I almost never use) worked for the login url and I was then able to change the base IP to a value that fit the static IPs in my system.Customer Support was earnest and polite. I was passed from a first line tech to a supervisor and the latter suggested a couple of things to get past the \"https\" lockout and then said I'd have to do the \"pinhole reset.\" I assumed all along that I'd have to do that but was hoping not need to start over with setup which I had spent a while doing. However, the reset did not affect the firmware upgrade I had performed and I had notes for all the manually defined IPs and their corresponding MAC addresses and so redoing the setup went pretty quickly.Performance: I had purchased the router because it was recommended by Nvidia support that getting a router with MU-MIMO capability was a good idea for enhancing streaming as well as one that was dual band. This router is 3x3 MU-MIMO and in addition it provides stronger signals from the other side of the house to my livingroom where the important wifi devices are located. Greater range would be overkill that only exposed my LAN to more of my neighborhood. Speed is great for streaming to my streaming box and Smart 4K TV. Three walls and about 40 feet of distance between the router and devices is no problem. I am still tinkering with the QoS settings to see how that affects things. I have yet to use the internal VPN and it was suggested by my VPN provider that for maximum speed with VPN I should stick with clients on my computers and individual devices since encryption and decryption may be demanding for router processors.So....I can recommend the router strongly for those who can get past the hiccups imposed by the faulty documentation. I still have not explored what exactly was being suggested in the menu system about using https for better security in accessing the router menus and I doubt I check that box again any time soon. Changing the login username and passwords should be safe enough in my somewhat isolated location and moderately low tech neighborhood.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars NOT made in China. Fast, excellent security.",
                "reviewText": "You can verify everything written here is true with a quick google search. Talking to you, Amazon.While ASUS does source some production to China, ASUS is a Taiwanese company and the sticker on the router states \u201cMade in Vietnam\u201d. I\u2019m inclined to believe that. The product origin on this page states \u201cChina\u201d but I doubt, and hope, that\u2019s not true. You may not think it matters, but it does more than you might know.Most consumers only care about speed and affordability when it comes to routers, but it should be security at the top of the list. All your data flows through your router, including personal and financial data. Security flaws in your network can also affect neighboring networks around you. If you buy a cheap router based on speed capability alone with security flaws built in, either intentionally or not, you\u2019re basically paying to be hacked, or for your neighbors to be, or possibly unknowingly being a conduit for attacks on your entire country. It has happened in the past, it\u2019s still happening, and will continue to happen.Most routers today are produced in China. Even companies based in the US produce there and it\u2019s very hard to find one that\u2019s not made there. The problem with routers made in China is that ultimately, businesses there are controlled by the CCP government, not the business owner. This allows their government to implement whatever they want in their exported tech and products. It\u2019s why some of their tech companies like Huawei have been banned in numerous countries. Routers made in China from brands like Wavlink which are sold in big retail stores across the US have been found to contain hidden back doors and intentional security holes and vulnerabilities to malware like Mirai. Basically open doors for hackers. Some of these back doors have been used in the past to launch cyber attacks (Mirai botnet) on the US which caused major network outages, as well as in other countries. From a cybersecurity perspective, these look a lot like \u201ctrial runs\u201d to me. But speculation and paranoia aside, why take the chance on inviting that kind of tech into your home? It wasn\u2019t an isolated, one time event when these back doors were discovered, and it was with various routers and companies out of China. Again, all this is verifiable with the slightest amount of research using credible sources.I have tried some routers made in China. I could tell they had horrible security just by using the app, or during setup. One was capable of remote access, yet the option to turn it on or off was non existent. It didn\u2019t even ask during set up and the option was nowhere in the app. Remote access should always be turned off, unless you need to access your router from outside your home, which is rarely needed for the average user. If it\u2019s on, it\u2019s just an unnecessary access point open for hackers to attempt access. It might have been possible to check by connecting directly to it using the Web UI, but instead I just returned it and went on the hunt for non-Chinese routers. It took a lot of research since there aren\u2019t many, but finally landed on this one.I am much, much happier with this ASUS router and it seems very security focused! There are numerous security options available in the app, and also asks you about remote access during set up. It has AI Protection by Trend Micro built in (included free of charge) which constantly monitors your network for viruses and intrusions and even blocks harmful websites. You can also monitor all connections and traffic through the app. There are even additional apps you can download for more functionalities.As for speed, WiFi 6 is awesome. This thing is lightning fast to my previous ISP provided router and much more stable. If you\u2019re not familiar with WiFi 6, it\u2019s not really a speed booster. It provides a more stable connection though, even in very signal-congested areas such as apartments or offices where there\u2019s numerous routers and networks overlapping and causing interference. This more stable connection will often times yield higher speeds. Your PC and various hardware must be WiFi 6 capable to utilize it, but there are cheap and affordable USB adapters available to enable it on your PC if it\u2019s not already capable. Aside from that, the 5GHz signal is stable and fast, even without WiFi 6. 2.4GHz is not bad at all either. There are options in the app to monitor what\u2019s connected at all times and you can even limit bandwidth to certain devices, or ban them from connecting completely if you want to streamline your connections.There are a lot more features to this router, which are easily accessed from the app which appears extremely robust compared to the anemic apps I used with the Chinese routers. Those seemed like toys compared to this. I haven\u2019t tried Ai Mesh, but it is yet another useful capability of this router.Completely happy with this router based on speed, stability, capabilities, and most of all, security!",

                "reviewText": "I'm a big fan of ASUS hardware, and they did not disappoint on this router. Setup took all of about 15 minutes. The app is handy for monitoring usage and devices.Worked perfectly for a small apartment. There were always multiple devices connected and we never experienced any throttling. Both a PC and Xbox were hard wired in the whole time - almost no upload/download loss from our advertised internet speed (300MB/s).Some clarifications:1. The 5GHz wifi has great speed but limited range. The 2.4GHz wifi has better range but worse signal.2. Your internet provider gave you a modem, which you plug into the wall. You plug the modem (via ethernet) into this router, and it creates wifi you can connect to. It also has additional ethernet ports for hardwired devices such as a gaming PC or console.Highly recommend. You should send back the wifi \"pods\" your internet provider gave you and use this instead.",

The delivery arrives early on Apr 29 exceeding my expectation on delivery considering that this is an overseas shipment.. The set up was smooth with strong signal to link up to my main router which is blocked by a wall. With this AP, my 2 other bedrooms are receiving strong signals. For buyers who are in Singapore, please note that the product comes with a US plug so you would need an adaptor.",
