I can't speak to the stock firmware much as it was only on for a short time, but it worked well and had good features while I used it. Easy to setup. I installed tomato firmware, and it has been solid. No reboots necessary, rock solid with great range, even through several walls. Speed tests confirm fast throughput for our fire stick, and cell phones, tablets, etc. A really nice feature is the USB port on the router, which allows the use of a thumb drive or hard drive for file serving on your local home network. I use a small SSD drive in an external enclosure on mine, and it shows up fine on my Amazon fire stick running Kodi. It's a great way to quickly show photos to friends and family, or play movies I've ripped from blu ray, etc.",

                "reviewText": "Ok, I was in the same boat as many other negative reviewers here. I couldn't get the Smart WIFI Web Based Setup to work, then the router started to loop and then it would randomly reset/reboot on its own. Now, I am not a network tech or even in IT but I do know my way around most electronic devices. These symptoms that others had written about were the same that I was now experiencing with this brand new router. Heck, I couldn't even make it to the setup page to try and update the firmware because of the hardware resetting/rebooting every 10-45 seconds.Stepping back for just a moment, this reminded me of a 12v audio/computer installation that experienced similar problems/behavior. Our 12v in car PC would have instability and random reboots/random hardware failures. After many hours testing each component in the setup as well as checking each wire in the custom harness, a ROOKIE, yes a ROOKIE got his multimeter out and tested the source power (where the harness was hooked to the battery/distribution box) and the destination connections (where the harness lead into the car PC) and as it turns out, the voltage was below 10V, causing us to realize that we used the wrong gauge wire. We essentially used the bare minimum wire for the installation and whenever the in car PC would have a load on it (cold boot), the voltage would drop just enough to cause issues. We beefed up the power line considerably and all was well after that.Why the heck do I write a router review that includes a story about a 12v car PC? Cause the same problem is here:The Linksys label on the bottom of the router calls for a 12v 2a power supply. I checked the power supply that this NEW router came with and low and behold, the darn thing is rated for 12v 0.5a. This router will NEVER work properly without the correct power supply. I got a power supply from my LED strip parts bin that was rated for 12v 3.0a and plugged it in (same barrel connector). The router immediately came online, downloaded its updated firmware immediately and went online within 1 minute. I have only had this router for two hours since the power supply was corrected and I have had NO issues as of yet.To all of the folks that still have this router and are having any intermittent connectivity issues or having setup issues, check the power supply label and see if it is 12v 2.0a or higher. If it is not, replace it and hopefully that will solve your issues. Keep in mind that you may need to complete a factory reset with the new power supply and go through the setup process (as noted in the forums and manuals). If your router still is NOT working after correcting the power supply and redoing the factory reset & setup, then you may truly have a defective unit.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a used one and saved probably 50%, so I was pretty happy with the price (about $35). I needed a wifi router to work with the dsl line for the free wifi that my apartment complex provides, didn't want to pay tons of money, and still wanted something good.That said, even though I read the reviews, I was thinking... Linksys would've fixed the plug problem - wouldn't they have? (the first amazon suggested/helpful amazon review explains this issue)... well anyway, I got it, plugged it in, set it up. No issues with the set-up, all reasonably self-explanatory (if you kit doesn't come with instructions, it was easy to google and download them -- and easy to follow). But if you connect directly to the unit with an ethernet cable, you probably don't even need instructions for set-up. (Since my unit was used -- I had to use the factory reset button, but push that for 10 sec and then everything went smoothly)And immediately, within probably 5 minutes of initial set-up the wifi signal stops working. It would start, but then stop every few minutes. Basically the wifi signal was unusable.I immediately ordered a new 12v 2a power supply, about another $12 (ugh!) -- since I seemed to have exactly the same issue that one of the reviewers described (12v 0.5a power supply came with the product). I got a \"Pwr+ 12V Charger AC Adapter for Linksys Wireless Router...\" from Amazon since it would come the next day.I got the new power supply. You need to hit the \"factory reset\" button once you plug it in the new unit. Then re-do the set-up. I haven't had a problem since. Works great.My apartment is tiny, so I can't really comment on range since I basically am sit right next to my router, but am happy with the product. Maybe since my wifi router was bought used, the newer products would have fixed the power supply/plug issue -- but you should double check as soon as you get it. Needing to buy a power supply for a brand new router would be super annoying.",

                "reviewText": "I'm very pleased with this purchase so far. First of all, just by upgrading to this router, my wireless speeds increased right away from about 10-20 mbps to a consistent 65. Also, I really like that this is a smart router, for a number of reasons. I like that it can upgrade its own firmware (especially in light of the recent Krack hack - not sure how risky that was, but it's reassuring to know that any patches will be included without me having to go online to personally deal with that). Also, the phone app is very handy. It's really easy and convenient now to handle things like changing my wifi name, changing the password, seeing what devices are connected, deciding which devices to prioritize, sharing the guest network password, etc. The price was reasonable, and setting it up was pretty painless.After upgrading to this router, my live-streaming sports on TV was still sometimes getting pretty blurry, but then I upgraded my ethernet cord to this Amazon Basics Cat6 version for $5 (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N2VILDM/ref=twister_B00O1RTQJE?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) and that seems to have taken care of it.",

I was easily able to set it up with the help of a mobile app. The router is smart enough to create own IP address and do its own setup. I just had to connect my LAN cable to it, and i was good to go.Guest internet: It was easy as well. By default a guest ID and network is created. When you login the Guest network, it opens up a linksys page asking for a password for internet access. The password is preset(which can be changed) via mobile app. Now i can give internet access to my guests without letting them access my network.The router creates its own network to share data among the connected computers and laptop. This help one to create a LAN network of its own without setting up expensive switches.Pros:1. Easy Setup2. UI is simple3. Simple Mobile app4. Wifi range is very good. Covers 2000 sqft. Though my area has no walls.Cons:1. I can't think of any cons as yet. Will update if i find any problems.",
