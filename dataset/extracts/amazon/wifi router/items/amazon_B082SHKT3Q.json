They were cutting out from just the distance between my chair and tower (they're basically right next to each other lol), so I looked around and found these. Now I can walk around my entire house without having them cut out at all. Pretty great. And very inexpensive!",

My upload/download speeds were already good to begin but I wanted to clean up my cabling a little. When using the new antennas, I verified my speeds were maintained with my upload speeds improving by 50Mbps.The connectivity results will vary for everyone as these 3 dBi gain antennas provide a wider coverage/shorter distance when compared to higher gain antennas that are more focussed but can travel further. Guess I could try other higher gain antennas later.Overall, I am pleased with the results and the new antennas help me eliminate hanging cables when using the original OEM ones. Now, hopefully my antenna in the picture won't get too warm since it is receiving exhaust air. Guess I could have it pointing down :)",
