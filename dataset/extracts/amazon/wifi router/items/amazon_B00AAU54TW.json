                "reviewText": "AT THE END BELOW I GIVE SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO MAKE THIS ROUTER PERFORM AT IT'S PEAK (for novices).This router is amazing for the price. You can't beat the bang to buck ratio here. The only problem here is that there's clearly a model lottery going on. Some are getting the E1200v1 while others are getting the E1200v2 at random. There's no way to choose, & you REALLY want that v2 model. It has double the RAM of the v1 among other things & you can do a lot more with it in terms of installing CFW etc. I was lucky enough to get a v2. It performs better than its v1 counter part & is immune to a security flaw present in the v1s. As soon as you get your v2 (if you get one) & set it up, you'd want to go & download the latest firmware build from Linksys support & install it to the router. The v2 here comes with the 2.0.02 2012 build. You want the 2.0.06 2013 build to clear up the bugs & security flaws the router comes with.Now that we're past that...this router is FAST. I mean FAST, & VERY stable. I had a Belkin-G before & couldn't download 500MB without the connection dropping constantly on me. With the E1200v2, I've been downloading 4GB files all day & the connection hasn't dropped once, & it's downloading way faster than my Belkin even in Mixed Mode. I was afraid of the \"refurbished\" status of this product. As someone who studies & deals in I.T. & tech, I generally don't practice buying used or refurbished electronic products. It's out of the question for me. However, I took the chance with this router & I haven't regretted it. There's a wealth of features to enjoy even without using CFW on it, & the interface is easy enough for beginners to get a grasp on it.If you want this router to perform at it's best there are a few settings you'd want to change from the get-go. I'll give you a heads up:1. Apps & Gaming>>>QoS: Disable WMM support2. Wireless>>>>Basic Wireless Settings: Change Config View to manual, set your Channel to either 1, 6, or 11. If all the devices in your home support the same type of wireless standard (eg. wireless-n, wireless-g etc), set it to broadcast that standard ALONE in Network Mode instead of using \"Mixed\".3. Wireless>>>>>Wireless Security: Just like with your signal standard above, if all your devices support the same security protocol, select it from the drop down list instead of using a Mixed Mode. Select either WPA2 or WPA (preferably WPA2 if all your devices support it).4. Setup>>>>IPv6 Setup: If you don't know what IPv6 is or don't know whether you're using it or not, chances are...you aren't. Disable it.There you have it. Hope you guys get the same great performance from this router as I did.",

                "reviewText": "After my last experience with ordering a wireless router for a cheaper price, and having to return my first item ever to Amazon (and I order nearly everything here from coffee to shoes to office supplies to books...) because in order for the router to work it required me to download some crazy ridiculous software I was standoffish to order another one. In fact, if I didn't invest in an iPhone 4 last month that required a Wi-Fi connection to save on my data I would have not ordered another wireless router. But I did, and I'm so glad that I chose this one.The router arrived promptly and came with a CD for installation, power cord and blue cable. No manual, which made me a little anxious. I put the CD into my computer as requested, followed the simple instructions (that did not involve going into my computer's control panel to configure a bunch of codes and keys like the other router). I followed the directions for plugging in the router into the power cord and my existing wired router. Within five minutes of opening the box I had full bars on my laptop. Cha-ching!I did have the option to update the system after I got connected, which I opted for, and the Internet still works. It also hooked up to my iPhone 4 with no problems. Otherwise, I have had the Internet for a week and have had only one incident of dropped Internet, but that is due to a regular update from my DSS provider and it occurs at night when most people are asleep, so would normally not be a problem. The connection went off at that time and came right back on; I wouldn't have even known about it if I weren't working online. Also I have moved the phone into the bathroom and into two different bedrooms in our one story home and the service dropped one bar in these rooms when the doors were closed but went back to full three bars when I opened them.I'll post an update in the next few months about the service. Hope this helps resolve any questions you have about purchasing this quite affordable wireless router.",

After 4 more days, it stopped connecting to the Internet. We changed everything around this router but did not work. Ultimately after replacing this router with another one, things got sorted. This router was a culprit. Now i cannot even return this router via Amazon as i am 2 days late for the return. Frankly speaking, i did not expect this from Linksys.",
