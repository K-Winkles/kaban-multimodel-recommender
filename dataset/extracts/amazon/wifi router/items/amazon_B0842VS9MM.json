I'm a big believe in refurbishing electronics as it usually means they work better than when they were new! And I'd much rather save an older router from the trash than get a brand new one.The install and connection was so easy, and was already up and running with a password, network name, and security within a matter of minutes. The signal is strong and reaches nearly all over my 1500sqft apartment.The item did have some minor scuff marks, but I just think it gave it some character. Otherwise it works as if it were brand new, and we've had no problems since we set it up. Definitely worth it!",

                "reviewText": "Got this router when I moved into a new place and wanted to upgrade from the standard router/modem combo my ISP sells. It was definitely an upgrade for all of my dual-band devices. My laptop, phone, Fire TV, etc. all got more stable and had much faster download speeds (didn't see any real change in upload speed). The problem was adding smart devices. Many of them are not dual-band, just 2.4Ghz, and can only be set up with a device that is on the same 2.4 Ghz network. WELL, Google has unhelpfully made it completely impossible for you to specify which band you want to be on for dual band devices. So there's no way to set up 2.4 Ghz smart devices using this router.Now you'll see a bunch of Google stans in tech support forums claim that it's just so super easy to do, all you have to do is get out of range of the 5Ghz network and your phone will switch to 2.4Ghz and you can set up your device. Only problem with that is you now have to set up a smart device FROM ACROSS THE STREET. Makes it very difficult to see the visual cues the device is sending as part of the setup process.On top of that, the stans make it sound like setup is this one time thing, so you'll stand across the street once and never have to do it again. In reality, smart devices fall off the network ALL. THE. TIME. So you're back in your perch across the street, trying to redo your setup a few times a month. All of this could be fixed if Google would just allow the dual bands to be separated, like EVERY OTHER WIFI ROUTER ON THE PLANET. But they won't fix it, so now I'm stuck buying another router and throwing this hunk of junk in the garbage. THANKS GOOGLE!",

However, in order to use my (numerous) Smart Home Devices on the mesh wi-fi network, I had to re-setup ALL of them with the new password and username! Fortunately, you can leave them connected to the old non-mesh network in the meantime. That way you can break up the monotonous task into smaller sessions and work at your own pace.How did the reception issues turn out? They were all completely resolved. I can stay on VPN all day, all night. A lot of minor glitchiness with Smart Home Devices and Chromecast disappeared and that was noticed only by their absence.",

Mine came with that black mark on the device, I actually never bother cleaning it, cause it sits behind the tv we can't see it anyways. It also might be hard to clean off so if that bothers you think before you buy.wifi works fab. Super easy to setup, we have Comcast and pixel products so it works well in our Google ecosystem, for work I have iPad and MacBook, wifi connects fine with that as well. it's been a month no problem so far. Love the saving.",

                "reviewText": "I have a Google Wi-Fi x 3, and upgraded to a Google Nest Wi-Fi, but just one to test, and like the results so much that I bought two Access Points to match.I hard-wired the Nest, which helped the speed, too. The speed increase is so good that I am running wires in the remainder of the house, now, too. The price difference was small enough that I stepped up to Cat7 to future-proof my cables, while I am at it.For now, one router is doing the work of three. As soon as the access points are delivered, I'll expect to be full speed, throughout the house.Since I stayed with Google, setup was simple. I am very happy with my slightly used, but renewed Nest",
