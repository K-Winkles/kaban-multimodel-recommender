We cut the cable a few months ago, so everything on our TV comes from the Internet, and we were getting pauses.I kept the old network name and password, so this was plug and play. I got a router and two repeaters because my house is about 3400 sq ft and the internet connection for the router is at one end of the house.Installation was totally painless, everything works perfectly, and no more pauses. I and my wife are very pleased.",

                "reviewText": "First the device is absolutely fantastic once you get it up and running and my house has a mesh Wi-Fi network in every nook and cranny.I have Centurylink and went in expecting the worst and it was. There was no \u201cjust plug it in and it works\u201d as advertised. I had to research that I was on a PPPoE with my VLAN and get my username and password from Centurylink. After that I had to doublenat my Eero because PPPoE wasn\u2019t supported on the firmware it shipped with. After that it was a hard reboot for the Eero and then attempted many times to connect to my modem. Eventually I gave up and just left it in with a hokey doublenat configuration.I\u2019m not a network engineer and had no clue what the above meant so it took me a long time to understand all this. The Eero help guide only got me so far and had to go to other forums. To be fair I did not call Eero customer support but there has to be an easier way. My biggest criticism after the supposed plug-and-play marketing is they\u2019re shipping refurbished units with pretty ancient firmware. I believe the PPPoE addition was over a year ago.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars It just works",
                "reviewText": "I've been doing IT work for 30+ years. When this router came up on sale, I couldn't resist. WiFi6 for under $50 from a reputable company? Sure, I'll try it.Setup was indeed fast. I'm not a fan of apps and would prefer to do everything through a web browser, but the app and router worked flawlessly. I think most non-technical people would have no trouble following along and be up and running in about 5 minutes, with most of that time waiting for the devices to power up. Very little needed from the user to get these going.So far, range has been great and they've been stable. I can't comment on speeds too much as I only have an 80/10 Mbps internet plan, so this router is far more capable than my internet connection. This replaces an Asus RT-N66U router, which is an 802.11n router, and just this single Eero router has better coverage than the N66U. I don't need any more coverage than this, so I'm good.Despite being so locked down and automated, you still have the ability to set DHCP reservations and Port Forwarding, which really is as advanced as I need for my home setup. Sure, I'd like VLANs and other things, but with some adjustments it's doing everything my old Asus router with Merlin firmware was doing for me. I even have a Pihole connected and running on here.So...what's not to like? The only things I dislike are generally why the Eeros are so popular. They're not meant for techie users. They're highly simplified, highly automated. There aren't all sorts of settings to adjust and tweak, nor are there tons of reporting. BUT, they're not meant for it. It's a bit of an adjustment for a techie since the Eero handles all of this automatically, and so far, it's handling it well. I'd like a web interface rather than app or at least in addition to the app, but at the same time, the app does everything it needs to. More Ethernet ports would be appreciated though. I did have to buy an external 8-port switch to have this replace my Asus. The Asus had 5 ports total (1 WAN, 4 LAN), whereas the Eero only has 2 Ethernet ports.At the end of the day, especially after dealing with IT problems at work all day, it's nice to come home and have something this simple that just works. It's home WiFi, not corporate. Eero has managed to turn home WiFi into an appliance. Plug it in, set the WiFi name, set the password, done.One other thing I like are that firmware updates are regular, so far monthly. Eero's smart in having a limited number of models available, so it's much easier for them to support. They say they'll keep supporting a router for 5 years after it's final date of sale. If that holds true it'd be amazing, BUT, it does look like they've done the planning to make this happen.",
