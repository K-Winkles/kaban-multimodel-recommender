All bands continually would disconnect, drop, lag, or just stop working. I spent well over 25 hours on the phone with the manufacturer/warranty company over a 3 month time period allowing them to trouble shoot the device. Cable company physically inspected the line and measured readings at 1000mbs. The company knows it is a defective product. The company sent me another refurbished item and it was just the same problem over and over and over. Next they tell me to return both, and they will refund my money, I send them back. They receive them and then tell me in writing they will not refund the money and will be physically sending me back the original unit I just sent back. I can not beleive the amount of money and time I have spent on this modem/router. Utterly the essence of stuck on stupid. BEWARE.",

                "reviewText": "I tried 2 other DOCSIS 3.1 cable modems, one with a wifi router, and the installation was difficult and ultimately did not work except in the case of one of them where the wifi signal was detected briefly and then never again no matter what I did to get it to work. I also use a VOIP telephone and a link to it was never established even though it was connected directly by an Ethernet cable. In contrast the Netgear Nighthawk Cable Modem Wifi Router Combo (C7800) worked perfectly and the signal was easily detected and links connected to all devices in this 2 story home. Fantastic!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this C7800 to hopefully replace a separate modem and a Nighthawk R7800 router with just one unit. Weeks into the purchase, I noticed issues with the device. The Wifi, especially the 5Ghz channel is spotty and drops out frequently and the speed is nowhere near half of what I should be getting. To verify, I plugged the R7800 into the C7800 modem/router combo via ethernet and turned off the C7800's wifi. Sure enough, the R7800 was getting screaming fast speeds, exactly what I was paying for from Cox. Since May of 2020, I have been on the phone with Netgear easily 20+ times, totalling over 30 hours of my time. Each call is usually an hour or more, because each time you call, the foreign outsourced customer support reps take you through the exact same steps as the previous call. This eats up about 45 minutes of wait time. And since their support loves to respond to negative reviews on here with a blanket statement to make it seem like they care, here's the deal Netgear: YOUR CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE!! In what world is it ok to tell the customer that you will call them back in 5-6 weeks with a response? Especially after they've spent numerous hours and have logged about half a dozen support case numbers from being bounced around so many times and for so long. It is now past the 6 week mark (7 months from initial purchase) from the last phone call, actually more like 8-9 weeks. Still waiting for that call. I go in periodically and request a status update on their support portal, just to keep my ticket alive. I was supposed to hear back from another tier of support just before Thanksgiving. Nothing but crickets. If this sounds like a fun time to you, go ahead and buy a Netgear product. Be warned that if you have a hardware issue, you'll just get a refurbished unit with the same problem. I'm moving my patronage to another brand... I suggest you do the same.",

                "reviewText": "Update 02/27/21 - It's been a little over a year since I bought this router and I thought it would be time to post a quick update. The router has been nearly flawless since I solved the initial READYSHARE issue. It's used probably 16 hours a day for work and school from home, streaming video from the connected external hard drive and more.Update 05/11/20 - A day after installing a Seagate 8TB external USB 3.0 drive to the C7800, it stopped being recognized on the PC via \\\\READYSHARE. I was still able to connect to the drive using VLC on my Samsung Note 9, but I was getting an SMB1 error on WIN10 which didn't make any sense as had been working just fine. After poking around online I found that the SMB1 protocol is out of date and using it opens you to vulnerabilities, I almost gave up and then decided to try to reset the router to its default configuration. In doing so, it upgraded my firmware from 3.01.40 to 3.01.43 and it also fixed the \\\\READYSHARE issue - go figure.ORIGINAL COMMENTS BELOW:So far, so good. I am getting strong WIFI on 2nd floor of house with the router located in basement. The 1st floor sub-flooring in our home is concrete and steel (1930's junior beam construction) and I had previously had issues getting any signal to 2nd floor even with WIFI extenders. My setup was painless as well as the Comcast installer called it in and had them activate it while he was onsite doing the cable install. I am connected to Comcast 100mbps service and am seeing slightly over 120mbps speeds on Speedtest via a Cat6 ethernet cable.. Roku and Tablo are flying along now. Will update as we get more time and use out of it.The 114mbps screen grab was done on my Samsung Note 9 using 5G wifi from the 2nd floor of our house. The router is in the basement and the signal has to go through steel I-beam and concrete subflooring on the 1st floor. We have Comcast 100mbps service, so it exceeds what we are paying for and the range is phenomenal. We used to need a wifi extender to get any signal bars on the 2nd floor of the house.",
