My router clips into the stand at three locations (the bottom and on either side about a 3rd of the way up) while resting on a solid bottom and back. The cuts for the power and satellite cable are perfect and well positioned. I am impressed with the holding strength to avoid accidental bumps that might knock the router over. I have this installed in my storage bay under the RV. I wanted to get the router off the storage bay floor and out of the way since I am constantly pulling and pushing bins and other items around in the bay (don't want to damage the router). Now it is up high, out of the way, and secure. I am not yet confident it could hold the router in place during travel days, but the ease of removing for storage then clipping into place when ready to use is great.",

In all, it took me more time to crawl into the basement than it took to install the wall bracket.Because of its location, I did add 2 screw in eyelets and a small bungee to keep it in place when moving my rig.
