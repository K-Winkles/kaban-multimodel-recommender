Installation itself was easy, but I was disappointed at first because it was giving me the same speed I was getting with the old Belkin router (16mps down/7mps up). I was all set to send the product back to Amazon for a refund and go back to the Belkin, but I decided to call Netgear tech support first. After making a few adjustments to router with the support person's guidance, I was able to get the speed up to as high as 26.53 down / 10.67 up.My only complaint is that I had to talk to a tech support lady in India, who I could barely understand. I wish American companies would stop outsourcing their tech support to India, but guess that's just the way it is nowadays.I recommend this router to anyone who has a high speed ISP connection.",

                "reviewText": "Just installed it, it installed very easily. It seems to be running fine so far, just a few hours into it. All my devices connected no problem, ethernet cable and wireless. One little thing that knocks down the rating for me; they provide a little desktop application called NETGEAR Genie. This is where you are supposed to manage the router and make any changes or additions you need. It did not install and run on my brand-new Windows 10 computer. I finally contacted NETGEAR customer support (that is a whole story in itself) only to find out that this is a known problem and NETGEAR does not know why it won't work on some W10 computers and apparently hasn't been able to come up with a fix for it. That makes me lose a little confidence in them as to their technical expertise. But they have a work-around; a website where you can log in and manage your router from it. BTW, you have at least three sets of logins when you go with this router; the login for the router itself, a different login to your account at Netgear, and a third login to the admin website. Hope I can keep these all straight!***1/6/2016 UPDATE***Just heard back from Netgear Support, here is what the technician said: \"the Netgear genie application is currently not supported for Windows 10.\" They also provided me with a link to download a previous version of Netgear Genie that once I installed it did work. So all's well that ends well.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a general computer user. I'm not an IT guy, but I've been around computers for a long time. I know how to set up networks and wireless routers.This one in comparison to the others I have purchased was difficult to set up. I tried it through the WIFI connection with my laptop but it never would log in. I had to connect to the router with a cable then log into it. However, once I went through the setup, it still didn't want to work. Everyone could see it and connect to it but it wouldn't do anything else.In frustration I connected to it via a laptop through Wi-Fi and was brought to an entirely different screen that allowed me to continue the set-up process. After that, it worked fine. I just don't think it should have been that frustrating.As far as service goes now that it's working, I'm not super-impressed with the speed or range. I was hoping for more than my 6 year old wireless router could do, but it's really not.The pros for this are the guest WiFi which was super easy to set up and the OpenDNS account was easy as well. This is a great content filter.I'm keeping this because of those two items, plus I just kept my old router and this router so now I have 3 different places to connect which has helped the bottleneck I was having with so many wireless devices at the house.Cons are the difficulty of setting up and I wish the guest WiFi had more options for control, such as time of day. If so I could just keep the kids on the guest one and keep them from having WiFi on school nights.",

                "reviewText": "I didn't realize it wasn't gigabit ethernet, which is my bad. It is pretty clear in the product description but still WTF.I've had it for about a week, and it seems to randomly drop connections to my laptop. I tried it on the 5GHz and 2.4GHz bands and both seem to cause trouble. There doesn't appear to be a firmware upgrade available. I tried it with a double-NAT and access point configuration.I don't seem to have the same troubles with my phone or tablet, so I'm not confident it isn't just a problem with the laptop, but I don't use the tablet often and my phone could be switching to LTE without me really noticing. It means the whole thing is suspect. Everything was working fine when I was using an older access point and the router provided by my ISP, except I couldn't take advantage of the downstream bandwidth over the wireless.I'm inclined to return it at this point.Edit: I now know what to make of this thing. It just plain stinks. It just gave my laptop the boot, and after a few minutes it booted my phone and then then I hit the \"reboot\" button in the admin interface from the tablet and it locked up the router and gave everything the boot. Had to cycle the power on the unit to get it to come back to life. Thanks for wasting my time, Netgear.",

                "reviewText": "When I saw the small size of this router I knew I was going to send it back for poor performance...BUT, I set it up (very easy and fast), and connected all my Wi-Fi toys to see what it does. Well, the signal is just amazingly powerful, especially on 5 GHz band. It goes through 2 wood stud and drywall walls, for a distance of about 15-17 feet and I get anywhere between 35 and 40 MBs download and 6-8 GBs upload ! At the 2nd. floor of my 2400 sq.ft. house, I get down 25 - 30 GBs, about 20 ft. away on a horizontal projection. My high speed Internet plan is 40 GHz down and 2 GBs upload. Go figure, the little Netgear is not only a very nice design and appearance, but also a stable and powerful wifi router. I don't use Ethernet, therefore I don't care about the lack of the Gigabit connection. The router is up and running for 3 days now and all is OK ! If anything bad occurs, I will update my review, but so far this router is amazing !",
