It took my IT guy about 2 good hours to restore the my router. What a wonderful investment. No phone number to call. A total waste of time money. Total loss about $3000.00. This is a good amount for a business of three people. I just trash it.",

It\u2019s always nice to be able to get rid of some frustration. A real person is on the other end of the line helping you out.",
