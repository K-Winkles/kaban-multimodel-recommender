Here, we provide a comprehensive guide to understanding everything about Wi-Fi, especially the 802.11ac WiFi antennas. 802.11a/b/g/n: Early generations, each with specific frequency bands and transmission technologies.802.11ac: Integrates the efficiency of Wi-Fi A and B, with higher speeds and improved range. MIMO technology allows for multiple simultaneous data streams.802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6): The latest development, with enhanced efficiency and performance features, especially in environments with many connected devices.802.11ad (WiGig): Complements Wi-Fi AC and operates in the 60 GHz band, offering very high data rates but limited to short ranges and direct line-of-sight.",

The benefits of Wi-Fi AC (802.11ac) include Utilization of the 5 GHz band for higher speeds and reduced interference. Standardized beamforming for targeted signal steering. Increased modulation (from 64QAM to 256QAM) for more bandwidth. Channel widths of 80 MHz and 160 MHz, doubling and quadrupling the bandwidth compared to Wi-Fi N.

We offer different types of antennas with varying ranges for various deployment scenarios. We are happy to assist you in selecting the right 802.11ac/ax WiFi antenna. 802.11ac (WiFi 5): The 802.11ac standard, also known as WiFi 5, primarily operates in the 5 GHz band and provides higher bandwidth compared to its predecessors (802.11a/b/g/n). 802.11ac supports MIMO, improving data transmission by utilizing multiple antennas, and contributing to better performance in environments with many wireless devices. 802.11ax (WiFi 6): The 802.11ax standard, also known as WiFi 6, also operates mainly in the 5 GHz band and offers higher theoretical data transfer rates compared to WiFi 5 (802.11ac). This allows for even faster wireless connections and improved performance, especially in environments with many concurrently connected devices. WiFi 6E (E=Extended): Wi-Fi 6E extends the available frequency range of the 802.11ax standard to the 6 GHz band (5925 - 7125 MHz), resulting in more available channels and further increasing bandwidth. The introduction of Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) brings additional improvements in efficiency, speed, and capacity. Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) allows access points to effectively communicate with multiple devices simultaneously. WiGig (802.11ad) specializes in extremely high speed over short distances and is mainly used for wireless docking stations in enterprises. Interoperability issues may arise, especially with different frequency bands. However, most routers are dual-band, allowing the use of various Wi-Fi standards. Backward compatibility exists as long as devices operate on the same frequency band. In practice, throughput is halved compared to theoretical speed, and the 2.4 GHz band may be congested in urban areas. For more demanding applications such as HD video streaming, 5 GHz WiFi is often recommended. When choosing WiFi for smartphones, tablets, and laptops, considering the supported antennas and streams is important to achieve maximum speed.",

Bluetooth and internet working fine all the same. I eventually will upgrade my wifi card to something more current hopefully with some 'Blueteeth 5.2' to bite more airwaves.

                "reviewText": "This external antenna set is designed to improve reception for LTE hotspots, routers, or WiFi adapters that have TS9 connectors. Keep in mind that TS9s are different from the threaded SMA coaxial antenna connectors found on many home routers and high end PC WiFi cards. The actual antennas in this kit use SMA to connect them to the magnetic bases, but the bases' extension cables terminate in a TS9.I seriously doubt the 10db signal boost claim, but if you're currently using a device's built-in, internal antenna, then these should provide better signal strength at a decent price, especially if you place the antennas as high up as the cables permit. Also makes a good set of spares for direct mount router antennas.",

                "reviewText": "These are decent antennas which help with the cellular signal on my broadband modem/router. The cable length is good without being too excessive, and they have a magnetic base to easily mount the antenna on a metal surface. The magnet isn't that powerful, and the antenna has a folding design allowing it to be mounted in different positions or angled as-needed, but this means it's less stable in a mobile environment... i.e. don't expect to place the antenna on your car for better signal because it will either bend over sideways or just fall off because the magnet isn't strong enough.",

My Lenovo tiny PC came with a wi-fi card installed but needed an antenna, so this resolved that. I am likely to see what it takes to add a wi-fi card into my Raspberry Pi system, Bluetooth can be a pain.",

                "reviewText": "This is the second set of inexpensive external 4G LTE antennas I try out. The first pair did much worse than stock internal antennas. I was hoping for better results with these, but no luck. While these perform better than the other set, they are no better (actually slightly worse on the download) than internal stock antennas.As you can see from one the attached image, the average download speed dropped from 67 Mbps to 53.82 Mbps. Notice there is an outlier in the downstream sample that came in at 39.44 Mbps. If I throw that out, there is a larger delta between the two tables.Ironically, the upstream bandwidth improved 26.82 Mbps to 31.74 Mbps. Notice there is an outlier as well. Which I did not drop in my calculations.Conclusion, while I experienced a slight increase in upstream speed, it does not warrant carrying around the antennas (with long cables) when I go on a trip. I'll stick to the internal stock antennas and hope for the best.",
