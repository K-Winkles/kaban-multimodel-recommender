There are many studies that link the radiation to a host of other sicknesses and neurological problems. So We need radiation shielding bags to protect our families from harmful radiation.",
            "[QUALITY MATERIALS] The radiation shielding wifi cover is made by Copper/ Nickel/Polyester Fiber which is certified to provide 99.999%protecting across the frequency range of 10KHz to 3GHz and still over 99.6% effectiveness at 5.6GHz. This fabric has good conductivity and shielding effect.",
            "[PAY ATTENTION]:The WIFI router radiation cover is made of high-quality copper-nickel material. When exposed to air for a long time, it will naturally oxidize, and the surface color will appear spots and turn black.It will not affect its function and shielding efficiency, it just shows the authenticity and high quality of the material.",
            "[BIG SIZE] The router cover measures 14\u201d x 16\u201d,suitable for both Wifi routers with or without antenna and for most types of routers in the markets.Our protective bags have Velcro at the seal. You are able to better enclose your router. we suggest wrap the entire router when you are sleeping or outside. Please note, the cover is not advised to wash",
            "[GOOD SERVICE] If you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, simply return it to Amazon within 30 days for a full money-back refund. And any questions about the product, just send us email and we will spare no efforts to solve it."

There are many studies that link the radiation to a host of other sicknesses and neurological problems. We think we are keeping our children safe and we do not realize how much danger we are putting them in by exposing them to all of these electromagnetic toxins. The Wi-Fi Router Cover is proven to block about 95% of electromagnetic field (EMF) and radio frequency (RF) radiation emitted by routers all day long.
