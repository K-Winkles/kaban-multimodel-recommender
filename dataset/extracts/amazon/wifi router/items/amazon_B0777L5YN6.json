                "reviewText": "I bought this because my campus wifi has switched to WPA2-EAP, but my tv and previous mini router don't support it.I was first surprised opening the box because it is much smaller than my tp-link, which is going to be great for traveling. I also like that it comes with a micro-usb cord to charge because my old router would fall out of the wall socket frequently. This is more flexible in my options for powering.When it comes to setup, this was a no brainer. So straight forward, and easy to do, once I found the link in the instructions. Previous router took me many videos and tutorials to figure out. I had this up and running in under 5 minutes, if even that.I have zero experience in IT and don't know much about wifi, but if I can figure this out, anyone can.The only thing I didn't like was that out of the box, it appeared to have been used previously even though I purchased a new option. That irked me a bit, but on the whole I am happy.Now I just need to test the distance, but since I bought to use in my dorm room, or hotel rooms while traveling, I don't really need the wifi to extend far so isn't something Im worried about.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very basic, very inexpensive little portable router. It runs Open WRT; though with minimal RAM and a slow CPU it won\u2019t be able to do much or perform particularly well. But that\u2019s probably not what you\u2019re looking for in a $30 router!I often tether to my phone when camping in my RV. The problem with this is twofold. One; tethering to multiple devices is sometimes flaky. Second; devices sometimes spontaneously disconnect because phones and tablets often stop broadcasting the SSID to save battery, causing client devices to fail to reconnect if they glitch or go out of range. Requiring you then to open the settings on the host device and reconnect everything. A real pain!This device does exactly what I need. I have an old iPhone I never use plugged into it via USB, with it\u2019s own unlimited data plan. (Note that, of course, your plan will have to support tethering). Now I have a WiFi router in my RV with a decent internet connection for streaming and the like on rainy days when I can\u2019t be outside. It works!I wish it was USB-C. Really nothing after 2017 or so should still be using micro USB. It\u2019s a flimsy connector prone to breaking and has more limits on how much power it can carry; which also limits power that can be passed through the USB port. It appears to be limited to 500mA. This is fine for cellphones but if you plan to connect a larger tablet, or wanted to share files from a power hungry USB hard drive; you\u2019ll find that to be limiting.That said, it does sip power. Meaning one potential use case would be to connect this to a USB power bank of some sort for truly portable Wi-Fi when tethered to a phone or USB modem.All in all, for $30 I\u2019m happy with it. Time will tell how well it works as time goes on!",

Tried a factory reset with no luck. I get the indicator lights that show that it is functioning but it does not transmit a signal. I am going back to the TP link for better reliability at a similar price. Might try customer support first!",

                "reviewText": "These are the best mini routers. I use the GL-AR300M16 for ROOters, and much prefer the Qualcomm Artheros chips (GL-AR300M series) over the MTK ones (GL-MT300A). It seems like these are smoother, a little more solid with the wireless, and just less quirks (not that the MTK had a lot of them, this one just seems flawless). If using for ROOters check or ask on the forum, because sometimes (as of writing) the firmware is not on the website (ofmodemsandmen) for many including the AR300M models but may be in the forum.Finally, I'm not sure if it's as important with other models or chips (such as the MTK ones), but with this one if you need to access Uboot mode to change or update the firmware (how I load the ROOter firmware) be sure to plug in your Ethernet cable to your computer BEFORE plugging in the power cable to the router (while holding the reset button long enough to access Uboot as stated in the documentation). Otherwise, it will fail to connect (just will time out) when connecting to the Uboot web interface at 192.168.1.1. If you plug in the cable and have the static IP set on the computer before powering up the AR300M, Uboot will come right up when trying to access it.Also - the AR300M16 is the NOR flash only version (of which the current ROOter firmware I use for it is - this may change in the future), but the AR300M has both the 16MB of NOR and 128MB of NAND and is kind of a different/new beast.Also - even though I really like these for ROOter routers there is nothing wrong with the stock firmware! Very good and flexible with lots of options! Can't beat these if you need a few little routers for something.",

I tether my phone into this, then this goes into my main router which then distributes to everything in the rack and it hasn't skipped a beat in the last few gigs I've done with the combo. Works perfectly, was priced rather cheaply and takes up no space.",
