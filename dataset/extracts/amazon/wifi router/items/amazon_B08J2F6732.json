Its nice to be able to look at all the devices and give them custom names and icons. This router has given me speeds that are above what I pay for at Cox. That is if its true or not using the SpeedTest app. I NOW can stream videos back to my bedroom from this router which actually lives in an enclosed stereo cabinet with glass door. This cramped area doesn't seem to hinder the signal.Very happy so far. Note: this product was factory refurbished. Still performs great!!",
