Xfinity's wifi modem kicks you off if you go idle for even a few seconds (to save them millions in costs) and this device eliminated that problem. Strong, solid signal. All bars are showing anywhere in and around the house within the modem stated range in square feet. It doesn't matter if you're in the first or second floor, the basement, or outside the house. Great deal for the money! The only negative I can say is that it took a 5 or 10 minutes to set up, because it took a minute for everything to update where I could access the router page on the internet to finalize the settings. But I think that's generally true of all Wi-Fi routers.",

Easier this way to setup fast devices, with only 2.4 Ghz ones like smart plugs and WIFI garage doors.The 5 Ghz signal range is very short. You need to be close to the equipment to use it. If you are rooms away it becomes very poor and you would need to rely on the 2.4 Ghz one. But if you need a cheap reliable router then it is OK overall.",

                "reviewText": "Where do I start? If I hadn't been configuring Linksys routers since about 1998, I would have been hosed.1) I purchased this router USED from the Linksys store. However, the morons forgot to clear the previous owner's settings, meaning not only could I not enter the zone passwords and names, I could also not even log into the control panel to enter the changes;2) I figured a quick IM to their tech support could tell me what I was doing wrong, as this was the first time in a decade I set up a Linksys router, so I was a bit rusty. Ironically, although Linksys claims the router will not work until configured, in fact it picked up the DHCP broadcast from Comcast via my DOCSIS 3.0 Surfboard, and NAT worked correctly, creating a Class C subnet with DHCP broadcasts.Although I was #4 in the queue, there was about a 10 minute wait to reach a tech. What happened once I got connected to a \"tech\" was a 30+ minute exchange with a total MORON who could not comprehend my problem, despite REPEATED explanations, even asking me why I want to get into the configuration pages TO BEGIN WITH, that I should use the \"Wizard.\" Since I had now invested 40 MINUTES(!) with this \"tech,\" I told him \"screw it, I'll do a hard reset, and we may get disconnected.\" So, I performed a hard reset (pressed the red recessed reset button on the bottom for 20 seconds); and was able to log into 192.168.1.1 and use the default password, which brought up the wizard, which is actually pretty good; though I needed to tweak a few settings manually.Surprisingly, I did not lose connection with the \"tech,\" so I let him have it before disconnecting with that schmuck;3) Much to my surprise, this router has only fast ethernet (100 Mbit) ports... INCLUDING THE WAN PORT!? You may get 1.2 Gb from one wireless device to another (why) but this thing caps out at 95 Mbit on the web. Why would Linksys (Belkin) build a WiFi 5 wireless router with \"Speeds up to 1.2 Gb\" and then skip the gigabit ethernet?! With my Surfboard showing 60 Mbit running the excellent speed test at DSLreports\u2022com (a tool I've used for 20+ years) plugged directly into my PC (i.e. sans router), the ethernet speed is not an issue\u2014But if you have a faster connection, say, gigabit fiber or cable, IT WILL BE.",
