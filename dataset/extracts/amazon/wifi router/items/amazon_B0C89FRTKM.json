                "reviewText": "Okay, here's the deal. I ordered the WAVLINK Mesh WiFi system twice, and both times it let me down. The first unit I got was a complete bust right out of the box. I reached out to the seller, and they told me they\u2019d refund me if I ordered a new one. Seemed like a decent deal, so I went for it. They even said not to bother sending the first one back, which at the time, I was cool with. I got the second unit, and it seemed to work just fine initially. But here\u2019s the twist - instead of refunding me for the first purchase, they refunded me for the second one. Ugh!Fast forward a bit, after using the mesh system for a while, my internet started acting like a rebellious teenager, going on and off whenever it wanted, turning my online gaming sessions into a frustration fest. After some poking around and troubleshooting, it was pretty clear - this mesh system was the culprit. I decided to return it while I was still within the return window, but now it\u2019s been a few weeks, and my refund is playing hide-and-seek.Now, I can\u2019t help but wonder if the refund for the second unit instead of the first was a mistake or maybe it was done on purpose, in case something like this happened. Whatever the case, it's a mess.I'm just throwing this out there for anyone considering buying the WAVLINK Mesh WiFi - be cautious. The system didn\u2019t live up to its hype, and now, getting my money back feels like chasing a rainbow. Seriously, who needs this kind of drama? So, if you don\u2019t want to go through what I did, maybe look for another WiFi solution.",

                "reviewText": "These on the whole have been great. We ha e two teenage sons who constantly play on their Xboxes with their mates, as well as having their phones on face time (I don\u2019t know why - I just pay the bills and enjoy the peace) and before these little cubes they used to whinge every day that they\u2019d lost signal in the middle of an important game. I know - those poor little cherubs and their first world problems.Anyway fast forward 7 months into ownership of this bad boys and problem solved. They seem to carry the signal around the house well and we\u2019ve seen a massive improvement.I also like the fact you can split out the 2.4 and 5.0ghz signals as well as have an easy push button guest WiFi network so you haven\u2019t got people asking for the password.All in all very pleased.",

                "reviewText": "I have sky internet, they took a bit of setting up.This is how I set it up with my sky router.Firstly youneed to disable the sky routers built in WiFi, connect the Wavlink via a Ethernet cable to the sky router. Set wan on the Wavlink to the same subnet as the sky router and switch dhcp off on your sky router.I then created a new subnet on my Wavlink network and enabled dhcp on the Wavlink router after giving the Wavlink router a static address.Once I successfully connected to the Wavlink router via dhcp I configured the secondary Wavlink box via the Wavlink routers webpage.It's given us good WiFi all across the house without any issues.",

This has finally been resolved, we have a reasonably large home with 4 bedrooms and these 2 have covered almost the whole home without any issues, now more dropped points wherever we are and no more switching between networks, they're reasonably easy to setup if you have the know how and very easy to just plug in and get going. My main issue was having to change all my passwords over but that was only needed once then all sorted.",
