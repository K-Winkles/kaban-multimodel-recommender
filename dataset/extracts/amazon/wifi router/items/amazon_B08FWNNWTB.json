We upgraded to this netgear router and so far it has been a game changer. The speed is alot faster. Not always having to reconnect to the wifi and the Xbox is working great just with the wifi. No longer needs to be hardwired. Even provides protection on all devices connected. Which is great for all our laptops and phones...which is a bonus for us! So far happy with the purchase",

                "reviewText": "*attached is a photo of the physical router, as well as wireless download speeds 45 feet away with 3 walls in between using a Wi-Fi 6 device (Alienware Area 51M R2)*This review is for NETGEAR Nighthawk Pro Gaming 6-Stream WiFi 6 Router (XR1000).Well this is one of the best routers I've ever owned. I upgraded from the Nighthawk R7000 and I am not looking back. I currently use the 1Gbps plan with Frontier, hooked up directly from the Ethernet cable to the ONT Box so I am not using a modem. I've never seen wireless speeds at this level in my 25 years of being alive. To put it to the test, I deleted my entire Steam library and re-downloaded all my games. I averaged 97-99 MB/s download speeds. To make that a little simple to understand, I could download 1GB of data in about 10-11 seconds. This is thanks to the new generation of wifi being WiFi 6, just make sure your devices support WiFi 6 before considering this router because if not, you're better off purchasing a cheaper router.The next best thing about this router is its range. I can go 45 feet away from the router with 3 walls in between and still get 4/5 bars on the 5Ghz channel. My download speeds drop from 97-99 MB/s to 70-75 MB/s, which I don't really consider that much of a loss.The software this device uses is called DumaOS 3.0, A next generation system that allows you to Calibrate the bandwidth usage between all your devices connected to this router. You are able to allocate the percentage of the bandwidth used either by applications or by devices. I prefer the system to divide my bandwidth by applications, and by activating the \"share excess bandwidth\", the system will provide more than the allocated bandwidth should you need it to get those big files downloaded quickly.A few noteworthy items are that I did have some trouble during initial setup, where the setup page kept on reloading while the router tried to update its firmware. A solution I found to this was to simply set up the router through the Nighthawk app on your phone. That process took about 5 minutes versus having trouble using the Ethernet cable to set up the router. The next issue I had was that my WiFi 6 capable laptop received a \"no internet connection\" when wirelessly connected to the router. I corrected this by doing a \"Network reset\" on my laptop. Once I tried connecting again to the router, the issue was resolved and connection was established.To summarize, I highly recommend this router IF:1. You own and use Wi-Fi 6 capable devices2. A good internet plan of at least 500/500 speeds to enjoy your wireless speeds.3. Desire the ability to customize your bandwidth usage across your devices.Enjoy!",

                "reviewText": "Update: I'm a security architect / engineer, been in the profession for 20+ years. Manage firewalls at work.Pro\u2019s: Wifi - fast, true, nice maps, lots of charts. Very Pretty, That\u2019s where it stops though.Usefulness? I found 17+ major areas where this > $300 item just does not stack up, so it will be ***returned***.TL;DR VASTLY SUB PAR for a) the price (> 300) b) NetGears' Rep (I have several products) c) and the maturity of the market. Yes, it is updated to current version as of early May 2022. I found at least 15 major usability problems that cause you to go elsewhere. Editing your own PING heatmap is buggy, error pone and just does not appear to work.These problems that WILL affect home users. There are BUGS listed here and significant user usability issues that, with 3% of effort, would make this device *significantly* more usable for the home user.1) Router does not come with an AdBlock list, it should, as its a core feature. When you *first* open the ad bock area, you get a nice message explaining feature, and it specifically calls out protecting smart TV's. When you go find in the support forum the suggested block list, the \u201cdefault\u201d one, and \u2026 you go to Amazon TV, IMDB shows do not play. Why? Because \u2026 they have an ad. Stop the ad blocker \u2013 IMDB shows play. Now this is not some obscure cheap-o \u201csmart TV\u201d service, its \u2026 AMAZON and IMDB!2) Router has a \u201cping map\u201d feature, the idea is to see response time for common games. That\u2019s not valuable to me. The idea of having my OWN ping map for work services, Google DNS. OpenDNS servers, etc., would help me to be sure that the services I need for work are \u201cup\u201d and I have good I\u2019Net connectivity. All of the entries I created do respond to ping (ICMP Echo Request) at the cmd line, but \u2026 alas \u2026 when you add them to the custom router\u2019s list and try it, you get zero response. Unlike the game lists.3) AD BLOCK: The adblock feature has a \u201cbubble map\u201d showing volume of adds blocked by a given device on the network. Devices are listed as \u201cunknown\u201d, UNLESS the device gives up its name in some manner. For a home user, this is useless. The absolute minimum should be to show the sending devices IP address. THAT would allow the system user to at least see if ads are blocked for \u2026 oh \u2026 I don\u2019t know, their SMART TV!!! It takes a LOOOOONG time for the \u2018adblocker\u2019 page to paint (longer than others). The ad blocker screen did not paint on initial access when I started this write up. I tried going to other screens, and back to ad blocker. ONLY when I hit the \u201crefresh\u201d button in the browser did the adblocker page paint. AdBlock history only goes back 24 hrs. Does not appear to be a way to export ad blocked sites \u2013 although you can click at a point in time on the bubble chart and see the ad sites blocked for a specific point in time. Does not appear a way to \u2018exclude\u2019 a system from adblocking (that would solve my smart TV issue\u2026)4) QoS: On day one of getting the device - I set this up. ON day three, when I wet to the QoS settings, I get the \u201cWelcome to QoS\u201d page. I looked at it 3-4 times, and never got the \u2018welcome\u2019 page before til day 3. QOS display just has broad classifications of applications, does not appear a way to edit the classifications, or add/delete/edit them.5) Network Monitor: Same as point 4 on the \u201cwelcome\u201d page.6) \u201cNetwork Monitor\u201d shows information in the aggregate, you cannot (on this page) identify a top consumer. Why? Because what little \u201cdevice\u201d information there is not an IP address, or a system name (7/8 say \u201cunnamed device\u201d). I had a Nintendo Switch online \u2013 but it did not show up here on this page.7) \u201cDevice Manager\u201d \u2013 you may see a device name, you do see a MAC address, you DO NOT see the current/most recent device IP unless the device is online \"at the moment\". Most home users can connect the dot w/ a system name or IP, and may not know how to find a MAC address. Why show the MAC and not the most recent IP? OH \u2013 and I do see a \u201cNintendo Switch\u201d in this screen, but not others \u2026 so \u2026 the Identifier in this fancy map display isn\u2019t seen elsewhere, like the \u201ctraffic controller\u201d page \u2026 Oh no, wait, after 30 seconds, there it is in the list on the TC page \u2026 why the delay?8) The traffic controller page does not reliably populate \u2013 2/3x, it is blank, 1/3 there is no info when you get the page elements \u2013 all of which are devoid of data. This is a page where you \u2018configure\u2019 properties \u2013 so it being empty is OK. It is not OK that a page with no data for its areas does not initially paint.9) The \u201cwireless status\u201d don\u2019t tell you the number of connected devices. Every other router I've used does.10) LOGS: There are two places where you see logs \u2013 Setup | Monitoring ) Logs and Sys Info | Logs (bottom). These areas display \u2026 different information. (so they are different logs, but not labeled that way) The first just has DHCP logs. The second is system level activity. Aside from copy/paste (into notepad?) doesn\u2019t appear to be a way to export/save logs, although there is an \u2018email logs\u2019 button \u2013 but NOT on the Sys Info | Logs area!11) ON the dashboard widget that shows \u201cInternet Status\u201d you see the ISP IP, you do not see the DNS servers \u2013 have to go to the setup area for that. When you resize the widget you get an error \u201cMissing JSON response\u201d - QA should have caught that.12) The \u201cBlock Sites\u201d does not take a list off the Internet, you would need to edit each entry by hand. QA should have *DEFINITELY* CAUGHT THAT. Many other devices do this, lower than this price point, and PiHole does it for free. So does OpenDNS (for the most part), and NextDNS is $20/yr.13) The \u201cBlock Service\u201d function doesn\u2019t block a \u201cservice\u201d, it blocks a TCP or UDP port. Services can run on any port, this section is poorly named.14) The \u201cEmail\u201d address config page does not appear to have any ability to work with MFA enabled services \u2013 I did not try here, just reporting what I see on the page. (MFA may work, no idea\u2026)15) UPDATES: When you press the \u201ccheck update\u201d button, you get \u2026 black text on a dark read background, which is barely readable. You also aren\u2019t told if you are current or not. SO \u2013 the user doesn\u2019t know if they need to .. update. QA should have caught that. Most other areas have white text on the dark red background.16) NTP \u2013 one server only, not multiple, can be defined.17) PING HEAT MAP: This is supposed to be a shining area o/t product. I have Five (5) entries selected in the list for the heat map \u2013 a pencil icon shows. Cannot figure a way to change that. SOME times when you click on pencil, you get a \u201cRPC error 'ERROR_UNKNOWN': cannot open //data/dumaos/rapp-data/com.netdumasoftware.pingheatmap/data/usr/custom_1651432715.lua: No such file or directory -> stack traceback: ?: in function \u2026..\u201d error message. Sometimes you get to create / edit a list. Inconsistent.18) Other \u2013 I could not find a way to change the system color scheme, you are stuck with a fairly garish \u201cred\u201d scheme. AND \u2026 I do have \u201caccessibility\u201d checked as \u201con\u201d. (I could see no difference with this checked on or off).ORIGINAL Post:Had it for two days. WOW - buggiest code EVER!!!! Took me several attempts to create my own 'ping' list. AND ... then it doesn't work. Can't tell you how many parts / panels generate a JSON / Javascript error. Seems that very little QA was done. Super Un Happy.",

The included DUMAos has made changing router settings very easy and also has an app that can be downloaded to any smartphone. The Nighthawk app also allows you to monitor your network on the go as well. Overall a great purchase.",
