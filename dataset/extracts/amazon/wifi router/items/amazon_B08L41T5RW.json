I checked the reviews and specs of this router and decided to purchase it, since it met and exceeded my requirements . My first impression was WoW. This router is well made and built to last, just like my last one. That by itself is a big plus. I looked over the manual and since I needed a Bridge connection on this router, I chatted with Aimee at Linksys instead. She talked me through the setup process and I was up an running in less than 30 minutes. I'm very happy with the help I received and I'm extremely happy with this new router. I've checked for the Wi-Fi coverage and dead spaces and so far it has exceeded my expectations. At the edges of my home, I'm still getting 3 out 4 bars of signal strength. That being said, I don't think I'll need the mesh feature in my home but if I ever want to go extreme, like out in the yard, I have that feature just waiting to be found. I find the Linksys MR9600 router extremely powerful for my use and recommend it to new and old Network DIYers alike. Good Luck and Safe Browsing.",

The router died on its second day and Linksys was unable to honor their 90-day warranty. The representative said never to buy refurbished because they are unable to handle any hardware issues and only offer technical support.Unfortunately, since Belkin's acquisition, Linksys support has declined.

                "reviewText": "I purchased this product to enhance the signal throughout my house, which is two stories and around 1800 square feet. I have AT&T fiber optic and a router modem provided to me by AT&T, which does not put out the best wifi signal. I happened to purchase the LINKSYS MR9600-RM2 DUAL-BAND MESH ROUTER brand new for 250$ from Sam's Club and was not impressed. I noticed this same router renewed on Amazon for 167$ and gave it a shot. I disabled the wifi signal on the AT&T router modem and set up the renewed LINKSYS MR9600-RM2 DUAL-BAND MESH ROUTER as the main wifi router and it works great!! The signal and the speed have improved in the areas of the house where they were once just average. I highly recommend this refurbished/renewed product. Easy to set up and the Linksys app is user friendly.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:1. This was a refurbished item yet it looked like brand new.2. It worked; i.e., not DOA out of the box.3. Very fast.4. Strong signal.5. Good customer service.Cons:1. No documentation or instructions. Only a Quick start guide that said to download the app. Worthless info for people who do not have IOS or Android.2. You have to create an account with Linksys in order to use the app.3. The router would not work until it was activated with an email link from Linksys.I was able to set the router up easily using the app, but had questions about having to use the app. Every other Linksys router that I've owned was configurable via a web browser and no internet connection.I called CS and a very nice girl in Manila guided me through the browser admin steps.You must first type 192.168.1.1 into the address field and hit enter.A window will open telling you to download the app.There is a link below that that says \"Continue to Linksys Smart Wi-Fi\".Click on that and it will take you to a log in window where you will enter the 5 digit Recovery Key found on the bottom of the router.It will take you to another page.In the lower far right corner there is a link that's labeled \"CA\".Click on that and the configuration page will appear, finally.Reset your admin password so that you don't have to use the Recovery Key the next time you want to administer the router.It can be the same password as the wifi login password.Now you can do anything that the app can do, but lots faster and more securely.Linksys obviously wants to push everyone toward their app, for the usual reasons.This feature already exists, so they should have included instructions on how to access it.If this refurbished router holds up over time then it will be a great bargain.",

                "reviewText": "Had Google WiFi router (1st gen) for few years and it worked fine in old days. It became most unreliable with dropping signals now and make it difficult to attend meetings. Explored few months for possible ling term future agnostic router and this one fit the bill. Signal is stable and providing reliable consistent performance and 3x speed than what Google Wifi offered same location. Only thing I need to see if it can last at least 5 years as Google WiFi did 7 years for me.",
