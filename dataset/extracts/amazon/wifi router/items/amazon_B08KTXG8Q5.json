It took a little getting used; the app was new to me being accustomed to viewing the router settings from a computer interface, but once queued up, it worked well and is proving useful. Had a little trouble re-connecting Brother printers, if you have those, READ AND CAREFULLY FOLLOW BROTHER'S INSTRUCTIONS, USING BROTHERS TOOLS, or you will have a lot of trouble. Any way, once configured the router is fast and steady with plenty of capacity. I hope it will be more resistant to lightning, than the other two I have lost. I did not get the security plan, I DO NOT NEED ANY MORE PEOPLE RUNNING TO ME WANTING MORE MONEY. THANKS ANYWAY. BUT IF YOU WANT IT- HELP YOURSELF.",

                "reviewText": "This had virtually no set up instructions, but I just swapped cords from the old one into the new one and somehow it worked-- YAY! Great signal, worked like a charm until it didn't. It could have been a power surge, but it was plugged into a surge protector and nothing else was impacted. I thought I might still be in the return window, but I ordered on Sept 21, started using it on Sept 25 and now on Oct 31 I find that I need to buy a new router. Bummer. Not 100% sure if its a bad product or not, since it did work great for about 5 1/2 weeks. I'd rate it 5 stars for the 5.5 weeks, but 1 star for dying so quickly. To be fair, gracious, I'm settling on a 4 star review.",

I looked through the specs and this one looked good and the price was right. Installation wasn't too bad and was done in 30 minutes. When I ran a speed check on my phone, I couldn't believe the difference. Upload was 30Mps and the download was 299Mbs. I ran it 4 times to make sure and it went up every time up to 310Mbs. House is a little over 2,000 sq.ft. and there was not very much drop off anywhere in the house. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 (6)",

I downloaded the app, plug my name, email and phone in and the app couldn't connect to the router. Instead, I got a phone call from someone claiming to be the Tech Support. Needless to say, this person was useless and couldn't address the issue. I tried again next day and received another phone call. This time the person was pushy and rude, and at some point told me to \"stop wasting his time\" and return the router. He also claimed that someone got ahold of my password and there already 30 devises connected to the router and that's the limit. Then he offered to flash my router for additional money and when I refused and said that I'll instead consult my friend who's a network engineer, the \"tech support\" got mad and got offended that I didn't trust him with his \"expertise\". But again, the router once my buddy helped me to set it up properly, works like a charm.",
