I'm feeding it from a wired TP-Link Deco X-20 mesh in my bedroom and it works great!!! It was cheaper, and less hassle, than getting a new FireStick.",

One failed after a few months, so I ordered another replacement and opted for the refurbished. Amazon was GREAT and refunded a portion of my money on the failed router and applied it to the refurbished router, making it essentially free with a small refund to my account. Not only that, but this refurbished router has worked perfectly with no problems whatsoever. Highly recommended.",

Literally made me loss so much time and made my job way harder since i had to work without wifi because this piece of crap needed internet connection to work\u2026 it sucks and i don\u2019t know why are there so many people giving so nice reviews and saying \u201cit took 10 minutes so set up\u201d maybe it was just meant for them and for their perfect environment\u2026 also it has to be liked to an account to work\u2026 it is just so bad and useless\u2026",

                "reviewText": "This review is probably premature, I literally just connected the devices and I\u2019m extremely impressed!I do not like buying used goods but this is my second refurbished purchase through Amazon that seems to be perfect!The device set up is so simple. You literally download the app, plug it in just follow the app. All I remember doing is clicking \u201cnext\u201d and the app found my eero devices.I had just purchased another mesh Wi-Fi router (Tenda Nova) and had just re-routed all my cameras to those devices and a few home devices, but the second node in the Tenda Nova kept dropping. The good thing is the way my house is set up, one Tenda Noca box could handle everything but I really wanted to maximize coverage in my house so I was set on two nodes and decided to try the eero system. I was re-routing my cameras and other devices but I didn\u2019t even have to the eero system picked them up and added them! Thank goodness! Note: I used same name and Wi-Fi password as before. Saved me some headache because my outdoor camera reset button is in an awkward place : / .One thing I notice however is all my devices are picking up on one of the eero\u2019s instead of the nearest devices going to the closest eero. This is the same observation I noticed on the Tenda Nova system. I\u2019m thinking that the layout of my house doesn\u2019t really need two nodes. I\u2019ve always only had one modem-router combo in my house provided by my ISP provider and the box covered my 3,000 sq foot home. I think this is because my house layout. The rooms all kind of border my main living and game room so when my box is in the center if he game room or family room I pretty much get internet in all the surrounding rooms. With this in mind I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll keep both unless I figure out a layout that pushes more coverage in my front and back yard.Great product not sure why I\u2019m so late to this other than my ISP modem worked really well and I kept getting promotions to waive the rental fee , but after years of promotions my ISP is putting their foot down and I refuse to pay the rental fee. In any case no regrets!I paired this with a refurbished Arris router also sold by Amazon. I\u2019m getting slightly higher download Mbps than I pay for!Happy customer! :)))))",
