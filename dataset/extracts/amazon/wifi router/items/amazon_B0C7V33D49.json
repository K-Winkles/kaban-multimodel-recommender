                "reviewText": "I don't write reviews often, but this needs to get one. Seems to provide good signal, but the flip-up/down hinge has \"steps\" in them that lock the antenna in 0/45/90 degree position. The transition between these steps is not smooth and they require quite high amount of force to break off from the current step, especially the one from 0 degree/full flat to 45 deg up/down, that could literally snap the Wi-fi male receptor/post off from the motherboard.Given that you are very likely have to flatten the antenna to install it, the post-install flip up/down is the one with highest chance of causing failure, so exercise it with caution.",
