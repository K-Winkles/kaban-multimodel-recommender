                "reviewText": "I set this router up using GNCC's router interface (192.168.8.1) via web browser to set it up for Access Point mode. After a few minutes of letting it load and then manually configuring it to how I wanted, I connected it to my main router and placed it in the same room as my desktop PC. I created a different 5GHz SSID to be specifically only used for my Quest 3 VR headset.I tested it out using the Oculus app to Airlink for PCVR, at 72hz, 1.5x resolution. It set the max fixed bandwidth the Oculus app allowed (200mbps). I started up SteamVR to play Valheim (VR mod + texture/mesh mods), and unlike before, I had no issues; it works perfectly now!Honestly for $35. Buying this was a no brainer, considering every other \"new\" Wifi 6 router I seen on Amazon right now is $75-300. I was happy to see that it had gigabit WAN and LAN ports to allow me to connect my desktop to it, getting the same speeds as my main router.EDIT: I did a performance test with the router to measure the bandwidth I was actually getting while using Virtual Desktop app on my Quest 3. I can confirm I was streaming a solid 1200Mbps from my desktop connected to the router, and from the router to my VR headset (5G Wi-Fi) with no obstructions up to 15 feet. Upon a second test, but with having three walls and an HVAC unit (metal object) about 45 feet from the router, I was still getting about 600-800Mbps. So I can personally say that its \"up to 2000 sq ft\" is accurately \"as advertised\".",

                "reviewText": "This is probably the cheapest wifi 6 router on Amazon. It covers my 2400 square ft home well.On the other hand, its speed is mediocre at best. I bought it to replace my TP-Link AC1700. I don't see much improvement of speed. I do have a couple of devices with wifi6 adapters. But their speeds remain the same.The web interface mostly works well, although it has some oddities. The interface switches between phone and PC randomly, regardless of which browser used (Chrome/Firefox/Edge). Also at the some places, the interface is confusing, e.g., the on-off buttons. It took me a while to find out how to turn a feature on and off.Also the smart integrated SSID feature behaves in a strange way. It seems to switch between 2.4G and 5G randomly for each client, regardless of how close the device is to the router.Overall, despite the flaws, it is a good router given the price.Update: I did a speed test. I connected this router (GNCC) and an old router (D-Link DIR-3040 triband AC 3000) both to my home server. Then I ran iperf tests from a laptop, located two rooms away, to the two routers. Here are the results:GNCC: 76/76 mbpsDIR-3040: 339/182 mbpsYou see that the old DLink is more than 4 times as fast as this one in download and 2 times as fast in upload.I bought the DLink in 2019. Even during that time, it is only a midrange wifi5 router. So this router is much slower than a 4-year old wifi5 router. Also, if your internet speed is over 100 mbps, this router might turn out to be a bottleneck.",

My mother thought she accidentally did something to make it not work, so we paid a tech person to come check out everything as the home security system and other things rely on the home wi fi. After hours and hours of troubleshooting, the tech suggested mom replace the router. She did so reluctantly because this one is less than 6 months old. The new router was the answer.",

I can see their device from next door, it is not as strong as mine, but theirs is located on shelf that has wall with metal edging and the device would have to be moved to pass a similar signal.None of this is an issue as I do not need that wifi, and everything in their house works and has better speeds than before,Life is good, and no more complaints over slow speeds from my son who games insistently.I will go over and check out interface and see how it compares to mine and other routers, if it passes my standards I will not return to update, if it does not...",

                "reviewText": "I'm a bit slow when it comes to setting up routers and things, so essentially just pulled out my old one, put the new one in its place and ran the set up through my browser. Was pretty easy, although there were a few terms the interface threw at me that they didn't really explain well, but still got it up and running. Still got the same \"no gigabit connection\" warning in my Virtual Desktop app, so swapped out for another cable (completely forgot until just now as I'm typing this, that the new router actually came with a cat5 cable, I'd just swapped out the old for the new using all the existing cables), this time a Cat8, same issue, then figured out that to get the best connection, to connect the PC directly to the router with said Cat8 cable. Then the video on the item page explained how to make the connections for the rest of it. Ta-dah! No more error messages in Virtual Desktop. My first time using a non well known brand for my router, so I'm hanging on to my old one just in case, but so far it seems to be working fine.",
