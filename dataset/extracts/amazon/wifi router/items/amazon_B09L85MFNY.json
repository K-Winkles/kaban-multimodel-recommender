Set up your powerline network with no configuration required to start enjoying fast, seamless wired and wireless connection in minutes.The terms \u201cAV1000\u201d and \u201c1000Mbps\u201d are derived from applicable specifications and refer to the theoretical maximum physical-layer data transfer rate. Those terms are used on this product solely to indicate its compatibility with other \u201cAV1000\u201d or \u201c1000Mbps\u201d powerline devices. Actual data speeds vary and may be limited by the product\u2019s Ethernet port and other network conditions such as data traffic, electrical noise, and wiring issues. For better performance, powerline devices should be deployed on the same electrical circuit and rated for the same HomePlug standard. A minimum of two powerline devices are required to establish a powerline connection. If you are uncertain about your network conditions, you should consult an IT professional to assist in selecting a networking product. Maximum wireless transmission rates are the physical rates derived from IEEE Standard 802.11 specifications. Range and coverage specifications along with the number of connected devices were defined according to test results under normal usage conditions.",

This time in the USA the setup is fully automated - literally plug and play, you don't even need to press a button. I was surprised that this time there is a zero loss of speed, before it was not transmitting full speed over powerline, now the speed is exactly the same as from the main router. And powerline extender is totally superior vs wireless extender. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I had high hopes for this after reading some of the reviews. After getting the unit, they paired pretty quickly in the same room. Wifi speed as at most 45mb/s so decided to try wired. Wired at most was 45mb/s :(Upgraded the firmware hoping that it would be better. The tplink management web interface said it had negotiated \"150mb/s\" for powerline.Tried multiple different plugs throughout the house and it got consistently worse. It did not connect back to the master unit by my media center when plugged directly into the wall. Tried a few different bedrooms and it didn't work either. Found a single plug in the kitchen where it did work, but at this location only got 4mb/s.Nowhere near the rated speed of 1000mb/s in the specs. Best to avoid this and save yourself trouble. For comparison, i get 500mb/s speedtest using the wireless mesh network (5ghz) which is the limit of my internet speed. Was hoping to use this where the wireless coverage is lacking or too far, but will have to come up with something else.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted Internet access in my workshop - it's two floors below my WiFi access point and between the flooring, ductwork and so forth, I've had little luck getting a reliable signal there. I don't need massive speed, so my first thought was powerline networking. I've had good luck with TP-Link powerline products in the past, so I figured I'd try it.The biggest problem I had was that the product I received was obviously returned by a previous owner. I can say this definitively because instead of using the default SSID and password on the label, it was configured to the SSID \"DavesGarage\" with an unknown password...clearly, someone had deployed this product and returned it to Amazon, but nothing in the product description told me I was paying for a used product.I was also surprised at the performance limitations of this device. I have an older TP-Link powerline adapter that works well, but lacks WiFi (it's just two wired gigabit ethernet ports). I get about 700 megabits to this device and that's more than enough for my needs. I was expecting this newer WPA7617 to be as fast or faster, but that's not the case.On the wired ports of the WPA7617, I'm getting about 100 megabits - maybe 10% of the advertised speed. Connected to WiFi, I get about 30 megabits on the 2.4 GHz band, and about 50 megabits on the 5.0 GHz band. I thought perhaps the issue was the location where I have the device, so I moved the WPA6717 to the same location where I have my other powerline adapter and unplugged the older one. No change - still roughly 10% of the promised throughput. I also tried moving my older TP-Link receiver to my workshop, and it did fine there - about 700 megabits.Thinking it might be a problem to have two separate powerline networks going, I also tried pairing the receiver in the WPA7617 kit with my existing powerline network...again, no chancg in performance. I was impressed that this configuration worked (that is, one sender connecting to two receivers), but it didn't seem to make a difference from a performance perspective.Other negatives I'll mention are that the device runs a bit hot, it's big enough to block both outlets in a normal junction box, and it doesn't support any of the recent WiFi standards. There's no 802.11AC, AX, etc...the latest you get is 802.11n - a 15-year old standard that emerged in 2008.On the positive side, it is fairly inexpensive and once I understood how to reset the device back to factory defaults to clear the configuration that the previous owner had set, the setup process went smoothly. I had it up and running in just a few minutes, and the connection seemed to be solid (albeit slow).In summary, I suppose the fact that I was shipped a used product masquerading as new isn't TP-Link's fault...I'll blame Amazon for that one. But dramatically slower performance than advertised is troubling, and even though that's not necessarily a show-stopper for me,I just can't recommend this product. I'd definitely recommend trying other brands instead.",
