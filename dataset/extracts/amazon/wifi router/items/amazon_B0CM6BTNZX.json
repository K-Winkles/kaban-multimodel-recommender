Wi-Fi 6E extends the frequency bands to the 6 GHz range, allowing additional channels to minimize interference. The benefits of Wi-Fi AC (802.11ac) include: Utilization of the 5 GHz band for higher speeds and reduced interference.Standardized beamforming for targeted signal steering.Increased modulation (from 64QAM to 256QAM) for more bandwidth.New channel widths of 80 MHz and 160 MHz, doubling and quadrupling the bandwidth compared to Wi-Fi N.Support for up to 8 streams in MIMO, further enhancing over Wi-Fi N. The introduction of Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) brings additional improvements in efficiency, speed, and capacity. Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) allows access points to effectively communicate with multiple devices simultaneously. WiGig (802.11ad) specializes in extremely high speed over short distances and is mainly used for wireless docking stations in enterprises. Interoperability issues may arise, especially with different frequency bands. However, most routers are dual-band, allowing the use of various Wi-Fi standards. Backward compatibility exists as long as devices operate on the same frequency band. In practice, throughput is halved compared to theoretical speed, and the 2.4 GHz band may be congested in urban areas. For more demanding applications such as HD video streaming, 5 GHz WiFi is often recommended. When choosing WiFi for smartphones, tablets, and laptops, considering the supported antennas and streams is important to achieve maximum speed.",

                "reviewText": "It's surprisingly hard to definitively test an antenna, so I went waaay above and beyond to get reliable repeatable real-world results. WiFi signals fluctuate a LOT, so you can't simply look at signal strength with one antenna, and then with another. Variability, for one antenna alone, can be +/-10dBm. In order to completely rule that out, I wrote a custom program to sample signal strength, 500 times, calculating the mean, mode, and average. Instead of measuring just one connection, to my home router, I recorded 500 samples, for every hotspot in the neighborhood (3 at 5.8Ghz, 3 at 5Ghz, 18 at 2.4Ghz). I choose 500 samples, because that was the number of samples it took to overcome outlier readings, swings from high to low, cross station interference, and other influences. The average, at 500 samples, reliably matched (within 1dBm) the average for another 500 samples, for all 24 hotspots. My efforts didn't stop there. I ran the test again with the antenna base rotated 90 degrees (still pointing up), and with the laptop's internal antennas/screen rotated 90 degrees. With the first test, these antennas gave a 2-3dBm boost, and with the rotated position, they gave a 3-5dBm boost. It took a couple of days, to get the analysis program written, but it's awesome to finally have solid definitive numbers to compare. I'd say this is a good antenna that will definitely improve signal strength. Keep in mind that laptop Wi-Fi antennas usually perform quite well, because they are built into the screen, and have a reasonable length to them. If you are replacing stubby style antennas, that come with desktop Wi-Fi cards, you should see even more improvement than what my tests show. Those stubby antennas are terrible, and they are stuck behind the signal blocking metal PC case. You'll do much better with this antenna, mounted up and away from the case. Enjoy.",

The Dd long cable allows you more leniency to place the antenna closer or farther away. The base of the antenna has a magnet which can be a plus if you have a place to stick it.

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Works better than the stock motherboard antenna",
                "reviewText": "I wasn't really in the need for a new antenna since the one that came with my Asrock Z490 Taichi motherboard worked good enough. But I've never tried an aftermarket one so I thought I'd give it a shot.What I like about it.It has a strong magnet. There's no issue whatsoever of it falling off of at least a ferrous metal case. The stock antenna had nothing to hold it on. At least not natively. I'd of had to have used something like double sided tape if I wanted to stick it to the side or back. Plus the antenna can only be pointed vertically from its base. So I just had it on top and I ended up knocking it off often so this is nice that that won't be an issue anymore. It's also nice having it off the top since now none of the top exhaust fan is blocked. I mean the stock antenna was hardly blocking a lot of air, but hey some is more than none last time I checked. As shown in the pics by running the \"netsh wlan show interface\" command in the command prompt, this now lets my motherboard pick a 5 GHz channel instead of the 2.4 GHz. 2.4 is better for things like going through walls more easily which is why my motherboard picks it since the PC is upstairs and the router is downstairs, but 5 is faster. So though it's saying the signal strength is lesser, it's lesser on the better option and is still easily a high enough signal strength. The two antenna are moveable and lock in 3 places. Vertical, horizontal, and a 45 degree. The 360 degree rotation of them stays in place in whichever angle you put them at instead of letting gravity making them fall.What I don't like about it.I would have liked to see a longer cable which would allow more placement options. It's longer than the stock but only by about 2-3 inches which amounts to nothing meaningful.But that's a small gripe and this is still better than the stock antenna despite that Taichi motherboard being Asrock's 2020 flagship motherboard model. So I'm happy with this.",

                "reviewText": "This is an excellent antenna and attaches to the motherboard antenna ports easily. I got excellent Wifi6 signal with great speeds. The magnetic base keeps it in place nicely. The design of the antenna is also very cool and looks very sci-fi and futuristic.This replaces the antenna that came with my motherboard. It is always on the floor in two pieces as it is designed to have two plastic pieces snap together but always falls over and detaches.Only criticism that I have is that the base is huge and the magnet is not strong enough to hold on to partial portion of the base. When you do put it on the side, it does hold it but a small nudge and it might slide to the floor. Other magnetic antennas have a smaller base but a stronger magnet that can attach firmly to the side of the case. Since my case has glass on both sides, there is not much space for it to grab on to. I put it on top of the case which blocks a little bit of the airflow from the AIO but it is better than flopping around in the ground.Overall, great huge antenna as a good replacement for wifi antennas that come with motherboards.",

                "reviewText": "I bought an antenna almost exactly like this before. The base on the one I purchased said EDUP. This one had a QC-passed sticker over the same area. I removed it and it said EDUP under it. So the base is shaped the same but the antennas are a little different shape but work essentially the same. The only difference I can see is that the magnet in the base of the new one is much weaker than the older one. I am happy with the increased Wi-Fi signal performance just like with the older one but am not happy with the weaker magnet. If you wanted to slap this on the side of your PC case it would not stay in place as well as the older one would. Other than that I'd recommend this antenna.",
