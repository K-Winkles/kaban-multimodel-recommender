                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great value mesh solution!",
                "reviewText": "I am an experienced network tech and am more than happy with the Tenda Nova solution. First, price - I purchased two three packs for the special price of $120. One was for a neighbor and the other for me. A brief word regarding the two houses these units were placed in. My neighbor and I both live in Ecuador. Almost all houses here have concrete wals, floor, and ceilings. This makes connectivity throughout a house extremely difficult. My neighbors house is approximately 3,000 sq feet and relatively thin and long. Her ISP\u2019s connection is at the extreme end of the house and she has never had reliable connectivity at the opposite end of the house. My house is a three story building. I have always had a wifi router placed in my attic, and a repeater on the first floor. The performance on the first floor was spotty AND streaming video in my TV room on the second floor (Roku) was inconsistent at best.Setup - I had already downloaded the Tenda IOS app prior to receving the units so I was ready to go. Plugged in the first unit and received a notification that it was using a DHCP connection in less than a minute. Then it was time to add the next two units. Because the Tenda units are pre-linked all that is required is that you locate the two companion units in a suitable location and wait while they boot up and connect. I have significant experience with Google Wifi and Eero and although I love both of these products their setup is a bit more involved. Also, because the Tenda units are pre-linked (and the notice to simply plug in the 2 additional units is rather small) users might try to use the Tenda app feature to add another Tenda unit (which will fail). Just follow the directions and plug the other two units in, check they have a good signal, and you\u2019re good to go.Performance - living in Ecuador bandwith is expensive. My neighbor only has a low speed DSL connection at 5Mbps (on a good day) mine is a fiber connection at 50Mbps. Many of the online performance tests for the Tenda unit put them a little below or above the Google wifi product and below the Eero. For the speeds we have here in Ecuador the aggregate throughput of the Tenda is MORE than ample. In my neighbor\u2019s house i had 100% wifi signal throughout the entire house. A solid 3.5Mbs on speedtest throughout the house (this is her typical wired performance with DSL). Similar experience in my house. A consistent 49Mbps everywhere.IOS App - the Tenda app is almost identical in look to the Eero application. I don\u2019t like the upload/download indicators at the top of the Tenda app as much as Eero\u2019s bandwidth testing results. Tenda\u2019s app gives you an instantaneous measurement rather than a bandwidth test history (which I prefer). I also wish there was a restart option to reboot the units (although I haven\u2019t yet had any need to reboot anything). Nice and simple app that gives you access to the basic things you need. If you\u2019re a tech or advanced user used to a web based router interface with access to deep features this will be dissapointing but that\u2019s not who or what this sytem (or Google wifi, eero, etc) is geared towards.Tech support - I have seen some negative comments in people\u2019s reviews of Tenda\u2019s tech support. I had no need to speak with technical support during or after purchase (yet). I did however contact them prior to purchase to ask some questions. Got through instantly. The agent realized my questions were more technical than she could answer and suggested I speak with an engineer who she promised would call back. Got a call later that day and got knowledgeable answers to my questions.In summary, the product in my experience is a great, low cost, mesh solution. Incredibly easy to install. Decent application. Good tech support. Great performance (for my situation). Amazing value for the money. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "These set of 3 mesh network routers solved the lack of adequate reception in portions of an apartment house I own. I first set up and tested the system in my own home so I'd be more efficient at the apartment house. The Tenda app for iPhones made it easy to change the SSID and network password so I didn't have to give my tenants a new network information. I did have to power cycle the cable modem to get everything working at the apartments. I tested the network at various locations throughout the building. The signal was very strong everywhere and the download and upload speeds were fantastic. My tenants are very pleased with the quality of the WiFi signal they have now. I highly recommend this product. (I didn't rate tech support, because I didn't need to use tech support but I noted that the product identified a tech support phone number.)",

                "reviewText": "After two days of using the Nova configuration that I purchased, it\u2019s mostly positive thoughts. My house is not large\u2014approximately 1,600 sqft, two stories. However the family room on the first floor is on a slab with no second floor above it, and it has plagued me with WiFi issues. So, my main goal for this product was to provide more stable WiFi for the family room. My secondary goal was to have better coverage on my property as well so I can enjoy WiFi coverage on my deck or in my yard. To those points, this product has provided excellent coverage and improved the stability of my WiFi network compared to my old setup of a main router and Netgear extender.Pros:- the Smart Assistant feature is great for setting up devices that can only connect to the 2.4 GHz band (like my WeMo). The WeMo devices are totally different headache so don\u2019t get my started.- extremely easy setup following the little quick start booklet that was included with the box as well as the app instructions.- no obvious handoff issues between nodes as I walk through my house.Cons:- the lack of LAN ports on the back of the hub. However, I repurposed my older router as an Ethernet switch which resolved that issue (I\u2019m not very networking savvy, but YouTube works wonders on setting that up)- I definitely see a speed drop off. I\u2019m with Spectrum and rated for 100 mbps download and 15 mbps upload (I think). I definitely don\u2019t get those speeds when connected to the nodes, but for streaming Netflix, Hulu, etc., even if I\u2019m down to 20 mbps, it\u2019s still more than sufficient.- for some reason, the Tenda app shows that I am connected to a node further away in the house than the one I\u2019m very close to. Not sure why it does that, but since my speeds and coverage are still adequate, I\u2019m not overly concerned.- the node sizes are quite large, and if you want to utilize their built-in LAN port, you can\u2019t have anything plugged into the adjacent outlet. I wish they had designed the unit to have the port on the side or top, but oh well.Hopefully it continues to provide stable, long-term coverage; however, if the product quality diminishes in the future, I\u2019ll make an effort to update my review. Hopefully this helps anyone looking to purchase this product!Update #1 (6/1/20): After using the Nova MW5 for about 2-3 weeks, my only real complaint is the issue with my Echo Dot. While streaming my favorite live radio stations, the audio stream frequently stutters and drops. I tried reconnecting my Dot to the Nova network on the 5 GHz band, but the Dot reverts back to the 2.4 GHz band. My dot has line of sight to one of the Nova nodes so I\u2019m not sure why there is an issue. What is even more odd is the regular Echo has no problems streaming the live radio stations. It\u2019s still not a deal breaker for me for the price of this system but certainly disappointing. Other than that, the mesh network continues to operate well.Update #2 (6/29/20): I\u2019ve noticed that my Belkin WeMo smart plugs will randomly not turn on some nights or not turn off some nights. The WeMos have been troublesome since I bought them (terrible software), but they were usually fairly stable once set up with my standard WiFi setup; however, on this mesh network, I typically have at least 1-2 issues per week. It\u2019s frustrating, but I\u2019ll still maintain the 4-star review due to the pros far outweighing the nagging cons.",
