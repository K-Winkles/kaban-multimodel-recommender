                "reviewText": "For those curious, I was able to successfully establish a 5 Ghz connection from 1.1 km away with perfect signal strength, 80% link quality, and up to 520 Mbps Tx/Rx speeds (per Realtek USB Wireless LAN Utility) connected to the QGOO USB 3.0 dual band WiFi dongle. I then successfully established a 2.4 Ghz connection from 1.2 km away with perfect signal strength and link quality and up to 130 Mbps Tx/Rx speeds. Obviously, the distance achieved will vary greatly based on line-of-sigh obstacles, weather, and correctly positioning the antenna.I saw one negative review complaining that the back of the antenna isn't magnetic as advertised. There are 2 or 3 small magnets running vertically down the center of the back of the antenna but they aren't very strong. So be warned that, if it's going to work, you'll need a neodymium magnet strip and you may not be able to get the flexibility to position the directional antenna to your target access point.",

                "reviewText": "This was no better than the $9 direct screw-on 15\" antenna I bought from Amazon. My wi-fi camera is mounted on an outer building about 150' from the house modem. The original short camera antenna was \"spotty\" to the PC viewing and recording but the $9 antenna was a real improvement.I thought I could make an even better improvement with this antenna that I mounted on the roof of the outbuilding, whereas the camera is on the side under the roof overhang, so I had hopes for a clearer direct line of sight. Also, I felt this would be a higher quality antenna in itself to make an improvement.NO improvement at all - this one is more expensive for no benefit.The packaging came with no paperwork or instructions. There was NOT a second connector in the box as the product site here at Amazon showed - maybe for larger devices? There was included a little plastic bag of some extremely small parts - which I have no idea what they were.The product site here at Amazon said a 10' range - BUT that is the length of the cable to the antenna from where it screws into the camera.I returned this antenna.",

                "reviewText": "Did not find much boost on the 5ghz --maybe the difference from -84dB to -86dB so that was disappointing. Checked it on two different dates /times. But the 2.4 ghz went from -72dB gain to -62dB gain at a distance of 600 ft. compared to regular router antenna, non directional. I would have expected more gain but that was significant. Using with a TP Link outdoor access point.",

                "reviewText": "This setup is so intuitive you won't need the instructions. Previously there was virtually no cellular reception in my area, but with this unit I have 5 bars in Verizon and AT&T. I think it would probably work with any network, but I didn't try it with a laptop, since I use my phone as a hotspot anyway.",

                "reviewText": "All I did was swap one of these for one of the stock antennas on a cheap Trendnet N300 AP. Drilled a hole through the exterior wall and screwed the antenna mount to the side of the building. Big difference. I was barely able to connect to wifi across my property in a camper. If I was lucky, I would only get around 0.25Mbps and constantly disconnecting. Now I can maintain the connection and get 5-10Mbps. I might screw around and mount this antenna up higher in the future to get much higher speeds. It's good enough for now. Took 5 mins to install.Side note, I was using an Asus AC66U B1 as an access point until I found out the antennas are not detachable. I went with a Trendnet TEW-638APB and I'm happy with it connected to just one of these antennas. Unfortunately the trendnet AP is limited by a single 100Mbps ethernet port. Oh well.",

                "reviewText": "Used this to an old Hawking WiFi repeater which is on the inside of a large metal garage building where otherwise there's no WiFi or cell phone signal. Mounted this antenna on the outside of the building (on a pole above the building for signal strength actually) and ran the cord through the wall to the repeater. Works great. So now inside the building I can stream TV on the Fire Stick and utilize WiFi calling on my phone to get calls/texts where otherwise before I had a total dead zone for basically all communications.",
