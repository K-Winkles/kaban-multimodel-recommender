                "reviewText": "I purchased this router along with some CAT8 network cable. The primary purpose of my upgrade was the wifi router I had was not suitable for even a small home worth of square footage. It also was very bogged down by having multiple devices connected and this problem was significantly worse once we had a faster connection. The router would lose connectivity and the reconnection with the Starlink system was very slow. Using the auxiliary port on the Starlink router there was significant interference with channel cross talk on my personal router. It also takes a back seat to ping priority, if you are a gamer this is pretty important. The router I replaced is a Linksys EA7300. To sum it up in simple terms, the TP-Link AX6000 has a substantially stinger wifi signal. As well as being a much faster connection to the router itself.This router has the ability to run a static route. Which allows me to fully bypass the Starlink router. Thus solving the channel crosstalk and interference.The AX6000 seems to maintain a connection with the internet much better than both my personal router and the provided starlink router. If connection is lost at the dish and regained. There is NO reconnection hiccup down stream. Dips in connectivity are almost seamless. This was a major drawback on my personal router, less on the provided starlink router.The wifi speeds overall have improved, by magnitudes at even short distances or through minimal obstruction. No, it did not increase the speed of starlink, but it absolutely allows all the devices to now experience full speed of the network with out issues.For gaming specifically, I had and interesting experience with the connection using the Starlink or my personal router. Either plugged in via ethernet or wifi. I would have a stellar connection and decent ping. But the connection would dip or drop during games and I would frequently lag out for multiple seconds. Many times per match. Or be disconnected all together. When I switched to the tp link router, I do not understand what magic is at play here other than prioritizing game packets to front of the line for better ping. But I do not lose connection any longer. It is super stable, I can host games. No issues at all.The user interface is excellent, very easy to set up and get a static route set up for my starlink satellite statistics.Overall, I am very happy with this router. I highly recommend it, specially if you are also a starlink customer.UPDATE: Bumped this up to 5 stars. I am very happy with this router.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars An Excellent Router; Highly Configurable",
                "reviewText": "After two months of use, I have come to the conclusion that this is an excellent router.A couple of months ago, I placed the order to upgrade our home internet to AT&T gigabit fiber and knew that I wanted a solid, configurable WIFI router as the only device plugged into the AT&T equipment. This way, I could setup a Raspberry Pi as Pihole to block ads on my entire network and use MAC IDs to allow/deny access to any devices that tried to connect.There are videos on YouTube that review this router and give you a view into the the setup/config screens so, I won\u2019t go into describing all of that. However, I will say that I feel the setup screens are intuitive and even if I did not have 20+ years\u2019 experience in IT (programming, DBA, sys admin, etc.) I believe I could figure out how to make this router fit my needs. Whether you have that kind of background or not, the YouTube videos can be very helpful.Wired ConnectionsThe previous owner of my house had it wired with CAT6 cable (thank you!) and I added a couple of CAT8 cable runs so, I am currently using 6 of this routers\u2019 8 gigabit ports. Those cables give me wired connections to multiple gigabit switches throughout the house (bedroom, office, man cave, living room, etc.) where I have wired connections to multiple computers or smart TVs or gaming systems, etc.I could bore you with upload/download numbers but, instead, I will just say that everything runs faster or better now than it did before all my upgrades.My smart TV connects to YouTube (Pihole blocks the ads) and videos play smoothly. My PS4 used to take an hour to download free games and now takes a couple of minutes and my Xbox is the same. System patches take a minute to download. Online streaming services run smoothly and I have yet to see any \u201cspinning wheels\u201d as a video buffers in the middle of an action scene.WIFIBefore AT&T fiber, I had an AT&T Airties 4921 WIFI booster that did a great job improving the signal to a \u201cdead spot\u201d in the back of the house. I tried and failed to get the 4921 to work on my new equipment then realized the AX6000 had already solved the dead spot problem. I have WIFI cameras pointing towards the woods behind my house or from the woods back to the house and am getting a strong signal to all devices.The router is capable of WIFI 6 but currently none of our iPhones, iPads, MacBooks or laptops can use it. Nevertheless, I have not noticed any connectivity issues with any of our wireless devices.I do have one wireless, multifunction HP printer that will go to \u201csleep\u201d after several hours of inactivity and may not wake up when I send a document to it from my smart phone. All I do is punch a button on it, it wakes up, accepts the document and everything is fine. This is probably a setup issue within the printer, and certainly not a WIFI problem, but has not been a big enough hassle for me to worry about it.Network MonitoringOne of the major things I wanted from this router is the ability to easily block devices on my network. I have a teenager who only needs occasional Internet access and I used both of the MAC IDs from their laptop (wired and wireless) to setup a weekly schedule for when it could/could not reach the Internet.I can see all wired/wireless devices on my network in the routers\u2019 Basic or Advanced screens and this allows me to keep an eye on who is in my network.Overall, I have been very pleased with this router and highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I replaced my 4 year old Synology router (by all means) a very good router, with the TP-Link ax6000 for greater Wi-Fi coverage. The antennas (8 of them) are a big plus. With the addition of devices (Computer, laptop, iPhone, iPad, smart TV, home smart devices, and my internet radio system in the garage) over the years, the router runs without a glitch in my three level house. The 8 Gigabit Ethernet port for my office configuration was also a must in my purchase decision. It sits in the corner of a room on the 3rd floor (definitely not the best place, but my home office is on the 3rd floor). The Wi-Fi coverage would be a lot higher if I could have it installed on the ground floor. It is easy to program and I also like the USB-C port connection (faster connectivity) that I use for a network drive. All in all, reliable, powerful and I\u2019m a happy camper!",

                "reviewText": "Tenia muchas dudas de comprarlo por los comentarios pero lo hice. Mi router es version 1 (V1) y a 6 semanas de instalarlo, ha funcionado perfecto. Al configurarlo se instalo una actualizacion de firmwate que salio a finales de Febrero 2021. La velocidad no aumento, tenia antes con modem de Telmex 200mb (fibra optica, modem doble banda Huawei, muy estable y bueno) y con este router sigo teniendo 200mb. Compre este router para tener mas alcance, y me sorprendio. La velocidad casi no se pierde auque estes lejos del router, y ahora la se\u00f1al llega a distancias que antes no. Por ejemplo, a 40 metros de distancia el router me da 50mb de velocidad conectado por wi-fi 6 (con modem telmex tenia menos de 20 metros de alcance). Antes en los lugares mas alejados con el modem telmex me llegaban 10mb, y ahora en ese mismo lugar 80mb. En resumen este router aumenta significativamente el alcance de la se\u00f1al, y la velocidad contratada casi no disminuye aun cuando no estes cerca. Trae muchas opciones de personalizacion, control paretal, seguridad, antivirus sin pagar suscripcion, red de invitados, etc. Muy buena compra hasta el momento con zero problemas de desconexion o interrupciones.",
