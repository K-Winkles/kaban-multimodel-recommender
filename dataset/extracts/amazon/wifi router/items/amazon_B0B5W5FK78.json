Internet connection speeds and availability depend on your internet service provider; if your internet service provider does not provide you with the maximum supported speed, you will not experience that maximum speed. Maximum network speeds, if applicable, reflect combined supported speeds across wired and wireless clients. Maximum wireless signal rates are derived from IEEE 802.11 standard. Specifications assume wired Ethernet connection; your experienced speed may vary when connected to an eero device that is configured as a wireless extender. Coverage estimates are based on normal use conditions. Actual range and performance can vary, and maximum supported speeds may not be available to all customers, due to factors such as local regulations (including power limits), network configuration, interference, connected devices, device usage, building materials, and obstructions. Specifications are based on use of a Wi-Fi 6 or later generation client device that supports 160 MHz. For more information about eero performance, visit support.eero.com. Combining eero 6+ devices with older generation eero devices on the same network may result in reduced performance across the network."

                "reviewText": "We have a 1500 sq ft home on Cape Cod with SimpliSafe security and cameras, video doorbell, ets. The Xfinity-provided wifi modem wasn't giving us reliable coverage for the doorbell cam and another camera on the garage at the other side of the house. I purchased a Motorola DOCSIS cable modem and got rid of the Xfinity modem, then connected this refurb eero system. Super-easy setup. App tells you if you're placing the satellite mesh devices in a good location. One thing to note: eero runs a 2.4ghz network and a 5ghz network simultaneously, and names both of them the same. If you have 2.4ghz-only devices (like my older Kindle, the SimpliSafe system, or Amazon Echo devices), you will probably have to use the eero app to PAUSE the 5ghz network and let your devices connect to the 2.4ghz. I did that initially when connecting these more-selective devices, and they seem to reconnect fine on their own now, HOWEVER, I occasionally have to manually PAUSE the 5ghz network to let the SimpliSafe base station reconnect. It's a bit annoying but not a deal-breaker. Also, the eeros all have 2 Ethernet ports on the back, so there's only 1 port available at the main router. I purchased an inexpensive unmanaged Ethernet switch for my desktop so I can get multiple devices plugged in. Overall, very satisfied with the performance. Cable internet is asymmetric; on wifi or hardline, I get roughly identical up/down speeds, so no complaints, although despite paying for \"gig speed\" from Comcast, I'm averaging 550 down and 25 up. supposed to be \"up to\" a gig down and 30 up. Meh. Spoiled by my Sonic gigabit fiber to the house in CA, I guess. ;-)",

                "reviewText": "When I first was setting these up there were a few technical glitches that I think can help you if you know out of the gate. I was to the point that I thought I was going to have to return these. Instructions in the app tell you to disconnect everything from your modem and restart it but it doesn\u2019t tell you is that you need to reboot your modem and let it power up on its own and make sure it\u2019s connected to the Internet THEN plug in your first eero and begin the set up process. If you do not do this then it will fail because it\u2019s trying to utilize the Internet to register the first device as the main gateway. It quickly registers and set up and asked you to name the Wi-Fi network. Then it prompts you for a firmware update to which you have the option to skip for now or update immediately. Since I had a three pack and I wanted to go ahead and set up the rest of the units first I chose to skip the firmware update as it said it could take up to 15 minutes. The problem is I guess because there was such a firmware gap from what it arrived with versus what it needed to be updated with that it would not allow any of the other units to see each other when you try to add them into the mesh. Literally no matter how close they were to each other it would fail and tell you that they were too far apart. It got to the point where I literally sat them next to each other and still got that error stating that they were too far apart in which I thought I was going to have to return the unit at that point. I decided as a last ditch effort to go ahead and perform the update on the initial main unit which is called gateway and after I did that every other eero Learned and perfectly and immediately no matter where I had them placed in my house.Definitely let your modem be connected fully to the Internet before powering up the first Gateway and definitely perform the firmware update on the first unit when prompted before learning in the rest and you shouldn\u2019t have any issues.Lastly I have an older laptop computer (like 5 years old) and it could not see the Wi-Fi 6 signal. I had to update the driver on my laptop network card and it was able to immediately see the network. So if you have any older computer that\u2019s also something you might want to know. You can usually very easily find the driver needed at your computers manufacture\u2019s website",
