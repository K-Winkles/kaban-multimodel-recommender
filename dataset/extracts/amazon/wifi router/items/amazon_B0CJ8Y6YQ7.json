I\u2019m glad I got it and I am impressed because it works really well. It\u2019s got 4 antennas which help it to cover up to 8000sq ft. I like that it is dual band because some of my devices only work on 2.4 while most of my other devices are on 5. There are a few different ways you can use it, too. It has a mode where you can extend coverage of your wireless network, a mode where you can use it as a router so it plugs directly into your modem, and another mode that I honestly don\u2019t really understand so I don\u2019t use it lol. I just have it so that it extends my existing wireless network and it\u2019s great. It also has built in ports for WAN and LAN, easy one button set up using the WPS button, a signal strength light, and lights that tell you what mode you\u2019re using. I haven\u2019t had any problems with connection to it and have not noticed any loss of speed or anything like that. And now I can finally use the wifi in the kitchen :).",
