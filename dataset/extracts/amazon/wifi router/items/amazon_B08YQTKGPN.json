                "reviewText": "I bought this router originally about 6 months ago, in a used \" very good \" condition, per Amazon Warehouse. I bought it for $15.50 (yes you are reading the price right $15.50) and it was in what I would characterize as being in \"Excellent\" condition. What a steal. It has a Quad Core Processor and consequently it does respond very quickly. It has \"4\", 6 dbi, antennas, which are extremely powerful, allowing for an exceptional wall penetration. Overall performance is Phenomenal. Moreover, within the past week, I bought a second Used Unit, said to be in Good condition for only $24.99 from Amazon Warehouse (to use as an additional Access Point). Therefore, in total I have spent a total of roughly $40 for two of these WiFi 6 routers. Again, nothing short of a steal. Quite frankly, I now have owned a total of \"7\" Tenda routers over many years. Obviously, I have been, and I am, very impressed with the Company, and the performance of their routers. I highly recommend this router, and too, I highly recommend Tenda as a Company.",

                "reviewText": "Independent testers listed the Tenda as having more bang for the buck. Reviews were mostly good, and Amazon had it on sale at a good price, so I ordered it. Upon receipt, the router was packaged in such a way that it seemed to be one that had been sold and returned with power wire and connection cable wadded up and protective coverings replaced at an angle with lots of bubbling underneath. I got started connecting it which was fairly simple and intuitive taking only a few minutes. It worked great, and I was happy -- for twenty minutes. After twenty minutes of use, my internet connection dropped and would not reconnect. I rebooted the modem, router and computer, but no connection was available. Maybe that's why it had been returned in the first place. With all the routers I have connected in the past, I have never had to sit on the phone with a helpful tech and didn't want to start. A router that connects easily and works well for twenty minutes should not need trouble shooting. I returned the Tenda to Amazon for a full refund and ordered an ASUS router to replace it. It was a little more expensive but way more dependable and a great deal faster than the Tenda. Now, I am a happy camper! Amazon was, as usual, very helpful and obliging with the return for which I am thankful. Unfortunately, I can't recommend the Tenda router and will never buy another one.",

After upgrading to this new router I started receiving 100ms with 2.4ghz and 200mbs with 5g. Obviously, this was a huge upgrade for me and worth the price.I previously had other routers before, but this is by far the easiest with installing. It pretty much took me 4-5 minutes. I didnt even have to connect any computer for ethernet connection. I just used my phone to connect and customize the SSID and password. Currently, getting solid connection from all over my house.For those who think their internet is slow, it might not be internet or the pc but the router.",

                "reviewText": "I just got my internet set up on Friday and so far this Tenda router has been working very well.I recently moved to a new apartment and my roommate had our internet upgraded. Our old router was not able to move on with the Verizon high speed internet any more. Therefore I bought this Tenda router. I first purchased it because it had beautiful shape and nice color. All my furniture is white so I\u2019d like to have the router in the same color. Most of the routers on Amazon was in black or grey\u2026I was a little bit worried that this router might not work with Verizon because I heard that happened to a lot of routers. That\u2019s also the reason why my roommate and I rent the router from Verzion for years. I\u2019m glad it has been working well (and it helps me saving the money of renting router every month). I do enjoy the high speed internet. I could not even open a 480P video stream in my old apartment with my old router but now I can watch TV shows in 1080P. That was a huge improvement of the quality of my life.",

I only have my ps4 hooked up via Ethernet and am getting about 300 mbps, which is better than I was getting with other routers. I live in a 1400 sq foot condo and the range is great in all rooms.

Others might need a modem depending on your setup.I have some experience with an older Tenda router, so I knew what to expect.
