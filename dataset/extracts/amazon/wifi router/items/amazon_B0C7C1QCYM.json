I needed more connections at a further distance for gaming and this was the answer to improve my experience with all devices.The picture may not seem all that impressive but I'm on wifi in a basement and I was only getting 40 mbps at one time. This is fast for wifi.",

                "reviewText": "The only way set-up could be easier is if it un-boxed and plugged itself in. Speeds are solid. The 5ghz channel actually speed tests about 15% faster than the max speed my internet provider says I should get (don't tell spectrum). With my previous set-up I needed a router and a satellite to cover my entire house. With this router I no longer need a satellite and I have a strong signal everywhere. The dedicated channels for smart home devices are also a nice addition.",
