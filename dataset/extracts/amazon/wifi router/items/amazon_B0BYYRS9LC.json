Late at night it wasn't bad but in the afternoon/evening the signal was often so bad that using the internet was pretty much undoable - not a good situation for me since I use tons of data between downloading games/videos & doing research/work on my multiple computers. Out of desperation I decided to try this product. I wasn't expecting much, but since setting this up my signal is definitely better and my data speeds are three to five times faster than what I've been getting before. There's noticeable slow downs during peak hours but I can still use the internet reasonably well, unlike before. So far it has been more than worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "Seller states in their handbook that if you use it as a repeater, that it will use half the bandwidth UNLESS you receive on one channel (5GHz) and repeat on anther (2.4GHz). This is on the last page of the little booklet. I've asked the seller multiple times for specific instructions on how to do this setup and each time, they've come back with \"it's magic\" - just follow the connection and it will magically happen. All the installation videos show the same signal being repeated - not the alternate channel. There is no clarity on whether the alternate channel needs to have the same SSID. I've asked for a step-by-step set of instructions over and over and I keep getting the same kind of responses. See below - this is the exact opposite of what is demonstrated in all the installation videos - the SSID of the signal connected is the signal relayed: \"According to the reply from the technical department.Plug in the repeater, and then expand the 5G SSID. Then a 5G and a 2.4G wifi will be expanded, and then you can connect them separately.This is the principle of operation, there is only one path.\"",

You plug it in, you connect to it, tap in your wifi data, and presto, extension. We have a problem with our service where it's very limited to one room. This turned it into a house-wide expansion. Easy as can be. I would recommend to anyone needed to extend their wifi service.",
