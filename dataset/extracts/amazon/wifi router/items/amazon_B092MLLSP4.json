                "reviewText": "I was using an old router with which I could get max download speed of 100Mbps with LAN connection and around 80-100Mbps with wireless connection. I was looking for something better since my ISP plan is 400Mbps down and 20Mbps upload.The setup with this router was pretty easy. Just connect the modem to this router as per the instructions and you are on your way. One thing I liked about this router is that I can combine both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz into a single band. That way I do not have to worry about remembering the names and passwords of 2 bands. I could get the speed of 400+Mbps with LAN connection and 200+Mbps with WIFI connection. The four antennas are enough to carry the signal around entire house.In short, I will recommend this product to everyone who is looking at the economical option without compromising the quality.",

I am thankful to my friend who recommended me this router. Installing this Speedefy router was so easy, I set this up through the app from my internet company, just by following the instruction.I have a setup of about 15-20 devices that includes phones, watches, voice assistant, smart lightings etc. Dual band on this device just serves all these devices perfectly. I never faced any coverage/signal strength issue so far.I would love to recommend this.",

Just in the last week the internet has dropped service everyday. I dont recommend to buy, get another brand",

So far I had to restart it and reset it twice on the first day the internet was installed and it was installed in the afternoon. I called tech support and no luck, the online help was no help at all. I'll keep it for now but if this keeps happening this coming week it will be returned for a refund.",

Not only is this one a fraction of cost compared to Verizon router, it's a lot faster as well. I have many devices connected to this router and most of the time several of them are accessing internet but this router seems to be handling it very well. Totally recommend.",

Email, moving large files, multiple Teams and Zoom conferences, and the occasional games all at the same time. Handles that traffic fine with no delays. Very easy to set up. Doesn't have as many detailed fine-tuning settings as some other routers, but it's got all the necessary/common ones and is working great.",
