                "reviewText": "I don't leave many reviews, but I was so impressed with this little extender that I had to write about it. I just moved into a townhouse across the street from my moms house. I don't want to pay for internet here if i can get a strong enough signal from her house across the street. Now Without the extender, I get a signal (2 bars) at the front of my house here, but the back side of my house doesn't get any signal, and some weaker devices cant get any internet connection at all, no matter where they are in the house. I plugged this extender in today at the front of my house (accross the street from the router at my moms) and set it up per the instructions, and immediately, I have 5 bars on the other side of my house! My signal strength is now max where it was 1 bar and no internet. I couldn't be happier! This little wi-fi extender just saved me $50-$100 a month on internet service. The directions could be a little better but they did walk me straight through the set up. I would say the pictures in the directions were more helpful than the instructions themselves. All in all, I am extremely satisfied with this wi-fi extender! I hope it continues working for many years. If it dies on me before that, i will post again, and you will see an update to this review.",

                "reviewText": "The Wi-Fi extender was very easy to setup. All I had to do was plug it in to the wall and connect to it via my phone. I then typed in the address provided on the back of the Wi-Fi extender. The Wi-Fi extender has a step-by-step wizard built in and it will guide you through the process of setting it up. It only took me two minutes to have everything up and going to use the Wi-Fi extender. The Wi-Fi extender works well to extend my Wi-Fi out in the garage so I can still stream music to my stand-alone garage. I highly recommend this Wi-Fi extender to anyone looking to extend their Wi-Fi to longer distances.",

                "reviewText": "If you want to upgrade wifi in your apartment, and the router you want to upgrade is almost in a straight line, then this is a perfect product. Although it will not create miracles, it is good at what it should do. With a little patience, it can do what you need to do. I recommend connecting the Ethernet cable to a router or an external device (I connect my LG TV) to get a clearer signal. The performance of the product is amazing. Wifi signal is very strong around the house, especially far away from the extender. When the router is far away, it will have a great impact. This product works. I recommend it",
