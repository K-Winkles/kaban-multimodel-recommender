I bought this new router and thankfully it was easy to install getting me online fast. Never heard of this brand before but the price was lower than most and the reviews sounded good. It's been a few days and so far it's working great. If I can install it and get online ANYONE CAN! 82 AND COUNTING. No cd was used.",

My suspicions seem to be right as I used powerline adapters to add this router to the room. The addition of routers to the network in the different rooms improved the wireless streaming. With the movement of the AI devices to this router. The response of the AI devices has improved as the streaming signal for some streaming players has been moved to Ethernet. This router has been performing very good for the two day that is has been in use. Reducing the wireless load on the primary modem has proven to be the right choice.

                "reviewText": "To start I would like to say that I almost returned this product before I even opened the box. The box was covered in Chinese lettering and not a word of english was on the package. I thought that maybe I was sent the incorrect unit. I ended up taking a gamble though and opened it up. Yes, the directions were also in Chinese. At this point I was laughing as I was making sure the serial numbers were the product I ordered and not something else. Sure enough it was the correct product. So how does it hold up? Let's find out!I'm pretty tech savvy, so even though everything was in Chinese it was pretty self explanatory. Set up was easy. Plug in ethernet from modem and power adapter and boom! I was off to the races. Luckily I knew this router had an app to control it on my phone, so set up was even easier since that was in english. The process was simple after making an account. It walks you through step by step on setting both your 5g and 2.4g network. I think it took me less than 5 minutes to do so.I currently have 9 devices set up on it. From computers to smart TVs to xboxes they are all on. This router is no slouch. It will run all 9 devices at the same time without a hitch. (I should mention that my internet is 400 down and 100 up). Signal strength is great. I currently live in a 1400 sq. ft. home and I have full bars in every room I stand in from upstairs to basement. I get some signal loss when I step outside, but I was also expecting that to happen. Either way, two thumbs up here.The ease of use of the app is really nice. My wife is not tech savvy at all. I showed her the app and the simple controls to regulate the kids internet and she was loving it. So even if you're not that great with computers or routers this unit makes it easy. Want to restrict the amount of data a particular device uses? Simple setting for that. Want to shut off service altogether to a particular device? It's easy with the push of a button. This is by far the easiest router I have ever used.So this gets a recommendation right? Easy buy? Well that depends. Are you wanting to hook up multiple devices to this using ethernet cables and not use wireless? You may be disappointed here then. You get two ports... That's it. Most give you 4. Then again for 36 bucks what do you expect. Just keep this in mind as make your purchase. I didn't need them, so I wasn't worried about it.To conclude I really like what I have here. So far it's great. I will come back after 6 months and give an update, but I think that this is going to work really well. Just be warned!!!! The box may not be what you're expecting...",

                "reviewText": "I won't even lie. This router worked great for me - strong signal, fairly insane speeds; I was getting 75mbps down (5GHz channel) and I'm pretty sure I only have a 30mbps Comcast plan. Good admin interface, everything checks out, and the price sure was right.But some vulnerability/backdoor (specifically something IPV6-related, as I noticed lots of strange traffic through that, and I normally never used ipv6 previously) got my ENTIRE house full of computers infected with a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) related malware, where the attacker remotely modified my Windows installation to be set up as an Active Directory client, as if my PC thought it was on a corporate network, beholden to the IT administration's control. So my group policies almost all set themselves to \"Managed\", and I couldn't change them myself. It also spread itself to any new USB media I made with windows' official Media Creation Tool, I believe through auto-generated malicious autorun.inf's under invalid pathnames, like D:\\System Volume Information\\:\\:autorun.inf (windows doesn't allow colons in pathnames), among many other weird and not-easily-detectable signs of tampering in my machine. Before I even noticed something was amiss, it had taken control of all the other PCs in the house including my girlfriend's. Even after a full drive wipe on any given computer, the malicious presence remained in the background.Just google \"Tenda vulnerability\", specifically Loki Labs' article \"Tenda, is this a bad design or a backdoor?\" to see what I'm talking about. Also read up on WMI malware, such as the recent Astaroth malware which I think might've been part of the type of virus I acquired, and how notorious and ancient it is as a method to compromise computers remotely. If you buy+use this router for a few days it's likely you'll even pick up a remote attacker on your network and not be able to notice it, except for some innocent-looking COM Surrogate Provider, rundll.32, Font Caching etc. (the list goes on and on) processes that blend in entirely with the operating system, because they are built-in to it. You'd be surprised just how insidious this type of infection can be, especially if you try to remove it without locking down your home network security impeccably before starting the reinstalls and everything.I've been tinkering with computers since I was almost a baby; develop software for a living and I've never seen anything quite like this until now. I'm still trying to get rid of it completely, after 2+ weeks of late nights and headaches, thinking I might've vanquished it this time only to find another subtle but unmistakable sign of infection. I've obviously ripped this router out and am preparing to return it, using my old wireless-N router for the moment, but even still this stupid attack seems to persist on all my computers, even on Ubuntu/linux (!!!), as I believe it got access to some of my laptops' UEFI firmware somewhere along the way... it's terrible, trust me, just don't mess with the Chinese brands if you value your time and privacy. I never cared either until this incident but you can bet your butt I have learned my lesson, firmly.",
