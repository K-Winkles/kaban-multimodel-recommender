The web site on the other hand needs to be worked on. I never could get it to take me where I needed to go. Only by accident did I get the device installed. I have built my own web site and I know how one is suppose to work. If it takes more than 3 clicks to get where you need to be, it is too difficult for the average user. Fix the web site and it will be a great product.",

                "reviewText": "First the bad news, I cannot use port forwarding, even though the feature is in the admin page. I've tried resetting the router, and also double-checked the settings. It's turned on, the port forwarding just refuses to work. If you're gonna run a server or are a gamer then you may want to look for a different router unless you use this in LAN bridge mode with another router that supports port forwarding (as an extender).ANother downside, the ethernet ports for internal use on the back only provided me 10 or so MB/s, they're low quality. However the port for actual Internet hookup works well. I've gotten 300 KB/s tops for speed on 5 G wifi.A good thing is this router can also act as a wireless repeater/extender, and it works well when doing so, even if I only get 65 Mbps on average while using the extended signal, it covers the backyard and areas of my house while my main router at the front does not.Over all I'm giving this 4 stars, because if you're just a non-tech savvy person and need a good wifi network this is for you.",

It is simple to set up but as I always say, DO NOT INSTALL THE DISKS THAT COME WITH PRODUCTS. that is how you get problems. Just log in and use the web interface on the router to set it up.

This modem ticked all the boxes, including ease of installation, signal strength, and a reasonable price tag. After initial set up, I did though encounter a single anomaly where I was unable to connect to it, probably conflict of IP address issue with Internet provider router, but eventually with a quick troubleshooting using the manual by restarting the modem, everything returned to normal. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a reasonably priced router to boost your internt across your residence",
