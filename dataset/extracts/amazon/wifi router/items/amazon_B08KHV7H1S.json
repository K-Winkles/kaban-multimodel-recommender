                "reviewText": "After reading many negative reviews I decided to try this anyway, because some people that write bad reviews just have other problems unrelated to the product.It worked immediately after plugging it in to Windows 10, but only connected at 2.4GHz at first. I use the same SSID for both bands, so the device can choose which band to use. I did see nearby 5GHz access points, so 5GHz was functional. I checked the advanced properties and didn't see a way to force 2.4/5 GHz operation. At this point I took the CD that came with it and tossed it aside and then download the latest driver on https://www.tp-link.com/us/. There are two Win 10 drivers listed with the newest driver nearest the top of the list. The driver installed with no problems and the adapter connected to 5Ghz just fine after updating.My only real complaint is that the adapter base is not weighted enough. The USB cord is very nice, heavy gauge wire and unless you tweak it just right the adapter will tip in whatever direction the cord pulls it. I'm tempted to glue a magnet to the bottom or try to add weight somehow but I don't want to interfere with the WiFi signals. Some of that blue adhesive putty you use to hang posters or secure knickknacks to your shelves would work to keep it secure too.The speed was many many times better than it was with my previous adapter which was a tplink n300, I went from about 20mbps to 330mbps. It claims to support 867mbps on 5GHz, but that is probably only under ideal conditions and very short range. The number of nearby networks also increased which tells me the range is much better than it was with the little dongle type adapter.Overall, for the price, this is a great adapter. I would buy it again.Oh and it doesn't claim to support Linux, although that doesn't always mean a product won't work on Linux either now or in the future. I didn't have a chance to test it with Linux yet so I can't say for sure.",

                "reviewText": "Decent WiFi adapter. Am using on both Windows 10 and 11 computers. No need to download the additional the drivers from TP-links website. Works well with the already pre-installed drivers Windows already has. Just a note, if your computer already has a built in network adapter be sure to disable it before using this one. Depending on your computers already installed network adapter you may or may not notice much difference. I found it to be more sensitive than the built in network adapter on my laptop. And I did notice even in strong wi-fi signal areas the internet speed on this adapter was slightly faster than the built in adapter on my notebook. I also noticed that this wi-fi adapter does not work ( or at least work well) when connected to USB extension cables, but it does work well when connected directly to the computers USB port with the already supplied cable. It would be nice if they offered an optional longer cable for the adapter. Oddly enough, even though for me it did not work with USB extension cables, it did work with the USB A to USB C adapter cable.",

                "reviewText": "my only complain is that it overheats if you put it on 5G so I would recommend putting it on top of your computer case where the case fan exhausts air too cool it off, but don't block the fan completely, only a small portion of it. Too bad it isn't magnetic, but I bought it on sale for around $20 so I'm not complaining, I wouldn't pay more than $25 for this, would rather upgrade to something that gives me 1600 mbps for $35+ or something, I'm either a value guy or go big go home guy and this network adapter for $20 (on sale) is really good value.",

So after several days of tinkering around with it to no avail, (changing USB ports, updating drivers, etc) I ordered a different antenna.Sure enough, the day that the new antenna arrived, this one started working again! So I'll stick with this antenna for now, it is quite fast after all. I just hope it doesn't have any more issues.",
