                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the TP-Link Archer A7 wifi router from Amazon.com in \"used: like new\" condition, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed with this device. Despite being used, the router looks and performs like it's brand new, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.Setting up the router was a breeze, and it only took a few minutes to get it up and running. The range of the wifi signal is excellent, and I have no trouble connecting to the internet from any corner of my home. The speed of the connection is also very impressive.One of the things I appreciate about this router is the user-friendly interface of the management app. It's easy to customize the settings and prioritize bandwidth for specific devices or applications. Plus, the guest network feature is a nice touch, as it allows me to give my guests access to the internet without compromising the security of my network.It also supports 220v, which makes it an ideal choice for use in countries with higher voltage standards. So, if you're looking for a router that can handle your internet needs and works with your voltage requirements, the TP-Link Archer A7 is definitely worth considering.Overall, I would highly recommend the TP-Link Archer A7 wifi router to anyone in the market for a reliable and high-performance router. It's a great value for the price, and it works flawlessly right out of the box.",

                "reviewText": "I like this product, to the point I purchased 4 of them.Pros: Easy to setup. Don't have to be a techie to do it. Easy to manage via web or mobile app. Quick to start up or reboot. Distance for signal is impressive. With little interference, range at 5G is easily 200ft and close to 300 on the 2.4 connection.Cons: Was hoping the mesh feature would work between units, it does not. It needs some parent mesh unit to get it working properly. Directions and help files were not much help with this. Unit has the ability to match up the device name to it's MAC.... does not share this between units or between mobile and webpage apps. Doesn't always save these. This is minor, but in an area where people try to hack and piggyback, it's nice to know what's attached. USB feature is a bit of a bust. Was surprised it's based of off very old tech. Not convenient to store and share media like a NAS would. Trying to connect the printer to it (USB) like a print server was a lie. Has issues with aluminum studs (common in modular homes).Overall: Excellent and easy to use device for pro's or newbies. I highly recommend setting up a free account and getting the app so the units can be managed away from home.I currently have 3 units setup. Since the mesh was a bust, I set one as a router and connected it to my modem. Set my own IP range and DHCP range. Connected the other 2 units as relays via the 1G ports. I can now cover almost all of my 2 acre property with little issue. It's not as smooth as mesh transferring from 1 wireless unit connection to the next, but it's almost seamless.",

However, it is an American model with a USA power supply (it came from Florida) but that is no problem with a UK adapter. The router is also an Archer A7 which apparently is identical to the Archer C7 according to the OpenWRT site. Seems to be working fine.",

En la banda de 5 Ghz, ya es otra cosa, se obtienen 200 Mb de descarga en dos de los cuartos, lo cual es excelente. Los puertos son Giga-bit y permite conexiones de hasta 1000 Mb, en los cuales conecto el AppleTV y el PlayStation.Lo innovador y que me gust\u00f3 mucho de este router son dos cosas:- Maneja una sola se\u00f1al de 2.4 Ghz y 5 Ghz, Conexion Smart, que permite a tu dispositivo conmutar autom\u00e1ticamente la conexi\u00f3n a la banda de WiFi que proporciona mayor velocidad. Es decir, salvo que deshabilites esta funci\u00f3n, no veras dos se\u00f1ales (2.4 Ghz y 5 Ghz) de manera independiente y el dispositivo se mantiene conectado a una sola se\u00f1al y conmuta entre ambas bandas. Con otros routers, normalmente te conectas/seleccionas la de 5Ghz, por ser la m\u00e1s r\u00e1pida, pero tan pronto se debilita la se\u00f1al salta a la de 2.4 Ghz y all\u00ed se queda, por ser una se\u00f1al m\u00e1s fuerte (pero m\u00e1s lenta).- El Archer A7, con hardware V5, viene habilitado para la funci\u00f3n OneMesh, que te permite agregar, dentro de una misma red (nombre y password), repetidores (compatibles) para armar una red inal\u00e1mbrica en tu casa (mesh), cosa que otros proveedores ofrecen a precios exorbitantes.No tiene tecnolog\u00eda Mu-Mimo para conexiones m\u00faltiples simultaneas a mayor velocidad, pero creo que sigue valiendo mucho la pena este equipo.",
