With the mobile app, it took a while for both the router and the satellite to be detected and installed.The mesh network worked fine for a couple days. While it was working, the signal was strong and the speed was good. However, after a couple days, my Samsung TV (bought in 2020) started to drop connection sporadically. Tried manually switching channels but to no avail. Also tried using the router only without the satellite, but the TV still couldn't get stable connectivity. To me this is a deal breaker.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this mesh system to improve coverage at my home which has a detached garage. My previous wireless was able to reach but would become less reliable during the summer months. The Netgear Mesh system does a fantastic job at resolving coverage issues as signals throughout the home are all good/great now. All devices are able to connect without issue, and overall, connectivity has been good.My main issue with this system is consistency. While I get great coverage for web surfing/media consumption, I cannot say the same for gaming. When gaming I will experience periods of lag which can make competitive play unbearably frustrating. This is while being directly wired to the satellite mesh which is working without issue when doing anything but gaming. From what I have read, this may be an issue with QOS settings, but as of yet, I have found no workable solution. Furthermore, a common problem with mesh systems is which device a wireless user connects to. My wife's computer is about 12 feet from the main hub, and yet here wireless signal becomes unstable at times as if it was connecting to the one located in the garage. I am unsure what can be done to address this as I hear this is somewhat common with mesh systems.Hopefully, with some tweaks/firmware updates, these issues can be resolved. I may decouple the networks (making 2.4 and 5gHz bands separate) to see if that helps at all.",
