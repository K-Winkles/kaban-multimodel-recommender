Plus, the USB 2.0 port is perfect for smaller file transfers or a dedicated printer. Beamforming focuses the Wi Fi signal directly to your smartphones, tablets and laptops instead of sending out a general transmission for a more efficient network with a wider range. Smart Wi Fi lets you access your network anytime, anywhere. Using your browser or the Smart Wi Fi mobile app, you can prioritize devices or websites, control content, monitor network activity and more. Advanced WPA2 encryption and SPI firewall help keep your network and personal information safe and secure.",

Beamforming enables the router to identify and connect directly with other devices rather than simply sending out wireless signals in a general direction. This results in faster network speeds, better wireless range, and reduced interference from other devices. It also helps extend the battery life of connected devices and reduce their power consumption because data is transferred more quickly. USB 3.0 and Gigabit Ports Deliver Fast Transfer Speeds The AC1900 includes USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports, letting you easily share devices like external hard drives and printers across your network. It also has four gigabit ports to connect wired devices at speeds up to 10x faster than Ethernet. Upgrade Your Devices to Enjoy the Full Benefits of Wireless-AC Using Linksys's family of wireless-AC peripherals you can take full advantage of the improved speed and stability of wireless-AC. The Linksys Universal Media Connector (WUMC710) lets you connect wired devices such as game consoles and smart TVs to your Wi-Fi network and stream HD or even 3D HD video content seamlessly. The connector operates on the 5 GHz band, resulting in less interference and a clearer signal. Additionally, the Linksys Dual Band AC1200 Wireless 3.0 Adapter (WUSB6300) enables you to upgrade your laptop or desktop computer to fully benefit from the faster speeds of wireless-AC technology to stream high-definition video or enjoy high-speed gaming.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars SUCH a difference!",
                "reviewText": "The short:Pros:- MEGA fast (connecting, streaming, transferring)- USB ports (with 1 supporting faster USB 3.0)- Powerful signal (no longer in competition with apartment complex neighbors--consistently strongest signal)- Sleek interface (easy setup, easy maintenance and setting changes)- Very convenient (Phone app allows remote support, meaning you can manage your router from anywhere)- Lots of functionality (client management, parental controls, media prioritization, NAS management)- Competitively priced- Aesthetically pleasing, much softer lighting than typical routers (esp. Linksys)Cons:- Mounting holes are in an odd spot (hangs router such that cables protrude to the left)- Power cable is a little shortFor reference I am on Charter (cable broadband like Comcast or Time Warner) with advertised 60 Mb/s. I live in a 2-level apartment with lots of 2.4 GHz noise from surrounding networks. We have the following wireless devices: 2 laptops, 2 desktops, 2 smartphones, Chromecast, and a game console. I used to also use a wireless range extender (TP-Link N300), however now I don't need it!The long:What a great router! I upgraded from an old Cisco N300 router that had done the job fine, but was beginning to need periodic resets in order to be functional. This combined with a shotty modem provided by my cable internet company and a range extender on another floor made for a frustrating dissatisfactory internet experience about 50% of the time. I upgraded to a new modem (Archer SURFBoard), and noticed the connection on wired devices was faster and more consistent, however my wireless signal was still spotty and intermittent especially with the noisy surrounding networks. I decided it was time to upgrade.I am definitely a techie so I did a lot of research before on different routers, and heard rave reviews from a relative and a coworker on the management app, signal strength, and overall router performance. The setup was super simple, just plug and play if you just want a router that works! The quick-start guide lists the pre-set strong password and unique SSID. I, however, had to make sure I knew every setting and feature well, and was very impressed with the settings for Media Prioritization (very useful for streaming) and External Storage (NAS, FTP server and user permissions!). I also set the wireless channel to 9 after bringing up a WiFi analyzing app on my phone and seeing that 1-6 or so were jam packed.The difference was, well, underwhelming! Before I was consistently annoyed, and now I hardly even notice it's there! The external storage is super useful if you haven't used that before. Me and my wife can transfer files between computers much faster now--our own personal cloud! I no longer use a range extender and I never lose connection.Overall, very pleased. Job well done, Linksys.P.S. My SSIDs: TellMyWiFiLoveHer and BillWiTheScienceFi",

                "reviewText": "I rarely give 5 stars, but this router exceeded my expectations at a great price. I saw all of the negative reviews and comments about the performance of this unit; I still took a chance on it because of the $99 price. I did not want to spend $180 to $300 to get a dual band router with all the latest features.I have to say, this unit is perfect. No compromise. Set-up was a breeze. I even setup SSIDs that are hidden on both 5GHz and 2.4GHz bands. You can do MAC filtering easily and easily setup guest networks.The performance is blazing fast. I have ethernet in every room and pretty fast Cox Internet service. But I have a TV outside with a WiFi Bluray player; with my old router I could not get decent range and speeds outside on 2.4Ghz. With this I get blazing fast speeds outdoors and the router is upstairs in a large home with no extenders. I can easily stream 4k content outside. Indoors I setup all the cell phones in house to use 5ghz; blistering fast speeds. And the router runs rock steady, i have yet to reset it once. Really glad I took a chance. 50 - 90MB over WiFi throughout a large two story home is in my opinion pretty darn good!!",

                "reviewText": "I only had this router for a couple of days, but so far it works good. The setup was easy; I didn't time it, but I'd say it was about 10 minutes. I kept my network name and password the same to make the transition easier since I have numerous devices that use wifi. The one device I use is something called an ISY994i, which is used in home automation to control light switches around the house. I had to do a number of tweaks to get that working again. However, the one area where I have an issue is my iPhone 5. Every so often, it loses the connection. The only way to resolve this is is to go into the iPhone 5 settings and turn off wifi, then turn it on again. Once I do that, it works again. But I have to repeat that every time I have an issue. I even tried assigning my iPhone a high priority, but that has no effect. I was reading online that the iPhone does not have the wireless AC chip in it, since the wireless AC standard is still new. I don't know if that is the cause of the issue or not. Everything else seems to work fine. I also have an iPad 3 that only has wifi and that seemed to work fine. But I don't use the iPad 3 that often. I'm hoping the vendor or fellow reviewer perhaps may be able comment on the issue with my iPhone 5, and perhaps suggest a work around. Maybe there will be a future firmware update that will fix the issue. Hopefully when the iPhone 6 comes out, perhaps Apple will include the AC chip in it.",

                "reviewText": "Great product and great technical support. I had a very complicated set up in my home. I have 4 hardwired computers, 3 TVs, android phone, alarm system, thermostat, garage door monitor, internet on my fridge, 1 USB 3.0 external Hard Drive, 1 USB 2.0 external Hard Drive, 2 Kindles and a commercial Konica Minolta copier. Because the copier is set up to connect to specific IP addresses that were created by my old Linksys router, I needed to retain those IP addresses so I did not have to reconfigure the Konica Minolta copier. for the scan/fax function. I thought that it would be a nightmare to set up the new network. With the extremely excellent support by Linksys, I had it all set up in 2 hours and no nightmare. They even helped me reconfigure my old Linksys AC6500 to act as a wi-fi signal booster.I had originally purchased a router from TP Link. When I called their customer support over 45 times (daytime calls) and got a busy signal, I thought that they were understaffed. When I finally did get through, the person on the other end said that they would help me. After 15 minutes into the conversation, I knew that the rep had no idea what he was doing so I hung up and returned the product. I do hope that companies will realize that the quality of customer service has the potential to make or break their company. If they want to stay in business in the long term, they need to wise upI am very impressed with the router and I strongly recommend this company.",
