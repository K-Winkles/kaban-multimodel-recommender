Made my life easier, so I wouldn't have to run cable out to the garage. The setup wasn't too bad. Just not use to using my phone to do it all. but it went very fast. Thank you. I will be recommending this to anyone looking for a wireless router ..",

                "reviewText": "I needed to find a decent router for my 72 year old mom. She lives by herself and views all of her TV through streaming apps. I found this router for a pretty good price and, since having used Netgear in the past, I figured it would be pretty good for what she needed.I set it up in early September and connected all of her devices. Everything seemed fine for a while, then I get a call this past weekend from my mom letting me know her WiFi is completely out. Since I was in the area, I stopped by to take a look. I figured it would be an easy fix. To my surprise, not only was there no WiFi, but the router name wasn't even showing up in the network list even though the power light was on. I've never seen that before. So I unplugged it and did a simple. After about 2 or 3 minutes, everything was good to go. I told her everything should be fine, and I left.The next day I get a message from her again. The WiFi is out! So, I drove by and found it was the same issue! The power light was on, but no WiFi and no router name in showing up in the list. It's like the thing just completely dies and broadcasts nothing at all. Again, I did a simple reset just to get her set for the day and told her I'd be back this week when I had more time to do a full factory reset - hoping that would solve the problem.I get a call from her today, and guess what? The WiFi is out yet again. Big surprise! This time she goes into detail of her evening with the router. So before I left the day before, I plugged the router into a power strip and told her just to flip the switch on and off if she loses internet again. Easy enough. So she did that, and the WiFi comes back on - for about 45 minutes. So she flips the switch again, the WiFi come back, then goes off again after 45 minutes or so. She does this a few times with the same result, so she gives up. So I made another drive over there to check things out - and yet again, the same issue. Power light on - No WiFi or router name in the list of available networks. This time I take the router home with me with every intention of sending it back, cause I'd had it!I contact Amazon who then proceed to tell me that my return window is closed after 30 days. 30 days! I said 30 days isn't enough to test and know for sure that an item like this is defective or not. I continue to hold my ground and convince them to give me an exception AND a full refund of my purchase price. Now I've got a return label and this thing is going back.I've got two routers here at my house, a Western Digital and an Asus. I plugged them in when I first got them and haven't touched them since. There is no reason why a router should be failing after only a month or so of use AND there is no reason why it should be dropping the internet every 45 minutes after reset. Definitely a piece of junk and I'm glad to be sending it back. If you're looking for a router, maybe look at another brand. I've never had as much trouble with a wireless router as I've had with this one, and I've been dealing with wireless routers for over 15 years.",
