(We were only getting about 20 before.) Only had the router up for a couple of days but it seems to be performing very well.",

When my last router died, I looked around and settled on this one. The price was higher than some other options, but lower than the most expensive routers.Of all the routers I've had, this one is the easiest to set up. There is a useful Nighhawk app you can use, but it's not requried.We sometimes stream on multiple devices, and the router has been working great, in terms of speed and distance to devices. It has four antennas on top.There are two physical buttons on the top of the router that are very useful. You can use one to instantly the router's Wi-Fi transmission on or off.The other button make is very easy to quickly add devices (it uses the Wi-Fi Protected Setup process, known as WPS).",

I have been a Tech Specialist for more than 50 years on computer stuff - I did not feel I was actually getting support to make the unit work. If you know specifically what you are doing with Net Gear products I am sure it is a good product.
