                "reviewText": "Perfect for my Orbi satellite. Screws mounting Orbi to stand have updated and screw tightly to the base plate and Orbi without needing washers. Reviewers indicated the Orbi anchor screws they received passed through the baseplate. That's fixed.Mounted this behind my smart TV for additional ethernet wiring for wired streaming devices, TiVo, and for vastly improved WiFi to my smart TV.I mounted the stand on the wall using picture mount anchors which are less damaging to my wall. I used a couple round felt pads on the portion of the plate which is against the wall to avoid damaging wall and to provide a more level surface for the Orbi. I wrapped the Orbi A/C cord around the handy winding posts and plugged the cord into the Orbi without problems. I then hand tightened the plate-to-Orbi anchor screws into the Orbi. the holes line up perfectly between the Orbi and the stand.I now have a secure out-of-sight mounting platform and improved WiFi from my satellite. Delighted with this mounting system. Highly recommended.",

Easily strong enough to support the satellites plus they come with the necessary mounting hardware. Being able to wind up the excess power cord helps keep a clean installation. Plenty of space around the Orbi also reduces heat (improving performance) and mounting higher on the wall improves wireless performance. These do cost a bit more but the features and quality of construction are excellent.",

Would give 5 stars, but as others have noted, the screws are too small for the hole in the bracket so they just pull right through. Nothing 10 cents in metal washers can't fix, and luckily I had some, but annoying if you don't.",

                "reviewText": "Los soportes son de aluminio de 2.5mm, en color natural que combina con el dise\u00f1o del enrutrador y los sat\u00e9lites. El kit incluye dos soportes, incluye tornillos y taquetes para fijarlos a la pared, y cuatro pares de tornillos (dos pasos de cuerda diferente - M4x10 y 32x3/8\" -) para fijar los equipos.Eleg\u00ed esta marca y modelo por: precio, color, y por que el dise\u00f1o del soporte tiene recortes para ventilar los equipos por la parte inferior.Tienen las dimensiones exactas, no se doblan o mueven con el peso ya montados El dise\u00f1o de los soportes mantiene los equipos separados de la pared, incluyen elementos con recortes del mismo aluminio para enredar los cables de alimentaci\u00f3n y/o ethernet y que no queden sueltos.El \u00fanico detalle son las perforaciones de los tornillos para sujetar los equipos, son del di\u00e1metro de la cabeza de los tornillos, para solucionar esto tuve que colocar rondanas peque\u00f1as.En general fueron una buena elecci\u00f3n, por lo que los recomiendo.",

Certainly strong enough to hold the RBR850, BUT, as seen in the picture, the provided screws head are way too small that it just went right through the hole. Although I received it, I cannot use it yet because I need to go to a hardware store to pick up two washers.... That's too bad.",
