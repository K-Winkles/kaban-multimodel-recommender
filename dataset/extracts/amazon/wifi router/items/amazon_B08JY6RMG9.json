                "reviewText": "My old router finally died so I needed to do some research to replace it. After a lot of searching around, I came up with this router, which seemed to be very capable for a relatively inexpensive price.The router came intact without any problems set up, was easy with the provided app. I set mine up as a second separate network from my Internet providers device. I connected it to the cable modem by pre-existing ethernet connection at the side of my old router, then follow the instructions on the app And I was up and running in less than five minutes.I have had no problems, connecting with any of my devices, which include security, cameras, thermostats, laptops, TVs and iPads. My son works from home for a software company has been running his work operation without any difficulties, and we have not experienced any limitations with regard to bandwidth or speed. The range of the router is quite good without any dead spots within my 5000 square-foot home and garage. We even have good signal outside around the pool.I will summarize by saying this is a great router, for the money does what it says, and it\u2019s easy to set up",
