The instructions were easy to follow, but if you have ever set something like this up before, it's very similar. Once I got the cable ran and the repeater mounter, setup went pretty quick. After getting everything setup, I took a stroll around the property and I am getting a very strong signal all the way at the edges of the property where I was getting nothing before.
