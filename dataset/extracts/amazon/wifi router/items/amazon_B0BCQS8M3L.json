And it has privacy and security features to help keep you and your family safe. LEGAL [1]Up to 2x faster as compared to a Wi-Fi 6 router that supports 80 MHz channels. Wi-Fi 6E specifications are based on use of a Wi-Fi 6 or later generation client device that supports 160 MHz channels. Actual speeds depend on your internet service provider, network conditions, connected device, local regulations and environmental factors. [2]Router placement and home size, materials and layout can affect how Wi-Fi signal travels. Poor placement and larger homes or homes with thicker walls or long, narrow layouts may need extra Wifi routers for full coverage. Strength and speed of signal will also depend on your internet provider. More than 5 routers in a network may result in degraded performance and is not recommended. [3]A Wi-Fi 6E client device is needed to directly access the 6 GHz band, which is limited to indoor use only. [4]Actual speeds depend on your internet service provider, network conditions, connected device, local regulations and environmental factors. [5]Based on product weight.

                "reviewText": "The only reason why I am upgrading is because my IPS gave me deal for 1 GBs. I had 200 MBs and that was more than enough for me. I had Google Wifi (gen1) for about 5 years. No problems except I had to buy extra pod to strengthen the signal (i live in condo and i have brick walls). So the signal from my balcony room (storage with concrete walls) was poor to my office. I bought nest wifi and everything was working good (connection was great / good) between nest wifi (router gen2) to 2 google wifi (gen1). I notice that after I got 1 GBs from ISP my speed was still the same 100 MBs on wifi. When I disconnected gen 1s (routers) my speed next to router (testing on iphone 14pro) was 560 MBs. If I would probably just switch my old 2 google wifi (gen 1) to Nest Wifi (gen2) I would be just fine. But since I live in condo I was like let me try that new 6Ghz.So I bought Nest Wifi Pro 3pk. Signal between 3 of them is great. If I would just use 2 it would be \u201cGood signal\u201d. I live in 1500 sqft apt, but my main router is basically in concrete storage (maybe I will drill a whole and put that router inside apt and give update).Speed next to Nest Wifi pro (gen3) router seems to be the same as Nest Wifi (gen2) what I am trying to say is I wouldn\u2019t upgrade if all my previous pods were Nest Wifi (gen2). I wouldn\u2019t expect more than 600 MBs on this routers based on my research online. What I like about google is steady speed, and they are upgrading software for this Nest Wifi Pro (so in future it will get better)Wifi speeds:Shed 500-600 MBs download / 22 MBs upload wifi speedWorkout Room about 300 MBsOffice 150-300 MBsOverall I don\u2019t play a lot of games. Tried for CS 2 and ping was good, no lags in game.Streaming videos for 6hrs no buffering problems.Overall:If are upgrading from Google Wifi yea thats upgrade. I would not suggest upgrading Nest Wifi (only if you experience network problems or want to see if wifi will be stronger but I don\u2019t see this wifi hitting more than 600 Mbs). Who needs more than 1 GBs internet.Design:I don\u2019t really care about it but looks like nice stone (gen3). If its goes about power connector I am not a fan of it. Gen 1 had better in my opinion because if you connect to multiple plug connector it easy.Missing:Nest WiFi pro use 1 GBs Ethernet/WAN speed (that wire entry) while competition use 2.5 GBs Ethernet/WAN speed. On the other hand who use Ethernet anymore? Gaming desktops and maybe playstation. But going forward I believe it will be all Wifi at some point.Signal:Seems to be better than Google WiFi (gen 1 and gen 2)Software:I had recently update on this which means google is working on this router. Maybe It will get better in future.Installation:Very easy on Google Home app. If you use the same wifi password and name, all your devices will connect automatically. However 3rd took me about 5 tries but finally was added.Price: Very Good compare to others. If you need 4pk see costco.Update from 14 January 2024:I found that moving modem and router from my storage/heating closet to open (without obstruction of concrete/brick walls) inside apartment made increased speed of 400-600 Mbps per second. The farther away pod goes 400+ Mbps. (On 1gb internet for comcast)I don\u2019t see any issues with this system. I changed my 4 starts to 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this when it first became available. Just received this afternoon 11/4. Tried setting up but both access points would not connect. Spent 1 hour on the phone with support and they finally said to me \u2018they\u2019ll kick this up to a senior engineer but, if I can I should return it to Amazon as it appears defective\u2019. So I\u2019m returning it after spending 2+ hours trying to setup and on the phone with support. Just to give background I am very familiar with google products as I have the original google wifi. Worked flawlessly till they passed a firmware upgrade on this past summer. Since then have had to restart all the routers once a week. The next one I order better work. Will update once I get and successfully setup.Update 11/26 - got the system to work by hooking each wifi point up to the router with internet first. That allowed each wifi point to load whatever updated software it needed as well as connect to the system. I was then able to disconnect each point from the routers internet via Ethernet cord move it to where I wanted it and then it reconnected to the main router. The system now works perfectly and is super fast! Love it!!! But, can\u2019t say the same for google support. They should know how to make the system work and be able to troubleshoot it if someone calls, like me, and the fact that they weren\u2019t able to is not goog sneed for me or anyone in the future if something happens. Now that this works I can recommend it and say it\u2019s fairly simple to setup. Just connect each point to the router when initially setting up so they can each get setup. Hope this helps everyone!",

                "reviewText": "The set up process is by far the most finicky (I have spent several hours setting this up \u2013 Orbi took me 5 minutes in the past)The configuration software is by far the worst \u2013 Every thing visible seems good and then it fails on the last step like over 30 times with different error messages (WIFI point out of range or something went wrong etc)The operating software is by far the most fragile and least adaptable (if you are able to set it up)The nodes want to talk to each other through an unknown band meaning they fail to talk to each other over WIFI or wired backhaul that is at full strength and then fail due to an inability to talk over some other band that doesnt seem to be workingIt seems to have been tested in a small apartment setting and doesn\u2019t seem suitable to larger free standing houses with mixed materials and multiple floors - the routers fail to talk to each other over a thin wall that has WIFI blasting through at 5 barsThe QR code is Black on a dark grey backround (hard for the camera to read)The text is indentation on a dark grey background (grey on grey) - VERY hard to read once the bad QR code reader fails (maye Google should have gone with OpenCV or Lens instead of whatever QR code recognizer is failing for them). Make sure you have any reading aid you have on handIt seems like extra effort was spent to make things worse that they can be even when compared to bad software written often by other hardware companiesThe software is set up to be fragile so you keep going to your smart phone (maybe so they can be ads on the app in the future - doesn't seem designed for set up once and forget it like others)I must congratulate this team by exceeding the possibilities of software fragility and set up painIF it was not for sunk cost fallacy I would already have another brand by now - I am going to give it another day or so and if not off to Costco for OrbiIMO this does feel like one of the manufacturer's side Gig where they didnt take the effort to make the UX seamless even if the hardware is potentially top notch. This also gets me worried about future support even if I figure our how to set this upUPDATE - Went to Costco and was looking around. Had a bunch of people come and tell me how bad their experience with Google WIFI was - both this and the past generation sold at Costco - Got TP Link up and running in 5 minutes. Setting up Satellites is automatic - ANY router can be Primary if one of them has issues. Wired backhaul works perfectly. Set up was a breeze... Google needs to up its software game. The changes needs seems VERY simple - why Google refuses to do better on its software for WIFI devices is interesting to me",
