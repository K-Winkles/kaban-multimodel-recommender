                "reviewText": "I found the shelf itself to be attractive, easy to assemble, and sturdy enough. It's only made of styrofoam board, but the boards themselves are thick and don't need to support much weight. It fits all my equipment well, although it is tight.The biggest flaw here is that you're just not going to be able to wall-mount it using the included brackets. They result in screws that are far too close to the interior corners of the unit, making it impossible to fit a screwdriver in to push them against a wall. If you don't mind a bit of DIY at your local hardware store, this could be a good fit. But if you only follow the instructions, you're likely in for a rough time",

                "reviewText": "It was made of some sort of foam board or plastic but looks pretty good and certainly hides the cable box up high in a doorway. My husband dropped it and was able to glue it back together and I think it looks like a doorbell cover or small electronic device cover, which it is. A great improvement on the naked cable box and cheaper than hiring someone to make a tiny cabinet.",
