Go to your phone's WiFi connection page and select \"Repeater-XXX\" to connect. (If you can't find the name of the repeater WIFI, it is recommended to turn on Airplane Mode on your phone and then turn off Airplane Mode.) \uff1b 3. Connect to \"Repeater-XXX\" and then jump directly to the browser page to set the WIFI information of the repeater, note that the repeater password set inside needs to be the same as the router's WIFI password!!! If you can't jump automatically, enter 192.168.11.1 in this browser; 4. If it still doesn't work, there is another way, you can plug in the Internet cable through the computer and enter the IP address (192.168.11.1) on the computer browser to configure.",

A: 1.Make sure your computer is connected to the extended networl 2.Make sure your conputer is set to obtain an IP address automatically 3.If the Repeater has connected to the router ,you should go to your router's DHCP client list to obtain the Repeater's current IP address Reset the Repeater Q:Why does the wireless transmission rate speed down,when the wireless signal is stronger after repeated by the Repeater? A: In compliance with the wireless transmission protocol,all the repeater devices are set to work in half-duplex instead of full-duplex mode. In other words,the repeater has to process one-way communication between your root wireless router(or AP) and the terminal clients,so the transmission time will be double-increased ,while the speed will be decreased.Recommends that you reset the extender when your home network connection is poor,or when you want a larger wireless coverage to eliminate\"dead zones\" Q:Why the devices connected to the Repeater cannot get an IP address from the Repeater and cannot access the Internet A: 1.Maybe your enabled a wireless MAC filter,wireless access control,or access control list(ACL) on your router. To solve this problem,please log into your router.To solve this problem,please log into your and disable the mac filter, wireless access acontrol or ACL 2.Maybe the Repeater has not been successfully connected to your router,please reset the Repeater and reconfiguration 3.Maybe the IP address of the router is occupied or the wireless device connected by the router has reached the limit.plsease reboot your router,then reset the Repeater and Reconfiguration",
