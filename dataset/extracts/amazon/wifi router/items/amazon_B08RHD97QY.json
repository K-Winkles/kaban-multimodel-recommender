                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars SOOO MUCH BETTER THEN THE NO NAME WIFI EXTENDER I BOUGHT FIRST.",
                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace a cheap, no-name WiFi extender that i bought based off decent reviews. Brand CUU 2022 newest WiFi extender booster repeater 4000 sqft- blah blah blah. It was $2 more than this, the size of a pack of cigarettes, single band (2.4G) and only rated for 300mbps. That was a mistake. The ONLY job the extender needed to do was boost the signal for a Firestick that\u2019s plugged into my old tv i brought into the garage i dispatch out of. I work for a utility company so we garage out of an old converted airplane hanger, and we sit around inside in the morning waiting for our work, and at the end of the day when we do or timesheets - so we wanted to be able to watch the news and whatever else during that downtime. The router is only about 70 feet away, but a hallway separates us, so the WiFi signal has to make it through 2 concrete walls. Without an extender the tv would constantly buffer, or just stall and lose signal, or the image quality was horrible. Basically we were unable to watch anything without it constantly having issues every few minutes. So not being a tech guy - i bought (what i thought) was a real cheap extender figuring anything would be good enough. The difference in build quality and performance (so far) between my first purchase and this model is huge - and this was $2 cheaper. First off its dual band, so does both 2.4G and 5G bands. The 1200mbps (from what i understand) is the combined signal capacity, but you wont actually get that since you have to pick one of the two network signals. It actually gives you two different WiFi networks you can connect to (maybe thats beneficial to someone, i have no idea). I know enough to know the 5G is better. I installed this via TP\u2019s tether app (i think thats what it was called), and even for someone like me, it was painless. The instructions are very clear, and self explanatory once you launch the app. All you need is your routers password, and obviously the name of its WiFi signal. After install and connection, youll get two more WiFi signals to pick from to connect onto. One will say EXT on the end, and the other will say EXT 5G or something similar. I picked the 5G to connect my phone and Firestick to. Hooking up the Firestick to it was just as easy. Whats cool with the app, is you can even control and monitor WHO and WHAT are connected on the extenders network. It\u2019ll show you how many devices are connected to each band (they show up as 2 different WiFi signals), what type of devices are connected, and will even let you block unwanted devices if they connect to your extenders WiFi signal. If nothing else itll be fun to mess with the other 20 guys i work with - if they figure out how to connect to it lol. I can literally sit there with my phone and turn their connection on and off it looks like. But yea, what you get with this (a name brand unit from what I\u2019m told) is leaps and bounds above what i just returned, and was basically the same price. I just hooked it up today, so its still early - but so far the Firestick is working fine on a 4K tv. Picture quality is great, nothing is too slow to load, and most important the Firestick hasnt been buffering or had the signal stall out at all. And remember - its extending a signal thats behind 2 cinder block walls with metal doors - so probably a bit more than youll have to deal with in a house. If it starts giving me any issues - i will report back. So far I\u2019m much happier with this then the last purchase. So happy i didnt give up and just keep what i first bought. Its hard these days will all the fake reviews for products - and I promise you this is a completely honest and no BS review. Not that i tried them all, but they give you 3 different options on how to connect this to your router. I suggest scanning the QR code in the instructions, downloading the app and installing it that way. If nothing else it\u2019s pretty cool to actually be able to SEE who and what is connected to your new signal.Edit: Ok so its been about a month now. My opinion of this product has not changed. The Firestick/tv has experienced from VERY minor buffering very infrequently, mostly in the morning when everyone is in the building (probably peak traffic for our router) so for me to claim it \u201cnever\u201d buffers wouldn\u2019t be accurate. Its most definitely not something that I would even attempt or consider addressing given my particular situation and conditions. Our router is running half of our construction garage with close to a dozen desktops in different rooms just on our side of the building. Every tech has company tablets, so thats at least 20 guys just in my group alone that are splitting their signals between cell service and WiFi when they are close enough to jump on it. Just making the point our router is already handling way more stuff then anyone would experience at home, so some VERY and infrequent hiccup on the Tv is easily forgiven in my eyes under these circumstances. The day after thanksgiving we only had about 5 guys in, and were held back in the garage all day just to respond to any emergency call that might come in. I streamed the News, then John Wick 1 and 2 off Tubi with the Firestick and it was rock solid the entire time. I wouldn\u2019t not hesitate for a second if i needed one of these for home.",

                "reviewText": "I own a 4500 sq ft two story home. We use one of the bedrooms upstairs as our office and our modem and router are located there. Our family room is located downstairs and the wifi signal is weakest in this area. We have lived with it for several years and used a satellite TV service. We decided to eliminate the TV service and go to streaming. Thats when we discovered the weak wifi signal as an issue. We bought this TP Link wifi extender. It arrived the next day and I installed it. Bam!, no more issues with a weak signal and the TV works perfectly. The extender was easy to setup. They give you three different methods to set it up but I used the WAN button on the router method. We have 2.4 and 5.0 channels and the extender picked up on both. You press the wan button on the router, then press the wan button on the extender. Wait for it to connect (takes a minute or two) and it connects to the 2.4. Then repeat the process and it connects to the 5.0. Unplug it and move to an outlet in the weak area. If the signal getting to the extender is not strong enough, the light will be red instead of white. If this happens then move the extender to an outlet a little closer to the router. It couldn't have been easier. Very happy with this wifi extender.",

                "reviewText": "This range extender is good for the price, when on sale. However the description is deceptive.If you think you will get a mesh network with 1200 mbps throughput on the 5GHz band, which is what the description implies, you will be disappointed. What you do get is ONE of the following:1. An easy and inexpensive way to create a mesh network, ONLY on the 2.4GHz band, IF you already own a TPLink router with EasyMesh. In this mode it uses the 5GHz band for backhaul to the main router. True max data speeds will be around 50mbps.2. A non-mesh range extender on both 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. Max data speed on 5GHz will be around 500 mbps. The stated 1200 mbps max is not even theoretically possible since, like any range extender, half the bandwidth is used for backhaul to the main router. It would be nice if it could function in this mode while using EasyMesh but, at least with my Archer A7 router, this configuration is not possible.3. A wireless access point that transmits on both 2.4 and 5GHz bands when connected by hardwire to your router. However max speed is limited to 100 mbps because it's only a 100 mbps hardwire connection, not the 1GHz that is typical today.Within the limitations above it functions well. I use it in the no. 2 mode. It produces a strong signal with 400 to 500 mbps throughput, even with the main router going through 3 walls to reach it, and two of them are bathroom walls with ceramic tile, backed with metal lath and cement. This is usually a problem, especially for 5GHz.",
