She works from home and we have built her a shed that we turned into her office. The wifi was so intermittent and weak, she hasn't been able to work from it. We also have been looking for something to boost the wifi so we can enjoy wifi in the garden. We set up cameras due to animals breaking in and eating our plants. Our garden is behind out steel garage and wifi was not making it to where the camera was located. We did some digging and decided to give this product a try after trying so many other options. To our surprise, this worked! And it worked great!! Better than expected. The wifi now reaches the outdoor shed office and my wifi can enjoy her brand new spacious office whole working. It also boosted the wifi so the signal reaches behind / through our steel garage and we can now few our garden camera with no issues. Bonus that we can also stream music and or stream on our TV that's on the garden patio when we have guests or are just enjoying a nice evening. This has made an amazing addition and made us be able to enjoy our back yard to its fullest with parties. It's made my wife so happy to be able to work from her office. Happy wife means happy life! So easy to set up and when I messaged the seller with questions prior to purchasing, they were very helpful. Highly recommend this extender and we have tried so many others with no luck.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is a great little wifi extender, not bulky at all. It lays pretty flush to what ever outlet you plug it into. I will say that the way it is designed makes it so it needs its own plug outlet, you won't be able to plug anything into the second port on your wall, not a big deal for me as I picked a spot to place it where I don't use that outlet for anything anyway.Set up was fast and easy. You just scan a QR code and the steps are pulled up in your phone. You will use your phone to create and connect to the extended network, and then all of your other devices can be added after that. It conveniently has you use the same password as your current wifi router. The extender will default to the same name as your original router, but with 'EXT' label at the end of the name so its easier to tell where you're connected.It's best to plug it in within 20 feet of the original router for best results, and as directly between the router and the dead zone you wish to fix, as possible.I was very pleased with the speed at which my devices were able to run on the network. Dow loads were very quick, web pages loaded right up, and streaming videos produced no lag or buffer time. Before this, I had a TV in my room at the back of the house that took ages to load any streaming service, and then my shows would need to buffer often in the middle of watching. I no longer have this issue! And my home office at the back of the house is now fully functioning, where before, I could hardly do a zoom meeting.Specs:-300Mbps-2.42 - 2.47 GHz-Low power consumption, low radiation, energy saving.-Works through walls",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was able to set this up within seconds of getting it by holding down the WPS button you will be able to connect to the SSID and scan for your home WiFi and connect to it. I also do like the security setting feature where it automatically creates a 192.168.10.0/24 subnet for itself but still NAT's to other servers unfortunately. It would be great to see it manually blocking ranges except for the loopback address and gateway. The gateway/SSID that the device 'piggy backs' on has the modem and AP accessible when connected to the device. Fortunately I can block all connections from those ranges and make it into a guest network.The range is pretty decent along with the Mbps that is is able to transfer is okay. With range comes degraded quality which is too be expected for a device like this. Security on the device is shotty; No way to set a device password and just allows anyone on the network to access the pages and modifying settings on the device itself. Some basic access control settings / options would have been great for a more secure web application. There are probably options out there to upgrade to a custom firmware or to just compile your own and flashing it to the device. I do also like how there is an ethernet port which allows for an inline connection (albiet still a wireless device repeating a signal that will already be slightly slower than originally)For what I am using it for security is a non-issue for this device because I can block all access to where I need too as it is behind a firewall I have setup with proper inbound and outbound rulesets. I also have an IPS that runs to stop all incoming connections except for the US (as I am not running my server globally, just within the US). Security should always be a number one priority, even in this instance. I will be taking it upon myself to try and gain kernal level access so that there could be some modifications and updated security aspects. I have not checked github yet for alternative firmware which would also be an option I have not looked at but I definitely will be due to the lack of security for the device itself.If you do obtain this wifi extender I would highly recommend using alternative firmware via the \"Upgrade\" option as that would seem the easiest way. The range on this device isn't too bad but it is manageable for the price. Another slight downside would be not being able to change whether the device acts as JUST a repeater or an AP, it kinda acts as both even when matching the SSID and password to the home network; It' create two of the same SSID rather than joining to it. With its' original software it is okay for an average user because of the simplicity and interface that allows easy access to not many settings.",
