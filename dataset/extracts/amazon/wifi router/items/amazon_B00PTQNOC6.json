                "reviewText": "I was already apart of the D-Link family as I was using the DIR-882 but when I saw the DIR-X5460 on sale for Prime day, I had to take the leap despite the upcoming release of WiFi-6E routers in the near future. This is a significant leap from my old router as it has way more horsepower top to bottom with the new Wi-Fi 6 capability. The only two Wi-Fi 6 ready devices I had available to test were my OnePlus 8 phone and a desktop Wi-Fi card I also caught on sale. It boosted my transmit speed on my phone from 866mbps to 1200 mbps! I have a ton of smart home devices and they all connected very quickly. Setup was a breeze and it even automatically updated the firmware to the latest version. I feel very little drop off switching from my desktop from a wired connection to the wireless connection . It even has cloud support to the router to accept voice commands however, I find the functionality for it to be rather buggy and cumbersome. It would be far easier to login to the router and make the needed changes on their simple to use GUI instead of using the voice features which are pretty limited to toggling the guest network status and rebooting the router. I feel I'll be able to get plenty of use out of this router as it will be awhile before Wi-Fi 6e adoption rate is high enough to want to change up from this high performing router. Do not hesitate to buy if you are in the market for another wireless router as you'll be hard pressed to find one with this much power at a reasonable price point.",

                "reviewText": "For almost 8 years, I had been using the same reliable D-Link DIR-880L router. However, when I upgraded my cable modem, the DIR-880L did not allow me to get the full speed provided by my ISP. Hence, I upgraded to the D-Link WiFi 6 Router AX5400. After receiving the new router, I downloaded the D-Link WiFi app onto my phone and scanned in the provided QR code. Everything seemed to go okay, but I did not get any internet connection after multiple attempts. Even when connecting my laptop through ethernet cable, I could not manually set up things in the configuration webpage. I called my ISP to reset the cable modem, but I still could not get internet connection between the cable modem and router. So, I hypothesized that the D-Link provided low profile (thin) ethernet cable might be faulty. I switched to a standard ethernet cable, and, that solved the whole connection issue! This is the fourth time that I have seen faulty ethernet (even brand new) cables from different suppliers through the years. So, if you have internet connection issues during setup, please try another ethernet cable! Anyway, the D-Link phone app is useful to configure separate 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz options; it seems easier to work with this app than the web-based configuration page. Now I get greatly improved speeds though out the house.",

The router, \"itself\", works great, but getting the included option working, was a FARCE, and it still is not working. Problem (1): While trying to work with the tect, it took \"forever\" for her to get back to me after short comments. It was evident she was \"supporting\" multiple clients at a time. Was on for over 1-hour, but talked, in-fact, less that 15-minutes. ->-> Problem NOT solved..!!Problem (2): The Tech support agent had ABSOLUTELY no knowledge of the option, or how to get it working.. ->-> Problem STILL NOT solved.Problem (3): Contacting tech support again, on-line, and informing them of my problems with tech support, and TOTALLY explaining my woes, and requesting a call ONLY got me ->->-> Please call tech support. Technical support on an option, I specifically wanted, (number 2 reason for buying) SUCKS. WISH they would contact me directly, their \"on-line\" support did NOT help.",

I then bought a wifi 6 Network adapter from ASUS and it paired with it the router and its like I'm gaming on ethernet. Its no joke this is gaming grade wifi and I get 29-30 ping in online first person shooters which is basically what I was getting on ethernet. You may be able to achieve 0ping results with this router but my internet is not that good so you will have to try it yourself. ALSO - I am able to game and stream simultaneously with this router with no issues or decrease in my game's ping and I see no lag in the output stream. (For those who stream)",
