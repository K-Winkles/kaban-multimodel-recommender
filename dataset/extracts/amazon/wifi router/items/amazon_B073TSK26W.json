I didn't know I needed this until I got one.I have 3 children and our family likes to take road trips and vacations frequently.As soon as we get to a hotel, the first thing that my kids and my wife want to do is connect their smart phones and devices to the hotel Wifi so they all ask about the password, room number, etcWell, no more of that! I just log into the Admin Panel of this neat device from my phone then connect to the hotel Wifi, and BAM! all my family's smart phones and devices are automatically connected to the Wifi!WHAT I LIKE:[+] very compact yet powerful and pacts so many features![+] micro USB port for powering this amazing device and it can be powered on from portable battery, making it truly portable even on the go![+] option to connect to internet connection using Ethernet cable for those rare places that don't have Wifi yet or has very weak signal[+] USB port for providing Wifi via tethering (it's better than smart phone's hot spot)[+] option to provide internet connection via Ethernet cable for older devices that don't have Wifi capability[+] added security and privacy when connected to Wifi using this MANGO[+] open VPN client option (although I never used it and don't know how to use it yet)[+] also comes with Ethernet cable, micro USB cable, and easy to understand, extensible user manual[+] The admin control panel software is very intuitive and powerful with so many advanced features found in high end Wifi routers[+] price!!! can't beat this price[+] LOVE the color and name MANGO!WHAT I DON'T LIKE:[-] I wish it had more information and instruction on how to use the open VPN client feature[-] It has one switch without a label and I didn't know what it was but I found out that it's for turning on/off the VPN if you are using that featureTHE BOTTOM LINE:10 out of 5 stars! I highly recommend this cute yet amazing device.

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Makes Nintendo Switch work in Hotels",
                "reviewText": "My requirement for this device was fairly specific. I travel every week for work and have begun bringing my Nintendo Switch on these trips with me. The problem is that the Nintendo Switch is notoriously horrible at connecting to wifi with a captive portal (aka registration splash screen). Such as hotels or other public wifi might require for confirmation to connect via a browser window. Basically the Switch hidden browser is worthless for these situations and hardly ever works.So I bought this device as a work around. By using this router to connect to the hotel wifi I only need it to make the connection and then it rebroadcasts my own private network. Which the Nintendo Switch can connect to just like any normal wifi that doesn't use captive portals within internet browsers (such as your home network).Setup was fairly straightforward. Granted I am a Network Engineer so I have a slight advantage. However, I found the instructions easy enough for anyone. My only minor complaint is that the router doesn't start broadcasting unless you toggle the \"mode\" switch located on the side (next to the reset button). The instructions aren't clear on that and the toggle switch itself isn't even labelled (but it is called out in the manual). Anyway turn that on first.Once I had setup the router per the instructions. I went ahead and pre-connected all of my devices (phone, laptop, Nintendo) while it was connected to my home network.Then a few days later I setup the router in a hotel. Using my phone I went to the router IP address (admin menus) and connected it to the hotel wifi. Then I launched a browser via my phone to do the hotel wifi registration. Done.Now the router is on the hotel wifi and all of my devices are connected to the router. One IP address. One registration (instead of having to register multiple times for multiple devices). Turned on my Nintendo Switch and it worked perfectly. No messing around with the Nintendo browser.So in summary. The router works on hotel wifi with captive portal. You only need to perform the hotel registration once and all of your devices are good.For $20 something bucks this just saved me a month of hotel registration headaches that I have been fighting. Thumbs up and highly recommend for anyone else in a similar situation.Side bonus this will give your personal devices an extra layer of protection from those public networks. This router is also very small (about 2x2 inches) so it easily fits inside a Nintendo Switch travel case if you own one.",

I was able to attach it as an extender to hotel wifi. It connected after a couple of tries then I was able use my laptop to authenticate to get full access. My vpn worked with no issue\u2019s. It provided excellent coverage throughout the two bedroom condo. On the downside I was not able to get it connect to the Sanford Fl airport wifi. I keep receiving a connection error. I had to connect with my cell and tether it to the unit. Also the unit does not come with a wall charger. You need to have a usb charger for it to work. Definitely recommend.
