I don't have any equipment that supports AX. I found both work well, providing over 200Mbps on 5GHz band. Very good range in my 2K foot house. The RAX30, takes up less room on my desk so kept the RAX30. Bought NTGR b-grade for $109 which is good price. I'm happy with this purchase. Hope it lasts 5 years.",
