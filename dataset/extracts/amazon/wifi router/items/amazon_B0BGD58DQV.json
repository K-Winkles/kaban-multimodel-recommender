                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars EASY Set-Up, Connected 12 PC's and Macs in 7 Minutes, PURRRFECT Dual-Band Router!",
                "reviewText": "The ease of setup of the Cisco-Linksys E3000 router astonished me! I had a studio and household FILLED with multiple PC's and Macs, both desktop and notebook computers, and a PC server plus Mac G5 server for my AppleTV Library, iTunes Library, and this router self-configured itself with each and every computer/device/system that I own, some 12 machines in total, in less than 7 minutes for the full cycle of the auto-connect feature to take place.That FLOORED me totally, and I'm an advanced networking expert, who was prepared for a completely tough, manual install of this router but figured I'd give it a go with the Auto-Connect Feature of this router, by simply inserting the Cisco-Linksys CD ROM into my PC server's optical drive, and followed the prompts to the letter (to a point), let the router Auto-Configure each and every PC and Mac in my mixed-stable of computers here in my studio and throughout the house, 8 computers here in my studio near the router's plug-in to my Time-Warner RoadRunner HS Turbo Modem, and 4 other computers elsewhere in the house, and I'll be danged if the new E3000 didn't pull off the complete connection routing in less than 7 minutes actual time! CRAZY GOOD!I immediately fired up the router's web interface and went into the Advanced settings, and renamed the System from default to my regular/normal System's name, set up the web interface for my network Hard Drive and plugged in a 1TB USB external HD for network sharing and backup services, reconfigured the password to my rather complex 26-digit and symbol password for ultimate security purposes, set the \"renew DHCP Lease\" to my own specific schedule apart from default, adjusted Media and FTP Server setting to active, and a lot of other \"host services\" to manual settings vs the default settings, and in less than 30 minutes total time I disconnected my former \"N-Spec\" router, and turned the duties over to the new E3000.Suffice to say it's been literally plug and play since then, with only a minor glitch to report, and that was perhaps my own fault but it involved updating the firmware to the latest and greatest, and my update went awry somewhat...I ended up having to re-apply the new patch TWICE before it took and set up correctly, and BAM!! All was well again, settings were intact, and when I restarted the System it fired right up, everything popped up green, blue, and yellow LED's like it's supposed to do, and voila! Firmware update a success, all was well, and the system @ 100%.The Dual-Band aspect of this router gives it a special character, with the ability to transmit and receive signals and data simultaneously, at the same time literally, and maintain its incredible bandwidth in both the 2.4Ghz and 5.8Ghz channels without fault of any sort, and that's an amazing feature! My AppleTV system works significantly better than it did with the old MaxPower N-Spec Routerat full speed ahead, it being a single-band router and some 5 years old at the time I replaced it with the E3000.I find the web interface to be simple, and simplistic too, a nice interaction to work with when you want to customize any features, or change any settings manually vs the router's automatic setups. I have yet to have to restart or \"recycle\" this router after some 5 months of use thus far, which I consider to be very, very unusual given the nature of routers in general, but the Cisco-Linksys E3000 seems to be in a class by itself with respect to sustainability. It is also a router that you can place ANYWHERE with respect to its antennas being all internal (6 of them!), as I have placed it UNDER MY WORK STATION now, and there's no difference in the signal being all-pervasive and strong throughout my studio, and home to boot!I also use the router to handle the Administration of my twin RAID system's web interface, and that uses one of the Gigabit Ethernet Ports of the E3000 and plugs directly into the Areca 1680IX-8 Hardware RAID Controller, and that feature of the router has also worked without fail thus far, no issues at all! I have searched and tried to figure out S*O*M*E* weakness that this new E3000 router has, but alas there is nothing left to write or say with respect to things that are wrong with it, because the dang thing just works 100% for the good!Every day that I use my system here in the studio and throughout my home I marvel at its consistency, it steadfastness, and its power, just incredible in all those aspects of use with my heavy, heavy needs placed upon it, and it's just fantastic. It would be hard to say \"it could be better\", because I just don't know HOW or WHAT we could do so as to make it better than it is right now.I am transmitting millions and millions of bytes of critical information up to Standford University in the Folding@Home program, with 5 active computers in the program here in my home and studio, and it's IMPORTANT that each and every byte gets transmitted up there for the benefit of mankind, and the critical research that the researchers are doing, and this great Cisco-Linksys E3000 keeps the candles \"lit\" in my contributions to the Folding@Home program hour by hour, day by day, and week by arduous week...it just doesn't fail me, and that is all I could ask of it!I never thought I'd say something like this about a router, but this thing is SO FAR AHEAD of everything else out there that you can buy for your home or office use for a high-speed data network, be it from a HD Cable Modem system like what I have with me here, a DSL system, whatever way you can critically look at such a thing as a router which literally is the lifeline between you and the internet, and all it can represent, but I'll say this for the record: I don't think that there's anything better being made today, AT ANY PRICE, ANY CONFIGURATION, ANY SETUP WHATSOEVER THAN THE CICSO-LINKSYS E3000 Router!This thing is King of the Hill! I have actually purchased 4 of them since they were released in early June, 2010. The router that I bought this time went down to Australia to my business partner's home office to use there, because he cannot buy one in Australia at any price: they just aren't offered there yet, so I took it upon myself to score one for him and the network in his home office, and he is just like I am by now: a believer in this E3000 system 100% without qualification, without doubts, and without any negative thoughts whatsoever!It's not every day that we have products this good come into our lives and uses, and this ladies and gentlemen is the best router that the good, old All-American $$$ can buy, bar none, no doubt as to that statement! The Cisco-Linksys E3000 Dual Band Router gets the Wavey Davey 100% Solid Gold and 5-Star Award for Quality, Value, and Performance, bar none! There isn't anything quite like it no matter what other brands you look at, or even other Cisco-Linksys models for that matter, it stands alone as the No.1 router of any type today, in November 2010.Wavey Davey - November 14, 2010",

                "reviewText": "Size: This is really large and requires an area of 13\u201d x 11\u201d approximately on my desk.Ease of Setup:It took me about 5 minutes to open the box, unwrap, and I took 5 minutes to read the quick start guide (not required) and did the setup in about 30 minutes, to disconnect all the cords from the old router and connect to the new one and setup was done. I needed to restart Cable Modem once to make sure that the modem start recognizing the new router.Used a Mac to connect wirelessly as described in quick start guide, but the HTTP URL in the guide did not work for me. I had to use the alternate option to use router IP address 192.168.1.1 to setup. Glitch found: the URL may not work, you will need to use 192.168.1.1 to setupRange of the Router:Very good. My 5GHz channel ranges very well to 50\u2019 and get 50% result of what I get when sit next to the router, which is 56mbps download. But the 2.4GHz channel is not so much, 2.4GHz signal fades away earlier. So, at 50\u2019, I did have very poor result from 2.4GHz channel. I tried connecting to both channel from the same spot 50\u2019 away from the wall, inside which the router is placed.I am blown away with the performance of this router - before buying this router I had one Apple Extreme Airport base station with two Airport Express working as range extender, but still I had few blind spots and the wireless network was not performing well. Sometimes I had spotty connections, streaming was slowing down, so that Netflix (via Roku 2) was showing me spinning circle etc. After I setup this router and connected my YuppTV dongle, Roku 2 and Roku 3, my laptops on th 5GHz network and everything is working smoothly.UIEasy to setup, easy to manage. But I have been a programmer for long time and used to fiddle things, so not sure how people with lesser experience will feel about this, but from other reviews also this is easy to setup.Router Cascading for keeping the old network:Before I purchased this one, as I mentioned earlier, I had a first generation Apple Extreme Airport Base station router and working with 2 airport express extenders. I have almost 30 devices all over the house, regular laptops, tablets and iPads, other utility devices like Garage door opener, Wink hub with GE lights, thermostats etc. So I knew I would not be able to connect all the devices after replacing my original router. To setup all the devices on the new network was going to take some time, considering we have demanding full time job and kids to take care. So, I connected my old Extreme router\u2019s internet port to the EA9500\u2019s ethernet port and restarted Apple Extreme.Voila - my old networking was working too. This is a nice cascading features, I do not know if this is true for all routers, but worked flawlessly on this one.Note: I had to change setup for Airport Xtreme to do this. In Airport Utility, in the Network section, I had to change Router Mode from \u201cDHCP and NAT\u201d to \u201cOff (Bridge Mode)\u201d.Device Prioritization:This is a nice feature in this - I was running some download on my Mac and at the same time had my Roku running netflix. And I could prioritize Roku from the UI setup. Loved the feature. Did not have Netflix stream suffering after this.Overall it is a very good router. I do not have much experience other than Apple Extreme, and it is costlier than this. But to me it is well worth the extra money. In last 4 days, I did not have anybody in the family yelling \u201cMy wifi is not working\u2026.\u201d. However I know that something may go wrong, and if it does, I will update the review accordingly. For now, I am awarding this router 5 stars.Note: I did not receive a detailed user guide in book form. There is a CD inside the package, which has the guide, but one PDF book with many the languages of the world, but I could not find out the instructions in English language. I contacted their customer support. They are easy to reach, and customer support is very polite and courteous, but they could not solve the problem. The rep helped me to find out the booklet online, but with the same result - it is one big PDF with instructions in many languages, but could not find English. A quick CTRL-F or COMMAND-F (on Mac) to search English did not do any result. Not that I need user guide badly, but for such a pricey and upscale product, Linksys should provide a detailed user guide for old school people like me. But this is not a show stopper for the router itself. And customer support is happy to help you anytime for this router, and so the absence of user guide does not matter that much for me.Update: It has been almost two weeks, and the router is working flawlessly. I didn't have any problem in last two weeks. Everything remained same as of the first week of use. At this point I am really happy as I invested the money ($400 is a lot of money to me) into this router.",
