                "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2020",
                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great HW/SW - Easy to use, fast, and satisfactory for complex home networks; i.e., BSD users",
                "reviewText": "The MR2000AC HW has a nice design with no pointy antennae, and has 4 cores. The setup/configuration process was fairly straightforward and is not so smart that you can actually have an advanced network downstream of the device. The LAN and WAN ports are clearly marked and usable - no forced magic in trying to determine the router interface, though it can do that. Initially during setup the MR2000AC unit wants to be \"the router\" and communicate directly with the modem, but this step can be skipped. Ultimately, I want the pair (I bought two of the same for a mesh) to be just an AP (access point) - I already have a openbsd firewall gateway for my network. I was able to setup the wifi address range and carve out the high end of class C for DHCP, using the same class C ip range as my old netgear unit, but only allowing the synology the high end of the IP range - made for an easy migration. I was also able to connect/direct the synology wifi MR2000AC to talk to my local router, and then it all just started working! It took less than an hour to setup and adding the sub unit was a snap. Confusingly, I had difficulty with the manual in setting up the sub AP - that extends the mesh - I could not find the area in the manual to do it. But, after walking through the software - it looks like a virtual desktop in a web browser - I was quickly able to connect the 2nd MR2000AC via the \"Wi-Fi Connect\" applet. It's so cool that the MR2000AC uses a 5GHz back channel to talk to the main unit; that's how mesh works I guess . The software has a nice javascript overlay box with the status on each of the MR2000AC units, and you can observe and inspect bandwidth, mac, and frequency of each device connected. I notice it has support for SNMP, SMB, and can likely act as a sort of low redundancy NAS. I 'saw' the SMB endpoint on the network in my roku or firestick when trying to scan for screen mirroring. The software is extensive, and easy to use. I was able to upgrade the firmware easily and it's smart about it - staging the download before you install. A very polished product. It's only been a week, but I love the HW/SW. Our old netgear was getting crushed physically by the covid19 zooming, etc, and migrating to the MR2000AC pair resolved streaming problems. I placed the mesh units physically separate as to enable the 1300 sqft as best as possibly with minimal effort. The entire house is now covered, onto the deck, and into the backyard, and upstairs as well in the furthest room - still has sufficient connectivity. I put the MR2000AC synologyrouter in the basement connected to the gigabit switch, and the 2nd MR2000AC is on the first floor on the other side of the house - say 20 ft from the synologyrouter. It seems like clients reconnect to the other units with no disconnections. It's awesome.",

                "reviewText": "For our 4,000 sq ft home we deployed 3 of these MR2200ac units to create a mesh network driven by a RT2600ac base station. Setup was very easy with the Synology DS Router mobile app and the resulting network has been super-fast -- 3x faster with one-third the latency of the eero 6 mesh network that we replaced. Bear in mind however that these units are not wall-mountable.",

                "reviewText": "The purchase was intended for, primarily, parental control, and, secondarily, reduce my wifi latency which was around 100ms loaded. Parental controls on this device are excellent, highly configurable and work fine. They implemented virtually every common parental control feature, and I think did a great job at that. And, as a bonus, my WiFi latency now is between 30-40ms, which translates into faster loading sites and less breaks during zoom calls.The device seems excellently built and software is superior, highly configurable and with lots of options and services. I'd say it's at least semi-professional grade. The only downside is that too many configuration options may possibly confuse inexperienced users who don't want to delve too much into intricacies of local wifi network architecture. They might prefer a simpler model than this one.",

No Apple no longer produces the \u201cTime Capsule\u201d.I replaced it with all Synology stuff. Main router, this mesh router to extend range, and a Synology backup drive with 2 - 2 TB drives. System works like a charm. Spectrum tech was right. My slow download speeds were the result of NOT upgrading my old Apple Time Capsule. YES, it was slick having everything in one device, but now gettin consistent 300 mb/sec speeds and I\u2019m happy.",

But did not like the idea of \u00ab ARP \u00bb spoofing my own network.This mesh router does it all and then some... parental controls are advanced enough I can set and forget. My wife loves the \u00ab rewards \u00bb and \u00ab pause \u00bb buttons in safe access. Companion app is simple and accessible. And still very \u00ab powerful \u00bb.I\u2019m not using the \u00ab mesh \u00bb as I only bought one unit. Wifi signal strength is very good for my condo, and the router does a great job of choosing which band (2.4 or 5.0) to use for clients. Already has WPA3 encryption...Over the month I\u2019ve been using this, I have just scratched the surface of what this thing can do. But I would recommend for sure for home use. Maybe even some light business use.The hardware does lack horsepower though when using advanced features like threat prevention and \u00ab quality of service \u00bb functions. For those, more demanding features, I wish I had bought the RT2600AC instead, but it is not available in Canada.",
