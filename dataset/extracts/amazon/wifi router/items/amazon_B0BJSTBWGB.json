I get a strong signal in the other room where the computer is. Moreover, the connection on this is as good as an ethernet cable for download speeds.I will add here, that if I recall, thinking back, it failed to get a good speed until I switched on both the 2.4 and the 5.0 bands despite the literature suggesting one or the other. As if they complement each other. Ever since, it's worked great on two computers with my 200 mb download speed over wireless.",

I try to mimic the old setup from my old wifi rounder and still no go, very frustrating. I was so mad. I then thought maybe I can turn it into a Access Point piggy backing to the old router, and it works, I finally got internet connection. But that is not what I intended it to be. So I try again, and again, and again. Ready to give up...Then my new ARRIS SURFboard SB8200 arrive and let see if the new TP-Link will work together with the new Arris modem. I then called Xfinity to activate the new modem and still no internet. According to the Tech the new modem is activated and it should be working already. I then look at my Xfinity phone app and notice that the old modem is still showing in the account. Also, the app is finally seeing the new modem and asking if I want to activate: which at first it wasn't that is why I called Xfinity to activate. I then went through the activation process and once I refresh my screen it finally showing the correct modem model SB8200. In my surprised the new Tp-Link WiFi router is also see the internet and connected. I was very happy...Now I can setup both NEW and OLD wifi router the way I wanted them to be. New for PC and Games, Old for Camera, Security and Lights. I piggy back the old wifi router to TP-Link and change the channel to 6 (keeping the old router and resetting it with same SSID help speed-up the connection on all previous devices). Now I'm getting the speed I paying for and more...",

I found it easy to install, and the VPN came right up when I configured it, but the range was not as spectacular as I'd hoped. It's a little better than the $30 router it is replacing, but it doesn't cover my entire (small) house with a strong signal, nor does it reach to my detached garage.I also don't like that configuring the router requires setting up an online account. Maybe that gives me some benefit, but I don't know what that would be, and I suspect it's just another example of companies adding \"features\" that benefit them but not the user.",

                "reviewText": "For some context, I run a home business and rely heavily on transferring very large data files wireless from my laptop. I've never used TP-Link in the past, but this had decent reviews so I figured I would give it a try. I'm now regretting that decision. I went through to set up process per the instructions. Everything fired right up and all three channels were active. I have 20 plus devices on the network at both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. I set up all three SSIDs the same as my previous router. Expecting them to either instantly connect with this new router or possibly need a reboot and/or refreshing of the network credentials to connect.My 2.4 gigahertz items would either not connect at all, or would connect and disconnect intermittently. My first thought was possible interference on the default channels or using too wide a bandwidth for each channel leading to increased interference. So, I checked the spectrum in my area and selected the best available channels for both frequencies and made the changes as I always do. For the record, I'm an RF engineer with over 20 years experience.So now that I am using the clearest possible frequencies and my RSSI is booming, I expect to have decent performance. Unfortunately, this was not the case. My 2.4 gigahertz equipment still would not connect or was experiencing intermittent drops. All of my 5 GHz equipment connected with no issues but still intermittently dropped.I made the decision to contact technical support as a sanity check and because nobody can know everything about every piece of equipment. They answered the phone promptly and the technician was courteous. Unfortunately, he led me through the settings and asked me to Make a few changes I didn't necessarily agree with in regards to the channels and bandwidth. I went along with it and tried it but It made no difference. He then asked me to watch it for 24 hours to see if it got better. If not, I was requested to email them back instead of calling. What kind of customer support asks you to wait 24 hours when you are currently experiencing issues and then to contact them by email and hope they get back to you in a reasonable time?So, overall I can say without hesitation that I am not satisfied with this product or their support and will not be buying any of their equipment in the near future. I'm not sure what the issue was, but suspect it wasn't able to handle the 20 or so clients I had attached with all three channels active (2.4, 5.0 #1, and 5.0 #2) due to inadequate processor power and/or memory.So for a simple network with a few clients in a relatively clean RF environment, this might work fine. That being said, who doesn't have many neighbors with Wi-Fi and multiple clients on their network such as phones, security cameras, Amazon echoes, tablets, laptops, gaming systems, etc.?Purchase at your own risk...",
