                "reviewText": "After owning my nighthawk router for years, I decided to finally pull the plug and get a decent router that was not going to fail us miserably. Right off the bat, I noticed that the router wasn't bulky (a major plus) and it included a short ethernet cable to set it with my modem. The instructions were clear, concise and I was able to get it up and running within 5-10 minutes. Upon usage, I can definitely say that this router is reliable in terms of connectivity and pretty fast.Features:The router I purchased has four ethernet ports, one USB 3.0 port, fast wireless connectivity, and even a dedicated app which lets you customize settings to optimize performance for work, gaming, and even casual use. Within the app, you are also able to turn off the LED lights and change the Aura RGB on the router. Not to mention, it also has a security feature to protect against malicious attacks.Performance:The performance on this router is impressive; A major upgrade from what I had before. We tested its performance using various devices, including PCs, laptops, smart TVs, Gaming Consoles and it delivered a fast and reliable connection.UE:The router is easy to set up and use. Once everything is set up, you can use the mobile app-based to manage various settings, including parental controls and QoS optimization. Although, I would say that mobile app design can be a little confusing for those who are locating specific features since some just show icons with no text. Nonetheless, after messing with the app, you will be fine.Conclusion:I can definitely say that this router has impressed me, especially for the price. It's a great choice for people who want something simple yet reliable. Although the UI may throw some people off, this router is a great option for those who value performance and reliability. As time goes by, I can definitely keep this updated.",

                "reviewText": "Updates at the bottom:I\u2019ve purchased this router twice but I ultimately wanted a different set of features.I first purchased this router 2 months ago and love the dual 2.5Gb ports as I have AT&T fiber 2 Gbps tier.I returned it a week or so later.I purchased the router again recently trying to give it a chance with the hardware specs. Ultimately, the router didn\u2019t fit my network needs. After research, Merlin wouldn\u2019t have met my needs either.The good:If you are a gamer, this\u2019ll be great for low lag.Easy setup for dual WAN.Fast CPU that handles all tasks you can throw at it.It\u2019s got nice RBG. I\u2019m not into that so it can be turned off.Wifi is strong and stable.Too many features to list.The bad (in my opinion):Traffic history lacks several options. I like to get info on hours/days/weeks and which devices uses the data.The Traffic Analyzer can take up to 5% of your download peak in my testing.I like to set my reboot cycle monthly but the UI only gives the option of daily or weekly.If my network/internet goes down, I would like some type of notification from the router. This router lacks that feature.Conclusion:This will be a great router for many users but it did not work out for my needs.Update 12/22Purchased the Synology 6600ax router in November and found that device lacking hardware wise, 1 USB and 1 single 2.5 GbE port. Solid software. Returned that router.Re-purchased the GT-AX6000 w/dual 2.5 GbE ports. After some tweaks and the latest 388.1 Firmware and Merlin, I'm satisfied enough to keep this device. The Software can be adapted/tweaked for my needs. The Hardware is solid and the best for future-proofing outside 6E/7 or Tri-Band that this router lacks.5G Wifi speeds over 1Gbps at about 20 Ft is great.",

                "reviewText": "It may be a little difficult to give a review that is completely isolated to this router as I simultaneously updated my service from cable to fiber optic. It was given a new modem as well. My old equipment was over 10 years old at the time that I upgraded, but this new router seems to be amazing. The best way I can tell is how far it reaches out into my yard even though it is not a mesh network, my coverage seems to have doubled in distance. My speeds are off the charts fast now, and again that may have to do with switching services and the new modem as well, but I am very happy with this router, and I would buy again and recommend to my friends and family. If you were in the market for a new router, you should consider buying this one as well. Important note: my house is roughly 1,700 square feet. If you live in a mansion, you may still want to use a mesh network, but for any small to large house, this one should meet all your needs. Plus, it pulses really cool colors and was insanely easy to set up.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as my main router to use, and down the road to purchase another ASUS router to create an AiMesh wireless system.Make sure it\u2019s Aimesh compatible by searching on ASUS website.This router looks like a spaceship, and I love the shape, as I have a thing for NASA and space craft.As for the GUI settings, it\u2019s a make or break experience that will dictate, whether it\u2019s positive, or negative.I own about 10-12 devices I plan on connecting to this router (and the other ASUS router via Aimesh) on my 500Mbps cable line (thinking of upgrading to Gigabit speeds (1Gbps) one day.... no hurry.500Mbps is overkill for a single person, heck, I even think 150-300Mbps is enough for one.If you have a family of 3-6 people, then sure grab the 500Mbps service.Again, whatever your needs are, most users are happy with 150, some need 300/500, then there\u2019s those who want only the best, and fastest - 1Gbps, even 2Gbps is now available via pure fibre, holy moly!As some of us know, the Galaxy Note 10 Plus/S10/Fold and iPhone 11/12/Macbook Pro/Mini (M1 chip) was the first devices to get the Wi-Fi 6 AX standard, and the performance is beyond satisfying!I personally get 1.2 Gps (1200Mbps) from this AX5400 router on my Note10+It\u2019s been stable, reliable, and the speeds are insane.Streaming content, whether it\u2019s in 1080P/4K/8K, plays flawlessly.Again, this is from the system settings I have tweaked over again, and again.It took me 4-5 factory resets to make it right to my satisfaction.Remember to save the settings to your mobile device, or your computer.Everyone will have different outcomes, but one thing for sure, is to make it work for your needs.Make sure your MODEM is in BRIDGE MODE, when connecting a router to it.Power on the ASUS router, and don\u2019t just plug in the Ethernet Cable (default cable is usually a Cat6, some users have Cat7).I personally use Cat8 (latest cable) and it can handle some serious data bandwidth.Should log you in automatically to the router via your smartphone, tablet, HDTV, or computer (first time) or type in manually if you need, router.asus.com or 192.168.1.0 or 192.168.1.1When prompted to insert the cable to the WAN port (pay attention by looking at the colour, it\u2019s usually blue, sometimes even red (depends on brand/model of router).The LAN port(s) are usually yellow.The router will automatically detect the modems connection.Enter the routers SSID, and password ( and please, don\u2019t use some lousy passwords people).For those who can\u2019t remember passwords, use a password manager on your computer/smartphone (lots of apps available for Android/ iOS/Windows or just temporary, on paper).Once the SSID and password is done, click next, and enter the routers login name, and password (to prevent someone from accessing the routers GUI)Many people don\u2019t set this up, and you\u2019re just asking for trouble.If someone (like a hacker or just a rotten person) logs in the router, they will have access to your router, and they will lock you out, even the modem, altogether.Their intentions is never good, and it\u2019s such an inconvenience.Once you have successfully setup the router, I would spend some time to learn how to use it by viewing YouTube, or Google.There\u2019s a ton of info on the net.Make sure to document all the login/passwords for your modem, router, and it\u2019s login page.Once that\u2019s all done, enjoy it, I sure am!Hope this helps someone out there!",
