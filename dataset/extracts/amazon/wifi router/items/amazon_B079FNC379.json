                "reviewText": "It was good while it last in the 9 months that I left it plugged into the charger next to my desk. Luckily it managed to work when I first inserted the T-Mobile prepaid SIM card which is sold for USA use. To keep track of my data usage as shown on the tiny screen, it took me many months to find out how to reset the counter to zero whenever I change to a new SIM.Go to main menu, press bottom right corner \"Reset\" button. OR, press Router tab, then Reboot button. Shut down this router, replug and counter will show something like 3600 B, then gradually rise to MB and GB as you surf the web. If it doesn't reset to something close to zero, repeat the Reset buton process as described.To pay US$50 for 9 months use is pricey, so I have now moved to USB plug-in router which I got for US27. It has 4G but does not show LTE. However, although this KuwFi router displays LTE on the tiny screen, I still could not get any fast internet, very often sputtering when watching youtube movies, or just the CNN video news.I was willing to pay US50 only because it was difficult to find such a router which run easily on USA T-Mobile SIM card without the hassle of tweaking other brands. That is because most routers in USA default to AT&T cards, and only some wiz nerds know how to tweak them to run other brand carrier SIM.",
