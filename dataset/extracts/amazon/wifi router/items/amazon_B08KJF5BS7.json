The router supports WiFi 5 (802.11ac), and has the ability for smart connection (the ability to combine 2g and 5g bands into one channel). It also has the ability of WPA3 encryption which is always important for WiFi users. The router has a user friendly GUI, it\u2019s very well organized and easily manageable. Has 1 WAN port and 4 LAN ports for ethernet connection. I\u2019m overall satisfied with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to extend the WiFi range in my household, one end of the house has Gigabyte internet with Frontier router 1000mbps up and 1000mbps down. WiFi however, the speeds get turned down to about 500mbps if near the router, and only a mere 20mbps on the other side of the house.I originally tested this router as a replacement to the one issued by the internet company. The results were not amazing (as expected) it performed on the same level as my original router with little to no increase on the other side of the house.On my second test, I ran a internet cable from one end of the house to the other and connecting this router to the original one from my internet provider. After setting it up as an access point for it. I now receive constant speeds all around the house. One router handling traffic of one side of the house. While this one manages the other side.Set up was relatively easy, and have not had to manage it since it was set up. For the price, functionally is good, and rage was as expected. I would definitely recommend. However, if you are looking to cover a big house with this router I would look elsewhere, or investing in their mesh network. It allows for you to hook up various routers into one single mesh network which can operate seamlessly.",

                "reviewText": "I had to contact Technical Support a few days after another call as my connected equipment kept losing their IP Address. The Agent (Glen Ford) helped my discover that my configuration was incorrect.I had an Ethernet Switch between my modem and router - with equipment connected to the switch. Since my modem only issues one IP Address (the modem has a single ethernet port), my connected equipment was batteling for that single address and my computer directly connected to the router was losing connectivity every time the router power was reset. The agent instructed I completely remove the switch (it acted more like a splitter than intelligent) and directly connect my router to the modem. I used the router ports for my near by equipment and connected my second router (other end of house) to the first and after setting separate IP addresses for each router, it all works steady now.Mr Ford was very patient with me, knowledgeable and knew just the right time to call in other tech support to validate the thinking. In an age where most software and hardware vendors hide their phone number or simply don't make it known, TP-Link is right their. They also have live chat support 24 hours a day.",
