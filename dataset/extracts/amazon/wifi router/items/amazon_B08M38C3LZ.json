This brand is well designed and easy to install. After inserting the AP from the back into the mount the cable fits snugly into the sleeve and wraps around four times, ending perfectly, opposite the plug, in order to plug into the AP. Then it was easy to configure it with my existing WiFi network using the Google Home app the UPC code on the back of the AP. Now I have great coverage throughout the house and perimeter.",

They are easy to install and require no tools or holes in the wall. They also help protect the units from kids and pets by getting them up and out of the way. One thing that might be improved is creating easy access for hard-wiring network devices to the routers, especially for your main unit, which will need to be plugged into a modem (I am only using these on my extenders, so that's not an issue for me).",

I was using a variety of wifi extenders with fairly good coverage but the 4 different zones made it difficult to move around from room to room, etc. and maintain coverage. This Google wifi mesh system is amazing. I bought 2 packs of 3 and have set up 4 of them [first one becomes a router for the system-pictured in an optional mounting device and attached to my modem/router] and placed the other 3 in locations where I had previously had extenders. The setup is very easy and instantaneously I had full property and every room continuous wifi network coverage--all one big mesh zone. Some of the points are outside, but under cover. Hopefully the salt air will not destroy them too quickly. This is a great system!",
