That allowed me to get all my cameras, Sonos system and computers up in minutes.The only downside is the router is not as compatible with most VPN software for whole home protection.",

                "reviewText": "I was excited to receive this and purchased as my previous wireless router was getting old. It was supposed to be a seamless process of plugging in and setting it up using an app. Unfortunately, although it showed signal, the wifi would not work at all in any devices. After 3 hours on the phone with DLink and him attempting multiple things, the router still would not provide an internet signal. It was first blamed that maybe it was my devices (MacBook and IPhones). After another few resets repeating the exact same process, the tech support then determined it was actually my internet modem (although, old router worked just fine with current modem) and that I would have to reach out to my internet company to get it working. I contacted my internet company who advised my internet modem was fine, performed a few additional tests and said that this is a faulty product.I would say the tech support for DLink was not at all helpful, but instead made me to feel as though I was dumb because their product wouldn\u2019t work and was finding ways to blame all the products within the home.Just writing an honest review for those in the future looking to purchase a budget friendly wireless router.",
