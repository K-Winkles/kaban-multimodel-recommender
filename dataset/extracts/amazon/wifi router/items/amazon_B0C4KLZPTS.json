This allows for even faster wireless connections and improved performance, especially in environments with many concurrently connected devices. WiFi 6E (E=Extended): Wi-Fi 6E extends the available frequency range of the 802.11ax standard to the 6 GHz band (5925 - 7125 MHz), resulting in more available channels and further increasing bandwidth.",

Bluetooth and internet working fine all the same. I eventually will upgrade my wifi card to something more current hopefully with some 'Blueteeth 5.2' to bite more airwaves. Magnetic bases are strong... you have to put them on bare metal and they work great.",

                "reviewText": "This external antenna set is designed to improve reception for LTE hotspots, routers, or WiFi adapters that have TS9 connectors. Keep in mind that TS9s are different from the threaded SMA coaxial antenna connectors found on many home routers and high end PC WiFi cards. The actual antennas in this kit use SMA to connect them to the magnetic bases, but the bases' extension cables terminate in a TS9.I seriously doubt the 10db signal boost claim, but if you're currently using a device's built-in, internal antenna, then these should provide better signal strength at a decent price, especially if you place the antennas as high up as the cables permit. Also makes a good set of spares for direct mount router antennas.",

The cable length is good without being too excessive, and they have a magnetic base to easily mount the antenna on a metal surface. The magnet isn't that powerful, and the antenna has a folding design allowing it to be mounted in different positions or angled as-needed, but this means it's less stable in a mobile environment... i.e. don't expect to place the antenna on your car for better signal because it will either bend over sideways or just fall off because the magnet isn't strong enough.",

My Lenovo tiny PC came with a wi-fi card installed but needed an antenna, so this resolved that. I am likely to see what it takes to add a wi-fi card into my Raspberry Pi system, Bluetooth can be a pain.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Better than some of the competition, but not as good as internal Netgear LM1200 antennas.",
                "reviewText": "This is the second set of inexpensive external 4G LTE antennas I try out. The first pair did much worse than stock internal antennas. I was hoping for better results with these, but no luck. While these perform better than the other set, they are no better (actually slightly worse on the download) than internal stock antennas.As you can see from one the attached image, the average download speed dropped from 67 Mbps to 53.82 Mbps. Notice there is an outlier in the downstream sample that came in at 39.44 Mbps. If I throw that out, there is a larger delta between the two tables.Ironically, the upstream bandwidth improved 26.82 Mbps to 31.74 Mbps. Notice there is an outlier as well. Which I did not drop in my calculations.Conclusion, while I experienced a slight increase in upstream speed, it does not warrant carrying around the antennas (with long cables) when I go on a trip. I'll stick to the internal stock antennas and hope for the best.",
