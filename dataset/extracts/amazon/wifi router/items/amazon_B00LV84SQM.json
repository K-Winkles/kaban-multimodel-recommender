As the number of Wi-Fi-enabled devices in your home increases, wireless-AC makes it possible for you and your family to simultaneously stream movies, music or play online games without interruption from a slow network connection. Includes a USB 3.0 port and four gigabit ports that let you connect multiple devices and increase your storage space. Beamforming Creates Stronger, Faster Connections Features beamforming, an innovative technology that optimizes the wireless signal strength between your connected devices and router. Beamforming enables the router to identify and connect directly with other devices, rather than simply sending out wireless signals in a general direction. This results in faster network speeds, better wireless range, and reduced interference from other devices. It also helps extend the battery life of connected devices and reduce their power consumption because data is transferred more quickly. Manage Your Home Network Remotely with Linksys Smart Wi-Fi With Linksys Smart Wi-Fi you can access and control your home network from wherever you are using your smartphone, tablet, or computer. For example, you can set parental controls to restrict Internet access during certain times of the day and create unique, secure Wi-Fi passwords for your guests. You can also monitor activity on your home network, add new devices, and check upload and download speeds. In addition, Linksys Smart Wi-Fi allows you to prioritize which devices on your network receive the most bandwidth to reduce lag times and buffering when you're streaming HD media or gaming. Your Linksys Smart Wi-Fi account also gives you access to a growing suite of apps that provide new ways to control and interact with your home Wi-Fi network.",

                "reviewText": "I have one that is not a refurb and I would give it 4 stars. I have liked Linksys for some time and have LOVED CISCO for a while.Buying a refurbished device is always a gamble. They generally fall into 2 basic categories: \"Buyer didn't like it and sent back a perfectly fine box\" (that cant now be sold as new) and \"Defective equipment that will pass the most basic of tests.\" If it is returned and will run the most basic set of tests for 1 minute, the manufacturer certifies it as working and resells it. That's what I got this time. It works great for 30 to 90 minutes. Then all wireless connections stop working. Other people on the same cable modem and router keep working fine, but everyone on this router freezes. After a reboot it is again fine for 30 to 90 minutes. I am virtually sure this box will be \"re-certified\" and sold to someone else. I had higher expectations since CISCO now owns this company and knows a few things about \"burn period\" and \"intermittent failure\".UPDATE: After 1 hour of inline CHAT and then 30 minutes on the phone that got disconnected, I tried one more time to get an RMA. After another 20 minutes I was told that since I purchased it at Amazon, I had to email in a JPEG of the receipt to get an RMA number. I did that while still on the phone. After 24 hours it has not arrived. I will throw this GARBAGE away before I will waste any more time talking to Linksys.DO NOT BUY THIS REFURBISHED.",

Right next to the unit my computed showed 300Mbps (in the wireless connection status window) and several speed tests confirmed I was receiving our maximum ISP upload/download rates using the EA6400. Our verizon router maxed out around 20-25 Mbps. The EA6400 provides our full speed of ~55Mbps (5Ghz) next to and one floor down from it. The 2.4Ghz is almost as fast reaching about 40-50Mbps. The 2.4Ghz range shows 2/5 bars in our basement, 2 floors down, which is disappointing. The price was right when I bought this, but there are likely better options out there.",

He then decided to check for any updated software from Linksys and found the latest version. That did the trick! The unit provides superior coverage throughout our 2900 sq ft 2 story home as compared to our older E2500 and E1000 Linksys routers and full 100mbs download speeds from our Spectrum cable internet when in the same room as this on our N devices and that speed on my iPhone6 with AC from where we hang out in the family room, 30 feet and 2 walls away. He tested this after DD-WRTing the E2500 and E1000 routers, but the speeds are faster without them running, even with 2-3 interior walls in between. We opted for the inexpensive Squaretrade 2 year warranty on this refurb item, a total no-brainer addition. This is a true bargain for a budget AC router.",

My gaming console, laptop, phones, tablets, etc. can all connect simultaneously and have decent speeds now. Took away one star due to setup. Refurbished device had settings and needed to be fully reset before it would allow proper setup. Simple fix for myself, as I work in IT, but the regular joe might take a moment to figure it out.
