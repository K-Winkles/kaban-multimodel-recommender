It\u2019s a dealbreaker to have a powerful extender share data with anyone in the vicinity of my house because of weak security. This is the question I posted that was answered by the seller:Q: The 2.4 and 5G networks both have \"weak security\" messages in AP and Repeater modes. My router is at WPA2 AES. How do I strengthen the security?A: You can use this wifi repeater for itYou plug this and connect your router thought this repeater using the same passwordBy Winter Seller Hub in the United States on February 8, 2024I purchased another repeater/access point at the same time as this one and it doesn\u2019t produce the \u201cweak security\u201d message when connecting to its 2.4 or 5 GHz. This one goes back to Amazon so I can purchase the other one - too bad because this router is otherwise excellent. Buy it if you think a great passcode is enough to secure your network, but do your homework if you want to avoid the possible hassle of identity theft.",
