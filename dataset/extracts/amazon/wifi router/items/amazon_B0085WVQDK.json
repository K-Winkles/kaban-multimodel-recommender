I was disappointed to discover that the product came without instructions, support or an installation CD. The only documentation was a little piece of paper directing me to the Netgear website where I would find the installation wizard download and instructions. There is no download and the only instructions were some basic wiring diagrams followed by \"then insert the installation CD.\" The telephone support would not help because the unit was \"REFURB\" which I didn't realize until after placing the order. The free email support was a computer generated response that was totally useless. But there was a happy ending due to an incredible coincidence. My roommate's computer tech showed up to repair her computer just as I was packing up the router for return. He had the router up and running in less than 10 minutes, without the installation CD and completely disregarding the Netgear website. As for the router... it is working fine. It is much faster and provides a much stronger signal than the deceased Linksys that I purchased just six months ago. I just hope I don't have to install it again or need support. But now I know what \"manufacturer refurbished\" means.",

Then my wireless signal failed to the point that I currently have 25% signal strength from 3 feet away. I've spent over a month working with Netgear support trying to get the issue resolved or the unit replaced, but it's a hardware problem and they do not support refurbished products. In the end, it is beyond my 90 day return window and Netgear won't do anything for me, so I spent $ 6 0 on a standard gigabit router. This does me absolutely no good at all.I purchased this product because of Netgear's good name. After the unit failed, I searched and discovered this is an extremely common problem with this series. Don't get screwed, but a different brand.",

                "reviewText": "The router is nice with some cool features. There are a lot of other routers that you can find if you are just looking for dual band routers (with or without USB). But this one is OpenWRT and DDWRT supported router. Spend your money on this if you are interested in attaching a network drive and stream media from that drive. I love watching movies over DLNA, network share etc. and this solves the purpose. For fun you can also host your http and/or ftp servers over internet.One thing though, the writing is not very nice over the network. for example if you are transferring your media from your laptop to the network drive, dont expect superfast speed. Go for a higher CPU based router for that.Its been a month using the router and no issues with it, yet :)EDIT.....after 1.5 months i mistakenly disconnected the router power supply and found that router was unable to connect to the internet. I tried to debug it for 3 hrs, it was definitely frustrating. Finally when i was about to give up i thought of directly connecting to modem and try upgrading my firmware (i dont know how i thought of this even when router always showed me that there was no router update before it went rogue). So, i downloaded and did the upgrade and it started working. Dont know why but it is working now.Reduced the rating from 5 to 4 stars because of frustration. agh...--------------------------On a different note: if you are planning to host a file server on the router (via the USB port on the router) let me warn you that the file transfer rate it not impressive. Might be something like 1.5 MBytes/sec. so it might be good for a 1080p movie but not when u are taking periodic backups of files like 20 GBs. Get a router with a good processor for that. Although the network speed is super fast, u need not worry about that",

The range and speed were good, when it worked right, but I think products like this should last much longer. Cannot recommend for the price.",
