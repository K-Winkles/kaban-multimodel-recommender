                "reviewText": "I chose this router to update my wifi in the house, my criteria was coverage and speed since the old router was starting to show it's age.After reading the reviews the Netgear RAX 120 was my choice, it has the coverage at 3500 sqft and the speed hit the target, an added plus was multi device usage without the lag.To address some issues I have seen in reviews.1. Set up: From what I saw in most unsat reviews the people that were unhappy used the app to setup the router. I started with this process and quickly saw how this could be frustrating. I would HIGHLY recommend you hardwire setup with pc, it is a MUCH easier process.2. Firestick: So far, I can start up just about all of my apps on my firestick, I do have one that gives me problems and that's my Dish app. For some reason it shuts down router and it only happens on tv's and not kindle or phone. That being said, I have only had to restart router once so far so this is a puzzle.3. Real world performance: I have about an 1800 sqft home, the old router I had dead spots. This router performs like a rhino on steroids. Old router I could barely get a signal in the garage, now I can go across the street to the neighbors front door and still have a signal. There is no lag, since this is fast and can handle multiple devices at the same time without issue, I do not get the occasional clocking spinner in center screen.Conclusion: This is a good router if you keep it simple. I am sure other users have tweaked it to their liking but for most of us who buy product and plug it in and expect it to work this router will do.02/23/2022 - Update: I am sorry to say I have to return this router and lower the rating. The reboot and restart reviews I have read are true and I have experienced them for myself. I am not willing to spend hours or days to try and hash out problem since I don't want to miss my return window and I don't feel like double talk. I think as a consumer that when you get something like this that it should work out of the box with little or no issues. I did set this up correctly and as I have mentioned I did it hardwired. When it works it is great but the reboots several times a day is annoying.03/11/2022 Traded in the RAX120 for RAX70, the differences between the two are subtle.When the RAX120 worked it was awesome, the range and the speed were just outstanding.The problem with the RAX as I have mentioned is the constant reboot.I traded this in for a RAX70, this router is just as good if not better.RAX70 is a triband router and is wifi 6 however the range is a little shorter by 1000 ft, in my house I do not notice the difference. This router I have had for about 2 weeks now and I must say it is solid, no resets or reboots.I have a theory which is the RAX series 120 and 200 might have program issues but maybe heating problems too. I bring this up because I noticed when I turned on the fan permanently for the RAX120, the reboots were fewer but they still happened.",

                "reviewText": "I have had many Netgear routers throughout the years and had good results with the majority. My family household streams television as our primary source of entertainment and we subscribe to 500mbps of internet speed from the local cable company.About 1.5 years ago, my brother bought me the R9000 model and it was a beast until a power surge killed it. Fortunately, he purchased the warranty insurance from Amazon and square trade refunded the money in full.In 2019 I purchased a r6700 from Amazon during a lightening sale as a backup and I am glad that I did. I put this router into service when the R9000 failed and it did a fairly decent job. My home is about 3000 sq feet and the WIFI coverage was fair and it held the internet speed sufficiently enough for streaming, but I did encounter some buffering in the bedrooms.I was going to repurchase another R9000 from Amazon but the price was 100.00 more than the original price my brother paid so I decided to wait for a lightening deal special and use the R6700 until Amazon offered another deal.On February 1st, Amazon promoted a Netgear special and I came across the RAX120 at a discounted promotion. I read the reviews and was skeptical about buying it. Some of the negative reviews posted on Amazon and other competitor\u2019s websites complained about problems with this router. Time was running out and I did not want to miss the special so I made the investment.DID I MAKE A MISTAKE!!The R6700 worked better than this piece of junk. Many customers posted problems with the wifi cutting in and out, inadequate internet speed and drop outs. I experienced them all. I had to reset this router 4 times within 24 hours because of internet disconnections from the cable modem. The wifi signal was strong on my first floor, but it only broadcasted one bar to the second floor. Netgear advertises that the wifi will cover up to 3500 sq. feet, but it did not perform in my house. The internet speed was cut in half or more and buffering was an issue.For example, I pay for 500mbps and the RAX120 wifi was broadcasting 250 mbps in the same room as where the router is located, 50 mbps on the second floor, and 30mbps in some of the bedrooms.The R6700 as cheap as it is, worked better than the RAX120 and broadcasted well over 500 mbps on the entire first floor and 250 mbps on the second floor. I am familiar with setting routers up and the firmware was updated to the most recent version. I tried different settings and I still could not get this thing to run efficiently.After researching the internet extensively looking for solutions, it appears that the firmware is very buggy for this unit and others had recommended the RAX200 over the RAX120. Netgear customer service if useless and it\u2019s hard to interpret their customer service representatives\u2019 accents. The waiting times are high and I do not have time to wait 50 to 60 minutes for the basic runarounds script instructions. I guess this is the reason that Amazon had given such a significant discount price on this router. I am going to pay the extra 100.00 and upgrade to the RAX200. If the RAX200 does not work then I am switching to another brand. It is terrible that the R6700 outperformed this high-priced router. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED that Netgear would release a product with such flaws at a high price and not correct the problem since it\u2019s release one year ago.Follow up: I purchased the rax200 and what a nightmare. The original came on time and setup went well. I updated the firmware and everything appeared good for about 48 hours. The WiFi signal weakened, and the download speeds went from 500 to 35. I had to reset the cable modem and the router every couple of hours. Very annoying!! I factory reset the router and it seemed to help for a few hours then it was back to low speeds again. I have my local channels running through Kodi and the low mbps speeds caused significant buffering to the point where I could not watch television. The audio was out of synch from the slow WiFi. I tried various setting and recommendations that others had posted on the netgear website and nothing seemed to work. I attached my R6700 and everything worked like a well oiled machine minus the WiFi range.There is definitely a problem with these nighthawks. At this point I notified amazon for an exchange because I really wanted this to work because of the WiFi range. Amazon authorized the exchange and shipped out the new one. I came home from work to find the router laying on my steps, not packed in a shipping box. Man, was I shocked to see this because amazon usually mails there products in a packing box. I was shocked that they would leave a $600 router in plain view for anyone to walk off with. I have their photo of delivery as proof. I set the exchange unit up and immediately detected a strong sweet burning smell coming from the fan area when it turned on. The smell was actually making me nauseated, smelling the room up. I continued the setup and I could not get the WiFi to work. I must of factory reset the router and modem at least 10 times with bad results. I finally got the router to broadcast a signal but the speeds ranged from 15 to 60 mbps. I continued trying different settings and had no luck of getting the WiFi close to 500 mbps. The speed coming from the modem to the router hit the 500 mark but the WiFi is a sham with constant drop outs and signal loss. I do not know how others are saying that this is a great router because the firmware is very buggie. I had great results with the r9000, r6700 and other netgear products throughout the years, but this router is far ready from primetime. It is not worth spending the $600.00. I expect the cream of the crop for this amount of money but instead I got piece of junk. I am very disappointed in netgear because I really need the extra WiFi range in my household. I did as many other dissatisfied customers and returned the router for a refund. I hope others find my review useful.",

WOW!), sono rimasto davvero impressionato dalla velocit\u00e0 di trasferimento raggiunta: quasi 100 MBytes al secondo!!! Sto usando 2 HDD (uno clone dell'altro) collegati via usb al router RAX120 e sul mio pc uso una scheda wifi 6 AX3000 (su PCI express con 2 antenne esterne), e ad una distanza di circa 10 metri, riesco a scambiare sui 85 MBytes al secondo! Anche il mio Surface 7 Pro scambia dati con una velocit\u00e0 che varia tra i 25 e i 60MBytes al secondo!Finalmente lavorare via WiFi sulla mia rete interna, non \u00e8 mai stato cos\u00ec rapido e piacevole!!!Riesco a scambiare giga di dati in pochi minuti!Il router per ora sta girando in modo stabile 24/7 e grazie all'app mobile posso sempre tenere sotto controllo i dati pi\u00f9 importanti riguardo la mia rete. Sicuramente non posso fare altro che consigliarne l'acquisto!P.s. Se non potete posizionarlo in un posto areato, vi consiglio almeno di aumentare lo strato dei piedini, anche con semplici feltrini sovrapposti (io ad esempio ne ho messi tre strati), al fine di garantire un minimo di passaggio di aria sotto al router. Per via dell'hardware in uso e delle performance fornite, \u00e8 normale che si scaldi pi\u00f9 di un comune router WiFi 5 o inferiore.",

                "reviewText": "This router replaces a Nighthawk XR500 that\u2019s being sent back for replacement after it went faulty. I\u2019ve been watching this router for a while and it\u2019s firmware updates and when the XR500 gave up I thought it\u2019s time to move on.Very easy to set up with either the app or web page, I entered the same credentials and everything connected straight away. The XR was different as it was constant messing to get even Echo devices to connect.The web page and app are basic and not complicated and within 10mins it was up and running after the firmware updated. I turned off AX mode as I have no AX devices and it\u2019s very stable so far.Wi-fi coverage is excellent, way better than the XR. I have 2 NETGEAR Ex8000 extenders as I had dead areas but now it just covers the property but I\u2019m using one extender as it has some wired connections from other devices. I noticed too the extender now connects at max strength. For example my Arlo security cameras connect to extender and streaming is now butter smooth with their app and Apples HomeKit.I\u2019m also on BT and there is no issue but I\u2019m running a HG612 modem and not a home hub which I prefer.The specs are impressive, 64bit with good ram and cpu power as indicated in the spec. Perfect for streaming and gaming without the complex software many gaming routers supply. It\u2019s a set and forget device.QoS is basic and I\u2019ve left it off and have streamed and gamed at the same time without any issues so far. A very capable router thanks to its spec.I\u2019ve also noticed as I\u2019m using smart connect it\u2019s working well at roaming and allocating devices to different channels ie. 2.4 or 5Ghz. Both web page and app show what\u2019s connected to what channels and you can turn off devices if need be. Again this is a vast improvement and does the work for you. I\u2019ve in total 15 devices connect to the network and it\u2019s not even pushing it.There is a small fan to keep the temp down, it\u2019s not come on yet and the case is slightly warm to touch, not surprising with the cpu power this router has.To round up if you want a Wi-fi 6 router or just a good modern up-to date router you can\u2019t go wrong. Set it up and forget it\u2019s there, perfect.",
