I then got 4 different extenders 2 by d link and two by NETGEAR. Neither extenders mattered. I had an hp printer that would show connected and print via cell and tablet however not by an Windows 10 laptop.I checked but a few weeks out of return. The was button has never worked. I contacted support and got of course a barely English speaking person. He after getting all information said he doesn't know anything about routers and printing. He then asked if I wanted a case number and I said no what good is it.Amazon did refund the purchase. The other extenders were returned for refund.",

                "reviewText": "My first D-Link wireless router was a DI-624 that I purchased about 10 years ago. The wireless in the DI-624 started to drop connections, so a year ago I purchased a DIR-880L AC1900 to replace the DI-624's wireless capability. I moved the DI-624 in between the cable modem and the DIR-880L and disabled the wireless on the DI-624. This added another layer of protection and let the DI-624 handle all the crap network traffic (such as port scanning). Well, my faithful DI-624 died. So, I purchased the DIR-866L to replace it. Might be overkill, but I love the granularity of the user interface and configuration options. Very satisfied.1/2/2016 update: My DAP-1650 (wireless access point extender) connects to my DIR-880L via 2.5GHz and 5GHz with no issues. My DIR-880L connects to my DIR-866L via wired Ethernet. My DIR-866L connects to my cable modem. No dropped connections or router reboots from any of these three devices. Been running like a champ for three days, now.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for cloud storage as an alternative to building or buying a NAS. I mainly wanted an easy and automated way to back up and stream the media from my various tablets and smartphone. I have to say i am dissapointed. It Won't work with my external hard drive even though it is a 1 terabyte nfsa file format. It works fine with my mom's external hard drive though. My hard drive works fine on the netgear ac1750. Range is ok. Speed is good though. Also the my share port app for Android is abysmal for cloud storage. It is more designed to stream with. Clunky interface, slow, and kind of complex for what I wanted to do with it. The netgear ac1750 with two USB ports is a much better bang for your buck. It has 1 usb 2.0 for a network printer and a usb 3.0 for an external HD. The Netgear cloud app for Android is much better designed and has options to automatically back up your pictures and videos, which is exactly what I wanted with this router. I have no experience with this router and the dlink webcams, maybe that's where it could shine. But as a personal cloud I don't recommend this dlink. Go with netgear instead.",

                "reviewText": "Great router for the money. It was one of the best in 2014 when it first came out and still is in 2017. The web based UI is better on the eyes than even older Linksys routers I've used. The auto scan for the best channels to broadcast is good for those that don't know what that's about and have a lot of other WiFi close by like in an apartment complex, duplex, etc.However, I still manually changed my 2.4 channel to get it to -48dBm. For those that don't know -50 is ideal. Anyways, I suggest this for those with some tech knowledge, patience, or both. Don't buy this for your grandma or those that need plug and play. This was mostly plug and play but WiFi needing some tweaking. No firmware updates were available. I would definitely buy again. It was $60 and increased all download speeds wired and wireless by 10Mbps per device.",
