I have to say the ASUS RT-AX3000 is probably the best router in this price range in my opinion. I set it up in under ten minutes using the old school browser method. Typed in the gateway address and got the ball rolling. I don't like using a phone app to set up routers and I don't like signing up for stuff. It was easy to set up and it's been solid since day one. The Asus GUI/control panel looks much nicer than Netgear's control panel and is laid out much better. Also, the wifi range is excellent and nothing drops. It's doing what a router should do.. sitting in a corner collecting dust and chugging along.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this device to pair with my current ASUS AC68U router using the Ai-Mesh system. Setup was easy, however, I did have a lot of problems in the beginning with constant dropping of signals and dropping of the Ai-Mesh on the hold. After factory resetting the both routers and starting over I was able to successfully setup the system and have a strong, stable WiFi Mesh System. I am using the AX-3000 Router as the main and the AC68U as the secondary. After some firmware updates, my signal is stable and very rarely requires any intervention from me. You can set the system to do an automatic reboot one different days and times so your system is always in good shape. I have no issues except sometimes the occasional hiccup when trying to do a firmware update. Signal strength and speed is excellent. I have approximately 20 devices and they all perform very well with my setup.This router also features VPN support which works very well as well. I have tried it with both NordVPN and ExpressVPN and they both worked without problems. I love the accompanying mobile APP which gives you all the necessary information and control without having to log into the router using a laptop or desktop.Parental controls are good and allows you to control your kids devices at a decent level. The router also has built in firewall and antivirus which gives a greater level of protection as data is checked at the router level before reaching your device.ASUS issues firmware updates regularly fixing bugs and security vulnerabilities ensuring your network is safe and stable. You may find cheaper alternatives to these routers however, you may not get these ongoing updates. This is what makes these devices a great investment as they get better over time.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Great management interface, good WiFi range but need some help for entire house coverage",
                "reviewText": "OVERVIEW: Good router, fantastic management interface (can use web interface or phone app), good range, fair price, solid warranty, great reputation for hardware updates. Somewhat complicated set-up, watch out for MAC setting during installation. Range not as good as Netgear Nighthawk (R7000/AC1900). If your house isn't too big, this router could provide enough coverage for the home and would be worth considering, especially if you'd like to upgrade to WiFi 6. For a large home, I suggest considering a Mesh WiFi networking solution instead.DETAILED REVIEW: I was using a Netgear Nighthawk before this ASUS RT-AX3000. I gave up on the Nighthawk after the latest firmware update from Netgear AGAIN broke the Nighthawk. After the update it was patched against FragAttack but then my router had to be rebooted every 1-2 days or WiFi would stop working. Or is that the purpose of the patch.. break WiFi so you can't be hacked? After having had firmware updates break the router a number of times before (last time was in December of 2020, right around Christmas - applied an update, broke router, had to factory reset, install firmware update and then reconfigure my entire network, which took about 3 hours; I have a complicated setup), I decided to try something else.I had always heard of ASUS so did some research. This router meets many of my requirements: WiFi 6 (so my newer devices could benefit from the added speed), professed good range, reasonable price and good reviews. I also think ASUS has a great reputation when it comes to reliable and frequent firmware updates. Additionally, ASUS offers a 2-year warranty for routers in the USA (it may vary in the rest of the world, not sure). This is twice as long as Netgear's basic warranty (1 year only), so I felt confident in this router choice.Received the router, and it took a while to install. ASUS's quick installation doesn't allow you to update the MAC address/clone the MAC originally registered with the internet provider, so at first I was getting a RED internet connection light. After digging through the config (which I could only do AFTER ASUS setup finished), I found the issue. I then updated the MAC address using the \"MAC Clone\" feature to match what my internet provider has registered for my account. Still didn't work, so I had to call the internet provider and they had to unlock my account as they saw the wrong MAC trying to connect (they thought someone was hacking my account). After 15 minutes on the phone, finally, the ASUS was on the internet. Now,I could test it!I live in a large home and received signal everywhere, except one side of my house on the lower floor (about as far from the router as you could get). Also, very weak signal at the front door. The Netgear Nighthawk was able to provide fair coverage to these areas, so I was disappointed my 7-year old Netgear Nighthawk R7000 provided better coverage than this brand-new ASUS RT-AX3000. To correct the coverage issue, I used a WiFi extender in that hallway near the front of the house (D-Link range extender, WiFi 5, nothing fancy). This now provides coverage to the far side of the house, but it was a bit surprising the ASUS didn't provide at least the same amount of coverage. I was expecting more for a brand-new router, as it had been 7 years since the last upgrade.CLOSING THOUGHTS: If your house is small (perhaps up to 1700 square feet/2-3 bedrooms/1 or 2 stories), this router may be powerful enough for you. Anything larger than that, and you may need to use a WiFi extender to help the router provide WiFi signal everywhere in the house. For larger homes, rather than try a router like this, it would probably be better to consider a Mesh system. I have been reading reviews and will likely try a Mesh system next time.I like ASUS - good company, great product, fantastic management interface/website to manage the router. Those things are way superior to the Netgear experience (which has less warranty and a terrible web interface, very slow and frustrating to use). So if this router has enough power for your house, I say give it a try.",
