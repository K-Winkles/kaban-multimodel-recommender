                "reviewText": "Easy to set up. Note: be careful with your cables as I apparently messed up one of mine and spent hours trying to connect to the internet thinking it was the router malfunctioning. I almost put the TP-Link back in the box to return until I reconnected my old router and it had the same problem. I tried a new cable and problem solved. So just be sure your cables are sturdy and in working order.Comes with: Router, one USB cable, power cord, quick start guide.On mine, there is the cable going from TP-Link router to my Spectrum modem. There is another cable going from my TP-Link to my ADT security modem. Yours may vary. Then there is the power cord. That\u2019s it for me, though there are 4 USB ports, I only need one.Relatively small. It\u2019s thinner than my old D-Link and Linkseys. Though you will need top room for the 3 antennae.The Tether App is free. There you can configure your wireless.WPA2/WPA3 NOTE! If you are looking to change from WPA2 to WPA3 then you need to log in to tplinkwifi dot net - there you will find the Wireless area in the Advanced tab to change from WPA2 to WPA3 - see above photo\u2014if you look for it in the Tether App you probably won\u2019t find it there. Using tplinkwifi . net takes you to where you can do more configuring of your router. So, again, go to that link, look for \u2018Wireless\u2019 and that will give you a dropdown menu where you will see WPS\u2014click on WPS and then click on the Advanced tab at the top of the page\u2014you\u2019ll see where to change your WPA status there. Save and you are done.Once you save the WPA2 to WPA3, your iPhone should not show that Weak Security message. Mine immediately went away once I saved the WPA3 in the TP-Link website I wrote above.For setup, I used the Quick-Start guide, but I also scanned the QR code to go to the Tether App. Really, for me, a combination of the Quick Start guide, the APP, and going to the link above did the trick. All three of these allowed me to familiarize myself with what the router will do.My old workhorse laptop does seem to be loading things faster. My old D-Link router was pretty old so replacing it has given me more speed. As well, I have more wireless devices pulling on my router so this TP-Link will be great for that.My iPhone 8Plus and my old iPad Air 2 immediately recognized and connected. As well, my old laptop recognized and connected, immediately. Zero problems. My Samsung Smart TV recognized the TP-Link immediately as well. My Smart Watch, etc. All seem to be working great.As for customer service\u2014well, not as good as I\u2019d like but not awful. Don\u2019t try to call as you will only be frustrated. An email got me a response within about 24-36 hours\u2014not good if you want instant help. So a chat session netted me an answer to my question very quickly; however, I got lucky and only 2 people were ahead of me, but when I\u2019d tried the night before there were 22 people ahead of me\u2014lawd!They do have a \u2018community\u2019 where you can look for your question, but you have to dig around in there. There\u2019s a FAQ page as well, but again, you have to dig.Despite the customer service being a little difficult, I\u2019m super happy I took the plunge with the TP-Link. I\u2019ve had Netgear (many years ago), Linkseys, and D-Link and while those were fine, this one just may be my favorite as far as how easy it was to set up, the APP experience, etc.NOTE: Don\u2019t forget to look for firmware updates. These, if any, are located in the Tether App\u2014look under \u2018Tools\u2019 and then scroll down to \u2018System\u2019 and there you will see \u2018Firmware Update\u2019 - there you will see if you need to do an update.In the App you can also do Parental Controls but I don\u2019t need that. You can create a Guest Network. There\u2019s diagnostics in there. And etc.One cool thing is you can set you LED lights (under LED Control) to go off at night. This would be great if you have your router in a room where you don\u2019t want to see the lights. My lights are hidden from me at night, but I still use it and it works.And, if all you want to do is have a router for wireless and not do anything else, you can do that.I\u2019m quite pleased with it. I highly recommend.Thank you for reading; hope it helps with your decision!, Kathryn.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this router to replace a TP-Link Archer C7 (AC1750), having bought two of those for use in a couple of different applications. The C7 worked great for over five years, and was OK for its original use--a few computers in a relatively small space. As we got to a bigger space, it struggled a little bit to get to the edges (basement, upstairs bedroom at the other side of the house, etc.). Everything I read seemed to suggest that I needed a mesh system but I didn't want to spend the money. Found this model in a review of mesh systems, which noted that \"maybe you don't really need all that hardware...\"--so I thought I'd give it a shot.Setup was all of ten minutes, but I'll offer two caveats here. First, I'm a geek (by background, not by trade, but still...), so I do this stuff all the time. I don't really know how complicated it is for a first-timer. If you haven't set up your own wifi in the past, call your family geek and get him or her to help out. Most of us work cheap when it's family! Second, my old router was the same brand. I used the same SSIDs (network names) for the two main radios, so I didn't have to go around resetting 22 devices. Again, I can't say how practical that will be for others' applications, but it sure made my setup easier, especially on devices like Roku where you have to put in the password with a remote control...Now to the important stuff. In the past I had a 100/10Mbps connection from Spectrum and the older router could handle it fine. In the same room, connected to the 5GHz network, using a modern laptop, I could get all of 120Mbps download speed. On a 2.4 connection I could get something in the 60s under those conditions. But as I got farther from the router, and especially on older machines, I'd get 20Mbps down--and the 5GHz network wouldn't even reach the upstairs bedrooms. With this new router, I'm getting over 450Mbps throughput on both SpeedTest.net and Google speed tests. At the margins (upstairs bedrooms and basement), I'm still getting at least 200. (I can't address why I'm getting over 400 when I'm only paying for 200--don't tell the cable guy!)Seriously, if you're considering mesh wifi, but don't want to get into the cost and setup, try this router first. It's been quite a remarkable change around here.",

                "reviewText": "I was initially having issues with a modem/router combo from my service provider with constant wifi disconnections and signal loss. After spending over two hours on two occasions trying to resolve the issues, I finally decided to ditch the wifi part of the modem and just get a dedicated router. And I'm really glad I got this particular model from TP-LINK.Setup was a breeze with being able to set up in less than 5 minutes. Using their web interface, it's easy to get online and to set up the wifi details. With the TP-LINK account and the tether app on Android it's even possible to connect to the router anywhere to make sure it's working. You are also able to see all devices on your network and to allow or deny access to any specific device. You can also designate devices for priority service.Regarding speed and range, this router is able to send a strong signal up to the second floor of a house. With the beamforming technology the router targets the specific device to send signal to it when needed giving you the speed and extended range.Need I say more, the design is also very sleek with status lights across the front and you can schedule the lights to turn off at nights if it bothers you. You also have the option of a scheduled reboot time which is recommended if you have more than a few devices connected. The reboots help solve any speed issues if you have any.All in all, it's such a great router and I'm relieved I got it and don't have to rely on the modem/router combo from my service provider. Great buy.",

                "reviewText": "Reason for buying the AC1900 was to boost my home network wifi signal, and it works perfectly using their 5Ghz frequency. I connected the AC1900 to my telco's router - my telco provides a 75Gb download speed, and when using NordVPN - it drops to and average speed of ~40Gb on my devices including Android TVs for streaming videos. On occasion it may go up to 60Gb using wifi and depending which location I connect the VPN - I get 80Gb without VPN on wired devices, . The AC1900 boosts my internal wifi speed to over 100Gb with VPN active - that's over double the speed. Make sure you activate the MIMO feature when on the 5Ghz frequency- this product is strongly recommended if you want to increase your home networks' wifi download speed - their was no increase in the upload speed or on wired (ethernet) devices.",
