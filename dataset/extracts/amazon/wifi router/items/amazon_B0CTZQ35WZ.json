I gave this little device a try because it looked easy to use..just plug it in.....and it works. Well, a little configuration was needed but the set up was so easy! The instructions are well written and there is even a video you can watch. I liked it so much I bought a second one. I learned that you need a little more configuration if you place two on your network, but also discovered this little device does more than just WiFi extending. It can be you primary WiFi Access Point by just plugging it into your Internet Modem. I highly recommend this product and suggest you try it out. Why spend hundreds at other stores....Its right here, just plug it in,.",
