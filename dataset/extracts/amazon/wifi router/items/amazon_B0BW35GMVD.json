                "reviewText": "This is pretty good mount, but it needs better management for the cables. The power cord from the router sticks out and bumps into the the mount the way it is designed. They could also add some kind of stem to the recessed area for the excess cord so it doesn't constantly try and fall out as you try and get the router placed, plugged in, and secured all in one step. Seems silly. But honestly once you have it up and all is good, it looks great and functions just as you would expect. Having my router mounted much higher has also improved my wifi signal coverage.",
