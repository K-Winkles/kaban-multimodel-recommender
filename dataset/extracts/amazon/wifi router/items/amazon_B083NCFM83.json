                "reviewText": "Got this to wall mount a couple of Nest WiFi's.Looks - It looks exactly as pictured. It is not necessarily the most elegant looking thing, but it is clean looking and suitable for most places. If you look at the pics, you will see around the bottom side there is a gap, that is where the cord wraps around. It would look a bit more elegant if it did not have that gap, but for me it was fine. One thing, the two mounting screws are black, whereas it would have looked better if they were white. You can always paint the heads or put whiteout on them if this bothers you.Installation - They provided the screws and anchors (if you need them). I was able to install by just screwing them in. I used a level after the first one was in and had no trouble getting this mounted on the wall nicely.Cord management - It is not obvious from the pics, but the cord gets wrapped around the gap by the bottom. To get the best results I unplugged from the outlet, plugged the Nest Wifi in, and then wrapped and finally pulled the cord back to the outlet. This let me get the tightest fit I can. There was for both points some extra wire, so that is kind of sitting there behind the unit and is not noticeable. All-in-all, a suitable solution.Fit - The Nest Wifi fits into it perfectly.Other than that, not much to say. Does what I needed, looks fine (especially after putting some white-out on the screw heads), and seems sturdy.Would recommend for anyone looking for a wall mount for the Nest Wifi.",
