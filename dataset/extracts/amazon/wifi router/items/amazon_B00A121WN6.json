                "reviewText": "I decided to change my wireless home camera set up to wired. Well, my router only has 4x 1Gbps LAN ports and I have my PC + 5 cameras at the moment.I wanted to just turn Wi-Fi off. I mean, Wi-Fi cams are so easy to hack. I've hacked my own and got my credentials + password.So, after having more and more neighbors move in nearby (ughhh), and knowing that I could see everything about their wireless networks, (I am a computer tech guy, I'm not naming software, but I can see who has Ring door bells, smart appliances, cameras and which routers they go to and which extenders are on that LAN).I didn't want anyone seeing me. So, wired, here I come.I have an 8 foot ( I think ) Cat8 (don't ask haha, family member had one) Ethernet cable going from my PC to router. That's port 1. Then I have port 2 going from my router to the TP-Link TL-SG108 8 Port Gigabit Switch. I bought it over the 5 port because... why not? The price was there to just go for the 8 port imo. Plus, I'm gonna fill it up eventually. Then I have the other two 1Gbps ports on my router going out to a camera.Then I have 3x cameras connected to the TL-SG108 Switch. So, so far, 4x connections. 1 from the router, 3x from cameras.Ping to cameras are still <1ms, just like the ones connected directly to the router. I'm using several 30ft and a 50ft Cat 7 ethernet cables from Amazon Basics. They work perfectly.My motherboard has 2.5Gbps Ethernet, so I would have liked to have went with a 2.5Gbps switch, but then I'd also need a 2.5Gbps Ethernet router... so yeah..1Gbps it is. Plus, it was way cheaper, anyways. I can't believe how cheap it is. It feels SOLID. Heavy for its size. That is ALWAYS a positive sign in the electronics world. Light electronics are cheaply made. This is not cheap. It doesn't even get warm to the touch.I'm excited and looking for more cameras to add to it haha.Oh, and yes, it's literally plug and play. It's as if all you're doing is adding more ports to your router. There is no other set up involved. To see the devices connected to the switch, you go to your router's admin page as normal.Zero set up other than plugging in the power adapter into it and then the wall. Then just plug your ethernet cable from your router to it. Now... any ethernet devices plugged into the switch will show up on your router and, as such, your home network. I'd buy more. I WANT 2.5Gbps so I'm ready to a 2.5Gbps router, but really, I'll probably have 10Gbps Ethernet on my motherboard by then.Ya can't keep up with the latest and greatest. Besides, my cameras don't come close at all to touching 1Gbps. I use H.264 encoding and they're older. For fun, I used \"jpeg\" encoding to hit 70Mbps, but it handled it fine. So I went back to H.264 and only run at 15Mbps combined speed.Update: I've now added another Ethernet cable to this TL-SG108 and plugged it into my Samsung SmartTV. Again, zero issues. It's handling everything I throw at it.110% satisfied with this purchase. If I'm not careful, I'm gonna fill up all 8 ports and have to buy another one haha. Good thing my router is also powerful enough to handle all this (DIR-878). It's nothing special, but it, too, is part of the equation in handling so much data coming through the Ethernet cable that's going to the TL-SG108.I'll stop here... because I'm pretty much saying \"I love it\" over and over. DEFINITELY recommend it or whichever model you need with the amount of ports you need. I'd recommend future-proofing and going with the 8-port over the 5 port since you will be down 1 port from the get go since you have to plug your router into it. The price is not much more and you don't want to regret not getting the 8 port over the 5 port.BUT that depends on your needs. You may need a 5 port on one side of your house and another 5 port on the other end, I dunno. That's why I went with the 8 port... and then got some 35ft and 50ft Cat7 cables from Amazon Basics.LOVE IT!",
