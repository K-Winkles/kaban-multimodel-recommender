I guess the TMHI router firmware can't handle long uptimes.I've had it for a month and am very happy with the performance. The one-time setup is a bit fiddly, so if you're not tech savvy, ask for help. You have to connect to the plug as if it were a separate WiFi network. I set mine to reboot every night at 4am, and check for connection every 2 minutes. All other settings I left as default.",

My daughter went to our winter home and it can\u2019t be set up without our phones/accounts there. Disappointed, hopefully in 4 months we can get it to work when we return.",

                "reviewText": "Very effective device and vital for anyone who needs to reboot their router to restore service. Instructions could be a little clearer in terms of the web based configuration, but even someone with little technical experience can figure it out. The default settings are a little too sensitive for my house, so I ran it a few days to optimize just how sensitive it should be before rebooting. The first day it was plugged in, it rebooted my router during a Zoom conference, so you may need to adjust it so that it really needs multiple outages for long periods before it reboot. Regardless, I\u2019m far less worried about my router locking up and my cameras being inaccessible when I\u2019m away from home. Get one today!",

A lot of times, I can\u2019t access my security cameras/thermostat remotely because my wifi is acting up. But nothing I can do since I\u2019m not home to reboot my router. I just came across this device which I didn\u2019t know even existed!! It reboots my router automatically and I can even set it to reboot on schedule. You can also have it notify you by text or email when it does a reboot. and it\u2019s easy to install. I haven\u2019t had it that long but it\u2019s working very well. There is an older version of this device which I think is oversized. I got the newer one which is smaller and more compact. It does not block the other outlets. At $50, it is a little pricey though. And if you want their online cloud service, that\u2019s another $25 a year. I wish the $50 includes one year of cloud service. Other than that, it\u2019s a great product!! Will post updates if anything changes",

It dutifully does so, then sends me a text message.Setup was quick using the app. There is an upsell for some extra features, but you really don't need them.Simple as that!",

In the last 2 weeks my home lost internet 5 times, this device reset my Bell modem and everything was up and running in minutes. I no longer have rely on friends and family to reset my modems, when I\u2019m away. I have one internet rebooter at each location, I now have confidence both location will have a stable internet connection. Great product.",

If you want to test the unit to see if it works, do NOT change the default settings. If you set a check time other than 5 minutes, it does not work. This minor problem has been solved in the new firmware. My unit came with firmware KeepConnect_KCMINI_4M_V3_Rev2 and I upgraded it to the latest KeepConnectVPN_KCMINI_4M_V4_Rev1. You need to send an email to support to get the link for the new firmware.I tested it several times and it worked each time.You can also have it programmed to reset your modem once a day, every 2nd day, every 3rd day etc... I have not tested that part, as I don't need to do this, but I don't see why it would not work.It is also much smaller than their former model which is a plus.Overall I do recommend this little unit: it does what it is supposed to do!",
