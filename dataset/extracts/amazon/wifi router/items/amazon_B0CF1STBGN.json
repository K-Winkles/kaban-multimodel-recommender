                "reviewText": "This mount holds the router onto the wall neatly, while giving it enough room away from the wall to breathe and circulate air.With the Starlink router's vertical design, I really like having it wall-mounted, knowing I won't bump into it and knock it over by accident. This mount keeps it nice and tidy, off your desk or other surfaces.It's made from injection-molded ABS, which is a lot nicer looking and probably stronger than some of the 3d printed options. It is strong enough to hold the weight of the router.The arm and base clips grip the router securely, allowing you to place it into the base confidently. The clips barely round over the router base and side, so the mount itself is very subtle and barely noticeable once the router is installed.You will need to disconnect the power and data cable temporarily in order to place the router into the mount. However, once it's mounted, if you ever need to disconnect the cables, it's easy to unclip the router from the mount, pull it up to do your maintenance and then place it back.Having the two screw holes side-by-side is probably fine for most scenarios. The included screws and drywall anchors seem adequate to hold the weight of the router to drywall. The screw holes do accommodate other screws, such as drywall or similarly-sized galvanized decking screws, if you need to use those for your application or would rather use those.Having a little level handy will make for a neat installation.",

Highly recommended!!",
