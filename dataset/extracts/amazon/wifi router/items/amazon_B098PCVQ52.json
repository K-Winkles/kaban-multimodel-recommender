                "reviewText": "It came promptly but had a headache to activate with Xfinity. Their reps chat thru the apps.The first one told me to return it to Amazon, as it is still tethered to an old account at Comcast.Last night another rep said he would try adding to my account and he apprised me he did. Today morning another rep gave me a heads-up that it is still tied to an old account. Frustrated I asked the rep to connect me to the manager, she then activated it under my account and untethered. Still, the internet did not work. After countless hours with advanced tech support, they were able to activate it. Still, the bandwidth comes out to be 68MB download on a 200MB account.I called the ARRIS help desk, and they were nice but told me if the cable is connected and ethernet is connected with the desktop and it is taking me to Xfinity activation,the burden lies at Xfinity to activate, which they ultimately did.It's working at half the bandwidth at 3 different speed tests. Spent around 8 hours . Kindly watch out with service providers if it is connected with old accounts.The seller should be responsible for a return.",

                "reviewText": "Oh wow what a mess this thing is. First problem I had was the ac adapter it came with was defective, I am using an extra I had lying around, knowing a thing or two about volts and amps helped. It came to me not reset as well, there is a reset button that is not labeled, pressed it with a sim key and it reset. Thank goodness I have a networking degree because there is also no instructions included. To start, read the label on the bottom, connect to the wireless network your laptop finds, and then go to 192.168.0.1 in your web browser. NO additional apps are needed, I don't know what people are talking about. Once you've got your wifi all configured with a password and whatnot, now call your internet provider and yell at the automated system for an agent. Tell the agent you need to activate your modem and BAM! internet. Now for the disappointment, I have Xfinity with a 200mbps plan. Only the Ethernet ports run at that speed, the wifi only supports 40mbps down. I now do not use the wifi and have a dedicated wireless access point.",
