                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars FAST, simple setup, cheap mesh solution",
                "reviewText": "After doing a lot of comparison shopping, I ended up settling on the TP-Link Deco S4. My biggest factors were price, reliability, and range. I have a three floor 4500 sq/ft house built in 2003. The Verizon Fios Gateway router worked, but it suffered considerable slow down as I got to the extremes of the house. With the new three node Deco S4, I get full speed internet at every floor and extreme. Previously, I was able to get 100mb/s maxed out at the router with minimal traffic, but dropped down to 10 mb/s at the extremes of the house, especially the basement and some bedrooms. With one of these on each floor (main on middle), I range from 95-120 upload and download (paying for 100) on all three floors depending on time of day. Interestingly enough, I haven't suffered much dropoff in signal strength with each mesh node as opposed to the main wired unit acting as the router. I've read countless time that unless I'm using a wired backhaul that there would be signal dropoff at the mesh points, but I haven't witnessed any significant drop. I also purchased this system as it had ethernet ports for backhaul (if I needed to improve speed) and accesspoint use on each node, but I don't use any other than one at the main router for my Phillips hue bridge.The design is simple and clean. I was debating on saving $10 and getting the M4 (identical internals), but figured I was already scraping the barrel on price point so may as well get one that wasn't as much of an eye sore. These are clean, simple, modern, and much better to look at then the Fios provided router.The app is simple and intuitive and makes most of the decisions for you. It ran me through the setup very easily. It has parental controls and allows me to prioritize devices as well as setting up a guest network. However, what was most essential to me was the ability to turn off 2.4 or 5ghz signals if I needed to set up a product that only worked on one (usually older products that use 2.4 only). This app is mostly for people that have basic technical skills, but not full on IT networking knowledge.I chose to replace my Fios router entirely and run ethernet from the Verizon modem (optical network terminal) instead of coax so I didn't have to run the Fios router in bridge mode. I called Fios tech support and the person switched the feed to ethernet in five minutes. Now I don't have to rent my router and have much faster internet without relying on bridge mode. If you aren't comfortable with running ethernet and swapping it out at the ONT, you can use the Fios router and connect the Deco S4 to their router instead. This also allows you to keep your cable box functionality such as guide and on-demand without a MOCA adapter. I have no such plans as I'm dropping cable for YoutubeTV.On average, my house has around 40 connected devices from Phillips hue bridge/bulbs, Ecobee thermostat, Ring products, several Nest and Echo devices, five smart TVs, smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Don't buy into the hype that you need wifi 6e. This supports gigabit+ speeds and the dualband is more then enough to maximize efficiency. In addition, you can add or swap out mesh points to this system at any time from any Deco system (E3, M4, M5, P9, etc.). You can literally improve on this system in the future if desired. This was one of the best purchases I've made in a while.Update 2.4.21: I recently switched to 200mb/s from my ISP (it is the lowest package they offer when only purchasing internet). With this, I've noticed download speeds at the main router at 270-300 and 300+ upload depending on network traffic. I have seen more noticeable drop-off at the mesh points with this speed, usually 170-230 download and 200+ upload on my first mesh extension node, and 160-200 download on the one in the basement. I also have the biggest variance in upload speeds with this one at 45-120 upload, depending on time of day and network traffic. However this was also the location I had the biggest issue with previous to installing my Deco S4 system. In general, I am still getting amazing speeds, far exceeding what I'm supposedly paying for, extremely stable at every location of my house including the far extremes of my yard. I have can rely on blazing fast reliable internet throughout my house and not have to have wired backhaul to achieve it. However, I can now see why some individuals suffer noticeable drop-off with higher internet speeds at the mesh points. If you figure the drop-off as a percentage and multiply it times the speed, the difference will be more noticeable at the ghz speeds. Overall, love this device, how much faster my internet is and how I am not paying my ISP for their outdated routers they try to dish on unknowing consumers. Best purchase I've made in years.",

                "reviewText": "Despite the naysayers in the comment section and questions section, these work great with 2.4 ghz devices. First, you have to go to the advanced tab and disable 5 ghz and then connect your 2.4 ghz devices and then you can go back and reenable the 5ghz signal.These work really good. There seems to be a lot of interference in our house and so we bought two 3 packs even though it's only a 4 bedroom, 1 story home. That means we put 6 of these routers everywhere and overpowered whatever interference is plaguing this house. And now we have a super fast connection everywhere in the house. Even our outdoor wifi cameras have a solid connection. We're very pleased with it so far, although it's only been 24 hours since we installed them. But already you can feel the difference.The app is pretty cool, I guess, but the map on it doesn't really update where each device is connecting from as that devices moves throughout the house. You have to click on the room to see an update of device you're tracking throughout the house. But that's an insignificant issue that no one in the family cares about because no one is interested in tracking a device throughout the house.I'm an opinionated person who loves to complain and if something should change or these things stop working or something, I'll come back here and update my review promptly. Else, just assume all is working well.",
