Most other routers in the $30 and less price range have either one or the other, but not both. Decided to give this one a shot and it's working out well so far. The LAN ports are indeed gigabit speed and the wireless seems stable and covers the whole house. Never heard of or used anything by Netis before, but I'm pleased so far with its performance. If things change I will endeavor to update this review.Also, the router's default username and password are on the bottom of the router itself. This was not mentioned in the tiny instruction booklet that came with the router. Otherwise, installation was pretty smooth.UPDATE 2023: Router's still working fine! We finally got a streaming device set up and the Wi-Fi from this router is strong enough to stream 4K content no problem. IDK what the router market is like right now, but for $30 this still feels like a good deal.",
