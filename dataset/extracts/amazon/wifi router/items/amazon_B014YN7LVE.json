When we \"Link\" or \"Daisy Chain\" several of these together to provide WiFi coverage down in the Valleys surrounding our Mountain, We use a format like \"Our-Router_West1\" (\"The FIRST 'Daisy Chained' Western Netgear Extender, Connected to the MAIN Netgear Extender that covers the Western Part of the TOP of our Ranch, Which is Connected Directly to our Home's Router\"), \"Our-Router_West2\" (\"The SECOND Netgear Western Extender, which is Daisy-Chain-Connected to the FIRST Western Extender, Which is connected to the Main Western Netgear Extender, Which is connected to our Home's Router\" - That's a total of THREE Netgear Extenders, Covering the Western Areas Of Our Property, Up top, and down in the Western Valley) etc. etc...You start losing 'Throughput Speed' FAST when Daisy Chaining these units together, but at least you still have \"More than Decent\" WiFi Coverage, even (ESPECIALLY) in areas where Cell Coverage can be spotty (Like down in our Steep Valley to our North, Where our Natural Springs run, which is a pretty sheer 600 Foot Drop in Elevation, with only a few hundred feet of Width before Climbing UPWARD again to more of our property.. Cell Coverage down there is 'WISHFUL THINKING' at best, even with a Cell Tower Company Renting some space we don't use to place a Mini-Cell-Tower on our Property, so the Cell Companies can cut STRAIGHT ACROSS this HUGE Bowl of Mountains in the Area we live in, to provide Coverage to SEVERAL State Parks, WITHOUT having to run MULTIPLE towers on the Mountains that Surround us in the distance, 360 degrees.. Imagine a \"Pound Cake Bowl\"... The Edges of the Bowl would be the Mountains surrounding us in the distance, and the Plateau Sticking up in the center of the Bowl, is where WE live). Our iPhones will use \"WiFi\" to place calls, when they can't get Cell Coverage, so it works out GREAT for us!Recently, One of our Family Members built a home on land I gave them up here, about 900 \"Air Feet\" away from our house (So they don't have to see/hear us, and we don't have to see/hear them).. When I bought this mountain, NO Utility Company would TOUCH IT as far as \"Providing Lines this far from Their Main Lines\", So I had to buy all of the Power/Cable/Water/etc lines myself, and hire Contractors to run them all up here (Buried).. I sized ALL of the Utilities to be able to support 10 homes eventually, as our Children can afford to build up here once they are at a place in life where they can work from home if they wish, Or build a \"Vacation Home\" up here until they CAN live up here full time... I bought HUGE spools of BIG Fiber-Optic Cable Line from 'Corning', and had contractors run it a LONG way, to the Local Cable Company's Main Lines, that Carry Cable TV/Internet between Counties (Same for Power Lines, etc). So we have a LOT more High Speed Bandwidth than I need, Even working from home...Until our Family Member who just built a home here can afford to connect to our Main Fiber Line to get Cable Internet of their own, I bought Two more of these Netgear units, and Daisy-Chained them together toward their new house, which is East of ours. I Fully expected to need THREE Extenders to run 900 \"Air-Feet\", But TWO of them (One set in about the middle of one of our Upper Pastures, and the Second Unit Plugged into their Enclosed Screen-Room on their Back Porch) provides them with Decently fast WiFi Internet!!! We DO live WAY OUT in the middle of nowhere, without \"Other signals everywhere to shorten the range of the signals WE produce\" (for many different things), so YMMV if you live in a Suburb or something, but they work FLAWLESSLY up here for us.ALL of the FIRST \"Main\" Netgear Extenders are placed outside our home, in a Waterproof (But \"Signal Transparent\") Enclosure. Those First Extenders are simply used to grab the WiFi Signal from our Main Router inside our house (Going through \"THICK Stone Walls\" is TOUGH for even THE BEST WiFi Router!) and then \"Extend The WiFi Signal Out Across our Property\"... We have Four of these, Set North/South/East/West around the outside of our home, each about 50 Feet away from our Home.I've found it's easiest just to set up each unit by going to Netgear's site when you find the extender on your device, creating a login, and then you can change ALL of your Units from a Netgear Book-Mark TO EACH UNIT (You REALLY need to have a separate Netgear Bookmark for EACH extender!). From those bookmarks, You can rename each unit, set it's signal strength, see what's connected to it, AND how good the Signal Strength is, TO AND FROM, each unit, etc.I also found that if you just connect your iPhone (or whatever you may be carrying around) to EACH unit ONCE, let your device store that information, Then choose the option on your device to \"Connect Automatically To Known Networks (with better signal strength)\", Then we can walk, ride the Horses or ATVs, pretty much anywhere, and our iPhones switch from Extender Unit to Extender Unit without even hesitating! Our Devices connect to the Extenders with better Signal Strength as we travel around outside Seamlessly. We never even know when the device has swapped connections from one extender to another.Normally this is where I'd say, \"For the Price These Can't Be Beat'... But I've Paid MUCH MORE for WiFi Extenders that didn't perform HALF as well as these do! \"And For The Price\", you can scatter them everywhere over large areas.\"Tech Tip\": Lightly MIST the INSIDE of a clear \"Cake Platter\" CD/DVD Bulk Storage Dome with WHITE paint (To reflect the Sun's Heat AWAY from the Cake-Platter, and keep UV OFF the Extenders), Run an Outdoor-Rated Extension Cord through a hole in the bottom of the Cake Patter Storage Case (created when you cut the Center Spindle out of the base), Hot-Glue the Extension Cord in Place close to the bottom of the case, AND to close up the Gaps in the Bottom Hole to keep the bugs out, And you have a HIGHLY decent \"Outdoor, Weather Resistant, Signal Transparent, WiFi Signal Extender Dome\"I simply set up each new unit here in the house, log in to the Netgear Website, Choose which OTHER unit I want the NEW unit to connect to (either our Main Router, OR one of the Extenders out further from the house), and let the NetGear Site set it up for me (Bookmark the Netgear Site Associated with EACH INDIVIDUAL UNIT!).. Then I unplug the unit, take to where I need it, Plug it back in to Power, and it's good to go! Once we allow ALL of our Devices (iPhones, Palm-Tops, etc) to connect to each extender and save it as a \"known Network\", I turn OFF the \"Broadcast SSID\" Option, so no one else sees the (Now HUGE) WiFi Network \"Publicly\" (without Special Software, or a Signal Sniffer, etc).. But even if someone DID happen to somehow get onto our Property, past all of our Security Fences, and Security Systems, and find the WiFi Signal, well, that's what STRONG PASSWORDS, Encryption, And FIREWALLS are for! It can be a pain, but our Main Router is Set-Up to ONLY allow use by \"Devices We Specifically Allow\". \"Guests\" are allowed to connect to a \"GUEST ACCOUNT\", which puts them on a Secondary Network, so if their devices are Compromised, or have a Virus/Worm/etc, it can't propagate through to other devices on our Main Network. And if their devices contain a Keystroke logger, then whoever is reading the Logger's Output only has a Guest Password, WHICH CHANGES EVERY 10 DAYS, and Each Guest has a PERSONAL password that identifies THEM.. We do it that way so that if a Month from now, someone we don't know starts trying to hack into our network using an old Guest Password [Like: \"glenn-1s-C00l-0CT\"] that was used by a friend that visited recently, we know to contact THAT friend and tell them they've been compromised (\"glenn-1s-C00l-0CT\", LOOKS like, \"Glenn-Is-Cool-Oct\", But what it ACTUALLY tells US is \"It was \"Glenn\", \"First Part\" [1s] \"Of October\")... But even then Our Router wouldn't even respond to a MAC Address that's not CURRENTLY on the \"Guest List\" marked as \"Allowed\", so even someone Spoofing his MAC Address wouldn't work, since his Guest Access was COMPLETELY deleted the day he left.Probably 10 Times More than you Wanted to know, But nowadays Security Risks are VERY REAL, VERY possible, and that's even MORE of a Concern When you have WiFi COMPLETELY Covering Tens Of Acres. These are VERY useful Items!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Painfully basic and average. Works fine",
                "reviewText": "There is a lot to like about this extender but also some things that aren\u2019t so great. Where I am, the cable company offers free WiFi extenders that are smaller, better looking, and don\u2019t cover multiple plugs when you upgrade your internet speed. I didn\u2019t know this when I bought this and I likely wouldn\u2019t have had I known.This extender works fine. In my house I get 3 of 4 bars of WiFi signal on my phone and laptops in the bedrooms on the upper floor in the front of my house. This extender does a great job of boosting the signal in that portion of the house but it doesn\u2019t boost the signal nearly as far as I expected. Luckily I don\u2019t need it much further but one issue I have is that because the extender is second on the list of preferred routers on my phone I have to manually switch to it whenever I walk into those bedrooms to work and if the signal cuts out even for a minute then it switches back to the main WiFi router signal and I have to manually choose the booster signal again. I have this in an almost central location (about 2/3 of the way from the router to the rooms that need a boost) in my home so I expected that the signal would be strong not only in the rooms where a boost is needed but also on the other side of the repeater, closet to the original router. Strangely, just standing in between the main router and the Netgear extender will weaken the extenders signal and no matter how much you play with the antennae it doesn\u2019t seem to make a difference.Installation is a standard affair where you have to log into a special page for the router and connect it to your main router. There are security holes that remain open unless you are intentionally plugging them. Sure, the instructions tell you to change passwords and do certain things to secure the router but nothing forces you to secure your extender\u2019s network. As a programmer this is easy to do but it\u2019s not always easy for the average user. That said, the installation is typical and what I\u2019d expect from just about any range extender.The unit is bulky and blocks me from plugging in certain appliances in the same outlet as the extender. The antennas are ugly and seemingly useless. They do work but you have to be super patient, accurate, and once you get them in the right spot you\u2019re not going to see a huge difference in signal.Overall this is an average WiFi range extender. The market is full of these things and they all are underwhelming. I\u2019d choose this one over other brands because of the brand reputation but in reality it doesn\u2019t offer anything that most other extenders with the same feature set st the same price point wouldn\u2019t offer.",

                "reviewText": "Been using the extender for almost two weeks and it looks like the perfect purchase for my situation.My main router cannot be relocated since it's a fibrenet connection. Before buying this, I used to get speeds of 10-15 Mbps over WiFi (against my internet plan of 150 Mbps which is achieved by getting devices very close to the router or simply connecting to the router via LAN cable) in the room where I work. Getting a good connection and not reaping its benefits would be a bummer. That's when I did my research and came to buying this product; set it up the moment I received it.I was surprised to see the MRP on the label which stated Rs. 3500! But it's alright since I got mine for Rs. 1600 from SD Infotech.Inside the box were a quick start guide and the extender itself, nicely packed. Looking at pictures on the listing, no clarity regarding this in customer reviews, and travel adapters being listed under \"Frequently bought together\", I thought I'll be needing an adapter to convert the plug to fit the Indian socket, but to my surprise, the extender sported the Indian style plug by default. The extender has four lights - two big and two small - which change colors to indicate changes. The big lights indicate the signal strengths between the extender and main router, and the extender and wireless devices connected to it by changing colors - green (excellent), amber (good), red (poor). It also has a LAN port on the bottom side.Setting it up was easy and straightforward. The instructions to set it up are mentioned very clearly in the quick start guide. My router does not have a WPS button so I set it up using my laptop, which took about 3 minutes. Later, I set it up in the room where the signal was weak and the speeds were low, played with the position of the antennas, and voila! The speeds were up by a great margin - around 60 Mbps on WiFi and 95 Mbps via LAN. They're nowhere close to 150 Mbps but I believe this is the fastest it can get in this particular corner of the house.Overall, I am satisfied with the extender since it does what it's supposed to in the best way possible. 3 mobile phones and 2 TVs remain connected wirelessly, and one laptop via LAN, all at the same time and there is no noticeable drop in performance.",
