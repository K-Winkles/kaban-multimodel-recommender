                "reviewText": "I bought a Netgear XR500 last november for the very impressive looking DumaOS... to find a buggy, completely not fleshed out (event he VPN function advertised wasn\u2019t implemented until a late December firmware update), insanely unstable (crashed at least once a week every week, i had to resort to using my 4yr old Netgear R7000 that was perfectly reliable) router with the company that makes DumaOS having an incredibly apathetic, \u201cwe\u2019ll fix it when we fix it\u201d and \u201cNo ETA\u2019s on fixes, we make updates, Netgear releases them. Ask them\u201d tone on all forums, i gave up on hoping it would be fleshed out at any point soon. So i got rid of it for the AX88u and flashed Merlin on it.I was looking for a traffic analyzing, enterprise-functionality router with the XR500 with every nerd knob possible (like Tomato firmware offers), and got a dumbed down buggy experience with barely even basic configuration options. The AC88u was the exact opposite. From a conditional VPN to IPS/traffic analysis/web logging/firewal/features you normally need to outfit a network with separate dedicated devices for, this handles it all with absurd speed and responsiveness in the interface. Everything i thought might be a gimmick (like trendmicro\u2019s \u2018aiprotection\u2019) is the real deal and you could not ask for more to secure a home network unless you did go with those dedicated devices. It\u2019s super stable (i changed core router settings that have to restart services in AsusWRT, while transferring 150GB worth of data from a client to an SSD connected to it to test network/USB speeds, and downloading a giant BFV patch on my gaming PC while on a work skype call and never even got a blip of cut-out or noise on my call. The web interface locked up because i made one kinda dumb change while doing this but the call never did!), inSANELY fast across the board (from using it as an OpenVPN client to enabling all the COU-taxing security features to topping out its resources by reading and writing to a USB-connected SSD), i can\u2019t even convey how great this is.I wanted to see my clients\u2019 connection rates, which interfaces they were connected to, and very importantly their life bandwidth and traffic- and within a couple clicks i can do this as if i\u2019m navigating a Cisco ASA firewall. Just function after function, it\u2019s all available, and it all works.I also got this for increased theoretical AC speeds and eventual AX speeds, along with wanting the fastest chipset available (my R7000 nighthawk was extremely modular, but its dual-core 1ghz CPU definitely struggled to pass VPN traffic at full bandwidth. My XR500 bricked itself after about 5 minutes of use whenever i even tried to configure the VPN. The AX88U has zero issues with that speed or stability there). So far i haven\u2019t been able to bottleneck the CPU with anything yet without the ethernet Gb bandwidth limitation topping out first. Maybe when AX clients come into play and i set up an aggregated 2Gb link the router could start chugging in some cases, but i have no idea and really doubt it would cause a sweat at this point.Lordy, even gaming-wise i\u2019ve been casually checking my ping in Battlefield V and Anthem, i\u2019m getting response times i\u2019ve never seen anywhere i\u2019ve lived with any hardware i\u2019ve had before (7-12ms pings, better than 95% of everyone on any server i\u2019m put in).I even use this to manually reserve IP addresses for my non-configurable IoT devices so I know where everything is on the network. The XR500 would wipe its memory every few days, destroying the work i did there. This is super stable, leases every IP to every device i tell it on-call and never has an issue. It\u2019s just too freaking good. My R7000 was the king of the mid 20-teens. The AX88u is the successor.In summary this thing is an utter beast. If you\u2019re looking to go with a \u2018gaming\u2019 router, i was looking between this and the GT-AX11000 when i decided to get rid of the XR500. I chose this because they have the same horsepower, same specs, and the gimmicky 3rd band of 5Ghz the 11000 has id just that... a gimmick unless you have 300 devices in your home. I run about 50 clients in an apartment with plenty of neighbor networks and never have a problem with congestion or needing more bandwidth, especially for gaming, that this extra band \u2018gives\u2019 you. Also, the main reason i chose this is because the gaming ROG firmware on thr GT-AX11000 actually IS gimmicky. Read reviews on the GT-AC5300 and you\u2019ll see a lack of Asus updates, constant bugs, broken features (recently an update actually stopped that 3rd 5ghz band from even broadcasting), and poorly implemented gaming functions unique to the router that just don\u2019t work most of the time. I have a friend that runs an AiMesh with an AC88u and GT-AC5300 since Christmas and it has given nothing but issues. The worst part is, NO 3rd party firmware support with the ROG firmware. So if Asus doesn\u2019t fix a bug, you\u2019re out of luck. The AX88u is supported by Merlin which is the snappiest, slickest firmware out there for Asus routers. That\u2019s the key, the firmware- and the AX88u has the one you want with no big compromises to the AX11000.Last thing, AX11000 has the 2.5GbE port. Neat, but with the 8x 1GbE ports on the AX88u you have plenty of available ports to run link aggregation on, say, a separate switch with 2.5/5/10GbE support in the future for a 2Gb pipe into any of the direct router clients, while you can put any insanely fast clients on the switch directly later when those speeds start being adopted. It\u2019s all a win-win with this router and any future scenarios you can think of.10/10 best router of 2019, true Netgear Nighthawk R7000 successor.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the ASUS RT-AXE7800 Tri-band WiFi 6E Extendable Router, and I must say it is a powerful and reliable router that has met most of my expectations. I confidently rate it 4 out of 5 stars.The WiFi 6E technology has significantly improved my network's performance, delivering exceptional speed and stability throughout my 2,900 sq/ft home. The 6GHz band provides a seamless and lag-free wireless experience, making it ideal for various bandwidth-intensive tasks like 4K streaming and gaming.The 2.5G port is a notable feature that offers faster wired connections for devices that require higher data transfer rates, adding versatility to my network setup.While the router's performance is impressive, I did encounter an issue with its size. When the antennas are fully extended, it does not fit well on the network box in my new house. This has been a slight inconvenience, but thankfully, the signal coverage remains excellent despite this limitation.The subscription-free network security with Instant Guard and advanced parental controls provides peace of mind for safeguarding my home network and controlling internet access for different devices.Moreover, the built-in VPN functionality allows secure remote access, which is beneficial for managing my network when I'm away from home.The ASUS RT-AXE7800 is also AiMesh compatible, allowing me to expand my WiFi coverage with compatible ASUS routers, further enhancing the network's performance.In conclusion, the ASUS RT-AXE7800 Tri-band WiFi 6E Extendable Router is a powerful and feature-rich router that works great in my 2,900 sq/ft home. While its size may be a drawback for certain setups, its excellent signal coverage and robust performance have impressed me. If you're looking for a high-speed and reliable router with advanced features, this ASUS router is definitely worth considering.Sincerely,Mark",
