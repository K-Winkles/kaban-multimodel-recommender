                "reviewText": "Love this little bag! I'm VERY pleased with my purchase. The texture is SO soft. Almost like a real, believable quality leather with a hint of texture. Truly pretty. I wasn't necessarily looking for that, but WOW! I am seriously impressed. The size is absolutely PERFECT. I even searched local stores (and I have plenty in my area), and couldn't find one that appealed to me like this one. And what about the cost? Unbelievable. I'm telling you, this sweet bag could easily be mistaken for around $40+ or possibly a little more. Love the gold detailing. The interior is quite roomy, despite its smallness. Look at the photos. And you have EXTERIOR room too. You can easily fit your smart phone, some makeup, brush, comb, mirror, a few necessities like a pen and paper. You get the visual. And I like the nice strap. It's versatile so if you want it crossbody (like I do), you can do it. I'm plus size so you gals will have room in case you're wondering. Naturally you can shorten the strap or you can go strap free and use the bag as a clutch. But for me, I wanted the strap. I honestly can't say enough great things about this pretty and sophisticated little (but oh so versatile) bag. If you're thinking about getting it. Go for it! It's a little gem.",

They have multiple zippered pockets inside and out, which I found really convenient for separating lipstick, cash, my passport and other items. The purse is good quality, attractive, and the perfect size for travel. The price is very fair for the product you are getting. I intend to buy other colors and will use the purses for every day use, hiking, and travel. Practical and super cute!!",

                "reviewText": "I can't say enough about this crossbody bag. I'm 5 ft tall and heavy set and I was very skeptical for many reasons but decided to give it a try because I needed a bag right away for upcoming trips and did not want to carry my regular bag through the airports. I saw some of the reviews and hence the hesitation but I am glad I bought it. I purchased the bag July of 2021 and traveled 3 times after that. The pics above were taken today 11.4.21 after returning from my 3rd trip. I am submitting this review because I realized that after 3 trips ,and using this bag on a daily basis sometimes close to ripping, it is still pretty much intact. No rips, tears or missing or broken parts. Actually, I noticed I did not stopped using it even when returning home because it is so light and convenient. Not to mention that I love the leather and gold color. It went with everything I wore and it actually looks cute. Also, long enough strap to go across the body and be comfortable. Plenty pockets. Sometimes I overfilled it and was worried it would end up tearing or ripping somewhere buy it didn't. However, I tried to not do that too often and cause it to do so. It took what 3 trips could and did throw and it and it is still here (e.g., got caught on door handles and such often and it would pull). I think I'll keep using it here at home while it lasts. I would love to see this in a slightly larger size. Not much bigger than this just slightly and I'd buy it quick!",
