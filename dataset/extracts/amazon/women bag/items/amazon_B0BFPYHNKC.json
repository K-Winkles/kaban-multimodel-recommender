It's sturdier than I expected for the price, and the zippers are really high quality. It can fit my small laptop just fine with room for other items. The pocket on the side is not big enough for the type of water bottle I carry, but just to see, I checked and it is big enough for a typical bottled water. I am considering purchasing this again in another color, which is praise enough.",
