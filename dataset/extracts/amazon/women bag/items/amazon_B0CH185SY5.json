I have been carrying around a reuseable shopping bag for a hot minute, so in my mind I was expecting something around that size when I ordered the size Large. It is, however, very cute - the dividers are nice and were an unexpected feature. Though I can't quite fit everything I needed into this bag it was still worth it. 4/5",

                "reviewText": "I saw this bag and was so excited to have it come in considering the well written reviews, but there were a few things I think should be importantly noted before buying this bag. If you decide to use it as a a casual bag it's perfect. It definitely holds a good amount of stuff and even has dividers to make it easier for organizing. If you're going to use this as an everyday bag, like I intended to use it, I wouldn't suggest it. Even though it's a good size bag, it isn't as nearly as big as I thought it was going to be based on the picture, and I got the large! The dividers themselves are nice, but for some reason they don't reach all the way to the bottom of the bag? Which means if you have smaller items like chapstick or your keys, they'll just be rolling around on the bottom, rendering the dividers useless. The zipper on top doesn't zipper all the way, but I wouldn't say that's a big problem, but could definitely make it easier to lose smaller items. Overall good bag, just needs a few minor adjustments to make it better!",
