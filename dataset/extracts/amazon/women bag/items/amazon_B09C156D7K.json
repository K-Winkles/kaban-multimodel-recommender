                "reviewText": "I have the same design as this but it only holds a phone which I purchased so I could wear it on Disneyland rides. I needed something a bit larger to fit pads/tampons in on those times of months, so I purchased this larger one. I love that it has a horizontal design which makes it simpler to take my phone in and out of it and a separate front pouch to keep things organized. Only bummer is that the zipper going around the curves at the top can take some effort to get around, but I don\u2019t mind it. I bought one of these for my mom too as a Christmas present. Great price too! The original tags were listed at over $200.",
