Wear shoulder cross belt style (like the cool kids haha) for everyday use. Good quality material. Compact enough, you don't feel like you're wearing a full size bag but big enough you can carry all your essentials. Phone, sunglasses, cardholder wallet, chapstick, Lotion, mints, etc.Strap and buckle are heavy duty, bag material looks easy to wipe clean, zippers are solid quality as well.",

I was looking for something small, just for my phone and keys, and this is the smallest I've found, though ideally I'd like something smaller. It has a padded back, which gives it some shape and makes it more comfortable. The main downside is that the strap is too short to wear comfortably as a cross-body sling (and I'm short), so I can only wear it around my waist or hips. For the price, it's worth keeping.",

I live in a walking city and use this pack for quick jaunts and errands - basically whenever I don't need a full purse full of everything plus the kitchen sink. I can easily fit my phone, wallet, keys, sunglasses, and hand sanitizer, which are my basics. I also like that you can wear it a bunch of different ways, and it looks cute to boot!",

Other than that, it\u2019s pretty & will use in the winter under my outerware. Well made too. Would recommend.",
