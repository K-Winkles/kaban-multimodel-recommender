I love how many pieces each purse came with making it an amazing value. You cannot beat the price for these purses considering how well they are built and how many pieces you get.Pros:- So many colors to choose from!- Built as good as any other luxury brand I have used- Sturdy- Makes a great overnight bag, the big bag fits all my clothes for a night or two and then I use the next size down for my makeup- So many pieces to mix and match to your outfit- Came packaged securely with lots of padding, no defects when I openedCons- None yet, they work great!",

                "reviewText": "I was kind of skeptical about purchasing this set because of some of the reviews I had seen, but the good outweighed the bad and I went ahead and bought it! I\u2019m so glad I did. The tote purse is so roomy and can hold a lot. I have always been a bigger purse girl so this works out great especially if I need to hold extra things when I have all my kiddos. The smaller purse, the cross body, is super practical if it\u2019s just a small outing or just running a few errands and can still hold a good amount of stuff and is pretty roomy as well. Both purses offer outside zipper pockets as well as interior zipper pockets along with 2 open like pockets to hold small things like glasses or chapstick. Also the color and print are exactly like the picture and so pretty! The material is super soft and feels almost like genuine real leather. I already have a cow print wallet that works with this purse so I probably won\u2019t use the wallet. It\u2019s okay but only holds 8 cards and the zipper pocket for coins wasn\u2019t that sturdy but I won\u2019t use the wallet anyhow. The little card holder is practical but I don\u2019t have anywhere near that many cards so it\u2019ll probably just get stored.The only complaint I have is that there was a larger string kind of hanging off (pictured) but it didn\u2019t affect any of the straps. Also on the larger tote one of the handles was kind of scrunched up but I\u2019m sure after use it\u2019ll smooth out! Would definitely purchase this again or as a gift. Will most likely update after a few months and see how well it has held up!",

Pretty standard.I like to attach a shoulder strap to my tote bags and you can\u2019t do that with this bag - I thought there were loops at the base of the straps but they\u2019re just decorative.The zippers feel cheap are pretty garish to my taste. but i think very obvious zippers are the styleI don\u2019t think it was worth what I paid but I bought it for the blue/black color scheme so I\u2019m keeping it",

The delivery came quick, and I'm thrilled. The quality is acceptable for the price point, and the pop of colour livens up my usual outfits of black/white. The bags are youthful and classy looking, and I like that the biggest one is large enough to fit my laptop in for work, while the smaller handbag is nice to carry when I'm going out to socialise.",
