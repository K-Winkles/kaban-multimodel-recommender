                "reviewText": "This is a nice looking bag. The material has a nice woven feel and the outside zippers are of good quality, but I don't think the straps or bottom are leather - they look and feel like a tough vinyl. The straps have material on the underside which helps to keep the straps from slipping. The laptop compartment has padding only on one side, but it is spacious enough to use a laptop sleeve in the bag for added padding. There are plenty of compartments and dedicated spaces for organizing anything you might want to carry along. I will be using it as a work bag to carry 2 laptops, cell, work papers, and the stuff I'd normally have in a purse, because this one bag can hold it all yet doesn't look like a a suitcase. The USB port includes a long cord inside that you can connect to a power bank in the bag and then use the outside port to connect from USB to your device that you would want to connect outside the bag, such as while walking and using phone or to charge a device on a counter while remote/traveling. You can also use an adapter cable inside the bag to connect to a laptop that's not in use in the bag (or other item) and use the outside port to connect to a power source (such as at an airport or travel charging station) where you need to get a charge without getting all your items out of the bag. I can see this being very useful for travel and as a carry-on that allows you to fit plenty of stuff. If the straps and bottom were of better visual appeal, I would probably switch to use of this bag for daily use. But, I will definitely be using it for travel and times when I need to carry around 2 laptops. I think the price is a good value for what you get.",

It is waterproof which is extremely nice when you are dealing with computer equipment. It has pockets on the inside of the bag for anything extra that you want to locate in a hurry and also a zippered pocket on the outside of the bag. It is very convenient to place some of your items that you would normally carry in a separate handbag in this computer bag if you are traveling or going to some other location for work. It has a usb that is also built into this computer bag which you don\u2019t normally find in other computer bags. It is very versatile and durable enough to use everyday if necessary. This computer bag is made with good quality materials and should last longer than my current laptop. I would definitely recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "I got this bag for my wife to use as she travels for work.Besides padded pockets for a laptop and a tablet, there are two other zippered and one non-zippered internal pockets, plus a large central area for all the items that seem to gather in a woman's purse/bag.There is also one zippered pocket on the outside that would be good for travel documents/boarding passes etc, or even to put your phone away if you did not want to put it inside the bag.It does come with an external USB charging port. This is really just a USB extension cable that has been sewn into the bag. Neither my wife nor I understand the point of this since you have to connect it to a powerbank inside the bag, but there is then no pocket on the outside where a phone could be stored while is it connected to the cable. It seems for this feature to be more useful, the charging cable would exit through a pocket into which the phone could slide while connected to the charging cable. As it is, if you are charging the phone and not actually holding it, you would need to put it inside the bag and so you may as well just connect it directly to the powerbank inside. Having said that I do not think the USB Charging port detracts from the usefulness of the bag as a whole and others may find that feature helpful.The bag itself, seems to be well made and is attractive. The top zipper into the main compartment zips easily and is extended enough on both sides to allow the bag to fully open.The listing on Amazon does say that it is made of leather and canvas. It is hard to be sure, but I seriously doubt it is leather. I would say it is vinyl. However, for less than $30.00 I think this is a good buy.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a new laptop bag that could fit my 16-inch laptop but also looked stylish and professional. I decided to try the VANKEAN Laptop Tote Bag and am so glad I did!This bag exceeds my expectations. The main compartment easily fits my 15 inch laptop and the numerous pockets allow me to organize all my items and still find them easily. I love that one of the pockets is specifically designed for a water bottle. It fits my Stanley perfectly. The small zippered pockets on the front are perfect for keeping my keys, phone, and other small essentials within reach.The shoulder straps are wide and well-padded, making this bag comfortable to carry even when loaded up. I like that it has both a short handle and an adjustable, removable longer strap so I can switch up how I carry it. The USB charging port is very convenient for charging my devices on the go.The anti-water polyester fabric has proven to be durable and water-resistant. I got caught in a downpour between classes and my laptop and everything else inside stayed dry. The bag still looks as stylish as any name brand purse.For women who want a fashionable yet functional laptop bag, I highly recommend the VANKEAN Laptop Tote Bag! It has become my go-to bag for school, work and travel. An all-around great bag!",
