                "reviewText": "This is such a great size for those who don't carry much, but still need a gym bag. It easily fits a pair of shoes, towel, hydroflask, and blender bottle with a little extra room (enough for a light jacket). It can probably fit a weightlifting belt if you don't pack shoes. There's also a handy side pocket for your keys or wallet.",

It\u2019s my fault as I obviously didn\u2019t pay attention to the dimensions.Surprisingly, it actually fits my 5 year olds soccer gear perfectly (size 3 ball, cleats and shin guards) - even with room to spare. So for little kid sports it will work just fine. If I had realized how small it was before I purchased, I likely wouldn\u2019t have purchased at this price, though. I can\u2019t yet comment on how it holds up.",

Fits women's shoes size 7.5 well with the width of a cell phone left over. As I'm using this as an agility bag there's a mesh pocket on the outside for my dogs fetch toy and a small loop on the other side used for a caribeaner clip. Overall the bag seems of average quality. There is nothing enforcing the design (some bags will have a light rigid plastic like piece) so may be a tad slouchy. Overall happy with purchase.",
