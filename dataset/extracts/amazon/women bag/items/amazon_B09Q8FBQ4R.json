The shoes pack were sturdy and fit comfortable. Of course I was able to slid some regular flip flops, water shoes so bascially that is 7 shoes but those shoes were more thinner and went on top of the others. The strap came in handy. I was able to put the bag on my suitcase handle which came in clutch. The inside pocket was large enough to have cell phone charger, hand held fan changer and my fit bit charger, along with a pack of Extra chewing gum the large count. The additional mini bag I kept some extras in it. Great for some jewerly that would not get tangled up such as hoop earrings. Very durable and sturdy and fashionable. I could have used only that weekender for my trip to Barbados, but it was my first time traveling. I was able to take items from my suitcase to put in that bag and it saved me additional 75 bucks. LOL. A must have seriously!! Totally happy TRAVELER. Thank you to this company. Passed my test for sure.",

You don't have to check this bag, perfectly can travel with you as a carry-on bag. The additional small bags are also very useful, you can use them as a small purse while traveling.This color, cream, got a little bit dirty, but it was very easy to clean.We certainly recommend this bag, you won't regret it if you purchase it. We also purchased it in faux brown leather, this option is better because it doesn't get dirty.",
