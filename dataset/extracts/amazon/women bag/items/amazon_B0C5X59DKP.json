                "reviewText": "I was looking for a cute gym bag because the old backpack that I was taking was falling apart and was impractical. I decided to try out this bag for the price and the look.Pros:- The shoe pocket is great. I store my climbing shoes in there and the air hole allows for the shoes to breathe.- The outside zipper pocket is a nice touch and all the zippers are metal rather than plastic- This bag is very lightweight and could easily be folded downCons:- The strap slides a little too easily so sometimes the length of it changes when I go to put on the bag or take it off- The bag strap attachments are just plastic rather than metal which probably means at some point they will break- It would have been nice to have just one inside pocket- The material is a bit more flimsy than I was expecting so the bag doesn't hold it shape as advertised. It sags quite a bit moreOverall, I just needed a gym bag and this will do the trick. I am trying to buy more items that will last a long time and unfortunately I'm concerned that this won't last for more than a few years. For now, it is convenient and I like how much storage room is in the large pocket, as well as the separate area for shoes.",
