But they were all too small, had no pockets or compartments to store anything extra, and overall would\u2019ve been just another bag to have to carry to work. I hate the idea of carrying more than one bag (especially during the winter when you\u2019re also carrying a coat all over the place.)So, there are lunchboxes that look like purses\u2026 and then I found this ACTUAL PURSE that HAS A LUNCHBOX COMPARTMENT\u2026 but it\u2019s A PURSE! It FITS THINGS! It has POCKETS ON THE INSIDE! And it\u2019s huge! And can carry my laptop! Like what else can I even want from it? This is the ultimate all-in-one purse!I hadn\u2019t noticed from the pictures that it came with a strap for it to be a crossbody too - that was a game changer for me and a nice surprise when I opened the package!The quality seems good, the bag is very stylish, and it has a lot of space whether you\u2019re using the lunchbox compartment or not. It also fits my computer perfectly which I LOVE! So now I\u2019m able to carry all of my food (this tote fits a good amount!), my chargers, my computer, my makeup and more, ALL IN ON BAG!It was very well packaged, and it even came with a storage bag with the brand\u2019s logo so you can store it nicely in the closet and protect it while you\u2019re not using it, just like luxury brands do. Very nice.This is perfect. I absolutely love it!",

                "reviewText": "THIS BAG IS FREAKING INCREDIBLE! a lunch box IN your purse? AMAZING! I absolutely LOVE that it has a little shelf you can velcro to the opposite side of the purse inside to keep stuff from sitting directly on top of the lunch box portion. I have a Microsoft pro with an expandable file folder that I can slide into the pocket with tons of space for bigger laptops if needed. ORRR keep stuff separated from the main compartment when im not carrying my laptop. The side pockets are perfect for my Chapstick, gum, pens, etc. And it comes with a very decent sized bag/clutch/whatever the heck you want to call it. I'm a simple small wallet person but always have to have my Chapstick, keys, gum with me. This holds it plenty well with room to spare if I wanted to carry along some makeup too. NOW THIS LUNCH BOX WILL COLLAPSE AND GO OFF TO THE SIDE IF YOU JUST WANT TO USE THE WHOLE PURSE! Did I know that? I don't think so when I ordered but let me tell you.... I WAS SHOOKETH TO MY CORE in the best way! This bag is PERFECT FOR MY NEEDS. WHICH is literally an every day for ALL THE THINGS! work? Yup. Day trip? No problem! Son's all day wrestling tournament? GOT ROOM FOR THAT! we always load up on snacks to take to stay away from concessions. My husband wanted to take his leftover pizza for the tournament today. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: THAT IS A WHOLE LARGE HANDTOSSED PIZZA IN THERE! To take with. To eat WHENEVER! Along with my pb&j sandwich, baby carrots, 2 small bags of cashews, and FOUR FREAKIMG CUTIES. I could've put more and I almost wanted to but gotta keep my figure so I had to tone down my new purse excitement.THIS IS THEEEEE BAG! You want this. You will be so excited when it gets delivered that you run home on your lunch break just to get it and start using it immediately. You will ALSO walk around your entire place of employment to show it off and make everyone so super jealous that they haven't found this FREAKING GEM first. You'll even make your male boss ooo & aaaah over it just to make sure everyone is well aware that it is a big deal and BRILLIANT to HAVE A LURSE! which is what I called it. Lunch purse.But really, get this. Freaking. Get. This. BEST PURCHASE EVER! I'm officially a ONE BAG FOR ALL THE THINGS wife/mom/everything. Forrrrrget about a bag and a lunch box. WHAT. A. TIME. TO. BE. ALIVE.",
