The design ensures that the items are securely held in place and that there are numerous configurations for storing different items. The bag is sturdy, but not too heavy, and it folds up nicely, even when full. The large size is too big for just carry-on style traveling, unless you are just heading out on a short trip. I will probably buy the next size down for longer trips when I am traveling light. Quite impressed with this item.",

I am beyond happy with my choice!! This bag is such an improvement! I love the look and feel of this bag! The material is waterproof and has a very soft feel to it! I chose the black bag and it has a very classy look to it!! I love that the bag itself zips up and all of the separate compartments in the bag zip up as well!! I was able to comfortably fit so many items in this bag! I highly recommend this toiletry bag! Great for travel and everyday use as well!l. Also, a great way to get and stay organized!",

I like that it can be hung up saving on counter space which is often limited in hotel bathrooms. Packs well, and seems durable after 5 uses so far this year.",

The bag itself is nice and can fit a lot, but I was disappointed with being unable to really zip it up. In the future I plan on buying a larger bag and use the medium bag for less items.It is a nice bag for sure though!! But if you have bulky items like contact solution I'd go with the large.",

The zippers work very easily and the bag will expand enough that I can squeeze more things in. But most of the time I don't overfill it and it lays pretty flat in my suitcase. The con is that the elastic straps in the compartments aren't easy for me to use (could be my fingers!) but generally I organize items so they hold each other straight. I recently purchased a second bag and plan to use it for miscellaneous items I like to take along.",

Before, I would have two separate bags that I kept my makeup in and then another one for skin care, toothpaste etc. This holds a ton and the quilted outside likely will wipe clean fine if/when that is needed. I got the large....just sent my daughter the medium and I think the medium would have been plenty big enough for me as well. It folds in to itself nicely and the hanging hook makes it great for outside the shower, then over to the sink/mirror for make up. Totally worth the money and would make a great gift as well, esp for someone traveling or going off to college.",

I haven't tried cleaning it, but looks decent. Hopefully if needed shouldn't be a problem. Sturdier than I expected for something off Amazon. Pleased and would recommend.",
