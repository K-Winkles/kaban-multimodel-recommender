You can fit a lot of stuff in here aside from your wallet such as a book, water bottle, snacks, and even a set of yarn and needles. The straps themselves were a bit concerning as they looked so thin but they've held up pretty well for the past few months. The three snap closures on the bag were also a nice touch and make it feel more secure. However, the lining inside the bag has begun to come undone and fray a bit but doesn't seem like it will affect the integrity of the bag in the long run. Overall it is a solid tote for casual, everyday use.",

The middle button is magnetic and the 2 smaller side ones click into place. Very secure!! Great quality and packaged nicely. I LOVE IT and might get more colors. Keep in mind when ordering make sure to choose the more expensive version of the bag you want if you want the same size I got!! It\u2019s super big!!",

                "reviewText": "I like this bag, it\u2019s a simple cute colour and is quite bigger than I thought. I hold quite a good amount of stuff in it and there are two pickets inside which I was surprised to have, considering the price of this item. I would have given more stars but there is something off about the cut of the top part of the bag so the straps, which I would say are a medium length, the straps feel a bit off and the bag itself ends up sitting just a tad too high. It\u2019s not terrible but it feels a bit awkward. It does the trick for what I use it for but if you need to walk around with a bag, comfortably for hours, with it sitting on your shoulder, this is not the bag for that. If you\u2019re going in the car for short stints and want to carry extra bags for your groceries and you other stuff, then this is the bag for you. The colour matched the pic quite well too.",
