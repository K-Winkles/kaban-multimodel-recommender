I wanted an easy to pack bag, with pockets inside and deep pockets outside for water bottles. This one came folded up and seemed really thick for packing. Once I unfolded it I didn't care about the thickness anymore. It can be packed open and flat. Better quality fabric - good strong zippers and deep pockets. Just a little larger than an average shoulder bag. It will be packed open, perfect in the car, and folded for storage at home.",

I was so pleasantly surprised with the quality of the bag for such a low price! (looks more expensive) I`m using this instead of my ($125.00) CalPak as a Carry-on . Holds everything I need to have access to on a flight. It also folds up easily although a little bulky because the material is thicker but still a great option. I`m very happy with this bag.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ll be returning the bag. I should have been clued in to the notification that says this is a high return item. It was inexpensive and I see why. It is especially frumpy and crumpled looking. The muted rose tone does not match what was expected from the product description. All pockets, except one, are on the outside of the bag, not good for safeguarding my items at the gym. The pocket inside doesn\u2019t zip closed either. There is one zippered pocket on the outside though. Straps are a good length that I can just throw it over my shoulder. Exterior pockets are also deep. The size of this bag also isn\u2019t great, once my sneakers are in it most of the space is taken up and then when I put my street clothes in it it\u2019s over flowing and can\u2019t be closed comfortably (my clothes aren\u2019t particularly large either size 8-10). Material feels water resistant. So there are positives and negatives.",

It'll easily be a good bag for the gym or for work with my 1L waterbottle, lunchbox, laptop, etc. It fits so much!\u25aa\ufe0e i love all the pockets it has. It has like 4 on the outside and 1 inside.\u25aa\ufe0e water resistant, which is a must in canada\u25aa\ufe0e it feels very durable and like it's made of good qualitycons:\u25aa\ufe0e the only con i can think of is that it is definitely way less lavendar than it looks on here. I tried getting a photo to show, but it's not showing up properly. But it's def a muted down lavendar, which i was a little sad about.\u25aa\ufe0e it comes folded up which made it quite wrinkly. But i think it goes away.I absolutely love this bag \ud83d\udcab thank you!",
