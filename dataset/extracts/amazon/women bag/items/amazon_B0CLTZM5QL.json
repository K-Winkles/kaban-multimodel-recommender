I like the sage-green color and that the strap is made from the same fabric as the bag for a low-key look. The stitching on the bag is neat and consistent and the zippers all work well.

I think it is a wee bit smaller than it appears in the description photos but that is no problem whatsoever as it holds a tremendous amount, I fit a whole (larger than twin size) fluffy blanket in it for the photos!The zippers are all \u201cquality\u201d and it is VERY well-made, not a stitch or seam out of place. Inside has three side-by-side mesh pockets, one waterproof zippered pocket and one regular zippered pocket. The exterior has the pocket for possibly shoes or wet items at one end. It has a fixed strap for carrying it on your shoulder and an adjustable strap for carrying it cross body.Bottom line:I am impressed with this bag and looking forward to using it, I love the clean lines and think that the color makes it look even sharper. I wholeheartedly recommend this purchase :)",

                "reviewText": "I use this as an over night bag and it works great. It has different zippers and compartments that help me separate stuff and organize it a little better than if it was just a simple bag with no mesh insides or zippers to separate things in it. Light weight, nice sage green color that works for men and women, and also it has an adjustable strap on it that\u2019s easier to carry. Light weight too.",
