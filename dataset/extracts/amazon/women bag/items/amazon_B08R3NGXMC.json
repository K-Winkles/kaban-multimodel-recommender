Everything about it looks classy.... the beautiful rich emerald colour, the gold zippers, the leather material and the design \ud83d\udc4c my laptop size is 14.5 and it fits perfectly. Along with the handles it comes with a extended strap. It is light but sturdy, it feels secure and durable which brings me comfort. It is definitely water resistance because of the leather material. It has different sections on the inside where you can store other items like chargers, pens, books etc. Perfect for school/business.",

                "reviewText": "This bag is sleek, stylish, and fits everything I need for my workday, so I don't even need a purse. The handles and hardware are sturdy and adjustable. The shoulder strap is redundant for me, since I just sling the two handles over my shoulder, but it is detachable and adjustable as well, and has a nylon lining on the shoulder side for comfort when carrying. There is a decent sized laptop/tablet pocket (15\" w x 10\" h x 1.5\" d) with an elastic strap that keeps everything secured and attaches to the velcro on the outer side of the pocket. My laptop is 14-15\" and fits fine. There is a smaller slim pocket within the strap for the laptop pocket (11\" w x 7\" h, no depth to speak of). I don't use it for much, but I will never complain about more pockets.Next there is a huge (16\" w x 10.5\" h x 2\" d) space for cords, accessories, notebooks, etc, and includes a mesh pocket on each side.As if that weren't enough storage space, there is an inner zipper pocket in the middle (12\" w x 9\" h). I like to put the items that would normally go in my purse in this compartment so I can zip it up and keep it out of sight.Finally, there is another open space (14\" w x 9-10\" h) with a wall pocket (two of these are about 3.5\" w x 5\" d, then there are two individual pen slots) for pens, marker, highlighters, calculators, chewing gum, whatever, and another zipper pocket (7\" w x 6-6.5\" d), in case you were running out of places to put everything you own.There are no outside pockets, which is fine, because see above, and it keeps the sleek look in tact. I have a cute little matching skinny scarf tied to one of the handle ends to give it a little something extra, but it really doesn't need that touch to make it super cute and fun to carry.Five stars was a no-brainer.",

                "reviewText": "This is a decent work tote with lots of pockets and space for my laptop and notebook and some other small items. It is a bit narrow, so you can\u2019t stuff it full, but it holds everything I need it to. I love that top can be zipped closed. The handles are large enough to fit comfortably over the shoulder, and the longer strap is a nice option as well. The color is gorgeous and this is a nice work tote that can easily transfer to errands afterwards without looking out of place. It did come out of the package with a weird smell that lasted into the next day, but it wasn\u2019t too overpowering (but definitely noticeable up close).",

                "reviewText": "I am in love with this bag. I carry probably more than I should in my work bag and lately the bags I try fall apart in a matter of months- the last one barely made it half a year. The straps usually just tear off. I carry: a waterbottle, laptop, book, planner, assorted papers, small electronics kit, a snack, and a few odds and ends.This bag comfortable holds it ALL and the straps don't show any strain. I especially love that it had to water bottle pockets on the inside - they don't get in the way if you don't use them. The bag had the perfect amount of organization with 1 middle zip section that divides the whole thing in half, and a small zip section on the front side for my keys, wallet, and phone.And I LOVE how it looks. The plastic was a little tricky to remove from the handles (they were really focused on protecting it in shipping), but it came with no scratches, wrinkles, marks or other.",
