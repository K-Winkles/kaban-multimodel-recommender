The color is true to the pictures.I'm also very impressed with the quality of the bag-- it is much sturdier than other ones I've tried from Amazon. Zippers are metal and not flimsy, good stitching on seams and straps, and the fabric feels water repellent. I really love the D ring on the strap as its perfect for hanging the bag.Front pocket is larger then expected, think phone+wallet+etc. Flap 'pocket' isn't secure and things fall out so I don't use it. Main pocket is decent size. Inner sleeve fits an A5 journal or thin book.",

There are quite a few compartments as well as two outside mesh pockets that will hold a bottle of water, a small umbrella, a toothbrush and toothpaste, some tissues, anything you might need to grab real quick. There are other compartments that will hold a tablet, a book, papers, etc. You can easily also fit a wallet and other stuff you might need quickly while you travel, like makeup, jewelry, or passport. It carries comfortably and you can hold it in front of you so you feel a little more secure that somebody isn't going to grab it off your back. It has a low profile (not bulky like a backpack) and is lightweight and sturdy. I bought another one as a gift for somebody else and they lovef it.",

                "reviewText": "Estaba buscando una mochila que fuera practica para cargar mi switch. Me gusto mucho, se ve de buena calidad, parece si es inpermeable y resiste el agua como lluvia y entonces no se moja lo de adentro. Tiene una sola asa y puedes decidir si moverla para brazo izquierdo o derecho. Me parece que es antirobo, seg\u00fan entiendo, tiene ese clip, en caso que alguien te abra tu mochila mientras caminas escuchas el sonido del clip y eso te advierte que te estan abriendo la mochila, creo a eso se refiere lo de antirrobo. Yo la uso para cargar mi switch, si cargas una tablet tiene que ser un ipad mini, no caben tantas cosas, asi como las fotos que estoy poniendo, metiendo mi switch, la base del switch, un joycon extra en una funda, la funda de los cartuchos, y una extension de cable, y ya esta relativamente llena, quizas ahi caben unas llaves, o una bolsa ecologica adicional. No hay tanto espacio, pero se me hace super practica.Mi \u00fanica queja, al repeler el agua, el asa es muy resbalosa, si te lo colocas en un solo hombro, se resbala y se cae, la \u00fanica forma de asegurar que no se caiga es metiendo la cabeza y que el asa quede cruzada en la espalda. Bolsa muy recomendable.",
