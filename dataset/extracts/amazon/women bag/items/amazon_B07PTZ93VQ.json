                "reviewText": "Bought this bag back in October 2019. At the time I owned a OnePlus One cellphone and it fit perfectly in both big zipper compartments. I used the bag with the long strap it came with and adjusted that to a length that was best for me. Hardly ever had use for the short strap (which still looks brand new to this day). The bag hasn't degraded one bit, the zippers still open and close perfectly. I easily fit my ID and a few cards (I don't have many) in the slots of both pockets. Depending on what I decided to carry with me, I sometimes switched where I kept the cards. Yes the compartments are slim, but they're meant to be since it's a minimalist type bag. If they opened out a slight bit wider that would have made the bag even better sure (hence the 4-stars for versatility) but I'm satisfied with the space. A mirror, comb, lip balm/lipstick/lip gloss fit comfortably in the pockets (literally any size e.g. full sized Mac lipsticks, ColourPop liquid lipsticks, PMG lip minis etc.). When I used blotting sheets, a pack of those fit easily as well. In the small front pocket, I keep my hand sanitizer, or sometimes a lip balm or mini lipstick if I use the larger compartments for something else. I also had those soft cloths to clean my phone screen and sunglasses at one point in the back compartment. I eventually swapped out the long strap for a gold chain strap I had from an old bag and I love how it looks. It's 2022 now and obviously I've been going out way less than I used to when I first got the bag, but it's held up extremely well over the past 3 years, with only very slight wear beginning to show at the curve of the bottom edge of the front pocket. All in all, it's a sturdy little bag that served me well and went everywhere with me when I had places to go. A worthy purchase imo, and for the price you really can't go wrong.",

My only complaint if that the brown purses pull tag of the zipper broke off. The zipper still works, but it\u2019s too awkward trying to zip it. It was pass the return date, so my bf is going to try and see if he can do anything. I went ahead and got a burgundy one until/if he fixes it.",

                "reviewText": "I have a few of thesr types of bag in a smaller size but get frustrated as I cannot fot both my keys and glasses in at the same time so decided to try this larger one. The size is great, can fit all my cards, phone, keys and glasses in (without case)All 3 pockets have zips so nothing can fall out. It's lightweight to have across the shoulder. Pretty good quality and the colour is exactly the same red as the photo.The only thing that I think it might be able to improve on is having more of an open pocket to slip phone in and out as I find it annoying to have to unzip it but this definitely gives it better security and this is probably only because I'm used to the smaller ones with that feature.Would order again in a different colour. Also really like the smaller strap that it comes with as this would be nice for a carry bag rather than across shoulder",
