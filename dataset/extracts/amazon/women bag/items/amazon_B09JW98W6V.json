I then purchased two bags in different colors and could not wait for them to arrive. When they did, I was extremely pleased with the excellent quality and beauty of the bags. I only have a picture of the cream/brown bag. The other bag is the pink/brown one, but I do not have it with me at the time of this review. The price was also a plus for me-that's why I purchased two. Overall, I love both of these bags and have already warned my husband there will be more coming!",

                "reviewText": "1st of all I just got this purse & started using it right away. There's pros & cons as most things these days do have some kind of flaw(s) here & there. It's not all bad & not all good but I believe in both kind of reviews so here goes. It's just like the picture so that's good & it's a good size not overpoweringly big & not too heavy. It's very well made so far & I never overload my purses if anything I downsize for simplicity & the divider pocket is really the best thing as its deep & as wide as the purse which is an awesome thing. The lining is silky & stitched good. It did come in a flat box as another reviewer said. But when u take it out of the bag covered box all u do is put your hand inside & start molding & pushing the bottom into place (pretty cool way to do it & that's a pro part) anyway the disappointing part is the top closing zipper. That's a vital part & should of been made w/a metal zipper (like w/bluejeans) cuz it's pretty durable till u get to the edge about 2 inches I'd say from the end of the zipper where the zipper starts (if that's not confusing) & it snags. If u don't want it to snag u gotta stop almost to the end. I'll deal w/it for now but I have my wedding anniversary & birthday coming up so I'll find something else but for now it'll do. The chains aren't heavy & where they connect onto the purse look well made the other zippers are in good condition so far. The color is good. It's not real wide & I don't put alot in my purse but I have to stand my wallet & checkbooks straight up inside so it can close but that works for me for space. I don't regret buying it but I regret that top closing zipper. That's the disappointing part. I'm pretty sure it's a bit waterproof from drizzle. Came overnighted w/out the extra cost. Overall it's a good purse. Update: in regards to the top closing zipper I found that if I don't zip it all the way to the end I won't encounter that snag area & it zips open easily without snagging & opening & crossing is super easy without any hindrances & snags & another cool part is u can open it wide to get into it & so now it's become the perfect purse (so far that is) so I updated my info so there's no issues. Recommend it if a person can do it this way if u have the top closing zipper issue. Would be great if it's a metal zipper tho but I made it work for me.",

It will look nice with any outfit be it work or for a casual look - even down to joggers. It has clever pockets. The outside pocket is great for keys..gives easy access. The inside as seen in the picture has a nice center pocket. You could carry an Ipad in the center. I'd say the design is just as clever as a brand name bag...pockets n all. I look forward to using this bag! It comes off well made, the stitching is tight and neat. The lining feels sturdy and thick. I can't recommend based on use as I just got it today. However, with just how pretty it is and the feel of it -I recommend this bag!",
