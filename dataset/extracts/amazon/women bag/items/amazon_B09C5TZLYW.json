                "reviewText": "I stood and looked about the darkened parking lot, my breath hitching in my throat. One second, two, three, and then four until I forcibly shook myself, reminding me to breathe. I summoned my courage and ran to my car. I gasped in stunned relief and did a little dance outside my drivers door in excitement! No broken windows, no stolen wallet, no stolen purse! This fanny pack literally saved my life from another round of hearth ache and misfortune.I purchased this Fanny pack after my purse and other items were stolen from my car, outside of the gym I belong to. Normally I would have locked my things inside a locker in the gym but those also had recently been broken into. This Fanny pack is awesome. Not only do I not worry about going to the gym in the early hours of the morning anymore, I also longer have to worry about leaving things behind because it literally is attached to my hips! It has 3 very spacious compartments where I store my iPhone, charger, drivers license, pens, chapstick, debit/credit cards, cash, and remote to my garage. I love it! My only criticism of this Fanny pack is that the zippers can be a little stiff and difficult to slide open and closed at times. The zipper to the back compartment also malfunctioned at one point and when I zipped it closed the teeth at the other end opened. However, after fiddling with it for a moment, it corrected itself and hasn\u2019t happened since.If you have a problem with leaving things behind or have had the misfortune of having your things stolen and having to protect yourself from identity theft and the whole 9 yards because of it, purchase this. You will not regret it!",
