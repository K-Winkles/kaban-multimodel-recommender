There's so many generous size pockets, and dividers inside this bag and some outside as well. The straps are comfortable for wearing over the shoulder or just carried by hand. It's so nice, just to reach in and retrieve whatever items a person needs. Before, when using my regular large purse, everything migrated to the center and buried up like a big ball of confusion. I, can, in all honesty, highly recommend this Tote. There will be no regrets because it offers such versatility and style. I'm going to buy a few more of these as gifts for the ladies in my family. Kudos to Amazon for listing such a high quality, yet affordable, bag.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely LOVE this bag! I bought it specifically for a work trip where I was flying across the country and needed something that could act as my \"personal item\" on the plane and as a laptop bag at a conference. For the price, I wasn't expecting a whole lot. Wow! This bag is gorgeous! It held up beautifully for my trip and looked super professional at the conference. Once back, I've continued to use this bag daily for my commute to work. It holds so much stuff and keeps everything organized. I love the turquoise liner, the quilted look, and the very sturdy straps. I almost want to get a backup bag now, as I know this one will last for years and I want to be certain to have the same bag again. I've had bad luck where my favorite items are discontinued years later. Either way, I LOVE this bag!",

                "reviewText": "Update: bought the bag a second time, and I was absolutely in love with it\u2026 until I realized the bag didn\u2019t look nearly as wide. The padding in the bottom of the bag is either looped/rolled or otherwise bunched up. The button of the bag isn\u2019t flat, if I hadn\u2019t already taken off all the tags and kept the bag I would have returned it. New purchase was black quilt pattern, old one was basic blue pattern.I needed a bag u could use as both a carry on (lots of space), as well as a purse (easily portable). This bag fulfilled both needs beautifully.It\u2019s durable. I stuffed this bag to the max on flight days. It can easily hold a folder, sweatshirt, makeup bag, chargers and cables, water bottle, wallet, keys, and another small cosmetic bag.The purse has multiple pockets to easily desperate and help find things, there\u2019s a built in sub port on the outside, so you can charge while your bag is zipped. The handles are shockingly durable for how thin they are, but they\u2019re tick enough to be comfortable to carry.While at my destination, this bag also served as my daily use purse. When emotes, the purse is rather compact. It expands nicely, but it compresses just AS nicely.After 3 international trips, I\u2019m finally purchasing a replacement bag. The straps are just now starting to pull away from the purse. It\u2019s still useable, but since it works so well I figured I\u2019d buy a second one while they\u2019re still available.For anyone that wants a large bag with organization, and functional features (including the amazing water resistant material, makes cleaning the bag so easy), I couldn\u2019t recommend this bag any more highly.",
