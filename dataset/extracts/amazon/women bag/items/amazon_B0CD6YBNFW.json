The lining feels nice and thick and the exterior is soft and pleasant to touch. I was looking for a leather purse and the price of this one was really low for leather. There has been some debate about the purse being real leather. I figured I would take a chance and order it. Ultimately the purse was NOT leather. The tag actually says it is polyurethane. I left a photo of the bag and the tag along with it just for proof since everyone seems to be debating about it.",

                "reviewText": "I have only used my purse for about four days, but looks like it will be as good as most of my purses. Sturdiness and durability are difficult to rate in four days. I really like all the pockets. It would have been nice to have one on the outside end of the purse to hold water bottles.I have a complaint about ordering on your website. Several colors of this purse were on sale. A bright green one was included in that. I wanted that purse. But every time I entered it in green, it priced that one at full price, which was ten dollars more. So I chose another color. Oh, that green was beautiful!",

                "reviewText": "I have 2 of these purses. One in grey I\u2019ve had for a year and recently the same in purple. The purses are soft, well-made and attractive with lots of pockets. Like one of the raters previously noted, the description says it\u2019s made of \u201cwashed leather\u201d and it appears to be leather, however the tag on the newest one says the outer part is PU, not leather. I\u2019ve had no trouble with the first purse freezing hard during very cold days (Minnesota). Hopefully the new one won\u2019t either. The \u201cMontana West\u201d has changed from a small discrete metal logo on the back last years model to a now larger plastic (cheap-looking) logo which I hope doesn\u2019t catch on things. As I said, I really do love this soft less structured purse!",

The lining, however, is super thin and loose fitting and definitely won't stand up to keys, pens, or anything even remotely sharp.
