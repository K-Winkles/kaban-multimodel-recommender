I have only used this bag for one trip so far, but I'm so pleased with the quality, particularly at this price. I packed enough clothes to last me 4-5 days with no issues, and was also able to easily fit a book, a large travel mug, etc without expanding the bag. Would have easily fit my laptop if I wanted. The bag felt really light and comfortable to carry. Way easier and less bulky than a duffel. It didn't take much overhead bin space, and I imagine it could fit underneath the seat. Will attempt the next time I fly.One reviewer did mention it bulges in the middle due to strap placement on the sides. It's a minor issue. I imagine if you pack a certain way, you can minimize the bulge. It's not a good enough reason for me to deter recommending this bag, which I highly do.",

                "reviewText": "This pack was perfect. I used it for a 2 week backpack journey through Europe and it held up amazingly. The zippers felt strong throughout despite me overpacking it slightly. Shoulder straps were comfortable enough so that when walking miles between towns it was still not painful on my shoulders. The simple design with its external pockets kept things organized and easy to access. The secret compartment at the lower back area kept my passport and valuables safe and secured so I didn\u2019t have to stress. I was searching for a pack that could compare with the more expensive options and this well surpassed my expectations. I would buy again or recommend, after my short trip in Europe the pack still looks and feels brand new and will be used for future trips. It\u2019s also the perfect size for carry on luggage on any plane train or automobile so that was nice knowing i could bring it anywhere. Also felt very comfortable riding a bike or scooter with the pack on.",

                "reviewText": "This is a preliminary review after getting the backpack out of the shipping box.The backpack was in a plastic bag that was of a heavier material than I normally see for such a lightweight item. It was a resealable bag that they thought to also tape across the resealable portion of the plastic bag to keep it from popping open during shipment, I'm guessing. What got me was they even taped the bottom two corners of the bag to make them form to the lines of the backpack packed inside. Who does this?OK, enough with the plastic bag. Reviewers have commented on the pro and cons. I'm usually concerned with the cons. What comments I remembered was it was thin, floppy (no structure?), had and had no bottle carrier. What I was expecting was a nylon sack with a bunch of zippers and straps. What I found was modestly padded bag that had no form BUT, it was also just unwrapped and and nothing inside it to give any form. After stuffing it with clothing, towels, etc, the shape began to form into what I expected it to look like. Compartments are good sized and well protected. As for the bottle holder, I can always get a bottle carrier with a velcro strap that has a ring on the other end to sling along a bottle. This is a combo suitcase/backpack. It's not going to be perfect for everyone, not at this price. The padding on the straps are better than expected. They won't rival anything from REI, Northface or Patagonia but then again, I'm not paying $75-250 for this above base level bag either. What else, no off putting gases when opened up. Looks pretty good, to me.Cons so far (for me) are the cinch straps. I wish there was one in the middle of the case. After cinching down the top/bottom straps, I was left with a bulging \"belly\" about the middle of the case. When putting the case away, it would be nice if a couple of the straps could do double duty and hold the case together when folded up for storage. A minor thing.I'll be putting this to wok in a few weeks, IF I remember, I'll update this post with any new observations I come across.",

The backpack straps stow in the back and don\u2019t get tangled or caught on stuff and are quickly available and comfortable to use when you need them to have both hands free. The size has been good for me on trips up to a month, but on longer trips I will take another small bag. The zippers have been strong and no problems the handles on top and side are strong and comfortable to use and again I find the size bigger than it looks",

                "reviewText": "Needed a durable, yet reasonably priced, bag for a trip to Costa Rica that would fit inside Spirit's personal item bin. Assuming you are filing it with clothing for a typical trip, this 40L bag worked perfectly (had to squeeze it a bit and you can't use the expansion zipper). I've used it for a couple of international trips since and it's been great. There is no separate laptop compartment, which saves space if you don't need to bring your laptop. Most bags seem to have this compartment. It doesn't have some of the fancier features on more expensive bags (that increase weight), but overall this has been a great travel bag for my needs!",

I'm not a frequent flyer and hadn't been on a plane for years, since before 911 so, I hadnt really experience all the ins and outs of airline travel since the security changes. This case served me well. Lots of pockets and zippers to compartmentalize my belongings. It can be a back pack or a duffle bag. Whoever designed this knew what they were doing. I highly recommend this product if you're OK not having something on wheels for your travel case.",
