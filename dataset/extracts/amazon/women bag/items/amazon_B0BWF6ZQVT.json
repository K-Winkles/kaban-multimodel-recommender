                "reviewText": "I never had the need for a laptop carrier because I didn't carry my laptop out of the house. I bought a very expensive laptop and in the last 6 months I have traveled a few times and carried my laptop wrapped in a towel in a backpack. I wasn't comfortable with it but needed to bring it with me. After my last trip I decided to purchase a carrier. I first purchased one that fit it perfectly but it wasn't cute and when I ordered it I didn't take in account that I needed to carry my laptop cooler as well. There wasn't room for anything besides the laptop. I returned it and searched for a tote bag specifically. I found this beauty! I got the maroon and black bag and I LOVE it!!! It fits my laptop, the cooler, and all of my cords with some room for a couple of other things. It's also extremely durable. I don't mind the weight of it probably because I never carried one for comparison. I don't know how I lived without it. Did I mention it's beautiful? Lol. I would buy again but hopefully that time is far far away.",

Sometimes I don't feel like carrying my backpack to my workplace especially when I have meetings. I don't want to leave my backpack inside my car because I fear a break in (it happened before and they took my laptop \ud83d\ude2d) Thus, this bag looks more professional whenever I have classes before or after work. My laptop fits perfectly! Books, makeup , pens , wallet etc. It is very big and lots of pockets. It is very stylish and elegant as well. It comes with a little purse which I plan to use it as a makeup bag.",

Zipper closure is great! Large pouch inside, two snap closures outside, I just love it. I get so many compliments! It comes with two different lengths of straps, and an external USB port. Surpassed my expectations. The itty bitty gem was just a nice touch that really made me smile when I found it (but it popped off the first day--quick fix though)!If you are looking at it, get it.
