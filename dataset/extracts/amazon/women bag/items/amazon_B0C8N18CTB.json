                "reviewText": "I knew this wasn't a huge lunch bag, but it's also terribly small in the wrong places. For example, good luck sticking a thermos in the side mesh pockets. The pockets won't come up even halfway, so your thermos will fall out the minute you throw the shoulder strap on. Thermos or not, if you put ANY drink in the side mesh pocket, there's not enough mesh, so a bottle or can will push into the internal space, limiting the overall carrying space for items placed inside. Ridiculous.Love the appearance, but NOT a practical lunch bag in most instances.",
