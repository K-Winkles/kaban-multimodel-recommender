                "reviewText": "I bought my bag about a year ago, and it's my number one go-to bag for pretty much EVERYTHING: work meetings, beach trips, weekend outings, as a gym bag, and of course the day to day use. As a writer and student I carry a laptop, journals, notebooks, small textbooks, pencil case, charging cable case, wallet, water bottle, etc around at all times. Sometimes I also carry my lunch, or even extra clothes. Somehow, it all fits... snugly, but fits nonetheless! I have a small laptop and it fits perfectly--that is, of course, if I don't zip it. I cram this bag to the brim almost daily as I live in a city, commute everywhere all the time and rarely have the chance to go home. Full disclosure: it would just barely zip over my laptop's case, but after one too many times of me forcing the zipper when it obviously didn't want to go, I busted it (totally my own fault--the laptop case was simply too big). Before then, though, the zipper was perfect, and set my mind at ease during crowded train rides since nobody could just reach in. I travel all the time, it's the perfect size to put behind my legs on a bus or in my lap on a train. A small umbrella or thin water bottle (I have tall glass 18oz and short glass 10oz bottles) will fit the pockets, but the pockets also make a good home for sunglasses. The color I got (yellow) has begun to fade throughout constant use, sun bleaching, cleaning up coffee spills or other stains, etc. It may not be as vibrant after a year of such hard use, but the color is still pretty all the same! It is now a light yellow, and looks like it'll eventually fade to become pastel yellow. Lastly, this bag is STURDY. I wasn't entirely sure it would be since it was only $20, but let me tell you, I have put this bag through the ringer. Other than the zipper (which was totally my own fault), all the seams are still perfectly strong, the straps are still secure and comfortable even when the bag is heavy, and all in all, except for the color fade, this bag is pretty much structurally the same as when I bought it.I would give this bag 11/10 stars. I don't often rate things, but this bag is fantastic and if you want a light, sturdy, messenger bag, this one is it!!!",

It\u2019s a sturdy canvas bag, good long strap for cross body wear and handles too, if you want to carry it. It\u2019s big enough for my huge journal, a decent size pencil case, my water bottle (32 oz) and the pocket inside easily holds necessities like a wallet, pill case, lip balm, etc. it has two side pockets which I don\u2019t really use, but they\u2019re deep and functional and I would wager whatever you put in wouldn\u2019t easily come out. I love this bag.",

                "reviewText": "This tote is well made and serves its purpose. It has 2 side pockets than can hold 16oz water bottles. But, when using the side pockets with water bottles, it makes the tote slightly narrower in width. I bought this for my music carry all. It will hold a 1\u201d 3 ring binder, a large wallet, a hair crush and several more softbound music books. One downfall, the zipper is recessed and placed lower from the top, so I am unable to zip the totes shut when carrying my music books and notebook. Also, there is an inside pocket with no zipper, most things placed in that pocket are not secure. I like the bag and the yellow color. I will keep it and use it for day trips as it holds my iPad and I can still zip the bag closed, even with a water bottle on each side . Well worth the money, but not suitable for notebooks if you want to zip the bag shut.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had and used this bag every day for 4 months.It does not carry an exceptional amount of items, but it fits exactly what I carry everyday. One notebook, my iPad, my kindle, my keys, my wallet and a medium sized pencil bag.If you carry textbooks everyday, I would consider a different bag. While the bag won\u2019t rip on you and probably would fit 1-2, textbooks are much too heavy to carry on one shoulder. The thick strap helps with weight distribution, but textbooks are too heavy nonetheless.If you carry a very large laptop everyday, I would consider a different bag. My Hp Omen gaming laptop is taller than the bag, making it impossible to zip closed, however my ipad pro fits easily. It is still comfortable enough to carry my laptop for a short time, despite it sticking out.This bag is made of a decently thick material with sturdy stitching, allowing me to carry heavy items (like my laptop) without being worried it will rip or fall apart. Though I only carry my laptop occasionally as I said before, carrying a lot will hurt your shoulder.The bag easily adjusts to a shoulder or cross body bag, additionally it\u2019s very stylish. The zipper is well made and sturdy. The straps are thick and have not frayed after heavy use. The bag is a thick material but is NOT waterproof. I leave the bag at home when it is raining.Overall, this bag is absolutely perfect for a student who carries small, lightweight supplies.",

I washed it in cold and then hung it to dry. The color didn't fade. The material of the bag feels thick and durable. The strap length is great, it is long enough for me (a large person) to wear comfortably as a cross body bag. But it's easy to shorten, if needed. Overall, I'm really happy with this purchase.",
