                "reviewText": "I use this product every day to bring my personal belongings and work equipment with me everyday. Small and low profile enough that it fits in a small cube locker, yet large enough to fit most of my daily work needs. You can stuff a pretty decent sized book in there with plenty of space of box cutters, a phone and other small tools you might need.The bag comes with a USB-A extension, allowing you to carry a small power bank to charger your phone (phone cable not included). While I personally have not had the need for this feature, it\u2019s a welcome inclusion to the bag as you never know when you might need a quick charge.The bag is semi-waterproof, though I wouldn\u2019t suggest long exposure to heavy rain. I live in a rainy climate area and occasionally get soaked in water. But have yet to have a single drop penetrate the bag (my books have always stayed completely dry).The metal zippers are great quality. I zip and unzip the bag many times per day, and have been using this for months with no signs of wear or tear.My only grip is that the shoulder strap is very limited in the adjustment capabilities. I\u2019m not the tallest or biggest person, and the shoulder strap makes for the bag to hang a bit lower than I\u2019d have wanted, but (to me) this is such a trivial issue that I would still give the product 4/5 stars.Great product and highly recommend for anyone who needs a subtle and non-flashy bag that is small enough to fit in a small locker.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this to use on an overseas trip. I wanted something I could have my hands/eyes on at all times versus a cross body purse, backpack, or other type of purse. This has 2 main pockets that fit A LOT of stuff (one has an additional zipped pocket), along with a front zipped small pocket, front open pocket, and a back zipped compartment. With so many compartments, I was able to keep all of my things organized and secure. I was never needing an additional pocket. The quality is excellent - I definitely tested it's structural integrity and it delivered. What was additionally convenient is for pictures, I could easily sling it backward so that all you saw was a strap, and then sling it back in place in front of me without having to remove it. I will use this for every overseas trip in the future!",

                "reviewText": "Before purchasing this bag, I did lots of searching for the perfect bag to carry everything I needed when I go places and travel, all including my kindle, and finally decided on this one. The design is very simple, more of a casual wear bag for every day use. It fit everything I needed to carry without looking too bulky. All black material, with a kind of rain coat, water resistant type of material, and all black zippers. I did not have any issues with the zippers, and when I have walked through the rain, I did not have any issues with water getting in. I did however have an issue with the straps. If you like to wear your bag in the front, which I prefer, you can only wear it crossing over your right shoulder because of the permanent placement of the straps, unless you swing it around to wear on your back. And if you are like me and have broad shoulders and like to carry a lot of things in your bag, it is definitely NOT COMFORTABLE. The strap tends to slide up to my neck and rub and burn while wearing it. Also, the strap links are square and tend to turn on it's side when using it. I would have to do A LOT of readjusting when I wore it.As much as I liked this bag and it was very affordable for what I was looking for, the biggest and worst part was the comfort of it, or the lack there of. Unfortunately I decided to return it and purchase a different bag under a different brand. Comfort over style for me, and this was NOT IT!",
