It is lined and made from canvas so you know it will hold out to a little wear and tear. The inside has divider pockets and one deep zipper pocket to help keep things organized. Very happy with this bag!",

I hope this one lasts longer. It's quite durable and seems to be made well. Im happy with how much it can hold. It's quite sizable. There are plenty of smaller travel bags out there. For this size, this bag was the best option I found. I recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I LOVE this bag!First, I have to give a disclaimer... I have a weird obsession with bags. But, that should also let you know how great this bag is because I go through a lot of bags and there are few that I feel the need to rave about.I use Ikea bags regularly because I love how big and sturdy they are. I use them for everything and bring them everywhere. But... they're bright blue, plastic-ish bags. So I was looking for an alternative that would hold a lot of stuff that I could carry here and there. I read the reviews and thought I would check this one out. And, the photos were quite impressive of someone carrying this monstrous thing.When I opened the package I felt this wave of disappointment thinking, \"This isn't nearly as big as it looked.\" But when I took it out, opened it up, and put some stuff in it... wow! It's huge! Then I realized that not only was it huge, but it's really well made. It seems really sturdy, it's canvas, which I really like, and I'm already absolutely loving it and planning on how I'm going to start parting with my 30+ Ikea bags that are all over my house. I plan to buy a couple more of these, so I can keep one in the car and one at my office for comfort reasons and that will let me finally let go of most of these ugly Ikea bags. I can also totally see giving these as gifts because who doesn't love a huge tote bag? I mean this thing would come in handy for just about anyone.If I had 2 (tiny) complaints, I would love to see more patterns (I like subdued patterns, like tone on tone paisleys, etc vs. bright patterns) and I would love an outside pocket or 2. But other than that, this thing is amazing and I'm so glad I bought it! Well worth the money!",
