                "reviewText": "At first glance this might look like it was made from your grandmother's favorite quilt. It looks delicate and certainly feminine. It is not delicate. This is a very tough and durable well made duffle bag/gym bag constructed from a deceptively tough fabric.Starting with the handle/strap. I'd say you could probably pack 40 LBS in this bag and your arm will wear out before the strap will.The fittings are all highly polished chrome like brass. They actually look gold plated. Only you will know they aren't. Between the zippers and the rivets and the vents and the D-Rings they make this look like a bag that cost you 20 times what you paid for it.There is a water proof side zippered compartment perfect for putting either muddy shoes or a wet towel in. On the other side is a compartment with a detachable key ring/fob where you can keep your keys. That's not in any of the photos. That is a very handy feature.At one end is an open pocket big enough for a water bottle and a sandwich. At the other end is a vented zippered compartment for the shoes and in fact big enough for sneakers AND some sandals or a pair of cowboy boots.Inside the main compartment there is a zippered compartment that you could keep a wallet, phone and few more items in. Then there are three open pockets in side the main compartment big enough for some toiletries. Then there is that main compartment itself which you could stuff a full length dress, undies AND a hat and jacket and gloves in if you are more or less average size. Seriously this could be a weekend bag that fits in the overhead compartmentAll in all I don't think you are going to find a more elegant and durable gym bag that can also function as very practical carry on luggage.I highly recommend this for all of the above uses and for making your friends jealous.",

                "reviewText": "LOVE. THIS. BAG! It is super cute and just the right size. And it has a place for gym shoes, woo-hoo! I really do not like carrying more than one bag. BEFORE this bag, I would put each shoes in its own bag plastic grocery bag, then put both inside another plastic grocery bag because the truth is that the ground is disgustingly dirty, and I did NOT want to mix up anything my shoes picked up with anything else as far as I could. Now i keep a few empty grocery bags in the shoe compartment, put my shoes in a fresh bag every time I take them off to put them in the gym bag and viola! Fast, easy, and germ-free because I toss the bag out when I put the shoes on. The shoe compartment keeps the shoes away from the rest of the items in the bag. And the bag is just the right size, it is so CUTE and no one else has it, so I know which bag is mine. It's well made, cute, sturdy, and well designed. I love it.",

                "reviewText": "This likely is the best low to midrange weekend bag I've ever owned. It's cute, stylish, much heavier than expected, and bonus points: Super long strap which is a personal preference of mine and also this thing may be completely waterproof. I took it to the sink and poured a glass of water on it just to see what would happen and it beaded up and ran right off. You couldn't tell it had been wet at all. This is a big deal if you're planning on using this as a weekender which I am as it may have to face up to rain storms.The hardware on it is not the highest end I've ever seen, but again: for the cost? It's perfectly fine and my guess is it will hold up to moderate to heavy use. I wasn't crazy about the package arriving all rolled up which misshaped the makeup bag a bit but I think the creases will probably come out in time.Again, it's MUCH MUCH heavier fabric than I expected and the quilted design is super cute. I would absolutely order this again, and I may order another one in a different color so I can tell them apart because I'm going to use this positively to death. Now to go buy some attractive luggage tags to attach.",
