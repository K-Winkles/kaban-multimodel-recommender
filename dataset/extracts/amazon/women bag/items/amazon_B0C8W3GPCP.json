                "reviewText": "As expected, this Vera Bradley pouch is excellent quality. The zipper is sturdy and smooth. The interior is divided and half of the pouch is plastic lined. I would slightly prefer a full coverage plastic lining, but the partial lining provides some protection against items like make up brushes and the ability to wipe clean. I used the pouch for first aid supplies on a recent family trip and it was a nice size to hold various salves/ointments, band aids, etc.My only complaint is that the material significantly attracts pet hair and lint. We have several pets, so that is a huge issue for my family. If I had a patterned version this might not be such a big deal, but mine is black and it shows terribly.",
