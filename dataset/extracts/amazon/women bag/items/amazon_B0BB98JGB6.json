                "reviewText": "I had been in search of a spacious tote bag that actually had a zipper, and I\u2019m so glad I came across this bag.It\u2019s a great size, though personally I wouldn\u2019t mind it being a tad bit bigger even. But it\u2019s still a great size for daily use.I personally keep my purse in it- plus water bottles, a toiletry bag, a bag of snacks to take to work with me everyday and it\u2019s perfect.The color is super cute and the material feels pretty good, like it will hold up for a while atleast. I\u2019m grateful it doesn\u2019t have one of those cheap zippers either, I\u2019ve had no issues with it getting stuck like some bags like this do.HIGHLY recommend this bag. If you\u2019re like me and like to carry a good amount of stuff around and want a casual cute bag this is perfect. Will definitely repurchase when this one eventually wears out.",
