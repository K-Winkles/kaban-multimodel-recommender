                "reviewText": "Right now this is my wife\u2019s favorite tote, and she\u2019s got so many I call her the bag lady. It\u2019s priced right and perfectly sized. You can throw your laptop in it, and still have room for whatever else you want with no problem.Outside, the look is classy and \u201cdesigner\u201d. The white stitching is absolutely perfect, and the thread they used is thick and rugged looking. The bottom collapses flat in the center for storage, but flares out enough to stand on its own even when empty.It also has 3/8\u201d tall brass \u2018feet\u2019 that keep your bag\u2019s fabric from touching the floor. So if you go into the bathroom or some other nasty place, you can set the bag down without the fabric touching anything disgusting.There\u2019s a zippered pocket on one side, and a little strap pocket to slip over your rolling luggage\u2019s extended handle on the other. The carry handles on this are wrapped with vegan leather, and very thick. The shoulder strap clips on and off with easy-to-actuate metal clips, and it\u2019s wide enough to be comfortable even with a full load.The inside is very nicely lined with a silky kind of material. Lots of pockets, padding, and zippers. Everything is sewn perfectly, with plenty of reinforcement. Even the top corners have pieces of vegan leather riveted over them for added protection. (It looks great, too.)My wife really likes the square metal rings that allow the handles to fall to the side, instead of sticking up. It\u2019s a small thing, but something that bugged her about another tote she has.The little clutch it comes with is also nicer than expected. It\u2019s made of the same materials, and has the same decorative accents as the big bag. The clutch has a removable wrist strap.Hope this helps.",

It easily fits my 13 inch laptop with plenty of room for folders, notepads, etc. I put my water bottle down and snacks in the second inside compartment. There are two outside zippered compartments. One is a smaller one that would be perfect for a cell phone and the other is a large one for whatever else you might need to carry. There are two separated inside compartments (Bo zipper for your laptop etc, as well as a divider that has its own cushion pouch. There is also an inside zipper compartment that would hold a Kindle or other reader. There are slots for pens as well. An outside strap fits over rolling suitcases, so that you don\u2019t have something else to carry on your arm. They really thought of everything. So impressive. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that the quality of the zippers is just So so. They do tend to get a little bit of a wave in them and sometimes get a tad sticky, but not too bad. Overall, I would definitely order it again.",

There are many zippers and compartments, which I love because I bring this to work each day and include a snack, lunch, water bottle & paperwork. I need to keep my work papers separate from the food items and this back does the trick. It has two outside zippered pockets, two sections inside, one large and two smaller pockets inside and two pen holders. ALSO, it came with a little black matching wristlet (not so small for a wristlet: 8 1/2\" x 6\"). It has 6 slots to hold credit cards, etc. Both bags are made from a black, tightly weaved fabric - very lovely!",

The handles, zippers, and material are strong, and the craftsmanship is high quality. The seams are all evenly sewn with no gaps or puckers. The zippers operate smoothly. There is a surprising amount of room for it being such a sleek, narrow design. I can put all the cords, accessories, and laptop in their place and secure them from movement inside the case. For as sturdy as it is, it is surprisingly lightweight. This makes it easy to carry as it doesn't cause the shoulder strap to bite the skin. The smaller handles are perfect for hand carrying the bag and doesn't fatigue the wrist or shoulder. I am very happy I ordered this bag, and I would order this bag again!",
