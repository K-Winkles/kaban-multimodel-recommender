                "reviewText": "Got the Narwey hanging toiletry bag for my upcoming 6-week trip through SE Asia. It packs a lot, organizing toiletries between the main body and side pockets. The tall center section is good for bottles and shower supplies, while the side pockets are nice for grouping things I use together (make-up on one side, hair stuff on the other). And that leaves the top pockets for medical stuff & contacts, and the front pocket for quick grab stuff like toothbrush or lozenges. I may even hang dangling earrings from the mesh pocket inside the front flap. I am struggling to secure travel-size toiletries into place, as this kit seems to be made for full-size bottles. The bottom line for me: with this much space, it's tempting to pack too much.",

                "reviewText": "I often travel for work, but they are typically short trips. However, occasionally I will go on week long trips that require more packing. I got this travel bag because it is bigger than my current one which I typically use for three or four day trips. This travel toiletry bag was perfect for my 7 day long trip that I recently had to go on. I needed to pack a few more things than I typically do, and everything fit perfectly in here. I was even able to fit my husband's toiletries. The hook is also better than my other one, as it is larger and easier to hang anywhere. Since the hook was so small on my other travel toiletry bag I often had a hard time trying to find somewhere to hang it in some of the hotel room bathrooms.The middle pocket is big enough where I can put items around the outside and still fill up my makeup bag and put it in the big open space. It would be nice if it came with its own makeup bag for the middle, but honestly, I have plenty of them to use so that's not a big deal to me. I love all the additional pockets it has and how it zips up nice and compact (not super compact though, this is still a pretty large toiletry bag). It fits in my medium sized luggage perfectly, and everything stays perfectly in place during my suitcase travels.I thought I wasn't going to like this bag when it first arrived because it was bigger than my other one, however, I ended up really loving it after using it. I believe this is now my new travel toiletry bag.",

                "reviewText": "I was expecting a toiletry travel case foresure. I was not not expecting an apartment. Don\u2019t get me wrong. The travel case is great. Built extremely well. The quality of material and make was very well considered and facilitated into this travel piece. I am extremely happy and am excited about this travel case.I am not complaining and I am not negating the use, but case offers so much capacity. It will be difficult for myself to ever fill up. This size of the travel appears it will exceed TSA liquids rule. Unless you are checking your luggage with the airline. Carry-on may be a little more tricky.Although the clear ziplock bags should be easy accessible, whether standard or Precheck eligibility. Depending on your packing style and needs. Some conversations are probably warranted.Carry-Ons: So don\u2019t think you would be able to get away with it. You will definitely would need to manage your containers to make the appropriate sizes. Even so, you will have so much room remaining, you will be left with an oversized travel bag that would take up room in the suit case.Overall not very compact. It will be probably best for car travel where your goods can be limitless to your content.Still built extremely well and the material used is of good quality. The interior is nylon for easy of cleaning and maintaining. Inside and outside, the stitching is done with care and neatness. The overall design is very well thorough and well considered.This case is going to be to the eyes of the beholder. For me, I think it will be more than what i would need, but still very useful. My intended use is for air and car travel.",

I have to have a bag that is ready to go but also can carry a lot of items. I love this brand; it has always been quality for me (I have a few different items I use for travel) so when I saw they had this version I thought I would give it a try.This bag is huge and so very compact at the same time! I LOVE it. It holds everything I need for my GO bag. In the center of the bag, I have all my toiletries: shampoo/conditioner. sanitizer, soap, toothbrush, toothpaste, wipes, medications, drink powders and more. In one side pocket I have backup batteries, cords, and chargers, even a small book or kindle. In the other side I put shower cap, loofah and the like that can be wet and need to pe separated both sides re lined so they are easy to wipe out if they get dirty or wet).There are so many pockets, straps, zippered pockets, and more that there are so many possibilities for this bag! It comes with a hanger and it holds up well, but you can also use this on the counter as you would any other toiletry bag. It zips up well and compact, it fits easily in any bag or luggage I have and it travels well. I can even fit a set of extra clothes in the main section if I really needed to.I just love this bag; it is my new favorite for everyday travel and overnight stays. It has taken the stress out of the need to go immediately calls I get for work! I highly recommend this bag!",
