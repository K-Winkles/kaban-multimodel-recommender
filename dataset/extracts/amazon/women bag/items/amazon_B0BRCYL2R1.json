Each item must be in containers no larger than 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) and placed in a single, clear, plastic, quart-sized bag. What is the purpose of clear TSA approved toiletry bags in different sizes? TSA approved toiletry bags are designed to meet the airline's 3-1-1 rule for storing liquids, gels, and aerosols in carry-on luggage. They are made of clear plastic so they can easily be seen by TSA personnel when passing through a security checkpoint. The different sizes allow travelers to choose the right bag for their needs, such as a small bag for a few essential items or a larger bag to store all of their toiletries.",

Traveling with liquids can be a hassle but this Packism clear makeup bag makes it easier. Tips: 1. Is it normal for clear plastic cosmetic bags to harden in winter? Yes, it is normal for a clear plastic makeup bag to become stiff in cold weather. This is because the material's molecular chains slow down, making it less flexible. To help keep the bag soft and pliable, it is best to store it in a warm place and keep it away from direct sunlight. Secondly, you can try using hot water if the piece is small and thin or a hair drier on hot if a small section of a larger piece needs to be softened. Additionally, some people recommend adding a few drops of olive oil or coconut oil to the bag to help keep it soft and pliable.",

                "reviewText": "I used this bag (the smaller of the two) on a recent domestic flight to hold my fluids and had no issues with TSA. So much easier to pack and organize than an actual quart Ziploc bag, which is what I was using before. And it held so much stuff (photos for reference). I normally don't take much makeup while I travel, but this trip was for a wedding with several dressy events throughout the weekend, so I had to find room for the works. The bigger one was great for holding all my other non-liquid toiletries as well. I usually just tuck smaller stuff like eye shadow pallets in amongst my clothes and hopefully for the best but having them all corralled in one bag was wonderful. I like that both sides are clear so you can easily see what you're looking for before opening the bag, and I love the dual zippers too. Overall a great find and the quality is awesome for the price.",
