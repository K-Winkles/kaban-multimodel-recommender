I paid more than I would normally under the agreement she will use it for a few years. We love the color and pattern. It does the job, but it is a little smaller than expected. However we make it work, it's just filled to the top... for example, we manage to fit a small Thermus, small Gatorade bottle, snack size bag of chips, small bag of grapes, a snack size bag of cookies. Since the bag sits vertically rather than horizontally, some of the items are stacked on top of one another. So at lunch time, she has to take everything out vs use the lunch box as kind of a placemat. Otherwise, happy with this purchase and plan to make it last a few school years if we can.",
