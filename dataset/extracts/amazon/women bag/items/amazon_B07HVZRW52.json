It will hold a tablet, your phone, wallet and makeup etc. It is light in weight but also very sturdy. The handles are long enough that you can wear the handbag over the shoulder and they don't slip off. I believe that the material of which it is made will wear well and last for a long time. I am thrilled with it. It looks very attractive too! Thank you for a great product!",
