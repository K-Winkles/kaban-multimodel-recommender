Not only does it offer the same stylish and sporty vibe as the original, but it comes at a fraction of the price. The quality of the materials used is surprisingly impressive, making it feel sturdy and durable.The design is incredibly versatile, allowing my niece to wear it around her waist or across her chest \u2013 perfect for both rugged and casual outings. The adjustable straps ensure a comfortable fit for all body types, and the zippered compartments provide ample space for essentials like keys, phone, wallet, and even a small water bottle...or in my nieces case, lip gloss, nail polish, hair scrunchies, and a juice box.One of the standout features of this du-pe is its thoughtful organization. The interior pockets help me keep my belongings neatly separated and easily accessible. The zippers glide smoothly and haven't snagged once, which is a pleasant surprise for a bag in this price range.I also appreciate the attention to detail in the stitching and overall construction of the bag. It's evident that the manufacturers took their time to replicate the premium look and feel of the original Lulu-lem0n version.We received numerous compliments on this bag, with friends and even strangers asking where we got it. It's a testament to how close this du-pe comes to the real thing. For anyone who loves athleisure fashion but doesn't want to break the bank, I wholeheartedly recommend this belt bag. It's a fantastic accessory that combines style, functionality, and affordability in one package.",

Kept the essentials right at hand, so lightweight it didn't feel like wearing a thing, easy zippers, small enough to throw in a beach bag or larger backpack, the strap adjusts quickly and easily, etc. The back zip pocket is great for a standard phone, the main pocket easily fits a small wallet, keys, a lippy or two, and a travel pack of tissues. The only small improvement I could think of would be to add a zip or velcro to one of the interior sections for something like a single key you don't want to slip out on accident. But there are other ways to manage those little problems so no big deal. Oh and the tabs on the two zippers are pretty jingle-y together, which doesn't both me but might other people.",

Slightly too small for what I needed. As a plus size lady I had to open the strap all the way to wear it crossbody. It did fit but was a little snug.",

Some reviews show the strap ripping but in my opinion if your pouch is being weighed down causing that to happen then just buy a purse. This is for essentials not for someone who needs random extra stuff on the go. The zipper pieces are a bit loud because they are heavier duty but I don\u2019t notice it too much out and about.",
