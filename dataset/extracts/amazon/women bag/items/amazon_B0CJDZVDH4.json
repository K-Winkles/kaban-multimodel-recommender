                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I love this toiletry organizer, and seriously don't know how I've traveled without it all these years! The quality is excellent. It's well made and the quilting on the outside is done very nicely. All of the compartments, pockets, elastics and zippers are quite sturdy. It holds a TON of stuff! I took this on a 2 week trip to Ireland and everything I needed fit in here with room to spare. I could have easily fit more if I had to. Before I bought this I would throw all of my toiletries into a plastic bag and shove in my suitcase which always took up way more room than necessary and would end up an unorganized mess as time went on throughout my trip. When I travel I often don't stay in one place very long, and this organizer was fantastic to hang on the door at each stop and then just zip up and go when it was time to move on to the next destination. No more grabbing things from all over the place to shove them wherever I could and then worry about things leaking or being wet. The compartment I used for my shower cap, hair towel and loofah is waterproof and kept those things separate from everything else without worry of getting anything else wet if I packed them away still damp when I was on to my next place. The other compartments do have a bit of protection if something happens to leak but with the cloth backside I think a big leak may find its way through. I am confident this wouldn't be a problem though as the pockets and built in straps hold everything very securely. I had no issues with anything at all leaking or breaking and I had a few glass things packed in there. This organizer is a complete game changer for travel, and I'm so happy I bought it! I highly recommend!!!",

I love that each of the sections zips and is waterproof. I'm no longer worried about leaks or anything. I also have enough space to fit an ENTIRE shampoo bottle, razors, deo, etc and not risk losing anything. Jewelry fits in it too. 10/10 love it. My mom wanted one too. Also, it does get heavy (obviously) so be careful where you hang it up. I tended to just keep it on the counter. Would definitely buy again.",
