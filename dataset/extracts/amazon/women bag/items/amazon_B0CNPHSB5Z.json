The polyester mixed with PU design combines the durability of polyester with the elegance of PU material. The polyester offers sturdy and durable support, while the PU adds a glossy, upscale look, ensuring the bag is both practical and fashionable. How should I clean and maintain the polyester mixed with PU laptop bag? For the polyester part, gently wipe with a damp cloth, avoiding excessive moisture. For the PU sections, it's best to lightly wipe with a clean, dry cloth. Avoid using harsh chemical cleaners to prevent damage to the materials. What should I do if the polyester sides have wrinkles from long transportation? For wrinkles caused during transportation, a simple solution is to use steam ironing. Gently iron over the polyester part with a steam iron, ensure the temperature is not too high and avoid direct contact with the PU areas.",

Someone did mention that the zipper can get hung on when going over the edge of the purse and it does, so you need to pull the end of the zipper taught so that the whole piece is flat and then it'll zip just fine. For me this isn't an issue, but if you're often in a situation where you need to close or open it one handed then this would be a problem.",

You can carry it with the short straps over your arm or shoulder, or use the detachable padded shoulder strap to carry it more like a messenger bag or crossbody. The gold hardware adds a classy touch to the bag, and it even has metal feet on the bottom to protect the bottom of the bag from rough or dirty surfaces.

                "reviewText": "High quality bag with sturdy feeling handles and it stands up by itself without flopping over. The pockets on the inside are well thought out. The inner pockets on each end can hold an insulated water bottle, power brick, or USB power bank are especially helpful - keeping those heavier items upright and contained is great. I was planning to use this as a laptop bag, but had to repurpose it for a teaching bag. It holds a standard D ring 1\" binder easily in the laptop area and I can use the smaller, tablet area for other smaller materials.Deducting 1 star because my 17\" laptop does not fit. The total width is ok, but my laptop is a slightly older workhorse and it is just over 1\" thick. The thickness prohibits it from slipping into the laptop pocket. If your laptop is thinner, I would highly recommend this bag. The shoulder strap, accessory bag, and dust cover all add to the high-end functionality of this bag.",
