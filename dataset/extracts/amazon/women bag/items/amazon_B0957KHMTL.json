I was disappointed in the quality of the strap and was going to return it. The only reason I didn\u2019t is because I took the ribbon strap off and added a thicker strap I already had. The bag is small for the price but I do not like big bags. A phone some keys and a wallet and your AirPods is about all that fits in it but that part is ok for me.",

The cheap slide buckles would slide up to shorten or down to lengthen the straps but wouldn\u2019t secure, so the bag was always at the longest length. I tied a knot on each side of the straps so the length would stay in place. I kept the bag, but wasn\u2019t happy with the quality.",
