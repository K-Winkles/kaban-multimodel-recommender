The animal print strap is super cute, too, and of course you can switch out the strap to change the look. The hardware on the handbag is silver, too, not gold if you wonder. I love the size of the bag, it's perfect for me.The bag is very well made. It is completely lined in a gray fabric, with one inner wall having two slip pockets, and the other having a zippered pocket. The corduroy fabric is very sturdy and attractive, and the pink color is beautiful. I've had the bag for a couple months, and it's holding up well, no problems at all. The zipper closure for the bag is great, too, so your items are secure.The only thing which could make this bag perfect, would be an outer zip pocket. But, it's still just about perfect as is, and I love it!",

I love the added handles for grabbing it quickly out of the car. I love the front storage pocket (perfect size foe my kindle), and I love that there are interior pockets as well. The zipper is great and strong. This bag truly surprised me with its value and quality. I'm looking forward to embroidering the strap to personalize it!",

There is a small zippered pocket on the inside to keep your valuables secure, and another zippered pocket on the outside for secure but easy access to your phone, keys, etc. . The inside has a nylon lining so it is east to wipe clean. The water-resistant corduroy material is well stitched together and seems strong. It has a built in handle and I like that it also has a detachable and adjustable shoulder strap which I prefer to use. It comes in various colors and I chose the brown one. It looks fine but I would have liked it to be a darker brown. It is a great tote bag to take with you on everyday errands, day trips and outings.",
