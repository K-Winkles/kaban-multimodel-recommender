                "reviewText": "This review is for the Montana West Sling Bag Crossbody for Women Cross Body Fanny Packs.So this little montana west/wrangler sling bag is just darling! So if you have read some of my other reviews then you may know I'm a long time fan of the brand. It's faux leather but it's nicely done, has a nice soft supple feel with a smooth feeling but you can see a bit of texture to it such that real leather might have.So I got this in the yellow just to get something different than my usual. I must say I'm NOT usually a \"yellow\" color kinda person. This is a nice golden yellow, not an in your face neon yellow. But it is definitely more yellow than it looked on my laptop, it looked like a yellow that had a lot of brown undertone to it. So as luck would have it I just recently found a little yellow genuine leather wallet at the thrift store that will go perfectly with this bag! I had no idea why I was drawn to the yellow wallet not being a yellow kinda color person as I said, it was fate is all I can say LOL.I love love love that do their bags with the detachable straps, it allows me to change up the look so easily! And love the metal zippers! The attention to detail is very evident with perfect stitching throughout and well designed and executed small sling bag.So to start on the back of the bag is a nice hidden vertical zipper pocket which I love. This pocket is small, but still useable for small items like chap stick, lighter, a small bi of cash... the zipper on this pocket is nylon but it works smoothly with a metal pull. Also on the back you will find a metal ring a the top and on each side attached by loops, this allows you to carry the sling bag in a left or right side carry, whatever you like. This strap has a lot of room to adjust it and of course has the montana west brand on it with metal hardware.Moving around to the front on the lower portion you will find the montana brand on a patch. About 3/4 of the way up you will find a horizontal zipper for a front pocket that is hidden under a lip of material from above it, this may make it difficult for some to get into this pocket as it's kinda tight, I have small hands and it's fine for me. But this is a good place for something like your vehicle key fob, if you have a new vehicle you will not really need to have access to it.Moving up to the top of the bag you will find 2 smoothly working metal zipper close pockets. The zippers go from a couple inches down the one side up across the top and down a couple inches on the other side so they open nice and wide for ease of access. The inside of the pockets are all nicely lined with a smooth soft silky material. the back main pocket has 3 slots sewn to the backside material for cards/ID, personally I prefer to keep my stuff in a wallet but may use them for like receipts or appt cards.... the rest of the pocket is open so I will most likely just slide my bifold wallet and cell phone in there or my wallet and glasses. The front pocket is not quite as thick front to back as the back one, but it does have an open top slip in pocket so this will be good for my cell phone, or maybe my cigs and glasses.I'm fine with this small size bag as I tend to travel lightly when going out for myself as I'm handicapped and my go to are crossbody/sling/backpack bags so my hands are free and my stuff secure. I use a cane in my right hand and my service dog's leash is in my left, I need both hands LOL. Less weight on me to carry around is better for my back anyway. Having said all that even I will say this bag is SMALL and will not suit all people.So all in all when I stack it up I really like it even though it's not real leather and VS the regular price $19.99 per the listing, there is a 5% off 2 select items with a nice array of choices...BUT hold the phone!!! I think this bag is worth the regular price, BUT right now there is a 50% off offer on it in a choice of colors and a couple of other items!!!! The other variation crossbody bag in black is on that 50% off, I would like to get it but in another color. The front zipper/slip pockets are different than on this one! One of these would make a nice gift too for a young girl.As always I only do honest reviews and will update if needed. I hope this helps you make the best choices how to spend your $.",

                "reviewText": "I have decided to downsize the purse I carry every day, this small sling bag looked like the perfect solution. Beware of the dimensions of this bag, 5\"*7.6\"*1.7\"(L*H*W), it really is small, to small to use as an everyday purse but I still love it. First it is leather and very well made, two main zippered compartments and two outside zipper pockets that I will be using. The outside zipper pocket in front is hard to get into so I decided to put my car keys in it, with the electronic push buttons on cars you don\u2019t need to get them out very often. The back zipper pocket I put my chap stick and roll of Tums. Although the main compartments has a few card holders I really don\u2019t like \u201cloose cards\u201d so put my small wallet change purse, in one side and my phone in other side. This is about all the room there is in this small purse, although there are a few slots and pockets inside. I did shove a small brush and a few misc items but that stuffed it, pretty much this is it. Without taking the phone and probably wallet out there is no room for sunglasses, probably to tight a fit anyways.Basically this is not the next step to downsize from a full size purse for every day, but perfect for outings. You can fit all the necessary items for a trip to the store, a walk, or a quick errand. Not being able to fit my glasses is not that big a deal can always wear on top of head and I do have enough \u201cstuff\u201d handy in my car to keep going.I would definitely recommend this small sling bag, especially if you are more of a minimalist.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Very good quality",
                "reviewText": "If you don't need to tote around much, maybe to replace a small purse, then this is a very sturdy and nice looking bag to have. It has a front pocket, a front and back main compartment with a small pocket inside one and credit-card-sized pockets in the other with a nice fabric divider between the two, and then a back side-entry pocket, which, lacking a flap, is easier to access than the front pocket.This will sound strange, but this bag's functionality suffers in the size that it is comes at the expense of its good quality. If it were \u00bd to 1 inch larger, even though small may be what some would be going for when buying it, it would function much better. The leather is a very nice quality thickness, and the zipper is also very rugged, aesthetics which drew us to this bag, but the overall rigidness combined with the smallish size makes getting into the front pocket with its flap difficult. In the main compartment my wife is able to keep her phone (in its wallet case), an inhaler, chapstick, and not much else. She could organize and cram more in there, but not without making her phone inaccessible or having to unpack everything to get at something in the bottom.I know size is a balance before it becomes a backpack, and this bag wasn't meant to be large. We're very happy with the look and feel of this bag. We just wish it were slightly larger in order to function better.",

The color is close to a fire engine red. The material is very soft and smooth. I love all the pockets and that they can be zipped closed. My favorite part is the strap. It's a nice heavy duty nylon and leather. This is the 1st small cross body bag that gives you multiple options with how to wear it. It has atleast 3 ways to style it or connect the strap to have a pocket close for ease. I love it ! I only wish I had purchased other colors when it was on sale ! A definite for those who no longer like carrying your bag in hand or only can wear it across the body and it lays awkwardly across the chest of stomach. This bag fixes all of those things !",
