                "reviewText": "Great dupe for the Marc Jacob\u2019s tote bag the stitching is a little off the strap holder came falling apart so I plan to glue it back together I\u2019m not a sewer and the strap for the excess zipper needs to be stitched a little higher up other than that the color is great I love it I got the grey but it\u2019s an in between of beige and of grey so id say it\u2019s more of Khaki still a beautiful neutral color that goes with everything the leather is soft but the handles and shoulder strap feel very Dainty not very sturdy material I love the engraved patch on the back of the bag the real MJ tote bag also has that engraved patch so it makes the bag look and feel even more real the inside isn\u2019t very greatly made I wish they would have put more time and attention into the inside of the bag it has one pocket inside and I plan to order an organizer for the inside as it has no other pockets overall the bag is great it does have a smell but it really doesn\u2019t bother me it\u2019s beautiful and not in the hundreds so you could get multiple different colors and no one would know just by glancing at it that it\u2019s not a real MJ it looks pretty authentic unless someone\u2019s closely inspecting it then you\u2019d be able to tell it\u2019s a dupe it\u2019s definitely worth the money I would recommend and this company has so many other cute ones including the mini tote bag the canvas material one and the bucket bag all in multiple different colors this bag is a medium size tote in case anyone was wondering not too big not too small and hold a lot I bought this bag after wanting a MJ one but not having the money for the MJ one and wanting something a little bigger than the Guess crossbody I\u2019ve carried for years and it does not disappoint also the stitching on the shoulder strap is a little messy has loose threads along it but those can easily be trimmed off",
