With multiple kids, we've got multiple water bottles and snacks that have to stay cold, and this is perfect to fit most of what we need. Although it's on the smaller end, we love that it's compact and easy to carry. It's insulated on the inside, so it's great to carry cheeses, sandwiches, or any other cold items. It doesn't stay cold for that long (~2 hours without an ice pack), but it's enough for what we need. We have bought Pack-it insulated bags that have built-in coolers for longer treks, but this bag is cute and does the trick for quick outings. The outside of the bag is a corduroy material, and I love the print. When our daughter goes to school, it'll be great to take as a lunch box (although it won't fit a bentgo or anything square-ish). For reference, I can comfortably fit her bottle laying down sideways, a sandwich, a bagged snack, and fruit. Easy to clean as it's the plastic insulated material on the inside.",

I can easily put it into my backpack, but the handle is sturdy enough that I can hold onto it as well. With an ice pack, it stays extremely cold. If the food is already cold, it will stay a decent temp without the ice pack.The color/pattern is so so cute. Love the small little strawberries!",

So cute but probably won't fit that much if you add a mini ice pack. But luckily they do sell some pouch type little ice packs that are thin maybe using that would work. Or just a regular pack with any regular lunch bowls you can find to make it work.Definitely small but big enough where it's functional. Without being overbearing to keep on the go. So obsessed with this strawberry bag.",
