                "reviewText": "This bag is so much better quality than I expected! It arrived, wrapped and packaged so thoughtfully. It came with a dust bag to place it in when not in use. But it's very large, plenty of space to fit everything I need for the office. There are so many thoughtful details including the multiple electronics pockets, elastic pockets on the inside for water bottles, an attached hook for your keys so you don't lose them in the bag, a wonderfully sized cosmetic bag that can be used for cords, makeup, pens, etc. It has metal feet on the bottom to keep the bottom of the bag off the floor and clean. The removable strap to wear crossbody or even just longer is comfortable and thick and incredible quality. The bag is sturdy, thick, and just gorgeous. A clean and classic look. I am obsessed.",

                "reviewText": "I really liked this bag but it just didn't do it for me and I had to return. It's way bigger than you'd expect but oddly can't fit much. The center zipper for laptops/tablets is in such a weird place. Since it goes through the middle of the bag you have the main section cut into two and can't really fit things in either side. I ended up having to bring another tote to work with me to hold things like my lunch, jacket, water bottle.As other reviews said, it gets really heavy. I didn't even put too much in it and it was pretty heavy compared to a normal bag/backpack with the same things inside (I think because of the material of it). I wanted a bag that could stay more organized but the slip pocked and zippers are a little useless and you just end up trying to fit most things in those two main compartments. The Canvas also gets dirty quickly (picks up pet hair, lint, etc.) so keep that in mind when choosing a color!However, it's really cute and seems like decent quality for a great price. It gives you a designer feel for under $50. The straps are comfortable/sturdy and the feet on the bottom are a plus to keep the bag clean/undamaged wherever you put it. The little bag that it comes with is great because it's actually a decent size to use as a small handbag or if you want necessities/your wallet in there for on the go. For me, I just didn't like the organization of it but wouldn't discourage others from buying it.",

It\u2019s a soft leather feel and the inside is lined with a high quality smooth material with pockets and sections galore !Currently have my laptop , iPad , full-size planner , a marble notebook , a 3 subject notebook and a file folder with about 70papers in it and there\u2019s still plenty of room yet everything stay in place . I could probably fit double of everything in it.Bonus points for the pouch it comes with too! The pouch even has sections in itOne of my favorite purchases. Not one complaint !",

I wanted a bag that things couldn\u2019t get \u201clost\u201d in and would be easy to find. This bag checked the boxes, but when I received it I wasn\u2019t overly impressed. It had a cute small matching bag for maybe makeup/toiletries and the placement of pockets inside was great. Quality of the outside was good, but the inside material was a disappointment, seemed cheap. I couldn\u2019t get past it and will be returning it. I even felt the zipper quality was poor and the length/placement of the top zipper was funny. Super long on one end where you need to tuck it into the bag and then it doesn\u2019t zip all the way to cover the top of the bag. Could use some improvements then would be a 5/5 star bag to me.",
