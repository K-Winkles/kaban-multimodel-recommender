I didn\u2019t even realize it came with an extra little purse with a long cross body strap. It fit perfectly under my United seat but I put it up because I needed to stretch my legs.

I love the crossbody bag that came with this tote. Put my wallet, phone and lipstick in it for going out for dinner while in vacation. The cosmetic bag is also good size. Next time I pack it I will use the lower section for something other than shoes. I shortened the tab on the pocket that's for a tablet. It was way to long letting the pocket fall open and in the way.",

Let\u2019s just say I still had plenty of space even after packing a change of clothes for each, toys, iPads, lunch box, snacks, blankets, pretty much anything you can think of I put in this bag.I did not use the charge port, or the storage bags for the shoes. However the quality of the shoe bags seem good and the additional storage bags are the same material as the bag itself which is very nice and durable.Again if you\u2019re thinking about it. Just buy it!",
