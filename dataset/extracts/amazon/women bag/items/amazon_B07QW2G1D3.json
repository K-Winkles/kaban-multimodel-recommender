Faux leather doesn't have a smell to it bor does it feel plasticy. It was received inside 2 plastic bags, but front of bag was still damaged. It came with a cut mark along the front and some seams that are a bit frayed. Straps are slightly more yellow than the camel/caramel faux leather. The extra purse strap wasn't as nice as expected but I won't be using it anyway so it can be removed. The inside pocket will be good for a 13in or small laptop or tablet. 15in slim was slightly too long, even at at angle. I am sending back for a replacement. I still feel it's a really good bag for it's price. Hopefully, the next one won't be damaged. Will update when new one arrives.",

Just do it.It comes in this lovely little protectant bag, that you see in the first picture - which WAS perfectly placed in the bag, but I had to go remove it \ud83d\ude44 so then I tried to shove it back in\u2026. just for a picture, which you can tell I didn\u2019t do a very good job of. (Better luck next time I guess\u2026.??) and when you pull it out, it just lays perfect\u2026..I don\u2019t even know how they do it.OK so listen, if you need a bag/backpack with lots of pockets and little places to put stuff, look no further my beautiful friend\u2026.THIS IS YOUR BAG.There are so many perfectly curated pockets, it\u2019s almost like they were in my brain when they made this bag\u2026.The quality is impeccable, especially for the cost\u2026 No one believed me when it came and I told them I paid 20 some odd dollars for it.BUT I SURE DID SUCKAS.So let me just reiterate\u2026.the bag is amazing, the quality is outstanding, and it\u2026.it really just is so perfect\u2026. I think I love it.So again-If you\u2019re on the fence, BUY the bag. You won\u2019t regret it.(I think I\u2019m going to order another color right now\u2026.)You\u2019re welcome.",

Yes, I got all three to test.However, this bag does not come with a separate compartment for the laptop alone so if that bothers you, you should get a sleeve.Otherwise, thumbs up for its material, functionality and design.
