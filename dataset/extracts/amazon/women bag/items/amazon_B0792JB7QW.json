After long days at the office I have a quick efficient bag that has many compartments for my beats headphones, my shoes, and a bigger compartment to hold clean towels, clothes and other stuff. Also noted it is slighty waterproof I took it inside the gym shower because I don't trust leaving it in the room changing areas so it kept my clothes dry even after getting spritz with water while I showered. Should fit in deep lockers horizontally or vertically in small ones. Great buy. Thanks",

I wanted a gym bag that would be big enough to fit all my gym essentials and my size 5 soccer ball and the ball fit perfectly with plenty of room to spare for my other stuff! The bag seems sturdy so far and in great condition. Would be a great overnight bag or carry-on as well if needed! It only has one side pocket other than the main zippered opening. Perhaps maybe a water bottle holder on the side would be nice to have, but for the price, I\u2019m not really complaining. So far, I would recommend this. It\u2019s great for us short people too because it doesn\u2019t overwhelm us and it\u2019s easy to carry!",

It\u2019s got just the right amount of room for clothes, shoes, etc. I even can put my pre work and water jug in it. Now.. it does not have a bottom support so it does kinda slouch down when you put things in which is quite annoying for me but was an easy fix. Took a piece of cardboard and made a bottom myself (I used 2 pieces) just to get the right amount of support I wanted. Other then that it\u2019s great, I\u2019m happy with the purchase.",
