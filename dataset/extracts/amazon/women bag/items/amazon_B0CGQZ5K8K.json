First off, it's way more stylish than your typical laptop bag \u2013 like, it doesn't scream \"I'm carrying a computer.\" The design is chic, and the color is on point, making it perfect for work meetings or just hanging out.The size is a win, too. My 15-inch laptop fits like a glove, and there's still space for all my random stuff. Inside, there are pockets for days \u2013 pens, chargers, you name it.It's pretty sturdy, which I love. The padded laptop part keeps my baby safe, and the whole thing just feels well-made. Plus, it's not just a work bag \u2013 I use it as my everyday purse. The adjustable straps make it easy to sling over my shoulder, whether I'm heading to the office or a weekend coffee sesh.The little details are cool, too. It's got this subtle style without being too flashy, and the zippers are smooth as butter. Honestly, it's become my sidekick for everything \u2013 work, play, you name it. I'm totally loving this stylish and handy addition to my daily grind!",

                "reviewText": "This purse has a lot of great features about it. First, I like how big it is. The size accommodates laptops, spiral notebooks, and one inch binders. There are slots for pens and pencils, cell phones, and smaller paper notebooks. There are zip pockets and three divided areas inside the purse. The fabric inside the purse is tan, so be careful about leaving your makeup out. It will stain. The tote comes with shoulder straps and a smaller purse.The outside material is durable and looks like stains won't take to it easy. I got the green color, and it is very nice, very rich. The sewing looks great. I didn't see any snags or tears on the threads.I am pleased with this tote.",

It is durable and the quality is great- it looks way more expensive than it is. It comes with a cute clutch that make it possible for me to carry only the laptop bag to work without a chunky separate purse. At lunch or to run errands, I just slip out the clutch. The green color is simply gorgeous. There\u2019s also a lanyard/key fob tab inside where you can clip in your badge or keys so they\u2019re convenient to reach without digging in your bag. I love this bag!",
