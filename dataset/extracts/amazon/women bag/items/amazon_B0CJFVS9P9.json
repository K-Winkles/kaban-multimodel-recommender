There's a back Zipper pocket for extra items. My issues however with this bag is first the strap isn't long enough to my liking. Even at the longest length it comes above my hip which I can't stand. Compared to my addidas bag the strap is way shorter. My addidas bag comes just below my hip which I prefer. Second, I wish the Zipper opening was more wide. It's a little narrow and doesn't open much to find things. The bag is wider than my addidas bag for sure. Overall it's a nice bag if you don't mind the narrow opening and short strap.",
