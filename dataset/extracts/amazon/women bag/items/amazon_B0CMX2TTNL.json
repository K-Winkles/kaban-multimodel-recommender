                "reviewText": "This is a nicely sized tote bag that folds up into a small square. I used it the last few days to carry everything I need for work - lunch, tablet, and laptop for work. I ordered the black and gray version of the bag and it looks nice - even got a compliment on it from one of my coworkers. I like how deep the side pockets are, though I wish the bands that secure things inside weren't so exposed - I've caught them on a couple things. The bottom of the bag is wide enough that the bag will stand up on its own and not randomly fall over and the straps are long enough to go over my arm and rest on my shoulder even with my winter coat on.My one complaint about the bag is the fabric. For the size of the bag, I feel like the fabric is too thin. I'm wary of putting too much into the bag for fear of tearing the cloth or popping a strap.",

                "reviewText": "I was actually excited opening this bag. I know that sounds silly and it did surprise me. The first thing I thought about was finally, a cute bag that folds up small, that I can carry in my purse for a quick trip to the market, instead of carrying around plastic bags. It opens up rather large and holds quite a bit of stuff. It held up well and was easy to carry on my shoulder to the car and into the house. I had a lot of compliments on it at the market yesterday.It's very light weight but durable and quite roomy with a secure zipper on top. It has wide pockets on the outer sides that can hold your water bottles and more. There is also a small pocket inside and a zipper pocket on the outside. The bungees that zigzag around the sides are convenient for smaller loads.This bag would be great for travel, be it on a plane or just to the beach. A cute bag to carry around the mall that will carry all your new treasures and much more stylish than plain ol' paper or plastic bags.I love this bag and well worth the small price.",

It is designed well and assembled with care for durable results. It is attractive AND be totally useable. The shoulder straps are comfortable, even when there is some weight in the bag. The main interior pocket is very roomy, large enough for a sweatshirt or towel. The opening is also large enough to reach in. The stretchy cords on both sides are great for tucking in a water bottle and clipping on things you can grab when on the move. Topping off the storage is a zippered pocket on the outside of the bag. The bag seems very well made, durable enough to last. While I haven\u2019t tested this yet, the bag is machine washable.Looking forward to traveling with this bag.",

                "reviewText": "Depending on your needs, this bag can be a hit or a miss. It is very light weight but doesn't look solid and well-constructed. I do like the linen look of the tote. It is priced right, I think. But the white material is very thin and almost see through. It is large enough to carry plenty of large items. I do like the extra-large pockets on the side for a water bottle. There is one reason for the 4 star and not a 5-star review, is the strap that is used for folding the tote. It just kind of hangs there. There is nowhere to tuck it in when not in use. If you want an inexpensive tote that is large enough to carry workout equipment or large items, I recommend this item. If you are looking to show that you spent a lot of money on a tote, this may not be the one for you.",

                "reviewText": "This BAGSMART foldable tote actually folds up into a tiny little pouch, just like it describes. This is important to me because I\u2019ve purchased so many \u201ccompact\u201d and \u201cfoldable\u201d bags that once you use them one time, you can never fold them up again. Not the case with this little gem. For the price point, you really can\u2019t beat it. It\u2019s lightweight but durable. Comfortable shoulder straps, a large interior pocket, and bungee cords on both sides perfect to stash hats, sunglasses, or keys. It zips closed and also has an exterior zippered pocket. It\u2019s perfect for travel or every day use.",

                "reviewText": "Great tote bag for for a gym or a beach tote, for an extra bag in the car for shopping. This takes place of plastic and paper for dry goods when shopping, but is not an insulated bag. This folds fairily small and has a snap to keep it closed. Straps are sturdy, zippers are good quality. There are two large pockets on the outside sides, plus a zipper pocket, and a pouch inside. It is overpriced for the type of bag, but it is useful.",
