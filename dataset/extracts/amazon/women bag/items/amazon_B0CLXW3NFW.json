                "reviewText": "Whenever I travel, I like to tuck a collapsible bag in my suitcase because I always end up needing a bit more space. The trouble with most collapsible travel bags is that they are so flimsy. I have found that they are often almost disposable and good for only a handful of uses. But a more durable tote would have to be bulkier, right? Not with this awesome tote! It is as small as my other travel backpacks but it opens up to a really sturdy tote that's the perfect size and well-built enough for continued use. You would never guess a bag that gets as large as this one can become as compact as this can. Not only does it open into a nice-sized tote bag, but that tote bag also expands several more inches on the bottom! I'm SO happy with this! It has become my new weekender bag because it is constructed with enough quality for daily use. It has plenty of pockets and slots inside and out. It even has a place to secure your laptop inside, though it is not padded because it would otherwise not be able to collapse so small, but it secures it in place and separates it from the other items in your bag. I am super happy with this bag and pleasantly surprised and impressed.",

                "reviewText": "When this arrived on my doorstep, I thought I'd gotten the wrong item by accident. The package it came in was smaller and slightly thicker than my laptop... but it unfolded, and unfolded, and unfolded... and wow.It's much larger than I Originally expected, and I can fit both my laptop and my Macbook inside of it, along with their respective chargers, as well as a night's change of clothes. There's also little hidden pockets all over the inside and outside of it, so you can slip a USB dongle, or an external hard drive, or even a kindle without breaking a sweat.Already have a great, roomy laptop bag? Toss a fresh pair of socks, hand towel, and your workout clothes in it, and you have a workout bag as versatile as you are. Headed to the beach? Toss in your sandals, sunscreen, and a beach otel, with room for a couple of water bottles... or a cheeky water pistol. It's really limited only by your imagination, and ready to go whenever you are.My ONE criticism comes from the thin-feeling fabric, but it's stood up to the abuse my life has thrown at it so far. If that changes, I'll update this review to let you know. Meanwhile, it's definitely something that's great to have around, just in case. What that just in case is - that's for you to dream up!",

                "reviewText": "This item arrived quickly, and was well wrapped in plastic and tape. It was in its fully compact form, a 10x8x2 inch pack with an external zip area. The material of the bag is luxe, very sturdy. I got the green bag, it is a soft mint color, very pretty. I immediately opened the nylon zipper to reveal the largest size bag. Sturdy strap handles well sewn. Several storage options inside and out, and several zip areas. The outer pocket becomes an inner pocket on the other side with a flip and zip. A VERY inspired and unique design! I was excited to take this handy bag traveling or to markets or on trips... except for a fatal flaw.The zipper to transform this bag from the largest size to the smaller size is nylon. It is a LOT to zip, nearly twice around, and there is a lot of fabric to tuck away to keep it out of the zipper path. I zipped it about a third of the way around, and it would not go any further, and it wouldn't unzip either! I didn't want to force it and break the zipper, as my hands are not strong. So it was stuck, and I was frustrated. Husband was finally able to carefully free it, and I could zip it the rest of the way. Phew! A metal zipper, although it would add weight, would also add confidence in transforming the bag. Perhaps with use the extra fabric won't be a problem. But will the zipper hold up? The zipper becomes the bottom \"seam\", so it's taking all the weight of what you put in it at the smaller sizes. We shall see...You need the bag to be fully open to fold it back into its smallest form. So that zipper will get lots of use. It is a heavier nylon, but I think a metal zip would give more lifetime to the bag.Zipping it back into its smallest size is a bit confusing, and requires a lot of futzing to get everything folded and flipped and zipped. The photos help a little, but a video would be better, even if it's awkward and long.So if you are using this bag at its largest size only, I say it's amazing. At the next smaller size, only the zipper stands in your way. I didn't try the smallest bag size, I need to look at the photos again. It involves the snaps at the sides.Getting it back into compact travel square is a challenge that is worth it for travel.So although this bag needs a few changes, the basic design is incredible. I'm excited to keep working with this bag.",

                "reviewText": "There are many things about this bag that I love. I can slip it over the handle of my suitcase, and it stays there securely. You can fold it up into itself and take it with in your suitcase empty and them fill it up at your destination. It has a wet compartment and a dry compartment, perfect for the gym enthusiast. All in all this is a very nice bag. Whether you are traveling or just going to the gym, it would be perfect, and I have no hesitation about recommending this bag.",

                "reviewText": "I got this bag to take to the gym. It looks lovely. It seems to be middle quality.It is spacious especially in the way of being deep. So you can put long items in it that generally don\u2019t fit in a sports bag.The wet pocket is really small though. You could not fit much more than a bathing suit in it -maybe a guy\u2019s pair of shorts. I wasn\u2019t very impressed with the lower zipper to make the bag smaller. It gets stuck every time. I have not used it for long so idk about durability.",
