I gave her both purses today as a surprise and she decided that the (Montana) was too large and she accepted the other purse instead - it is a smaller crossbody easy to carry for when she needs to use her walker. So thanks to mom picking the other purse that was definitely more suitable, I get to keep and enjoy this lovely Wrangler! .... Just let me say that this purse is really nice, its medium sized and can fit a tablet. The quality of the material is good, it's durable and very roomy. The color I ordered is navy blue and it is truly charming.P.S. I had no idea Wrangler had such an amazing collection of bags for women. I think I am now hooked and can't wait to buy my next piece\u2764\ufe0f",

I can fit my small tablet and my big wallet plus my sunglasses and my regular glasses without it feeling stuffed full like my smaller purses. I\u2019ve only had it for a day so I can\u2019t speak to the durability but it feels really nice and soft and quality. Mine came with the Montana west brand which I\u2019m really glad because I liked that logo better on the bag. I also already own a Montana west tote bag purse and it has stood up to months of use and looks like real leather even though it\u2019s not.Got it for a great price but I wish the price hadn\u2019t gone down by $4 on the day I received my bag. This happened to me on another item I bought from Amazon recently too. Oh well. I will update if this bag doesn\u2019t hold up like I hope it does. Reviewed and bought by Kevin\u2019s wife.",

Its expandable zipper at the bottom allows the purse to hold all of my essentials, but not be too big or bulky. I\u2019ve never had a regular handle and a shoulder strap at the same time, but I find I use both of them. The top access is easy and the inside has many pockets and zippered areas to store my things. I especially like the outside small zipper pocket for my keys and chapstick! This is one of the best purses I\u2019ve seen for the price (which was extremely reasonable!)",

Interesting description for the brand called Montana West.",
