                "reviewText": "I bought this bag specifically to put in my hospital bag (I\u2019m due with my second baby in March) and I want to be more organized this time around and keep my toiletries and makeup all in one bag. For only $10 I felt like it was worth buying even if it wasn\u2019t going to be that nice. The bag arrived today, and I was shocked when I opened it! The leather is so thick and the zipper is also very heavy duty and good quality. And it\u2019s actually bigger than I expected! I can\u2019t wait to use this bag, and I know it will last me a long time. Not only will it be good for my hospital stay but I could see this bag holding enough for an actual vacation as well! If you\u2019re thinking about buying, just do it you won\u2019t be disappointed!",
