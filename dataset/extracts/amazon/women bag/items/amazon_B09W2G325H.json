                "reviewText": "I bought the medium in black after reading reviews that the large doesn't fit under flight seats. I needed a personal item, something that wouldn't make waves on a flight AND doubles as a reasonable gym bag/work bag. The medium is the bag for me.The vented shoe compartment is great for shoes or lunch. I love being able to toss my lunch in the bottom instead of a separate lunch bag because it's one less problem to grab in the morning. Not to mention when I bring gym shoes to work, the vents help from having the smell brew in the bag so it's insufferable.I love the lining of it. It's not all waterproof, but it's definitely more resistant than canvas. I've carried it through rain (not downpour) and my laptop made it to work just fine. And all the compartments do help to organize things for easy access.The only draw backs I've noticed is how the outer bottle pockets are difficult to use if over stuffed. Luckily I don't pack a rigid bottle when I fly so my flexible hair and makeup pouches easily fit there. The lack of laptop pocket is also sad, but that is clear in the description so I just live with my choice by packing mindfully when going places with my laptop. The last draw back is the lack of rigidity in the bag. I do love the flex in the top so I can stuff a weekend worth of clothes in the top, but if nothing is in the bottom it is hard to free stand.Even with these draw backs it's still a 5-star for me!",

I\u2019m the type of girl who always needs her skincare, makeup, hair care products, extra clothes, hygiene products, chargers, etc when I\u2019m out of my house overnight. This duffel bag has been such a lifesaver and has saved me so much hassle when it comes to staying out and keeping my things organized. I tend to sleep over at my boyfriend\u2019s house a lot and this has been my best friend. Even if I don\u2019t bring a ton of items, I can store extra things in it that I might get when I\u2019m out.This is definitely the perfect bag for any kind of travel and I know I\u2019ll be using it for every trip here on out. It\u2019s super high quality, has all the pockets you could ever need (including the amazing pocket for wet clothing), and is overall very pretty and sleek. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this last minute for a trip to use as my personal item. Overall it\u2019s great - good quality, the material is sturdy and seems like it will hold up for travel well. As you can see in the picture, it fit well under the plane seat despite being packed pretty much as full as it can be.I wear size 11 shoes and was able to fit 2 pairs in the bottom compartment.Only two main complaints (that overall really aren\u2019t that bad):1. The bag does not hold itself up in any way - it kind of looks like it would from the pictures but it is not a stiff material. It would be very squished if I didn\u2019t use the bottom compartment2. The \u201cwater bottle holders\u201d on the sides are about 4 inches too short so my metal water bottle kept falling out. Maybe a kids size bottle would stay in just fine.Overall it was worth the price for this trip and I can see myself using it again.",

There is so much space in this bag that I can fit almost everything I would need for a weekend trip in it. The shoe bags are super nice as well to make sure the bag and my clothes remain clean. I love the extra little bag that comes with it, perfect for my bathroom items. It's perfect for a carry-on option when flying.",

I love how it comes with 2 bags to place your shoes in and a separate compartment on the bottom that doesn\u2019t take away from the space inside! I also love how it came with a small accessory bag perfect to put travel sized products and the best part is you can connect a charging block inside the bag and charge your phone by connect a charging cable to the outside! This is perfect for a gym bag, overnight bag, or to even travel with! It could also be packed with a days worth of clothes, shower supplies and other necessities and kept in the car incase of emergency where you can\u2019t make it home or are leaving for other reasons. I recommend this bag. It\u2019s super durable and great quality!",

                "reviewText": "The photos make this bag look like a matte, rigid neoprene-type of fabric that would keep its shape. It's not. The material is a shiny, unstructured polyester. However, the many pockets are useful, especially the zippered shoe compartment. If you're not picky about the material looking high-quality and don't care if the bag flops around, then it'll be a perfectly serviceable duffel. However, I am a little disappointed that the fabric is cheap-looking and it's a little annoying to be fighting the bag's lack of structure when packing. I will probably be on the lookout for a more quality bag in the future, but it'll do in the meantime.",
