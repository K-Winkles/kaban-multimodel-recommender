                "reviewText": "I love the style of this lunch bag! It\u2019s so cute, and could totally be used as a purse with a small lunch. I like that the front and back pockets come out from the bag so you can actually put stuff in them without pushing into the interior space.I follow a whole food plant-based diet, so due to the low calorie density of plant foods, I take a lot of food with me to work and on picnics with my kids. For this reason, I\u2019d like the bag to be a bit bigger, but most people don\u2019t eat like me, so its size is probably perfect (or even with room to spare) for the average lunch packer.One of the pictures shows my daily smoothie in a 32 oz Nutri Ninja cup. The cup is a little taller than where the zipper is, but there is extra fabric built into the bag (the zipper level is a bit lower than the top of the bag), so I can still zip over the top of the smoothie cup. This also helps to stabilize the cup so it doesn\u2019t fall over in a less than packed bag! However, even if it did fall over, and if it did happen to leak, the bag would still be fine because the inside is waterproof and insulated, so a quick wipe with a damp cloth, or even a rinse for a bigger spill, and it would be good as new! It would not leak through and stain the outside of the bag!The front pocket has a stylish clasp that is magnetized. The magnet is quite strong, so it closes with no effort. The back pocket closes with velcro.The straps are made of a flexible shiny fabric, and are attached with nice quality metal clasps, so the bag and straps move with ease and are not stiff or hard to manage.In summary, this bag is super cute and stylish! It smacks of high quality materials. I can\u2019t wait for it to be available in more colors and patterns, and hopefully just a little bigger!",

                "reviewText": "Of all three the ladies' lunch bags I bought, this trumped all, because of the design and practicality.The shoulder strap is extremely handy and versatile. If you don't like shoulder strap, you can remove it and use the handles, but I like both of them.There are four outside pockets. The length-wise ones has two different closings: one has zipper which is great for wallet and phones, and the other has a magnetic button which is great for easy access. The side pockets has elastic band and are great to host your tumblers, sippy cups and cans.The interior has light color, similar to aluminum foil. This is great not only to appear clean, but also a great background color to reflect light and allow items to be easily identify (as opposed to the black interior.) The silverly interior als reflect the heat and cold back to the food and drink stored in the main compartment and maintain their desired temperature.I use this bag for road trip and always carry it into the gas station to refill my ice / water / hot water. I use it while performing outdoors to keep my cold drinks cold in the main compartment, and to put thermacell bug repellent gadget and my insulated tumbler on the side pocket.The bag appear quite small, but can accommodate a lot with its top zipper design. The shape stands well on the ground by itself. It does not collapse even when empty.The exterior has light water repelling fabric and is easy to clean. Same as the interior. It is upscale enough to carry to office for work, and versatile enough for outdoor endeavor such as outdoor concert, sports events, and impromptu picnic.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a lunch bag that would allow me to stack my bowls upright instead of them sitting in my bag sideways and leaking all over. This bag is so perfect! I debated on buying the normal size or the large size and went with the normal size. This bag is way bigger than a normal typical lunch bag. I'm not really sure why anyone would need the large size unless you plan on packing for 2+ meals. The entire inside is insulated- my food stays cold and if anything does leak (which since the bowls sit upright it doesn't happen) it's easy to clean up and does not leak through the bag. There is a side compartment on each side of the bag, which is a bit small, but perfect for condiments, granola bars, hot cocoa/tea bags, silverware. Both ends of the bag have compartments that can hold water bottles. Or in my case I use one side for a 24 ounce water bottle and the other side for my 24 ounce coffee mug. Both fit perfect and the material comes up high enough to hold them in place good. The handles are nice and strong and secured good. The bottom of the bag is slightly raised up with metal feet in each corner (so the bottom of your bag doesn't get dirty if you set it down). This is the absolute perfect lunch bag. And it's cute enough and functional enough to be used outside of being just a lunch bag too!",
