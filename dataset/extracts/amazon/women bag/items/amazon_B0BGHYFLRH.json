The contour of the bag itself makes it very natural to carry and doesn't add obvious bulk to the silhouette. I bought a plain black bag to make it as neutral and as possible and easy to camouflage, but that meant that it was hard to differentiate between the main body and the pocket of the bag's inside. I solved that by sewing on bright red bias tape; simple enough. Overall extremely satisfied with the versatility, aesthetic thoughtfulness, and feel (literal and metaphorical) of this product.",

I don\u2019t think it looks cheap and being thin is an advantage.A good value for the price, slightly over $10.",

This results in a lot of time wasted searching for stuff. That said, this bag holds a lot, doesn\u2019t stain easily, and goes with basically any outfit. It\u2019s held up very well through daily use and I haven\u2019t noticed any quality problems.",
