However it was a huge let down because the two middle sections aren\u2019t sewn into the bottom, so if you put something in the middle section, it\u2019ll just migrate to one of the other sections in the bag. It works if you are using it as a book bag I guess, because a book won\u2019t migrate out of it, but I was looking for an every day type of bag and this ain\u2019t it",

This is premium canvas and is extremely well-made and sturdy. There are multiple pockets that can hold a variety of items. The reinforced straps are really nice and the clips that hold them to the bag are very sturdy. The strap is adjustable to achieve your personal comfort. The handles also have a snapped cover to keep them together and provide carrying comfort. I am really impressed with the quality of this tote for the price.
