Love the shoulder strap it makes it so much easier to carry.I don\u2019t put it inside my work fridge I leave it in my car. It keeps things COOL but you have to use big ice packs two on the bottom for sure.",

I work 10 hour shifts at work with two half hour breaks and I have never felt like I didn\u2019t pack enough food, snacks, drinks with this bag in fact I feel I can always pack a little more than I expect to eat that day. The top part of this bag is perfect for utensils, condiments or a candy bar. I have used this bag everyday since I bought it with no problems with breakage of any kind, zippers still are perfect and straps hold my bigger packed lunches and snacks. I bought the pink colored bag and have been complimented on it quit a bit for a lunch bag.",

The insulation has kept my food fresh and the ample storage space has allowed me to pack everything I need for a long day at work.Overall, I highly recommend this lunch bag to anyone in need of a reliable and well-made bag for their daily lunch. With its great insulation and storage space, it is the perfect choice for anyone who values their food staying fresh and delicious throughout the day. So, I would rate it 4 stars.",
