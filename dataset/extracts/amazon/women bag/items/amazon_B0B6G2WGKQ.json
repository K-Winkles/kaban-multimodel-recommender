                "reviewText": "This bag is exactly what I was looking for. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality since it was so affordable.The main zipper runs smoothly and it's thicker than the average zipper, which I love.Inside the main pocket, there are mesh pockets on both sides, great for lip balm, tissues, anything small you'd like to keep separate.There is also an almost hidden zipper on the back as another pocket.The clip and strap are thick, comfortable and easy to adjust.I ordered the black. I'm going to purchase more colors soon.This bag is also regulation size for sporting events.I've been extremely happy with this bag.Lastly, I'd like to add that a friend of mine has the expensive Lululemon brand bag that looks and feels identical to this one. The difference only being the price and the logo on front.",

                "reviewText": "Women's Fanny Pak, Color: BlueI just received it and it's what I was hoping for. I can't speak to durability or water resistance, but it looks well made. The pack is lightweight nylon with good zippers. It has two pockets and a mesh divider in the larger pocket. The strap is on the wider/heavier end of fanny packs but it's soft & smooth woven and I like that for holding it in place. (As opposed to those with thin straps that slip up into your waist on one side and hang on the other.) I tried it on and it is lightweight while empty. There is plenty of room for phone, glasses, and money/cards. You could even over-fill it making it heavy. To carry more items you might want a crossbody-backpack hybrid. It works equally well around the waist or diagonally across one shoulder. It can fit tight enough so when active it won't fling around or dig into my shoulder like a crossbody bag. The belt & buckle are a plus for me, but the pack might be too heavy or bulky (with items) for long distance runners or too difficult to open the buckle for people with weak hands or fingers.I selected one that I hoped could work both for hiking or dressing nicer and walking around a city; it checked that box. I don't see any reason a man cannot wear it.",

After the brown one arrived and id used it a few days, i noticed that the black one was on sale and ordered it. These bags are a go to for numerous occasions from walking the dog to running errands or going for a walk. it fits everything you need and expands a fair amount if you add a few things along the way. I especially like the \"secret\" pocket against the body (good for cash or credit card) and the fact that it can be worn several different ways-cross body, around the waist, over the shoulder. I also like that the clasp is close to the bag as it feels more secure than old style waist bags with the clasp in the back.I wish it came in bright red...",
