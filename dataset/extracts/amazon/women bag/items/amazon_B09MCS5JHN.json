Love the large floral print on the outside, and love how huge the bag itself is - I could fit my laptop, charger, mouse, notebook, light sweater, water bottle, phone, wallet, snack, etc. very easily. The \u201cfabric\u201d on the inside feels thin and plastic-y (not really like textile fabric, more like a low quality poncho type material?) but I\u2019m the only one who sees/uses that so not a big deal to me as long as the pockets hold up well over time. And there are plenty of pockets and pen holder loops! The two handles are a great length on the longest setting, so it\u2019s easy to get the bag up onto your shoulder with just one hand. I didn\u2019t use the single detachable shoulder strap that came with it. Have only used the bag for the one trip thus far, so don\u2019t have much feedback on durability yet, but it worked very well for my needs and I felt fabulous carrying it. :)",

The only reason I am not giving it a full five stars is that after a while it starts to lean a little more to one side and I try to evenly distribute the weight to the front and back pockets. I love the pattern and it has been great as my work bag to carry all of my essentials in.",

I am a childrens pastor and a full time student getting my masters. So having a bad that was functional for both usually meant I had to use a backpack. That\u2019s not always the best look professionally so when I got the laptop cover I found this bag. It so perfectly made. It\u2019s beautiful and elegant. Plenty of room for school and work in one bag. I promise you won\u2019t regret it. \u2764\ufe0f",
