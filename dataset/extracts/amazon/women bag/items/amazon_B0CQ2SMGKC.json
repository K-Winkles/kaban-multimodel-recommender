                "reviewText": "After looking at probably 50 different carry-on bags, I decided on this one because it's more attractive than most and none of the reviews mentioned problems with the zippers. This is a very stylish bag, and it's well made--strong seams and hardware, sturdy zippers. It has just enough pockets to stash lots of small items you need en route, but not so many that you'll have to search for anything. The lighter colored lining makes it easy to find things, too. The shoulder strap is adjustable and comfortable.The size was just right for me. The bag held my laptop, a change of clothes, snacks, a windbreaker jacket, a book, a water bottle, a fairly large 35mm camera and lens, and a pair of shoes--and that was without being anywhere close to needing to use the bottom expansion feature. On the way to my destination, I used this as my carry-on bag (I had checked luggage). On the way home, I had additional items to pack and rather than overload my checked suitcase, I just expanded the bottom of this bag so I could redistribute my belongings--and I was still nowhere near filling it. I once again used this as a carry-on bag, which allowed me to use a small backpack as my personal item.During my trip, my bag got a lot of use and it got knocked around a bit, but it held up just fine. Considering the cream color, I expected the bag to get filthy, but it actually stayed quite clean. I'm really impressed with this bag and I only regret I didn't find it sooner for previous trips. As for the low price? I am shocked at what an exceptional value this is. I didn't expect to get something of this quality at that price.",

It's the perfect size to fit everything you want in your carry on. Love how it fits on the handle of your suitcase too. It's very easy to fold back into the compact size again. The material seems kind of moisture wicking? As well. And it has soooo many pockets and I looove how many different pockets there are so I can organize things in different compartments. Perfect for travel or just holding all of your belongings~",
