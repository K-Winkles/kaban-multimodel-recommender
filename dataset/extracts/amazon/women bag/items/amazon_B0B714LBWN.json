This allows me to carry my stuff very comfortably around my waste without being as bulky as fanny packs. I also like to wear sweats and gym shorts that are easily dragged down by a phone and wallet. This is a great fix. Fits my 40\" waist with a couple inches to spare. Very light and comfortable. Holds my wallet, Pixel 6 phone, keys, earbuds, glasses, ink pen, with a little room to spare (about 70% full). This is ideal for me. It is made surprisingly well for the money. Well built, very nice and smooth zippers. The strap is very comfortable too against the body. Not rough or rigid.",

I think the strap could be a little bit longer, but it fit me just right. If you have a larger torso/breasts, it might be a little bit snug. I also would like to see different interior color options, but the outside material feels durable and so far the pockets inside have held up! I also really liked the back zipper for my credit cards and passes, and I didn\u2019t have to worry about them falling out while I was getting Chapstick or my phone out.",

                "reviewText": "I had my eye on a belt bag for a while. I chose this one due to the good reviews. It is a great belt bag. Just big enough but not too big. I may exchange for a different color though. The blush/pink is just a bit too much for me. It has good compartments. Occasionally the zipper is a little harder to pull. Like I feel like I need to be careful with it but it seems quality enough. Would recommend!!",

It\u2019s a good size for holding my essentials when I\u2019m out doing something active and need my hands free. Cute little somewhat-dupe for the Lulu waist bag!",
