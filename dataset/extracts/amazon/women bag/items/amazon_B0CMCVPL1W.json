                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars LOVE this bag!",
                "reviewText": "The first thing that caught my eye about this bag was the beautiful green color - soft but not like a mint green or sage tone - it's a perfect green. Even the strap has a shiny sheen to it that compliments the color of the bag but has a different texture. It is easy to carry over your arm like in the crook of your elbow, or on your shoulder, or even cross-body which is my preferred way to wear this one. It holds way more stuff than I need to carry at one time so I have to discipline myself that less is more. It is a good choice to carry to the gym, the beach, or on a day trip - in other words, times that I tend to need more items in my purse than on a normal day.The fabric is a sort of nylon so while I wouldn't call it waterproof, I don't have to worry about rain or other water ruining the fabric, and it is quick drying I've noticed. Several people at my church and gym commented on how pretty it is - I think it's the color that made them notice it - it is different from the usual purses I carry and the color makes it stand out. My only critique is that it does not completely close across the top. While there is a \"buckle-snap\" type closure that pulls the sides together, there is not a zipper that goes all the way across the top of the bag. Unless you plan to turn it upside down and shake it, you should be fine :) One last thing, even though it is a casual nylon bag, it somehow seems to go with everything, just as a neutral color would. Would love to have it in at least one other color before they stop selling it.",

                "reviewText": "Although this bag is so roomy that I\u2019ll probably end up carrying way more things than I need to, I love everything about it so far. The \u201cgreen\u201d is a very versatile soft green, maybe a shade of celery? I like that there are two options for carrying the bag: short, padded handles, or a seatbelt type of strap for shoulder or crossbody wear. The inside is super spacious but has a large zip pocket that divides the bag into two large sections, each of which have pockets of their own. The bottom is padded to give it some structure (not a lot). In the photos, I\u2019m carrying my iPad in the bag that made it look a little deformed from the weight of it, but I wouldn\u2019t normally carry a single flat item that\u2019s so heavy. The only thing I maybe don\u2019t love about it is that the strap is quite long, even when it\u2019s shortened all the way. This means that when I drape it across the back of a chair at a restaurant, it touches \u2014 or almost touches \u2014 the ground. I\u2019ve tied a knot in the strap to shorten it for this purpose. Not ideal, but no big deal. I think this casual, everyday bag is a great value for the price and will be using it on the days when I need to carry stuff for the fam and not just my keys, wallet and phone.",

However, I find i don't grab this bag as often as some of my others for two reasons:It's slouches so when it isn't filled (which it usually isn't FILLED), it falls and bunches. I now know I like more structure to my bags.Secondly, the tapered top makes the top opening not real big. I didn't realize how much of a nuisance that is. Ug. When I go to reach for something it almost hides in the bottom and sides.Nothing wrong with the bag just my preferences.",

                "reviewText": "This is my fault I guess I didn\u2019t read the listing throughly. The tote bag is nice and very larger but what I didn\u2019t like was the material. It\u2019s a windbreaker material and it actually makes noise when you move like those old track suits. It will hold a lot for sure but it drives me nuts and I don\u2019t care for it. I can\u2019t say I\u2019d recommend this bag it\u2019s got to much working against it.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a bag to have in the back seat of my car to hold my jacket, cardigan, etc. that I like to have on hand - this bag is perfect - it does not stand up on its own, which is fine - it has a snap-type closure on top so it is easy to reach behind my seat and grab what I need around the closure - it is a breathable material that should work well in the car - recommend this bag",

It's plush and adorable looking, and the color is exactly as shown. My only concern is that the material may get dirty quickly, but have not confirmed that as of yet. So far, it's been a great addition to my big boho bag collection.",

It has served me well during a few flights already.However, the overall quality feeling could\u2019ve been better. I know it\u2019s a replica of well known L brand, but still doesn\u2019t justify the cheap look (I do have another one from a different seller and it\u2019s much more impressive)",
