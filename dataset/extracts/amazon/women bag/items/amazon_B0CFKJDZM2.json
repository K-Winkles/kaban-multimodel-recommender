                "reviewText": "I have been using a carry bag for my gym needs, and I can never find what I am looking for. I saw this Gym Bag for Women, and thought it would work for me. I LOVE this gym bag! It is very attractive, holds more than I will ever carry, has a secure spot for my water bottle, two outside pockets and an outside zipper pocket to keep items safe. It will hold a second water bottle securely. I can use the handle that also fits on my shoulder, or attach the shoulder carry strap. Inside the waterproof zipper pocket holds worn gym clothes, there are two other pockets and an extremely roomy interior. Another fabulous feature is the shoe compartment on the bottom of the bag totally separate from the inside with two air vents. But wait...there's more! This gym bag comes with a matching wristlet bag with an amazing jewelry zipper pocket. Items can be safely held in place with a number of features: 3 elastic loops, four elastic pouch slots, a snap strap that will hold 15 post earrings or small pins and 4 other snap loops for other items. The inside is roomy with two mesh pockets. The wristlet strap can be disconnected from the bag. With all these positive features, this gym bag is light. This bag is strong, attractive and easy to use and it easily fits into the gym locker. The warranty and 2 year extended warranty for registering this gym bag is extremely generous and speaks to the quality of this item.",

This is the second or third Maelstrom product that I buy. Have a lunch bag that was a replacement for a another lunch bag that was stolen; all three have been really good. A good zipper function; long shoulder strap, and easily holds two days worth of clothing inside the main compartment, along with your shaving kit.",
