My phone, sunglasses, and meds in the middle pocket, and misc hair ties, bobby pins, and cruise room key in the small front zipper pocket. My candy wrappers and receipts got stuffed in the non-zipper pocket. Even with all of those items, there was plenty of room to spare in the two big pockets for car keys, portable phone charger, small cords, etc.Friends on my trip commented on how handy and cute it was, and I in turn replied, \"I got it on Amazon super cheap. Love it!\" - of course. I wore it on my front and back through the trip, as needed. From traveling alone to tan lines, I appreciated the versatility of switching where it was on my body.It is admittedly what you get for the price. Although it held up fine for my trip, the overall material does *feel* cheap.",

                "reviewText": "Update - I hate this bag. I used it today when I went to the casino and it\u2019s such a pain in the butt and so awkward that the zippers zip to the wrong side. Plus the strap dug into my neck pretty bad. I guess I needed to tighten it more too because it kept slipping and falling to my side. For such a slim bag, I kept bumping it into the chairs as i was pulling out/pushing in the chairs. It was the weirdest thing. How can there be a learning curve with a bag? It looked like I was wearing a sling for a broken arm. Sling bags are NOT for me. Too bad.I'm torn on this bag. It's $10 so how much can I really complain. I think some of the pictures are deceiving because they show the bag being worn to the right or left. I bought the black bag with the gold zippers, and it can only be worn to the right (over my left shoulder, sitting on my right hip area). If I try to wear it to the left, the strap flips around and then the bag flips around so the back of the bag faces out. I also agree with another reviewer that the zippers seem to be on the wrong side. The bag is really cute and it's a great size and I LOVE that my phone fits in the open pocket in the front, but the bag is just awkward to wear. It would be nice if the strap was able to be worn on either side and I wish the zippers could work on either side too. BUT again, it's $10 and for $10 it's a great bag. I'm going to keep it. Maybe I'll get used to wearing it.Also, just want to mention that the strap is very long. I\u2019m a size 20 and the strap still had plenty of room to extend beyond what I needed.",

Even though it's not exactly the same, this is a great alternative to a traditional purse. The colours are vibrant a cute, there's slots in the side of the bag for wires to come through if you want to store your phone and listen to music, or if you wanted to connect to a battery pack in the bag. The strap is adjustable and suitable for plus-sized people to use without it sitting at a weird place on your body. The bag itself has 5 compartments, including one on the back for more important items, and the main compartment is big enough to fit my wallet, which a friend once referred to as a briefcase. 0 complaints, great little big for day trips",
