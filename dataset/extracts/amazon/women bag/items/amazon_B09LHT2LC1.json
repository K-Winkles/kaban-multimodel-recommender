The color is beautiful and I received plenty of compliments. I even shared the purchase info with a stranger as we entered into the plane. Only downside is that the bag is heavy without much in it due to quality material; therefore at capacity it is pretty weighty. Still 5 stars for me.",

Lately a laptop has been added to this amount so I needed a bag that could accommodate both my personal and my business \"stuff\". I love the exterior tooled leather look and I picked the green. To me, it looks like an expensive bag! I love the sturdiness and the fact that it doesn't collapse in a heap making it easy to find what I need without empting all the contents. The straps can be lengthened to a persons taste. It holds my laptop and power cords plus the other \"stuff\" I mentioned and the three inner partitions stay upright and don't sag. The center is a zip pocket. The magnetic closures work well unless you overstuff. The only \"con\" I've seen is it's a little heavy even when it's empty. This may be the trade off for the durability so I can handle that. Bottom line is....this bag is about as close as I've come to perfect but I'm still not giving it 5 stars but I would give it 4.5 if I could!",
