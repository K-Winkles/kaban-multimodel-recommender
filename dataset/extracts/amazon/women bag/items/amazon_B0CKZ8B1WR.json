The insulated main pouch is nice for keeping cold things cold. A small ice pack would probably be enough to keep it cool for a few hours if refrigeration wasn\u2019t accessible. I think the piping at the top of the pouch could be sewn a little better though. There was only one reverse stitch about a half inch away from the end, and the stitching after it was loose and came out. I hope that single reverse stitch hold up, but for the price I suppose its worth a shot. The colors (purple in my case) in the photos are fairly accurate.",
