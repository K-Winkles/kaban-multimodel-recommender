After 2 times putting it in and taking it out, and filling the rest of the bag, it fit a lot better. Now I love it. I got it in black, but will be getting it in more colors. Very happy with it. Nice quality. Good compartments",

I really can't say anything bad about it other than, again, with the other bag I got from Amazon. It looked like it had a lot of space vs than what it does.It's for a 15.6 laptop. Mine's 14. It's tight and it's hard to close because the laptop is touching the zipper.I have a case on my laptop as most should. It has nice slots to put other things in it, but I really am not able to other than my phone and the wires and that is even harder to close.So, IDK, I have another laptop bag that's bigger and it's nice. But, this 1 is lighter and you can actually put in on your shoulder, or use the strap. With mine you can't. If I keep it, I may just use it to go to Starbucks and not zipper it shut so I can put my cards and phone in it along with the wires.But we'll see. It's very cute and I love the little bow.Now, I'm weak, so this may be a weak person's issue. It took a lot for me to open the gold latch the bow is on, to put it on the bag. LOL Again, I'm weak, so it could just be me and tbh, that's good it was hard in away because you know, it's not going to easily come off.I have time to think about it. I'm going to try it out this week and see. If I keep it, I'll update.",
