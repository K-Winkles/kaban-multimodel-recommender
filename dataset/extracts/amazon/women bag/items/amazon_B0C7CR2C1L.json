Although I am retired, we travel a lot and I wanted a soft type of small cooler to use for picnics, snacks, etc. I previously had a hard type (playmate) but it didn\u2019t hold enough and took up too much storage room. This one came in several colors but I got the cute black and white one so I can spot it easily. I love the size, two mesh side pockets for drinks and the 2 zippers. We took it for a weekend trip to hold our fruit, sandwiches and drinks and used a blue ice pack on bottom. It was great. I also love that it is lightweight and I can carry it by its handle or shoulder strap. I can wipe it clean too. Great value.",

                "reviewText": "The quality of this product is not bad. It\u2019s not a high end product and I didn\u2019t pay the high end price. It does the job of keeping the stuff (food) cold or hot but not for too long.It feels smaller when I use it. The measurements provided by the shipper feels off (I have not measured it).I have spilled liquid and food inside couple of times and it was very easy to clean.I am making off 1 star bcoz of the size. Little bigger size could have helped.This is just my opinion.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this lunchbox in small gray for my 8 th grader and we both love it. It\u2019s very well made, large interior and looks very clean and classy. It fits his food thermos, juice box, and several snacks with room to spare. The zipped interior pocket is great for some paper towel and utensils. Nice and sturdy net pocket on the side is great for small water bottle! It has a nice padded shoulder strap but my son prefers to carry it by the top handle. Awesome lunchbox!",
