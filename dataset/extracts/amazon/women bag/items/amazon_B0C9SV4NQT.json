                "reviewText": "I had very particular wants in a gym bag - it needed to have a separate shoe compartment, an adjustable shoulder strap, and a wet compartment. Most importantly, it needed to be small - I don\u2019t carry that much, but most of the bags with a shoe compartment are huge, so it\u2019s been a process to find one that ticked all the boxes.This bag is great - it\u2019s small and compact, has very nice detailing in the fabric and shiny metal hardware & zippers. The main (larger) compartment has a big zippered pocket and smaller slip pockets inside, and is where the shoe pocket is contained from the outside, so if you have shoes in the shoe pocket, naturally that would take up some of the space. Again, not an issue for me personally. The 2nd compartment has a (presumably waterproof, I haven\u2019t tried pouring water in it to see if it holds) lining. I usually put my water bottle in that side in case it leaks. It\u2019s not a huge pocket and I doubt it\u2019s large enough to hold a towel, but would definitely hold a wet bathing suit, washcloth, or shampoo bottles.There\u2019s also a slip pocket outside (would be nice if it were zippered, but that\u2019s ok). Some details I\u2019ve seen on other bags that would make this even better would be a mesh outside pocket on one end, the outside pocket to be zippered, and a tab to keep the hand straps together, but these are small. All in all, I\u2019m really happy with this bag and highly recommend!",

It\u2019s cut and well made but it\u2019s more of a size that of what a child would use and too small for an adult. See pictures, once you put in a pair of shoes in shoe compartment. You are not left with much room to put a change of clothes which is the only reason I\u2019m returning to look for something a little bigger.",
