                "reviewText": "This bag works great if you are trying to find a simple bag to hold all of your necessities for a game or concert at a stadium. It easily meets stadium guidelines and is easy to style and wear. It has enough space to hold your phone, wallet, key, sunglasses, and a few smaller items and it has a zipper pouch on the from that can hold a few smaller items as well. It\u2019s easy to carry and can be worn over the shoulder or cross body which is nice and it was fairly comfortable. If it\u2019s hot out or if you are in short sleeves the strap could get a little itchy but if you are in a spot where you could take it off when you get to your seat you should be okay comfort wise. The plastic is a little sticky and can kind of suction together when you first use it so I would recommend taking something and trying to stretch the plastic a little before first use",

                "reviewText": "I needed a clear purse for a Pink concert at a stadium, and it was perfect. Big enough for items I needed at the concert but small enough that I could put it on my shoulder across my body to my hip and not worry about it. The strap was easy to adjust. The zippers worked fine. And the small pocket on the front of the purse allowed me to put small items where I could easily get them. The ushers at the stadium let me in with no problem.",
