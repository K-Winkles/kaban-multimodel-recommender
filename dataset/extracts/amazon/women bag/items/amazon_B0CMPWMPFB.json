                "reviewText": "There is a lot of room and pockets to organize everything including a laptop and the interior fabric is soft and not too crazy thin. The exterior is just as shown and expected. While it's all fairly stiff (which is good thing), as you can see in the video of the product in the description, there are a few minor lines from the cardboard or stiff material that is underneath the outer material that are slightly apparent. It's minor though. The thing that does win me over is the handles are very well done and stitched very securely and they look and feel sturdy. That goes a long way. The gold hardware on this is as expected for this price point but I think will hold up nicely. The bow is a cute touch and can be clipped on or off. A really nice gift for a teacher (or in my case a principal) in your life. It's a nice solid professional look that means business!",

Inserting it and removing the laptop from the bag takes just a little patience. We expect the bag will stretch a bit and it will be fine but it is supposed to hold a 15.6 laptop and it just barely does. Otherwise the bag is super nice and my wife loves it. Plenty of pockets and has a definite leather feel land look to it making it look much more expensive. My wife likes it and said she would buy it even with it being a little tight. She hates laptop backpacks and already carries her laptop in a purse type bag but it is not made for a laptop so this will be her go to in the future.",

This green goddess bag is standing out and even has a pretty green bow to take it over the top with classy professionalism. This bag should have 20 stars.",

The inside has a plethora of pockets and dividers and has a nice suede feeling interior. This is going to be great to carry my laptop in for my meetings. It is so much more fashionable than the typical laptop tote bag. It definitely looks designer and I highly recommend. My only wish is that it came in a box or something to prevent it from getting compressed because it does have impressions from the handles on both sides. I'm hoping they go away with use.",
