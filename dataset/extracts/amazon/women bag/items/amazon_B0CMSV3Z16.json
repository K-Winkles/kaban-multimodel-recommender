                "reviewText": "This bag was for an older lady who has to carry various things around with her that won't fit in a smaller bag but who doesn't always want to carry the Big Luggage purse. There are so few that are large enough for a big cell phone and additional items yet not massive shoulder bags, or are not too small or clutch style. She wanted a small Go-bag with a shoulder strap. This size is exactly that and seems well made too. The only downsides are that the top is not a zipper but a snap so if you drop it or knock it over it will spill smaller items instantly. Also, it's a corduroy type fabric, so while it feels nice to touch,it won't be much in a downpour (also that slightly ajar zipperless top will let rain in). So it's a great summer purse in a hard to find size and will last pretty well. It also has clutch handles for quick grabbing when getting up or down.",

                "reviewText": "Overall- a very nice purse/bag for the price. It almost feels like a corduroy material.This is where I went wrong- I did not spray my bag with any material protectant spray to prevent and keep from stains or dark spots. HOWEVER- I did travel through TSA multiple times and multiple airports and planes with this bag and it is still very clean besides one spot, so I'd say it holds up to its color extremely well. It fit all the nececities on my flights: wallet, keys, gum, portable chargers, makeup bag, hair brush, headphones, all at once. Which actually surprised me. I would buy this bag again actually",

The only this is the strap is not long enough to wear it like a cross bag if that makes sense so you will probably have to carry it with your hands I would recommend you purchase this!",
