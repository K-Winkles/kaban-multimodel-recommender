                "reviewText": "I fell in love with the unusual blue green color of this bag. It is every bit as wonderful of a color in person as it looks on the web. The bag is an ideal size for a small laptop and a couple other items. (Note that if you want to also carry a bulky wallet and a couple books and a makeup bag, this may be a tad too small to use without creating potentially damaging bulges in the side of the bag. But if you just want to carry a few not-too-bulky items, this is perfect. It can also work well as a tote for around town. My only disappointment is that based on the headline, I thought I was getting a leather bag. I prefer real leather to PU leather--this bag is made of PU material. Had I read all the fine print below the header, I would have realized that (mentioning this in case others assume this is leather, based on the bold caption for this item). My leather bag arrived with the tips bent inwards--I think it was poorly packed. I'm hoping I can keep bending them and slowly get them back into place so that the tips on the top and bottom look nicer. All the zippers work well and there are a lot of interior compartments, including a laptop tag on the laptop strap indicating what it is for (useful). I'd rate this slightly below a 4, due to the tips being bent inwards because of how it was packed at the manufacture site (the box had no damage). If that were not the case, the rating would be higher, since the color is so beautiful and unusual.",

                "reviewText": "This bag is sleek, stylish, and fits everything I need for my workday, so I don't even need a purse. The handles and hardware are sturdy and adjustable. The shoulder strap is redundant for me, since I just sling the two handles over my shoulder, but it is detachable and adjustable as well, and has a nylon lining on the shoulder side for comfort when carrying. I like this because it has everything! Nice color, good manufacturing, many pockets. It's the best job board! I totally recommend it.",
