Its largest compartment can fit a couple of paddles and even another one in the next smaller compartment (if you don\u2019t mind that paddle handle sticks out). Room for balls as well. It has enough other compartments for smaller stuff like keys, wallet, phone, etc. The carrying strap is just for over a single shoulder, so won\u2019t work as two shoulder backpack style. However, my wife has that kind and I actually prefer this bag over hers. Also has a hook for hanging on a fence.Can\u2019t speak to it\u2019s durability since I\u2019ve only had it for a month, but noticed another reviewer who said it was holding up after 1.5 years. It\u2019s a good one!",

Would have rated higher, but thought there was going to be more structure to the bag. It does what I need and I would recommend.",
