                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a large black tote bag, and it has exceeded all of my expectations! Initially, I was apprehensive that the 'large' size would be too much, but to my delight, it's the perfect size for everyday use. Although it's marketed as a \"Women Tote Bag,\" its sleek and minimalist design lends itself to a unisex appeal, making it a versatile choice for anyone.As a nursing student gearing up for core classes, I needed a bag that could handle the load. This tote has been a game-changer. It comfortably holds two standard-sized binders, BP cuffs, a pencil case, toiletries, a planner, and still has room to spare for additional books or a change of clothes. The added convenience of two pockets for water bottles and a small external pocket for frequently accessed items like keys and ID makes it incredibly functional for busy days.In summary, this tote is a fantastic find, especially considering the price. Its capacity, style, and utility make it a 10/10 for me, and I'm already considering purchasing another one. Highly recommended for students or anyone in need of a reliable bag!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this as a work tote to just carry my laptop, wallet, keys, makeup, books, notepads, etc.It works well for the price. It's lightweight and durable, the bag strap doesn't hurt my shoulder even when holding on to for longer periods since the bag in general even with a laptop stored inside is super lightweight. I feel like you can carry a decent amount in here and it still feel light. It also has a zipper on top which is nice for extra security.The size of the bag is a little interesting. It isn't tall. The width fits my 15in macbook perfectly but the bag looks much more rectangular since width is longer than the height, so I think it's a little bit awkwardly shaped. Kind of reminds me of a gym bag where the width is long, height short, just interestingly shaped.. I think if they made the height just a tad bit longer it wouldn't look as awkward, but that's very minor for what I use it for. There's a laptop pocket/section within the bag but it's a little flimsy. The divider has two pockets on it as well which was a nice touch to store my keys and cardholder as well as other things like makeup.It works very well for work. I would not choose to use it outside of work though because it's not as stylish as I imagined it to be.",

The bag is the perfect size. Not too big and not too small. The outside material is like parachute pants. Water will bounce right off. It's sturdy and well made. It has 3 nice pockets inside. 1 zipped. There is a separation inside, which I like because I travel with a folder that carries my vouchers and tickets that some international countries that have not upgraded electronically still use. The folder fits nicely inside. I can put my purse, and other essentials on the other side of the separation. It also zips closed which protects from pickpockets on trains, airports, and ferries. Love this bag.",

It is such a beautiful bag and the quality is so much better than I could ask for. It fits an insane amount of stuff inside, from my stethoscope to massive textbooks and there is still heaps of space left. I love that it has a lot of pockets too so I can keep everything organised. Considering buying the black one too now because I think it would make such a good daily tote regardless of what you need it for. Very happy with the purchase. \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f",
