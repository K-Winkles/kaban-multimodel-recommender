                "reviewText": "I had to grow up and buy an adult lunch box. So I ended up with this one. This lunch bag has a beautiful and stylish floral design that would be appealing to many women. The insulation is effective in keeping food at the desired temperature, whether hot or cold, for an extended period of time. This makes it suitable for carrying a variety of foods, including sandwiches, salads, fruits, and snacks.The adjustable shoulder strap is a great feature, as it allows the bag to be carried comfortably and hands-free, which is especially helpful for those who need to carry other items or who have a long commute to work or school. The strap is also sturdy and well-made, ensuring that it can hold the weight of the contents of the bag without breaking or slipping.Another benefit of this lunch bag is its leakproof design, which helps to prevent any spills or leaks from getting on clothing or other items in the bag. The bag also has a spacious interior with a variety of pockets for organizing and separating different items.In terms of construction, the lunch bag is well-made with high-quality materials, including a durable and easy-to-clean fabric exterior. The zippers are also of good quality and work smoothly, making it easy to access the contents of the bag.",

                "reviewText": "I took my time looking for the perfect lunch bag, and this is it. It is big enough for a bento box, water bottles, my bamboo utensils and more. It's really pretty, too. I can use the strap to sling across my shoulder, or carry it handbag style. It's insulated too, so with a small freezer block everything stays cold. Great buy and affordable price.",

                "reviewText": "I was needing a bigger lunch bag for work with me working 12hrs and a more insulated bag. I do not use ice blocks so I cannot fully say for quality of keeping it that cold but with my regular refrigerated stuff it did a great job keeping it cold. I may have just seen an example of another style or size of this bag but thought it could convert into a back pack like design but mine doesnt which I am ok with cause it would be too big then. I accidentally spilled some applesauce in there one night and it was super easy to clean. I love how nice it is and it could hold 12 cans of soda for sure. I love it alot and love the different design options. Great for the price and quality.",

It comes with an additional longer strap for easy adjustable carrying as well! It\u2019s insulated well and the material feels like it\u2019s good quality and I think it will be durable - the only problem I have with it is on my bag it looks like part of the outer lining was missed by the stitching on the top front edge. Otherwise I think it\u2019s a lovely product!",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s cute, it\u2019s spacious, it stays cold with my ice packs, and it does the job well. There is a seam that I have to push out of the way to zip it, but the two zipper design allows me to use the other side that the seam lays flatter and doesn\u2019t interfere with closure. There is a back zipper pocket that holds things like drink mix packets, a badge, chapstick, pens that you may need/want for work but don\u2019t need to store inside with your lunch. There are mesh pockets either side, however, with it packed and an 8oz bottle of water on one side I couldn\u2019t get my 12oz pop in the other. Certainly not a deal breaker for this little stylish lunch bag. After 3 usages I\u2019ve not had any leakage, so cleaning has been a non-issue other than a quick swipe with a disinfectant after each use.",
