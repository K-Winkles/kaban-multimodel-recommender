                "reviewText": "I do a lot of hiking in the summer and I pack a lunchbox cooler to keep in the car with snacks and cold drinks for the drive home. I've been lugging around an old cooler that does the job, but lacks a lot of the features this cooler has.The side pockets are convenient for silverware, extra paper towels, protein bars and small items you need to stash quickly (like my point and shoot camera). All the extra storage and separation features of this lunchbox make it easy to pack and keep foods that need to be chilled all in one place.I prefer to pack my food in glass containers, not plastic Tupperware, but glass is bulky and takes up a lot of space. I was worried I wouldn't be able to fit everything inside of this cooler, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it has plenty of extra room for everything I need.This lunchbox cooler looks nice. I purchased the black one, and I really like how stylish it is. It's not awkward or embarrassing to carry around. The zippers are easy to use, no issues with durability yet. I do try to take good care of my belongings though, and will be mindful of how I use this in an effort to prolong its life.I appreciate the handles, and the shoulder strap. One complaint: I wish there was an option to fasten the handles together (like a velcro or button strap). Sometimes the handles flop around and can be hard to grab ahold of. Otherwise, this is perfect for carrying all of your food and snacks for travel, long days in the car and for post-hike refreshments.",

                "reviewText": "I use this every day for my leftover lunches and I've yet to fill the thing. It's got more room than I think I'll ever need for a lunch - and I'd wager it would work just fine if you wanted to take a six-pack on ice and some snacks to the beach. It's that roomy. The front pocket holds everything from keys to an extra sandwich. The side mesh pockets are kind of shallow so I don't put water bottles in there (the one time I did, it blooped out) but they work well for snacks like a breakfast bar or an apple. No complaints on the space.The only drawback is that the sides are not firm in the sense that the lunchbox kind of lops over. The sides don't have the firmness to just stand on their own. The advantage of that is you can squash it down for storage if you really needed but the disadvantage is when the sides squish while you're trying to get stuff from inside of it. That's more of an irritant than a legit defect but since it ends up irritating me a little bit each day, it's worth mentioning.It does have several sets of zippers so you just have to keep track of what you're trying to open. The fabric seems very durable and it does a solid job keeping my leftovers cool without ice packs until I can get into work and put food in the fridge there (~40 min drive).",
