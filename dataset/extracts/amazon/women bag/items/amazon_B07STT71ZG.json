This happens to be a great buy with size and compartments. The top flap with a zippered compartment. Listen, dont let that flap fool you there is soooo much room in that little flap, my items almost got lost in there :-D. I think its perfect for everyday normal wear and great price. I look forward to getting maybe 2 more colors in the near future.",

My wallet fits into it perfectly so there\u2019s no need to switch my cash and cards, and I can fit my iPhone, car keys, and a few other items. I like the look and overall I think it\u2019ll be good for my purpose. I wasn\u2019t looking to spend a lot of money and I like the fold over zip top to create more security. Only negative is that the item shipped directly in a plastic shipping wrapper so if I did need to return it, there\u2019s no actual product barcode and it came with a warranty card, and when I tried to enter my info on the site, it could not locate my order. Overall it\u2019ll serve my purpose and it was a great price.",

I like that the flap pocket is perfect for feminine items so they are kept separate from the rest of your stuff. There is a large back pocket for a phone. It looks well made and more expensive that it really is. My only complaint is the lining is dark brown and basic looking. The only thing that would make this better would be a higher quality lining. It\u2019s just a bit boring. I definitely would have paid more for a nicer lining. Still, it\u2019s a great bag and my daughter saw it and immediately wanted one! This would make a great gift!",

I like the purse but not when you can only use it for a few weeks. Unfortunately, I did not start using it right away after I bought it and now the return window is closed.
