In all my travel years (plenty), this is the BEST toiletry bag I ever have purchased and I\u2019ve had plenty of experience searching. I like it so much, I ordered a second just to keep in storage because, if I ever have to replace this one, I want to be sure the same product is available.",

It seemed to hold quite a bit, I had one pocket for make up, one for my 3 ounces of liquids, one for medication and another for miscellaneous. Even though I had it stuffed quite full it did fold up nicely and fit well in my backpack. Only reason I did not give it a five is because of the flimsy hook, it seems like it will probably break pretty easily at some point. The outside looks very nice and the pink color is not too bright.",

Upon opening the bag I saw that it was covered in dirt and mold spores. (I can confirm these are mold spores because this happened to an old pair of shoes of mine a few years ago). Really disappointed, I will be returning :(",
