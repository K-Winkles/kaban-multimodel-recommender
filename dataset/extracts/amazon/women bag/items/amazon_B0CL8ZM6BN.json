Instead of sitting in the middle, the laptop sleeve is positioned against one side which leaves plenty of room for bulkier extras. Nice feature to also have the trolley sleeve turn into an outside pocket. I tried a lot of different bags - from inexpensive to not so. This one met all my requirements at a good price.

There are a handful of compartments in the interior, the front & sides. I like that because it helps to organize. There is a section in the interior that is padded just for the laptop. At first I didn\u2019t think this was an important feature but it is quite useful to keep the laptop and paperwork separate. There is a zipper on top, some other totes do not have this safety feature. The handle drop is a perfect size for carrying either over the shoulder or by hand.The material is sturdy and not flimsy. It\u2019s a strong bag.Second, I like the style. It\u2019s black. Black matches everything I carry. The material is mostly matte. So it falls perfectly into the background to any other accessory.Although not a deciding factor but of mention, I\u2019ve always been partial to the Chanel-inspired quilt pattern. Quiet but stylish.I love my new computer tote. I\u2019m very happy with my purchase.",

The pocket to slip onto my suitcase is great because I travel so much, and the bag fits everything I need. Laptop, water bottle, audition binder, it\u2019s awesome! Really great for university students!",

It is a quilted material so easy enough to clean. Just wish it had another outside pocket and another pocket on the inside. I use mine for work but you could easily take it traveling. Nice bag.",
