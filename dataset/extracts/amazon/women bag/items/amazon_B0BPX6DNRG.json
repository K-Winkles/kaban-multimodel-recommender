Top zipper opens with a rigid bar that protects your computer but also holds the bag open when you are putting things in and taking them out. Side pockets can hold a travel mug securely. High quality material and great colors match any style.",

                "reviewText": "This is my new \"everything\" bag! It is great for work, for a weekend trip, or packing up for a full-day outing. I I love the number and arrangement of pockets--not too many, but enough for everything I need, and very secure. The main compartment pops open or closed when the zipper is open, which is very convenient when working and reaching for items still in the bag. The bag stands solidly upright, a feature many similar bags lack. The handles and backpack straps are both very comfortable. On top of all of this, the bag looks great! I've received many compliments on it.",

                "reviewText": "The backpack is great for air travel and train travel. I could fit it under the seat, the bag has many pockets, and it fits a laptop. The USB is slow to charge and it didn't work for me because I needed my phone to be charged immediately, I had to charge my device somewhere else. I love the feature that I was able to put my coat with the handle straps while traveling and I didn't have to carry it. The back strap is a plus since I was able to attach it to the suitcase handle and keep going without having to put the backpack on my back. This helps me a lot since I have serious back problems and carrying things on my back is painful especially if the backpack is heavy. My family members love the backpack and even carry it for a while. It's a beautiful bag.",

However, this bag deserves a review. I was very surprised at the quality of this bag for the price...so well made. It looks super professional and is as functional as they come. I am a nursing student and needed a bag for class, clinicals and eventually for my nursing job and this checks all the boxes. Plenty of room, waterproof, sturdy, professional, its the total package. I will no doubt be purchasing more of their bags in the future. Buy this bag, you won't be disappointed.",

I work in a manufacturing auto factory thats rather big and they provide backpacks for our belongings we may need while at work and ease of carrying those belongings distances. The bag is ok but I needed something that held my contents better and was easily accessible. This bag has provided that. Its comfortable to carry long distance, it appears sturdy, and I can fit more in it better then the one they provided. I can access all the contents in it easier and faster without digging around or having to remove stuff to locate what I'm looking for. This bag has a place for 2 water bottles that fits various sizes as well as a charging port that can connect to battery packs. Lots of pockets. The only thing I wish it did have is a hoop or keychain connector on the outside so I can hook my glove clip and badge clip to. The colors are great, I got the gray and black to conceal any dirt or grease because I work in a factory. All around, this product is amazing so far and I would recommend.",
