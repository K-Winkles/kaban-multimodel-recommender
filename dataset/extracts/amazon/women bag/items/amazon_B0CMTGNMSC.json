I purchased the large bag, so it fit full size bottles upright. This thing held everything, and love the hanging feature. Seems durable, have taken on 4 trips, zippers and closures still intact. For the price (it was $15.99 when I purchased) it\u2019s a great deal, I saw bags for more money in stores with only half the space and not hangable. The large size is best suited for packing in luggage, but I did make it work in a large tote bag for 1 trip. Glad I purchased this because it holds all my personal things in one compact space, makes packing simple.",

In hindsight - I should have chosen a different color. The black fabric picks up quite a lot of lint, dust, etc. making the bag appear older, well used and dirty when in fact it's brand new and never used. Would purchase another - but again - a different color.",
