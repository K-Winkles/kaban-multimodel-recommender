It was wrapped up so well I needed scissors to open the packaging. Then the bag and all the straps and stuff are also protected.Moving on to the bag itself, I looked at sooo many \u201cbriefcases for women\u201d. I wanted it to be stylish yet functional and a good price. This one beat out the others mainly because it has a pocket on both sides. One for my phone bc no one wants to dig around inside a bag for their phone anymore. And the other side for my iPad has a magnetic closure. The inside has a spot for a travel coffee mug or water bottle, many do not have that option. Also plenty of space for books or files, my laptop, pens, the included wallet, a charging pack & all the other essentials a girl carries in her [mary poppins] bag.There are lots of these bags out there but this had everything on my checklist. Praying it holds up well!",

Most of the time my travel is by car, but occasionally by plane. This bag holds my computer, computer charging cable, two phones, and other word documents with plenty of space for my other purse items. I love that it zips on top as well so that the contents of my bag don't get dumped out when my bag is on its side. The bag looks professional (not cheap!) and has held up well so far to the travel I have done with it. I am very happy with it!",
