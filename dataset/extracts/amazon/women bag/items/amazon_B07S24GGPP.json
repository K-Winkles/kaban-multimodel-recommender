I carry this bag to work and like being able to separate my lunch in the waterproof slightly insulated side. I can put my heels and other things in the other pocket. Plenty big for a laptop as well. I don\u2019t carry a ton since I walk a lot and I don\u2019t want it to get too heavy, but I could definitely fit a lot in the bag if I needed to. I can see taking this on road trips too for the insulated side.",

Most other totes try to be your purse as well, but I love my purses and hated having to get everything out of my laptop bag to put in my purse when I don\u2019t want to take my laptop bag around on errands like grocery shopping or going for dinner.There\u2019s a separate zipper for each compartment (lunch and laptop). There\u2019s a small inside zippered pocket for the power cord. There\u2019s a small outside zippered pocket where I put earbuds and phone charger. Well priced.My only complaints are that it doesn\u2019t come in smaller sizes. Most laptops are 13\u201d nowadays. This one can fit a 17\u201d laptop. It could also be a little more stylish. Anyway, maybe it\u2019s meant more to be a giant beach bag, because that\u2019s what it looks like when I\u2019m carrying it to work. But it\u2019s not an eyesore.",
