                "reviewText": "The design is simple, minimalist and really unique!The gray color is beautiful, and the material and stitching feel good and sturdy.It\u2019s not a real leather so I hope it will last for few years.For this price - think it\u2019s the best choice!I used to have a larger backpack for work, taking everything I need with me for a long day outside.With this one, it\u2019s not that possible, so I have to give up on things, and take only the few most important things I need.The bag is relatively big, related to other fashion brands.It fits my MacBook 17\u201d with the additional sleeve, and I left with some spare room for notebook and small things like charger and mouse.There is no room for a water bottle on the bag sides, they are really tiny and tight so you have to use the front pocket.Also the back is soft, and the shoulder belts are slightly slippery, so I still try to get use to it.In general I really love it! But I have to get used to it because I prioritize comfort and functionality.I think it suits best for casual use and fashionable appearance.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The bag looks strong and aesthetically appealing. However the description says can hold up to a 16\" laptop but I don't see that. I have a 14 inch and the security strap to keep the laptop within the bag is NOT able to tack because it is too short. The space will not take the laptop in any other position but upright. Wrangler definitely should fix that",

It arrived within of a paperbag and another plastic bag, but the bag itself is lovely because I can put a laptop with a 14-inch screen in it. The USB thing on the side is annoying, but overall I like it.",

It's the perfect size; it is not so large that I am packing it with stuff that weighs down my ability to travel but is large enough to take exactly what I need. The fabric is soft but durable, and it looks great for client visits. I highly recommend this - it looks more expensive than it is.",
