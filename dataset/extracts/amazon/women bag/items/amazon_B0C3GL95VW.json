I have only used the smaller, plain bag that comes in the package once but I found it very convenient when traveling. The \"stuff\" bag is bigger and very cute. I love the colors and the size of the bag. I keep tons of smaller items in it and it fits everything I need it to. I am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend. It's well made, no problems with the zipper, or anything else. It's a great size and it works for me! My 8 year old daughter wants it too. I may buy her one for her bookbag!",
