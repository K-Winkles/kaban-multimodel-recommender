                "reviewText": "I recently acquired this lunch bag, and I couldn't be more delighted with my purchase.One standout feature is the thoughtfully designed interior that comfortably fits my bowls, preventing any awkward squeezing or compromising of the food containers. The two convenient side pockets are a game-changer, providing dedicated spaces for my water bottles, ensuring I stay hydrated throughout the day. Additionally, the front zipper pocket is a handy addition, perfect for stashing small items like my phone or condiments.What truly sets this lunch bag apart is its ability to keep food scents contained. I've had my fair share of lunch bags that couldn't contain the aroma within a few hours, but this bag is a breath of fresh air\u2014literally! Even after several hours, there's no lingering scent, preserving the freshness of both the bag's contents and my surroundings.The bag's construction is top-notch, with sturdy stitching and quality materials. It exudes durability and feels like it's built to last. The zipper is robust and functions smoothly, adding to the overall positive experience.",

                "reviewText": "I love this roomy lunch box. The front and rear pockets are terrific. I love that it has two mesh side pockets. I put my 16 oz steel thermos in them. Mine has a extendable carry strap that I find very convenient when I am bring multiple items into the office. This can be shorter to wear over one shoulder, or extended to wear cross-body style, which is my preference. The regular handles are great for quick carrying, they won't go up on my shoulder, but are fine for hand carrying. If you have a bit of a hike to the office like I do, you may want your hands free. The handles and straps seem sturdy enough. They are not duffle-bag robust, but I am not carrying 20 pounds of exercise equipment in it either.The stabilizing support bars that go around the top of the bag are a real help. I love that the bag/box is sized well enough and has those shape stabilizing bars so that I can pack/remove typical rectangular food containers easily and without spilling from having to tip them over. The support bars hold the top of the bag into the same rectangular dimension as the bottom, allowing easy packing/unpacking. It also makes clean up easy.The bag is roomy enough for several food containers and cold packs. I typically carry breakfast, lunch, and a snack along with a cold pack. Usually I pack one glass container about 4x6x2, a single serving of yogurt, fruit, and a bottle or thermos of water/tea, along with the cold pack. I could easily get more food in there. The contents are still cold 6 or 7 hours later.The bag looks great, neither feminine nor masculine, depending on your color selection. Mine is gray. The outside of the bag is easy to clean also. I have actually received several complements on the back. Two coworkers asked me to share a link to the item. I am very happy with my purchase and recommend it.",
