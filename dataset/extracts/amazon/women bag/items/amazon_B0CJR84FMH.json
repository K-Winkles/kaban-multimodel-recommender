                "reviewText": "This laptop bag is a stylish, lightweight, and versatile bag with seemingly durable handles. The entire bag looks to be well-made and includes three zipping compartments (one main zipper, one on the outside, and one on the inside). The outside area of the tote contains a medium zipper pocket for a charger, pens, or other small items. The zipper seems sturdy and zips/unzips with ease. Inside, the bag has an area designed for a laptop with a velcro flap to hold a laptop in place. There is another zipper pouch inside as well, but this zipper is smaller and doesn\u2019t seem to zip/unzip as easily. The first time that I zipped it, the zipper wanted to catch on the fabric. The main compartment of the bag also zips, something that some tote bags do not do. However, the material is very soft, so it may not be the best choice if your laptop does not have a protective case. Overall, this is a stylish laptop bag, but may not be the best choice for someone looking for more durability and protection.",

                "reviewText": "I've used this bag as both a briefcase and an overnight bag. It's just a great size for the office or a very short trip. The style is simple, neutral, and classic. I like the wide, sturdy shoulder strap and the variety of pockets. The exterior pocket is a good size for my phone, sunglasses, or keys. I like that my 15\" laptop fits snugly into its dedicated padded pocket and has a stretchy velcro retainment strap in addition to the top zipper for the whole bag.The two things I don't love are #1--the handle straps are a bit thin and floppy. They feel sturdy, but the PU leather seems like it will be the first thing to wear out. #2--the inside lining is fairly thin and is not tacked down or sewn into itself, so the dividers and one of the pockets sag out of place or just get in my way when rummaging for something.",

I love the material this bag is made out of and it would be very easy to clean by wiping down. The handles are sturdy too!",

After using it for just a few days, I am happy with the number of pockets and pouches (sometimes too many, and you lose things in pockets you forgot about) and you can fill it with a ton of stuff. The bag is well constructed and exactly as pictured, and the option of a cross-body strap is great since it's roomy enough that it could potentially get pretty heavy. The bag itself is super lightweight and looks great with any outfit!",
