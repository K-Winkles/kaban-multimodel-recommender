                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars It's More Than Meets the Eye",
                "reviewText": "I've been looking for a replacement for my canvas bag for years & found it in this bag with all the features ticked & more.- The bag is more vertical than horizontal. I want that coz I don't like a bag that juts out sideways & hits people accidentally when I carry it around. I'm small-built so I don't want my bag to be too big for me either.- The bag can fit both my 14\" laptop & A4 documents in it without squeezing them. I always keep my laptop in its own bag with all its accessories so a carrying bag that can fit my laptop in its cover & still has some allowances on top for proper zipping is a big plus.- The bag is made of good quality canvas. I'm happy that the canvas used in this bag is quite thick; its quality closely resembles my previous bag. Canvas is also kind of waterproof so I don't need to worry too much about it being rained on & being destroyed by it if I don't wipe it away quickly, unlike leather bags.- The bag has pockets that are actually useful. Some bags have more pockets for the sake of having more pockets without a thought for its usage & safety. This bag's design isn't like that. All exterior pockets have a zipper & all interior pockets are open. The interior of the middle exterior pocket shown in the pic with the cartoon tissue pack is unique to me; the depth of the pocket where the tissue pack & tube are placed is really shallow. This is where you can put your keys. However, if you don't like that, you can hook it up & have it hung out on a clasp attached, as shown in the last pic. The bigger pocket beside it is deep.- The side inner pockets are small yet stretchable. Where my mini umbrella sits, that's where the pocket is. There's another one on the other side The pocket is only stretchable enough to fit a slim water bottle; I don't mind this. I'm just glad my umbrella has a fixed area to sit so it doesn't fall & get lost at the bottom of the bag when I need it.- Both straps are also made of canvas. As a result, they don't look lame & cheap like an after-thought add-ons. They also stay put on your shoulder when you use them; the metal button on the shoulder strap ensures that both straps remain together instead of one constantly slipping down. The cross-body strap has thick cushion for the shoulder but the length the strap can be shortened to is limited by the metal clasp; I can slide it into the cushion but that's not advisable coz I can feel the metal in it when the cushion rests on my shoulder.- The middle exterior pocket can fit an iPad; not an 11\" model & above though. Mine is an 11\" model & it juts out slightly, so I can't zip up that pocket. However, if I want a quick slip-in & slip-out, the pocket serves that purpose.- The bag can stand on its own depending on its contents & doesn't bulge out noticeably when it's fully packed.- The brand is inconspicuous even though it's placed in an obvious place.In a nutshell, the bag has been thoughtfully designed in all aspects; it's small & compact yet big enough to automatically help you carry & organise your contents in it with its well-designed pockets. In my opinion, it can definitely last for quite a few years even with constant usage.Thank you, Etronik, for the well-designed bag!",

Has a zip section to the back if you need it. In the main compartment it has a separate area for your laptop with a strap over the top to secure it. Then it has more pockets and pen holders as well as two bottle holders on either side of the bag. What I love most is that it's built to carry the weight if you decide to fill up the whole bag it's not heavy on your shoulders. I've used it everyday since I bought it! The pouch is bigger than it appeared in the picture, it too has pockets inside. You could use it to store your cords & chargers but I use it for personal hygiene products as it's a quick grab & I already had a charger case. I so far haven't had to use the crossbody strap but it too is sturdy and comes with the shoulder padding.Not the greatest review video showing actual use but you get the point :)",

I purchased it for work since now I have to take my work from home laptop into work and this bag has so much space for not only the laptop but I carry my lunch in it as well. Has 2 ways to carry several pockets including 2 cup holders inside the big pocket and a leather type bottom which is great for me since I tend to have it on the floor alot and it prevents my bag from getting stained or wet.",
