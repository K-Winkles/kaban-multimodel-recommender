The material is a little weird and rough/crunchy, it unfortunately attracts every bit of fuzz around me. I wish the material was slightly different but I do love the puffer look. I also like the small change purse included, I use it for cough drops and hand sanitizer but it\u2019s easily large enough for credit cards and a little cash.Purse has two magnetic straps on the flap corners to hold it closed. Lining those magnets up while on the move is a little challenging, but they do stay closed nicely once secured.",

                "reviewText": "This super cute purse is extra billowy and chic. I am able to find everything with minimal effort because it is one large section instead of multi-partitioned sections with extra places for things to hide. But it is on the shorter side, so that makes it puff out width-wise. My RFID wallet is on the larger size. Add to that an inhaler case, an OTC migraine bottle, and my phone - and it gets pretty complicated trying to not look like I can't downsize a purse to the essentials (which is the only thing in there). I'm not a fan of short-and-fat, so it's not my ideal daily purse.It comes with an alternate strap, but when I put it on it just looked weird and like it didn't go. The alternate strap is beige and white, so it matches, but it is like an Aztec-style-pattern that looks like you lost the strap that actually goes to the purse and went with whatever you could find that matches. I didn't like it. The strap that matches has an adjustable length with a large silver buckle for adjusting. That got tricky for me, though because the purse is short and stout and my body-type is pear (36-36-46 | 5'4 | 145lbs). So, if I lengthen the strap, it hits my hips and makes them appear wider. As a result, I needed to keep the strap short enough to have the purse sit at the small of my waist. But that caused a persistent fight between the strap and my coat lapel, which kept pushing it out.Extra adjustments aside, it's a really nice purse. It is thick and feels like it would be insulated enough to use during Winter months without worrying that your goodies are going to freeze inside if you are outside too long. And it goes with the majority of casual and business-casual outfits. So, I recommend it, albeit with all the caveats stated above. LOL",
