Thee organization of the card slots and cash areas are inconvenient. The card slots are smaller than a credit card so it takes some wiggling to get them in, then it\u2019s heck to get them out! You could put your cards in the zippered part but then it feels insecure. The part for the phone is protected and secured with the flap. The whole thing feels unbalanced and uneven. I\u2019m keeping it because I\u2019ve used it but just be aware.",

                "reviewText": "At first I thought it was a great purse, until I put it into use. Small items fell out of the side zipper pocket because of the zipper design going around to the side. I decided it was unsafe to place cash in. Credit card slots slightly too narrow for easy horizontal placement and too wide for vertical placement (the slipped). I was able to carry my phone with me safely. It mostly served its purpose on my vacation but I do not plan to use it again.",

I needed something small and this was within the size stated on the stadium\u2019s website. I haven\u2019t used it yet, but it seems to be made well. The fact that it was a cross body bag was another reason I purchased it.Update: This bag may not be approved at all stadiums. I was allowed into the Minnesota Twins game with this bag, but not at the Minnesota Vikings Stadium with it. Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t go back to our car to bring it back so I had to throw it in the trash at the entrance or not be allowed into the game. Don\u2019t expect this bag to be allowed at all stadiums.",
