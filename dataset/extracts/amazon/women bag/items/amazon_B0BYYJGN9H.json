I put my lunch bag, wristlet, 40oz water jug, 16oz coffee cup, among other things (small notebook, kindle, small lotion bottle, pens, etc). There are three pockets inside, two drink pockets (one on either end) and two others, one front (zippered) and one back. There\u2019s so much room for everything. This bag could be used for school, the gym/athletics, or even as a diaper bag. Awesome product and great price. Quality seems to be good so far, as well.",
