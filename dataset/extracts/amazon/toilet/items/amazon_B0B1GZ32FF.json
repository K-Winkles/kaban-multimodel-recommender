                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Product to install and use; will wait for longevity",
                "reviewText": "I discovered easy-to-install add-on bidets about twelve years ago in a hotel in Melaka, Malaysia. Since then, I've owned five: (1) an American version of the (Japanese) Toto Eco-Washer that I saw in that hotel; (2) several Blue Bidet BB-1000's; (3) a dual nozzle Bio Bidet Slim Edge; and now (4) this one to replace (3), which broke down after three years.This product seems the best thought-out and designed of all\u2014with by far the best instructions, in fluent native-level English\u2014and by far the easiest to install. The instructions even explained several variations of US \"standard\" plumbing that should accommodate nearlyany standard toilet.The operating design is by bar the best for cleaning the mechanism and keeping it clean. A small, white plate protects the nozzle when retracted, and I think that's all you need clean regularly. Just a swipe or two of the old toilet brush should do it. But you can also extend the nozzle to clean it, too. (I haven't yet tried this.)In addition, there's a separate dial for the cleaning mode, which waters the nozzle (and the plate?) for cleaning. You can use this even while sitting on the toilet. Best of all, the whole apparatus bends back on hinges to allow you to clean the toilet under-edge behind the bidet. (This part of our toilet had accumulated some really disgusting black sludge, which may have been hose detritus or even black mold. Now I think it will never darken our bowl again!).Installation was also well thought out. I brought out a bunch of tools from my toolkit and only needed one\u2014a long handled screwdriver to tighten my pre-existing toilet-seat bolts after installation. The product itself contained all the wrenches you need to install the device, include a special thumb wrench permanently mounted on the bidet hose, which you can use to tighten each end by hand.The nice little secret of this device (and most modern plumbing) is that you don't need any big heavy wrenches. All the plumbing fixtures included, as well (probably) as the nut on your existing toilet tank supply, work just like garden hoses. Each has an interior rubber washer that seals against the interior metal without your straining to tighten anything.You only need to watch out for two things. First, make sure the washer for each joint hasn't somehow slipped out before joining the parts. Second, be careful to align the two threaded parts to be joined gently, and not to cross the threads. If the threads are aligned right, you will never have to exert more than easy finger pressure to wind the nut on, until it gets close to tightening. In fact, I never used a wrench at all, other than the finger one supplied on the input hose. I hand-tightened everything, and there were no leaks. (If you're obsessive-compulsive like me, you can put a paper towel down after installation and see whether any drops show up in the next day. If so, just tighten a bit more.)Total installation time took 32 minutes, with less than an hour including the first test and clean-up. You needn't fear installing this yourself if you have any mechanical skill at all.On my previous dual-nozzle Bio-Bidet Slim Edge (before it broke down) the stream for pooping was so strong it hurt my anus, so I had to shift forward and use the dual (supposedly female) nozzle. In contrast, this bidet had tolerable stream pressure up to the end of its range.I noticed only two minor things that might be improved. First, the stream seemed a little spray-ey, but I'm sure we can get used to that. Second, the little supplied thumb wrench on the stainless supply hose was put in backwards, but it could still be used on both ends.The only thing we might worry about with this product is longevity, and for that we'll just have to wait and see. At the moment, just after installation and first test, it seems the clearly best of the breed, and at a good price.",

                "reviewText": "It baffles me why the US is so far behind when it comes to having bidets in the bathroom. I do construction and am seeing more homes put them in, but it\u2019s crazy how people don\u2019t get the importance of having clean hygiene after doing your business. Here is a little anal-ogy: Say you were picking after your dog and got some poop on your hand. You wouldn\u2019t take a piece of toilet paper or paper towel and wipe it off and call it a day, would you? No, you\u2019re gonna wash it off with soap and water. It\u2019s the same concept as that, do what you normally do and then wash off with the Luxe Neo 120 Plus. You can use soap and water or just plain water. But after using this a few times you will never want to use a bathroom without a bidet again. It\u2019s that good! I just bought 3 more to give to family members on Christmas for a stocking stuffer from Santa.Before buying mine I read in the comments that some people bought the extra bumpers/spacers and others didn\u2019t. I decided to purchase them because I wanted the toilet seat to be a little raised up more than the bidet itself. The bumpers on my seat are not high at all and didn\u2019t want all the weight going on the bidet and possibly cracking it. As it is made of plastic. Just get a tube of 100% silicone, it can be clear or white it doesn\u2019t matter. Get the location where you want to set the bumpers and put a nice size gob on them and then close the seat and lid and put like a 10lb weight on it for a few hours. Then I put some more silicone around the whole edge of the bumper where it meets the seat and use your finger or caulking tool to smooth it out. Silicone is very strong and you can also remove them with a putty knife without damaging the seat or bumpers if you need to take them off in the future. Other than that, installation was a breeze. It took maybe 10 minutes at most to install everything. You\u2019ll only need 2 tools, a slotted screwdriver and an adjustable v-jaw pliers or crescent wrench. Everything else is provided in the box besides the extra bumpers and silicone. I am thoroughly happy with the Luxe brand bidets and its performance so far. I highly recommend that brand if you are thinking about getting one. Just do it!!! It\u2019s 100% worth the money to invest in one. Besides your hygiene you\u2019ll be saving money on not having to buy toilet paper and wipes so often. It really is a game changer, it\u2019ll leave you clean as a whistle.",

                "reviewText": "I just visited Japan last month and for the first time I used a bidet. Long story short: the Japanese-style bidet should be the standard in the entire world. Toilet paper DO NOT CLEAN YOU ENTIRELY! If you wipe your rear only with toilet paper please keep this is mind: you have feces in your rear no matter how clean you think you are. When I was back home I was convinced I needed a Japanese-style bidet so I saw some high end options, around $350 but before buying one of those I decided to try this one because it is only $40. First thing is that I was able to install it in 5 minutes without any tools, super easy. How does it work? Absolutely fantastic! it shoots water so strong to the area that needs to be cleaned and believe me: it cleans you! I use toilet paper just to literally make sure my rear is clean, and it always is. Just in toilet paper savings this product pays for itself in a couple of months! It doesn't have features that high end bidets have like warm water, drying, warm seat, lights, sounds, or female washing (sorry ladies) but to clean your hole, this bidet is absolutely perfect! Absolutely every home in the Western countries should have a bidet, this is the best way to have your rear really clean. Try to clean a plate of Nutella mixed with grease only with toilet paper, it'll always be sticky and smell like Nutella, you need water to really wash it, same thing with your back door. Buy a bidet you need it either you admit it or not!",

This is one constant in my life that hasn't changed in quality and I'm glad the new plus model is an improvement over the still good old model.I really like the new slide-in mechanism. Made installation so much easier and faster. It took me 15 minutes to install. The new model looks posh and clean. Wish they were a little cheaper in Canada though.",

You won't be able to find what you need at bunnings or plumbing shop btw as the fitting that connects the hose to the actual bidet is a different size again and completely non standard.Luxe do not have an exact 1/2 inch t adapter replacement part for this model...The work around provided by luxe (free of charge though you pay postage) is the hot water t adapter (you can use it with cold) with a plasticky hose. (Parts can be found on luxe website).Everything is now working. But I had to waste a lot of time finding the solution! Not to mention waiting a long time for second package to arrive. If you're outside of US be aware of differences in plumbing sizes. AliExpress products appear cheaper and with correct fittings provided for different countries. Personally go there next time...Update: little plastic hose popped off fottong and nearly flooded bathroom. Not suitable for Au, returned",
