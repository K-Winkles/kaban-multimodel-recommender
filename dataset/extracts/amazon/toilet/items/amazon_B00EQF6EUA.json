                "reviewText": "The base and the cover are not compatible. The cover provided does not fit onto the tank of the base. Amazon has been working past month to correct problem. Had to send pictures to Kohler as they did not believe when detail part numbers were sent for each component. Having to be patient. Do hope and expect Amazon to take both components back at no cost if Kohler cannot provide a cover that fits. Person of Amazon handling matter has been gracious and thoughtful.",
