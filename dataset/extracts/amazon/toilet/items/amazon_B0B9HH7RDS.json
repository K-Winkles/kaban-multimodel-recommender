It's easy to install on a standard toilet, and it's easier to use than I expected. Speaking of use, I bought it for three reasons: 1) personal hygiene; 2) saving resources; and 3) means of cleaning toilet without chemicals. This sprayer excels in all. I use very little toilet paper and seldom have to clean the toilet with chemicals now. If you live in a rural area with septic or cesspool, the latter two are as important as the first item.",
