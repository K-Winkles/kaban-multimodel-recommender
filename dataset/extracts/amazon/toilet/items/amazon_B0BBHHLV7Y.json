Nothing gross to touch and absolutely NO splashing with having to clean anything! You don't even need gloves to empty! Absolutely ZERO mess! Pull the bag, tie it up and put it in the garbage! No different than a baby's diaper. I will never do a black tank!And the battery lasts forever! We camp at least 3 weekends a month and I only charge the battery once in the Spring and once in the late fall. In regards to the level of service, it is a family-style atmosphere and they are TOP NOTCH! I waited too long to order for a trip, I totally dropped the ball. I went out on a limb and emailed them in hopes there was something they could do. The President of the company responded right away and ensured my order went out the same day!! The absolute best service and support!",

                "reviewText": "Update: I got it to work without having to manually rotate the bag! Using this involved a small learning curve, though. At first I used it every time I needed to go, but I soon realized that I'd run out of space long before the bag ran out of flushes. The best way to use this, for me, is as a night toilet so I don't have to go outside in the dark. Otherwise, I go in nature or use restrooms when I'm in town. That ensures that the bag doesn't need to be replaced before it's done, which is important because where this company actually makes its money is those $*&%ing refills. I imagine they're patented, so there won't be off-brand versions at a reasonable price for many years. I'm going to work on a DIY version so it doesn't cost me nearly $2 every time I flush because that's absolutely ridiculous. Once I figure that out, this toilet will be perfect!Original: I have to manually rotate the bag insert to twist it, otherwise the bag puffs up and then just goes back down without covering anything. As long as I twist the liner a full 360\u00b0, the waste gets covered properly and no smell. Some folks complain that the flush button is too sensitive, and it is very sensitive, so maybe the fact that I have to manually rotate the bag will save me some accidental flushes? I'm okay with having to move it around by hand - it's still better than a stinky chemical toilet!",

I am a really hard sell on ANYTHING that I do not believe in and clearly this is my opinion but, the Laveo Dry-Flush is an amazing product that not only provides use for me now but in the future.I purchased my new home and as we all know, if you are not buying new construction, you are most likely going to have some renovations. Well, I bought a beautifully sound home but with ancient bathrooms, yes both bathrooms. I needed for obvious reasons a toilet for workers as well as myself and that\u2019s where the Laveo Dry Flush came into play. It is wonderful! I simply took it out of the box, watched a variety of tutorials on their website and it was done. I am a single woman so I did not want an item that required a lot of lifting or hassle. This item is so convenient and remember as I said above, I always buy (or try to) an item that has other uses? Well, after the construction is complete, this same toilet will remain in my family for use if my elderly parents need it in their bedroom, for future camping trips with my great-niece and nephew and if the future holds a boat for me, whoa, it would be amazing on it!A true quality made product that has many uses \u2013 a win-win if you ask me!",

                "reviewText": "I recently bought various products to turn my van into a \u201cpoor man\u2019s RV \u201c and avoid the huge up front costs of buying a manufactured and outfitted van. Regardless, I shelled out some bucks. The best value for the dollar and most appreciated was this Laveo toilet. No water, no smell, no holes to make in your van, no electrical hook up and extremely well made. Bravo! Shipping was fast and shipping box was heavy duty. Owner even sent a signed thank you note with his private phone number. I called him on Easter Sunday and wanted to tell him via voicemail about how good his product is. I was floored that he answered the phone and was beyond friendly and appreciative.",

I hate it when something brushes up against button and flushes when not needed. Each flush is $2, thus inadvertently flushing can get expensive. I know other people that have this toilet and say the same thing about flush button.I do love it. No smell and easier to deal with garbage.",
