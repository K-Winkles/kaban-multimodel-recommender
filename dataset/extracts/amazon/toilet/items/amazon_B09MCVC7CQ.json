                "reviewText": "The downside: Usually with a bidet you connect the cold water to the water supply/pipe for the toilet. But if you want hot water you have to get it from somewhere to hook it up to the bidet. Frequently (and with this product) that requires hooking it up to your sinks hot water. Easy enough? However, as an American our bathrooms can be set up differently where your sink is opposite your toilet. This complicates things bc now you need to run the piping across the middle of the floor to connect. If you want to track the tubing around the perimeter of the bathroom you need to get a longer connector bc the one that comes with this is too short. All things to think about especially if you are a beginner. I bought this and I don\u2019t even use the temperature function. Kind of a waste but I did not return it bc of the below reasons:Regardless this was so easy to install and for the price- it was exactly what I was looking for. It\u2019s super easy to clean and is simple to navigate and use. It\u2019s a good bidet for starters and long time users alike- installed for my mother who has trouble moving around easily. It kept her independent and was easy to learn and get used to.Pro:- good price- easy to install- easy to cleanCon:- unless your sink and toilet are right next to eachother it won\u2019t work- I only am able to use cold water- awkward fit",

                "reviewText": "I had ordered a different bidet originally, but it would not fit my toilet correctly. The nozzle protruded an inch and a half into the inside of the toilet seat. I scanned around Amazon and came across this one with excellent reviews. I placed the order and the bidet was at my work location in two days. As I\u2019m installing the bidet I found out that the cold water hose is meant for a standard toilet. Not a toilet on a ship. The hot water hose ran perfectly to my sink, so I emailed customer service. After I explained my situation they immediately and without request, sent the parts I needed to run the cold water hose from the sink as well. They had to ship it to my home, which is fine, I\u2019m heading home this week anyway and can bring the parts back next hitch. I was able to put together a makeshift hose in the mean time just to test the bidet out. And it\u2019s fabulous. Water temp mixture was perfect, spray pressure was easily adjustable and I really like the fact that you can manually aim the nozzle with a toggle type switch. My wife hates the other bidet I have at home because it has an arm that unintentionally actuates the bidet in the middle of the night when she goes to the restroom\u2026.. Which can be very intrusive if you don\u2019t know it\u2019s coming. I told her about this one and she insists I get another to replace the bidet at home. Another awesome selling point is that you do not need the big seat risers for this unit. It\u2019s body is slim enough to fit between the seat and the toilet without the need for the risers.This bidet is priced right, works well, fits correctly and has the sellers backing 100% I am extremely happy with the purchase and with the customer service experience.",

I don't have issues getting burned by the hot water as I read in some reviews, I really have no complaints at all. The video is of the cleaning feature.
