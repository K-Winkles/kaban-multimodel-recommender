It's a No from me. I can't recommend. Toilets are supposed to be comfortable ! I will look for a softer seat for it maybe that will do the trick. I will update if it helps.",

Toilets purchased at Home Deport for much less would last much longer than these!Design: The water level in the bowl is too low causing feces to be stuck to the surface above the water.

                "reviewText": "The toilet is not bad but the seat is an absolute piece of garbage! In addition, the covers for the holes on the back sides of the bowl are missing. When you buy a new toilet for over $300 it should have all the parts and a REAL toilet seat that actually sits straight and covers the rim of the bowl!! Unacceptable and not worth the price. Buy a different brand. UPDATE: if you like using a plunger ALL THE TIME, this is the toilet for you! However, I like a toilet that actually works when you flush and doesn't require plunging! DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND!!!!",
