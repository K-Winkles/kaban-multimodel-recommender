                "reviewText": "I was under the impression that this was a regular sized toilet.When I opened it I was disappointed since it looked more like a kid's toilet.I sat on it and it was lower than regular, and It was not wide or long enough to cover everything that needed to be covered.So I returned it right away.The quality of the toilet was as expected for the price, it just looks more like a kids toilet than an adult toilet.CHECK THE DIMENSIONS FIRST BEFORE ORDERING THIS TOILET, to make sure that this small size toilet is what you need.",

Everything you need is in the packaging (just get the hook up for the water supply). Works great, the one button push to remove the lid is a plus for cleaning",

                "reviewText": "It's been 6 months since we replaced our beloved but old standard onepiece with this toilet. Our quarter bath added in the 1940s is not up to code for today's standard so we needed something super compact to fit the space. It uses far less water and has a much more effective flush. I love it. The only things that could be improved are the top buttons are a little rough on the edges and the toilet seat is so oddly shaped, I'm not sure if we could find a replacement if something happened to it. Love the soft lose seat. With 2 toddlers, this main floor toilet gets used often, and is a great upgrade. The seat is slightly higher than our old toilet which is nice for the adults.",

I am dismayed at the size and the cost. It was double the price I paid for another toilet but the trap was 12 inches and I needed a 10 inch one. I purchased this particular toilet based on the recommendation of the contractor. I gave it two stars because I'm disappointed in the look. It looks like a toilet that should be used in a kiddie daycare center. I really wish I could send it back. If you are larger than a child then I DO NOT recommend that you purchase this toilet. It is not a standard size toilet!",
