That is because the spray that comes out of this thing is like a firehose. Holy cow! I would not use this anywhere near your nether regions or it might blow your booty hole off. This was super easy to install - you simply unscrew one hose, attach the 3 way valve, and attach the hoses. It also looks great. I highly recommend this for anyone using it to clean (shoes, cloth diapers, mop buckets), but NOT for a bidet.",

                "reviewText": "Had it for about a year with very light use. Today the hose exploded off of the handle and was gushing water around our bathroom! Praise God my wife found it and pointed the hose of water into the tub, and I was also home to the water supply off for her. That was a $$,$$$ mess in the making.Read the one-star reviews. More than a dozen other people have had similar situations. Seriously, if you buy this and it happens to you while you're out to dinner (or worse, on vacation), you could have wrecked flooring, trim, framing, drywall, and furniture in multiple rooms and mold remediation bills that cost a fortune. We had two whole rooms flooded after less than two minutes of water running, and we were home and ready! I am super disappointed with this product, and there is no way I'd ever buy one of these again.Installation was simple (there are a number of bidets like this one, and they mostly all install the same way). Turns out the build quality was terrible. The \"metal\" feeling hose has a simple rubber one inside. The rubber one is the only one anchored in the handle. The metal hose is just a sleeve. My guess is that the cut-off end of the metal sleeve must have nicked the rubber hose inside, and then the pressure finished the job. We had not used the bidet in several weeks when it ruptured today--the failure had nothing to do with our use.The manufacturer needs to redesign the hose connections. From other reviews, it also seems like the valves are so-so and often leak (thankfully we didn't have that issue). This product failure was unacceptable.",
