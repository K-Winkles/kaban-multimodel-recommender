This toilet is sturdy and water efficient. Looks great and fit my space perfectly. I had an old and very low-sitting toilet before (which as a female I didn't mind the height). This has been a great transition and is the right compromise height for male and female squatters ;).I did price comparing with other sites and home stores - this was the best price.No issues with shipping. It was well packed!Installation was a breeze once we had the right bolts. I shouldn't have ordered the recommended one for those - just get them from the hardware store upon toilet arrival.My water bill is finally consistently lower!",

Manual says that it is included. I went ahead and purchased the items that were missing. Cost about $14. I asked the seller if they would refund $10. It took them about a week to contact me. They said they would send me the hardware if I sent them a copy of the order. I had already done that in my first email. Two weeks later and I have never heard back from them. Eaven the TOTO name on the bowl was not straight. Cocked to one side. Other wise it is a good product. Just hope that you don't have a problem. Home centers sell the same item and will stand behind the sell.",

                "reviewText": "We installed one of these in our powder room six years ago, so when it was time to replace the 25 year old toilet that the builder installed in hour kids bath, I was very confident that we would be happy with this Toto toilet. They are made very well, and engineered to do a great job. The older toilet used more water, and clogged often, but this works well for the kids who don't always forget to hold the handle down for solids. These toilets have a partial flush, by quickly pressing the lever, or a full tank flush by holding the lever down until the tank is empty. I highly recommend this toilet.",

                "reviewText": "I replaced a 20 year old toilet that used gallons of water per flush and had to be flushed twice to remove a \"load\".I was skeptical that a small amount of water could flush a toilet, but then as I mentioned I have not had a modern toilet until now. I was also concerned about having such a product delivered by UPS as I have had other lesser sized items damaged in transit. However, this was the most securely packaged product I have ever seen: foam around all sides and well designed packaging. The directions are clear for those who have never installed a toilet before, and did I mention that it flushes like a tidal wave.",
