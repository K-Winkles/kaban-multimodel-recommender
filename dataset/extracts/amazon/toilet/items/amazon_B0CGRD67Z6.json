I live in a house that was built about a hundred years ago so that probably has something to do with it. The image in the listing DOES say to check the size first, so I'm gonna double down on that recommendation lol.I will say, though, I was kind of surprised that the handle is plastic; feels pretty cheap. The valves, however, are metal. The lever that turns the water on doesn't have any sort of spring action to it, which I kind of expected it to have. It also doesn't have any clear clicking or indication between low pressure and high pressure, it seems to just smoothly open up further as you push the lever up. There are no instructions included so if you don't automatically intuit the best way to install it, you'll get to come back to the listing and listen to Vanessa Carlton play you through the steps in the video lol.",

The video in the product details made it seem simple but I haven't figured out how to get it in... I hate that I'll have to pay someone to do it now.
