                "reviewText": "As usual for so many products made in China ans use double stick tape, the tape in this product is a lot worse than useless. The glue seems to be very sticky. Ithink it has great affinity to human fingers.When used to attach two items made of plastic, the glue will slowly detach itself. It will still feel dticky to our fingers but to the target it will not adhere.There is an additional problem; this particular product is a bumper, spacer, or 'foot' attached to a toilet seat.Without getting into excessively great details, the broduct experiences the weight of an adult American person, who also tends to move a little while on the seat. This means tha there is a terrific pressure on the bumper, and it suffers sheer loads as well. These conditions literally peel the bumper, or twist it apart.I would recommend at least two small screws to be added.",

                "reviewText": "About a year ago I installed an inexpensive bidet attachment to our old toilet. Like many similar units, these install below the existing toilet set using the same bolts. While it works well, it has the side effect of lifting the back of the toilet seat about 3/8\", so that the seat no longer sits on any of its existing bumpers, but tilts forward to rest on the front of the toilet itself. The result is an unstable seat.These bumpers are what is needed, and should have been included with bidet attachment itself. As you can see from the photos, they lift the seat into a level position and restore it to the stability it had before. I was concerned that they would not stick to this old wooden toilet seat. But I carefully cleaned the attachment points with alcohol and held each bumper tightly for 30 seconds after applying it. So far so good.",

I agree that it's not the best, but it's not that bad. I just didn't trust \"hold it for 30 seconds\". I applied the bumper, and used the toilet for 15min or so. My body weight and longer pressure application did the magic trick, and they seem to be doing fine.",
