The one piece tank and makes it easier to clean. The flush is incredibly powerful. Fills up three times as fast as old one, and only use 1.6 gallons of water, my old one was over 5 gallons.

                "reviewText": "Before I got this, our toilet (a decent one, not a cheapo) would clog three to four times a month. Since I got this a few months ago, not one clog. There were a couple times when I thought it would clog, but I just needed to flush twice and it cleared. The seat is very flat which makes it comfortable, more so than those seats that are tapered in toward the bowl. I'm not sure if the one-piece design is worth the extra cost, but it does make it a little easier to clean. Note: Inspect it carefully because our tank lid is warped. I expect they'll replace it when I get around to letting them know, it's not that big a deal to us but it probably would be to most as it's somewhat noticeable. Our lid has to sit crooked anyway because of an attachment (bidet sprayer holder), so it doesn't make much difference to us. I do have a similar model I got for the downstairs in 2014. It has the same clog resistance and is almost the same model but it's the two-piece version. I had to call them about a problem once and their support was extremely responsive and helpful.",

Once our plumber installed it, the toilet's comfort and excellent flushing was so good, we ordered a second American Standard Champion 4 toilet on July 11, 2023, for our other bathroom. WOW -- it's the end of November 2023, and there hasn't been even a hint of a clog from either toilet.Hats off to Amazon for their well-cushioned outer carton, which ensured the toilet would arrive undamaged.",

I would have given it 5 stars, but the seat broke after only 4 months. I didn\u2019t get the extended warranty, so we have to pay for a new replacement seat. I really think the seat should last longer than that.",

                "reviewText": "The box from American Standard was inside a larger box that added a few inches all around with lots of padding so it arrived safely. Amazon delivered inside my door as advertised with great care. Delivery couldn't have gone better.Toilet came with a quick to remove seat. If my son moves on it, any sideways pressure the latch opens and releases the seat. The latch needs improvement.The toilet does not come with a wax/silicone ring or hold down bolts, you will need to buy whichever your preference is.The fill valve was a bit loose and leaked. It just needed the nut to be tightened a bit. Be sure the check it.The toilet is has a strong sudden flush. It would take allot to clog it. There is not much water running down from the rim to clean the bowl, but it's usually enough. The flush water enters at the bottom in a big rush to push the sides through.Look and finish are good. This is the second of these I bought, so yes I would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "First thing I noticed was how heavy it was. I had to get help to get it out of box and eventually into place in bathroom, unlike the Toto ones in the other two bathrooms. The discharge hole in bottom was a suprise as it is only 2.5\", smaller than the ones on the Toto. Suprise also that there was no wax ring, which this toilet, if you look at the instructions on how to put it on, takes a special size. Called American Standard who had to mail me the right one. (Turns out the picture on instructions was wrong). Fushing was good first couple of days but tank is a long wait to fill back up. Three days into the use it started to not flush. No matter how you tried to manipulate the flush using the handle it would not finish the flush. Finally it worked; once. Now it is stubborn, only finishing a flush everyother time. Returning it? Forget about it. Getting it out of box destroyed box. Trying to repackage it a real hassel. Then you have to have a trucking company ship it for you. This is after you go through all the work of taking it out of bathroom. Save your time and money and buy a Toto Drake. I should have stayed with that brand. (Toilet we were replacing was a cheap one that came with house which finally failed)",

Delivery was exactly as promised. It\u2019s a bit heavy but installation went smoothly. Instructions are clear and all parts are supplied (except the wax ring & water supply). Beware of the water connection: it\u2019s easy to loosen and turn the tank valve (verify). Caulking around the base is recommended to further stabilize the unit.Companion NEXT BY DANCO All-in-One Toilet Installation Kit can be ordered separately and works well.",
