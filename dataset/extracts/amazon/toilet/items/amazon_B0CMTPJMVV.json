                "reviewText": "Sure, we checked out the more expensive sets, and a friend has a Brondell with heated seat, heated water, and a remote. And those features ARE nice, but not needed, and you'll pay $300+ for that one seat.Meanwhile- two for ~ $40 US?It's a DEAL!This one hooks up to the incoming water supply- with all the hardware included.The T junction splits the water before the feed to the tank, so it's clean, pure water coming in straight from the water supply.It mounted quite nicely on our toilet, and everything connected easily.Be sure that you're sitting on the toilet before you try the knobs to adjust water flow, in 'ready to go mode'.If not, you will shoot streams of water across the room (depending on the water pressure of your system).While putting down the lid to do a test seems like a strategy, 1) you won't be able to observe the flow unless you have a clear toilet lid, & 2) it will likely leak out in front of the toilet anyway.(True, you won't observe the flow when you're sitting on the toilet, but no matter.You'll still KNOW if it's working or not- promise.)Use a gentle safecracker's touch when learning your system, else you may be enthusiastically surprised by the baptism of your nether regions.Anyway- you'll learn the fore and aft of it pretty quickly, and will learn how to attenuate the flow.You'll not have to worry about 'befouling' the nozzles, because they are behind a protective shield that retracts upon adjustment of the water pressure. Wipe the outside of the shield with a water dampened piece of toilet paper if any cleaning is ever needed, then flush the toilet paper .Do your business, give yourself a spritz as needed, and use enough toilet paper to dry yourself off, and you are done!(In other cultures, each person has their own drying towel for their use only, hung near the toilet. If you can make that system work for your household, great- but do hide the towels before guests arrive, for they may use them as a handtowel after washing their hands if they don't want to use the 'nice' towel that you may have set out for guests (and yeah, we don't want that to happen))All in all- an amazingly useful purchase!HOW I WISH that we had had this in place when my elderly parent lived with us, and we had some 'major cleanups'!I cannot overemphasize how helpful this would have been - it would have been easier, more hygienic, more dignified for all, to be able to do 'gross cleanup' with this item.Seriously- if you have an elderly parent, or even a youngster with challenged toilet habits in your household- this is A MUST HAVE. .",

I don't like how the holes fit onto the toilet itself because there is a seam that lines up in front of the screw holes (with little boys that have a hard time with their aim, I feel like we're going to end up with some dripping into the seam and have a smelly bathroom.) I also don't like that the words that are printed on the knob go in a circle...kind of hard to read when you're sitting down doing your business and have to read some of the wording upside down, I think it would have been better to just have pictures like other bidet attachment models. All in all though the thing works and it was cheap.",

                "reviewText": "This was probably the easiest thing I've ever installed, but I was disappointed because I was only getting a trickle instead of a spray. I pulled down the jets as instructed, but still nothing. I decided to examine the second unit in the box to identify if the one I installed was damaged. That's when I realised that the jets in the installed one were not coming all the way down. A closer inspection showed that the spray outlet was jammed up too close to the back of the bowl and that prevented the jets from fully extending. So a little manipulation of the alignment, by moving the unit forward a little bit, solved the problem. Lovely powerful spray that goes where it's needed.Day after installation, I noticed some leaks, which were solved by using some more teflon tape. So have your teflon tape ready before you start installation.",

                "reviewText": "Was a little skeptical at first but install was super easy and product not bulky on toilet. We can close our lid with no issue.The first time you try it, you will shoot off the toilet faster than a speeding bullet and may have to repaint the wall in front of toilet due to the extreme and precise stream of water. Also, be warned, the water is COLD! This intense stream, however is a good thing. Once you get settled back in, aka it takes some getting used to, but once you are experienced and are prepared for the cold stream, the toilet paper crisis will never be an issue for you again. We have 5 toilets in our house and I will only use one with a bidet from now on.This particular bidet has a nozzle for spraying the women\u2019s area, sorry can\u2019t help with review on that one, and for backside cleaning. Also women have opportunity for full blast of both nozzle at once if they\u2019re feeling adventurous.This is super easy to use with only one knob. I highly recommend testing by spraying a big bowl or something that will deflect water back in to the toilet to understand the intense stream before trying it first unaware. I speak from experience, trust me on this one. This bidet is cheap enough to try and see if you like it. Just remember the love of a bidet WILL NOT come on the first time you try it and maybe not for a few times, but when it does you will get off the toilet so fresh and so clean.This is worth giving it a shot for sure. The part that connects to the wall is metal and it comes with all parts needed to make it work.",

                "reviewText": "I installed this bidet attachment about 3 weeks ago and I must say it\u2019s wonderful. I really miss it when I\u2019m away from home. It was really easy to install and it comes with a metal and plastic T adapter. I used the metal one and haven\u2019t had any leaks. We have very hard water here, so I\u2019m not sure how the bidet will last, but so far it\u2019s been perfect. There\u2019s no temperature control but I haven\u2019t really minded the cold water. Only when I use it for over a minute does my butt feel like it\u2019s too cold - but that isn\u2019t very often. When you turn the control slightly to the left or right it self cleans the nozzles. I recommend getting toilet seat bumpers as mine could probably use them, but I\u2019ve been able to go without so far. Some other bidet attachments sit too close to the seat, but this one sticks out far enough that I\u2019m not touching it when sitting, even with my wide hips. The only thing I don\u2019t like about it is that when using the female spray it tends to spray a bit under the seat, but that\u2019s easy enough to quickly wipe up with toilet paper. I\u2019ve used waaaay less toilet paper since I got this - I\u2019m still on the same roll I started 3 weeks ago! My butt feels way cleaner and I absolutely love using it when I have my period. Keeps everything clean down there and uses way less water than using toilet paper alone. Highly recommended!",
