The delivery driver actually THREW it off his truck to the ground, and to my surprise there was NO DAMAGE \ud83d\ude03 to the toilet. It flushes very quietly, yet has no issue with \u201cgetting everything\u201d the first time. At this price point, please don\u2019t expect a high end lid for the seat. The slow close function works beautifully, but I\u2019ll upgrade later from the lightweight plastic one provided.Oh, customer service was great too! Helped quickly with a little issue that was actually my handyman\u2019s fault \ud83d\udc4d. He somehow got debris in the supply line.",
