Removed the toilet seat and installed the seat which comes with bidet. But make sure both model's measurements are compatible. I am a little worried about the position of the shut off valve, will it affect the installation? There is a picture in the link of the shut off valve position provided by horow. You can measure it according to the size. If the angle valve is on the ground, it may not be suitable. Could this work on 11\u2019 rough in? The 12\" toilet can't be installed on the 11\u2019 roughin, our 10\" toilet can, but there will be a 1\" gap with the wall Is the horow one-piece toilet free return if quality or broken?

                "reviewText": "First off, this toilet looks great, is well made, works well, and fits into a small space. That's a lot to ask for, apparently, because the brands at the big box stories are all at least two inches (or likely more) longer.I was initially worried about the toilet seat on the round model. It has a plenty large enough opening, but the seat is narrow, so I thought that thin people with a bony bottom might feel a little uncomfortable during longer uses. However, after using it for a while, my wife and I actually find it very comfortable. Also, note that we bought the more expensive toilet seat from the same company, which is sturdy and worth it. The one that comes with it is pretty cheap feeling and flimsy (odd because the rest of the toilet seems very sturdy). You can NOT find a toilet seat size at the store that will fit this small toilet.The toilet was pretty easy to install. The washers that came with it were too small, but the toilet flange bolts were thick and of solid quality. Oh, the toilet comes with a sink hose adapter attached for some reason. It's easy enough to remove the adapter and use a standard toilet hose, but I had to make an unnecessary trip to the hardware store because I didn't read the instructions the first time and didn't notice that I could remove it at first.Flushing power seems good so far for #1 and #2, although we haven't really \"challenged\" it yet. So far, it has also stayed clean, so the drop zone is apparently well placed, at least for us.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. In my house, I have a tiny bathroom that doesn't have room for an elongated toilet so this HOROW HWMT-8733 Small Compact One Piece Toilet was replacing a classic round toilet. The problem that I'd always had with the original toilet was that it was uncomfortable to use because of its size.The HOROW features a one-piece design with a dual flush system to save water. It was also described as small and compact which is why I was kinda worried about whether the HOROW would actually be a good replacement because it is also a compact toilet.Installation was very straightforward. Everything I needed was in the box, including the wax ring. The dual flush system was already installed so no additional work there. This toilet had standard fittings and I was able to replace the water pipes without an extra trip out to the hardware store. After installation, I found that this toilet took up even less floorspace, well it took up less physical space overall, than my original round toilet.The flush system needed a bit of adjustment (check my video) to ensure that the button can reach the flush mechanism enough to ensure that it flushed, but after that, everything worked smoothly. I love the dual flush system because the small flush uses less water and because of that, the tank refills super quickly. Flushing the toilet at night will no longer wake anyone up.Speaking of being quiet, this toilet's flush system is really quiet. Much quieter than my original toilet, which I've tried to quiet down through various toilet fill systems. The soft close lids also help to ensure that no one is woken up by a loud bang at night.So to answer the concern I mentioned at the beginning of this review, the HOROW toilet is a bit narrower but it is actually long enough to where it actually felt more comfortable than my original round toilet.This is a good toilet. It fixed a lot of problems I had with my original toilet and actually gave me more space in my tiny bathroom.",

                "reviewText": "Great looking and small size dual flush toilet here. Too expensive honestly at $250, but hey, there aren't many options for this size in a smaller dual flush and separate tank design. Easy to install.The seat is a bit wobbly though and I worry about it. Just like all the other reviews state. I'm afraid if you aren't perfectly still when sitting on the toilet that the seat keepers will eventually break and a replacement seat is waaaaay too expensive. Crappy.Excellent looking toilet though and other than the seat design it would be a perfect toilet.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased two toilets for my home. One is a Toto Drake 1.6 gpf and the other this toilet that I am reviewing. I am impressed with the quality. The glazing is excellent and applied to the entire exterior. This is unlike the Toto, which does not glaze the back of the tank. I think the quality of the glazing is superior to the Toto, which is surprising. Toto has the reputation of being the best, but this toilet seems like higher quality, at least with the glazing.Bothe this toilet and the Toto Drake use siphoning action for flushing. The Toto has two \u201ctornado\u201d outlets that swoosh around the bowl. This toilet has maybe 30 holes distributed around the rim, like a traditional toilet. But these are angled, so the water comes out and swooshes the entire bowl very effectively. Better than the Toto, frankly. The Toto requires frequent cleaning as its flushing action doesn\u2019t \u201cget it all.\u201d This toilet does a super job, which is great since it is in a tight guest bathroom. This toilet is small but roomy. Oh, get the model that has the upgraded seat. It won\u2019t slide around. Another plus and indicator of quality is that this toilet sits flat on the floor, no rocking. Not quite true of the Toto. Both are fine toilets, but I have to give the edge to this small one-piece over the Toto.Final note: you\u2019ll notice several other brands of what seems like the same, small, one-piece toilet. They are at different price points. I think it likely that they are all made in the same Chinese factory, but to different quality standards. I\u2019m impressed with this particular brand, and I\u2019ll buy this same model again for my small office bathroom.",
