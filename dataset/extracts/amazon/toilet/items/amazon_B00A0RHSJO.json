                "reviewText": "First of all\u2026 no one knows how much they need this until they have this. It\u2019s life changing. There is no downside. You use wayyy less toilet paper. Pays for itself in a year because you\u2019ll make a roll last 2-3 weeks.Second, it cleans so well that you will feel dirty if you have to take a dump at work where they have no bidet. You\u2019ll wanna cry because you will NEED a bidet.Also worth noting\u2026 if you have a bad back and have trouble wiping at times, this will save your back. It\u2019s also good for the elderly who can\u2019t shower a lot and struggle to wipe thoroughly. This does most of the job for you. Very practical.Third, (this is for the ladies\u2026 sorry TMI) but it cleans all your lady bits. A nice refresher that makes you feel renewed. You just gotta position yourself correctly and set the stream for the lightest setting.For all you naysayers who are on the fence about getting your first bidet, just do it. This unit is cheap and easy to install. The worst case scenario is that you hate it (you won\u2019t) and you\u2019re out a few bucks. This is soooo worth it. I\u2019ve bought theses for two other people. Both were annoyed with me for buying them such an awkward gift, but installed them anyway after a year of me hassling them. They both RAVE about it now.Anyone who doesn\u2019t have a bidet is a barbarian. This is the only way to live. Had mine two years now and will never live without one now. This particular unit is rock solid. No problems whatsoever. I never felt like I needed a heated bidet. This works just fine. Not too cold (and I live in a cold region with cold well water) I\u2019ve had no issues with the temperature of my water.Do you love your hiney? If so, be nice to it and get a bidet.",

                "reviewText": "I recently added the LUXE Bidet NEO 120 to my bathroom, and it has quickly become an essential part of my daily routine. This non-electric bidet attachment for my toilet seat has transformed my personal hygiene experience, and I'm excited to share the numerous benefits it offers.First and foremost, the installation process was surprisingly straightforward for many users, but I must admit that in my specific case, it posed some challenges due to my unique toilet setup. While I'm no DIY expert, the bidet attachment installation was a bit tricky for me, primarily because of my toilet's design and plumbing. This may not be a universal issue, but it's worth noting that your experience with installation might vary depending on your toilet configuration.Despite the installation challenges, I managed to set up the NEO 120, and it has been a game-changer ever since. The self-cleaning nozzle provides peace of mind in terms of hygiene, as it ensures that the nozzle remains clean and ready for use. This feature, combined with the adjustable water pressure and spray angle, provides a customized and thorough clean that simply can't be achieved with traditional toilet paper.The fresh water supply is a refreshing change. It eliminates the need for electricity or batteries, making the NEO 120 eco-friendly and cost-effective. The fresh water spray leaves you feeling clean and refreshed, which is especially wonderful during hot weather or after a rigorous workout.The bidet attachment is durably built and works seamlessly. The quality is evident in its sturdy construction and the way it operates smoothly without any hiccups. It's a reliable and long-lasting addition to my bathroom.In terms of comfort, the NEO 120 is a game-changer. The adjustable water temperature (if you have access to warm water) and the gentle stream of water are incredibly comfortable and soothing. It's like a spa experience right in your own bathroom.In conclusion, the LUXE Bidet NEO 120 is a must-have for anyone looking to upgrade their personal hygiene routine. While installation may pose challenges for some due to unique toilet setups, it's worth the effort. The NEO 120 provides a clean, comfortable, and refreshing experience that leaves you wondering how you ever lived without it. I can't recommend the NEO 120 enough; it's a fantastic addition to any bathroom and a worthwhile investment in your daily comfort and hygiene.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars I never thought I needed it -- until I tried it",
                "reviewText": "I am a middle-aged male, quite simple and middle class (I don't typically eat foods I can't pronounce or drive a car I can't afford), and I consider myself hygienic but not OCD when it comes to that. I've never been one for lotions and potions for daily hygiene. I'm a bar of soap and bottle of cheap shampoo kind of guy.This product changed that for the better. If you feel such a device is \"weird\" or \"odd,\" well if you consider it in an honest way, many of the most interesting and surprising (in a good way) things in life can be weird or odd at first.The device (Neo 120) functions as advertised, for the most part \u2013 see below -- and works very, very well. I must say emphatically up front that I did *NOT* receive this item for free or for a discount for my \u201chonest and unbiased review,\u201d nor do I work for the company that makes this device, nor own stock in said company. I have nothing to gain but good karma for relaying my feelings about this so you can make up your own mind:\u2022 Installation to the water supply is easy. (If you read ignorant, misleading reviews that claim this device gets its water from the toilet tank (or worse, the bowl), ignore such misinformation). It uses the same water source as the rest of the fresh water in your house, and anyone who actually owns one knows that. When installing the water supply hose to the water feed side and then the bidet, it needs to be tightened snug \u2013 not torqued down with a wrench. The latter is totally unnecessary and instead of preventing leaks, it may very well cause them. If you are concerned about leaks, it does come with plumber\u2019s tape\u2014not much, but enough for the job.\u2022 As others have said, installation onto the toilet itself can be tricky, especially if your toilet seat dips in the back. Imagine completely removing your toilet seat (both lids), and then placing three stacked quarters next to both holes before putting the seat back on. That is about the elevation that results. DO purchase some cheap white plastic toilet seat hinge bolts that are as long as you can find \u2013 3 inches or so. Those will be needed, and I am surprised this wasn\u2019t issued as formal guidance in the instructions. (If you want nicer bolts, then sure, but no one really sees those. It\u2019s about utility for something like this). This advice is based on my standard toilet. If you have a specialty toilet that normally wouldn\u2019t be a \u201cstandard\u201d model in a typical big-box home improvement store, you should investigate further before you buy.\u2022 The temperature of the water that comes out of this is precisely the temperature of the cold water that comes out of your faucet. The temperature is whatever is in the pipe. If you live in a hot climate where the ground remains hot almost year around, the water will be warmer. If the water that comes out of your cold tap is normally seemingly freezing, so too will the water that comes out of this device. The company makes another more advanced \u201cbells and whistles\u201d model if you want to hook it to your cold AND hot water supply. I did not think I needed that feature \u2013 installation is a LOT more complicated, for one \u2013 and now that I am using it, I\u2019m glad I decided the way I did. If I lived in a cold climate, I would consider the more advanced model with a hot/cold water blend and not just cold tap (i.e., the Neo 120 model that I have).\u2022 Contrary to other reviews, the device will not drill you a brand new door on your backside, nor will it violently launch you smashing your skull into the opposite wall in a watery, shameful mess. That\u2019s fun reading, but it\u2019s not fact-based. Whatever your water pressure (cold tap), then that\u2019s what you get \u2013 which is adjustable with the topmost dial. (But that has a downside \u2013 see below)\u2022 This device will save you money on toilet paper. For sure. \u201cDo you still use toilet paper,\u201d someone might ask. Yes. Yes I do. But it\u2019s much less about cleaning and much more about drying off when using one of these.\u2022 I\u2019m sorry to be gross, but even for a guy like me, handsfree washing of the back bumper is HIGHLY preferred to smearing around your trash like car wax. There is a reason why \u201csnobs\u201d love these things. Did this product make me a bit more of a snob as well? I don't know, but if it did, I'm now a snob and that's fine by me.\u2022 It also saves on your stain remover costs. Think white underwear. See bullet point above.\u2022 Aesthetically it is quite nice. I don\u2019t have guests over in the middle of a pandemic, but once I do in the future, I will be interested in their potential interest. Think about it. You are a guest in someone\u2019s home and you see this. The door is locked. It's just you. Why not give it a try? \ud83d\ude0a\u2022 The price is very reasonable for what you get. The parts that could flood your house (water connections) are METAL and appear strong. There is no need for a wrench, which is very useful at breaking things not designed to withstand one.What I don\u2019t like:\u2022 Installation (of the product onto the toilet, not the water connection) can be tricky depending on your current setup. I recommend a package of those cheap, long plastic hinge bolts. (The metal ones you likely have now are probably really gross as well, so replacement won\u2019t hurt. In my case, my existing screws were 1) far too short with the bidet wedged in, and 2) gross.\u2022 The little white swinging \u201cdoor\u201d that inserts down into the bowl (but not the water in the bowl) forms a barrier. When in \u201cclean\u201d mode (bottommost dial, 3:00 position), the spout will spray water, not on your back bumper, but on that back of that little door. In \u201cwash\u201d mode (bottom dial, 12:00 position), the spout will drop down below the door to work. All of this is automatic. What I do *not* like is the \u201ccatch\u201d for the door. When sitting on the seat, the little door sometimes flies open (which impedes operation), and sometimes the water pressure in cleaning mode will pop it open as well. This is a prime area of design improvement in my view. The only reason this door exists is for nozzle cleaning, either the machine doing it in cleaning mode or you manually opening the little door to manually clean the spray nozzle. Yeah \u2013 wear gloves. I see the appeal of these features, but there must be a better design that would accomplish the same result.\u2022 The water pressure control dial reminds me of the clutch on the riding lawn mower I used when I was 15. I would *ease* off the clutch and the mower would inch forward and come to speed. But if I did more than ease off it, the front wheels would clear the ground. Same here. The knob turn distance between 1% flow and 75% flow in this device is very limited. (This is due to the valve design, another sure place for improvement). The distance between 75% and 100% water flow on the knob is really the majority of the turn. (The valve moves from 12:00 to about 3:00 position). Go easy on this dial, especially at first. So if the full turn of the knob is 12:00 to 3:00, 50 % water pressure is like at 12:30. Anything beyond 1:00 is full pressure all the way to 3:00.\u2022 This has nothing to do with the functionality of the product, but some people shop less for utility and more for aesthetics. More color choices would appeal to such buyers. This is free advice to the company.Overall, the device is something I have faithfully used every day since installation (so, a bit over a month). I never thought I needed it until I had it. Next I may even switch to bottled soap instead of bars.Five stars.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the Luxe Bidet Neo 120 nearly 1 year ago and I couldn't be happier with my decision. This bidet attachment has transformed my bathroom experience, and I'm excited to share my thoughts with you.First and foremost, the design of this bidet attachment is sleek and modern, instantly giving my bathroom a high-end look. The high-quality construction with metal/ceramic cores and steel hoses, rather than cheap plastic, assures me that this product is built to last. It's clear that Luxe Bidet values both aesthetics and durability.One of the standout features of the Luxe Bidet Neo 120 is the hygienic nozzle guard gate. It provides an added layer of cleanliness and peace of mind, ensuring that the nozzle remains protected between uses. The automatic retraction of the nozzle behind the guard gate is a thoughtful touch that enhances the overall sanitary experience.Installation was a breeze, and I appreciated that all the necessary parts and tools were included. In just a few minutes, I had it attached to my standard two-piece toilet. It's rust-proof and corrosion-proof, which means I won't have to worry about replacing it anytime soon.But perhaps the most impressive aspect of this bidet attachment is its eco-friendliness. Not only does it reduce the need for toilet paper, helping to save money and trees, but it's also gentle on the skin. The fresh water cleaning is both effective and comfortable, making it a worthwhile investment for both your wallet and the planet.Lastly, the 18-month warranty is the cherry on top. Knowing that Luxe Bidet stands behind their product and is readily available for support if needed is reassuring.In conclusion, the Luxe Bidet Neo 120 is a game-changer for any bathroom. It combines style, hygiene, ease of installation, environmental consciousness, and excellent customer support in one fantastic package. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade their bathroom experience.",
