                "reviewText": "This is a great product and contraption! Once you get used to a bidet you might not want to ever go back to TPs. You will however need a bit less TP.Installation appears easy at first and may be so for those with some background in plumbing. If not, it will take a bit of courage and finesse to install. My first install ended up with some leakage and could not fix the problem initially. I wanted to call a plumber and that would have cost me about $150 extra for installing both in two bathrooms. I slept over it and thought about it and figured I could get this thing done without the help of a plumber. Only problem was leaks and difficult working space ie location of the pipes for connections. On my second attempt, I got it down to a droplet leak every five minutes or so. I almost said I could live with it. Slept over it and did it again, the following day BUT this time I used Rectorseal T Plus 2 Pipe Thread Sealant from Home Depot and pipe sealant tape (included in order). That did the trick and voila.After that, installing the second bidet was a roughly 30 minute job since the work space and location of pipe joints wasn't that easy to get to and work with. Also having the right tools really helps. The plastic stuff included in the order don't work as well if any. Can anyone install this Bidet? Yes,even without any background in plumbing. Just make sure you read and understand the instructions before you start. Make sure you know exactly where the hot water connection on both ends are located. I had connected the hot to the cold and had to redo it which took some time. Overall I learned a bit of plumbing, saved $150 in plumbing costs and now have an inexpensive bidet that can become addictive to use.Get one and install it. BTW it takes a minute before the hot water reaches the contraption, so if your toilet is far from the hot water heater you may want to run the water in the sink before you go. Alternatively get used to the cold water, and if you can; than you will not need the hot and cold water version. If the hot water heater is near the bathroom you may just need to plug the hot water and leave the cold out. Once you install it, play with it until you learn the best way to enjoy the device. In hot areas of the country, there is no need for the hot water version. Thus for less than 30 bucks you could save tons on toilet paper. Enjoy the bidet!",

There was things I didnt like about the last one so I read all the information before selecting this one . This one was a little bit more difficult to install I couldnt do it myself ! So , my dad and husband took on the project it didnt take them to long before they had it up and running ! I love the fact it you can control the temperature and the presure ! It had a womens and a booty button ! Super easy to use ! Its pretty quiet ! The only thing I dont like about it may take a little bit of time to warm up so I turn it on light so it can be warm on the bottom ! For the price point I do recommend this one !!!",

                "reviewText": "The product itself works great. The instructions were easy to follow but the kit needs 2 things before you get started.1. You need to buy 1/8th \" thick metal washers in order to make the toilet seat higher in the back than the bidet unit itself or else you will crack the plastic housing. I added 2x 1/8th \" washers to the toilet seat bolts to keep the seat from putting pressure on the bidet unit.2. Get a set of toilet seat extenders before you begin or you will break your seat trying to sit on it.I drilled two holes in the bathroom cabinet and then using all the material in the kit I did the installation.The only other issue I ran into was the O/Ring Gasket that connected the T under the Toilet to the old Valve. The O/Ring came without a hole in it and I had to use a knife to cut a round hole in it so it would allow water to pass through to fill up the toilet tank. Otherwise it would have never allowed water to pass through to the tank at all.Once everything was installed it worked like a dream and the heinee hine gets very clean now and we use a lot less TP.However my wife had to maneuver herself around to find the correct positioning. She is short and the toilet is a tall unit to begin with. So I got a small step stool we had and put it in the bathroom for her to put her feet up on and now it all is aiming correctly. This may be a good suggestion if you have a tall toilet so that kids and short adults can use it properly.",

                "reviewText": "until everyone began hording toilet paper because of COVID-19 in early 2020, I never would've thought of using a product like this. Of course, now that it's installed, I can't imagine going back to the \"old ways\"!!I don't have any previous experience with this kind of product, but I can definitely recommend this model because it self-cleans, you can adjust the pressure and especially because you can ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE. The fact that it also self cleans and has two sprays makes it even better.Installation was easy, and simple. The directions were exact and easy to read and follow. All parts are high quality and I like that product is shipped with protective caps over the threads of the connectors to protect from damage and also from losing parts. The hot water line is more than long enough so you can trim it to length, and all parts appear to be made from high grade materials. The joints all fit perfectly and with a bit of plumbing tape (included with the kit) there were no leaks or drips.You can't really put a price on comfort, but in savings of TP alone this will no doubt pay for itself in just a few months. Highly recommended!!",
