        "description": "The TOTO WASHLET C2 Elongated Electric Bidet Toilet Seat with PREMIST delivers ecology-minded luxury with a streamlined design. Unlike traditional toilet paper that can often be rough and ineffective, the WASHLET quickly provides comfortable warm water cleansing at the touch of a button. Part of the newly redesigned C Series, the WASHLET C2 is fully automated, featuring a soft rear spray, rear cleanse, and front cleanse with the option of an oscillating stream. The controls are located on a convenient arm control panel. The PREMIST function sprays the bowl with water before each use, preventing waste buildup and keeping the toilet bowl clean. The C2 model utilizes TOTO's EWATER+ system when the wand self-cleans. EWATER+ uses electrolyzed water generated by a technologically advanced process, transforming the water into a safe and powerful compound. This cleaning technology helps to keep create peace of mind by cleaning the inside and outside of the wand before and after every use. The C2 WASHLET features a heated SoftClose seat with three temperature settings. The temperature and pressure of the water are adjustable with three temperature settings and five pressure settings. The WASHLET features an air deodorizer and a warm air dryer with three temperature settings. Using a WASHLET reduces the need for toilet paper, saving trees and water used to manufacture each roll. As we get older, reduced mobility, medical conditions, and debilitating illnesses can make it increasingly hard to clean ourselves after using the toilet. With a WASHLET, just the touch of a button can leave you feeling clean and refreshed. Easy to install and includes mounting and connection hardware.",

This C2 Toto does not have that button, which is fine for me.They are a bit spendy so it took me a while to finally break down and buy one now that I\u2019m back in the states. I also hesitated because I thought it\u2019d be difficult to set up, but it\u2019s super straightforward! (I\u2019m happy my bathroom has an outlet so close to the toilet!)I got the oval shaped/elongated washlet and it fits perfectly!The Premist and deodorizer work like a charm, and I like the warm seat and soft closing lid features! The dryer works as it should and is nice but I imagine you\u2019d have to sit for more than a few minutes to get fully dry, and I\u2019m impatient so toilet paper is still needed, just less of it!I\u2019m super satisfied with the Toto brand washlet!! <3TOTO\u306e\u30a6\u30a9\u30b7\u30e5\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u3068\u3066\u3082\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3059\uff01\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u5b09\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002",

Once hooked up the seat took a few minutes to warm up but once it was it was nice and roasty. The pressure performance is great. The heated water tank works great for nearly any use case. If you sit there for a bit sure it will get cold but under normal daily use you will never get to the cold water. I also have products from the big K company name found this offered much better performance. I will only buy Toto brand toilet products moving forward.",

                "reviewText": "First off, installing this bidet didn't take too much time once I read the instructions and it clearly explains what you need to do. My toilet is not from Toto, and I didn't have issues attaching the base plate and seat. Let's just say that my family loved it. Everything is luxury to me as this would be the first time I owned a bidet with warm seat, a controllable nozzle, dryer, mist that sprays when you sit on the bowl, self cleaning. Although I find the dryer kind of weak, which I was expecting a little more out of it. It does reduces toilet paper consumption as you could get your rear dry to a point and finish it off with a small amount of toilet paper. For women though, I don't think the dryer will be enough for the front. So a small toilet paper will be used to wipe dry. The water pressure isn't super strong, but, if you adjust the position of the spray, it will make a difference.I don't care about the deodorizer, as I wouldn't want to replace a filter for it, but, if it's very stink, it would be nice to use it. Another thing I loved is the fact that the soft cover closes quietly and covers the seat completely as to prevent germs from escaping. So sanitizing the cover will be nice to do every once in awhile. I would give them another star if the dryer has settings to increase the strength cause it feels a little weak. To dry your rear a little quicker, angle it a little at the dryer. Otherwise I think I made a good choice for a bidet and the warm seat and water is a must for colder climates and especially during winter and early spring.This will definitely reduce toilet paper consumption unless you have diarrhea or constipation, I would use toilet paper still. Otherwise, this is a great buy",

                "reviewText": "Say goodbye to using TP. With the blow dryer option, I no longer have to use any TP. I feel much cleaner too compared to using TP. I recommend getting it for around $300, set a price alert. These units usually come down to $300 for a couple of days then back up to the $350 plus range.I don't use the deodorizer option that much bc it's just mainly me who is using the bathroom. I do like the soft close feature and the seat warmer is really nice.The premist option is also lovely. I hate it when the kaka is stuck to the walls, but with the premist option, the kaka just falls right down. :DThe heated water is great. When the water shoots up, it feels so good with the warm water, the feeling is soothing.Do yourself a favor, and buy this Toto. I was blown away at the quality of Totos when I was in Japan. They are truly the gold standard in bidets. You won't regret getting one of these. I went from a regular bidet that just sprayed water to this fully featured one and it's like riding a bike then driving a car.",

                "reviewText": "This accessory does everything I had hoped for, it keeps the seat warm, it warms the water, the dryer works well and is an easy install, last it looks really nice on our bowl. I did notice that due to the mount the hole is alot smaller so you are sitting very close to the front edge. If this is something that bother you I would strongly recommend you keep this in mind and look at the product measurements.",
