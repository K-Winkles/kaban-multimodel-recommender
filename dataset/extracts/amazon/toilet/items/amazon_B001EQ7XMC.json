They can handle a big load using a rather small amount of water. I don't think the seat is quite as comfortable as the one on the more expensive Toto we already had, but it's fine. One small hiccup was that after we picked a delivery date when we could be home, Amazon changed the delivery to an earlier date, and we had to call the delivery company to straighten that out. The same thing later happened with a TV delivery. I wish Amazon would recognize that customers pick delivery dates for a reason and not arbitrarily change them.",

                "reviewText": "April 2015 update:After four years of use, one of the Cadet-3 toilets started to refill on its own every half hour. I tried a few modifications adjusting the bob height, but realizing that it was due to some other issue I ordered a complete internal plastics replacement. What was fantastic is that purchasing the exact parts from Amazon American Standard 738942-1010A CADET3 COMPACT FLUSH VLV 1.28GPF (GREEN) and the American Standard 738565-409.0070A Water Control Assembly, 12-Inch High with 28 Percent Refill were very inexpensive and fit perfectly. All done without a plumber. The leak is gone, and the cost was cheaper than for my local plumber to come out and look at it.February 2013:I purchased two of these American Standard Compact Cadet-3 FloWise One-Piece Toilets as a water saving replacement to our 1950's American Standards that were original to our house.This pair of toilets were purchased for the following reasons:*water savings*performance of evacuation compared to alternates*looks*big available rebates by the water district (only available within the district if the toilet was on an authorized toilet purchase list, so I recommend locating any rebates first before purchase if this will influence which product that you buy)*the balance of positive reviews (even with a few negative experiences)All goals were achieved. The single piece was more expensive, but better than the two piece alternatives in my view. I hate extra seals and points of leakage. The toilet refills very fast, because it uses so much less water. I wish we had done the replacement years ago. The local rebates made this purchase a complete success at little cost.These two toilets have not had any leaks. Cleaning has been much easier than the old ones that were replaced. There is not much here to do but compliment this product.Plus, they were very easy to install. A great DIY project. The toilets arrived in boxes on pallets in perfect shape.I have noticed a great change in the home water usage, as expected. This has happened even with a few re-flushes. It isn't required as much as I thought it would to clear the bowl. I should describe it as rare.",

                "reviewText": "This toilet is perfect. It works better than any new or old toilet I've ever seen or tested, it is compact everywhere except the seat, it looks nice and it is incredibly inexpensive (compared with what most people are spending on new toilets). I needed to get a new toilet. I'd seen &used the new lower water use toilets at other peoples' home. They varied from notvery good (less water in the bowl, but you have to flush 5 times to clear it), to terrible (even endless flushing couldn't deal with the smears). I spent ages researching toilets. Learned you shouldn't buy any toilet that hadn't been summited for a MAP score. Then I poured over buyer reviews. This toilet clears a tremendous amount with one flush. And there is no smear problem at all. (I believe work was done on creating a surface finish to stop this happening, and making the shape of the bowl better too - whatever was done, it works 100%)Zero.It's a one piece, but not that heavy. It's compact, but with an elongated bowl (i.e. better for larger people) and is higher than a normal seat (good for older people), but not massively so. The compact size, and it's being one piece means it is very good where space is limited. It sticks out from the wall much less than a 2 piece would, or a non compact one piece. And the cistern is compact -narrow from side to side, and from top to bottom. But the main thing is: this is a water efficient toilet that really is efficient. No need for multiple flushes, and it keeps really clean. I can't recommend it enough. Didn't know the US still had a co. that could innovate properly and make a really good modern product.Looks wise it's a pleasant blend of somewhat traditional in style with clean unobtrusive lines. (I learned to avoid the retro look toilets....most of them haven't even been submitted for MAP testing.)Again..superb work on American Standard's part.",
