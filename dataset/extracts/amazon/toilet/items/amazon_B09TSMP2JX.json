You'll need a 1/2\" faucet fill line. Simple trip to the hardware store and you're all set. Also you're going to want to have a helper when you go to install it. The bolts are hidden inside the base of the toilet so it's almost impossible to line up the holes with the bolts when lowering it unless you have two mirrors and good lighting.",
