The seat goes down easily on its own, very quiet. Flush is fast, fills fast, and better than my other American Standard toilet! Deer Valley really cares about their customer, as the packaging was outstanding to insure that the products gets to you safely without damage. The only thing you need to buy separately, is a water line toilet hose. Everything else in the description is included. I will be purchasing other products from them in the future.",
