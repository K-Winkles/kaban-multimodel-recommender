                "reviewText": "This fulfilled our needs at a great price-my poor child was spending 30min plus trying to get \u201cclean\u201d in the bathroom after going #2, and using about a half of a toilet paper roll each time. We tried flushable wipes but they were causing plumbing problems, and taking a shower immediately afterwards was not always practical. So I decided to take the plunge and buy a bidet, but given that this is our first time buying I wanted to start with a cheaper option just in case we ran into problems.It was fairly easy to install, the only leaking I experienced was from a water line that was in place before the we began installation, I recommend making sure all fittings are tight-even the existing ones you did not change, as they can be worked loose when moving them during installation.After I *hand* tightened all the fixtures, I put a large white paper towel on the floor beneath all of the connections to be able to easily monitor for any leaks (a drop of water changes the color and opacity of a paper towel to make spotting leaks a piece of cake).And so far, I\u2019m good to go after fixing that first leak! The water pressure is realllllly strong coming out of the bidet, so I will be turning down the water pressure on the water cut-off, and unfortunately no matter how far back I push the bidet, it causes the toilet seat to sit up waaay too far, even using the supplied bumpers there is a large gap at the front of the toilet seat.My workaround is as follows: I have ordered some white \u201crubber toilet seat hinge washers\u201d, and I will probably end up using about 3-4 per hinge, to help level things out.All-in-all, it was a great deal, it works as advertised, installation was fairly straightforward and I\u2019m happy with my purchase!",

My issue is the product is not what\u2019s picture. In the picture it shows it being one piece. It actually came in two pieces. That I had to connect without any kind of screw. So it doesn\u2019t stay put together. I had to tape it down. I\u2019m not sure if I have to buy another toilet seat because I\u2019m not able to put the covers on where the toilet seat it\u2019s place. The front part wash completely shoots right out from underneath the toilet seat. So I\u2019m not goin to use that option. It comes with seat bumpers that I\u2019m totally confused about. The back wash works well. Overall easy installation. Looks pretty. It\u2019s doin it job I guess. Maybe you guys would have a better luck",
