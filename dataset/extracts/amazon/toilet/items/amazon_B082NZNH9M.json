                "reviewText": "I love this bidet, and it was very easy to install. I will be honest that I hesitated, because the whole process just seemed very intimidating. It\u2019s not bad.What I love about the bidet is that it doesn\u2019t need to be hooked up to anything else besides the toilet and the pipe. Just make sure that you read the instructions carefully and you watch the video provided on Amazon. You will be fine.I use the bidet on myself and if the water is cold in the pipes, you will be using cold water on yourself. It is not temperature regulating.I also use a bidet to clean my bathroom. I love how strong the stream is and yes, you can control the stream. I will scrub my bathtub or let bleach sit on everything for a little while, and spray everything down using the bidet. This is honestly the best thing I have purchased for my bathroom.Just remember to close the valve when you\u2019re not using it otherwise you\u2019re at risk of having a leak as per instructions.",
