                "reviewText": "While the ST03 plus is an upgraded model with auto open/close seats I would like to discuss the comparisons in set up. plusI received both toilets at the same time, one for the primary room (ST03) the other for the second bedroom (TC-100GE). On opening the boxes it looked like the ST03 plus was more inclusive of needed materials. It contained everything except the tools. Items contained were t-value, remote, 2 AA batteries, wax ring, 1 9V battery, water measuring bag, mounting template, mounting bolts and nuts, washers and bolts. Canest contained remote, wax ring, angle valve, installation cardboard. However, batteries needed to be purchased separately..Uncle Brown\u2019s while seeming more complete has significant problems. The T-value had unusual threads and was not useable on my set up requiring purchase of a t-valve. I saw other owners had a similar problem with their valves also in these reviews. Another issue was that I purchased this toilet because I want the emergency flush capabilities. It requires a 9V battery. The problem is, as other reviews noted removing the toilet cover is not an easy task and there are no videos or instructions on how to do it. Furthermore the last line in the instructions says: \u201cIf the battery needs to be replaced, it is recommended to contact your local dealer to have it replaced by specialized personnel.\u201d So, is the new owner supposed to find someone to add the battery? Why can\u2019t the company provide a video on how to add the emergency 9V battery. (None of the current videos offer any suggestions, although a few mention the 9V battery). I agree with other reviewers this need to be done.The Canest 9V is easy to install and easy to replace. The problem with this toilet was it required the purchase of a flange spacer as the toilet would not sit on the current spacer and allow the installation accessory brackets to be attached to it. Not everyone may have this problem. The angle valve on this toilet fits very well no unusual threads.Beyond these installation problems I really like both toilets. Yes the ST03 is a bit more upgraded then the Canest TC-100GE but both are great. I should mention that I decided to get the ST03 when it went on sale for Black Friday so it was only $100 more than the Canest.I really like my new bathroom experience and I wonder why these toilets were not in the US before.",
