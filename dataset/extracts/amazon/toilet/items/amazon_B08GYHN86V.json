However, I purchased this one for my guest bathroom toilet that does not have the bidet (as this seat can be used in either situation). The seat is extremely easy to install, and installs very snug and tight to the bowl. It also allows for adjustments so that you can get the seat perfectly centered on the bowl (in case the bolt holes of the toilet were not cast perfectly). The plastic is high quality and not flimly, and the rubber bumpers on the bottom allow for the seat to have full, soft contact with the rim of the bowl. The best part is that when you lift the seat to the raised position, you can simply remove it from the anchor posts for easy cleaning! When the seat is in any other position, it is locked onto the anchor bolts. Lifting it to the open position releases the \"lock\" so that you can lift it up to clean.",

The slow falling seat is nice and quite. It takes a little bit of force to pull the seat off the easy release hinges but it's pretty nice being able to remove the seat to clean. The hinges themselves also look really nice when the seat is fully down.",

Pulled the trigger on this seat and it fit perfectly. Comfortable seat too.The only weird thing is that it gets this black powder-like residue built up on the bottom of the seat. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s because it\u2019s near the heater or not, but my old seat never did that. It has gotten better over time, but still happens.",

                "reviewText": "I decided to upgrade my well used Luxe neo 120 bidet with the newer designed Luxe 120 neo PLUS after years of problem free use. (The Luxe 120 Neo PLUS bidet has a new feature of tilting up to clean bidet easier.)I was looking for a seat that Luxe made for their bidets because I was un-impressed with just using a my old seat with sticker bumpers, they are harder to clean and come lose over time .Just follow the simple instructions that come with new seat for easy installation The luxe seat is a well designed seat for their bidets and does work well when seated on it. It feels comfortable and it does rest on all 4 bumper pads underneath when weight of person is seated on it. It was a easy installation after reading their instructions and does not move at all when a person is adjusting them self's to seat properly when wanting bidet water to hit a certain area of butt .It is also removable and easier to clean ceramic toilet area underneath + where the bumpers are on the luxe seat are a easier clean. It is just a much better seat than my $25 dollar cheap hardware store seat and highly recommend it for any Luxe bidet attachment !Very happy with using this toilet seat & is well thought out, Thanks Luxe!",

Good instructions made very easy I love it fits me great the soft close is a nice little axtra touch. I highly recommend this seat cost is worth every penny.",

This is perfectly compatible with the bidet, but not only that, it's also a very good seat. The installation is simple, and its quick release system is convenient. I found that it doesn't move to the sides at all while sitting (my past two seats had this issue even if I tightened the screws a lot). I also love the slow close. Really recommend this, especially with the bidet.",
