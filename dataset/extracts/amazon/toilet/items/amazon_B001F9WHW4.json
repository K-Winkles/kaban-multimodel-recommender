        "description": "Product Description The TOTO Eco UltraMax One-Piece Elongated 1.28 GPF ADA Compliant Toilet projects TOTO\u2019s mark of excellence: \u201cPeople Planet Water.\u201d The TOTO Eco UltraMax features a sleek, one-piece design that will immediately beautify the appearance of your bathroom. The one-piece design is not only aesthetically pleasing, but also offers the benefit of being easier to clean versus a two-piece toilet. By removing the gap between the tank and bowl, we eliminate the hiding place for dirt and debris. An additional benefit of the one-piece toilet is that there is no threat of leaks from bolts or gaskets that can occur in two-piece toilets. The TOTO Eco UltraMax utilizes TOTO\u2019s E-Max flushing system. The E-Max flushing system features a 3\u201d wide flush valve, extra-large siphon jet, and a large trapway. This reliable, highly efficient combination generates a powerful cleansing flush while only using 1.28 gallons of water. This version of the TOTO Eco UltraMax is a reflection of TOTO\u2019s People-Centered Design, complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility guidelines while maintaining the beauty and innovation expected from TOTO. The TOTO Eco UltraMax 1.28 GPF also meets the standards for EPA WaterSense , and California\u2019s CEC and CALGreen requirements. The TOTO Eco UltraMax has a left-hand chrome trip lever and an included TOTO SoftClose seat. From the Manufacturer ADA Height, sleek high profile elongated one piece toilet with 12-Inch rough-in. E-Max Low consumption (4.8 Lpf/1.28 Gpf) siphon jet flushing action. Tank cover, fittings, chrome plated trip lever and SoftClose seat included. E-Max is a simple and quiet solution for effectively flushing 1.28 gallons. Utilizing the same proven engineering as the legendary 1.6 GPF G-Max flushing system, the 1.28 GPF E-Max reinforces Toto's performance reputation while offering an additional water savings of 20 percent. E-Max features: Wide 3-Inch flush valve provides a quick, consistent and powerful flush. Large 2-1/8-Inch trapway is glazed to optimize waste passage. Pilot-operated fill valve ensures quiet operation and a clean shutoff at any water pressure. Extra-large siphon jet works in conjunction with the large glazed trapway; the siphon jet pulls away waste with incredible force. This toilet complies with ADA regulations for height. Toto's SoftClose seat is the latest in innovative smart seat technology with Comfortable Ergonomic Design, Molded Bumpers, and High Gloss Polypropylene. (Resistant to Chemicals and Cleaning Agents.) Constructed of solid, high-impact plastic, this unique seat is specifically designed to reduce injury and to eliminate annoying \"Toilet Seat Slam\". The seat and lid utilize a built-in SoftClose hinge system, which lowers the seat down to the bowl gently and quietly. The engineering of SoftClose incorporates Toto's high standard of quality and consumer ease. Top tightening mounting bolts ensure easy installation. And of course, all seats are precision designed to fit regular or elongated bowls.",

                "reviewText": "I did a lot of research on the internet before selecting the Toto toilet. There were other brands that were less money but after reading all the info felt that the Toto was the better toilet.We only installed it four days ago and so far have not had any reason to change my opinion. Toto makes a wonderful product. It is well made, has a quiet flush, uses so little water but flushes the bowl clean every time. Plus it comes with a soft-close seat (some toilets don't even come with a seat), that is well made and designed. The seat bracket comes with a fitted gasket so the seat doesn't slide on the porcelain....a little thing but it makes a difference in the quality of their product. It fits perfectly in our small bathroom even though it was a couple of inches longer than the old toilet. Absolutely love the one piece design as it makes it so much easier to clean....no more trying to clean the dirt that collects where the tank bolts to the toilet bowl in the two piece models.The toilet arrived in perfect condition. It was very well packaged and even came on a wooden pallet to provide extra protection.",

Installed one toilet no problem, installed the second toilet and went to put on the seat but one of the hinges were busted so the lid is floppy. I contacted home essentials for a replacement thinking they could send me a seat no big deal and if they wanted the broken one back I'd send it if they sent me a return label. Nope, they wanted me to uninstall the whole toilet, bring it to the post office and ship it back to them. Shipping that they expect me to pay for. They were extremely gracious because they did say they would waive the restocking fee for me.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the TOTO MS854114EL#01 Eco Ultramax ADA Elongated One Piece Toilet in Cotton White to replace our 16-year old Kohler toilet. Each of our three bathrooms now has a Toto toilet. We love the powerful flush of the toilet and the sleekness of this model, versus our Kohler toilet. Be cautioned, however, to the height of this toilet; the seat is 18 inches from the floor, so it sits two inches higher than our other ones. That fact still does not discount my rating of this toilet.",

                "reviewText": "We remodeled our previous house and used Toto toilets and were very happy with them. We've since sold that house, bought another one and ended up replacing 3 more toilets with Toto. They are easy to clean ( one piece), water efficient, and work great. We've never had an issue with floating stuff after flushing, even though it uses less water than most others. I highly recommend them.",

                "reviewText": "This is our second purchase of Toto, both from Amazon. The delivery is always on point. This is such a great toilet. With the tiniest little flush ever, you can\u2019t believe how effective it is at doing its job. Some home improvements just make your life a little bit better. The toilet itself is very large, but the tank is tiny and not quite flat on top - if you are used to setting stuff down on your tank lid, you can forget that habit, everything will just slide off.",
