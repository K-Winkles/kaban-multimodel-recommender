Although one exterior box arrived with a giant hole in the side and both boxes were left upside down, the toilet was not damaged. Very pleased. Good style, easy to install, quality glaze, stays clean, and is affordable. Seems to be clean with water only, which has been fine so far since it actually doesn't get very dirty to begin with. Flush is kind of loud, but fast to refill. A nice upgrade!",

And I picked up a nice Bemis elongated slow-close toilet seat/lid with nickel hinges (same as the other toilet) from Home Depot, since I used it on another toilet and liked the design, materials, and slow-close.Anyway, had my handyman brother install it with a Better Than Wax rubber gasket between the toilet and flange. Seemed like it was done relatively quickly. So, presumably, if you know what you're doing, it's reasonably easy to install?So far, I've not had to actually scrub / clean it yet. It's only been installed a week or so. But, so far no problems, no tank flange/seal leaks, no external drips/leaks, etc. Time will tell if any develop. But, so far, it seems to be doing nicely.Some advertising materials indicated a large \"water spot\" in the bowl [as opposed to some where there's nearly no water in the bowl], but I couldn't ever really get a good sense of what that meant from online materials. So, I've included a picture with the general water level in the bowl when the tank & bowl are filled and off, for reference, in case it helps anyone else.It's a reasonably large \"water spot,\" contra some where the water just sits down at the very bottom and the rest of the bowl is dry, which can lead to bits hanging on for dear life. So far, that hasn't been an issue with this toilet. In the old bowl (with regular rim holes that just point downward), it was. With the new bowl it has kinda' like two swirly jets from the tank toward the top of the bowl, with another jet that pushes stuff directly into the drain pipe and a relatively rimless design, and it's stayed pretty free of bowl debris so far. And it seems like it'll be easy to clean without having to guess whether the under-rim area is clean or not (since it doesn't have an overhang for stuff to get under, just the bowl sides and two water jet outlets that swirl water into the bowl). Whether it will remain free of clinging debris over the long term remains to be seen, but so far so good...Since it hasn't clogged yet, I can't tell if the space between the existing \"water spot\" [which takes up about half the bowl height (+/-)] and the lip of the bowl is sufficient to hold the water contents of the tank, if it did clog, or if it would overflow, strictly between the \"water spot\" + water from the tank. Kind of hope never to have to find out. (o_0)The tank seem to refill fairly quickly. Can't say whether it's louder or quieter than other tank refills. There's definitely refill sound. Don't know that I'd say that it's overly loud, which I guess means it's reasonably quiet. You definitely still hear it, so it's not like it's silent. But it's not terribly obtrusive and tends to be fairly quick, IMO.Overall, so far, I'm not disappointed by it. It's cleared everything I've put in it so far, as far as toilet paper and such and hasn't clogged one yet. Unlike the old small round toilet which would have a hard time clearing much of anything and frequently clogged with fairly, I think, average amounts of T.P. As far as that goes, I'm pleased so far, not having had to plunge it yet once. That's a nice change of pace. Hopefully that keeps up. Haven't explicitly tried flushing huge piles of T.P. like some advertising suggests it's capable of to see if it actually clogs, or of the swirling action successfully clears it. Maybe I'll try it sometime and get back to you... ;)",

                "reviewText": "Iv avoided buying a new toilet for so long, because the sewage pipe was just over 11\" from wall, and I still had a 3+ that gave a full flush almost everytime!! Well this new one is worth every penny, it even has a better flush with wat less water, it setback is perfect, and love the rimless bowl, so much easier to clean! No hidden spots, get the over price toilet seat with it.. it's worth the extra money! Also the tank lids flush, not over hanged.. give a clean look! I am worried about the flush Mechanism in the tank, it's a bit complex turn normal and probably will be $$ to replace, on average are water hard and have to replace the old ones every two to three years.. let's see how well it's holds up before I replace the other ones..",

Who wouldn't want that?These toilets are quite the upgrade to the cheap builder-installed toilets that were in the house. They're stylish, fit and finish is perfect and they have lots of features that make them easy to install and maintain. The height is perfect. And the \"Tornado Flush\" works great!Everything was pre-installed in the tank, too. Just install the tank on the lower half, hook up the water, put the lid on and have at it. All the parts seem to be really top quality and nothing required adjusting from how it was installed from the factory. It fills quickly and quietly.The installation instructions were clear and concise. The process was very easy. We're really happy with these toilets.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE on 12/7/2023:Still more impressed than I expected. I've had about a dozen people over my house that wanted to know the model number. How many people ever ask you about your toilet? For me, exactly ZERO - until I got this. And good luck clogging it. My three year old nephew thought it would be \"funny\" to flush a full sized hand towel down the toilet. We're taking a highly absorbent full sized bathroom hand towel. When my sister told me I was so upset, i almost threw up. I called my plumber and he told me to keep an eye on it and if it got backed up to turn off water and call him right away. Guess what? That was two weeks ago and many flushes ago. It did not clog. Let me say that again: A full sized hand towel did not clog this toilet. My old toilet clogged on two wads of toilet paper. This thing is a BEAST!ORIGINAL REVIEW:I did two months of research before replacing two new toilets. Spoke to every major toilet manufacturer. Many plumbers. The end result? The Toto Drake Elongated Standard Height. 1.6 gallon flush. Absolute perfection. Replaced junk 1.26 gallon 2000 year models and it's a difference of night and day. I could go into turbo flush power, almost silent flush, bowl washdown that cleans the bowl with every flush, virtual inability to clog, special coating that allows you to clean with just a wet rag and a little dish soap, seat comfort, etc etc but I\u2019m not going to. Just get this and look no further.",
