                "reviewText": "I see bidets for hundreds of dollars. I got this on a Black Friday deal for $35 as I\u2019ve never had one and this was so inexpensive I decided it was time to try one. As you can see there isn\u2019t much room to hook up but that\u2019s typical in bathrooms. The critical step is hooking up the supplied valve to the bottom of the toilet tank fill valve. I could have used an extra set of hands as the fill valve in the tank will want to spin when you are tightening the supplied valve onto the bottom of the tank. I suggest a channel lock and or adjustable wrench to tighten. It comes with a cone shaped gasket, make sure it\u2019s in there. As long as you get this connection properly tightened you are good to go. It was very simple but just working in a tight spot. Putting on the spray/water stream part under the ring is very simple and the water stream is very accurate. The on/off has a nice click so you know when you have it back in the off position. It has an adjustable water stream/pressure that you control by simply turning the knob more or less. I suggest not worrying about just using the cold water line that fills your toilet. I thought you might need warm water but was pleasantly surprised that the cold/tepid water from the existing toilet fill line was very very refreshing in that area. Don\u2019t get hung up on that. If I bought an expensive one I still wouldn\u2019t hook up hot water knowing what I know now. I have had no issues, no drips, no leaks and about a half hour install. Get things hooked up properly/ snug/tight and this thing is great.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to like this. It looks pretty simple and has a front wash setting.It was sinple to install. However, it doesn't really appear to fit our toilet the right way. We have a round shape and our toilet seat is weird so it's easy to swap out but it attaches in chunky latches, not a skinny part. I tried to fit the bidet loops over but then it doesn't flat because the part that hangs down won't reach the bowl. I think it's slightly too narrow or the round loops are slightly too small.I put the bumpers on so the bidet attachment won't be disturbed when we sit down on the seat. I'll try to fiddle with the toilet seat attachments and update my review if I can make any fit improvements.Well, it's on there and it's not leaking so far. Both the butt wash and the front wash seem to work but there's no \"gentle\" water pressure. Even when you turn the knob very slowly, it either doesn't spray hard enough to reach you or it blasts you.UPDATE: I watched a youtube video about how to install our Myfair removable toilet seat so I could figure out how to get it off again. I had the bidet plumbed in so I was determined to make it fit the toilet. I got in on here now and the lower part fits in the bowl like it should. It's flat against the toilet and doesn't need the bumpers. It works great when you're sitting on the toilet but still gets water on the floor if you try to test it with the lid shut. I'm bumping it up one star because it seems pretty good. I just wish the water pressure was adjustable. It's fine to power wash your bum but the front wash is a little too rough for my liking.",

                "reviewText": "La versi\u00f3n \"SlimEdge\" de este bid\u00e9 tiene un precio razonable y parece estar fabricado con alta calidad y durabilidad. Se suministra con un adaptador en T de metal que se conecta directamente debajo de la conexi\u00f3n de manguera est\u00e1ndar de 7/8 de pulgada en la cisterna (ver tercera foto). Luego, la manguera original se vuelve a conectar a la parte inferior del adaptador en T. Luego, la manguera de 1/2 pulgada revestida de metal se conecta al lado del adaptador en T y al conector debajo de la perilla de control del bid\u00e9. El bid\u00e9 es lo suficientemente delgado como para caber debajo de la conexi\u00f3n del asiento existente y tiene inserciones antideslizantes. Este inodoro American Standard en particular tiene obstrucciones cerca de los dos orificios para sujetar el asiento del inodoro, pero la rotaci\u00f3n disponible en la ranura me permiti\u00f3 usar un \u00e1ngulo diagonal (foto 2) para colocar el asiento a trav\u00e9s del bid\u00e9 con \u00e9xito. Las funciones de lavado delantero y trasero funcionan muy bien y permiten un buen control de la presi\u00f3n. El clic audible y t\u00e1ctil al llegar a la posici\u00f3n central de APAGADO tambi\u00e9n es una gran caracter\u00edstica. El paquete tambi\u00e9n contiene espaciadores altos que puedes colocar debajo del asiento del inodoro para levantarlo si toca el borde de la taza del inodoro, aunque no tuve que instalarlos. En general, estoy muy satisfecho con este producto.",

                "reviewTitle": "Great product, just watch the pressure! \ud83d\udca6",
                "reviewText": "**Update August 2023: Two and a half years later and I'm still very happy with this product. I still reccommend \ud83d\udc4c**Original ReviewAs of this review, I have been using this for three weeks. This is my first bidet purchase, and I installed it on an American Standard toilet with an elongated bowl, and slow close lid. My plumbing is standard for Canada.1\ufe0f\u20e3 InstallationThis quick and easy for me. I did not require any tools, and even though I didn't use the Teflon tape, I have not had any leaks. ( I will go back and apply the tape, I just wanted to test the setup). I did not need to use any of the bumpers provided for the toilet seat, either. Also, the instructions state that if the toilet isn't going to be used for a long period of time that the water source should turned off, I assume to prevent leaks if these parts fail; something to consider if you are not home for extended periods of time.\ud83d\udc49Ensuring that the rubber stoppers are in place, and in the correct position is key for ensuring there are no leaks!2\ufe0f\u20e3 Looks & CleaningIt is a different shade of white than my toilet. In my bathroom, the control handle sits closest to the wall and is generally protected from accidents (weight being applied, things dropped on it). Also, it does add more crevices for toilet gunk to hide; bathroom fuzzies and loose hairs that accumulate on toilets. Something to consider if you are planning on installing this is a high volume washroom.\ud83d\udc49If your bathroom has very tight spaces around the toilet, make sure you will have room for this.\ud83d\udc49If your exports look like chocolate bomb exploded in the bowl where the bidet will be sitting, consider how much extra cleaning this will involve and if your household members will actually keep this up.3\ufe0f\u20e3 The SprayI read a review about bidets before that mentioned \"blowing your anus right off\" and damn, if that isn't the truth! I find you have to wait a second after turning the dial for water pressure to build up enough to open the nozzle. For example, if the pressure was 1 to 5; turn it to 1 until water starts coming out, and then to your desired setting. In one of my attached photos, I've drawn red lines to indicate the max that I've gone to. I am in Canada, it is winter, and I've hooked into the cold water toilet line. A quick blast from the bidet isn't too bad, but if you dial up too much, or for too long, it is basically like waterboarding your orfices with ice water, and you may leave the washroom feeling violated.This bidet has a bum wash and a femine wash. The nozzles are in the same spot, but just seem to have a different spray setting. If we're comparing to garden hoses, think 'full' for bums, and 'jet' for the femine wash (Yikes). The angle is just slightly different, but I find myself trying to shuffle around to make sure my bits get a rinse which sometimes leads to water somehow spraying back onto the seat and lid. This could be because I usually perch closer to the end away from the tank. I can assume that if a male hit the 'feminine wash' by mistake, that you might hear crying coming from the washroom.Probably the most important bit of information in here is that this bidet has been surprisingly effective at rinsing away all exports. I just use a small wash cloth to dry off any whizzels, keeping g a lot of toilet paper from entering my septic system. As for deuces, I still use a bit of toilet paper, but I have yet to see any evidence of exports on the TP even if I had consumed an expired family size bagged salad kit the day before.\ud83d\udc49When you dialing the spray, WAIT a second for the water pressure to build enough to open the nozzle, THEN dial up the pressure!\ud83d\udc49The 'feminine wash' is um...aggressive. Consider making a simple instruction/warning sign for house guests in case they are brave enough to try it out.\ud83d\udc49This bidet is effective at rinsing away exports. I'm saving on TP, and giving my septic system a break. A pack of baby wash clothes from the dollar store work great for drying off the pieces.4\ufe0f\u20e3 Final VerdictI am happy I bought this, and would buy again. I don't see myself buying anything fancier than this in the future because this one is doing what I need it to; clean my pieces, and reduce TP consumption. As a female, I am glad I have the option for femine wash.Hope this review helps!",
