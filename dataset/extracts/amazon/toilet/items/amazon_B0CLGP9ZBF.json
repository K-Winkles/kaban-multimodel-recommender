                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fits just right",
                "reviewText": "I ordered a bidet that came with a T-adapter, but the included T had improper threads and did not screw onto the toilet. This T-adapter worked as a perfect replacement and screwed onto the toilet and water hose easily. I like that it comes with several gaskets to fit different applications, teflon tape, and and adapter to fit two different sizes of bidet hose. It feels well built, and the shut-off valve moves very smoothly. It can be partially closed to reduce flow through the bidet as well. Quality product.",
