I wasn't sure if I wanted one with temp control, but I saw this one on sale and figured I'd try it out without because the price is great. I am so glad I did! This thing works great and I don't really feel like I need the temp control (even though I live in Idaho and it's freezing in winter lol. It's fine!) Anyway, it was also insanely easy to install. I just watched a YouTube video of someone else doing it and I had it on and working in less than 20 minutes and no leaks or problems and barely having looked at the instructions. I would highly suggest this. I bought two for both bathrooms because the price was so good. Definitely a handy gadget. Makes things more sanitary especially when you have female needs.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a bidet for my old apartment more than 5 years ago, then proceeded to buy one for my boyfriend's apt, and one each for my sisters as gifts. When my bf (now husband) and I moved in together 3 years ago we brought the bidets- as once you experience a clean bottom after using the loo, you cannot go back to life without one attached to your toilet.Fast forward to the present: we needed new bidets due to the vigorous beating/cleaning my husband gives them when he scrubs down the bathrooms bi-monthly (he broke one nozzle door clean off and set the other nozzle off-kilter, but I digress). I decided to go for a dual nozzle for the lady bits and after reading reviews and liking the buttons on this bidet as opposed to a dial, ordered a brushed nickel one.I love this bidet. The buttons are easy and wonderful. It's a great-looking bidet. It was easy to hook up. The price is a steal.Naturally, I had to order a second one for our second bathroom. This time I ordered it in black to match the hardware in the room and have absolutely no aesthetic complaints.An hour ago we bought one as a gift for friends who hosted us for the day and night at the beach yesterday. Not only because they were such fantastic hosts, but also because we wanted to gift them with cleaner nether regions and fewer toilet paper runs, too. Okay... the truth is that I owe them. Not only because we were talking up our bidets with a strange exuberance last night (as you do when intoxicated and stumbling upon 'interesting' conversations) but also because I ate all of their ice cream in the middle of the night (too much wine and a bad case of the munchies). So, not only did we have to prove our point about the bidet magic, I needed to send them something cool as an apology of sorts for plundering their freezer as well. I do believe I will be forgiven instantly upon its maiden use.Buy this one. You'll like it.",

                "reviewText": "Instructions are too simple, need a bit more detail on where provided plumber's tape is needed, how to be ready to mop up a little water, best direction to aim the t connection and how to adjust, how the round adapters work to match holes in existing toilets and how they snap in (helpful to know you have to do that, since the plastic is thin and I was afraid of breaking it). Otherwise, if you are OK installing shower heads and hoses, this is easy. It works very well, just make sure you are OK with the water temperature from your cold line. I am in my 60s, but I like doing stuff like this.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Samodra Bidet from Amazon, and I must say it has been a game-changer in terms of personal hygiene. The installation process was surprisingly straightforward, even for someone like me with limited plumbing skills.What truly sets the Samodra Bidet apart is its remarkable performance. The precision of the water spray is customizable, providing a gentle yet effective cleansing experience. The nozzle self-cleaning feature is a fantastic touch, ensuring a hygienic operation every time.After a romantic dinner, I decided to put the Samodra Bidet to the test. The refreshing sensation and thorough cleaning left me feeling exceptionally clean and invigorated. The water temperature control feature is a luxury, adding a touch of comfort to the experience. After a few glasses of White Zinfandel and several bowls of chili, I was feeling particularly adventurous and I decided to try the \u201cfemale\u201d front nozzle setting. It was incredible! I felt it wash away all my pent-up rage and aggression along with the feces and I was left feeling clean and calm. I have been using it daily now and could not feel better or more in control. I seem to be constantly backing my car into things, and I cry uncontrollably at TV commercials, but I honestly have never felt more in tune with the World.The adjustable pressure and nozzle positions cater to personal preferences, making it suitable for users of all ages. It can also be dialed up to a shocking stream that feels like there is a tiny Fire Fighter in the toilet putting out a five-alarm blaze in my balloon knot. The sleek design and intuitive controls enhance the overall user experience. Moreover, the bidet's energy-efficient mode aligns with modern sustainability values.In conclusion, the Samodra Bidet exceeded my expectations, providing a level of cleanliness and freshness that traditional methods simply cannot match. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade their bathroom experience with a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly bidet.",
