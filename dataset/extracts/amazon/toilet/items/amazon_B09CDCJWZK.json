                "reviewText": "My contractor made a mistake in locating the sewer line of the toilet and we didn't catch it until after the porcelain tiles on the floors and the walls were installed. Then we realized that a standard 12\" rough-in toilet wouldn't fit in there and I had to find a 10\" rough-in. I ordered this beautiful toilet and the seller mistakenly sent me a 12\" rough-in first. When I reached out to them, they were very apologetic. They let me keep the 12\" toilet and they sent me a new 10\" one which arrived in a few days. I was very pleased with the customer service and the quick shipment of the correct size toilet.From the comfort standpoint, the toilet seat is a bit smaller than the toilet itself and it is raised almost half an inch which makes it a bit uncomfortable to sit on. I am planning to change the seat cover to a slightly bigger toilet seat and a more flat one to make it more comfortable. Overall, I am very happy with the toilet, the look of it and my experience with the seller.",

The only problem I had was the toilet seat holders. The little gadgets used to hold the seat in place weren't holding it in place to the extent that it came undone. I emailed the company and they sent replacement holders. It took a few emails back and forth, but finally got it done. That said, it is a nice toilet, they just need to figure out a better way to hold the seat!Update: The company reached out to me several times after. I explained that even with new fittings, the seat still slid around. They've offered me a new seat that's better than the old one. I will update after I receive it. I've given 5 stars because of their outstanding customer service which I've not experienced with any other company.",

                "reviewText": "We purchased two of these toilets to replace 60+-year-old \"water hogs\" in a residence. Our experience so far has been positive. They are nicely designed and work as well as or better than similar products on the market. (i.e., no need to flush 14 times or whatever the heck the U.S. president claimed is the case with modern toilets!) The compact size has been a huge improvement in the smallest bathroom, and the toilet looks nice in the other one, as well. Installation was done by family members who have had experience with this particular home improvement project. Getting the seat installation right took some time -- each toilet had a slightly different seat attachment configuration, and the pictured instructions were a bit difficult to interpret.Possible Concerns: If you like an extended bowl toilet, or a higher seat, measure what you have and compare it to the specs on this before ordering. The compact size works for us but might not for others. The seat lids, like those on similar toilets on the market, do not feel as sturdy as wood or composite lids of the past, and given the unusual shape and attachment design, I don't know how easy they would be to replace, if necessary. Professional plumbers might have reservations about the flush mechanism, in case it is not easily repairable, or in case it is not made with standard components, but we haven't had any problems.",
