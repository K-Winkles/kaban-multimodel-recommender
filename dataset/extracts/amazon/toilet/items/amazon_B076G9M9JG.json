The installation was a breeze, and the quality of the product is impressive.The spray power is just right, providing a refreshing and thorough cleaning experience. I appreciate the simplicity of the design, making it easy to use for everyone in the family. The build is sturdy and feels durable, ensuring long-term reliability.My only wish is that it had a temperature control option. It's already fantastic, but being able to adjust the water temperature would take the experience to the next level, especially during those chilly mornings.Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase, and the bidet sprayer has become an essential part of our daily routine. If you're looking to upgrade your bathroom hygiene game, this is definitely worth considering!",

This saved me from having to use that peri bottle. Wait I actually did use it for a day or two before installing this. The bottle was too much of a thing. This is the way to go i reccomend this to any lady. It was easy to install. Though after 9 months the part that hold the hose is getting a bit rusty from the condensation of the tank. But I can take steel wool to it. Remembering to shut the valve off at first took some getting used to but because Im fearful of a leak and water all over the floor I've made it a point to shut off the valve. It stury feeling and not cheaply made. I used it to blast away spit up and food from my baby's clothes,since the tub is right next to the toilet.",
