This valve goes right onto the toilet water valve stem, just hand tighten. Then the hose from the wall valve screws into it and your bidet inlet hose screws into the 1/2\" or 3/8\" out. The reducer is included and so is a nice screen filter to prevent your bidet from getting clogged. This is a high quality valve with a high quality finish and super smooth operation. If you're installing a bidet, get one! In the pic, the on/off lever is facing rear so you can't see it.",

                "reviewText": "I dreaded having to install this because my past experience with cheaper adapters has been that you connect everything together, turn on the shut off valve and water sprays all over the place. So you turn off the valve and start tightening things. Turn on the valve and again, water sprays everywhere. Then you think \"maybe I overtightened something\" This can go on for a frustratingly long time and there are three places for the leak to be.With this adapter, I connected everything, tightened to what seemed right, turned on the valve and hey presto it worked first time. No leaks! Almost couldn't believe it. What usually takes forever took a few minutes. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I had high hopes that this would be an easy install for someone with minimal plumbing experience, but alas I had a few issues with leaks, and ultimately had to ask my more construction experienced husband to troubleshoot for me. One of the issues was that the cone shaped rubber gasket/washer that sits in the top female valve thingie wasn't seated inside correctly, and he ended up swapping it out for one of the flat rubber gaskets that came with the original t adaptor that came with our bidet. My husband was able to install it without leaks thankfully, and then it worked really well to adjust the water pressure to our bidet to a comfortable level instead of full blast.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the YHUX Bidet T adapter because it had a shut off, which allows you to shut off water to the Bidet (in case there is a problem/leak) while continuing to allow water to flow to the toilet.The YHUX Brass Bidet T adapter is quite heavy, has a nice chrome plating and comes with a 1/2\" to 3/8\" adapter which allows it to work on numerous bidet products. It feels well made. Most of the washers are included. I say most because if you look the second picture I've attached of the supply line, it comes with a cone washer...the YHUX valve does not, so be careful when you remove the supply line from the toilet fill valve not to damage the cone washer as you will need it to connect to the bottom of the YHUX... and you may want to separately purchase another one to use vs the flat washer that YHUX supplies...my personal feeling is that the cone washer is less prone to leaking.My toilet has a fluidmaster 400 toilet fill valve...and no matter how hard I tried, I could not get the YHUX to thread up tightly onto the fill valve. I had a new, spare fluidmaster v and tried mating the YHUX to it...perfect fit. So, needless to say, I replaced the valve already installed in the toilet with a new valve....which was seven years old and may have been nearing the end of its life anyway.I did not use teflon tape when connecting the YHUX to the fluidmaster, but I did use teflon tape to for the water supply line connection to the YHUX, for the 1/2\" to 3/8\" adapter connection and for the 3/8\" supply line to the bidet I chose....no leaks.Finally, and this is just an fyi, look at the picture of the YHUX connected to the toilet valve but before the bidet supply line was connected. You will note that in order for the bidet supply line connection to be facing forward, the shut off valve will be to the rear...making it hard to see....but it is easy to turn and does it's job perfectly.Would I buy this product again and do I recommend it....absolutely yes.",

                "reviewText": "After reading all the reviews, I got this valve to control the water pressure of the Luxe bidet. The Luxe bidet valve control is very disappointing and bad in design. Turning the knob clockwise starts increasing the water pressure a little and then it suddenly goes to max pressure, enough to cause serious injury. There is no gradual increase of pressure.I thought that this YUHX T valve would fully solve the problem. However, all this T valve does is limit the total pressure going into the bidet. It doesn\u2019t allow the Luxe valve to have a gradual increase in pressure over the full range of motion. After installing the YUHX T valve, the Luxe bidet pressure does the same thing as before, but doesn\u2019t go to full pressure because of the YUHX T valve. It\u2019s a compromise and I guess I have to live with it. The problem is not with the YUHX valve but is with the badly designed Luxe bidet controls. Prior to the Luxe I had an Astor CB1000 bidet that didn\u2019t have the pressure control problem. However, the Astor was cheaply made and simply failed after a few months of use.",
