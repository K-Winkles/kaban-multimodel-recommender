They are pretty thick though. I wish they were thinner but if you look at the details (and the questions, someone was nice enough to do a print) you will see that you pretty much get a 1/2 inch lift which is a lot. I was thinking about whether I could cut them down, but I actually am going to lift the mounting of the toilet set so I can keep these bumpers as it is easier to put a spacer under the seat than any other option since I can't get the original bumpers. They are very nice, just thick.",

                "reviewText": "They do the job, they lift the toilet seat up so the bidet doesn\u2019t get stuck. Easy to install. The wipes that come in the package to promote adhesion are some kind of very powerful smelling chemical. I had to turn the fan on in the bathroom and vent the room after using them. Definitely make sure the room is well ventilated. I also washed the stuff off my fingers right after using the wipe and had to dry my hands on my shirt, which left bleached stains on my shirt. My fault, I know, but I would have liked some kind of warning on what the wipes were and to keep them away from clothing.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased a Clear Rear Bidet Attachment for Toilet about 6 months ago and new that I would need something to support the toilet seat once it was in place. These have 2 different size bumpers for hardware. Use the bigger bumpers in the back of the toilet seat and the smaller ones to the front. I used all the hardware devices, placing the longer ones at the 3, 6, 7:30, and 10:30 positions. The round supports went in between the long ones. The seat has not broken yet :)",

These exist as a single level. SINGLE height. Too short for my needs actually. The adjustable part is a flat rubber end, or a slightly curved end. So, about 1/2 of a centimeter? Yeah, totally adjustable.OTHERWISE these are sturdy, and the adhesion stickers AND prep pad are really good. I used the pad and a spare sticker that they included. The main component however was useless to me. Not happy!",

                "reviewText": "I'd bought a bidet, which I love, but I discovered after I installed it (and discarded the bumpers as unnecessary) that I probably did need to raise the seat a bit. So I called the company and they sent me to get these.The adhesive is really strong. I definitely recommend that you balance them on the toilet, then drop the seat onto them, though. I put the first one on the seat, then realized that I missed the rim of the bowl and had to move it. It's actually stuck pretty well, even after having been moved twice. But do it right the first time. Learn from my mistakes.I'm pleased with the quality, the packaging (minimal), and the way they work. I'll definitely buy this set again when I move and need to reinstall the bidet.",
