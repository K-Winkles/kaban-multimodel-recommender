                "reviewText": "The toilet was very well packaged, protected by thick styrofoam. I like that it is one solid piece, and the sides are flat, which makes for easy cleaning. I am not a plumber, and the instructions assume that you are an experienced plumber as they don't give any sort of measurements. I wasn't aware until I actually removed my old toilet, that the new one doesn't mount like a traditional toilet. The discharge on the new toilet is located further up from where it mounts. You will have to drill a couple holes through the floor in order to place anchors that are going to hold the toilet in place. The small holes on the sides are where the two mounting screws are inserted that will screw into the brackets that are anchored to the floor. If it were up to me, I would have provided some sort of diagram that could be laid out on the floor showing exactly where to drill the holes. In my situation, the plumbing coming out of the wall sticks out too far to allow for the toilet to be mounted where it needs to be. Be sure that will not be an issue for you or be prepared to hire someone to fix.",

                "reviewText": "As toilets give out in our house, I have been replacing them with dual flush, chair height models. The dual flush saves water and, after having four knee surgeries, the higher seat is a must for me. The Givingtree toilet is a sleek, stylish replacement option that have great features.First, the toilet is HEAVY. I normally can do installation by myself but I had to have my son help me with this one, especially carrying it up to the second floor! You are not going to be able to install this one alone. Installation was relatively simple for us but I have also replaced a good number of bowls in my life. There are instructions included but, if you aren't experienced, it may be best to hire a plumber.The best feature about the Givingtree toilet is that the base is a single, solid surface on the outside. Let's face it, cleaning a standard toilet can be annoying trying to get the dust and dirt from around the screws and pipe shapes on the base. The surface on this one is smooth all the way around and the glossy finish wipes clean quickly and easily. The dual flush option will allow you to only use the amount of water necessary to flush so it is definitely going to save you money and the powerful flush will use even less vs. my old, slower flushing toilet.There is a plastic seat included, which I am not a fan of, but it's easily replaced down the road. It is a soft close lid so you aren't accidentally going to make a lot of noise when using it in the middle of the night. It is also equipped with easy release hinges so you can clean underneath easily as well.All in all, this is a very nice toilet. While it is a bit more than a standard dual flush toilet that you get at a hardware store, it is much sleeker, water saving and is very easy to clean.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Being 6'1' tall I was tired of slouching down when using the toilet. So I decided to buy this one piece toilet which allows me to seat upright when going. The toilet took sometime for me to install .So give yourself an hour for the project. You'll have to drill two mounting screws in as well. I thought this would be hard but I just had to figure out where to place them and drill them in. The two has two flush settings so I can save on water when flushing number 1. Can't wait to make this my daily habit. What a sleek design to seat on my behind lol. Also, make sure not to drop you drill bit into the plumbing. I hope this will not effect me in the end.Video Update: I also wanted to share how the dual flush works. The center circle is spilt into to parts the small section light blue under the cover is for when you go number 1 and the large section white is for number 2 which will use more water. After each flush the toilet refills quickly and quietly. Great for when I have to go late at night and I don't want to disturb anyone else in the household.Even better the toilet seat itself has an easy clipping function that allows the removal of the toilet seat to clean the top of the area and to place back on. This makes cleaning a breeze!",

                "reviewText": "I'm not a plumber and this is the first time I installed a toilet. There's youtube videos out there and it looks simple. This toilet is a different set up. It doesn't bolt down to the drain pipe like the usual toilets. You'll have to drill 2x different holes and that's how this stays in place. The hole you need is pretty deep too because the bolts that came with these are meant for concrete floor per the instruction. It took awhile to install this because of all those issues.But after installation, this is a very nice toilet. comes with a soft close toilet seat and cover and easy to remove for cleaning. One advise is to make sure you use plumber/teflon tape when connecting the pipes. It's very hard to get access at the back, so make sure it wont leak before you put this into place.",
