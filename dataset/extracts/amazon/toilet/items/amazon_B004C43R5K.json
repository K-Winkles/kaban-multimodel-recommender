                "reviewText": "I picked up Toilet: Public Restrooms and the Politics of Sharing as a reference book for a talk I was giving. I thought I would skim through it for some examples of gender-free restrooms, and found it a fascinating history about Victorian norms, Utopian ideals, and how things like gender, sexual orientation, health concerns, and other hot-button topics have affected architecture and how we think about bodily functions. Very highly recommended, as it's easily understood and very well-researched. You may not think that bathrooms are an interesting subject, but give it a try!",
