I watched their installation video, followed their instructions and it works perfectly ! I am very happy with the look, the controls feel substantial, and the pressure is just enough....I am a woman and am glad it has both Bottom and Feminine nozzles. Time will tell if it holds up as well as my others have. The hardest part of this installation was my toilet seat ! Not the bidet, but all is well, and I can't wait to surprise my husband with it installed tonight !",

                "reviewText": "Follow-up Review:First of all, I encountered a small problem with the functioning of the seat (fixed easily), but I want to remark that, when I called the company at the number listed in the bidet manual, my call was answer within a few minutes. The agent was extremely helpful, and made some suggestions which helped me solve the problem. The agent also suggested getting some \"bumpers\" (available for about $9) at attach to the toilet seat in order to change the amount of pressure on the bidet apparatus when someone sits on the toilet seat. His suggestions were very helpful in resolving the issue in the short term, and I am convinced that the bumpers will solve the problem permanently.As to the problem solved:After more than a year of use, the product is working great, except that I did run into a little problem. The bidet is designed to fit some different configurations of toilet seats and toilets - installation is adjustable, to a certain extent. As a result, over time the toilet seat can move in relationship to the positioning of the bidet. If the toilet seat gets too far forward of the bidet, it can act to reduce the water pressure going to the bidet heads, precluding them from descending below the front cover of the bidet, and effectively no longer functioning. That happened today. I was able to \"repair\" the problem by loosening the nut that attaches the toilet seat to the toilet bowl, pushing the seat back towards the toilet tank, and then retightening the nuts. The Bidet now works as it should.Part of this problem was cause by the fact that our toilet set is a form-fitted plastic, rather than a less expensive wood seat. The plastic tends to bend a bit, as it is much less thick than the wood. (We have the same bidet on another toilet with a wood seat, and we have not encountered this problem before.)In order to deal with this difference in the toilet seat construction, the agent suggested the installation of some bumpers obtainable from the manufacturer for about $9. I have ordered the bumpers, and they should arrive in 2 - 5 business days. In the meantime, I'm certain I can keep the bidet working properly, even if I have to readjust the seat again. That is an easy process, as it requires only slight loosening of the nuts on the bolts attaching the seat to the toilet, moving the seat back towards the tank, and then retightening them. (Sorry if I'm repeating myself, but I don't want to spend any more time editing this review.)So, 5 stars for the bidet and 5 stars for customer support.Original Review:After installing the bidet in a secondary bathroom and using it for the first time, I immediately ordered another one for the master bathroom. I anticipate that a month's supply of toilet paper will turn into a year's supply - probably even longer. Retractable spray-nozzles aimed at just the right place, front or rear selectable nozzles, with a self-cleaning option on the spray-select dial.Installation was relatively easy - but then, I've replaced the mechanisms in toilet bowls several times, so working with that kind of equipment is not unknown territory for me. A couple suggestions:See if the water line from the water supply faucet to the toilet tank is flexible. If it's not, you will need to replace it with a flexible line. (Note: I had to replace my water line, a stiff metal pipe of about 8 inches length. I replaced it with a 20 inch flexible pipe, because shorter flexible pipes weren't quite flexible enough - a 12 inch pipe could not be made to bend to fit the space without putting a lot of pressure of the supply line coming out of the wall, and I didn't want to cause a leak inside my wall. The 16 inch was almost flexible enough, but not quite. With the 20 inch, I could loop the pipe around and up, and gain a lot of adjustment room.)Make sure you have a large screwdriver or some other tool which will enable you to loosen the bolts holding the toilet seat to the toilet, as you will need to remove the seat and the bolts in order to install the bidet attachment.Next, make sure you have the wrench(es) and a set of pliers that fit any nuts on the water supply to the toilet, as you will need to at least remove the supply line connector at the toilet tank. The bidet attachment kit comes with two plastic wrenches. Neither one fit any of the nuts on my toilet.This connector is usually held in place by a plastic nut with flanges so it can be tightened by hand. Loosening it by hand may be a lot more of a problem, hence the need for some tool (like big pliers) which can break the seal on the connector nut and get it started. Once that seal is broken, you should be able to screw the nut back on with your hands, giving it one last 1/4 turn with you pliers.Use the white Teflon tape that comes with the bidet to help seal the water connections. Just one turn around the threads of the connections is enough. Teflon tape is worse than plastic wrap for getting bound up in itself. I keep some on hand for various projects. It's easy to get an any hardware store. Look up a video on it on YouTube if your not sure how to do it. It's not hard to do, but if you're like me, you end up wasting a lot, because it gets bound to itself in a tight little rope that's hard to un-bind.As an add-on, Luxe sells a T-Valve connect which has a shut-off for the Bidet water supply. The T-valve that comes with the kit works find, it just doesn't have a shut-off. It's possible that such shut-offs can be purchased at hardware stores or Lowes or Home Depot, but I don't know. It's just one more convenience - if for some reason the bidet attachment start leaking, you have to shut off the water supply to the toilet as well. The T-Valve shut-off should enable the water supply to the toilet to continue unimpeded.When installing, have a small bucket or a towel handy, as there will be a small amount of water that escapes when removing the water supply to the toilet. In that regard, remember to always turn off the water to the toilet at the supply faucet and then to flush the toilet before doing any work on it.",

                "reviewText": "I never posted a review when I bought this. I honestly had no idea how I'd like it.Especially when it really wasn't that expensive against other products.People warned me that I wouldn't like cold water spraying me in the winter and that cheap ones don't work well.I really never believe 5 start ratings. Especially when people say they just purchased the item.Here's the real truth. The physical installation was simple. I wasn't crazy about my old toilet seat so also ordered the matching toilet seat. I like the soft closing feature on the new toilet seat.The bidet does a great job and the water pressure is fully adjustable.I use to use a lot of toilet paper and now I don't.I've tried to get my wife to use the female position. I'm not sure if she actually ever tried it but said she doesn't want to use it, nor does she like the plastic toilet seat. I bought one for her toilet as well and she doesn't want it. I never installed or returned it.For the install you have to close the water valve under the toilet. Well, mine wouldn't completely shut off. The old valve would still let some water through. I decided it was time to also change the valve. It was soldered on the pipe so I had to go buy a pipe cutter. To do this I had to turn off the water main for the house. That was also not turning off 100% and I decided I wasn't going to break that fitting to replace the main valve. I was going to turn my water off at the street so I began to go on a wild goose chase to find the right pole to turn off that special valve. I was told I needed a special pole that isn't sold at box stores. I ran around to multiple plumbing supply houses until I found one. It wasn't cheap. I later (after all this was done) saw it at Home Depot for 1/3 what I paid.So now I have purchased all these tools and a new shut off valve for my toilet. I shut off all the water to the house from the street and cut off the valve. I don't have enough pipe left sticking out the wall to put the new valve on. I know how to properly do it because years ago I had borrowed a neighbors pipe cutter, was able to turn off the house water, and easily replace her toilet valve.Now I need to keep the house water off and find a plumber. I don't know how to solder a fitting on a pipe. I had to hire a plumber who can come ASAP and pay for a different valve that is the kind you solder on. In the end I had spent several $100.I still recommend this Bidet. If your toilet valve turns off the water the installation was very easy to do in about 30 minutes. I also like it's matching toilet seat. Depending in the location of your toilet seats feet you may not be able to close the seat over the bidet. I wasn't crazy over my seat so just went ahead and ordered theirs. Like I said earlier, I like the plastic as it's easier to keep clean then the old wood one. I really like the soft self close. I've accidentally let other toilet seats slam because I'm now use to mine.",

                "reviewText": "This product has been my first and only experience with a bidet. As such I can not compare it to other products, but I can say that based on this product alone I sincerely wish I had them decades sooner. It's a weird subject to get into the details of, but for the sake of a review lets just say that it works and it works sooo well. The water is a very pleasing experience (not as cold or jolting as you might expect), leaves absolutely no mess behind even on the absolute worst of trips, and has greatly improved/reduced the hemorrhoid situation I've been dealing with. I've seen people say that after using a bidet they have started to hate using toilets that lack them - I understand this now. You will start to recommend bidets to your friends just as I am here recommending this to strangers.Installation was super easy. It took me about 25~ minutes to install, and that includes time spent watching a video tutorial while also trying to figure out how to remove my toilet seat for the first time. This product does come with plumber's tape, so if you need to use some you will not be required to make an additional purchase (I decided not to use any). The included wrenches were a big help for getting a nice tight fit on every connection - it has been several weeks and I still have not noticed any leaking. I DID have to purchase some additional spacers to lift my toilet seat in order to compensate for this device, but that is something that might ultimately depend on the toilet/seat (if you're not sure whether or not you'll need them, my recommendation is just to order some along with this product so that you'll have them just in case).I was a little worried about how flimsy the plastic 'arm' feels, given that we have a 4 year old in the house who might inadvertently press down on the whole thing, but so far there as been no issues regarding its durability.I am a male so I am unqualified to comment on the \"Feminine Wash\" setting that this particular model includes, but I figured it would be nice to have in case someone needs it.",

Regres\u00e9 nuevamente a este bidet sencillo pero efectivo. Super recomiendo.Rese\u00f1a original: Para instalarlo abajo de la caja del ba\u00f1o, trae una T de 7/8\", el est\u00e1ndar de M\u00e9xico, pero si por casualidad tu ba\u00f1o es de 1/2\" no te servir\u00e1, fijate cu\u00e1l tienes, es f\u00e1cil de revisar cierras la llave y retiras la manguera de ambos extremos, si notas que una es m\u00e1s grande que otra en cada extremo entonces tienes el est\u00e1ndar (abajo de la caja es 7/8\" o sea mas grande y el que va a la llave de paso es 1/2\" o sea m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o), si al comparar ambos extremos son iguales es que tienes de 1/2\" probablemente y no te servir\u00e1.Me gust\u00f3 mucho, casi no doy 5 estrellas en mis rese\u00f1as pero este producto lo vale, es indispensable para cualquiera, solo que muchos no se animan, yo me anim\u00e9 porque el papel ya es muy caro, realmente se instal\u00f3 super f\u00e1cil y no he tenido problemas no gotea ni nada. El \u00fanico detalle es que eleva un poco tu siento y no trae esas gomas que ayuden a tu asiento a nivelarse por la elevaci\u00f3n del producto, no es mucho como un cent\u00edmetro pero por el momento lo uso sin los niveladores y no he tenido problemas.El producto es genial, no depende de la fuerza del agua ya que tengo poca presi\u00f3n y funciona muy bien, cabe se\u00f1alar que solo sirve para agua a temperatura ambiente, no calienta ni te seca, solo avienta un chorro de agua a tu zona y limpia bien, sin rozaduras ni nada, para secarte puedes usar una toalla o el mismo papel pero en menor proporci\u00f3n que normalmente usar\u00edas, solo para secarte.El producto incluye todo para su instalaci\u00f3n hasta herramientas como llave y aislante, una vez instalado trae dos perillas, una controla la modalidad y son 3 opciones: la normal, para mujer y autolimpieza, la primera solo arroja agua, la segunda arroja agua un poco m\u00e1s adelante y la tercera limpia internamente las salidas de agua sin mojarte en caso de que estuviera sucio, recomiendo siempre usar esta opci\u00f3n antes de cada uso.La segunda perilla es para regular la presi\u00f3n del agua aunque la verdad en mi caso desde el nivel 1 hasta el m\u00e1ximo no siento la diferencia, ser\u00e1 que tengo poca presi\u00f3n pero es suficiente para limpiarte, de hecho si no hay nadie sentado el chorro de agua sale por varios metros as\u00ed que considero que funciona muy bien a pesar de la poca presi\u00f3n.Espero que mi rese\u00f1a te sea \u00fatil y te animes por un producto as\u00ed en caso de que tengas dudas, es muy f\u00e1cil instalarlo la verdad no lo cambiar\u00eda por nada.",
