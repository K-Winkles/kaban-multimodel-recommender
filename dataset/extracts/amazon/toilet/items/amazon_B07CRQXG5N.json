                "reviewText": "I don't know where to start with this purchase. All i can say it's the best purchase i ever made! I wished i had purchased this 25 years ago when i started having issues with wiping. I suffered nonstop from a medical condition(s), chronic hemorrhoids, scars, rashes, 2 colonoscopy's, and multiple issues down in that rear dark region. Almost daily I was in agony and constantly late for work due to wiping issues, and would schedule everything around wiping the b-spot. That was 2 decades of agony. Then came the pandemic 2020 and ordered a bidet due to the TP shortage, but it never arrived due to mail issues and the shortage of bidets. Then in 2021 I had an accident that left me in agony and pain with my right arm and shoulder. I finally had shoulder surgery Jan 2022, and two weeks prior ordered this bidet, THEN one week before installed it! Real easy to install except that i had to replace my old stiff copper pipe with a 12\" flex pipe, but that was one easy trip to the hardware store. No problem, no leaks, no issues, works perfect! Love the left nozzle since my right shoulder surgery, it's been a huge blessing! I can't speak words good enough for all the benefits this bidet has brought...it's refreshing, clean, no more mess, no chronic issues, and when I have a flare up it's easy and clean. I use 90% less TP, and look forward to \"me time\" on the throne. I feel like a King and cleaner than one too! We Love it so much ordered a second one for her too.",

                "reviewText": "This bidet was easier to install than I anticipated! Honestly the hardest of the whole project was figuring out how to shut off my water supply (which ended up with me calling maintenance because I couldn\u2019t figure it out). The instructional video was super helpful and I was able to install the bidet in less than 20 minutes with no leaks and ease of use. I will warn you though, the sprayer on this bidet is quite powerful and will definitely shock you at first. I would definitely warn guests before they use it too (as I\u2019m writing this and cackling, I can hear my partner screaming bloody murder across the apartment and I feel bad for not warning him)! Overall, I would definitely recommend this bidet but wish there was a feature for a softer spray.",

                "reviewText": "This was super easy to install. The only tools I used were tools to remove my toilet seat. I hand tightened all the connections ( hoses ) only. I only used the provided Teflon tape for the T connector that goes on the bottom of the connector to the valve from the wall. I really don't think I needed to use it at all to be honest. I would say it took me a half hour in total to install. That's getting my tool bag out, removing the debris ( box and packaging ) and such. My tip to you, use YouTube as a great guide. The videos on YouTube may not all be this particular bidet. but they are a great guide. Everyone does not have the same toilet or toilet seat, so tools maybe different. The only tool I used was a 1/2\" box wrench for removal/install of my seat. No leaks at all after install.The bidet itself works fantastic! I was very impressed by how well it worked. I will be saving a small fortune in toilet paper now. My wife loves it , I do wish it had the front nozzle for cleaning a woman's Y area. The model I bought will only clean the brown bullseye, but it does a very good job. The water pressure is strong enough to get a good blast of water at it. Some people say it's too powerful, but you can control the amount of water pressure with the control knob. I bought the simple one, the Brondell South spa, with only one control knob.If you know how to use a screwdriver ( most seats use a big screwdriver for removal ), know how to follow step by step instructions ( again use YouTube ) then you too can install this to your toilet. Also, you will still need toilet paper to pat your bottom dry from the water. But only one good pat should do the trick. You will feel much cleaner now with this bidet than using just toilet paper. I would recommend getting a bidet in every one of your bathrooms if you have more than one in your home. Just keep in mind the distance between your toilet to wall or cabinet. You may need the controls on the left side, like I did cause of the sink cabinet in the way, or the right side.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the southpaw because I did not have enough room on the right side for the controls. Also, this adapted to a top mount toilet seat , no tightening bolts are available underneath the toilet. Once I added the bidet, I also need to get longer screws to attach both the bidet and the original toilet seat. Other than this, the installation was pretty easy. The water pressure is amazing and you really don\u2019t need to turn the dial very far to achieve a good spray of water! Very pleased!",
