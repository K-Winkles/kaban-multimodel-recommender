                "reviewText": "This is the best appliance I've ever used. I like it better than my refrigerator and my gas range/oven that cost more. When the pandemic hit and there was a shortage of TP, I explored options for a bidet but I knew I wanted a more substantial update of my bathroom. Working from home, I was using the toilet more frequently and it became a no-brainer to replace the toilet and sink. I researched my options and the Kohler Veil sink and Veil toilet rose to the top of the list for my small area. From the first day it was installed, the Veil was nothing short of miraculous with its sensor automation, perfect height, heated seat, bidet options, remote control, night light and minimalist design.When the Veil was installed, my house had smaller-diameter galvanized pipes. The plumbing needed to be updated but with the poor flow, the toilet's eco-flush option would not thoroughly clear the toilet. The Veil is designed for full-diameter, proper plumbing to provide a more powerful flush. After I updated the pipes, the flush was twice as loud and powerful, and even the eco option was always effective. I also noticed the Veil filling up faster after flushing with the proper plumbing, even with the sink or shower in operation. I mention these details to describe that the Veil has a very forceful flush, but if you have old plumbing you will not reap the benefits.Likewise, the Veil requires proper power. My house uses knob-and-tube electricity (mid-century) and the wiring was a mess when I first installed the Veil. When my kid used massage function of the bidet, with its strobing effect, I would notice the lights in the living room strobing in the same rhythm and my kid said the same was happening with the lights in the bathroom. I had the outlets and lights properly grounded and put on a different electrical line, and this solved the problem. Again, I noticed the Veil making louder noises when retracting the wand, for example. The Veil requires a lot of water and electricity in certain moments of use, and does not perform optimally if that water and electricity is inhibited by older plumbing or wiring. Having said that, the Veil was still far superior to any other toilet, even before I upgraded the plumbing and wiring.The only negative I can think of is the lack of support for leaning back while seated. One can recline on traditional toilets with a water tank that keeps the cover from bending backward. But the Veil has only hinges connected to a motor supporting the upright seat cover. I did not want to risk breaking the hinges or motor by leaning back against the seat cover. Instead, I installed a small shelf that extends 6\" from the wall and centered it above the Veil to keep the raised seat cover from going further back if I put my weight into reclining. I can now recline without worrying about breacking the hinges.If I could give the Veil more than 5 stars, I would.",
