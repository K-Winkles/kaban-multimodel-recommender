                "reviewText": "Love the look of this toilet. Very modern and can not beat the price.The bolts that were provided were too short and had to get longer ones (extra $6)With respect to the install its very easy but need someone's help.Also to lineup the opening at the bottom with the screws we used painters tape on the floor and the outside of the toilet so when yiu lift the toilet you can line them up and its a piece of cake.Keeo in mind to have enough side clearence (at least least 10 in.) so you can stick your hands from behind to tighten the bolts.Overall very easy just a little prep work and might need to buy lo ger bolts.",

But about four months after I had it professionally installed it began leaking from underneath the base. Hundreds of dollars, three plumbers visits, and two reinstalls later it was still leaking. The plumber finally flipped it over and the interior portion was all wet and had what appeared to be multiple areas that had been patched/repaired and one of them was leaking. So beware!",

                "reviewText": "As part of two bathroom renovations I did extensive research before selecting this toilet. I was so disappointed that the lid didn\u2019t properly fit on either. We called product support and they asked us to email. We emailed and never heard back. We ended up having the plumber shave down the bowl to fit the lid. Also, the half flush is on the left, full flush on the right. One of the toilets is correct but the buttons are reversed on the other lid so you have to press the big button for the small flush and vice versa. You can\u2019t flip the lid backwards, either. No support offered. Amazon offered us a discount, which we used to pay the plumber. We\u2019re still stuck with reversed buttons. One toilet, fine, but 2? So disappointed. Based on this and lack of support, would not recommend- this toilet is heavy and hard to return. We\u2019ve scheduled a return for one of them and the drivers won\u2019t carry it back down the stairs where they delivered it. I\u2019ve stayed home from work 3 times since I have to be here and it\u2019s still on my porch.",
