                "reviewText": "I was in the process of replacing my old toilet's seal when I discovered that the bolts that held the tank to the base had completely rusted and several parts were shot. Seemed pointless, since the toilet was over 40 years old, to try to get parts to repair it. I needed a toilet that was no more than 26\" tall and had to fit into a very small bathroom. This seemed ideal and it was. Installation is a snap and unlike other toilets you buy, this company includes all the parts you need including the wax ring. The only real issue is that it is extremely tricky to center the toilet onto the flange bolts since you cannot see what you are doing and even trickier to get your hand into the small holes to screw on the nuts. Othewise, there's really nothing to put together. The toilet comes securely packed, encased in a thick Styrofoam sarcophagus. The company clearly doesn't want to take any chances with breakage. I chose to use one of the better than wax gaskets instead of the wax, only because when you are trying to center and place the toilet on the flange by yourself, changes are about 1000% that you will miss the mark and ruin the wax ring and then have to start all over with a new wax seal. The toilet looks great, operates great, and is a great value. My biggest concern was that because of the large toilet base, it was going to hit my water supply. My water supply line is much closer to the toilet than it is in most regular size bathrooms. However, the design of the toilet allows for enough carve out space in the back for it to fit. Yes! So pleased!",

                "reviewText": "UPDATED 4 weeks of using. It looks great & fits perfectly in my half bath. It's comfortable. Seat height is awesome. Easy to clean.Pros: Easy to clean. Looks Good from the ground up, except the short water tank.Cons: Seat and Cover takes 30+ seconds to close. The flush buttons are not easy to get to. I recommend a much taller water tank not the short one, for both looks and easier button access. It weighs 110 lbs. Moving it to install, especially lifting it over bolts to install is not easy if not a lot of room to do so. The holes for your hands to reach through to tighten it down are too small. There's no way anyone could reach around the back against a wall to tighten the bolts. Small hands will work through the holes on the side, but why not make the holes large since plastic fillers are going into them anyway?Pros point two: I have a new toilet in a half bath downstairs, it looks good, it works.",

                "reviewText": "This is an excellent product and I can only echo the many previous enthusiastic purchasers. I did, however, encounter one very odd problem: the dual flush two-section button on the tank lid was installed incorrectly by the maker and was rotated 180 degrees from the correct position -- i.e. the smaller section triggered the large flush and the larger section triggered the smaller flush.I first tried unscrewing the plastic clamp on the underside to loosen the button and rotate it, but the clamp wouldn't budge. I finally finessed it by taking a wide-blade screwdriver and a small hammer and tapping carefully on one of the clamp's fins repeatedly, incrementally rotating the clamp and the button together until the correct position was achieved. Frankly, I would have just left it as delivered, but now the wife is happy, I don't have to listen to the complaints, and I am (ahem) flushed with success.",

                "reviewText": "This toilet exceeded my expectations in every way. First and foremost, installation was a breeze. The clear instructions and user-friendly design made the process hassle-free, even for someone like me who isn't particularly handy.What truly impressed me was the outstanding customer support. The team went above and beyond to ensure my satisfaction. They promptly checked in with me to make sure everything was in order and that I didn't encounter any issues. It's refreshing to see a company that genuinely cares about their customers' experience.The comfort chair seat is an absolute game-changer. It provides a comfortable and ergonomic seating experience, which is a welcome relief. The sleek and modern design of the toilet also adds a touch of elegance to my bathroom.However, there is one downside that has left me a bit disappointed. Unfortunately, my Squatty Potty does not fit around the front of this particular toilet. It had to be removed to accommodate the toilet. While this is a minor inconvenience for me, it's worth noting for those who use or plan to use a Squatty Potty regularly.I still highly recommend this toilet for its easy installation process, exceptional customer support, and overall comfort. It's a reliable and stylish option that will undoubtedly enhance any bathroom.",

His feedback was the holes in the side are too small and make it difficult to see to align the toilet onto the mounting bolts in the floor. The covers for these holes are cheap and flimsy and do not sit flush ( I have 2 of this style of toilet, different brand, in other bathrooms and the hole covers are flush) The extra parts that came up on Amazon as \u201c items you might need\u201d were the incorrect size- again I could not return as I had them too long. In a nutshell this toilet is a great example of you get what you pay for . Thankfully the. Plumber had agreed a fixed price for this install , or it would have cost me an absolute fortune, 4hrs it took him ! I would not buy this brand again.",
