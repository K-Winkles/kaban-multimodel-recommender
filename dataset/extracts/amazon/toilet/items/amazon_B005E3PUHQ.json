                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A Great Toilet But Shipping Was Horrible",
                "reviewText": "First of all, I have purchased and installed three of these in my home in the last month. They are stylish and replace the bulky looking toilets of the past. Also, my previous toilets used about 3.4 gallons of water per flush and this one uses at most 1.6 gallons per flush. You will get a short flush if you just push down the flush lever, but if you hold the lever down until all of the water flushes through and the drain exit rebounds with water, you will get the full flush. I think that the full flush is just as good as the old toilets that I replaced. I haven't noticed that I need to clean the new toilets anymore than the old ones. The installation was a breeze and I used wax-less toilet gaskets. Just remember to adjust the water level and make sure that the rubber fill tube is fully inserted.The first of the three toilets was ordered from Amazon. When the two boxes were delivered, the box for the bowl had a hole in the side of it. The hole appeared to be worn through as opposed to being punched through. The bowl was visible through the hole in the box and had been badly scratched. There did not appear to be an inner box surrounding the bowl - just the bowl in the box with corner reinforcements. I submitted a return request and took them to the local UPS office, which informed me that the return label could only be used with the damaged box and that the other box would have to be returned separately. They were nice enough at UPS to call Amazon for me (I did not know that you could call Amazon) and the Amazon representative told me that they would arrange for a separate delivery service to pick up the undamaged tank box. It appears that both boxes must be returned if only one of them gets damaged. This whole deal was a headache. It was made worse by the fact that Amazon would have shipped the toilet tank without it being contained in the Kohler shipping container which then should have been packed in a separate reinforced outer box. The replacement delivery of another tank and bowl had no problems and were packed as I would have expected.Because of this fiasco, I purchased the 2nd and the 3rd toilets directly from the Kohler website. The list prices were higher than on Amazon, but the website had a promo code which resulted in the same price as Amazon lists, including shipping.The first toilet that I received from Kohler had a tank lid that was fractured into three pieces in the shipping box. The tank and lid appeared to be very adequately protected in the box and the box showed no signs of mishandling. Kohler was very nice in immediately sending me a replacement lid and I didn't need to return the fractured one to them.The second toilet that I received from Kohler had no issues. However, I bought a Kohler toilet seat at Lowes and both of the hinges were completely broken in the box and I exchanged it for a new one which was fine. Again, the packaging for the broken toilet sheet showed no signs of mishandling.So, my experience with this product is that it is a good, stylish product which will save you a lot of water and it is easy to install. The biggest issue with this product is getting components that are not broken. Kohler seems to be a very good and very nice company, but they should review how the supply chain, starting in their manufacturing facility and extending to customer deliveries is handling their products. I absolutely WOULD NOT recommend buying this toilet from Amazon due to the fact that they attempted to send me the bowl of the first toilet improperly packaged not contained in a Kohler shipping box - it was just packaged bare inside of a big box with corner protectors and once that box got a hole in it, the bare bowl was exposed and damaged.",
