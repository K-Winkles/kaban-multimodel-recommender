The Bemis name meant a lot when it comes to QUALITY.This seat fits right, is built right and the grab handles are 2\u201d further apart than the \u201c blowmolded\u201d junk you will find out there. Not to mention the ability to flip it up for cleaning. The installation couldn\u2019t have been easier, comes with everything you need. Yes , it costs more than the \u201cblowmolded\u201d junk, trust me, it is worth every penny. One last thing, it will actually safely support an adult!",

                "reviewText": "Would have given 4.5 stars instead of 4 if that were an option. Got this for my husband post knee replacement surgery. So easy for me to install. Only challenge was reaching under the seat with the provided tool. Very awkward and can\u2019t see but I managed. Solid, sturdy design. Fits our elongated toilet perfectly. Wish handles gave better support/ less wobbly when the seat is up for him standing to use toilet. Only had a little urine escape down the side of toilet once while seated. Could use a little longer splash guard in front but again, only happened once so far. Very pleased with the product. Cleans up easily as well. Highly recommend.",

It is completely stable, as it has multiple supports under the seat and the shield keeps the gap between seat and bowl covered, so cleaner than other types. I bought the optional arms and like that I can use just one, as her bathroom is small. It is a great height and lots of room between arms for easy on and off. Like that nothing touches the floor, so nothing to move when mopping. Highly recommend.",

The bolts were long and passed through 2 shafts to connect to the toilet tank. I did my research, checked the feedback for this product and looked at its design before I purchased it. The installation took less than 15 minutes and required a lot of turning to fasten the bolts in place which was slow because I had to bend down and look at the underside of the top of the bowl but I persevered. So far, we are happy with the purchase as the seat has not moved. There is a gap between the seat and bowl which will make it easier for cleaning the area between the two. Thank you to Bemis for making such a wonderful product. Don\u2019t waste your money on other raised toilet seats.",
