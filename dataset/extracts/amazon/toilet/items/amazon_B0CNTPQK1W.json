                "reviewText": "Love the elegant design and easy to use buttons. First bidet I've owned, and like many say, \"I can't believe I waited this long.\" Worth every dollar. Very sturdy and high quality. Water line and fittings are all metal. The pressure control works great and can be set to your pleasure and comfort, especially if you're new to water shooting up your bum. Thanks, KingGeorge",
