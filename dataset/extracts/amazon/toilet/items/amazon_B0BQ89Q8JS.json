                "reviewText": "I will have to admit to being pleasantly surprised by this Bio Bidet Slim Zero seat. At around $90 I wasn't expecting too much, but my 8 year old Luxe bidet had cracked badly, and if you've come to use a bidet, you don't want to be without one! I recently retired and $250 bidet seats were not in my budget, so this looked better than the $100 Kohler to me - less ... bulky.The seat at first looks ... well, kinda cheap. But as I started to install it, I saw just how well made it is. Of course most of the construction is plastic so it seems very light weight. The installation is a breeze - great instructions, components THAT FIT, and a logical design. The appearance of the opening looked very small to me, but that was compared to my original Delta toilet seat. When I did sit down, I was amazed at how comfortable and solid it felt!The front and rear positioned jets take a little adjusting of your posterior to get that great match, but after a while I felt like my old Luxe friend was back, but better - everything is one piece!The pressure is very adequate - I can't believe you can remove the restrictor to get MORE pressure!!! Space Launch!!!The removeable feature for cleaning is practical and appreciated - very easy.My only complaint is the position of the pressure handle. You get used to it just fine while seated, but when you're wiping down a toilet, it is very easy to jog the nozzle and spray water all over. I've learned to be careful while cleaning. One other mention of the handle; the middle position, or off, is not a very positive \"click\" type feeling, and sometimes it takes a little finagling to hit the center \"off\" position.Overall I am very satisfied with this Bio Bidet Slim Zero bidet seat. Keep the great products coming!!",

                "reviewText": "The Bemis Bio Bidet is a lot like the superlative American Standard bidet (elongated only, sadly) but with brass components. We don't care about the gimmicky nightlight, just the quality, and so far the Bemis is a keeper. We added a T-valve cut off. Otherwise, it was a by-the-book standard easy install. Be sure to hand tighten or barely tighten with channel locks. People seem determined to wrench away and overtighten all these bidet products, then are surprised when leaks sprout around the plastic fittings.Suggested but not required: Even after years and years of variant DIY home plumbing projects, I still use a thin strip of thread tape on most connections. Just peace of mind. I also wait 24 hours before declaring victory, putting down under the fitting(s) a hand towel and a couple of paper towels in order to absorb and see any potential leaks.",

                "reviewText": "This is our first experience with a bidet so I don\u2019t have anything to compare it to. It takes some getting used too, but seems to work well. I did a lot of research before purchasing because I didn\u2019t want to spend a ton of money, but didn\u2019t want a piece of crap either. I almost bought a version that wasn\u2019t a toilet seat, it just goes under your existing seat until I saw lots of people mention that those type don\u2019t work with certain toilet seats. That it raises the seat and leaves a big gap you need to use spacers to fill and then it looks stupid or angles weird. Since this one included the seat it fits nicely and no ugly gaps. It also has a brass fitting instead of the plastic many of them come with. As a first time bidet user I was a little concerned about the water temp since this is not heated at all, but it\u2019s been totally fine. Overall very happy with the purchase. As someone with ulcerative colitis I should have gotten a bidet a long time ago.",

                "reviewText": "First off, why haven't I gotten a bidet much sooner? So much cleaner to use than toilet paper!I was a bit worried about the water temperature since it is whatever the temp is in the water line, but quickly found out that's not much of an issue. It feels fine to me, perhaps if you live in a further northern climate where water temperatures are much cooler, then it could be of concern.The bad, the water control for turning the water on/off vs for the front/back is a bit finicky, if you don't get it back exactly to the mid position, it can continue dripping water until you notice it and specifically get it back to the exact mid position. There really should be a little wider range in the middle for the water to be off so that it does not drip and waste water. Also, if you have an elongated toilet seat, this kind of limits the elongated section a bit too. These are the only negatives I've noticed, but with water being fairly expensive in my area, a dripping bidet can add up to a significant water bill, so I'll probably replace with another bidet that has better on/off of the water control.Hmm, I bought this as a black friday deal in 2023 for $99, now after writing a review, I see it is now priced at $79, and 10% off. Here's your black friday deal, we'll up the price and list it for more and then put it back to normal later!",
