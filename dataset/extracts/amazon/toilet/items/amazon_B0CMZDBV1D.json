The one adapter they came up with has two check valves inside of it. The geniuses that assembled these adapters put the check valves in backwards. I bought two bidets and had to remove the internal lock ring and pull the check valves out. I discarded the cheap valves and assembled the unit without the valves.

                "reviewText": "Waterpark BeWell Bidet. On the install, everything was easy until I got to the T adapter. It came with a flat washer to attach to the flush valve instead of the industry standard cone washer. Couldn't get it to stop leaking! These fittings are supposed to be installed finger tight and not leak. After multiple install and uninstalls, (about an hour and lots of water on the floor) I finally twisted the fitting hard enough with a liberal coating of silicone grease on the washer. I was afraid that I would break the plastic flush valve with the stress required to get the fitting tight enough. I guess the manufacturer saved maybe 5 cents by using flat washer. I'll pick up the correct part next time I'm at a plumbing supply or I'll just return the item. If you don't recognize the terms I'm using in this review, you probably need to have a plumber do the install for you. He'll probably have the correct part on his truck. Update: I decided to return the item. The water control knob has 2 pressure stops. The first one just causes water to dribble out of the nozzle shield. The second stop shoots water out. I am guessing that it is probably the built-in backflow preventer, but not sure. I purchased a different brand, and it also had a flat washer for the fresh water connection. In anticipation of this, I purchased a cone washer: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H5SXU2?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1 Hooked everything up and no leaks.",
