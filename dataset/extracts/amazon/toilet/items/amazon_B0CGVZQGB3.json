                "reviewText": "This review is for the American Standard H2O ...dual flush 1.28/1.6 gpf (separate) toilet, I will try to update with model later especially if I got any of that wrong.Originally I wanted a Toto Drake but the design of the bowl has changed and according to the reviews and the photos, this seem to be the best choice for the price point as I have always felt Kohler to be overpriced. This toilet is in perfect shape with no visible defects in the ceramic and it seems to be thin but that can be from replacing a much older toilet. The tank is significantly smaller, more compact but not shorter as far as I can tell. I have two more i need and I will be looking at American STD (possibly this toilet) if Toto doesn\u2019t make a change soon!!! This was shipped as two, inside larger boxes with the foam, no complaints there whatsoever.I needed a dual flush option, because I have two boys using this bathroom. The buttons on top are easy enough for my eight-year-old but does require some ability to push the button all the way down probably two inches or so. The handicap height is great for me but their feet hang off again like they used to when younger.Everything went in well and as expected, I installed the toilet myself, the only thing that was missing was the supply nut - but I think that\u2019s standard for American Standard toilets that are separates. All in one boxed Am. STD toilets come with the supply nut but I never installed too many of this brand. All you need in addition is: a seat, toilet flange bolts, wax/preferred ring, supply line, and thread sealant of choice (if that\u2019s your preference, MEGALoc is mine). The supply line (with the nuts already attached) is fine and probably in everyone\u2019s best interest with the way the rubber is shaped at the tank side of the connection. It\u2019s better not to reuse unless you can or want to for the same reason, I suggest waiting for the toilet before making the trip to local hardware for the best measurement of the supply line.",

                "reviewText": "This was an easy purchase and free shipping as we have Prime. It comes in two boxes and is very securely packed. It does take two people to install at least if you want to make it easy on yourself. Be sure to buy a wax ring which you will need for installation as well as bolts to attach to the floor. These are not included. You can reuse the bolts from your old toilet if you'd like. That's what we did. Also be sure to buy a toilet seat which also is not included. Apparently, the tank should be installed such that it is flush against a wall. That did not work out for us. Once installed in the floor it is about 4 inches away from the wall. The tank needs to be against the wall I believe to be steady. I had no problem settling for hiding some foam packaging material between the tank in the wall. However this may not be to your liking. Although the mechanisms inside the tank look overwhelming, it is ready to go without any tweaking unless needed based on your water pressure. There was nothing we needed to do but there are detailed directions on how to alter the mechanisms to create a better flush. I am perfectly satisfied with this purchase.",
