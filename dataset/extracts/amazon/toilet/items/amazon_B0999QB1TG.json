Note that it does not come with a filler/cap for the optional washlet so you will have a visible hole near the top of the seat when the lid is closed. They sell a cap but when I checked it was like $20 for a plastic part that likely cost them Pennie\u2019s. That should really be included with the toilet.Other than that it\u2019s a great unit flush is powerful bowl stays clean. I may one day add the Washlet feature so it\u2019s nice to have a toilet that is made for that.",

I am very glad that I won't have to ever again buy an \"American Standard\" product; it's embarrassing how badly made their toilets are. I have suffered for decades with their \"contractor specials\" that I would have replaced in a moment had I known that Toto was available, or that Kohler had such superior products.Thank you, Toto!",
