TUSHY gets its water straight from your water source (the same water you brush your teeth with). You could totally drink from TUSHY, which would be weird, but hey, you do you! How does the water get hooked up to the TUSHY? It really is as easy as 1-2-3 before you number 2. Simply use the adapter provided in the box to connect the TUSHY to the water supply that fills your toilet tank. The included hose will connect the adapter to the TUSHY. Does TUSHY require electricity? Nooo way! TUSHY doesn\u2019t use any electricity, so it\u2019s even more carbon footprint friendly and accessible for everyone. How is it cleaner? Here's the clean deal: If you got poop on you, would you wipe it off with dry paper? No silly! You'd wash it off. So, why would you treat your butt any different? Not to be clich\u00e9 like a cheesy 90's infomercial but TUSHY removes all the fecal matter. Aren't wet wipes just as good as a bidet? Nope! Yes, in the current wiping climate, wipes of all kinds are easy to use and overly accessible. Yet what the wipe manufacturers don't want you to know is that chronic use leads to significant skin breakdown and increased sensitivity.",

                "reviewText": "It wasn't hard to install (I have a Kohler \"standard\" toilet with the flexible braided hose coming from the wall). You do get a good opportunity to clean the yuck where the screws attach, which was good.What I didn't understand, and the directions don't mention, is exactly how the sprayer works. If you first turn it on, it sprays downward into the bowl. Huh? So I loosened the screws and pulled the whole thing forward, thinking that somehow the nozzle was supposed to be able to turn upward and couldn't because of how I had installed it. But no. I tested it again, standing in front of the toilet. I turned the dial to get the spray going and turned it a little further, and got wet. There's a little part that descends from the nozzle when you get the pressure higher, and it has a little squirter that gets the water upward where it needs to go.If I ever find an electrician to install a GFI near the toilet, I'll spend the money on an upgrade that gives me warm water (the water from the main service is COLD where I live), but until then I'm happy.I'm a little too old to enjoy potty humor, but if you like it, they have lots of it.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars First bidet, I am horrified and delighted",
                "reviewText": "First, let me say that I could only realize the absolute squalor that I had been living in after my first use of this bidet. I always conceptually understood that a bidet would be an improvement, especially because I just simply wanted to feel fresher let alone the hygiene aspect And the aspect of feeling gross like your clothes are now dirty specifically underwear until you\u2019ve had a shower. I would always use like five wipes, until there was no residue left, in fact, I did that several hours before installation. Let me say that to see the color change in the water and find residuals after my first use was shocking and disgusting. Here I thought I had a clean bottomI am 29 years old, female, living alone. I was really really scared that I would flood my apartment, but I watched the official tush installation video and I also watched a third-party reviewer installation video. I had no problem taking the lid off of my toilet because luckily mine just had wide flathead plastic screws so I simply used a kitchen butter knife and did not use a screwdriver or wrench one time.I have never turned off a water supply in my life, so I was pretty scared about that as well. When I first turned it off, I could hear some residual faint whining noise, like as if it were barely trickling in water. My water supply would not turn any farther so I thought maybe this is just the way my pipes are, I don\u2019t wanna break anything. But in the third-party YouTube installation video,when he took the water tube off, only a few drops plopped out unlike mine, which was basically trickling water nonstopI actually got overwhelmed and decided you know what maybe I\u2019ll just put everything back in the box and return it and resign myself to a life of showering because I am just a woman living alone and maybe this is something that I need a boyfriend to install, even though I\u2019m single for the foreseeable future.I sat there with my self pity, and then realized you know what I already went through the trouble to unscrew everything, I might as well just try one more time. Lo and behold, after turning the water supply back on and back off, there was no more sound of water supply trickling. It was completely off, and I was able to remove the pipe with only a few drops plopping out just like the review. There was a fair amount of dripping afterward however, so I just went quickly and put a bowl underneath like the reviewer said to. It only filled my drippings bowl like 1/3 of the way full. I connected the tank to the connector back to the wall pipe, it was then time to attach the tushy pipe, and there was just a bit of water on a continuous trickle out of that tushy tube hole but once connecting the tushy pipe, there was no more leakage whatsoever.I was scared, but I turned the water supply back on after tightening each screwing point.There were no problems at all. I remember in one of the review videos it said do not over tighten. You can damage your plumbing. So I just used my hands not a wrench or anything and I tightened each fixation point until It wouldn\u2019t budge and then I backed off.I spent about an hour afterward saying to myself holy crap holy crap oh my God, and resisting the urge to text everybody I know to get one. I am really really glad that I spent extra for the one with the adjustable angle because it can get the top of your butt crack, your actual poo area and if you are a woman, that area as well. This is really really nice, I\u2019m completely single and not even dating, but it will be nice when I am in a relationship because you don\u2019t always want to just sprint to the bathroom and jump in the shower minutes after romance even though technically it is recommended to not only urinate, but shower your region in order to prevent UTI or other damp bacteria related issues. This way you can do a quick bathroom trip then cuddle in bed leisurely instead of cut snuggling short for a shower.I\u2019m particularly looking forward to using this after my long runs because after running 10 miles you don\u2019t always feel like standing around in the shower, especially now that my new apartment does not have a detachable shower head, and I usually have to do some sort of gymnastics in order to make the water hit where I want to hit and do a lot of hand motions as well. I only put the strength on half strength before it actually started to almost hurt, it is literally like a pressure washer on half strength. I felt a really good clean both in my female regions and in my nether regions. Too bad my ex-boyfriend dumped me because Lord he would go into my bathroom and come out leaving a stink, not even bothering to turn on the fan. I can\u2019t imagine how good his wiping habits were. On second thought, thank God he dumped me. \ud83d\ude02Really satisfied and let me tell you after my first use, I was horrified and delighted to see that residue actually had been removed from my bottom, whereas I thought I was walking around with a clean, spotless bottom because of my baby wipes.",

                "reviewText": "I've always been considering getting a bidet after my trip to Japan. This just works ok, the spray pattern never feels super concentrated so my entire under carriage gets wet, as well as parts under the seat. And even after blasting at full pressure and trying to get all angles for several seconds I still have a lot to clean up afterward. I feel like I'm using more toilet paper otherwise my fingers tear right through the wet paper.Installation wasn't too bad and I get having to have universal compatibility for everything, tiny bit loose in that regard.I'd say this works perfect for women who want to use it on their front area, just keep the dial at the lower and and it's a nice light dribble. After that the spray gets a wide pattern.I'm glad I got it on sale, I'll keep it installed and use it every now and then. I'm sure it'll really be useful if I ever get a stomach flu or particularly runny day to save myself from chafing too much.",

Now, having used it for a month, I must say I'm genuinely impressed!What I Loved:Installation: The installation process was a breeze. The instructions provided were clear and the whole process was straightforward. Even for someone who isn't a DIY enthusiast, this was easy-peasy!Packaging and Documentation: The packaging is thoughtfully designed and is aesthetically pleasing. The documentation provided was clear and informative, which is always a huge plus.Functionality: The bidet itself performs beautifully.Areas of Improvement:While most of the product is top-notch, I did find an issue with the markings on the product. The indicators that show the water pressure and the usage of each button started fading after only a month of use. I haven't used any harsh chemicals or abrasives on the surface, so this was a bit disappointing. Having clearer, more durable markings would make the user experience seamless.Conclusion:Overall, the TUSHY Classic 3.0 Bidet is a great product. Just a small tweak in the durability of the markings would make it perfect. I'd still recommend it for anyone looking to upgrade their bathroom experience.",
