                "reviewText": "We wanted a heated water Toto washlet, but unfortunately getting an outlet in the bathroom meant getting a city permit, HOA approval, electrician, and city inspection lol. And extension cords are meant to be temporary. Oh well, a dream for another house.So after days of research, we decided on a cold water model, and went with this Delta unit.This thing is packaged like a luxury product. Everything is neatly encased in foam wrap and plenty of molded filler to keep it safe in transit from drops and dings. The plastic bags for the components is also thick and sealed, so that gave me confidence that everything was brand new from the factory. I\u2019ve had products like clothing and hygiene products bought on Amazon that were clearly used. Gross. So off to a good start.Installation was super easy and 20 minutes. Just needed a flathead screwdriver to unscrew old seat, and a Phillips screwdriver to put the new one in. Plus a little cup to hold a few drips of water when connecting the water supply.The baseplate is really well done, it adjusts side to side and also front to back, to get the right fit of the lid to the toilet. At first, my install fell short, where the lid was not aligned to the bowl, but it\u2019s super easy to detach the seat from the base plate with a quick release button. I pulled the base plate all the way forward and the fit was aligned.It might be good for Delta to put a \u201cthis side up\u201d and arrows pointing to the tank on the baseplate, but figuring it out only added a couple of minutes, based on the easy to follow instructions. Also it\u2019s common sense to flush the toilet and turn off the water supply before starting, which I did, but we all have our moments where we might forget and hurry through. So that could be something else to add.I liked the looks of the polished metal fittings on the hose, and all the connectors were easy to attach and screw in by hand. There\u2019s a disposable plastic cap to keep the gaskets in the fittings, as well as a note in the instructions to doublecheck the rubber gaskets are in the connectors before screwing in. This prevents leaks and I appreciated the attention to detail on this important step.Overall I can tell there is a lot of thought by the engineers that has gone into this unit.Usage is solid. Water pressure is good in both back and front modes. The dial is easy to use and has a nice audible and tactile click when you return it to the off position. You get the same cleanliness as any washlet. The room temperature water is actually refreshing, so not that big of a deal to not have. Maybe those with ice cold water, it might be a much bigger deal in the winter.Overall, a huge upgrade from using regular toilet paper. The level of clean you get with a washlet is beyond anything you can get with paper, even using wet wipes.Someday we\u2019ll live the dream of having the heated dryer, air freshener, and heated seat, but for now this Delta unit is a solid choice with zero complaints.",

                "reviewText": "First I tried the $400+ Toto C5 with heated seat, butt sensors, pre-mist, lights, remote control, etc. It\u2019s truly amazing but belongs on a spaceship not in my on-suite bathroom. Too far out for me. And my wife said she would use the guest bathroom before she would sit on that thing. Sent that back and tried the $69 Delta Refresh. It looks almost normal and does exactly what I need and nothing else. The cold water doesn't bother me at all and now I don\u2019t have to get an electrician. (Warning - TMI ahead!) I have hemorrhoids that too often make clean up a challenge. Now I only use paper to dry off. It is a pleasure. The quality is great. Seat is sturdy and doesn\u2019t slip or slide. Fits elongated toilets perfectly. Easy to install. I would replace all my seats with this one if I didn\u2019t have mischievous young grandchildren. And you can\u2019t go wrong at this price.",

                "reviewText": "I'm writing this review because I believe that some of the negative reviews would unnecessarily deter some potential buyers. First, some of the criticisms are true: the construction is a bit flimsy, and the bolt-washer fitting does in fact look as if it could break easily. Also, the lid and seat do wiggle left to right as one handles them; however, there are four non-skid supports, so that it is very steady when sat upon.One criticism that is flat wrong is that there are no installation instructions. They are on the box. While the installation is extremely simple and obvious, there are a pair of plastic pieces that some people will need instructions to figure out how to place, so it is a good thing that the instructions are in fact available.Some also criticized the size, both overall and of the opening in the seat. In my case, I was replacing the seat on a quite ordinary American Standard (elongated) toilet, and the fit was almost perfect--it is no more than a quarter inch shorter than the one I replaced--not enough to cause any problem. As to the opening, the reviewer who called it a baby seat was greatly exaggerating. It is the same as what I replaced, and seems perfectly normal to me, something you can confirm by looking at the dimensions of many other brands and models.I have no issues with its comfort or finish. Wood would have been sturdier than plastic, but the former is more subject to discoloration and flaking issues, so I think I'm going to be more than OK with plastic.At the time I'm writing this, customers are giving this seat 4.6 out of 5 stars, and this was the highest rating I was able to find among compatible, competing seats (of any price); there were frightening complaints about every seat I looked at--and I looked at a lot; so, yes, it comes down to a least-of-many-evils choice. My point is this: compare all the alternatives you can find, and read the negative reviews with care, figuring out which \"evils\" you can most easily live with, and don't necessarily run off and buy a seat that one of the reviewers claims is better; when I checked out the supposedly preferable alternatives, they proved to have just as many flaws, and sometimes worse, than the seat being criticized.For now, I recommend this seat (I should note that I got the standard-close, not the slow-close, version--I can't comment on the latter, other than to observe that it looks like an unnecessary complication), but I admit to being wary as to how long it will last (I took off a star because of this); will try to update if it breaks within the next few months.",
