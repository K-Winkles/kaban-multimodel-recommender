That said, I expected installing this toilet to be challenging but it was very easy after my husband helped me unbox and carry it into the bathroom. I did the rest.I especially like the three bolt system of attaching the tank to the base as it makes the toilet extra strong and secure without any rocking.The height is perfect. You might think this toilet might be too tall but again, I'm only 5 ft. tall and it is just right .The only problem I had (and it really wasn't a problem) was this inside of the tank because the chain was too long and it wouldn't flush proplerly. It was an easy fix; all it had to do was move the clip on the chain down by six links and voila! It works great.I'm happy I chose this toilet.",

                "reviewText": "I received the Kohler toilet and seat (not included) as advertised to replace a shorter, leg numbing toilet with an ever-moving seat that constantly came loose. Uninstalling the previous toilet was the most difficult part. I made sure to save the hardware in case I needed it -- and I did. The new seat was easy to install, but did not come with the t-bolts to fasten secure the toilet to the floor. Not a problem. I also had to purchase a longer (16\") water supply line from ACE since the previous shorter toilet had a 12\" line that was exactly the right length - for that toilet. This toilet added 1-1 1/2\" to the height so it would not reach. Once I had that in hand, the installation went smoothly. I am extremely happy with this combination of toilet and seat. The height is perfect for us and does not cause the legs to fall asleep as the previous one did. In addition, the seat will not move. I can perch upon the throne with complete peace of mind and not worry that it will slip to the side. In addition, the flush is quick, efficient and quiet. We are very happy we finally made this change and wish we had done it before now.",

                "reviewText": "Ok. So I purchased a couple of these from Amazon and one of them had a small crack in the bowl that led to a constant dripping sound diagnosed by my plumber which took some time to figure out. Still dripped even with the tank removed (process of elimination).Called Kohler customer care and they quickly authorized to replace not just the bowl but the entire 2-piece unit under warranty. Kudos to Kohler. They issued me a warranty replacement letter (Kohler Letter_Warranty Replacement without Return) and asked that I provide that to Amazon customer service to have them replace it under warranty. The letter references my receipt, the model and authorizes the shipping of a new unit. Even spells out the Amazon/Kohler replacement credit process - (DISTRIBUTOR PARTNER: Please contact your dedicated Kohler Customer Service Team for inquiries related to the fulfillment of a warranty replacement order.)So after searching and finding the support chat option on Amazon customer care, Amazon would not accept the letter and replace the unit. They did say that they would refund the original cost if I wanted to rebuy the unit which is much lower than what the unit sells for today. At one point I had Kohler customer care on the phone and chatting online in a chat window with Amazon. Both were digging in their heels on how the unit should be replaced but then the Kohler Rep authorized just a bowl replacement using freight shipping and mentioned that I should not buy Kohler from Amazon but rather just call them directly in the future and that Kohler can discount if needed.Amazon - please pay attention to your manufactures and their established support / warranty processes that have been developed to help the customer. It sucks when it falls on me, the customer, to figure out how to diagnose and replace defective items. Be a good reseller or don't be a reseller at all.",

I did a good deal of researching toilets and finally decided on this Kohler K-3999-0 Highline Comfort 1.2 gallon toilet.What a great decision. It's so quiet. And one flush takes care of all the business.Plus it's good looking.I highly recommend it if your criteria is similar to mine.",
