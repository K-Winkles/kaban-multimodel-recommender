                "reviewText": "I am the shortest in my house and the toilet we had was a little low for us. We needed to replace it and was checking out various models. I seen this and got it as it was exactly what we had wanted. Perfect height for us and we don't feel like we're sinking into the ground. Comfortable to sit on, love the quiet close lid. The dual flushing saves on water. Very powerful flush as well.",
