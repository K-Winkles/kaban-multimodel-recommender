While I am overall pleased with the quality and performance of the product itself, soft water flow and no leaks whatsoever, I did encounter one issue upon unboxing it. Unfortunately, I discovered that the wrench that should have been included in the box was missing.Although this was a disappointing experience, I want to emphasize that the product itself is still of high quality and performs well. However, I do hope that the manufacturer can improve their quality control processes to ensure that all necessary components are included in future shipments. Overall, I would still recommend this product, but I would advise potential buyers to double-check that all the necessary parts are included before using it. I had a friend ordering the same product and yes, the wrench was missing there as well.",

                "reviewText": "I used to have one of the toilet seat bidets that work with your existing toilet seat. It was an amazing purchase, but after about a year, it was very hard to get the sprayers fully cleaned and sanitized because our water causes a black film to form on/in everything it touches after just a few days. The fact that it sat above the toilet water getting splashed and that it was used a lot because I suffer from IBS, it was constantly forming the black film, I decided to throw it away as I just couldn't bring myself to deep clean it every other day because I'm already in the bathroom way too often. A friend of mine recently bought a bidet similar to this handheld, and was telling me about it in light of the recent toilet paper craze. I figured there'd be no better time than right now to buy and try out a handheld. So after a few days of using it, I can already tell it is SO MUCH better than the seat attachment one we had. So much better control for all areas AND I can quickly and easily sanitize and dry it after every use without dismantling the whole seat! If you are in the fence about buying a handheld bidet, just buy one already, you won't regret it!",
