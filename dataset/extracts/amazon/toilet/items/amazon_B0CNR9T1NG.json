                "reviewText": "I was first introduced to a heated toilet seat with a bidet by a person I did some work for.I immediately fell in love with the heated seat Function and how nice it was. I have a bathroom that gets very cold in the winter so I was definitely excited to order this and not have a block of ice to sit on when using the bathroom. The seat arrived a day earlier and the instructions were a bit difficult to understand but my husband managed to figure it out and install it in a decent amount of time. The seat looks nice but once you touch the seat it makes a beeping noise and then the water starts to run from the rear bidet when. It wasn\u2019t even selected. The heat setting is turned up to the max and doesn\u2019t seem to evenly heat the seat. The bidet will randomly turn on for no reason then shuts off. I think the sensor is messed up or something but for the price of this seat I was expecting it to work Flawlessly and not to have an automatic water fountain in my toilet. I am not completely satisfied with this purchase and I will be purchasing a better brand one in the near future such as a Kohler just like the one the person I did work for had.",

                "reviewText": "EDIT***************************************************************************************************I'm editing the review because my solution solved a ton of issues I was initially experiencing, and after that the machine is working beautifully.IF your machine has the toilet light strobing, super loud (crackling sounding) beeps and the water heating or cleaning functions are not working: Un plug the machine for 30 seconds and plug it back in. Repeat this 4 -5 times as the first few hard resets did not solve my issue. Most of my initial complaints were solved by this fix as the water now heats, the spray oscillates, the toilet light doesn't strobe, the machine appears to clean itself, and the beeps have returned to a normal volume. I'm still taking off one star for the toilet connector as the metal one they provide will not make a complete seal and the metal blades could damage the soft plastic pipe threads behind your US toilet ( as it did to mine). Overall, the machine is a pretty good value for what it provides when all of the functions are working properly.OLD REVIEW*********************************************************************************************************I own a toto washlet and I bought this for a second bathroom. While the toto is easily twice the price it is also twice the machine. For starters, the metal adapter that shipped with the unit will tear up the plastic water connectors behind your US toilet and it wont make a complete seal. I ended up having to purchase another adapter off amazon and you probably will have to do that as well.Grievances: - The unit has an unpleasing beep that can't be shut off and beeps every time you lift the lid. - the water jet comes out ice cold before heating up. - the spray jet is a one trick pony that doesn't oscillate. You can move it back and forth by pushing the buttons constantly but you have to endure the beeps. - the toilet mounting system is inferior and not as secure as more expensive units. - the toilet bowl light is more obnoxious than useful. - the unit doesn't seem to clean the water jet even though it states otherwise.Likes: - the cold jet of water will wake you right up early in the morning.Honestly, just spend the extra money on a toto washlet. With that you will get user profiles, oscillating functions, instant warm water, a better mounting solution, beeps that don't drive you crazy, a nozzle that actually cleans itself a few times a day, a slow closing toilet lid, and a vastly superior Japanese build quality.",

Like oscillating spray, self cleaning and most important, bum drying. Has 4 levels of temperature for water and drying. You can also control the water pressure and adjust the position of the water nozzle to hit you in just the right spot. It has a nice display so you know if the temperature of the water is where you want it. The night light feature is nice but you have to turn it on and off manually. Installation was very easy and straight forward, the power cord is a little short and I had to add a power strip to reach the outlet. I'll be buying another one for my other toilet. It has auto and manual modes for cleaning, I prefer the manual mode so I can make sure my bum is clean and dry. The automatic mode has set times for cleaning and drying. The heated seat will be nice on those cold nights.",
