                "reviewText": "This was not an easy install. I am not a professional plumber, but I know how to install a faucet and do basic plumbing work. I chose this style of bidet because I really liked the design, and it should have been an easy install.I followed the directions, but the unit leaked badly. I took it apart and tried the tape, the provided O-rings slipped out of place and into the t-joint. After 2 hours I gave up. I went to a hardware store and purchased a box of #13 O-ring 7/8 x 11/16 x3/32. I placed one where the flexible hose connects to the provided t-valve and one at the bottom of the tank where the lock ring attaches to the other side of the t-valve. This second attempt took about 30 minutes and stopped the leaks.I could now test the hose and sprayer properly. My water pressure was high, so I made some adjustments at the stop joint. When not in use I make sure to turn off the water to the hose and sprayer. The easiest way to control the water pressure to the hose assembly is the lever on the t-joint.The hose is very long and sturdy, the color nice and I am using the hook that hangs on the toilet. This wiggles the lid a little so I may attach it to the wall at a later date. When I turn on the water the sprayer nozzle has a minor leak at the spray end.",

                "reviewText": "We've embraced the use of bidets for several years, even before the surge in popularity during the toilet paper shortages of the COVID era. It remains a standout investment for personal hygiene. While my current bidet functions well, its hose has developed unsightly rust. This new bidet kit includes everything necessary for a seamless replacement. The quality appears comparable to my old one. Anticipating eventual wear, especially on the hose, doesn't deter me, considering the significant savings in toilet paper over three years. Installation is straightforward for those familiar with DIY projects. If you're uneasy, consulting a plumber is wise to avoid potential water leaks. Having handled the installation myself, it took just half an hour from start to finish. Overall, it performs its function flawlessly. I highly recommend it.",
