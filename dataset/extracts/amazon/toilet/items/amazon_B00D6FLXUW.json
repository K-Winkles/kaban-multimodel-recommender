We also have an American Standard Champion 4 series which is by far the best toilet I've ever owned, and I've owned a few. So it suffers a little by comparison. The Champion 4 has never gotten blocked up requiring multiple flushes and/or the dreaded plunger. The Cadet 3 has only gotten blocked up 3 to 4 times in over 3 years with 3 women in the house so by no means is that bad. The Champion 4 has NEVER gotten blocked, and its flush just sounds and feels more powerful. If I had never bought the Champion I would say the Cadet 3 is the best toilet I've ever owned.",

                "reviewText": "Looks good - got the \"bone\" color - matched bone tub & sink.Came carefully packaged in two boxes - best packaging I've ever seen.EVERYTHING needed except the seat. Parts for the tank came fully installed.Remove old toilet, clean off old wax seal, and simply place the new wax seal (came with it) & put new the bowl in place. Bolt it down. Place the tank on-top the bowl, tighten down and hook up the water supply. Done.Best of all - it has a terrific flush. No multiple flushes needed.A GREAT PURCHASE - WILL BUY AGAIN FOR OTHER BATHROOM.",
