The single-knob control provides precisely adjustable flow to one of two spray nozzles. Rotating it backward controls one nozzle. Rotating it forward controls the other. Water pressure causes one of the nozzles to extend from its normally-retracted position (out of harms way). Installation was simple and straightforward. The absence of warm water takes a little getting accustomed to, and some might say refreshing. As others have said, upgrading to a slow-close lid alone would cost at least $45. Getting a full bidet for $40 more is amazing.",

                "reviewText": "Pros: very easy to install. The dial looks nice and feels sturdy. The jet hits the right spot and varies from a soft stream to very strong stream. It is very adjustable when installing. The seat is comfortable, but a little thicker or wider than normal toilet seats, so it is a slightly less compatible fit for a big guy. In general I, my girlfriend, and son all very much like it.Cons: I can't quite get a tight enough fit install, so the seat slides a tiny bit. I move as quickly as possible past the self-cleaning feature because it splashes the butt and the seat, and the seat is wet when I'm done.",

                "reviewText": "I had been contemplating purchasing a bidet seat for quite some time mostly due to physical limitations, but I\u2019d also experienced them many years ago throughout Europe, and appreciated the efficiency.With the purchase of a new home that has a ridiculously cramped en-suite bathroom between two bedrooms, and a toilet that is low enough to the ground to be suitable for a Lilipution, it was time.This bathroom will be completely remodeled some time in the future, but for now it just needed to be made functional without having to smash elbows into walls, etc.After a great deal of research it came down to this unit mostly because it was the only one that would fit and still allow the toilet seat to remain open on its own. There were a few electric units that might have worked but that would\u2019ve entailed installing electrical access, which will be part if the remodel eventually.SO... I went for it. The price was too good to pass up, and delivery was free and very quick. I received it before Christmas but today was the first time everything aligned to allow me to install. For me personally the installation took about an hour, but that is strictly a reflection of my physical capabilities (and OCD), the minimal space configuration of my bathroom, and the necessity of searching around for a crescent wrench to tighten the packing nut on the shut off valve that was loosened up a bit in the process of the installation. All things considered, this installation was a piece of cake and under normal circumstances would\u2019ve been accomplished in under 20 minutes. I literally only required a flathead screwdriver to remove the old toilet seat, and the wrench to tighten the shut off nut. The seat itself installed effortlessly with only finger tightening of all the connections. The only disappointment with the install was my toilet itself... one of the bolt holes is slightly skewed, therefore the seat is ever so slightly skewed, but not to the point of impacting functionality in any way.After the installation I attempted to check the function and discovered that turning the control knob just a fraction will activate the self cleaning wand function, which amounts to the water pouring out through the small and housing, straight down into the toilet. I thought that the wands were malfunctioning since they didn\u2019t pop out, so i checked to make sure the shut off valve was completely open to allow maximum water pressure. Tried it again, same thing. Then I turned the knob a little bit further...HELLO!! A word of warning, if you are not going to sit on the seat to test it out, I HIGHLY recommend wrapping your bowl opening with plastic wrap as those little wands will shoot water a couple of feet out of the toilet (in this instance drenching the front of my clothes) otherwise. After taking it for a true \u2018test drive\u2019 I will say that the water pressure is going to be a little tricky to get dialed in, to avoid an overly aggressive experience, but the ambient water temperature is not uncomfortable at all. \u201cPositioning\u201d is also going to be a little learning curve, as water can spray back or overshoot onto the toilet seat, if you shift just right.All in all, I am very happy with this purchase. It\u2019s an excellent price for a very useful piece of equipment that I think everyone should have in their home.Also, the lid is a bonus in two respects.. it is soft close, and it is sturdy. It\u2019s plastic, but not at all flimsy. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d try standing on it, but you can absolutely sit on it without it buckling, bending or sliding.",

                "reviewText": "Although the company have been nothing but lovely and helpful, the bidet seat was delivered in a damaged box. But I was so excited to have it that I tried to install it. 3 plumbing shops and 2 plumbers/ +2 tradespeople later, it was decided that the fittings do not fit Australian standard fittings. No available part is or can be sourced in australia, (even in a hydraulic shop). A refund has been lodged and sought, but the courier company is not local....which means a booking has to be made...but this has proven difficult. Still awaiting pick up (2nd attempt), which requires you to stay home for an \"all day window period\".I am disappointed my purchase has not worked out. I'm sure it would have been a wonderful product, if it functioned the way it was stated to work on the website.",
