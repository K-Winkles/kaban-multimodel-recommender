Yes, it looks pretty after installation because the nuts & bolts are hidden, but trying to one, see the bolts as you set toilet on them, & two, try to tighten the nuts on to the bolts is a major problem. There are holes to stick your hands in to tighten the nut onto the screw, but getting your hand in the hole is a problem & if you don\u2019t have the right tools to tighten the nut is another big problem, you have no movement to tighten up the nut at all! So, unless you plan to spend a lot of time with installation, this toilet isn\u2019t for you.",
