So much easier to clean w/o all those nooks & crannies that trap dust. This is in my guest powder room. It also flushes very well and quietly. I couldn\u2019t believe how quiet it is. Not at all like the cheap American Standard it replaced, that continually plugged up. When the plumber arrived and saw it, he said \u2018you bought a really fancy one, which is an great choice for guests\u2019.

                "reviewText": "This is a very elegant toilet and will improve the look of any bathroom. The flushing mechanism seems very fast - you press the handle and everything disappears. It does not come with a lid, so you will have to buy one. Even the bolts used to secure the toilet to the floor are nice looking! Shipping from Amazon is iffy. I believe these items are meant to be transported in pallets, instead of individual boxes because the packaging from the manufacturer is not very good. It comes in 2 boxes, one for the tank and one for the bowl. The first time I ordered it, the bowl was shattered! I called Amazon customer support and initially they wanted me to send it back (both boxes), so they could send me a replacement. Since the box was damaged, I mentioned I did not have a large enough box. At this point they asked me not to return anything. The second shipment came and this time the tank was shattered! Hence, it took 2 shipments to get one fully functional toilet.",

                "reviewText": "About the toilet:Its a very nice looking toilet, which is the primary reason I purchased it. It needed to match the 5-panel shaker style door and straight lines in my homes decor. The design and finish are great.I will agree with other commentators that flush handle, while looking good, does feel flimsy, and Kohler could do a better job for a ~$400.00 toilet here.If you have been looking at Memoirs toilets you know that there are about 20 model numbers all stating that they are a Kohler Memoirs toilet. This particular model is unique as it carries the styling design language (of flat straight lines) all the way around the toilet. On most Memoirs toilets, the area where the toilet drains (called the trap) is like all other toilets - its visible and is rounded. On this model the trap (the tube that drains the toilet) is concealed and the toilet appears to have a more \"Solid and planted\" appearance because of it. Additionally its much easier to clean the exterior of the toilet becuase there are far fewer nooks and crannies for dust and grime to build up.Performance:The toilet is a good performer, it flushes quickly and powerfully without splashing or otherwise creating a lot of noise or drama. It refills quickly, and while it inst silent, is less noisy than most toilets I've encountered when filling.Packaging:When purchased from Amazon.com, the toilet is shipped double boxed and suspended in plastic bag enclosed spray foam. This means that the toilet will arrive to you very well protected and you shouldn't worry about shipping damage on a delicate item. This also means you will have a lot of waste product to dispose of as you will have 4 boxes that can be recycled, but you still will need to throw away the foam and plastic packing materials.Other thoughts: You will need a wax ring and a toilet seat - I found this odd as the image shows a toilet seat with the unit, and its style is unique enough that it seems that there should be a memoirs seat to go with it (included, even). But alas, there is not. You must buy the seat separately. This will bring this toilet to nearly $500.00 if you purchase the Glenburry seat as I did (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UPSOGW/).Would I purchase this Toilet again?Yes. In fact I replaced my guest bath with another one, and I have two now.",
