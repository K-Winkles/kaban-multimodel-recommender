However, it was so easy to install, I didn't need a handy-person, I could do it myself. It's so slim that it fits under our nice, new, slow-shut toilet seat. Discreetly, the wand sprayer is hidden until you choose to use- for front or back. It isn't electrified so our high electric bill won't go up, it doesn't glow in the dark-who wants a glowing toilet? It doesn't play music or require a specialized seat costing several hundred dollars! ( who wants to invest so much when you want a new seat every so often anyway) In short, the BigCow is so a Big Wow! I actually take company into our bathroom and tell them how great it is and how affordable. It's true the water isn't warm but so what? Get it, you'll be glad you did",

                "reviewText": "It's a very basic bidet. It is easy to install, just make sure you thread it straight. If it's off, it'll leak. It comes with everything you need, except tools of course. It had plumbers tape, and even feet to help if the bidet attachment causes the seat to be elevated. The bumper feet would keep the seat from pinching you. I didn't need it. It fit flat under the seat and works perfect. The nob needs to be turned just a bit, as the pressure can be high. It is a cold water bidet, but its just from the faucet, it's not like ice water. It's really not bad and makes me feel much cleaner.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second bidet, so I have some experience using them and have been doing so since the great toilet paper crises of 2020.This one came with absolutely everything I need to install, including the nylon tape, and the plumbing parts were higher quality than I was expecting. The instructions were clear and I had no issues installing it (beyond getting behind my toilet), and I have had zero leaks in the nearly two months since I've been using it. I also love that my toilet seat isn't propped up at a bad angle like with my previous bidet, and it sits nice and flush (no pun intended) as it was meant to.The only thing I have to be careful of with it is when I first open the spout to the first \"click\" (by turning the knob), the water is a bit sharp, and I have to back it down halfway for my most sensitive areas. Opening it half way doesn't start the stream, so I have to open it fully and then close it a little so its comfortable. This could be due to my homes water pressure possibly, but I cannot be certain.Overall, this is an efficient little bidet and would be a great option for anyone who wanted to try one out! We go through toilet paper half as fast as we used to, so it has helped us save a lot of money. I would recommend a nice, thick, low-lint premium toilet paper to pat dry, as a little goes a long way, and you'll still be saving money!",

                "reviewText": "I hate when people say it's easy to do because when I run into problems I get pissed. Was a little challenging to set up because there is 0 space between my tub and water valve & connection. There just wasn't a lot of space for me to unscrew and screw things together. The design of the product is very simple and things aren't unnecessarily complicated but difficulty of installation depends on your bathroom layout.As far as the product goes, I love it. The water does come out like a fire hydrant if you're not careful but I really don't mind thay part at all . It does what it was built to do and that's all I ask for when buying something",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this bidet for about 2 months now and love it!! It was easy to install on my own and didn't take me long at all. I've been wanting one for years now and so glad I bought this when it went on sale. I bought microfibre cloths to dry myself after the wash so I can use less toilet paper and save money. And these cloths are washable, so I bought enough to last 1 week and sanitise them in the washer.I don't mind the cold water except in the middle of the night when I'm half asleep. At first, it's a bit of a shock, but I quickly got used to it. The controls hits the right spots all the time and I love that I can control the amount of water spraying out. I feel so much cleaner using this.I have recommended this bidet to several friends to tell them how to get cleaner and go toilet paper-less. I totally recommend this to you.",
