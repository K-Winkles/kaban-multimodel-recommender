We feel very clean after using it, so very content with that.One thing didn't go smoothly is that it kept leaking slowly every time we flush. We had to email the support. But luckily the support lady Natcha was helpful and after we sent a video, she quickly helped us figure out where should be tightened. After that the leak was gone. We are thankful for that.Although two things I think can still be improved: 1) the support phone number and website on Amazon page is wrong! It points to the car manufacturer Volvo's support and website, that wasted me some time to call them; 2) the connectors could use some better washer to make it easier to seal. We had leak in T connector in the beginning until we used one of our spare washer.",

                "reviewText": "What you're reading now is an update to my original, 2-star review. I'll be transparent about my interaction with VOVO to understand why I feel they earned a 5-star update.I originally reviewed poorly for the lack of memory of your previous settings; the bidet would reset to default settings with every use, which I found tedious. After leaving my review, I was contacted by a VOVO representative. They understood my feedback and immediately wanted to replace my unit with another, one that included a remote rather than a side panel and would remember your settings (VB-6100SR). I accepted the offer and was pleased with the product. The only sacrifice made was the side panel, but the remote includes mounting accessories and even an adhesive backing with holster to be able to place wherever you would like, so the sacrifice is small. Since this major issue is resolved from my end, I see no obstruction to a 5-star review. I'd like to commend VOVO for employing representatives that are keen and knowledgeable of their own products to resolve my situation, and I get the feeling that they will consider this with future models without a remote.PLEASE NOTE: As of writing, the VB-6100S model is the same price as this one. If you'd like your bidet to remember your most recent settings, please consider it.The original review I wrote will now follow:I truly want to like this bidet. It was easy to install, looks nice, and has the controls I would want.However, this will not remember the last settings you used. If you input a different nozzle position, water temperature, seat temperature, etc. while using it, this will be forgotten when you next sit on it. What's interesting is that it will visually show you (with LEDs) which settings you had used last -- until you sit on it, which is a reset.I had to return it for this because what should have been 1 button became 7.",

                "reviewText": "Ok, so when I obsess about purchasing something, I do an insane amount of research so I know exactly what I want and want the best deal possible. I wanted a solid performing bidet seat with as many bells and whistles as possible. It took all of five minutes to find Toto was the best, and way out of my price range. I then began to narrow my list down. Things I was looking for: endless hot water, spray strength, enema function, and nightlight. I didn't care too much about: auto opening lid, sittable seat, user memory, or dual nozzle (more moving parts equates more possible failures).This item hit all those wickets. However, with it being a new product and not many reviews, I was wary. There are a LOT of no name brand bidets coming out of Korea, and not all of them can be trusted. Most of the big name brands haven't come out with a new model in five years or more. I was considering Brondell or Bio Bidet, but couldn't decide between the two. I then decided to take a chance on Vovo, and so far I'm satisfied. Setup was easy, however previous reviews mentioned extra hardware coming and not listed in the breakdown- I received these as well. Night light is nice, but would've preferred a different color than white and an option to dim. The light is always on or off, no light sensor included. The seat warmer works, can only use on the lowest setting. Soft closing lid is convenient as well. The fit was almost perfect on my elongated toilet. The bidet function works well, water is warm, and pressure is good. The stream seems a bit narrow but does the job. There isn't a noticeable difference between normal and enema function- it's all about position. It does effectively clean. The rhythm feature is nice. The air dryer is not only ineffective- it's dangerous. I found that even on the lowest heat setting, my left buttock burned rather quickly. The heated air dryer is located on this side. I just pat dry with two squares of TP, and I'm good to go. The remote is clear and very easy to use. It is a bit cumbersome, however as it is very thick. Just place the mount in a convenient location and you won't need to worry about holding it.So, all in all I am pretty happy with my purchase. Build quality send fine, and the product has plenty of helpful features along with being effective. There are a few issues, but even the top brands have those, so at half the price point of the competition, I'll deal with it. I just truly hope this bidet stands the test of time, as I won't be able to afford a replacement, nor want to go back to an analog toilet.If you're like me and obsess over the research and can't decide between the BB2000 or SWASH 1400, save yourself $300 and give VOVO a try. Amazon accepts returns on this, so you have nothing to lose!",

                "reviewText": "We had it for 2 weeks now. Bough it on Black Friday sale with 25% discount,Installation was fine. No issue with the water connection, The seat fits our basic round toilet, although barely, with the toilet screw holes right at the very corners of the seat brackets. The seat is slightly bigger than the toilet, with outer edges hanging over slightly. For the electrical part we had to use an extension cord (and install covers to hide it) as we did not have an outlet right beside the toilet. I am pretty sure not many bathrooms do, but even then, it needs to be on the right side of the toilet when you look straight at it.The model we have features side control panel, and not a remote. At the time, with the sales and all, the difference was almost $100 and it did not seem worth it. Now I wish we weren't that cheap. The panel location is kind of awkward. Unless you're model-sized, your body partially hangs over it. It is also somewhat behind you when you sit, so you need to twist and reach, especially to use settings buttons located further back.Speaking of settings, we fully expected the device to remember them. It does not. I think the only one that is not reset is the seat temperature. Other, like nozzle position, water pressure, etc. revert to default after some time. Twisting and reaching to set them every time you use the functions is actually quite annoying.Also, the panel re-uses the same arrow buttons and light indicators for different settings to save space. Which one is being set, depends on which function is used at the time (i.e. if you are washing or drying) AND which setting button you pressed before starting the adjustments. So, not only you need to twist and reach, you also need to think and pay attention, all while sitting on the toilet first thing in the morning not yet fully present in this world.The water temperature seem to be okay at the default mid level, for the first wash. I does get cold if you use wash functions repeatedly. The default nozzle position is not working for us. It needs to be adjusted forward every single time. Not sure if the toilet model, or the device construction.Dryer is not the most useful. The air flow is weak (not adjustable) and pointed somewhat toward the seat, so instead of drying the butt it ends up heating the seat.That's it for now. We'll see if it lasts.UPDATE: changing from 3 to 5 starsThe company reached out to us the very day the review was posted. They provided detailed answer for pretty much every point I made, explaining technological limitations and design decisions. In addition, they offered various refund and free upgrade options. They sent us a 6100SR model, the one that comes with a remote instead of a side panel. Yup, that's right: the company rectified our mistake of choosing the cheaper model at their own expense.We are greatly impressed by the level of customer service, to say the least.The 6100SR model arrived today, and the remote is a game changer. Not only it makes the bidet functions easier to use from physical point of view, especially for my spouse who has limited mobility and had problems reaching for side panel. The remote functions are also much better organized than the side panel. It has a separate button for each setting, and a setting level is adjusted by repeatedly pushing the corresponding button. So, unlike the side panel it does not require selecting a setting first, then pushing arrows to adjust it. No remembering, no guesswork, a lot more sense.If you're choosing between models, the remote is absolutely worth the price difference.",

                "reviewText": "This is an excellent product and highly recommended!Packaging and Instructions are great. It was quick and easy to install in 15 minutes or so. Adding an electrical outlet close to the toilet was the bigger effort, but the pay-off has been more than worth it.High Quality Product - the main product and connecting parts (T-Joint and Water pipe/cabling etc.) are well made and are of quality high-end materials. Despite some concerns raised by others about the strength of the seat cover, while you wouldn't want to stand on it, and probably should take care when sitting on it, it is well made and does the job. I don't think you should typically use your toilet as a seat anyway.The functionality is surprisingly good. I was really impressed. It has certainly more than met my expectations:- Sensor on seat can't be seen but works well in turning on the fan/deoderizer and it's very quiet.- The warm seat is a nice greeting! Especially now that winter and the colder weather has arrived.- The deodorizer works quite well in reducing unpleasant odors.- The nozzle is adjustable and the cleaning function works very well, especially the pulse cleaning mode.- Water temperature is adjustable and the temperature variation is within a very reasonable range. Always lots of warm water even after multiple flushes, so it seems water is heat in-line real-time. Temperature might drop slightly for a second or two after a couple of flushes, but it's never cold or uncomfortable. I've never run out of warm water.- The LED light works nicely as a night light to guide you in the dark.- The air drying function is good and works, but I find it takes too long (just like air hand dryers) and so I prefer drying with a bit of toilet paper instead.Never realized what I was missing until now. Considering installing it in our other bathrooms as this bathroom is now the bathroom of choice for everyone and sometimes... you have to wait to use it :-)",
