Looks awesome in the bathroom.Now the customer service: Amazon delivered the toilet upside down, in the box, because the entire bottom of the box and half a size was destroyed. Nothing damaged upon inspection, but two weeks after installation, the toilet started leaking. Assuming it was a bad wax seal, I purchased a more expensive universal rubber seal. Again, about two weeks later, a leak. This time we bought a water vac, totally empied the box and the bowl, and flipped the toilet upside down on a gel rug. There was a small hairline crack found. Sent a picture to Woodbridge, and they shipped a replacement (on a pallet this time) under warranty. They were very easy to work with. I would highly recommend refusing delivery if the box arrives damaged, even if you do not initially see any damage. That was my bad, but Woodbridge took care of it. The re-installations and extra parts cost me some money, Amazon made that right.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this based on reviews here on Amazon and was not disappointed. I have installed and used dual-flush toilets from Toto and Caroma and I think the Woodbridge is better than both. The installation was tough, it is very hard to reach the bolts when the toilet is in a tight spot like ours between a wall and a vanity. But once it is in it looks really clean and sleek. The dual-flush action works really well: The internal mechanism looks very similar to the Toto, but there seems to be some of the water directed to the front of the bowl that gives it an extra push into the trap and leaves it really clean. Like all dual-flush toilets that I have seen the water spot is small so there can be more waste on exposed surface of the bowl. One tip on the set back: Ideally you will have 13\" from the wall to the center of the drain line for a 12\" setback - ideally you have an inch behind the tank on a toilet install. I had exactly 12\" from the wall to the drain and it was very tight to get the wax ring set onto the drain flange, not impossible but a struggle. I appreciate that the toilet comes as a complete kit with a very nice slow-close seat and a wax ring.",

                "reviewText": "I installed this toilet myself (with help from one other person to help move it into position) and found it to be straightforward and fairly simple. It sat flat on the newly tiled floor so nicely that I'm considering that it may not even need to be caulked at the bottom to the tile floor.I dinged it one star for the toilet seat (specifically the lid). It is black which understandably is going to show anything in the way of marks to it. But it is plastic and seems to be \"soft\". After the install I removed the protective plastic and wiped it down with a micro fiber cloth and noticed it scratched it pretty easily. I'm not sure what the solution is but that is something to consider. Something you will have to just make your peace with! It is a great looking toilet.",

                "reviewText": "Cute toilet! Easy to clean. We discovered the dual flush toilet in Asia and liked the sleek neat Euro design. It's just had this leak ever since installed in January 2018. We assumed it was wax ring not sealing off since water was leaking from underside and funneling behind toilet and started rotting shoe mldg behind and beside toilet (pics #2 & 3). We did not use toilet anymore. Just recently, a plumber removed to replace the wax ring only to find the underside of toilet (pic #1) porcelain was cracked. We spent $300 for this new toilet that was apparently broken from the beginning. I hope Amazon will help us and make this refundable.",

                "reviewText": "This was the second toilet purchase from Amazon. The first was a great modern design from Homture, but its packing was so poor that it arrived severely cracked at the rear of the water tank (I refused delivery after inspecting it upon delivery). I took another chance with this Woodbridgebath T-0019 unit knowing it was a little larger in length and width than the Homture unit. This had me concerned due to the extremely tight confines of the powder room where it would be installed. It ended up fitting and working just fine.Now to address the many comments regarding the difficulty of installing this toilet. Well, everything is relative: your skill level, the size of the space around the toilet, your flexibility, your creativity and your problem solving skills. Just for the record, I'm 66 years old, six foot, about 205 lbs. and enjoy doing renovation work on our home - from A to Z.The powder room where this was destined, is only 30\" wide. That's right, 30 inches. Today's building codes wouldn't allow for such a small 1/2 bath. It is ridiculously tight. That being said, I did not have too much trouble installing this toilet. I was concerned about the difficulty after reading all the reviews, but I managed to line up the bolts with the holes on my second attempt. Maybe I was lucky, but I did use dry mark pens to mark the position of the holes on the outside skirt of the toilet and made lines on the wood floor to show where the bolts were located. I simple had to line up the lines and lower the toilet from the front. In such a small room, this was definitely a one man job.As you can see from the photo, there was more room on the water feed side of the toilet. That was where I crawled in close to reach around the back to slip on the washers and to hand thread the two nuts so I could tighten them with the supplied plastic wrench. The water feed line from the previous toilet turned out to be the exact right length and fit. I actually had better leverage for tightening it by hand from the narrow side.Bottom line? Great looking toilet, works as advertised and at a great price point. But, I can see how this would not be an easy install for some DIY individuals.",
