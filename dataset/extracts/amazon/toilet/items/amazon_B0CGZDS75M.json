                "reviewText": "The upgrade to my old, ineffective toilet was made possible by the installation of this device, and I couldn't be happier with the results. My attention was immediately drawn to the clean and contemporary style of the toilet. My bathroom received a touch of elegance from this fixture, which, thanks to its white finish and compact, elongated design, gave the impression of being more fashionable and welcoming. Not only does the design of the chair height seem appealing to the eye, but it is also quite pleasant to sit in. It is ideal for those individuals who like a toilet that is simpler to sit down on and stand up from, and it also creates an experience that is more easily accessible and user-friendly. When it comes to reducing the amount of water used in the toilet, the dual flush option is a game-changer. I think it's great that we have the choice to pick between a flush that holds one gallon for liquid waste and one that holds 1.6 gallons for solid trash. This not only helps to save water but also brings down the cost of my monthly water bill, so it's a win-win scenario for both the environment and my finances. The plush, enclosed seat is a seemingly little yet really pleasant feature. There will be no more disruptive slamming of the toilet seat in the wee hours of the morning. The total experience is elevated to a higher level of sophistication as a result, and the ambience is kept calm and undisturbed as a result.",

                "reviewText": "Unfortunately, the skirting hit exactly the wrong place for my water valve, and installation would have required tearing out the wall and moving the valve. I wish I had thought to save the measurements to post here, because if I'd had them, I would have known not to order this one.The measurements that are on the spec sheet are accurate, FWIW. Just, if your valve is on the wall behind where the toilet is supposed to go, you may have the same problem unless you know for sure it's not going to hit the skirt. If your rough out is exactly 12 inches from the back wall and a side wall, and your valve is on the back wall near where the skirt might be, I would suggest going to a store where you can measure the actual toilet before buying.I do, however, recommend this brand. Everything about this toilet was gorgeous, and the company stands behind its products.",

                "reviewText": "Follow the installation instructions very closely but use common sense. We did not use the plastic cap or plastic washer that goes over the bolt. They are inside and the side covers hide them. It was very difficult to install. I would suggest hiring a plumber. It's very important to have plenty of space on both sides to guide the bolts through the holes of the porcelain on either side of the wax ring. Once it is set down and centered, it is a very sturdy toilet. It is not low to the ground and it is not too high it is the perfect height. My wife and I are 5'11\". It cost $279 well worth the extra amount.",
