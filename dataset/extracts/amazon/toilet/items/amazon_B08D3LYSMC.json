                "reviewText": "We had a huge toilet in our bathroom. The previous owner was over 6 ft tall. My husband and I are 5\u20197\u201d and below. He hated the taller toilet. So he ordered this one. It is the perfect size for us and fits more comfortably in the nook between 2 walls in the bathroom. It was easy to install. Very easy to clean. We love the dual push button flush. I took a star from it only because of the toilet seat. After so many uses, it has a habit of coming loose and having to be tightened down again. This can be a real pain if you don\u2019t know it has come loose and sit down on it and it slides toward one side or the other.",

                "reviewText": "This toilet moved the sitting position an additional 5\" from the door of our small powder-room so you don't feel like your face is right against it. It installs easily (no tank bolts, gasket, etc.) and light enough to position over the floor bolts. It flushes very well and with a very small amount of water, and the refill is very quick and quiet. I'm so glad we bought it.I was worried the ceramic might be cracked or broken during shipment, but it was totally encased in a styrofoam case inside the package. I think the handlers could drop it from ten feet and it wouldn't break.",
