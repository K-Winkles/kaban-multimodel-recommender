I think if we can ever get that figured out, then we will be completely satisfied. We love the smooth sides and that you can't see the plumbing. It's easy to clean because everything is smooth and no nooks or crannies for dirt & dust to get settled into. It's also very streamlined and doesn't take up much space, good for a room with a tight fit.",
