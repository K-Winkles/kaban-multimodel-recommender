The seat does take a little getting used to as it's not as circular as standard toilet seats are.I will say that customer service was absolutely stellar! The tracking listed the package as on thetruck for delivery for over a week when I finally contacted Horow for help. They promptly replied, looked into the issue and sent out another one right away.Overall I recommend this toilet for smaller spaces as it does provide more room around the sides than a standard size toilet. In addition it takes up much less visual space, and it is in my opinion quite attractive to look at and has a feeling of quality.",

                "reviewText": "So the first one i bought off Wayfair ended up being 1/2\" to long so I ordered this one and it'll work perfectly. Only a couple of knocks against it one being the toilet seat is very cheesy. Feels like an RV toilet seat but they do now sell a nicer one which i wish woulda been an option. The other is looking at the mounting fingers... They are made of plastic. I havent installed the toilet yet but im gonna make sure the seal is good and warm before install because I think the mounting screws will strip out very easily if you need to torque the toilet down flush. Ill update my review after install this weekend.Update.... Install was a breeze. Left the seal outside for a couple hours so it was really soft, so soft that setting the toilet down it squashed flush to the floor on its own. I guess the plastic brackets are good enough since the seal itself locks the toilet down. After turning on the water i did notice water was leaking somewhere and it ended up being the flush valve was loose on its base so unscrewed it and tightened up the screw on the seal and problem fixed. Nice lil toilet though, very happy so far. \ud83d\udebd\ud83d\ude01",
