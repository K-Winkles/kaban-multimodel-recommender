                "reviewText": "I am rewriting my review, but will leave the original at the end. I purchased the STO3, and could not install it, and returned it. This seller is top notch and truly cares about their customers! They reached out to me with advice about a new product they were going to have that WOULD work for me. It was a 3 month process in which they were NOT pushy or intrusive, yet present and helpful for returning, reordering and follow up on the new product install. When the STO3-pro arrived, I was thrilled. To review this amazing product, I have to start by saying that I was originally purchasing the product to help in the challenges of toileting and cleaning my senior mother with profound dementia. I needed something that would be comfortable (think pressure and temperature control!), easy to use on her for me as a caregiver and low maintenance. This smart toilet has adjustable everything: water pressure, water temp, spray positioning, front and back wash, seat temp and even air dry temp!! I have had it installed and working for only one week, and it has been amazing, not only for me to use for mom, but also for myself!!! I LOVE that this unit really does clean itself! I was surprised to find that the flush method, pre-wet on sitting, flush to remove original waste and a short flush before the refilling, works perfectly so far. For perspective, I have 4 adults and one young teen in my home, and historically have to clean the toilets every 2-3 days. Not the case with this one! I also LOVE the self cleaning bidet nozzle with built in UV sterilization! Very forward thinking. So, I would say as an instrument in assisting in care for my mother, the original reason for purchasing, this unit checks all the boxes.On to a normal review\u2026 this unit is a bit bulky, but it has a very modern sleek design which would look beautiful in any home. The smart toilet functions relatively quietly and is simple to use. The nightlight function is handy in low light situations and has a nice blue glow which is easy on the eyes at night. The remote control took a little getting used to with all the possible selections, but is quite user friendly and easy to figure out. I used plastic wrap to place under the seat over the bowl to experiment with the remote in order to see how the buttons effect the wash arm, very helpful to see what was going on, and made me more confident before the first use. The temperature controls are in 3 increments on each function, and the selected temp is indicated by light color above the button, blue, magenta and red. Again, very intuitive.Cons? Yes. There are a few cons, but nothing to make it rate less than 5 stars at this time! I believe the price is high, but that is only because you are getting what you pay for, and this is luxury at its finest! I don\u2019t believe that electrical outlets behind the toilet are the norm in the US (not yet, but this baby may just change that!) So that may be a con (though using an extension cord temporarily could be an option as it is just a regular plug) Also, at first, the seat opening every time one walked past the unit was unnerving. (Fortunately, the cat and medium sized dog have not activated the auto open of the seat.) I have found the sensitivity has slightly decreased as I have become accustomed to how far away to walk if not using the unit. Finally, I think it would be more conserving if there were a dual flush option. The unit flushes the same way every time it is used. It would be nice to have a different flush for urine only, but honestly, this toilet uses so little water for flushing, it likely wouldn\u2019t make an impact. The last \u201ccon\u201d is specific to my home. Our house is only 10 years old, but the distance from the water inlet pipe to the hole for the flange to put the toilet on, was about 2 inches too small, and the installers hat to make a hole in our wall to move the pipe far enough away to place the toilet. Not the fault of the smart toilet, but a con in my case. Just be sure to carefully read and measure and it\u2019ll be cake!In conclusion, this unit is as amazing as the customer service! It is the epitome of luxury with a small price tag for all you get! I may have had to wait a few months to get it all together, but worth every single moment I had to wait, thank you! Highly recommend!!ORIGINAL REVIEWI was looking forward to the bidet toilet with so many available options and adjustments, but we could not even install it. There should be a bold warning that you have to have a certain water pressure in order to even hook it up. (I have seen this warning in others, noted its absence from this model and went with it.)The product was delivered in a timely manner, and appeared in perfect shape. We did unbox it before we discovered our current pressure would not support the toilet.Extreme disappointment. Update edit: The company has reached out to me with a solution, a new product almost ready for just my situation! I will likely purchase and review it when it is available as the company seems interested in customer satisfaction!Thank you.",

                "reviewText": "We just purchased the ST03 Pro model. When we opened the box we were pleasantly surprised at the level of quality and how well it was put together. With all the functions packed into one package, it gave us quite a good value for money compared to all the other ones we researched.Pros:Great look and feel. Feels solid and well put together.The heated seat warms up quickly! No more cold cheeks on the lid during winters.Auto open and close works pretty well, the roller mechanism feels pretty sturdy and not flimsy at all.Water pressure from the pump was strong enough to flush waste away with ease.The bidet worked quite well with ample pressure, the water was warm right away. It even has water massage settings which was surprisingly comfortable.The instructions manual is very useful and clear\uff0c remote it came with made playing with the different settings super easy.Not really cons, but room for improvement:Maybe integrate the functions into an app instead of a remote? The entire installation process is easy, but the toilet itself is a bit heavy.All in all, this is a great and well-designed product, works extremely well and definitely well worth the price.",
