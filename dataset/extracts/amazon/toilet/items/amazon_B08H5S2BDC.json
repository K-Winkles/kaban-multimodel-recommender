I couldn\u2019t find this toilet in the color I needed locally and the only other retailer I could find said 10 week delivery.Now I really thought ordering a toilet from Amazon was weird but figured it was worth a try. The unit arrived as ordered but the tank and lid was damaged in delivery.I figured this was going to be a disaster in trying to resolve this. surprise surprise surprise, I called the seller and sent a picture and literally had replacement pieces days later, no stress.The toilet is good, but the seller is GREAT.",
