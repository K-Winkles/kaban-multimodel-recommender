                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars I found this to be a thoroughly cleansing experience, including installation",
                "reviewText": "No pictures. Why, do you want to see me laying down next to the toilet, or what else were you thinking?! Seriously, from opening the package, to using the product, I was all but blown away.Everything was packed meticulously, including simple, clear, and accurate instructions in standard English. Note to self: the compression washers for the fitting were under the teflon tape for wrapping the threads on the compression fittings and the (optional) screws for mounting the hanger on the wall. The stainless steel finish is a bit more impressive than the toilet on which I have it installed, but maybe your toilet is more impressive than mine.INSTALLATION: It installs directly under the toilet bowl.1) Turn off the water supply. Usually there is a valve near the floor or the wall just below the toilet, but if not you need to find a valve somewhere else and turn off the water. Then detach the supply line from the threads protruding from the bottom right (left as you face the wall) of the toilet bowl. (This is typically just below the level at which you sit on the toilet and usually directly under the tank, if you have a modern, American toilet.)2) I suggest wrapping the threads (plastic on my toilet, maybe brass on yours) with the included teflon tape, three complete revolutions is standard. Then take the fancy looking valve and insert the rubber washer into the female side (mates with the toilet side threads) and screw it in, making sure the connection for the hose (smaller) points out toward the front of the toilet, meaning the shutoff valve will point toward the wall. (You will not succeed if you try to install it without the rubber washer, don't ask me how I know this.)3) Once this is tightly attached (hand tight, that is), compressing the rubber washer somewhat, attach the connection that went from the toilet to the water supply to the bottom of the valve--note this will make the connection about two inches closer to the floor, so this may require either more bend in the flexible hose or some other adjustment in the water supply line. (The kit provides a second compression washer, but my (plastic) fitting was slightly different. You will not require this second washer unless you remove a similar washer from your existing fitting. Remember to do the three wraps of teflon tape for the smoothest connection.) Again, you are making a compression fitting, so it needs to be firmly tight, but not torqued--e.g., what is known as hand tight.) The connection for the spray hose should remain facing toward the front of the toilet.4) Attach the spray nozzle to the hose on the end that looks fancy. (You will have to remove the blue plastic inserts that were on the ends of the hose for shipping. You will note that the steel sheath is actually separate from the hose inside, which comes with compression washers fitted to the ends. Again, best practice is to wrap the threads three times with the teflon tape. It will look best if you are careful to keep the teflon tape on the threads, but not covering the end that will seal with the compression washer or sticking out past what will be covered when you (hand) tighten the hose onto the nozzle.)5) Attach the hose to the valve under the toilet bowl. (Three wraps teflon tape, firmly \"hand\" tight, placing the spray nozzle in the right orientation for use, since there will be no free swivel once connected.)6) Turn on the water supply, check for leaks. Turn on the valve for the spray nozzle, check for leaks. Spray into the toilet, so you get the feel for how to modulate the intensity of the flow by how far you depress the lever.7) Hang the spray nozzle hanger either on the toilet etc or remove the hanger bracket and mount the holder/holster to a convenient wall.USE: There are three common uses, yeah, even four. The fourth is cleaning dirty cloth diapers.WATER: It turns out that because these parts of the body stay so warm, and the water can be applied so gradually if you just barely press the lever, that even though we live in the mountains with cold water, we really feel no need to use warm water. This surprised me, as I have in the past only used this tool in places that are generally warmer. In the world as a whole, this is perhaps the preferred method for cleaning in the (not exactly mentioned) situations. This spray nozzle is a great improvement over the typical plastic nozzles I generally encounter around the world, because it is so much more adjustable--and did I mention, it looks too good to sell for what I paid for it. Perhaps they will raise the price if/when it catches on. When I wrote this, it was still cheaper than competing products, but has better specs. Surely this is too good to be true.In response to other reviews: I found the pressure to be easily and fully adjustable, but then I practiced with it pointed into the toilet bowl before I pointed it at...myself.",

                "reviewText": "Installation was easy, comes with clear directions with pictures. Took 10 mins tops. I initially had an issue with water running from between the sprayer and hose. Followed directions to remove snozzle and tighten screw but still found it leaked. Fixed the leak by applying plumber's tape and havent had an issue since. If you are using this for hygiene reasons, would definitely recommend some test sprays with the sprayer and make sure you have the right water pressure before cleaning. The water pressure is very strong on full blast. I have also found the included hanger to be pretty ineffective. The sprayer just barely balances on top of the hanger and doesn't hold it securely enough in my opinion. Other than that, I have had no issues.",

The installation process was very simple and straightforward and only took about 10 minutes.Finally, the device works very well and is simple to use. I have no issues with the hose or faucet leaking, and it produces a strong spray of water.This is a beautifully made and carefully packaged product. I just installed one of these on one of my toilets that cannot accommodate a bidet seat and is located by itself in a toilet room with no electrical outlet or hot water. I admit I was hesitant to order something that used only cold water but it's absolutely fine.I found this easy to install and easy to use. Came with all attachments and fittings. Great quality.",

Fast forward about an hour later....we go to use the bathroom and see that there's a massive puddle of water extending from the toilet room all the way out to almost the sinks and shower. There was an INSANE amount of water that was just leaking from the nozzle. We had not used it, and when we walked away after installing it was not leaking. The nozzle screw needs to be constantly tightened after every 2 or 3 uses, if not it leaks water again. If this continues I will un-install it and purchase from a different shop.",

It hose has 2 spray pressures. I promise you that after using this for a week and experiencing this level of clean, you\u2019ll not want to live without it. Bidets allow you to essentially wash your privares after each visit. You feel incredibly fresh afterwards! I would recommend for folks that live in hot climates like the South and MidWest USA where sweating is a daily activity and showers can\u2019t be slipped. There\u2019s also a wall mount option, but I like the toilet better. Don\u2019t think twice about being clean, just get it.",

I checked You tube videos as well to see if I am doing anything wrong, but guess what it is the product which is defected. Now I am not sure should I return it or buy a separate T- valve.
