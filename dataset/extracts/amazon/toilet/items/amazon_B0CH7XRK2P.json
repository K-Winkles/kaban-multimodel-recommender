I have nothing negative to say about any of it... especially for the price. highly recommend for both newbies and those already comfortable with a clean bum.",

It was very easy to install. It's not high-end... kind of more rear-end, but it offers a very cleansing stream. I mean, this thing will power-wash your... you know. You will only need toilet paper to dry everything off.The one other issue I see with it is that for those with a larger backside, the control arm may be a bit close for comfort as it lovingly strokes your outer right thigh as you're doing your business.Oh - and don't try turning it on if you're not sitting on it. I admit to having a blonde moment wondering if I could get a photo of the little water arm and managed to hose down a towel hanging on a rack on the opposite wall. I was secretly thankful it hit the towel and not the wall itself. Hoping it will dry off before my son showers in the morning.*looks around innocently*",

                "reviewText": "I have prior experience with using a cold water bidet, so I will use that experience to evaluate this bellearly Bidet Attachment for Toilet.This is about as basic as you can get. It is very thin, which aids in low clearance for the toilet seat, but in the same respect, it also feels somewhat flimsy.The sprayer is very low profile and fits right back against the bowl rim so it is out of the way. You can get about 1/4\" of adjustment back and forth to push it a little forward before locking the screws down on the seat. Here-in 'lies' the problems (or 'sits' in this case)..I have an oval bowl and seat. I found that as an average sized male I needed to sit way back on the seat for the bum wash. It was easier to use the feminine frontal wash for the bum instead.The Amazon posting shows 2 rubber washers come with this kit - one for the top of the adapter and 1 for the bottom. My kit only had 1 rubber washer. In the instruction manual they make no mention of those rubber washers or where they go . Having experience with installing plumbing fixtures, I knew where it goes, but other customers may not.Another feature I don't like is that there is not a very solid 'click-stop' when turning the knob to the off position (it does click, but it turns very loosely). This means you will often-times be needing to look at the knob to make sure it is in the off position when done using.I'm just not very impressed with this bidet.",
