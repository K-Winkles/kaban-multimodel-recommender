                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I made everyday use of this device, and the function that allowed it to shut quietly stuck out to me right away. Those sudden slamming noises are eliminated because of the regulated and gradual closure of the seat, which also contributes to a more tranquil atmosphere in the bathroom because of its presence. Providing an update that is both visually beautiful and functional, the bidet seat's extended shape is a seamless match to my existing toilet. Electric connections are not required since the bidet is powered simply by the pressure of the water. This not only makes the installation process easier, but it also guarantees that the energy efficiency is maintained, which makes it an environmentally responsible addition to my bathroom. In addition to ensuring the bidet's endurance and performance, the brass inlet is a trustworthy and long-lasting component that is included in its design. A hygienic experience is guaranteed each and every time since the nozzles retract and go through a process of self-cleaning after each usage. The adjustable water pressure and temperature settings enable a customized and enjoyable cleaning experience by adding an additional layer of personalization that responds to individual tastes.",

                "reviewText": "First, I wish this had easy-off hinges. All toilet seats need easy-off hinges, for easy installation and easy cleaning.Also, this does not have hot water. It is cold water only. For me personally this doesn't bother me. I've used both kinds, and my bum barely noticed a difference. Plus, the hot water one that I installed leaked, causing a mess.However, other family members preferred the hot water kind, especially in the winter.Also, for women using the front cleaning function, they may prefer warm water to cold water. Just something to think about.I do prefer the front cleaning function. The females in my household said they didn't care about that function and wouldn't use it, then ended up loving it.For me, it is absolutely essential to have a quiet close lid that doesn't slam down (especially with kids at home). Fortunately this one has the quiet close.In principle, installation is the same as any other bidet - just add a diverter to your incoming water supply line, and the only tool you should need for installation is a wrench.In practice, though, this is probably easier to install because there are fewer pieces, and you don't have to worry about lining up the toilet seat with the bidet. You don't have to worry about compatibility, or having enough space. In one of our bathrooms, the added bidet actually touches the wall - with this design, you don't have to worry about tight spaces like that.4.5 stars",

                "reviewText": "The bidet comes with everything you will need to install it. It fitted my elongated toilet perfectly and it was installed in as little as 30 minutes. First of all, make sure you shut down your toilet water valve and empty the reservoir. The adjustment to the toilet was very easy with the nylon screws, no tools required. The metal T-connector has an open-shut lever, in case you wish to shut the water supply to the bidet without affecting the operation of the toilet, very nice detail!After verifying that there were no leaks, the bidet was all set. The lid lowers itself very softly.The turning dial is very soft, it is very easy to adjust flow of the water jet and the specific nozzle (two).I would give this product six stars if they mentioned where to obtain the removable and replaceable nozzles.",

                "reviewText": "Americans don\u2019t know what they\u2019re missing not having bidets available. I installed a dedicated bidet during a bathroom renovation for my wife. It had hot water and she loved it and I came to appreciate it when I had \u201cintestinal disorders\u201d and was wiping myself raw with paper. It was a luxury that we lost when we sold that house. We spent too much on our new house and I can\u2019t afford a full on bath renovation right now but my wife really wanted the bidet again. This is a very reasonably priced, easy to install, alternative. Total installation took me 20 minutes, mostly to loosen the very corroded old connections. Everything needed is included except the tools and it was easy even for me, a non-serious handyman. It functions as advertised and while I was worried the cold water might be \u201ckind of shocking\u201d it\u2019s really not uncomfortable. My wife is happy. A hot water bidet is preferable but this is an excellent alternative if that\u2019s not possible. Make sure your toilet is of the modern elongated design. I\u2019d buy again and would recommend.",
