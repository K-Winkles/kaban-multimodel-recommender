                "reviewText": "\"The Toilet\" is essentially a romance, a cruel romance in which a young man from a homeless shelter, Kelvin Oliver, is prepared step by step to live his life in the protagonist's bathroom, his head in a box with a toilet seat over it, swallowing down whole turds without chewing them. Kelvin loves with all his soul. The toilet \"'[needs to realize what it is getting itself] into' she [says}, with a hard edge to her voice. 'Toilets stay in bathrooms, always available for use, day and night. They do not have holidays. They stay in darkness except when they are being used. They have no other function. They do not speak, they do not laugh, they do not think, they do not cry. They swallow whatever is put down them and nothing more. They do not sleep. They wait, hour after hour in darkness, for that brief moment of usefulness. Their world is a tiny, windowless room where nothing changes. No seasons, no sky, no weather, no nothing.\" But Oliver will do anything to be near his love, submitting to the cruelest of services. He sexualizes and eroticizes the swallowing whole of those love-objects produced by the body of his lady love. It is the ultimate love story and a towering literary performance to make this feel sublime and to make it feel entirely real and sensual. Ms. Pain is magnificent . . . If you have any masochistic bent at all you will long to be her TOILET.",
