Uses less water than most but because of the whirlpool flushing action it has tremendous power. I\u2019ll definitely get another.I installed it myself. Easy to install and the skirt makes cleanup super easy. The only issue I ran into was that the previous toilet was a standard toilet not a skirted toilet. That meant that I had to move the water supply a couple of inches so it would clear the skirt.",

Installed this morning. Was fairly straightforward. However i realized there was no seat. After checking the description, it clearly states there isn\u2019t one so that\u2019s on me BUT .. a $500 toilet doesn\u2019t include a seat? Really? All the pictures for the toilet clearly show one installed and I feel it\u2019s a little misleading. All and all, I would not purchase a toilet from Amazon again. Bad experience all around.",

                "reviewText": "Absolutely beautiful and just the right height. We just remodeled our powder room and we were looking and reading reviews on lots of toilets. I wanted something modern but durable as we often have kids together. This fits both needs. We had a contractor install so not sure a out the difficulty. I do know that we had to pay extra because it's not a standard size toilet. Well worth it. I'm getting 2 more for the other bathrooms .",
