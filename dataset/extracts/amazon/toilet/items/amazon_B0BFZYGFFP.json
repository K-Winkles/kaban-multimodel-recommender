Perfect for smaller bathrooms and powder rooms where space is at a premium, the compact elongated shape takes up the same space as a round-bowl toilet, yet its elongated shape adds added comfort. Its 1.28-gallon high-efficiency flush provides water savings of up to 16,500 gallons per year versus an old 3.5-gallon toilet, without sacrificing performance. Revolution 360 swirl flushing technology keeps the bowl clean longer, and the chair-height compact elongated bowl makes it comfortable to use. A Quiet-Close seat is included.",
