Install was easy even for being the first time I installed a one piece toilet. With that said it is a bit more challenging to get into its final resting place because it is one piece and its a bit heavy. Definitely get help to move into its desired location and install.

Install was straight forward. What you\u2019d expect. The quality is a lot more than an American Standard or any other similar brands. Quick, quiet flush and easy to wipe clean. Comfortable seat.",
