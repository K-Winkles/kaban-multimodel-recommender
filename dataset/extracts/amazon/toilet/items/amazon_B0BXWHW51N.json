                "reviewText": "This is a high quality product and relatively easy to install. It did not come with installation instructions, which would have helped. The necessary washers were included but in my case some were not required and actually provided a tighter leak-free fit without them. I do recommend using some plumber's tape, though. Everything is metal and brass, so I expect that it will work well for years of use. The diverter that attaches to the toilet tank acts like a master switch to adjust the water flow to the sprayer. But, I just have been leaving it on and using the button on the sprayer nozzle and have not experienced any leaks/drips. By twisting the nozzle head you get either a soft flow for regular bidet usage or a spray flow that I've been using to assist with toilet cleaning. Overall, I am very pleased that I got this unit.",

After using it for a few months I couldn\u2019t imagine not having it we love it.Just a heads up we did have to move the water line over and back a couple inches as these toilets do not sit like a normal toilet as bolts mount from inside. But nice part about that is they are much easier to clean no stupid sides that are hard to clean. I tried to take a picture of hole to show where water line came out that we moved over. Also if you do t have power you will have to add power.The toilet works just as advertised. It has many functions we love the touch less flushing, night light, heated seat, warm water, and air ect .The water temp and seat temp only show in Celsius as there is not away to change that but no big deal.It has a lot of functions and takes a few times getting use to the remote and all functions but it works great without breaking the bank on some of the name brands.When I remodel our guest bath I will order another one.",

                "reviewText": "I thought this would be easy to figure out, but as one on-line instructional site says, \"Bidets may take some getting used to.\" I'm still getting used to it, having gotten water all over the floor on my first try. I'm sure it's doable, but I probably need to adjust the water pressure lower, and figure out which direction to aim... UPDATE: I have experimented with it, and managed to avoid the water on the floor problem. I think the idea is to aim the nozzle with one hand and adjust the water flow with the other. This is doable, and seems to work well (start out with a low flow, of course).Installation: This comes with no printed instructions, and the instructions in the manufacturer's description are a bit vague. It comes with a bunch of rubber washers, and the general layout is as shown in my first picture. Notice that the supplied hose is different at the two ends: the end that has a nut-like fixture attaches to the T-valve, while the end with the slightly conical fixture attaches to the hand-held nozzle. The bigger end of the T-valve (up in my picture) attaches to the bottom of the toilet, where your water supply line attaches now, and the smaller (lower) end of the valve attaches to the water supply line. (The picture in the description has this valve upside down.)The description says it fits 99% of US \"tiolets\" (sic). I of course had the 1%. Water supply lines are usually braided steel (or if cheaper, plastic hose); mine was a solid metal tube (see my second picture), which wouldn't have fit. I was able to wrestle this off, and I bought a braided replacement hose (third picture--pay attention to the connector end that attaches to the toilet, hoses for sinks are similar but have a different connector). I got a 9\" hose, since that was just a little longer than the solid pipe I was replacing. But the T-valve is tall, and the braided hose barely fit. The hose comes with its own rubber washers, no need to use one from the bidet kit.The connections are pretty secure, I had no leaks (once I remembered to include the rubber washer--these fall out easily when you're moving stuff around, at least that's my excuse). The only connector that's a bit tricky is the one that attaches to the fitting coming out of the bottom of the toilet, which feels round (it actually has two flats) and is a bit hard to tighten.My final setup is in my fourth picture.The manufacturer's description says you'll use less TP. I don't think so, you have to dry the water off. But I think I feel cleaner. And next time I hope not to get water on the floor...",

The context is absolutely lost in the wording.The temperature is Celsius onlyThe valve and hoses are built with either a non US standard thread pattern or the threads are held to poor tolerances. We had to work quite a bit to make them work, in fact we built our own shut off valve.The dry feature is odd in that it shoots water around the bowl first, you'll have to read the directions for a comical translation reason. It does however rinse with such force that other parts get wet before the dry cycle. Use your imagination.Again, it's ok but not great. Worth the money but expect challenges.",

Even with the rubber washer rings that were included I had big leaks from the bidet hose and the handheld part and at the part that joins the toilet bowl.
