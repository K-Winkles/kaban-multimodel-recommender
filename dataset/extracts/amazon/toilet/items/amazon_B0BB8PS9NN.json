It is easy to install and isn't expensive like a bidet. Aside from being more expensive, I find bidets to be finicky when adjusting the water and its pressure, but this product eliminates that problem. This hose allows you to have full control of where you want to spray and the water pressure you prefer. Oh, and a bit of a pro tip: if you prefer warm or hot water instead of cold, you can attach the hose to your sink instead. I personally don't do this since my toilet is not next to my sink, but my parents have it installed like this and it works just as well. I also like that it has a handle that hang on your toilet tank for easy storage and convenience. I think every one needs to have one of these in every toilet and there's honestly no excuse with how easy to install and inexpensive this is.",

                "reviewText": "I am very pleased with the quality and craftsmanship of this handheld bidet sprayer. It\u2019s easy to install and has a nice appealing style, which goes with the rest of my bathroom\u2019s hardware and decor. The T valve is made of metal material, not plastic, which I find very important. No leaks. The pressure is a bit strong, but you can easily control it by applying light pressure to the sprayer. It is a very convenient hygienic tool for those absolute moments, especially for women!! Make sure to turn the valve to off position and spray any remaining water that\u2019s in the hose after each use.",

                "reviewText": "So we recently tried this bidet. It has many great things. The setup is so easy that even a kindergarten kid can install it. Great job by the engineers. Now second, the pressure is perfect too. The only problem we are facing is after 4-5 seconds of usage, it back fires water from the handle. This is something that the company should rectify. That leakage does feel disgusting though its just normal water but happening at a wrong time.Update: A new issue has come up. The leakage is now happening from the nozzle.I think if this is manufacturing defect, I suggest don't buy this product.",
