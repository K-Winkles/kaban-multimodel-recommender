It is DIY, so you will need a handyman or handywoman to install it.All the hardware you need to connect to your existing water line, to fit under your existing toilet seat, and to adjust to your particular bidet spray needs, is included.After opening the box, familiarizing myself with the parts, removal of my toilet seat, connection to the water line, and reseating the toilet seat, took about 30 minutes. Instructions are very helpful and specific for each step in the process, and I did have the benefit of this being my second time installing a bidet attachment in our home.This model by Aunsffer has a self cleaning function, a super slim no gap under the toilet seat (so your seat doesn\u2019t rock in place), and has a bidet wash and feminine hygiene settings. These two settings allow the best placement for the parts you want to clean.",

                "reviewText": "If you're in the market for one of these (if you're reading this, that's likely the case), this will fit the bill quite nicely. Any installation involving plumbing can be a pain, so given that, it's as easy to install as anyone could make it. I did have an advantage in that I was replacing a different model of bidet that had cracked, so it was a bit easier. I didn't like having to screw the control panel on to the main body of the bidet - one of the 3 screws stripped even though I was careful, so I'll have to keep an eye out for leaks. So far so good. The only problem I have with it is the placement of the controls. They're close to the toilet seat, and I'm a big guy, so if you're like me it takes a little leaning to get to the controls. Not a huge issue, but it would be nice if they were moved out a little. Then again, the reason my old one cracked is that I accidently pushed down to hard on the control, and the arm connecting it to the wash head cracked. Having the control closer to the seat will help that, but at the expense of having to lean a little. In any case, these are very nice devices to have, and this one will work well for you.",

                "reviewText": "I have ordered and reviewed several entry-level bidets on Amazon, and this type is definitely the one that I prefer most. The ones that are built-in to the toilet seat are creaky and make the hole in the seat a lot smaller. Not so with this one.These universal bidets are wedged in between the porcelain and the toilet seat, to the opening does not change. The mounting material accommodates an incredibly wide range of distances, so it will install perfectly on just about any toilet where the sear is held in place with 2 bolts.Controls are simple (not much to it), and the pressure is excellent. I have 2 of these in my home, one of them has been around for almost a year. No problems so far.For the price, this is a must-have item. The savings in toilet paper alone will pay for it in no-time! HIGHLY recommended!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have only tried a bidet once over a decade ago in a hotel in Europe. I was not overly excited about the experience then, but also had no idea what to do. I wanted to try this attachment to our toilet to give the concept another chance. I like being clean, my bum after going potty is no so much clean. Round after round of wipes gets you cleaner, but I thought a wash might be better. This attachment took me less than 10 minutes to install and was so simple. All you need is a small Phillips head screw driver and a wrench; it comes with everything else.So how did it do?Fantastic! The water did exactly what you hoped as I was completely clean on the first wipe after using it. There is a dial so you can control the pressure to whatever is most comfortable for yourself. I was concerned the water would feel too cold, but it's not at all. The whole process takes only 5-10 seconds which actually saves time and a lot of toilet paper. Most importantly, I really do feel cleaner when done.Great quality product and highly recommended to give it a try. My only problem now is that we need more of the bidets for all the toilets in the house or my bathroom is going to get far more use.",
