I got this one for our downstairs bathroom, the one most used, and it was super easy to install, the instructions are straightforward and it's super easy to use and clean. It does have surprisingly strong pressure, so be very careful when you're getting used to it to slowly turn it up, lest you give yourself another booty hole but it works really well, it keeps things a lot cleaner than toilet paper and is pretty \u2728fancy\u2728it's a super simple and quiet flex that people are super impressed with, thinking it's so insanely bougie when it's literally already paid for itself in money saved on buying toilet paper",

The first couple of uses were jarring. Like sitting on an icicle. (especially since it is winter) But once I got use to it, it was quite refreshing.The only issue I have with it, is the pressure goes from a soft stream to accidental enema with nothing in between. So be careful.The nozzle cleaning is a nice addition. As well as the raised arrow so you can feel where the dial is pointing before you shoot.",

Second was how fast it would get here and the third was the easy installation my husband still wants a parade for.You don't want to hear the fourth because it refers to levels of bodily sanitation-based satisfaction that even I still can't dream of. It reaches all of your parts with a powerful current --or a gentle stream (it's your choice) of water that removes all evidence that your bowel had a movement. It's would be 5 stars if not for the fact that the water can, at times, be too strong and do ruin to the sensitive underbottom. I recommend to everyone, though.",
