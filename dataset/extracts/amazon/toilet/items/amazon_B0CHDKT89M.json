The coating also seems a little weak - my cat is insane and likes to gnaw on everything and she made some tooth marks that seem pretty deep.

Since we were changing the accessories to black we quickly realized that the old chrome fixtures don't match anymore so anyway long story short we wanted a new modern looking toilet roll holder to match. I really liked the simplicity of this one and the price was right. My husband installed it the same day it arrived. It was super easy to put in and I love the way you simply lift the bar up to change the toilet paper roll. It actually looks really great and matches the other new black pieces in the bathroom. I have to say it seems like a great quality piece for the price. I love the look of it and how easy it is to use. I mean, there isn't much more to say about a toilet paper roll holder other than it does its job and looks good!",

                "reviewText": "The lift up bar design is clever, and it helps that the installation instruction paper comes with the drill hole template drawn on. The problem is that the two \"columns/covers\" that fits over the wall mounting plates are designed to be pressure fitted. In other words, you have to press the columns onto the plates. It's a really tight fit (pressing metal onto metal) that requires quite a bit of force, and I don't foresee that they will fall off once pressed on, but there in lies the problem. If you ever need to remove the columns, especially off a drywall installation, it seems inevitable that you will end up ripping out big chunks of the drywall itself. There's no screw holding the column onto the plate like most TP holders. For this reason, I decided not to use this product.",
