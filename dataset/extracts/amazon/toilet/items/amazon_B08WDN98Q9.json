                "reviewText": "After much research I chose the IMUS brand of bidets--one with air dry capacity, the other without.I have had these 2.5years and they are great.Major Benefit :These are instant-on, tankless water heaters you don't have to run a separate hot water line nor do you waste any energy heating and reheating a water reservoir so typical in most other brands...(Not to MENTION: once those reservoirs run out: alluvasudden!! - one has the shock of a cold-water rinse! AAARRRGGGHHH!!! ) ;-/The lowest setting of the heated seat is a wonderful luxury in winter and can be turned off altogether in spring/summer or whenever ambient temperatures allow.The air dry works fine, with the only drawback being the time added the time to dry (so I seldom use it); however, if one has hemorrhoids or other sensitivities to the touch in the perineal area, the air dry is an essential game-changer. (How do YOU spell relief? ;-)Perhaps because of its long history producing bidets, this Korean company provides what I find is the best feature-packed price-to-quality value I have found in this category.AMERICANS: smarten up! Once initiated, you'll wonder why we're so far \"behind\" the rest of the world!Not only is a bidet so much more hygienic, it ultimately pays for itself in the amount you save when your toilet paper usage plummets!Yah....go ahead...no reason NOT to--UNLESS YOU HAVE NO ELECTICAL OUTLET/AVAILABILITY IN THE BATHROOM!)OH, and although it is clearly stated in the instructions.... you absolutely cannot sit on thetoilet lid once closed. It will not stand the weight.Hopefully you can 'stand the wait' for you new bidet once you've ordered! ;-D",
