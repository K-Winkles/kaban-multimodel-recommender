                "reviewText": "This review is specifically for Woodbridge T-0737 one piece toilet with built in electronic bidet. The reviews found here are obviously for all Woodbridge toilets, not just this model. I ordered and installed 2 units at our home, we already have 2 other electronic bidets on 2 other Kohler Riator one piece toilets and have been using them for many years.The form is beautiful, one piece smooth aerodynamic oval shape, rivals any of the $4000-$7000 modern toilets, just right for our modern all white d\u00e9cor and perfect for any mansions. The bidet fits perfectly forming a smooth oval spaceship like sculpture. A very beautiful art form by itself.The height is just right for 6\u2019 tall male and shorter wife. The flushing is flawless with no mark. The sitting water level is good, a little on the low side but not as empty as those new annoying European toilets, the water level is perfectly fine. The tank top buttons work perfectly, instant flushing without delay. This does not have a deodorant feature, our 2 other bidets have deodorant feature, I notice no difference.The electronic bidet is perfect. Water pressure is gentle yet effective, seat warmer is a bit too hot for me at full level, I use level 2 out of 5 or 6, adjustable nozzle position is good, fan is powerful with adjustable heat. Massage function doesn\u2019t do massage but moves \u00bd\u201d back and forth to handle a far more effective function, with minimum paper needed. The size and shape is a perfect fit for this spaceship like all white smooth oval toilet. Water tank is hidden in the overall over one piece art form.The installation was done by plumber, $400 for 2 toilets, including disposal of 2 older Kohler Riator toilets. One bathroom is 3 levels down, a bit of extra work by 2, as all these toilets are very heavy. Woodbridge unit is 152 Ibs. It took 1.5 hours to remove and install each toilet, plumber said it is very easy, no complication, I did not help.This Woodbridge T-0737 one piece toilet with built in electronic bidet is so wonderful, it is now the only one I use, it is like civilization just arrived here at home, even though we have 4 bidets at home. I immediately ordered 3 more Woodbridge T-0737 one piece toilet with built in electronic bidet, 1 for my office, 2 more for my son\u2019s home.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is a great toilet, I love it. It is quite tall and the seat is somewhat angled so you sit quite forward than in a regular toilet. The bidet is nice but not perfect. The pressure is not very high. I've had free standing bidets and they give you a lot more pressure. The drier is nice but doesn't really dry very much its more of a warmer. So much for reducing the use of toilet paper. You are going to need to dry your behind with toilet paper unless you are prepared to wait 10 minutes air drying your butt. I'm not saying that the toilet isn't great, it is. I am very happy with it. I just want to keep your expectations realistic. Its a toilet with a bidet and a drier built in. It's not going to be as good as three separate dedicated things. For a tiny bathroom its awesome. Also it has a night light. How cool is that?",

                "reviewText": "Everything about this toilet is excellent except 2 things. The seat automatically turns on when you sit, and off when you get off, the blue light is bright but not jarring and also automatic (light sensor). The blow drier is a bit gimmicky but gets plenty hot, the massage function means you don't have to shimmy around while washing but there are 2 main issues. Installation is a headache, it's super heavy, it's one peice and the bolts are hidden, which looks nicer once it's installed but I went through 4 wax rings guessing if the bolts were lined up or not (you can't see them). The other main issue is the bidet pressure it just *barely* is enough on maximum pressure. My $20 \"luxe bidet\" addon could get painfully powerful if you wanted it, this thing doesn't even come close. It works, but it would be awesome if the pressure was there.",

                "reviewText": "I spent a great deal of time researching options before making this purchase. I have wanted a toilet/bidet unit for several years. So, as we planned the remodel of our master bath, this product came to my attention. We had the bathroom professionally remodeled and and the bidet installed by the contractor. However, it is heavy and I did assist when it came time to set the base of the unit. Installation went very well with no surprises along the way.This is day two with our new Woodbridge and all I can say is this... I have been using the restroom incorrectly for my entire life. I no longer consider this a luxury purchase. To me, it is a must have and I do not look forward to using a restroom away from home. I plan to purchase two more of this model to install in the other bathrooms in our home.I find this to be extremely easy to operate and the quality of the unit seems to be top notch!*Update 4-5-21 Still extremely pleased with this product. So much so, that I am ordering three more for our new home that is currently being built. Could not imagine going back to toilet paper after using this toilet/bidet.",

When it didn\u2019t work, they sent a new bidet attachment. That has worked fine for 6 months but the water flow and width of stream just doesn\u2019t get the job done. I wish I had just paid more for a reputable brand. The other functions are adequate but the whole reason for buying was to get a clean hole without wipes..",
