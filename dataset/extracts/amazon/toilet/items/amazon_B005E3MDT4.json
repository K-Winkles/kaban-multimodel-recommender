Class Five Flushing Technology Class Five flushing technology is designed for extraordinary bulk-flushing performance. Its large flush valve allows the rapid release of water combined with a direct-fed jet to keep your bowl sparkling clean. The canister flush valve allows water to flow into the bowl from all sides, increasing the power and effectiveness of the flush. The durable canister design has 90% less exposed seal material than a 3\u201d flapper for leak-free performance. The universal red seal lasts longer because only a small area is exposed to tank water.",

When we notified them that the tank cover arrived cracked in half (the rest of the toilet was fine), they immediately gave us a generous concession on the price that was way more than enough to buy a new cover. Thanks, Amazon!",

                "reviewText": "We had this toilet in our guest bathroom, and in renovating another house, decided to buy the same unit again as I have NEVER had to plunge this toilet, and it is a really beautiful design. A few things to consider, however. Since the base is so large, you are going to be more prone to experiencing an unlevel toilet, as the wide base exposes more floor area. If you have a tiled floor, you may have to shim in a few places to get it not to rock if your tile isn't spot on perfect.And regards to the seller of this toilet. It is SUPPOSED to come with a seat. Ours did not, and did not find out until install day. I purchased the replacement at Lowes (a whopping $42). Amazon, being an awesome company, credited me back the money I spend on the toilet seat. The unit that arrived did NOT come with a wax seal kit. The previous memoirs toilet we purchase did. I don't know if Kohler stopped providing them, or this was accidental.",
