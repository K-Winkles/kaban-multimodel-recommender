                "reviewText": "When I received my bidet on Aug 25th, I was very excited because I never experienced one before & not only was it going to be my 1st time, but I was going to feel even more proud for being able to install it without any assistance. It was very simple, as I had everything I needed with the exception of a drill to bore a hole through the side of my sink cabinet for the hot water line. That in itself was no big deal. I had someone that would be over shortly with what I needed, but in the meantime, I just wanted to hook it up to give it a little test run. It was a little tricky as I needed to be careful to screw everything on secure enough to avoid leaking. I managed to get it just right. I tried it & it was amazing. I'd say that I played with it a handful of times before my company arrived to drill the hole in my cabinet. It worked perfectly until I hooked it back up & the water pressure turned to complete crap.....dunt...dunt....duuuuuuuhhhhhhhThis is what I learned. Due to no fault of the company, the product I received failed. I feel however that if you are a person with plumbing that you are not in the habit of turning on & off at the point of connection, then it would be a very good idea to let the water run through the lines prior to completing your connections to the bidet. Do not do this just one time either, but turn the water on then back off several times before connecting. I say this because I noticed there were small black flecks coming out of the bidet while I was running it until my 2nd attempt at connecting & the water nearly completely stopped. All it wanted to do afterwards was dribble out therefore making what was an awesome investment into your basic trash. Now I'm completely convinced that those little black flecks managed to accumulate in the unit preventing it from functioning properly & once that happened, there was no way to clear it out. Stick a fork in it, it's done.... : ' ( So yeah I felt like a very disappointed kid that just wanted to get on the fun ride & the moment it was my turn.......it broke. Needless to say after trying to play with the unit a few times to get it to work, in the end, it defeated me.I had no choice but to jump back on here to begin the return/replacement process. Out of my disappointment though, I will say that the return process was very quick, convenient, & extremely painless. I selected the option for UPS to come pick up my package. They slapped a sticker on the side of the box, then took it away the very next day.....yeah I didn't have my bidet an entire day. I received it Monday evening, Aug 25th & had to return it Tues, Aug 26th. That really sucked.Anyway, my story continues & does have a happy ending. I received my replacement bidet earlier than the estimated arrival date. I receive tracking notifications on my phone, so I was very happy to get the message that my bidet was handed over to my postal carrier & would be delivered today, Sat, Aug 30th & not Wed, Oct 3rd.....AWESOME!!!! Armed with my new knowledge, I did what I have now advised you to do & that was to connect the lines to the water supply then run the water through several times to clear them of the black flecks I noticed previously. Another thing that I did which I haven't already mentioned, was I shortened the hot water line to the desired length before connecting it to the sink adapter. You definitely want to do that because once you get that rubber hose on there, it's most likely not going to come back off. I tried it the 1st time.....it was on there for life. Once I took care of the water lines & managed to get my connections secure with no leaking, I turned on the bidet & it now works as it should.I went through a few of the reviews before and after my purchase. Honestly, I understand some of the gripes. Sure the unit is plastic, but since I live alone & I generally take care of my things, I don't foresee this breaking on me anytime soon. I'm gentle. Besides, if it did break, I would definitely purchase another without hesitation. We'll see what happens 6mos down the line though as one reviewer stated a true review comes after you've had the product long enough to see how it holds up over time. Another reviewer had a gripe about being shot with cold water & stated that although you have the hot water connection, you still end up shocked by the cold as in most households, you do have to wait for your water to heat up. I'm not sure which unit type this reviewer had as I'm suspicious that some of these reviews may even come from different models, but the one I have is the one with the nozzle cleaning feature. I figured out the smart way to go about getting your water at the right temperature prior to use & that was to simply run it in nozzle cleaning mode on the hot water setting 1st. It's not rocket science, but it's really no different from how you may let your water run in the tub for a few minutes to get the temp right before turning on the shower. Now if you don't already do this, then I'm happy to have schooled you on this new way of doing your daily routine....hopefully everyone here does bathe daily....I don't generally like to make assumptions.If you are seriously considering purchasing a bidet, I would recommend this one because of the easy install, easy controls, nozzle cleaning feature, & especially the additional hot water connection. I had to get this particular unit because the winters here get pretty frigid. Sure cold tap water in the winter is good for drinking, but not hitting you where the sun doesn't shine.....or well....isn't supposed to be shining. I don't judge.I gave this product 5 stars because it is exactly what I expected. I don't believe you can take away a star because the unit is plastic as you are well aware of that that prior to purchase. I didn't take any stars away due to the malfunction of the 1st unit either because it was easily & quickly replaced. All I can say is that it's pretty awesome now & 6mos from now, should I remember to do so, I'll leave another review on how this item is doing, good or bad.***I have made a new discovery, so this extra bit here is being added after my review above was already submitted. This applies to ladies only considering we have a little more to manage in our private area. I noticed that no one else has mentioned the fact that although there are only 3 settings for this bidet, you can actually use 2 of each of the settings simultaneously. Did anyone else discover this as well? Anyway, I'm not sure, but like I said, since it appears no one else has mentioned this in their reviews, I'm taking the liberty to mention it now. There are 2 separate nozzles that will come down depending which setting you have the unit on, wash or women. The wash setting is for the nozzle on the left & it's for both men & women of course because we all have an anus.....I hope. Now for the good part, the women setting applies to the nozzle on the right & it's clearly for the vaginal area. My discovery is this....should you turn your selection dial between settings, it will allow for both nozzles to come down simultaneously so that both the anus & vaginal area can be cleaned at once. I don't know if anyone else finds this cool or useful, but I love it and so just had to share that tidbit.Thanks for reading!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars How did I live without this?",
                "reviewText": "This bidet is not without its flaws... but I honestly don't know how I lived without it.Cons:1. The kit to install is really crappy. It comes with some useless plastic wrenches, plumbers tape that is so glued to itself that it is unusable and very poor instructions on installation. It was murder for me to try to get this thing installed, and when I couldn't get it to stop leaking (ruining a lot of stuff) I had to get a plumber to come help me. The PLUMBER even had a very long, hard time getting this thing to work, so if you know someone who does plumbing and has proper tools, do it. Don't try to do this yourself (unless you're a plumber).2. The under-seat design puts pressure (from your weight) on the inner fixtures. You have to shift your weight around to get 100% pressure. It's a mild nuisance, but not enough to stop using it.3. The seat/attachment area is not able to be 100% secured, which makes the seat slide around a bit... which might be by design, given #2 con.4. The controls should be a bit further from the seat. If you've got a big butt (slightly larger than average, about a US 2X) you're kind of sitting on the controls. It's not enough to be a problem for me, but if you're a US 3X or above girl you might want to look at another model where the controls are further from the seat5. After you purchase this thing, you will literally be APPALLED by the concept of NOT having it. You will no longer feel ok about pooing without it. You will become OUTRAGED about living in a country where bidets are not present in EVERY toilet you use. If you are in the US, you will probably start questioning living in this cesspool of filth where people are forced to poo without a bidet, ever. You will think that these should be in EVERY toilet EVERYWHERE and anything less is horrifying. Immigrating to a more civilized country, solely for the reason of bum cleanliness will sound completely reasonable.Pros:1. It works. You will be clean once you get the hang of this. After I did, I had to poo at work and felt completely disgusted by the fact that I couldn't wash like I did at home. I felt like an utter barbarian using TP instead of power-washing my hind end. This device will enable you to reach back and scratch an itch without having to worry about smelly, unsanitary hands afterwards. Your backside will be spotlessly clean every time. You will never again fear making a skid mark.2. It's not JUST a bidet/butt-wash... Whether by design, or not, it's also an enema/high colonic irrigator. I'm not joking. This is a SERIOUSLY LIFE CHANGING THING, at least for me. You know how sometimes you do your thing, but then, like five minutes later, you need to go do it again... sometimes as many as four to what feels like four thousand times in one day? This puts an end to all that s***, literally. if you have the pressure at 100% and tilt the right way, this will will rinse out what feels like your entire colon. I've experience this with either home enemas or colon hydrotherapy places... and this is a FAR better experience than either of those things. Unlike an enema, which is an annoyingly awkward process, this is super fast and easy. Unlike a colonic, this is not invasive or disturbing. You simply get in the right position and rinse everything out. SO CLEAN! This is a godsend if you're sick or ate something that didn't agree with you, or simply have a weird poo problem. Excellent!3. The temp is just right in the middle. The cold and hot water are even, making it pleasantly cool. I just leave that setting there.4. The settings are pretty much as described. I usually just leave it on \"clean\" to bum-wash and that's it. I almost never need to use the \"rinse\" setting, as it never gets anything on it. The \"female\" setting is similarly ignored most of the time. I'm past the era of my life where I really need THAT much of a clean in that area, but I wager that if you are still experiencing visits from your red headed Aunt Flow, or her little brown dog Spot, it would be helpful for flushing them out. I also suppose that if you have a male partner and need to let his \"emotions\" out occasionally, it would help with that as well. I guess what I'm saying is that men and postmenopausal lesbians will not have a use for that setting. I've had some folks ask me if it was any good for a \"shower massage\" type use, so I gave that a go and can say with confidence that is a very firm no on any possible \"massage\" capabilities. It simply does not work that way.5. It's not going to overflow your toilet. This was a concern for me. When I first started using it, I would flush before using it, worried that it might cause an overflow. This is not necessary. After even a long period of washing, the level in the bowl never got to any concerning level at all.6. If you have a fusion or a spinal problem that makes bum wiping painful/difficult, this is a godsend. Also, if you are a very tall person with long arms and legs and find yourself struggling in small cubicles, this also is helpful.7. You will save a TON of money on toilet paper. You will need ONE wipe to dry yourself, but that one wipe will be clean. It's reasonable to consider no TP at all if you are the only person using it. Do you wash your towels every time you use them? You could use a wash rag to dry with and not use TP at all, ever. I have not gone to this yet... so I can't say if that is preferable, but one wipe of the TP rather than more than one, is a huge improvement. It's also more environmentally friendly. You will also be able to eliminate wet wipes.In short, this is a life-changing purchase. It saves a ton of money and helps you be healthier and happier.",

As this Bidet is not built for Europe's toilets you need to cut through your existing toilet(not that hard though) and adjust the toilet seat to fit it.However once you arrive to do it, the result is really impressive. We have used it since every time instead of the classic toilet paper.When buying I had to consider heated vs not heated Bidet and decided to go for the heated one.If your setup allows, I cannot recommend enough the heated option. It's so much better during winter.I can recommend this to all my friends and family. Really good product once installed in place.",
