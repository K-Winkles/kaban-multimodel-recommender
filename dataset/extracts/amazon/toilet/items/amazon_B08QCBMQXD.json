I assumed it was the batteries but after replacing them, the feature still didn't work. I called the company and was told that the warranty is only 12 months. So now I have to purchase replacement parts for $70 since it wasn't covered. The representative said it should last many years but evidently it did not. Stay away from this item unless you want to replace parts every 14 months or so.",
