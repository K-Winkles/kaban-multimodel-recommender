I found this one with really good specs and a great all-in-one design, and I had to get one. I was not disappointed; this one has worked out great. First off, very easy to install. I like how it came with everything to install and some high-tech seal; this one will never leak. I just followed the easy-to-understand instructions step-by-step, and I had it installed in roughly 30 minutes. Secondly, it works great. I like how easy this one is to use. The instruction manual was very easy to understand, and I could use the toilet almost immediately. I also like how easily the remote control works and how I can easily understand features/options. I also like to tweak the positions of the sprayer, the temperature of the water, and the air for drying right from the remote control for both myself and my girl. I also like how comfortable the seat is, it is always just the right temperature to sit down, and the lighting makes it easy to find at night. Lastly, I love the self-cleaning mode. After a few days, my old toilet always got a ring, and I knew it was time for cleaning. This one never gets the ring and always looks great. No cons, it worked out great for me, and I am very happy with the purchase.",

It is both technologically advanced and environmentally sensitive, making it ideal for individuals looking to improve their lifestyle while saving the planet. It combines comfort and cutting-edge technology to provide a great option for personal hygiene.This toilet exceeds what I was expecting. There are many washing modes to choose from, depending on what you need. I don't think anything was forgotten. This bidet was simple to install, but it needs both power and water connections to be set up and run.I enjoy how the seat heats up to keep my bottom warm on a chilly morning. This is futuristic, but it works well. It doesn't look like a toilet at all because there is no back. I chose the one that allows you to manually open and close the lid, but there is also an option that does it automatically.Using this allows me to foster sustainability by reducing the amount of paper I use. It has a remote, but I can also set it up to control it using my smartphone, which I always carry with me. This takes me from the Stone Age to the present day. I'm in love with this toilet, which is something I never expected to say. It's a little pricey, but it's well worth it, and guests usually ask where I got it.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. First of all, this is overall a great toilet/bidet function. Pros:1. Both the toilet and the remote control look so sleek and modern.2. Fairly easy to install (note: will need to drill into floor, mine was a concrete slab so be prepare to get the tools to do that).3. Strong flushing suction4. Alot of adjustable temperature options for personalized comfort5. Seat is in great form and long time sitting on the toilet did not leave my legs falling asleep like my old standard toilet which is a huge pro in my book.Cons:1. The seating is plastic and may scratches easily so use soft material to clean. So if you use tough paper towels be prepare for it to scratch and loses its luster.2. Self cleaning mode doesn\u2019t seem to work as intended\u2026because water seems to be concentrated to the left of the spray head and not the entire thing when it is out. Maybe during the retracting phase it may clean more, but from the initial look of it, I don\u2019t think the self cleaning function is working well. But overall everything looks clean so I\u2019m not overly worried.3. Although it does UV sanitizing after every flush/use, it does not have sanitization button on the remote so there is no option to UV sanitize for a long time.4. Has two hole/gaps at the base of the cover to which splash back could enter which is going to be hard to clean (I\u2019m not looking forward to that. Couple of cleaning options one is to clean with a cleaning agent but with a Qtip and the second option is to use sanitizing spray into the gaps but I don\u2019t know how the metal part will hold up to the cleaning agents.Overall, it is a nice toilet, I just see the potential wear and tear of the toilet seating area which I see as irreversible since it doesn\u2019t look like it can be replaced easily without removing the whole toilet. But overall, for the first week of owning both the sensor automatic lid closing and non-automatic lid closing, I am happy with the product. Will update this review after 6 months to a year or so if anything changes for the worst. But so far so good!",

The remote is very easy to use and allows you to customize the function settings. Ours has the self flush/clean which works great and keeps it very clean.",

We noticed the plastic filter seems to have been used but we wanted to install this anyway because we wanted to use it. The failure is at the connection from the plastic filter to the 3/8 hose I believe that the size. But this hose and the filter are both parts of this toilet. I trust my plumber and this is a very easy connection. So it must be the used/faulty part.I would have given this at least 4 stars but then this is unusable now and I cannot find a replacement part in Home Depot.I need this fixed ASAP. How can that be done?",
