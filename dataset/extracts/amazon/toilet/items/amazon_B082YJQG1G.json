Initially found out about this from a family members positive experience. Ordered this and it showed up the next day, super-fast delivery. Was excited to get it installed and it went in with relative ease. It has so many features, especially the no hands sensors, pretty cool, until now I had no clue I needed that, but so far so good.I have been very impressed and wish I would have purchased this toilet much sooner. By behind has never been this happier!!!",

It does everything just right, however, the initial software set-up is complex and I have yet to get the seat and cover to open automatically upon approach, even though it appears to be programmed for that. The foot-activated open is a reliable hands-free solution. Auto-close and flushing are great.Not recommended as a guest toilet, however, because your guests will be confused and startled by the automatic functions.",

It has different spray features that make it easy to get clean without needing to use toilet paper, and it has built in dryer that works great.We love that it has sensors that lift the lid and seat, so you never have to touch anything. We also love that it automatically flushes, which is fantastic with kids, since they seem to always forget to flush. The heated seat is also a great feature, especially in the winter time. It has a blue night light which is so convenient for trips to the bathroom in the middle of the night.We would definitely recommend this toilet to anyone. We are so glad we bought it. The only down side is it is hard when you go on vacation and have to use a regular toilet!",

They totally skip over setting up the two user functions.I like the way it works and have been impressed until the month and a half point when the lid stopped opening completely. Now it only goes up three quarters of the way and if you don't quickly push it up the rest of the way it starts coming down. Definitely too early to be having issues like that.9 months in it is leaking at the lower filter area. Going to need to get a plumber out. Also there is a white large piece above the filter that is now squirting a quick jet of water out when the toilet is flushed. Hopefully I can find someone who can service this product or we go back to a traditional toilet that works forever.",

                "reviewText": "I waited quite a while to review this, as I really wasn't sure how I felt overall. First impressions were absolute love, I've never experienced the luxury a toilet like this offers, nor have most people, and as such it's easy to look at it as being superfluous. After getting used to it for a while though, I'd say it's probably worth every penny.. so far. My concern is longevity and customer support once it does wear out..Before buying this, I first tried contacting the manufacturer themselves (Trone) and was unable to get ANY kind of response - email, phone calls, nothing. The only response I got was from plumberstock.com customer support, who knew very little about the actual product, and I doubt would be the ones to actually warranty out the product if it failed.. Doesn't exactly give me a warm fuzzy feeling if something breaks... And there are a lot of little things that could go wrong with a product like this, two motors for each half of the lid, solenoid valves to control the water flow, not to mention the computer board that controls the whole thing.. none of which your local repair shop is going to want to try and touch.Functionality wise, the motion sensor is a blessing and a curse. My toilet room also happens to be my shower room, so experience the lid opening probably 3 times each time I shower. Little irritating, not a big deal, again, I just worry what happens when that little tiny motor wears out..About 4 months in, the chrome finish on the levers that the toilet lid and seat are attached to, originally chrome, have now started rusting.On the upside of things, the toilet looks absolutely beautiful. It has a recessed hole in the back, which, if you can replumb the cold water inlet, can be entirely hidden behind the toilet. This required cutting out the drywall, cutting the old copper pipe out and rerouting it a few inches sideways using new copper. It was a real pain, but the end result looks amazing!The heated seat is one of my favorite features. I didn't think I'd use it as a bidet much, but it really helps and cuts down on toilet paper usage - up to 100% if you are willing to wait for it to dry you.I think the photo says the rest.",

                "reviewText": "I used to think that all toilets were created equal, until now. This product has more features than the Toto Neorest and comes at a fraction of the cost. If you are looking to purchase a bidet toilet with all the bells and whistles, then this is your toilet. I have been super impressed by the quality and feel of the toilet, controller and all of its functions. The controller is intuitive and easy to use. My only regret is that I waited too long to purchase a high level toilet and would not look at any other product than Trone. I had some questions about the product and the Trone customer service team was friendly and extremely helpful and took great care of me.",
