When you press the pedal to the floor it gives a great cleansing flush. After flushing it refiles to the proper level itself.

I bought this after trying to fix my old toilet witch i did fix intill the same part i replaced started leaking again. So after that i decided to just replace the whole toilet since i had the short toilet in my camper any way. I like how quit it flushes and i also like the slow closing toilet seat. It was real easy to install the only thing i had to change was my routeing for my water line. But if your think of upgrading i would recommend doing so.",

I did have to turn the mounting floor flange 90 degrees but it wasn't hard to install. It took some time to get the water connected without leaks. The problem is there is no room to work in the Airstream.It fit without any problems. I do wish it had a sprayer. It is much easier to clean than the plastic toilet and flushes much better.",

This purchase made everything efficient, easy, matched the bathroom and saved me some money! It was $100 less then the local RV store.Good buy! Hopefully this review doesn't jinx it!",
