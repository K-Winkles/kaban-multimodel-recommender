I got the bowl first, with no indication the tank was arriving separately, so that caused some confusion. The toilet looks nice, but the bowl is quite long, particularly the rear end that holds the toilet tank. It juts out so much that it didn't fit over my existing drain hole! The difference is around 4\" compared to the other brand. I was shocked it could vary that much; this one would had to be cut into the baseboard to fit. Had to return it.",

Flushed well but not much clearing around drain. The bowl is a bit flatter near the bottom and requires more frequent cleaning. It\u2019s livable but not ideal.",

This kohler toilet is briliant its converted me id only ever buy a kohler toilet from now on. Id highly recommend this toilet it has alot better flush and a big water mass in the bowl which i think is more hygienic than our british/European toilets",
