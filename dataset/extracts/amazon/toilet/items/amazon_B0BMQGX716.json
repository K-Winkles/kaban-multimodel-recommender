                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was actually expecting some sort of malleable plastic but I am surprised about the material iban very good way, it feels strong as it it were copper. Looks very minimalistic and fancy and it was extremely easy to install. I am grateful that it had both, the \u201chang from toilet\u201d and \u201c attach to wall\u201d options because my toilet did not allow the hang up modality. Provides very good water pressure and you can actually control it by the pressure you apply to the little pry. I am very pleased and certainly works better than the previous model I had, which was the one attached to the toilet seat, that kind ultimately damaged my seat hinges and I was forced to buy a new one. Will but it in the future for the guest bathroom.",

                "reviewText": "So, my family returned from Thailand and this was the first Amazon purchase my husband made. We had to have the \u201cbutt sprayers\u201d that you must use while living in Thailand. I will say these cut down on the toilet paper usage as you begin with a clean (or cleaner depending on how well your aim is) surface. Super easy to install. No need for anything special and it comes with a little mounting handle that goes right over the back tank under the lid. They\u2019re clean and we have had guests use them! They are also discreet and we have had others not even notice them. I\u2019ve never liked the other style bidet systems as it feels like they are just dirty and when I have gone to someone\u2019s home I wonder how well they clean this extra remote thing attached to their toilet. These aren\u2019t like that at all. Go for this style \u201cbutt sprayer\u201d you won\u2019t regret it!",
