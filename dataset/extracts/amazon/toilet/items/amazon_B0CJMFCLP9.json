                "reviewText": "I won't get on my TP box and preach why cleaning with a bidet is better than using paper. That said, the new, black handheld bidet kit performs about the same as my previous silver-color one, but adds a bit of class.The black color is strikingly beautiful with its satiny finish.The kit consists of a spray head, delivery hose, a valve and various washers and fittings, instructions with drawings, and a wall holder that, thankfully, can be hung on the toilet tank. The kit is very complete, even containing a small roll of tape to seal the threads.To use, one would first turn on the valve installed under the toilet tank. Then, while aiming at the desired area, carefully pull back the lever, controlling the pressure as needed. When finished, turn off the valve and relieve the pressure in the hose by briefly operating the sprayer lever.Pros:-attractive black satin finish.-flexible hose with a protective metal sheath (sorry cats!).-complete kit with the necessary washers, etc.Cons:-nozzle head could be smoother.Opinion:I far and away prefer the handheld type of bidet over the toilet seat affair. This kit fills the need handsomely. Most people will find it easy to install. Just remember to shut off the water to the hose and sprayer head when finished using, AND relieve the pressure in the hose.",

                "reviewText": "After about four months of regular use, this flimsy unit failed and flooded my home. It has been used about once a day since I installed it. It randomly failed while I wasn\u2019t even home. I used it in the morning, left for work several hours later and it started leaking badly while I was gone. It failed at the hose/handle junction after it had been sitting idle for several hours. I came home to a flooded bathroom and bedroom. The leaking spray was so strong that it blew a hole in the sheetrock behind the toilet.It seemed rather flimsy when I installed it. Turns out it is not well made, failed with average to light use and caused a bad flood in my home. I would NOT recommend this product. I would recommend spending a little more money for a better quality product. This one is junk!",
