                "reviewText": "Just finished installing this bidet attachment. A couple of tips come to mind, tape al your fittings before you start installing them. It just makes it easier as some spaces get a little tight once installed. I did have to buy an 8\" braided flexible toilet inlet hose since the one already there was a fixed tube. There was no way of fitting the T adapter into the mix. Nice that the adapter is all metal and has some beefy washers. A lot of these kits I see only come with plastic T adapters. Also worth noting, this doesn't come with teflon tape. So if you don't happen to have some kicking around, you should order a roll. Luckily I had some left over from a product that was generous enough to include some. Power wise is good. I was afraid the sudden hit of cold water down there was going to a shock but not bad. Glad I didn't do a more complex install for a heated version. No leaking after it's maiden voyage. Hopefully everything holds up. I also like the control setup since the default back lever position is the clean position so if someone accidently turns on the front lever (which is on/off) it just sprays downward and not out. So always remember to put the back lever in the flat position when finished doing your business.",

                "reviewText": "I hesitated about giving this 3 or 4 stars. It isn't bad, but at the same time it isn't great. For a bidet, you want something that is comfortable so you can use it regularly. This particular bidet works, but has some shortcomings that make it hard to recommend.The first shortcoming (in my opinion) is that it comes in two parts. The second hole that you secure it with connects to the larger body like a puzzle piece. I don't understand why this was done. It would have been better as a single piece. It works and shouldn't fall apart due to pressure, but it still seems unnecessary and any additional potential point of failure in a product is not great.The product comes with almost everything you need to install it. The one thing missing is plumbers tape. Some may argue you don't need it, but I would highly recommend it to prevent leaks. Luckily I had some already so this is mostly an FYI.The main issue I have is with the controls. It is a little hard to understand the tilt style controls and what exactly each thing does. The front control seems to handle water pressure strength, but when slowly moving it stronger it went from trickling down into the bowl with no contact to suddenly firehosing up at me. I tested this many times and the difference between those two steps in the switch is drastic. It might be due to the water pressure in my home, but I have other Bidets and they don't have the same issue.Overall, this thing is not bad, but it could be better. For the price, if you're looking for a cheap bidet for a spare bathroom then it works. However, I don't know if I'd recommend it for a regularly used toilet or a guest toilet. You might be better off paying slightly more for something with better control over the water pressure.",

                "reviewText": "This bidet is easy to install and comes with everything you'll need to put it in, unless you want to use teflon tape. This Bidet has unusual handles that rotate to activate the flow of water and the intensity of the jets. The controls stick out a bit from the side of the toilet so you'll want to make sure there is enough space to install the attachment. The entire attachment is pretty flimsy and I wouldn;t want this in a high traffic bathroom. Four stars.",

                "reviewText": "Where has this been all my life??? After traveling overseas, we became more and more appreciative of bidets. Initially we wanted a handheld bidet but this intrigued me. It was easy to install as I managed to do it myself where I would usually ask my husband to take care of these kind of things. Once connected, that was it. My life changed forever. We used to use a manual bidet, which you had to put water in and would squeeze. With this there was no more of that and just straight up convenience.The pressure is adjustable and gets pretty strong on the highest setting. I do find that I kind of have to scoot around a little bit sometimes to get it where it needs to go, but I don't mind one bit. My little ones have also gotten accustomed to using it and life has never been better as a mother. I highly recommend this product, get it and change your life too!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. So we got an add on bidet for the primary bathroom and after a week I loved it so much I wanted one for the basement bathroom. This was a great option and I like it even more than the first one we got (you can search my reviews to find.PROS:-It took five minutes to install with a basic wrench. True, I had done a similar one just a month before, but it really is simple to install and had good instructions.-I like the levers instead of turning a knobs to control the flow.-This model has a sleeker more refined look to it than most of the models I considered.-does the job in getting you clean two different ways.CONS:-Doesn\u2019t come with the baby roll of Teflon plumber tape, but I had extra of my own.If you\u2019ve never used a bidet, this is an inexpensive way to try it out and feel how clean you can be. I honestly think it will pay for itself in a year as you use less a lot less toilet paper (why has the price not come down after Covid?) and get cleaner with the bidet.",
