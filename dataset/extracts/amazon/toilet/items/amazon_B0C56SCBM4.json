Once I took the unit out of the box I oxiodnsee the quality in design. I also happened to purchase a new toilet seat as well just to make it all feel new.Installation was easy. At first I didn't realize how tight everything needed to be since I had a small leak. Once I really got the nuts and the valves properly adjusted it worked like a charm.The water pressure is adjustable which is great for those who want to figure out their most comfortable setting and the buttons are fostty easy to understand and use. If you can note by looking at the piece that goes in the toilet and the switch board, it's very minimalist in design.No power needed and the anesthetic is very nice. I would say that this product is certainly worth a try especially foe the price point. Leaves you feeling clean and you actually save a bit more toilet paper in the long run.",

I'm a guy so I can't review the feminine sprayer function lol but the derriere bottom sprayer is top notch plus you can adjust the spray power with the +/- scroll on the side, from a light spray to a pretty powerful one, I set it to probably a 4 out of 10 on the spray level. Makes sense why it has such a high rating, 10/10 would recommend",

Installation was a breeze, taking me only a few minutes with the clear instructions provided. The bidet offers a refreshing and hygienic cleansing experience, making me wonder how I ever lived without it.The adjustable water pressure settings allow for a customized and comfortable cleanse. The nozzle positioning is precise, ensuring accurate targeting and minimal mess. Plus, the self-cleaning feature is a real time-saver.Not only has this bidet attachment improved my personal hygiene, but it has also helped reduce toilet paper waste, making it an eco-friendly choice. It's a small investment for a significant upgrade in comfort and cleanliness. I highly recommend this bidet attachment to anyone looking to enhance their bathroom experience.",

                "reviewText": "Yup, now you can own your very own appliance once reserved for royalty and found in many upscale restaurants and hotels. I installed this bidet on my toilet and connected the supply lines within 20 minutes. As for functionality, there are basically only three modes of operation, feminine wash, posterior wash (as the name implies, a shower for your butt), and nozzle cleaning mode that flushes the lines and cleans the nozzles. Especially useful after a bad night at Taco Bell and you leave a mess in the bowl the next morning..There is also a pressure dial on the side of the control panel to adjust the amount of pressure output of the nozzles for all modes of operation. Set and forget to your comfort level, and adjustable for the comfort levels for your family members. Just a word of caution is in order. Unless you want a high pressure enema, I'd suggest not putting it set to MAX.The push button control panel is within easy reach and very intuitive. Enjoy that luxury only reserved for royalty and the rich with the simple push of a button, at a very affordable price.Hey guys! Want a tip? Just because the button says \"feminine wash\" on the controls (using icons for identification), just give that button a push anyways! No guts, no glory. Just like Charley did in the Wonkavator when Willy Wonka told him to push that red button because Wonka never did. You will certainly be in for a treat! LOLOverall, it is a very decent hygienic appliance that is super easy to install, affordable, and would make a great gift to give to your elderly friends or family members. Put one under the tree this Christmas. The receiver will love it. They got enough flat screen TVs anyways. Instead of giving them the gift of eye candy this year, give them the gift of butt candy. It makes going to the bathroom fun again.",
