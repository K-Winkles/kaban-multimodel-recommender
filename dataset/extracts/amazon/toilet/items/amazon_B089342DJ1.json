Just get good Adhesive tape (the thicker ones), put that on it and you can cut/trim it to the shape of the risers.",

                "reviewText": "I received this yesterday and immediately installed it. If you have a bidet with plastic toilet seat, you must have this item. The plastic seat will flex due to the bidet with at least half inch higher. As with all adhesive tapes, you must clean the surface with alcohol and let dry before application. You can also increase the height of the bumper if necessary. I highly recommend this seat bumper to all the Luxe bidet owners.",
