                "reviewText": "I've had this for a few months now and it still works great!INSTALLATION: Most people should be able to install this easily, however I don't have any experience with this type of thing. Be very careful that you install the nut with the threads facing the proper way; I stripped them easily which caused a leak that rendered my whole toilet unusable and caused a lot of frustration. Once I replaced the nut and got some help, it was great!PRESSURE/FLOW: The pressure adjustment is not super sensitive like some bidets so you have a wide range between a soft flow and a harder flow. I've used some bidets where a millimeter makes the difference between a comfortable or painful flow, but this one is not like that.USE/INTERFACE: I really like the handle twist operation. It's simple to navigate for new users or children/elderly, very straightforward. It makes for a clean, attractive design. This also did not bulk up my toilet seat so I didn't need risers for the front half of it like some models require. It's unnoticeable!FEMININE WASH: It's very convenient having the feminine wash, specifically after working out or during my time of the month. Even if you are a man, if you have a woman in your life, she will appreciate having this available and feel more comfortable because of it. Having that option for this price is amazing.CONS: I didn't want to get a warm water bidet because of the price and I figured that might be even more difficult for me to install, but sometimes I do wish I had the option. However, that's not the product's fault but just remember this does not have a warm option.In conclusion, for the price, it really is an excellent product. It's honestly life-changing to have a bidet and I recommend them to everyone. You will feel cleaner, clean yourself faster, and save money on toilet paper. If it had a drying function, I would no longer buy toilet paper at all (those styles are quite an investment, however). This is a major improvement in my life as-is. As mentioned, the price is truly unbeatable for the product you're receiving. I was prepared to pay double for what I considered an \"inexpensive\" type and I'm so glad I found this. You will not be disappointed.",

                "reviewText": "I sighted bidets frequently while traveling Europe decades ago. My young, naive perspective at the time merely considered it an exclusive domain of the female gender.Years later it found its way to American residential toilets in various forms that include a simple attachment such as this Samodra brand that is of eloquently simple design and reliable function. Installation was relatively easy with care to secure the hoses and align the nozzle. In use, targeting the anus with its stream provides a most thorough cleansing. One may need to scooch around the seat for optimum alignment. TMI?This and some other bidet attachment brands offer a version for the female anatomy, replacing the \u201cnozzle-cleansing downwash\" with an alternative stream.A LUXE Bidet 4 piece Universal Toilet Seat Bumper Kit (sold on Amazon) will level the seat to accommodate the attachment.This Samodra bidet performs very well, offering myriad benefits I note here: 1. Eliminates toilet paper 2. Saves sewer or septic system 3. Cleans thoroughly 4. Provides hands-free hygieneShower your heinie clean with a bidet, and walk away fresh every time. Oh, and never again buy another roll of toilet paper.",

                "reviewText": "My husband and I watch a lot of YouTube...a lot of YouTube. One of our favorite channels has been sponsored by Hello Tushy off and on for a while now and it got my husband thinking that he might like to try a bidet. Since Hello Tushy is EXPENSIVE (and we are broke millennials), we decided to try something cheaper. I am EXTRMELY pleased with this bidet! I honestly didn't think I'd like this weird contraption - why would I want water shooting up my butt? What if it missed? How was I supposed to get clean? But little did I know that these were all just baseless fears - probably encouraged by \"Big TP\", the toilet paper industry that wants to continue to get more of my hard earned money!When we got the bidet, we found out that it was very easy to install. Full disclosure - we did end up having to go to the hardware to get a new supply line hose because the rubber gasket on the old one basically disintegrated as soon as we unscrewed it to add the bidet line. So, it cost us $2.99 plus tax extra plus a trip to the hardware store. But I don't blame the bidet for that - blame a toilet that has probably been in the house since 1978. (Hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it!) So, not including the trip to the hardware store, it probably took us 20 minutes or so to install.I absolutely love how slim this design is - I've seen other bidets that require a toilet seat lift or something like that, and this one does not require any extra hardware.The water pressure is also great - not too rough, but definitely enough to make you feel clean! Also, full disclosure - when we installed it, we wanted to see how it worked, so my husband sent me out in the hall FAR AWAY from the toilet so I could watch him turn it on. I still got sprayed in the face from probably 5-7 feet away. He did have it on full blast, and he did apologize...but there was much laughter and hilarity that ensued. Thank goodness it was clean supply water and not toilet water!Anyway, since we have installed this bidet, neither of us will use another toilet to do our business! Forget family holiday gatherings now - everyone is coming to our house for Christmas because my husband doesn't want to use his parents' toilet any more! I also think I've convinced my brother to buy one for himself. (Guess there is another family we can safely visit for holidays now though.)Do yourself and the planet a favor and get this bidet! It is a great model, easy to install, and will save you a ton of money on toilet paper! I will never go back!",

                "reviewText": "After a trip to Japan I came home an immediately installed three cold-water bidet attachments on my toilets. I bought two different brands, including this one. Both were good, but I greatly prefer this one.I absolutely love the very streamlined controls. (The other brand I bought, had two dial knobs). It's just a simple twist of the wrist, and you get a stream to the front; twist the other way, and you get a stream that is more toward the back.Because there are no knobs and its so sleek in design, cleaning it is really easy and it can remain hygienic. Remember this sits next to your toilet bowl so I wanted something that is easy to clean in case of pee splashes.Installation was very simple, the instructions were clear and it came with everything including the plumber's tape and a template. The profile of the unit is very slim, so it fit under my existing toilet with no problem. I've had it now for 6 months, have used it literally daily, and it does not leak whatsoever.Highly recommended, especially for the price.",
