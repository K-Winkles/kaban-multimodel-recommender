Pressure is good, obviously can be adjusted. Many recommend turning it off after use, been using those things my entire life and never did, but I keep it set about a quarter to half way open so its not pumping max all time, no real need for that anyway. It helps if you want to rinse the tub, tiles if you don't have a hose connected shower head. Though, these don't last forever. A year, two and expect to have leaks when spraying. I think its due to corrosion from the water and all, normal.",

                "reviewText": "We were happy with the product at first (we actually had two ordered for both our bathrooms). However, we had three random leaks from the head (sprayer part) that if we had not caught them early , would have turned into serious flooding accidents. After disassembling the head, I learned the design is flawed. The only part keeping the sprayer valve closed so preventing water from leaking is a loaded spring that after a while and normal wearing is no longer able to keep the valve closed. On the other side, the only part keeping the sprayer button in place is a a thicker rubber washer that also can fail after some time. So the design is guaranteed to fail at the head and cause leaking sooner or later. Just a matter of time and luck....",

It is very easy to attach to your toilet and has a pretty long hose so we used it to spray out our bathtub anytime babies had accidents in the tub or we had to wash the dog. Needless to say this sprayer got a lot of use. That\u2019s probably why it only lasted 2.5 year, which for $25 is pretty awesome. The hose began to leak and is leaving pools of water on our bathroom floor. Other than that it was great, just ordered a brand new one.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. It's actually a really great bidet and now that I've gotten used to it I do like the power it does offer. I have a lot of animals in my house so sometimes I'll put something over the toilet and spray it out with the bidet sprayer also the bidet sprayer doesn't have an aerator on it so it sprays out faster than any other sink in my house that has a restricted aerator.I will say there is a point where it seems to just go from slowly increasing pressure and water pressure to all the sudden it's pretty much full blast. I did include a video where you can see that kind of tipping point area while you're pressing on the lever.Also during winter it's still freezing cold water has this is just cold water there are some heat tapes that you could probably put around the base or along the water line. But I've gotten used to it it's really not that big of a deal but the first time you spray yourself with a cold full blast oh yeah it'll make you regret ever installing this \ud83e\udd23Still it saved me a ton on toilet paper many people may still use toilet paper to just dab themselves dry I literally just sit on the toilet a little bit longer and started pulling my pants up even with me being a little water wet. It doesn't cause any adverse effects no rashes no yeast infection or anything. As you've actually cleaned yourself off! I have not had this for over a month and feel confident giving it five stars though I do wish there was maybe some dial somewhere that I could adjust the max pressure.",

We got the replacement the very next day. Both sprayers worked well and we were glad we made the purchase. Then (a couple months later), the hose in our master bathroom broke. My youngest son came running in the kitchen telling me there was water coming out of our toilet. I ran to our bathroom and water was just spraying out of the T-valve where the hose broke off. It wasn't just spilling out, it was spraying out like a pressure washer! I'm not sure how the hose broke-off from the T-valve, but I'm glad my youngest son heard the noise and told me early enough before it really flooded our bathroom. I wish I had taken a picture of the hose and valve. I was so upset having to clean up our bathroom I just tossed this stuff in the trash. So that's 2 out of 3 sprayers we received that was poorly made. I'm giving it 3 stars because we really enjoyed having it when it worked for us. We ended up buying a bio-bidet from Costco and I definitely prefer this one so we bought another one to replace the other sprayer that's currently working.",
