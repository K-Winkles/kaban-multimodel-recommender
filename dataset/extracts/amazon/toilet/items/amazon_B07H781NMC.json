                "reviewText": "Without hesitation I will recommend this toilet to anyone in the market for a new toilet. It\u2019s beautiful, comfortable, and affordable at $269.99 with free shipping. The elongated bowl gives you a bit more reach around room than the round bowl toilet does. It has two flush options, one slightly more powerful than other. I\u2019m guessing one is for liquids and the other for more solid waste. It flushes great and it\u2019s quiet in comparison to others I\u2019ve had. One push of the button takes care of any situation I\u2019ve come across. It has a 1.6 gallon flush capacity, so it leaves nothing lingering in the bowl. It sits up tall, (19.5\u201d) which is definitely a plus considering my elderly mother lives with me and the toilet we previously had was old and very low to the ground making it difficult for her get up off of. She has had no problem what so ever on this one. It comes with a seat! This was a deciding factor because I never knew some toilets are sold without seats until I started shopping for this one. The Woodbridge T-0019 comes with... not just any seat, but a soft touch, ultra quiet closing seat. You\u2019re kids cannot slam it and will not fall down unexpectedly. Originally I had ordered two identical toilets but one arrived broken so I had to return it. What a hassle, right? Absolutely not! It was virtually painless. It took all of 30 seconds to submit the return request. They promptly sent another toilet and picked up my return without any issue and all free of charge! Of course I did not install it myself so I had no problem with installation at all but the guys who did install it mentioned it was slightly more difficult to install because the bolts are hidden behind the sleek base design. Every other toilet I\u2019ve owned had nooks and crannies between the seat and base where dust collects but not this one. This design makes it easy to clean as well as being easy on the eyes. The toilet developed a slight rock after a week or so of use, however, a little caulk fixed it up and it hasn\u2019t happened since. My second one arrived this week without incident. This one was much easier for the guys to install because they had just done one and knew how to approach the hidden bolts holding the base to the floor. So far there is no rocking on second toilet. I would definitely buy this Woodbridge -0019 toilet again and I would highly recommend this toilet to anyone in the market for an above average bathroom experience!",

                "reviewText": "Fifth EDIT 7/25/23 still loving the toilet as before (four years now). The problem we are now facing is the toilet seat. The bolts have loosened and the toilet seat is sliding all over the place. And you can only access the bolts from this five inch opening in the back and our arms can not reach up there. In fact, I think it\u2019s impossible without removing toilet from the floor (which will be a task in itself). We\u2019d have to call a plumber to do that, and the one who installed it in 2019 said it was the hardest toilet he ever installed. So we are thinking of ordering a different toilet. Ugh. We love the looks of this toilet and how it functions. If you can afford to have someone remove/reinstall toilet to tighten the seat bolts every three or four years, then you will love this toilet.Fourth EDIT 2/17/22. Still loving it! Especially the ease in cleaning the outside. Our Kohler toilet upstairs without the skirt like this one, collects dust as we are so familiar with (toilet paper dust I think). So nice not to have to deal with that anymore with this toilet. I just read a review that complained of a weak flush; that isn\u2019t the case for us at all. That complaint surprised me. In fact, still never needing our plunger, lol. Here to order second Woodbridge, same model (our second remodeling project had been delayed).Third EDIT 7/2021. 23 months. No change, still love it. Ordering a second one.Second EDIT 3/2021. 19 months. No change\u2014 still love it. No clogs, no problems at all. Love to see there are now 1000+ reviews.EDIT: still 5-stars. it\u2019s now been ten months and still loving this toilet. No clogs. (BuzzFeed had an article that listed things you should buy for your home. One item was a sleek holder/efficient toilet bowl plunger. I immediately thought, Wow, that looks sharp! ... but wait, we don\u2019t need one anymore! Lol) Our upstairs bathroom remodel has been put on hold due to COVID, but we still plan to install this same model when the project gets rescheduled. Many things to love about it, but especially love the smooth skirt \u2014 stays so clean; no where for dust to collect! I also like that the tank lid is small with a slight forward tilt (plus it holds flush mechanism) Looks so much better clear of the clutter we used to store on the back of our old toilet. Con: depending on the \"situation\", on occasion, we find the toilet flush water doesn\u2019t clean the bowl as well as we might wish. But this isn\u2019t a deal breaker, and is far out-weighed by everything else we love about it. If offered a free toilet, with free install, one that had a turbo swirling flush that covered every square inch of the bowl, to replace this Woodbridge, we both would say, \u201cthanks but no thanks.\u201dOriginal post: Thankful to the other reviewers who helped us decide to order this toilet sight unseen. Ordering an \u201cappliance\u201d without personal recommendations, or reviewed in Consumer Reports, etc., etc. \u2014 it's just not my nature. I guess same goes for toilets, or anything nearly $300. We've had it installed since mid August 2019. While two months isn\u2019t a long time, I will definitely update if my opinion changes. We've had no problems. It flushes great. It looks wonderful. This went into our first floor powder room. It\u2019s a bathroom the two of us use the most often. Early next year we are remodeling our only other bathroom, the full bath upstairs. We are definitely ordering another Woodbridge! Our remodeler who installed this toilet in August had no problems with the install. For someone installing this themselves as a homeowner, definitely read all of the question/answers and reviews for some great hints to help with the process.",

                "reviewText": "We had two leaky toilets in my new house and I was sick of having water issues, so this was the last part of a big bathroom renovation. I was a bit wary ordering from a brand I had never heard of (unlike Kohler, American Standard, or Toto) but I decided to bit the bullet because of the good reviews. I'm glad I did. This toilet is stylish, comfortable, and seems to function quite well. I'm really satisfied with my purchase. The only thing I didn't like was the challenge of the install, especially with how narrow my space is. My plumber actually rage quit on the install after trying for an hour, but that says more about him than it does about the toilet, really. After he quit, my brother and I had a go at the install, after a bit we figured out a method to seeing the bolts as we dropped the toilet down, and ensuring we got it right on the first drop. We also were able to tighten the bolts without much issue.PRO INSTALL TIPS: 1. MAKE SURE YOUR FLANGE BOLTS CANNOT ROTATE or WIGGLE. USE A TOP AND BOTTOM NUT FOR THE BOLT. 2. Put a camera (on a video/facetime call) in the very back of the wall looking at the flange & have another phone on that same video call to watch as the toilet goes down (to see the bolts). 3, Put a headlamp back there as well 4. With a partner, after putting the wax ring on, lean the toilet on it's front side, then lean the toilet back, watching the video to ensure both bolts line up and go through their holes, then drop the toilet down. 5. Tighten! Success!",
