Surprisingly, while the old Toto washlet had a filter screen to trap sediment from the water line, the new one does not. So, I purchased this. It is a very easy install. It has a decent size filter. The screen is the right size. It will eliminate sediment, but it is not so fine that it will clog easily. I actually installed this on the inlet water line so that both the toilet and washlet water will be filtered. I am guessing that cleaning it about once a year will be about right.",

                "reviewText": "In my house I have galvanized metal pipes that spit out debris into the water flow on a regular basis. After every main line shut off there was a risk to have some valves dead. Recently, there was a work done on the pipes, and all valves in the hose gone dead. I replaced them, but as the work continued two new died pretty quick. This filter was a lifesaver. Very easy to install (2 mins at max). Simple in maintenance: just unscrew (no tools needed), wash, and place back.Also, I have to say I was a bit skeptical about the filter design. However, practice proved the solution was right: as the debris accumulate, it gathers at the filter perimeter. This way the debris doesn't block the direct flow. Of course, you need to keep the process under control and do a periodical cleanup. Otherwise, the filter will get clogged eventually.On the photo is a demonstration of how much debris this filter can caught without getting clogged. I had a main line works in the house. Imagine what would happen to the valves if I didn't have the filter.",

You can reverse the inline filter mesh.We has a soft water system break and it spilled 2 million micro-resin balls in my plumbing... :(I have been unclogging showerheads, faucets and toilets for weeks.Toilets are a little more complicated to clean up, it either plugs up or never stops dribbling water overfilling the tank and you have to fully disassemble to clean them up.These inline filters are well made and the stainless mesh is a fine grade.It screws inline with your water inlet as a perfect match.\u25ba Pro-Tip: If you attach a flex hose to your toilet water inlet, the filter can be pointed downwards as it usually comes.... but if you use a hard / flexible metal tubing, you can reverse the filter and point it upwards so the filter goes inside you toilet valve riser with room to spare.... filter effect is the same but it leaves more room for the hard tube water inlet to go in from the bottom and not touch the filter.This will solve my micro-brad resin issue once and for all... and even if it packs itself solid of debris, it is easier to clean up that disassemble the toilet fill valve daily.",
