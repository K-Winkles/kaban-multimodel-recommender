                "reviewText": "I bought a second unit the very day I installed the first -- the dual nozzle version. Typically I like to test a product for a while before buying a second of anything. But I instantly loved the quality and performance. That's how impressed I was with the Brondell Bidet.Before purchase, I had narrowed it down to the Luxe Neo 180 and this model with my criteria being as follows:- Front wash: I think the front wash is especially beneficial for women. I love how fresh this makes me feel. I am pretty meticulous about my feminine hygiene and like to use wet wipes; this bidet eliminates that need, reducing waste and cost. Flushable wipes are too hard to find too. Without being too detailed, this is a great way to cleanse during my period and post-intercourse, and every single other time I go. If you're worried about going against the \"front to back\" convention, don't be. The aim is pretty true!- Variable pressure: I love how responsive the control is; twist a tiny bit to get the flow going and rinse the nozzle before it even touches your bum; open the valve a little more for a gentle wash; then as much as needed to power wash. It's a nice easy start, no shocking blast which is great for those who are sensitive. I preferred this over the stepped dials that clicked from set pressure to set pressure with no smooth transition in between. The pressure delivered is directly proportional to the effort you put in the twist of the knob -- totally intuitive.- Easy to use: my 9 year old son loves the one we installed in the kids' bathroom (my 13 year old son is still too afraid of it because he enthusiastically tested the first unit without sitting and saw it shoot across the room). Master 9 is fairly meticulous too and his bum used to eat through toilet paper to the point where it would plug up the toilet. He wasn't using too much at a time, just wiping plenty for peace of mind which I didn't discourage. He loves washing with the bidet and loves now using very little if any toilet paper. He now only uses paper to check for cleanliness before using a designated bidet towel to pat his bum dry.- Low profile: The Brondell is really minimalist and modern in style. One of the reasons I chose this over the Luxe was because it didn't blatantly state \"women\" for the front wash dial and has no protruding knobs to clean. It's also very thin so I didn't have to worry about it bulking under the seat potentially causing weak points and cracking. I also think it looks better with it's clean, streamlined design.- Quality hardware: metal components, yes.- Easy to install- Affordable: the Brondell is one of the most affordable dual nozzle, variable pressure bidets; at the time of purchase it was $15 less expensive than the Luxe Neo 180.What it lacks:- Self-cleaning function: other self cleaning models rinse the outside of the nozzle. The dual nozzle version of the Brondell doesn't have this. However with being able to open the valve slowly I can clear the nozzle if it should ever need it before use. The nozzle also completely retracts and is hidden behind a shield to protect it from any potential GSR (I watch a lot of crime shows). Self-cleaning or not, regular cleaning should be performed anyway just like you would clean your toilet.Side note: this is good value entertainment. My husband was originally adverse to using this as he said in the past he preferred the traditional style, separate porcelain unit bidet (which we don't have in this home). It took him about a week to warm up to the idea of this 'lesser' variant. This morning when reading in bed I heard the best sudden laugh coming from our master bathroom. Then crooning of \"Don't it make my brown eye(s) blue.\"",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Add a dual spray bidet to any toilet",
                "reviewText": "PROS: First off, the price is very reasonable. It\u2019s amazing it took me this long to look to see if this improvement could be made to practically any toilet (check your dimensions against the schematic in the product description but mine fit dead center).2. The provided tee fitting that goes between the bottom of your toilet fill valve and the top of the existing water supply hose, and provides a place to connect the new device\u2019s provided water supply hose is metal (looks like stainless steel) for extra strength. other best selling models had a plastic tee valve.3. The device has two spray nozzles, one cleaning more forward and one pointing directly aft. Some other bidet conversion kits at this price only have the rear spray attachment.4. The control mechanism that turns the water flow on and off, controls spray intensity, and chooses front or rear spray is very well designed and has no protrusions or bumps that will be hard to clean. Other best selling conversion kits have knobs that stick out.5. The spray intensity for the botb jets can be adjusted to clean the area as gently or vigorously as needed.6. It is relatively easy for a non professional to install with a screwdriver and an adjustable wrench. The instructions are clear and have good diagrams.7. The water supply to the bidet provided is braided stainless steel and of excellent quality. It is longish, but that is necessary to deal with a change of hose direction from the tee to the device inlet without causing kinks.CONS: 1. Temperature not adjustable but honestly I found the pipe water on a day below 50F quite tolerable and not too cold for comfort.2. I\u2019ve installed many a toilet, but the reviewers saying they had it installed in ten minutes must have 8 well coordinated hands. By the time I unpacked it, read the instructions, removed and cleaned up the old toilet seat, drained the tank, disconnected the existing water supply from the bottom of the tank fill valve, installed the new tee valve to the fill valve and both hoses to it, connected up the spray device, checked for leaks, reinstalled the seat, and tested the new setup for function, I had 45 min invested. But honestly that would be required for any conversion bidet I saw available, at my experienced rate.3. If your toilet is close to a corner on the left side if you stand facing the toilet like mine, all the water hose and device connections have to be done left handed reaching to the back. It can be accomplished, but you have to be careful not to cross thread, and must kneel down right over your toilet, in a tight spot. This is also true of any conversion bidet. It\u2019s easier to install in a straight wall or right corner toilet placement.4. This device will have to be periodically cleaned well. The toilet seat should periodically be removed allowing full access to areas between the device and the seat and toilet. It will make cleaning the toilet well more involved.OVERALL: Since very few American homes are plumbed and wired for a separate bidet, a conversion kit is the only way to go. To be able to add the functionality for $35 and less than an hour is a great option. Add-on spray attachments are inexpensive and can be changed every few years if they cease functioning as well or get worn or filthy. Really anyone can have the advantages of a good cleaning \u201cdown there\u201d very simply.",

                "reviewText": "Minimal, elegant design. A single brushed metal control that can be understood at a glance. No garish graphics or superfluous, cluttered text. (Amazing how many manufacturers think I want to see the model number every time I sit down!)Installation was pretty easy. The thin mounting plate raises the back of the seat a few millimetres, so I added a pair of slightly larger bumpers to maintain proper support.Time to try it out. The first squirt was a bit of an eye-opener. They couldn\u2019t have calculated the aim of the jet any better. Bull\u2019s eye.But I guess the pressure is largely dependent on the water pressure in your house. I\u2019ve got pretty good water pressure, and inadvertently gave myself an enema.Getting the right pressure required turning the control very, very slightly. This seemed pretty inconvenient, and especially risky for guests using it for the first time. So I\u2019ve inserted a shutoff valve into the water line, with which I can fine tune the maximum pressure. It\u2019d be nice if this was a standard part of the kit.But, all in all, it seems of decent quality, and I\u2019m happy with it. Will see over the coming weeks if I take to washing rather than wiping.Update: Woke up the next morning to a puddle on the floor. The hoses and connections are all fine, but the internal valve is leaking. The rate of dripping is gradually slowing down, so I'm wondering if it will eventually seal itself.Update #2: The dripping did indeed stop in a couple of days. I think there was enough microscopic particulate matter in the water to permanently seal the tiny leak in the valve. It's worked perfectly ever since, and I couldn't be happier.",

They don\u2019t leak until disconnected and reconnected. They may look ok but only expert know. Same rule apply with your appliance when moving get new ose each time.Even if the package come whit everything it need. It dosent come with what your toilette has already pre-installed. So i strongly suggest you buy new ose to replaced the old one on your toilette and you may save your self some leak damage and the expert fee for +-15 $.-Review on usage.I has been 2 week and the first bidet i own. We love it. For number 2 it does a nice job. You mostly have to use 1 or 2 piece of toilette paper to dry the water after usage. Cannot ajuste jet aiming but the aiming is ok. And for the perfect spot just wiggle a bit. The water get cold fast so you want to wiggle lol. Don\u2019t flush before using the water will be already cold.The toilette seat dosent move and i am 250lb. My wife is big to and say it not that good for the front jet she dosent success of getting it where it need to go when women in that period of the month, she say it may because she overweight. For men the front jet work if you to band forward extremely it is not for us but not impossible to use.I got it for less then 50$ and am very impressed with the results. I will of be happy even at 100$.",

Ma femme a constat\u00e9 ce probl\u00e8me; j'ai voulu savoir comment s'en tirerait un homme: pas mieux. Ce n'est pas un probl\u00e8me physiologique, c'est un ajout bricol\u00e9 n'importe comment par le fabricant.Notre toilette est pourtant du mod\u00e8le le plus courant, la lunette aussi, et le jet pour l'arri\u00e8re atteint pile son objectif; j'en conclu que la majorit\u00e9 des utilisatrices auront le m\u00eame probl\u00e8me. Chez-moi, personne n'accordait r\u00e9ellement d'importance \u00e0 cette fonction ajout\u00e9e, alors \u00e7a va; mais si vous choisissez ce mod\u00e8le particulier pour cette buse soi-disant utile aux femmes, vous regretterez cet achat.Par ailleurs, pour quiconque d\u00e9sire un bidet pour sa fonction de base \u2013 nettoyer apr\u00e8s les selles \u2013, c'est un tr\u00e8s bon achat.\u00c0 l'attention de ceux qui ont une toute petite salle de bain ou chez qui la cuvette est \u00e0 35 cm ou moins d'un mur, armez-vous d'un peu plus de patience: il vous faudra une heure, au minimum \u2013 et si vous \u00eates corpulent, vous aurez un plaisir fou \u00e0 vous glisser sous le r\u00e9servoir pour mieux visser le bout du tuyau qui s'y connecte. Il ne faut pas avoir des doigts de g\u00e9ant non plus pour mettre le teflon l\u00e0 o\u00f9 le tuyau et la commande du bidet se connectent l'un \u00e0 l'autre puisque l'embout autour duquel on met, justement, du teflon se trouve dans une cavit\u00e9 dont il d\u00e9passe \u00e0 peine (et pas tout le tour). Si vous esp\u00e9rez vous en tirer sans mettre de teflon, ayez quelques serviettes \u00e0 port\u00e9e de main \u2013 sans teflon, impossible de visser le tuyau suffisamment serr\u00e9 pour \u00e9liminer tout probl\u00e8me d'\u00e9tanch\u00e9it\u00e9.Il a fallut se battre avec ce fichu teflon, \u00e0 cet endroit, pendant qu'un gros quart d'heure fuyait aussi sans qu'il soit possible d'\u00e9ponger cette perte-l\u00e0; pourtant, d'habitude, mettre le teflon prend, \u00e0 condition d'\u00e9chapper une ou deux fois la roulette, une minute? deux? si vous atteignez trois minutes, c'est que vous aviez un torticolis, une entorse, une migraine d'anthologie ou la grippe le jour o\u00f9 vous avez chronom\u00e9tr\u00e9 votre performance.
