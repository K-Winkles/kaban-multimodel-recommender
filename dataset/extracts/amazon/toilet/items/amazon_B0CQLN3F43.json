                "reviewText": "This is a good quality toilet. It looks really good with clean lines. Installation is easy even for a person like me who doesn't like to do home improvements. The flushes are good and strong. I like that you can have 2 types of flushes. I took out one star because the seat rim is a bit too narrow making it less comfortable to fit on and it's rather filmsy. I wonder if it would break quickly. It creaks loudly and it just bothers you when you try to sit on it. I can't recommend to anyone as I worry that they feel the same way as me. And then the seat is specially fit to the toilet, so I don't even know if I will be able to find a replacement that can it it.",

                "reviewText": "The toilet is a small one & fits in the designated space. It looks good and works well. Be aware the toilet seat does not fit this product. The seat itself is too small and cannot be used at all. You will be forced to change it. It actually hurts to sit on and will leave bruising as it digs into your legs. It\u2019s akin to sitting in a plastic bucket. Warning , but and Install seat prior to installing toilet if you get stuck with toilet. Seller initially refused return. Then gave return after I managed the install in this tight space. Too late to return now. So now to figure out how to install a new seat in its existing tight spot. And more money invested in buying a seat that works.",

The people I bought it in from must have been penny pincher because the toilets they chose were the lowest rated & cheapest that that could find. After 20 yrs of sitting on them I decided to buy new ones.. I know, who buys a toilet",

                "reviewText": "Replaced a regular sized toilet in a smaller powder room with this little guy. It fits well and looks great. It\u2019s heavier than a normal one and the package it came in needed a dolly to get in the house. The packaging was also a challenge and getting it out of the box took some effort, but it was certainly well protected. It also was more difficult to install mainly because of it being one piece instead of the usual separate base and tank. It\u2019s at least a two person job because of the weight and getting the screws through the side holes required some help as well. Now that it\u2019s installed, we like it a lot.",
