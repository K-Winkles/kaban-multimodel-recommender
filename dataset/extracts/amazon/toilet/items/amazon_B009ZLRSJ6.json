                "reviewText": "This was my first bidet. Obviously, I do not have a great depth of experience I can use to compare the Luxe Bidet Neo 110 with other bidets, but having used this it for a number of months, I can draw certain conclusions.First, since there are probably many others who, like me, have never used a bidet, I can say that once you try one, toilet paper seems like a really crude method of personal sanitation. The bidet does an excellent job of cleaning, and it is not rough and abrasive in the way that toilet paper is. That means that for any sort irritation or hemorrhoids, it is all the more a must have. Before trying it, I wondered if there would be any issues with aim, or any unknown factors that would make it inconvenient, but I found it to do the job perfectly. The nozzle is not exposed when not in use which avoids contamination. I don't know for sure whether all bidets are designed this way, but they all should be. This bidet is not heated, and just like other reviewers, I found that it really doesn't need to be: there is no more unpleasant or unwelcome a feeling from the cold water when using the bidet than there is when washing your hands under a cold water tap.As for what I can conclude for this particular model: it seems to be well made, the controls are accessible and easy to use, yet not in the way, and there were no surprise annoyances that revealed themselves when I started using it. It was obvious that I had received a good product that represented a good value. I am by no means a plumber, yet it was easy for me to install. It came with one extra part, just in case, that the instructions said probably would not be needed, that could replace the little tube that supplies water to the toilet tank when you connect the bidet to the water supply. The part did turn out to be useful, and it prevented the need to run down to the hardware store and spend a couple extra bucks.The only thing extra that I did was to replace the bumpers on the underside of the toilet seat with taller ones. The bidet is installed where the seat connects to the toilet and adds a little extra distance between the seat and the rim of the bowl. I never even tried using the old bumpers, but replaced them pre-emptively when I installed the bidet, so I don't know if there would have been much of an issue with the old bumpers, but common sense tells me that the the toilet seat may have been left with a slight downward slope and maybe a little extra stress on some components.I cannot think of any complaints about this unit, and it is so much better than toilet paper that I became an instant convert and never looked back. I do not think you'll be disappointed with this bidet.",

                "reviewText": "When I was in Japan years ago, I loved the feel of clean after using a bidet. I did not think we had similar products in the U.S.A. until my husband's nephew raved about this product that he installed on every toilet seats in his house. He recommended LUXE Bidet. So, we bought one for our house then bought another both by LUXE.My husband and I really like the product. For cleaning, this product works great. We use less paper with this product. For those with environmental conscious minds, this is a must have product as you will save on paper. My husband would tell you that it's a must have for cleaning whenever he has a chance.Installation - it took my husband less than 15 minutes to install this product. And... I did not hear any swear words out of him while installing it. :) Afterward, he expressed that it was really easy to install and the tool that came with it was helpful. I think he said something about a T-tool.Look of product - the design is very pleasant looking and it looks like a more expensive product than the current selling price. Plus, it's very study. We used one for almost a year and it still looks brand new and work the same as a new one. I can tell that it will last us for quite a while.Cleaning - It's very easy to clean due to its smooth surface.One reminder though with this product is that the flow of water is very strong. For me, I usually use the first speed and that is enough. I usually go slow with the dial until the right water pressure is met. One time I did forget and went a little too much over to the right on the dial and that did hurt. But, hey it only took once for that lesson.Overall, it's a great product that I would recommend to anyone!",

                "reviewText": "First off I'd say that my toilet paper consumption has decreased dramatically. At minimum a 60% reduction, maybe as much as 90% less because I really only use it now for drying off.The bidet is so wonderful I (serious here) have even invited friends over to poop and try it out. I find myself annoyed if I have to poop anywhere but home, and when I travel I look forward to returning home to my bidet. I feel that it does a better job cleaning than even meticulous toilet paper and moist wipes. Quite by accident I discovered that on occasion, when the user's body is positioned at the correct angle and under the right conditions (which I'm still not quite sure of) the water will actually find its way into the hole for a bit of an internal rinse-out.I agree with the consensus of other reviewers - the water pressure is excessive and perhaps a bit dangerous anywhere beyond the very lowest settings. This is only a negative if someone isn't aware and just jacks the switch all the way on without any caution. Another possible negative is that it very slightly reduces the space at the back of the toilet bowl, so for standing male urination, this gives guys a bit smaller area to aim at. In this household the benefits for the bidet FAR outweigh the possible negatives.The installation was really a cinch, I don't think it even took me 6 minutes to complete start to finish. I have the TOTO MS853113-01 Ultimate Round One Piece Toilet http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018LB7C0/ref=oh_details_o07_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 which is about as close to the wall as the bidet manufacturer's website specifications indicate. It fits very nicely with comfortable room to spare. And the toilet seat (one of the slow-close kinds) needed no adjustment at all. It operates perfectly and with no noticable difference from when the bidet wasn't there. Some reviewers have mentioned the need to use toilet seat bumpers but this was not necessary for me.This bidet _IS_ the way to go. It's inexpensive, seems to be well-made and durable, and it truly does its job well.",

                "reviewText": "I have owned this bidet for 3 years now. It was a simple purchase that upturned my view of the bathroom - It's fantastic. My family has grown to love it too. Definitely one of the best purchases I made for our bathroom.The product its self is great. Fairly simple with nothing really fancy about it. No heat controls, but easy assembly. And pressure is controlled by a dial. I had no issues with the product not working over these 3 years. And as far as my experience with this product has been, I had no leaks or replacement parts needed during this time either.A couple days ago the plastic assembly around the bidet controls to the plastic that goes under the toilet seat snapped almost completely in half. For regular everyday use, this lasted far longer than I had expected. But despite the assembly snapping, the bidet and the controls still work fine. It lasted a solid 3 years, and I think this was an absolutely fantastic purchase for the money, comfort and cleanliness.Will I rebuy the Neo 110? No. I'm now upgrading to the Neo 185 instead.So, why buy this? I think the Neo 110 is perfect if you have never had a bidet before, and want to try it out like I did. It's simple enough that you will understand the point of having one and either like it or hate it.",
