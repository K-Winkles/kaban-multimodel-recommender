                "reviewText": "I've been low-key wanting to add a bidet attachment to my toilet for a while now and finally got around to doing my research and decided to go with this one as a high-quality but affordable option. I decided to get the one that gives you warm water even though there's an extra (plumbing-related) step to installation.I had some trepidation about the installation, as I am SO far from a plumber or handyman or even DIY kind of person, and unscrewing pipes freaks me out. The installation definitely took longer than the advertised 10 minutes; however, it was not impossible and I did manage to get it done in about 30-45 minutes total (though I took a break to eat lunch during a moment of frustration so not sure exactly how long it actually took since I wasn't paying that much attention).The instructions were clear and easy to understand by and large--much more so than what you usually find with instructions on things like this--and you can also see little step-by-step videos on their website if you run into problems. I did run into a couple of issues. I didn't have any problem with the first few steps of the installation--setting up the attachment on the toilet, hooking up the cold water line.Where I ran into problems was on the second part, connecting the hot water under the sink. The first time I tried to connect it, I guess I didn't get the hot water tube all the way onto the T-valve firmly enough, so when I tried turning on the bidet, it shot right out and was spraying water furiously from under the sink (fortunately, the stream went straight into my bathtub so didn't create too much of a mess! but word to the wise--make sure that hot water tube is ALL THE WAY on and flush with the threads; it's hard to get on there, don't think, \"Oh this is probably good enough,\" just keep pushing it harder).That was easy enough to fix (and easy enough to identify where the problem had been). So I fixed that, put everything together, tried the bidet again, and it worked great. But then I noticed that there was a (small but persistent) leak around the T-valve under the sink. Can't have that. This time, it was not as readily apparent what the problem was. I tried tightening everything as much as I could (again) but it was still leaking (and I couldn't even tell exactly where from), so I ended up having to take the whole thing apart again (just the hot water T-valve under the sink, not the entire bidet or anything), put more plumbers tape, and screwed everything back in as tight as I could get it. I guess that must have been the problem before (not tight enough somewhere, or needed more plumbers tape?) because this time it worked...the bidet works great and no leaking (at least not that I've seen yet).My advice for people like me who are intimidated by DIY projects: You can definitely do this, at least if you have access to all the water sources and connections you need, and it can be a one-person job (I did it alone), but expect it to take at least half an hour (don't do it when you're in a rush) and just be patient...As for the bidet itself: It's been less than 24 hours but so far I love it. I don't know if this has to do with the water pressure at my house or the bidet, but the flow is STRONG, so use caution when you try it out the first couple of times--it can blow you away; open it slowly--and (lesson learned) don't test it out when you're not actually sitting on the toilet, unless you want it to spray your wall. It does not stay in the toilet if there's no butt there to catch the spray.But I can definitely see that this is going to both save a lot of toilet paper while also making me feel cleaner, because let's face it...as one of my Italian friends said one time in explaining the value of a bidet to ignorant Americans like me and my friends...if you accidentally put your hand in dog poo, would you feel clean enough just wiping it off with paper, or would you want to use water? Fair analogy and I think the answer is pretty obvious. Team Bidet 4 Life over here!",

                "reviewText": "I have had the 320 model for almost 6 years but the previous design. the only problem I've ever had was the the sprayer is supposed to plunge back up into its housing where it's in a stored position. due to hard water it begins to stick after a year or so. i live in the central US and we typically have hard water so that is why that issue occurs(I'm assuming).The positives: both hot and cold water(i turn it to the cleaning mode and turn the valve to total hot while using restroom to let hot water get to the valve, then turn to cleaning mode). excellent pressure, cleans well every time. Nice design both in functionality and this updated model is a nice jump in aesthetic appeal. I haven't had one malfunction, outside of the plunger issue, 1 time. The hardware that comes with it, to connect to your plumbing, is easy enough. My only recommendation is to make sure you thread everything by hand first so that you dont cross thread the plastic components(and be patient w/ this). This new design swings up as well which makes it so much easier to clean the toilet. I have only had this updated version for a month, so im not sure how it will hold up in the long range compared to the old model, but so far it is doing great comparatively. If i ever have problems I'll make sure to update this review.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. For someone who isn't a plumber, installing a bidet is a day-long, sweaty project after all the parts have been set out and figured out. There will likely be many parts that go unused. Hold onto them as spares, and keep them with the old bidet as a backup. This is my second Luxe Bidet. The quality is good, though the installed product has a delicate feel. Be careful as you install and use it.The instructions, like many whose authors are keen on showcasing their consummate knowledge, contain far too much information, which obfuscates the practical guidance. I ended up setting them aside and figuring out visually which parts go where. There are many parts but figuring them out visually is an order of magnitude simpler than reading and understanding the instructions, which are written to cover every case. This makes it very difficult to abstract the instructions that apply to your particular case, and to figure out which parts they correspond to.Start by turning off the wall valve and draining the tank into a bucket. Then pour out the bucket and keep it under the tank outlet to catch additional drippage.Since I don't have hot and cold output from my tank, I inferred that the supplied end cap is to cap off the hot input (pictured) to the bidet. I then had to use my vice grips and the supplied plastic wrench in tandem to unscrew the tank outlet valve and install the new one. This is sweaty work which, for a non-plumber, has to be painstakingly re-learned from the last installation, especially when the toilet is in a corner that restricts free access to the plumbing. I had to feel my way to aligning the threads so that they would catch and screw in straight. Take care not to strip or damage the nylon threads against the metal threads. The materials are nevertheless a good choice, as they prevent corrosion over time and maintain a water-tight seal. Once that's done, the rest is fairly easy, but that's a big \"once\".The installed bidet is just about as easy to use as the old version, though the main control switch seems more delicate. This main control switch sits closer to the rim than the last model, which makes it hit against your leg unless it is swung out of the way. The old model did not have this problem and seemed mechanically more sound. The main advantage as stated is that this newer model has a self-cleaning spigot and swings out of the way so you can easily clean under it. That's a big advantage that allows the whole assembly to be kept sparkling clean with spray cleaner and a few wipes of a paper towel.The double-height lid bumpers, sold separately, are a must. Position them carefully to ensure they don't slip off the toilet bowl under any usage modes. But them up next to the rim's own pre-installed bumpers for mechanical support. Use super glue to supplement the self-adhesive backing, which won't hold on its own over the long term.Provided the plumbing is well tightened and secure, the end result is well worth the day-long installation effort. It should last you until the next model comes out without the need for additional plumbing adjustments. There is of course play in the mountings which allows for minor adjustments but that's just a convenience based on long industry experience.",

It has everything for a budget conscious person. So glad I found this after looking at many units. I feel I made the right decision.",

The Luxe bidet is easy to use and has worked well for everyone in the family. Getting warm water is easy by just running the tap at the sink first. And being able to adjust the temperature on the Luxe is well appreciated because the water can get too hot! Cleaning is simple with the lift-up hinge and we like that it does not rely on electricity to get a warm water wash. We love it so much that we are ordering another one for the other washroom.",
