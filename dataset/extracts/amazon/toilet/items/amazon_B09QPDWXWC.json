                "reviewText": "So just to be honest, me and my son were watching a movie and I bought this for him. He\u2019s 13 as a gag gift for Christmas. And I had honestly always wondered what it would be like to use a bidet as I have never. So I just installed it last night. I have to say installation was a cakewalk, all of the equipment needed. It has a T that I have pictured that connected to the bottom of the bowl it had Teflon tape included. I did give clear instructions although I did not even use the instructions. It was so simple I just put it right together by Teflon tape all of the joints, snug them up by hand, I did not even have to use a wrench . Everything was very self-explanatory. The only thing that I would say could be improved is the look of there are two snaps valance that hold the unit in place. I don\u2019t know how to describe them other than they are 2 inch discs. OK and I know that it\u2019s made to universally fit in the toilet so they have to make them so big , I just wish I wouldn\u2019t be able to see them quite so much there\u2019s a good 3/4 of an inch hanging off the sides. But that\u2019s me as a incredibly OCD person looking at that and I don\u2019t think that they could actually change the design without making it specific to each toilet, which would not be worth it to them. So I adjusted everything exactly as needed. I had it completely installed within five minutes of starting no issues no leaks. The buttons are pretty self-explanatory , there\u2019s a big booty button and then a female button and then the other button which I couldn\u2019t figure out at first I thought it was broken but that is a self cleaning button and it shoots water down on there. There\u2019s two different shafts that shoot water at two different angles, one for the buuddy and one for the female part. And then there\u2019s a third button that actually shoots water down those two shafts I guess just to clean off any residual splash back from the cleaning process which I find to be an incredibly nice hygienic feature so I don\u2019t have to reach my hand inside the toilet to clean it off. Works like a charm and hit the buttons work good the variable speed knob, adjust the amount of spray that you get which is all I mean it\u2019s just really nice for the money, so I\u2019ll give this five stars all the way.",

Installation was straightforward, and the adjustable settings provide a personalized cleanse. The self-cleaning feature adds a layer of convenience, maintaining hygiene standards. Water pressure is adequate, though a slightly stronger option would be beneficial. The durable construction ensures longevity, but the plastic components feel a bit less premium.While the bidet\u2019s functionality significantly enhances cleanliness, a warm water option could elevate the user experience further. The nozzle positioning is adjustable, catering to individual preferences. The bidet\u2019s eco-friendly nature is commendable, reducing the need for excessive toilet paper.In conclusion, this bidet offers a worthwhile investment for those seeking a more environmentally friendly and hygienic alternative. With a few refinements in water pressure and material quality, it has the potential to become a top-tier bathroom accessory.",

It was super easy to hook up, and I didn't encounter any difficulties. The instructions were clear, and within no time, I had it up and running. No need to hire a professional or deal with complicated installations.What's even better is that the bidet is very reasonably priced. It offers great value for the money. You don't have to break the bank to enjoy the benefits of a bidet. It's a cost-effective investment that pays off in terms of cleanliness, comfort, and saving on toilet paper expenses.Overall, I'm thrilled with my bidet. It has exceeded my expectations in terms of convenience, affordability, and the cost savings on toilet paper. If you're considering getting a bidet, I highly recommend it. It's a game-changer for your bathroom experience, and you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.",
