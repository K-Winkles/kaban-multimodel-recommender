The problem is resolved.Just installed a day ago. The toilet itself is fine. Comfortable, and standard toilet install. The problem is the fill valve. Before purchasing saw some reviews that said it didn\u2019t seat right and leaked. Figured was isolated and a defective part.Now, multiple random times tens with the same problem suggests a design flaw. Somehow the float does give enough pressure on the arm to fully seat the valve. So, there is a really slight, very quiet leak. Have sent an e-mail to American Standard. Will see if I get \u201cIt must be the customer\u2019s fault\u201d story, or some other goofy explanation. Clearly there is a design flaw. The question is whether the manufacturer will acknowledge it and correct it, or come up with some lame excuse. Time will tell.",
