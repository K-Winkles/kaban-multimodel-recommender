                "reviewText": "Overall I'm very happy with this after a couple weeks of use. My contractor said the connection wasn't US standard but he was able to make it work. It's a little loud when it flushes so might be an issue if you have a light sleeper within earshot of it and you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. But other than that, it's fantastic. Looks amazing, functions perfectly. My main concern was that the sensor would go off and it would flush every time I walked into the room because the door swings open right in front of it. But it has never sensed the door and never failed to sense my foot. Very impressive. It also does a little pre-rinse when you sit down, I assume to wet the bowl and make it less likely that anything will stick. Pretty cool technology and if it means I don't have to clean the toilet as often that will also be a net positive. Maybe this is really like 4.8 stars for me cuz of the sound but I would 100% buy it again and if the location made that a non-issue it would be 5 stars. I live alone for now so can't say how it impacts anyone else but I'm working on that \ud83d\ude01",

                "reviewText": "Great toilet, better customer service. Opted to have this professionally installed (I am not to be trusted with plumbing). Toilet worked very well but I had an issue with the electronic noise (a chime that sounds when you sit on the seat). Customer service swooped in with an upgraded replacement and solved the issue right away. They were so helpful. Apart from this, the overall value for this smart toilet is hard to beat.",

                "reviewText": "Works as described very well.Comfortable, quiet, yet solid and sturdy.Water comes from our well and the pressure is adequate for the toilet.I would give 5 stars if there were an installation video I could have referred to, however installation was relatively straight forward. We used the wax ring included with the toilet and have no problems thus far.Update 2/6/24: worked great for almost exactly a year. Abruptly, the flush volumes dropped dramatically to the point it did not release enough water volume to flush at all. I realized there was a debris filter within the elbow connection that came with the toilet. Removed the filter housing and noted debris coating the filter. Cleaned, replaced, and now working as intended.We had a small household filter system which we recently upgraded, and during the upgrade process our pipes must have loosed a slurry of iron/debris which was the culprit.",

The company is great to work with!!The knob that covers the temperature gauge of the seat was missing.They offered to send me a new toilet!!I had already installed it. In 48 hours I had the knob. Great customer service, which in this day and age is sometime missing. I highly recommend Horow. This toilet is great for the value as the more expensive brands are in the thousands. after 6 months the seat didnt heat anymore and the customer service team promptly sent me another one. very impressed with their customer service !!",

                "reviewText": "This toilet has a heated seat. It sprays water in to the bowl when you sit down and often it splashed back up on to your booty- not comfortable. The sensor on the bottom of the toilet that can be foot activated is so sensitive that high steam or a little water splash out of the shower sets it off. I emailed the company and you have to take the toilet apart to make this function inoperable. Also the toilet flushes every time you stand up from the seat. Sometimes I don\u2019t want to flush- for example in the middle of the night- and you cannot change this function. I\u2019m happy I have a heated seat, but otherwise disappointed in the toilet and would not purchase again.",
