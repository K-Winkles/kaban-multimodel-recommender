All the connections were in the right place and everything went well. The second person laid on the floor and made sure that the flange bolts were lined up this the holes in the toilet base. Once in place securing the toilet was easy and the water line was a snap. One in place it is not moving. I works perfectly and the internals of the toilet were preinstalled you you don't have to mess with that. I am very pleased with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Toilet looks great and works great. Glad I chose this brand. But when installing please note to have a deep socket wrench that fits the nuts, because they are on the inside through a 3 inch hole, so you can only turn a wrench about 1/8 of a turn each time. A regular wrench will work but it will take about 20 minutes to secure it to the pipe. Also be sure to connect the hose to the toilet BEFORE you tighten the toilet to the floor, because if you have the toilet secured to the floor, you cannot reach your hand or a pair of players to the hose connection on the back of the toilet., so you will have to remove it from the floor to connect the hose, then go back and tighten it down again.",

                "reviewText": "My husband replaced our three 23 year old toilets because of the severe drought this year. There is a split flush button on top of the tank, one for solid waste and the other for liquid. Before the pandemic I gave up toilet paper which clogged our old toilets at times and replaced it with white washcloths which I get from Target. I keep about 2 dozen in a plastic box on the top of the tank and a small trashcan for the soiled ones which I wash everyday with the white laundry. They are softer than toilet paper, more absorbent and much more economical. One flush from this toilet saves at least 2 gallons per flush. We are so glad we bought these water saving toilets and would recommend them to anyone.",
