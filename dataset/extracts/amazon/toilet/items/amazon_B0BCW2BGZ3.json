I've come across other bidets with less effective designs, especially when it comes to the cleanliness of the sprayer. However, this bidet is different as it doesn't have that issue. I appreciate that it offers separate settings for both the back and front, providing a personalized experience. Not to mention, with the toilet paper scarcity in 2020, this bidet has been a real cost-saver. It's an efficient and hygienic alternative that has reduced my reliance on toilet paper significantly",

Had trouble with leaking initially but it was resolved by replacing the flat washer that came in the package with a more cone shaped one I had laying around. Works very well. This thing has good pressure, so be careful!",

                "reviewText": "The product images provided don\u2019t show what you actually sit upon to use the bidet. It is much more narrow, and depending on your body type, quite possibly uncomfortable for any amount of time let alone long periods of time. No, you should not sit for a while. But if you have diverticulitis or other issues that cause you to visit this frequently and for long periods of time, you will want something comfortable. I have been using this about two weeks now, and I am a fan of the bidet. But the super narrow seat, beyond being uncomfortable, which is a big deal, also does not fit the rim of the elongated bowl. Additionally, there are two options for securing it to the toilet bowl, however, the typical boats will not work with mine for the set up. Because of this, the seat will not stay in one place and continually moves in use. Not enough that you are sliding off, but more than you want in a toilet seat, typically. This can make it difficult to open and as a cis male also stand in front of the toilet throughout the day. If it sounds like, I don\u2019t like it, the aesthetics of its use are still less important to me than the results from its use. And the results are pretty positive overall.",

                "reviewText": "I almost unnecessarily went to hardware store to buy things I didn't need. You DON'T have to install the T-Valve where it shows in the manual, look up Youtube videos on basic Bidet installation and you'll see that its done on the bottom of your toilets tank, not on the incoming water line sticking out of the wall like this manual says. This made the hose size work for me. All else you will need is Teflon tape, and even that is kinda optional to be honest. Oh and some pliers/crescent wrenchRegarding its use, I love it and its one of those things I said to myself why didn't I buy this earlier. The spray for me was super strong, I barely have to turn the knob to the lowest setting because high is way to hard, and now I feel much cleaner much faster and save on toilet paper.",

                "reviewTitle": "fits the application nicely",
                "reviewText": "the item is just what fits the situation since the garbage bin has to sit on the right side and this one ordered from Amazon Basic has a simple design that everything is on the far back without causing interferences. The product installation guide is a bit misleading, as some had complained about the unfit fitting issues. Perhaps the one who wrote the guide do not understand the bathroom plumbing very well. The Tee provided should be connected with the fitting from the tank, which is somewhat standard 7/8\" in diameter, not from the inlet(3/8\") as illustrated on the guide unless you want to buy addition fitting to connect the inlet valve. The finishing of the installation does leave a relatively larger gap between the seat and the base that equals to the thickness of the bidet, which is around 0.4\". The seat will be tilted to the front unless you fit additional bumps underneath the seat. There are more fancy models that claim to be thinner and/or gapless. And this one just fits the application better overall. And also it costs much less :) you can always find good stuffs here at the Amazon Basic. Thanks for the fast delivery by the way!",

Soft-close works great too.",

The raise in height of the back of the seat hasn't bothered me, but it is pretty thick at 0.4\". The issue I have with it is that there is no pressure control. The knob allows for turning up to 90\u00b0, but at 5\u00b0 it's at max pressure. It's basically an on/off switch.",
