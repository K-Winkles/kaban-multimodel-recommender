It is a beautiful toilet that looks stunning. My only complaint is it's a very hard toilet to install. If you are use to putting in two piece toilets there is no comparison. It is very heavy and you can not see the bolts to line up the holes.",

Then, comes my guest bathroom renovation. I ordered this toilet from Amazon, thinking it would be the same. Not so much. My plumber spent 3-4 hours trying to figure out why it was leaking during installation. We concluded that that specific toilet was defective. I ordered another one. Same thing happened. As it turns out, there were small fractures on the bottom of both toilets that had been very shoddily repaired. That's where the leaks were coming from. These toilet are definitely refurbished and did not come straight from the factory. My advice is not to order this product from Amazon. The actual product is great but get it from Home Depot or somewhere else.",

Due to the nature of one piece toilets like this plumbers will up charge for installation as it takes twice as long. Toilet leaked after about an hour it was in. Had to call back plumber next day. We discovered a hair line crack under bowl. Had to run to Home Depot, lug home a basic toilet and call plumber back. Ups guy said he takes toilets and mirrors back all day long. Don\u2019t ever order a toilet to be delivered he said. They always crack! I think the one piece idea is the issue. The pressure is on the area where it connects and with shipping it\u2019s too much for it. Lesson learned. But now I\u2019m out $200.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: The seller still refuses to offer a refund on the toilets, they take zero accountability for the product the are selling. I have filed a claim against them with the Better Business Bureau to resolve.We purchased 3 tiolets for our new home. We have had nothing but issues with all three. They do not produce enough water in the bowl or the tank to carry paper to the main sewer line. We worked with the manufacturer to adjust the water & flush levels and still have the same issue. We have spent thousands of dollars in plumbing to clear blockages. The seller will not offer us a refund. The manufacturer wants to send us 3 more toilets, why would we want replacements when the product is junk. Very frustrating. Do not buy these, the seller puts all the blame elsewhere instead of taking ownership in a product they are selling on Amazon.",
