                "reviewText": "We were eyeing a very expensive competitor but decided to pull the trigger on this lesser expensive brand/model. Both had identical features. So far I\u2019m happy with our decision but will update the durability as time goes on.We bought this toilet to replace another smart toilet by another lesser known brand. This biggest consideration other than cost obviously when choosing a lesser known brand is that they may not always have the parts available in the future as things wear out. And inevitably they will, according to our plumper. We ran into that with our last toilet that needed replacement parts after a few years, yet the manufacturer said they were obsolete and no longer made. The toilet eventually barely flushed as time went on. Well known brands will carry those replacement parts for decades and decades to come. I hope that Woodbridge will as well for this toilet, but only time will tell.The toilet has all the features I wanted in a smart toilet. Two things I will point out, that no one else did in their reviews, are the toilet seat size and auto flush. The toilet seat was about an inch smaller and shorter than our last toilet. At first glance it looks pretty small. I have no issue with its comfort as I was afraid I would. Even our plumber commented on its smaller size. Hard to tell in photos but definitely not a deal breaker. Just something to be aware of.As well as\u2026its auto open feature is not fully automatic. You have to press a button on the remote for the lid(s) to open and close. Not a big deal but not what I was expecting. I expected to walk up to the toilet and for the seat lid to open based on the photos, videos and description. As well as other auto lid open toilets on the market have that feature. Again, not a deal breaker but I was slightly let down by this.Overall, it has all the functions we wanted, looks sleek and rivals big brand names for 4x the price. I hope it holds up more than 5 years like our last smart toilet and we can get the replacement parts a decade down the line\u2026we shall see!Update 10/26/23: Still functioning great! I have noticed the toilet turning off the energy saver function on its own and haven\u2019t figured out why/what triggers this. But otherwise, still very happy with our purchase and would recommend this toilet.",

                "reviewText": "Previously was using a seat replacement for bidet that only ran a line for cold water! Finally decided to go all in with this bad boy and have never been happier. Installation was easy and the most difficult thing was punching a hole in the wall to run electrical. Once that was done the plumbing was actually easier than I expected.Just from the start with the easy open lid and sitting down on a HEATED seat makes all the difference in winter. Bidet options with cleanup and air dry are far better than the basic bidet I had before. If this continues to work this well I'm definitely upgrading my upstairs with the same unit as soon as I have the budget.",

                "reviewText": "Toilet looks nice but my plumber discovered that the angle valve they send is some kind of metric sized valve that won't work with standard US copper lines. I live in a large city and there is not speciality plumbing store that can offer a conversion. I called Woodbridge technical support and the person tried to pass it off like it was a bad valve but I'm pretty sure he knew this is a known issue with products being sent out with wrong parts. I have now had to email their parts department and who knows how long I will be without a toilet before they get the correct part sent to me. I will update this review if/when I ever hear back from Woodbridge on this.Update 11/20/22After several weeks of back and forth with the parts department I was eventually able to get them to send me the correct angle valve. This process was extremely slow as there was no way to just talk to someone over the phone. The parts department responded to an email (often times with one question at a time) every 24-36 hours so it was a ton of back and forth. Towards the end I finally just told them I would pay anything to just get them to send the darn part without all of the back and forth to \"verify\" my issue. At that point, they finally agreed to send the angle valve that should have been included in the first place.When the part did arrive, I had my plumber come back to finish the install. Let me just say that the install process for this toilet required a lot of work arounds to get everything to fit properly. The angle valve they sent comes with a filter that makes the whole angle valve larger than standard. Given there was very little clearance between the toilet and the wall we ended up having to move the entire water line several inches over so that there was enough space for the angle valve to protrude without blocking the toilet. The plumber told me his company has done a few of these units in the past was considering not even agreeing to do these units in the future as they had to run into so many problems in the past.Beyond the terrible service and issues with the install, I was at least glad to finally get the unit working. While the unit does generally work as advertised the water doesn't get nearly warm enough (think closer to luke warm at best). It also doesn't evacuate enough of the initial water prior to spraying so the first 1-2 seconds of water are pretty cold before you are getting the slightly warmed water. Finally the water pressure it is able to attain is far lower than our other seat unit in the house. It works okay, but don't expect this unit to power wash your bum like other brands. We also realized that the sensor in the seat that allows the bidet function to be activated, doesn't work for our kid (I'm guessing due to weight) so he can never really use the bidet function.I am now considering just throwing the whole thing out and replacing it with a standard elongated toilet with a proper bidet toilet seat from a different brand. We have another one of those in our house and it works far better than this one. Excellent heat, pressure, features, and works for kids. Given this low price on this unit vs some competitors I'd probably give this thing as high as 3 stars but with the terrible service they provided when they sent us the wrong angle valve, I'd say 2 is as high as I can go.Update 11/29/2022 - back to 1 starThe unit worked fine for several weeks but eventually the second angle valve they sent ended up began leaking pretty badly. I called the plumber out to investigate and despite a number of attempts to correct the issue and get it to hold a seal, I finally just told the plumber to just tear the whole thing out and switch back to a regular toilet. The customer service with woodbridge was terribly slow and pain staking and I didn't want to go several more weeks without a working toilet. I'm going to buy a bidet seat now. Overall, I liked the look of the woodbridge toilet but there were just too many issues to keep going with it.",

                "reviewText": "Was a bit skeptical due to the cost in comparison with others, perhaps the quality is not there. Time will tell. Regarding installation not difficult, would suggest you measure the drainage/sewer hole from the back wall, if tight you might struggle a bit. Other than that my friend (experienced plumber) took 40-50 min to install. I'll follow up with future comments. Wish me luck.",
