                "reviewText": "We had a leak in a toilet and the plumber who looked at it suggested that it would cost us over $400 to repair or install a new one, even if we bought the toilet ourselves. $400! Having installed a toilet once before, we agreed we would never pay a plumber to do it again, because it's so damned easy. Second problem was when we went to buy a new toilet at the home store, and discovered we couldn't fit it in the car, not to mention the limited choices in stock. It would cost us for delivery, so I turned to Amazon Prime.We bought this toilet, which was delivered to our door. We also bought the blue plastic insert instead of a wax seal, which worked beautifully and seals completely. We had help from a stronger friend for 30 seconds to help one of us to lift it onto a dolly to move it from the door to the bathroom, but other than that, we got the installation done in about ten minutes. If you've never installed a toilet, you could probably find the instructions on a YouTube video, because it's so simple.The toilet itself is nice simple lines, easy to clean on the outside, and aesthetically pleasing. It flushes waste completely and fairly quietly, to our surprise, and it is very effective. The one thing that was a tad difficult was getting the screws in the holes to the floor, (we put tape on the floor to indicate where the holes would need to be, and it wasn't any problem at all), but the side hidden holes look great once you put the caps on.We are feeling very smart for getting and installing this toilet, and are very happy with it. Nice design and works well: what else can you ask?",

                "reviewText": "-I had them installed by a professional who complained and mocked the design, it was a VERY tight space for a hand to install with ease. Doable, as other reviewers commented, but a frustrating process.-The screws come loose over time and the toilet seat scoots to the side, needing to realign the seat and tighten the screws.-The contents of the tank are plastic. A flushing button got stuck and ran for several days using over 2,000 gallons of water, drying out my well the day before having 17 guests for Thanksgiving.-I bought this style of toilet because I liked the convenience of the flat sides for easy cleaning and the dual top flushers. The connection piece around the seat hardware is impossible to thoroughly clean without using a brush to get into all the tight spots.-The seat top is cheap plastic. If you sit on it it indents inward. There are visual smudge-type marks on the lids from manufacturing.-one toilet hisses on and off.I chose this toilet after reading reviews and comparing it to other toilets/reviews. And I'm baffled - something isn't adding up here.I was originally sent two different toilets and got the run around with customer service and Amazon to get them to take back the wrong toilet, it was a frustrating waste of my time.",

                "reviewText": "I researched many toilets for small spaces that don't clog for our bathroom remodel. We are a family of four with one tiny bathroom. I was nervous about the reviews but I went with this anyways because it got some better reviews on Wayfair. I'm so glad I did! It saved space, it's comfortable to sit on, so far the seat is holding up well, and it flushes good too! We've only had it installed for a few days buy so far it's perfect. I'll update if anything goes wrong.",

                "reviewText": "This is the best looking toilet I've ever seen. I concur with the reviews that the seat is a bit meh, but most seats are coming out in acrylic, soooo not really a deal breaker for me. This came packaged and ready to be delivered by someone on a pogo stick during an earthquake, so this seller has rectified their package damage issues. HOWEVER, the plastic stem for one of my flush valves was snapped in half (little super glue and it's good as new). I blame the wholesaler though because when you see the way this thing is packaged... I mean I spent more time unpacking this thing than mounting it to the flange. Here to confirm it's okay for a standard 12\" rough in.",

                "reviewText": "I am a female in a house full of females and picked this toilet because of its sleek design. Its modern and visually appealing BUT ladies BEWARE... with the sleek design the porcelain inside the tank sits fairly close to the private area. The bowl itself is deep but for a woman sitting to urinate expect a light mist of urine on your inner thighs!! Sounds unusual but it happens when I have NEVER before experienced this with the standard toilets. I contacted Swiss Madison to inform them of this issue for I purchased 2 of these and they pretty much told me that it's a personal problem and I could purchase a new toilet seat of my liking and blew me off. They also said this is the first complaint of this sort which is hard to believe. I'm 140lbs at 5'5\" and have never had urine splash back up out of a toilet EVERY TIME I use it. I have to make extra sure to \"slow the flow\" to make sure it doesn't splash against the porcelain bowl. I am stuck with this product for since it was installed they will not take it back or offer any form of credit. I rarely write reviews but had to tell you potential customers about this issue you may potentially have. Now my husband doesn't have this issue for obvious reasons so for the fellas this is a good buy; quite stylish. Ladies if you want to be like me and my girls washing up after #1 add this to your cart today! This company is quick to sell and difficult to remedy. Why not go back to my old toilets? Oh, the installers took away my other toilets and packaging as a courtesy (as well as a hefty fee). Yeah...",
