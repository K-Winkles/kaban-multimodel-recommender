I say fairly bc the instructions are not super clear which side goes up and down when installing rubber grommets. I got it wrong the first time, but it was easy to correct. Clearer instructions would have helped.I cannot recommend though after it failed after 3 months. The water still flows, heated seat is fine, but no more warm water.Last, the settings on it to adjust pressure and direction are not that different. It appears to not change much.We will try another next time. I'd suggest looking at better models or get the warranty?UPDATE- Even though the return window expired from Amazon, the company sent me a brand new bidet. Upgrade to 5 stars just based on outstanding customer service.",

                "reviewText": "Ok first the bad. The T-Fitting gave me trouble. Plastic is the issue here. The supplied flat washer for the t- valve does not allow for complete sealing as compression is needed for the t-valve to seat properly. The wall of toilet valve is too thin to make proper contact. I had to purchase a conical type washer in order to make a proper seal. This of course seals from inside the valve tube rather from the outside.This, of course was very frustrating as to discover by trial and error. The conical washer is of the same type The water supply uses to connect to the tank, so the manufacturer should have supplied this type of washer. I think too a t fitting adapter that goes between the shut off valve and hose would have been a better choice.The good it functions as described in the literature provided. However, as this is my first one, I would like to purchase a upgraded version that has programmable functions that are memorized features such as adjusting the time and sex of the person those would be nice features that are probably available on higher priced models, but for now, this model seems to be as advertised and functions as it should.I got this model on prime day and saved considerable amount of money so I\u2019m happy. The t-valve was the only issue I had. I do like the warm seat and water functions and night light is kinda cool. It does a good job washing your tushy hole. Although it\u2019s rather long on auto mode. I\u2019m hoping it holds up, time will tell. UPDATE: The second one I purchased stopped heating water, had no such problems with the older one. I sent the bad one back and ordered another replacement. I really like these.",

                "reviewText": "This bidet toilet seat is great. It was super easy to install and as long as you use the thread tape to keep leaks from happening ( I had no leaks) it was a dream to install. Took maybe 1/2 hour and I was slow about it. Highly recommended , has most of features other higher priced units has such as unlimited warm water, heated seat, air dryer, you can adjust the temperature of the water and seat. You can move the sprayer in different positions, and it has a water pressure adjustment, nozzle position and more, it has a auto mode that does 4 steps right in a row then done, such as cleaning, massage, dry, and stop. It\u2019s a really good buy for the money and is loaded with features. My wife loves it. I think it\u2019s pretty cool as well . It even has a children button so it adjusts to the smaller body. Really nice. 5 stars in my book .",

                "reviewText": "So sadI purchased the seat due to not needing a hot water line to install. Installation was a breeze and the seat was working great until last week. I have only had the unit for less than 2 months when various buttons/sensors stopped recognizing contact and was not beeping. Unplugged and plugged it in and that seemed to reset to allow for proper functioning for a few days.Today when I try to lower the seat temp by pressing the correct button, the unit turns itself off. Bidet feature does not work. Not sure what is going on and it is past the window to return.Was really looking forward to this seat, and was hoping it wouldn\u2019t have any issues.If it fixes itself, I will write a follow up review indicating so. Hence the current low rating.",

                "reviewText": "Good alternative to the more expensive bidets on the market. Nicely designed and fitted well for my round toilet. Very easy to install although the instructions are for a couple of models. So, you have to figure out with instructions to use. Also, the controls seem to not apply to this particular model. However, it is very easy to work the controls. So far, all the features work great (after 3 weeks of use). I love that I can set the positions, seat temperature (for those cold winters!), water temperature, and air pressure and temperatures. The glow night light is particularly useful too!",

                "reviewText": "I am rating the customer service of this seller. Top notch as they are truly trying to do good and have buyers. It isn't their fault that the product is not as good as the Toto toilet. This seller is reliable, keep their word, and the seller tries to do everything possible to keep the buyer happy. The spout is not as accurately placed as a Toto washlet and it is better for smaller people. By smaller I mean the seat is small and be careful with the setting of the water, it can be too hard. Not a bad washlet, but it could be improved. If you have a Toto washlet you can see and experience the differences immediately. The light is very nice and convenient at night time. Not sure what the deodorize button is because there is no deodorant in it.The customer service is absolutely amazing! You get refunded if your washlet doesn't work as it's supposed to.",
