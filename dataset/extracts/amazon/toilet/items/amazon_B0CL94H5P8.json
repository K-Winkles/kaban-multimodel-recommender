We only used the system for a few months for the 1st time this year and it constantly would shut off, was loud like it was whining and burning up. It flooded our bathroom a few times when it would shut off. Now it has completely stopped working. This product is definitely not worth the money. And like other people have stated, trying to get in touch with the companies customer service to figure out how to fix it or what is wrong, is impossible and non existent.",

It did take a few days to get a response, as the phone number doesn\u2019t work and the email said it was undeliverable, but it then eventually went through!Cons: The pump/motor broke after less than 1 year. This toilet is in our basement and isn\u2019t used too often, so I couldn\u2019t believe it just died so quickly. These should last 10+ years, especially for almost $1k. They did send me a replacement pump free of charge, which I very much appreciate, but I am now incurring additional plumbing costs to have it reinstalled again, 11 months later. So just a caution!",
