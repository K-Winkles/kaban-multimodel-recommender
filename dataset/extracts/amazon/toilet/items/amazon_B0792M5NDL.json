        "description": "The TOTO aimes Washlet+ one-piece elongated 1.28 GPF universal height skirted toilet with cefiontect has a bold and modern high-profile design, projecting toto\u2019s mark of excellence: \u201cpeople planet water.\u201d the TOTO aimes features a sleek, one-piece design that will immediately beautify the appearance of your bathroom. The one-piece design is not only aesthetically pleasing, but also offers the benefit of being easier to clean versus a two-piece toilet. By removing the gap between the tank and bowl, we eliminate the hiding place for dirt and debris. An additional benefit of the one-piece toilet is that there is no threat of leaks from bolts or gaskets that can occur in two-piece Toilets. The skirted design of the TOTO aimes conceals the trap way, which enhances the elegant look of the toilet and adds an additional level of sophistication. Skirted design Toilets also eliminate the need to reach behind the bowl to clean the nooks and crannies of the exterior trap way. The TOTO aimes features toto\u2019s tornado flush, a hole-free rim design with dual-nozzles that creates a centrifugal washing action that assists in rinsing the bowl more efficiently. This version of the TOTO aimes includes cefiontect, a layer of exceptionally smooth glaze that prevents particles from adhering to the ceramic. This feature, coupled with tornado flush, assists to reduce the frequency of toilet cleanings, minimizing the usage of water, harsh chemicals, and time required for cleaning. The TOTO aimes is designed in toto\u2019s universal height, which allows for a more comfortable seat position across a wide range of users. This version of the aimes offers TOTO T40 Washlet+ compatibility for when you are ready to upgrade. Washlet+ Toilets feature a channel on the bowl surface to help conceal your Washlet+ Supply line and power cord for seamless integration. The aimes comes ready for install into a 12 inch rough-in, but may be adapted for a 10 inch or 14 inch rough-in with the purchase of a separately sold Adapter. The aimes is ADA Compliant and meets the standards for epa Water Sense , and California's CEC and calgreen requirements. The TOTO aimes has a left-hand chrome trip lever and an included TOTO Soft Close seat.",
