                "reviewText": "Was chatting with a few friends and somehow the conversation turned to bidet seats. My friends who had them swore that they were absolutely fantastic and a must have in any bathroom. I thought they were crazy.After thinking about it for a while, I decided to get one to see what the fuss was all about. I did some research and this Kohler model came up as highly rated and the price was pretty good, so I bought it. The seat is very easy to install and comes with all the hardware needed. Everything was a very good quality and went together well. If I had one gripe, it would be that it's difficult to align on the toilet due to the fact that it has a separate bracket that installs apart from the main seat, so you really can't see how things line up until you slide the seat onto the bracket. However, this design makes it very easy to attach and detach for cleaning, if you ever needed to.The seat functions well and I like the fact that it has two separate cleaning stalks which work in slightly different ways to get you clean. Both cleaning stalks spray water with very accurate aim. There are a few types of Bidet seats, some which have heated water, and some that don't, like this one. Each has its own advantage. The non-heated models (like this one) don't require electricity and generally have more cleaning power since they don't rely on an internal pump for the water spray. Heated models are less powerful and require a power source, but they do have heated water, which some people might want. I was worried about this since spraying cold water on yourself might be a shock, but in reality, it's not a big deal and not worth the extra price / complexity of a heated model. Apparently, humans don't have a lot of sensitivity down there, so the cold water really isn't much of a shock.I'm really satisfied with how this thing works and it's a must-have in any bathroom.",

Making that side valve fitting connection would take a bit longer. Kohler is genius with this device. Super effective and super comfortable . Also very neat and tidy with no overspray. Very sturdy and durable too. I am delighted with this purchase after having doubts when I ordered it.",

They aren't so much in use in the US, and the European model with the spray nozzle in the middle of the toilet bowl is a big part of why it isn't used here. This is the function of a bidet integral to the toilet seat, which we all use anyway. This model has a handle on the side that directs water flow and volume to where you want it. It is a basic design. The water is cold water and the delivery mechanism is mechanical. Compared to the elite models, the water isn't heated, the seat lid doesn't automatically raise, there is no warm air to dry your nethers, but it works and it is reliable (something that cannot be said for the elite models that are electronically controlled and tend to fail). Everyone: You will wonder why you didn't start using a bidet a long time ago. There's nothing like a clean backside! Women: You can put an end to urinary tract infections just by using a bidet. ; D",

                "reviewText": "The hose to the toilet / bidet leaks. Called the supply company on the weekend, which is when I have time to deal with it. The store does not handle product issues when ordered online. Was told to call back during the week to their e-commerce team. So they take orders and deliver quickly but support is limited. Going to return the product and buy different brand from different supplier. Will update the review if someone reads and responds to this issue today and takes ownership of the customer problem. Otherwise, be cautious of this product and seller if you depend on Amazon suppliers for quality and customer service.",

                "reviewText": "I was not expecting much when ordering this product. First off it was very easy to install. Everything you will need is included. The only thing you might need depending on what type of connection you have whether it is a solid or flexible braided connection. With the solid one your going to need to get a slightly shorter connection if you have the flexible one it will work just fine. The bidet is also easy to align. There is a little button on the back rear right side of the assembly. That makes removing the upper assembly to tighten the bottom bracket. Itis also nice that there are instructions on the lid for those first time users. It does a decent job. My only issue is that I wish there was a temperature adjustment but being a manual non-powered model that isn't possible. Overall it is a very well built easy to install bidet that does a decent job. Well worth the 100.00 price.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve recently suffered through a brutal back surgery that left me incapable of properly cleaning myself without help. Seeing as how that action is a very personal thing, I was overjoyed to finally purchase and install this Kohler Purewash Manual Bidet Toilet Seat. All I can say is Wow, what a wonderfully refreshing way to thoroughly clean your bottom. No more skid marks in the old undies, and no more funky rear end at the end of the day. This jewel vigorously, and refreshingly washes away all the bacteria that just wiping with toilet paper leaves behind. Because I was unable, I had a plumber install the seat (it would have been easy to do myself if I hadn\u2019t just had back surgery). I do not have an electric outlet near the toilet so I purchased the cold water only bidet seat. I was afraid that the cold water rinse might be a touch off putting, but the spritz is actually very refreshing. My wife loves it and uses it for both front and back hygiene, and our toilet paper usage has been literally cut by 2/3. The savings in toilet paper will make up for the installation cost within a year. I truly wish I\u2019d discovered this means of toilet hygiene five decades ago.",
