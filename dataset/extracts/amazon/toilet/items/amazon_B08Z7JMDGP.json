                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. As a wheelchair user, it is important to me to be able to do as much personal care as possible and a bidet allows me to do so. The last one I had was a very fancy model, but that comes at a hefty price. There was so much that could go wrong and that is why I ended up replacing it rather quickly. I came across this one at a really good price and I originally thought I would use it until I found another high end one.Much to my surprise, I actually like this one better, because it is so simple. It was very easy to install. It takes a couple of minutes to install the t adapter into the water pipe. After that, all I needed to do was screw in the hose and sprayer. With my last one, I had to get a handy man to help because it needed to be connected to the hot water, mounted to the toilet, and then the seat replaced on top of it. Not everyone has this issue, but with the other one I had to alter my handicapped rails because it took up so much extra space. I didn't have that problem with this one, because it didn't need any additional room. If you are limited on space for whatever reason, this is something to consider before deciding on a bidet.It does lack some of the features that I had before like being able to adjust the temperature, but I really don't miss it. If you are in a very cold climate, maybe this would bother you, but even on really cold days I don't have a problem with it. I was able to adjust the water pressure with both models,but it was a much easier process with this one. How hard you squeeze the trigger determines how high the pressure is. With the other one I had to adjust 3 knobs and it was mostly trial and error. It is great for families because it is so simple to adjust where the water is pointing. With the last one, I kept having to adjust it whenever someone else used my bathroom. You can also spray off your lady bits whereas most bidets are pointed at the back area only.It's very convenient for people who plan to use it on someone other than themselves as well. A traditional bidet is made for the user to control. However, this sprayer is much easier for a caregiver to use or to help a child on the toilet. It's also very handy for rinsing out cloth diapers or period panties. I have even used it while cleaning the toilet and the nearby tub.",

We keep the nozzle laying in the bathtub as on RARE occasions the sprayer lever sticks and it oozes water, but that has only happened 2x in a year. NOTE; if you have small children, turn off the nozzle each time as it makes a World Class squirt gun and will spray water a good 30+ feet",

                "reviewText": "This works great and installed in about 30 minutes. You might need two adjustable wrenches, one to torque the t-joint and another to hold the bottom of the toilet inlet. A wrench and plyers may work too. The adjustable spray is strong enough to blast away thick poop from a dirty baby diaper, but can also be used as a gentle rinse. If you get a sprayer that only has one power level and it's too strong, you'll get splashed too much. If it's too weak, it won't spray off enough baby poo. The handle does stick in the holder some, but you can wrap it in tape to solve this small problem.This sprayer has an off valve so you can turn off the water to it when not in use. You don't want a hose sprayer leaking when you're not home and flooding the bathroom. The valve is very easy to turn and is clearly on or off just by looking at or touching it.I took back one star because the rubber ring around the spray handle gets stuck in the holder. I had to use one hand to hold the mount in place on the side of the tank, and the other hand to take out the sprayer. I got tired of this and wrapped the rubber ring in clear tape, so now the handle doesn't get stuck in the holder anymore.Be sure to buy a diaper spray shied like the SimplyImagine SprayStand which I recommend.",
