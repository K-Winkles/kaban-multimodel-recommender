Our guest bathroom toilet seat has the bad habit of loosening up and taking visitors on a ride. I tried double nutting the old plastic hardware to no avail. I ordered these hoping they would fix the problem. The toilet seat is now mounted solid and won\u2019t take visitors on an unexpected ride. It\u2019s only been a few days, but I see no cause for concern that these will work loose. They grip extremely well and won\u2019t slip threads like the plastic ones do. I would definitely recommend these.",
