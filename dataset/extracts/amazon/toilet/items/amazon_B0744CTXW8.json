This is the first time I have had a toilet that the \ud83d\udca9 sticks to the bowl, it\u2019s awful. This wasn\u2019t an issue with my old toilet. Also installation is difficult. Very little room to work between the wall and the toilet. The seat isn\u2019t bidet compatible, I have had the seat break one bidet. Without bidet bumpers, which come off if you get cleaning solution on them. Without bumpers it forces the bidet down and therefore doesn\u2019t spray where needed.",

Such nice, friendly, and accommodating young men left the toilet right where I wanted it. Checked to see that the toilet was unscathed as the box suffered damage during its stay at a warehouse. The toilet looks fantastic, a bit cold to the tush, due to the material, but a wonderful toilet regardless! A little more complicated to install than your regular porcelain throne but well worth the price/hassle.",

He was unable to fit his hands through the opening, so he purchased an extension. It is beautiful and simple to clean. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the seat, it is cheap plastic and is specific to the brand so cannot be replaced with a generic seat. I am hoping Swiss Madison has a better quality seat this one looks and feels like it came from the dollar store.",

Have been satisfied (only small problems items that I could get the plumbers to correct) until the last one I bot for my daughter for her remodel. That Swiss Madison St. Tropez had a tiny pinhole blemish in the porcelain that leaked water. She finished the upstairs remodeled, including the guest bath. She travels a lot for business and was dismayed to find upon arrival home that the entire new bathroom floor was saturated with water. The floorboards buckled and the tile popped. In 2022 we submitted a claim with pictures, contractors estimates...everything they required. Then we WAITED. We called several times during the 13 months, and they indicated they were \"working on it\", so we wait And WAITED. January 16, 2024, we got an email that they would not pay any reimbursement for damages. So not only has the bathroom been out of commission for over a year as they led us on, but they they refused to pay damages on a defect that caused the toilet to leak. Companies who do not stand behind their products should not be allowed to sell their products, especially on Amazon!",

                "reviewText": "First off, overall, I'm happy with the form and function of the toilet but that's about it. Now for the price I can understand that not everything is going to be the best feeling or best quality. But that doesn't mean you should cheap out on these bits. First of all the covers for the toilet seat quick release. The ones that cover the screws, aren't even painted. They have this cheap gray sticker that comes off so easily it's really disappointing and now I have to spray paint them to at least blend in. The other part is the fit of the top cover where you have the two selectors. The fit is off as far as the curvature. You get used to it, but I'm guessing the cast mold is not the greatest and they probably have a little deviation as far as measurements. Everything you need comes with it, other than the water line. The side covers that clothes off where you tighten the bolts are a little flimsy but I don't plan on taking those out constantly.Again, it's not a bad toilet and if it's my bathroom very well regarding the style and the dual flush is a nice touch. I just wish there was a little bit better quality control. Honestly, if the covers were actually painted white, I probably would have given this five stars and just mention the fitment issue.",

I adjusted the internal mechanism to have a more powerful flush, but it did not help. The toilet was installed by a plumber - who said it was very difficult to install and there were no floor bolts. Swiss Madison, is unreliable, even though this toilet has a warranty they could not replace toilet because I live in Canada. They told me I had to work it out with the place I bought it from. Thankfully Amazon, helped me. Returning a toilet purchased online is a nightmare, do not do it! This is a nice looking toilet, and there are some happy customers out there - but if you get into a problem with this toilet, Swiss Madison will not help you. They do not have a chat or call centre. Have to do everything by email and wait days for a response. Toilets are probably the most important thing in your house - as I discovered. My advice, stick with American Standard, Kohler, or TOTO.",
