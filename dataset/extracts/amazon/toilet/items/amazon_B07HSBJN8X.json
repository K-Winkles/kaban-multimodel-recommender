The TOTO NEOREST AH comfort features begin as soon as you approach. The seat automatically opens hands-free to welcome you in while the nightlight will illuminate your path in the dark. An automatic PREMIST spray wets the toilet bowl surface before each use while the CEFIONTECT ceramic glazing prohibits waste from sticking to the bowl. The combination of the PREMIST and the CEFIONTECT minimize the frequency of cleaning which helps reduce the amount of chemicals required to clean the toilet. The heated seat has five seat-warming temperature settings that are especially useful during the cold of winter. An automatic air deodorizer activates to hide unpleasantries to create a more enjoyable experience. As your journey comes to a close, you can access the remote control and start the cleanse process. You are in total control as you select a front cleanse, soft rear cleanse, rear cleanse, oscillating cleanse, pulsating cleanse, and customize the warmth and volume of the spray. You may also decide to select one of the two user memory settings to instantly dial in your preferences. The warm air dryer function has five temperature settings that can be used to reduce the moisture left behind after the cleaning process. The automatic flush will begin as soon as you rise with the powerful flushing 1G TORNADO FLUSH system, to whisk away all evidence. Designed with a backup manual flush override in case of power outages or if manual operation is needed. An automatic EWATER+ cleansing mist will spray the bowl with electrolyzed water to further aid in keeping the bowl clean. As the lid automatically closes, you can marvel at the beauty and technology behind the NEOREST",

No need to flush after using it, it does it automatically. It has a bilt-in bidet and dryer. There is a self cleaning setting too! Our plumber had no problem installing it. The operating manual is fairly easy to follow. Love my new Toto toilet",

                "reviewText": "Found these types of Toto toilets while on vacation in Bali. Had to get one. Heated seat. Welcomes you when you enter the room, cleans itself, lights up, cleans you with warm water and tons of adjustable settings. Deodorizer starts when you sit. Auto flushes and the lid closes when you leave. What more could you ask for in a toilet. Love it. I think 4 of my friends have bought one since they saw mine. Instructions say it flushes 33 feet of toilet paper with it's jet-like flush but I can't for the life of me figure out how anyone can use 33 feet of toilet paper in one sitting. Have not smelled anything in the bathroom for over 6 months. Everybody should have one, or two.",

That\u2019s the way I feel when I\u2019m out of town and don\u2019t have my Toto. Was it crazy expensive? Yup. Is it worth every penny? Absolutely. I would have paid double. We\u2019ve had our Neroreat 989 since early 2021 and it has had a few hiccups but I try and take care of the thing like a pet. Gotta keep up up to snuff. I can\u2019t use other toilets my bottom just says no. If you are on reading reviews and are on the fence, get off that fence and get your tush on this heated seat. The cleaning power does the job your exit will thank you later no more TP ouchies or swamp a$$ either. Do it.",
