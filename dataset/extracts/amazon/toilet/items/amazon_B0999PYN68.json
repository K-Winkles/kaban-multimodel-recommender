                "reviewText": "I wanted the 1.6 gallon flush capacity and the standard height bowl. I'm not sold on the higher toilet seats. My darling wife is 5'2\" and I understand that higher toilet seats can cause shorter peoples' legs to go to sleep. And remember, if Mama ain't happy, ain't nobody gonna be happy. Instead of buying a 94 dollar plastic slow close Toto seat and lid, I bought an elongated Mayfair enameled wood slow close seat at lid at a 50-60 dollar savings. In my opinion, enameled wood seats are more comfortable and last longer than plastic. The bone color of the seat matches the bone color of the toilet perfectly.",
