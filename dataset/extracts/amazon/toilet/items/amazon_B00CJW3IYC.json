We love the added height, dual flush, elongated bowl, clean design lines and flush levers on the side where they belong instead of on the top.I installed both units. Wax rings sealed tight, water connection matched without leaks and unit secured firmly to the floor. We bought a quiet close heavy duty Kohler seat that is extremely durable.The seating wax ring do not come with the toilet.The valve fills the tank rapidly and quietly at 55 lbs. of house pressure.Kohler included great fitting and looking covers for the floor mount bolts.You must provide your own tools to do the installation.",

Called Kohler and they were great and are sending out a replacement bowl via a different shipping method.Second toilet arrived today and once again the bowl is smashed. Same deal with Kohler.Long story short, Kohler has been awesome to work with but Amazon does an incredibly poor job of packaging the bowls.Now I have to wait another 2 weeks to get my toilets...Just order direct from Kohler and save yourself the hassle.",

                "reviewText": "This fixture functions very very well. Two choices for flushing---both very low water use ---and they both work at least as well as the old high water use one. And it is quieter than the old one. The item was shipped quickly and very well packed in two boxes, making it reasonable for us to get it upstairs before the plumber came. The water reservoir is slightly narrower than the previous twenty year old fixture, so you may need to patch up the painting behind it.The plumber believed that we got the same price or better than he would have.",

                "reviewText": "FALSE ADVERTISING: The photo on Amazon shows a COMPLETE toilet, does it not? Love the toilet, my plumber has installed it, but very, very, very upset (P.O.'d really) that I have to wait over another week without a toilet. Let me ask you this: would you buy a car online only to later discover that it had no doors? So you have a car that sits in your garage for a week, and you're without transportation because you're waiting for the doors to arrive? Doors are pretty basic, you expect them to be included, right? Well, seats are pretty basic to a toilet are they not? You expect it includes a seat right? That's what's happened to me. The toilet was delivered but it HAD NO SEAT. And we're not talking about a huge additional expense, as the seat is only 40 lousy dollars. For that piddly amount, why not live up to consumer expectations and include it??? Or picture it lidless? Or charge $40 more?",
