                "reviewText": "I fell in love with modern Japanese toilets when I was visiting there. They gently spray clean and air dry your tush, some even play music for you while you are doing your business. They felt so luxurious and are not easily available here in the states. In trying to replicate my experience, I found this very affordable Aresmata bidet attachment and thought I would give it a try.First of all, it is ultra-slim and the toggle switch and push button controls are very attractive and easy to reach compared to the clunky, obtrusive knobs on other manufacturers\u2019 models. It looks good on our contemporary design toilet. Attaching the unit was fairly easy, it was one of those do-it-yourself project that my partner was able to handle.In use, it was not the whole Japanese experience, but still very good. You have a choice of cleaning your bum or your feminine parts, the water pressure is adjustable for your comfort level. What\u2019s more, the nozzles retract and the unit is self-cleaning. I don\u2019t have to worry about toilet paper being out of stock like during covid. Once you get used to it, you will feel so much cleaner and are dare I say, fresher and healthier. An excellent buy.",

I had to drop in and share my thoughts on the Aresmata Bidet because, honestly, it's a game-changer and worth every penny. I WISH I had this when the pandemic hit . . . Yall remember the toilet paper shinanigans?Let's start with cleanliness. The dual nozzles and adjustable water pressure set this bidet apart. I've tried others, but the precision and thoroughness of the Aresmata are on spot. Plus, you get the choice between a gentle cleanse or a more robust spray, catering to individual preferences.Now, what really makes this bidet stand out is the value it offers. I've checked out a bunch of bidets in the market, and for the features it brings, the Aresmata is competitively priced. The cleanliness and comfort it provides make it a real bang for your buck.The fit is another win. The ultra-slim design seamlessly integrates with standard toilets like mine, making it versatile for different bathroom setups. Installing it was a piece of cake, and they provide handy guides and videos to assist, which I found super helpful.In terms of value, considering the features and the overall experience, the Aresmata Bidet holds its own in the market. It's not just a purchase; it's an investment in your daily comfort and hygiene routine. If you're shopping for a bidet and want a fair deal without compromising on quality, the Aresmata is the way to go. Trust me, you won't be disappointed",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Easy to use, budget friendly, but take time installing",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Perhaps purchasing this bidet would have most ideal during Covid-19 with toilet paper shortages and all, but I thought the time was right to give it a try now. I had thought about buying one before but was unsure of how much they cost and wasn\u2019t sure of how much would be involved considering the involvement of do-it-yourself plumbing. I recently went on and saw this unit priced under $40.00, and felt comfortable settling on the Aresmata version because it looked minimal in design and advertised being easy to install.I have had this bidet for a week now, and the whole item shipped in a package about the size of a sheet of paper and maybe 3 inches thick - compact.I had seen online videos to see what to expect, and again, I liked that this design was minimal, as the size of the package demonstrated. There were literally two major components and about 5 mounting parts. The major parts of the bidet felt strong in hand and feel like ABS plastic.Having simple and few pieces I ended up underestimating on the installation process. Follow the manual to a T and I would highly advise using the packaged / included teflon tape. The issue I had was that although the connecting plumbing parts include in the Aresmata bidet are all metal, which was great, the existing plumbing I was attaching were all plastic, which was bad. Those parts didn\u2019t seat straight at first and would dribble out water. After trying a few times, including having to reapply teflon tape twice on 2 separate parts, I got everything connected without leaking.With that behind me, the rest of the installation was simple, and I made sure to align the actual spraying part of the bidet as close to the center of the opening of the toilet as possible.I have included pictures of the connecting pieces. The distant connection is a T-stop where the existing water supply hose now connects, but use to connect straight to the underside of the toilet tank. The closer connecting hose, which is slightly blurry, is the bottom connection to the bidet\u2019s controller.The bidets controller and its buttons are self explanatory, and at first glance seem like they may be powered in some way, but they are completely mechanical. There are basically 3 modes to chose from, all of which water pressure level can be adjusted for each, and all modes are either \u2018on\u2019 or \u2018off\u2019.The video I have includes a demonstration of all of the above listed modes. (I have added bubbles as I did not want to offend anyone with the hard water stains in the bowl.) This being my first bidet, I have found no need to use more water pressure than half. As you can see in the video, full power seems like it\u2019d be too much. The first button follow \"OFF\" is feminine cleaning, and sprays further forward, and the last feature is a self cleaning feature for the nozzles.One thing I was concerned about was if the parts would stay clean from use. I will update this as I go, but the spray nozzles are hidden until use, which I feel will help keep them clean. Also, the nozzle part of the bidet is removable from the seat by simply unlocking, where it can be cleaned manually as needed.So far this bidet is has been great in its simplicity so far, and is sans anything fancy such as heated water. I plan to use it for many years to come and feel happy about the experience so far. I still do use toilet paper supplemental to using the bidet, but it is dramatically less that with toilet paper alone. Also, I feel I may have gotten lucky, but I would recommend trying to get the spray part of the bidet as close to the center of the bowl as possible because, for me, this ended up being the precise aim for the cleaning stream. No adjusting on my part in the seat required.One things I will say that I noticed not listed in the manual, and is completely understandable, is that they bidet will not have water pressure directly following a flush, at least until the tank is refilled. This should be expected since it is a manual device and this is reasonable by design.I would highly recommend this bidet for anyone wanting to try on out, and most likely save on toilet paper and get a better-than-paper alone clean. I will update this review after a few more weeks of use. Thank you for reading and I hope this helps.Ron",
