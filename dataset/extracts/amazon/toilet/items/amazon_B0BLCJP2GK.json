The unit arrived in apparent decent condition according to the outside of the box. However, not visible to the eye, the inside of the bowl was cracked and leaking on the floor from the inside. Superflow was quick to respond, Yvette, and sent a replacement toilet base within a week. I am very pleased with that response and the performance, thus far, with the product. Nice job Superflo!",

                "reviewText": "I swapped the fill valve out to a standard 7/8 so I can use an added bidet and standard lines. As for the quietness of this product, it's more noisy than I could have imagined, like a jet ramping up it's engine. I used 1-1/4 pipe for 30' then upsized to 1-1/2 per instructions, I went up and over my roof to hook to clean out outside. Not crazy how little the bowl fills with water but it works. Update: pump tank is leaking from bottom, not a lot but still worried if tank will explode one day.Update: The leak was coming from the plug that is used when your not using one of the inlets.",

Had plumbers come tell me they could install a regular toilet for $5,000-8,000. Found this toilet and saved myself a little over $4,000 after my extra supplies I went out and bought.It's a little loud but when you consider what's all involved and what it does in such a small factor & being an outside toilet it's well worth it.Came packaged greatly, no chance of breaking unless dropped off a truck.",
