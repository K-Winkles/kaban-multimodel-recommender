This is a top of the line toilet and Woodbridge does a great job with everything from A to Z. The dual flush options are perfect for our family. The toilet is sleek and modern looking, but also use much less water so they will save us money in the long run.Two things to note: 1) the dual flush buttons were roughed in the wrong way, but were easily switched around to the appropriate side. 2) the toilet is very heavy and requires two person minimum, three person optimal to install.Overall I am very pleased with this purchase.",

We actually couldn't make this one fit in the bathroom we wanted it installed, but it worked in the other one (just barely). Frankly, however, I don't much care whether the installers have to work a little harder to install it, as I am paying them to do it. Just know that these are harder to install, and we almost had to send it back, b/c it wouldn't fit where we originally wanted to put it.",

Our previous toilet had the worst flush because of our water pressure is not that good.This toilet flushes very strong leaving the bowel clean. Cleaning The lower exterior is super easy because of the shape . Not like older toilets that you have to get on your knees to reach the different shape on the sides and bottom . This toilet is a fast easy clean .",

                "reviewText": "Updating a year later. The toilet itself, great. HOWEVER, 11 months after installing it, the slow close toilet seat stopped \u201cslow closing\u201d. At times, the lid would literally crash down when touched. I lifted the seat off its hinges and found a mass of clear, sticky \u201cgoo\u201d all over one of the hinges, and all over the toilet beneath where it had been seated. I contacted the company, included a photo of the hinge covered with \u201cgoo\u201d, and asked if there was a fix for this. The reply I got was borderline insulting\u2026 asking me to send a video showing that the seat wasn\u2019t closing properly (as if I were lying, and as if the photo I\u2019d sent wasn\u2019t clear evidence that something was wrong with the hinge). I responded with the requested video (the seat crashing down, not slow closing). Next thing I get is a suggestion that I pay them $60 for a new toilet seat. So I can expect it to last less than a year AGAIN, and have to keep spending $60 to replace it? Frankly, while the toilet itself works great and looks great in our remodeled bathroom, I question the company\u2019s commitment to customer service, when an inquiry like mine is treated as if I\u2019m lying about a problem, and then tell me to pay for the correction to a problem that is obviously one of their own manufacture. If this is Woodbridge\u2019s idea of \u201ccustomer service\u201d and standing behind their products, I\u2019d be very careful and would think twice about buying from them in the future. Fingers crossed that this toilet lasts longer than a year or so\u2026 but now I\u2019m concerned that it, too, might have a manufacturing defect, and if so, they\u2019ll expect me to pay to replace it. I won\u2019t\u2026 not with another Woodridge product. My suggestion to the company would be to hire customer service reps who believe their own eyes when presented with photo evidence of a problem, rather than further question the customer\u2019s honesty. Never again. My original review from the time of installation a year ago follows:We couldn\u2019t be more pleased with this purchase. I\u2019ll admit, installing the toilet was a bit of a struggle (hence only 4 Stars on that point)\u2026 it takes two people to lower it into position, while at the same time trying to look down at the template on the floor\u2026 not particularly easy to do, and it took more than one try. On the first try, just slightly off-target, the weight of the toilet rested on one of the two brass bolts, and caused it to bend\u2026 so extra bolts were needed. Thankfully, we had extras. Also, we\u2019d opted to use a universal gasket (Fluidmaster 7530P8 Universal Better Than Wax Toilet Seal, Wax-Free Toilet Bowl Gasket Fits Any Drain) rather than the included wax gasket \u2014 that turned out to be a smart move because otherwise we\u2019d have had to replace the wax gasket after the failed first try in order to ensure a watertight seal. All that being said, once the toilet was in position, it was not at all difficult to use the included wrench to reach around from behind to tighten the nuts to the bolts. The benefit, of course, is the clean look of the skirted base (and for cleaning, there's nothing better!).We\u2019d noted that some reviewers here on Amazon complained that the flush wasn\u2019t strong enough. I strongly disagree. First of all, with the toilet in use here for more than a week, we\u2019ve not found that to be an issue at all. Also, there are instructions included for how to adjust the force of the flush if necessary \u2014 we haven\u2019t had to adjust it at all, as the factory pre-settings are perfectly adequate. It\u2019s also quite quiet, and almost totally silent when the tank is refilling after a flush.As for the appearance of this new toilet, it\u2019s a great addition to our bathroom remodel, and we\u2019re very pleased. Another plus is the removable (and soft-closing!) toilet seat, which will make cleaning much, much easier. All in all, we\u2019d recommend this to anyone looking for a stylish (and SKIRTED!) toilet. As for the negative reviews here, we\u2019re glad we ignored them.",
