Good buy for the price cheaper by 20% than the bidet only product I had.",

I would try and use the handheld sprayer and where the knobs were to change the setting would have water spraying out of it all over my bathroom :(",

It is easy to install but I was didn't want to bother with that and had the handyman install it as part of a package of several other chores. I had another version without the hose sprayer one which I installed myself in my past place but this one with the hose part surpasses the other.",
