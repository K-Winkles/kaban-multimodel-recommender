                "reviewText": "BEFORE PURCHASING: I used the handy measurement graphic on the item description to ensure it fit my toilet and seat - it did. I highly suggest you do, too.IMPORTANT NOTE: I always read reviews prior to any purchase and did so with this bidet as well. I typically read a couple dozen and call it good. I didn't happen to notice the particular \"issue\" I encountered, so here it is: The item photos suggest that the spray nozzles themselves are always visible, so imagine my disappointment when I unpacked the pieces only to see............no nozzles on the bidet, just two posts where they should be! For a couple minutes I thought I had surely received a factory defective unit. After a few minutes of head scratching I assumed that they would release and extend once the water was turned on and they were pressurized by hitting one of the \"on\" buttons. I unexpectedly verified this after getting everything connected, turning the water back on, and hitting the \"on\" butt button..............with my face squarely in front of the not-yet-extended nozzles. SURPRISE! The wife got a big kick out my dripping face. STORY MORAL: don't despair - the nozzles are there.I'm not quite certain why anyone would have difficulty getting this bidet connected. The item description gives clear measurement instructions to ensure proper fitment; instructions in the box are certainly clear enough and don't entail a large number of steps; the parts were all there, the T-connector is steel, no plastic parts - no problem. I got it all connected in about 15 minutes and we were off to the races with NO LEAKS.HELPFUL HINT FROM A NON-PLUMBER: I used one, single wrap of teflon plumber's tape on each fitting that had an exposed thread (the fitting off the bottom of the toilet's water closet, one of the fittings on the T-connector, and the one on the body of the bidet itself that the water line connects to). Remember to always wrap in a clockwise direction while looking directly at the hole of the fitting! The nut fitting will screw in that direction and will appropriately seat the teflon tape as it will \"ride\" along in the direction of the nut being screwed over the taped fitting. If you put the tape on backwards, screwing on the fitting will unseat it and push the tape backward, compromising the tightness of the connection and leaving room for leaks.I just installed this yesterday, so I don't have a lot of usage to report on yet. What I can say is that once extended, the nozzles seem to be aimed perfectly based on their positioning at the very center of the toilet bowl's back edge. Make sure to line them up this way! We did dial the pressure way back to about 3 on the dial at Wifey's request. For the money, it's a quality piece, installed quickly and easily, and seems to do the job. I can't yet comment on the self-cleaning function, but will assume it won't have any issues. We are on well water with heavy iron and a fair amount of hardness in our water, so I expect we may need to replace this in several years, but for the cost of this bidet attachment, I'm almost tempted to buy a replacement NOW so all I'll need to do is just swap out the actual bidet body and won't need to disconnect/re-connect everything (other than the water line to the bidet).If you're in the market for a bidet attachment, it's worth giving this one a try. Though it's our first bidet, I'm confident saying that this one is a pretty safe bet for the relatively low cost involved. If it's YOUR first run at a bidet attachment, I doubt it gets any simpler than this.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Veken Bidet Attachment for my home, and I've been impressed with its performance and design. Here's my detailed review:1. Installation Ease: The installation process was straightforward. The instructions provided were clear, and I appreciated that no special tools were needed. It was a hassle-free setup that I managed to complete quickly.2. Design and Build Quality: The ultra-slim design of the Veken Bidet is a significant plus. It fits seamlessly with the existing toilet setup, adding a modern touch without being obtrusive. The build quality feels sturdy, ensuring that the product will last.3. Functionality: The primary function, the cold water spray, works efficiently. It provides a fresh and clean feeling with just the right amount of pressure. The self-cleaning feature of the sprayer is a convenient addition, maintaining hygiene without extra effort.4. User Experience: Using this bidet attachment has been a game-changer. It's environmentally friendly, reducing the need for toilet paper, and offers a more hygienic alternative. The simplicity of its use, with intuitive controls, makes it accessible for all family members.5. Areas for Improvement: While the overall experience is positive, I believe an option for warm water would enhance this product further. Additionally, a more detailed guide on adjusting water pressure for first-time users would be helpful.6. Final Thoughts: The Veken Bidet Attachment is a practical and sustainable addition to any bathroom. Its sleek design, ease of installation, and effective functionality make it a product I happily recommend. It gets the job done, providing an experience that is both refreshing and eco-friendly.",

                "reviewText": "Hello my fellow poopers! I wanted to wait and try this out for a bit so I had a sturdy base in which to write my review. I bought this product back on July 15th and installed it a few days later. All you need is a pair of channel locks or a crescent wrench and a screw driver. Basic tools, easy to install. Had it installed in under 15 minutes. The hoses it comes with are amazingly high quality and perfect length and fit for my toilets (I ordered 2). Had one in the chamber and ready to test drive my new purchase immediately after install. It's a little startling at first when the cold spray hits your rusty sherriff's badge, but its refreshing and leaves you feeling clean. I especially find it most handy after I've went and ate a plate of super hot food... it instantly cools the ole burning ring of fire! The pressure on this bad boy is impressive as well. It has a nice gentle cleaning, all the way up to water chiseling the left over brown crayon still stuck partially in the box! If this thing had temperature control and a air dryer, it would be absolutely amazing! But hell, for $30, you cant beat this entry level bidet. Stability, pressure, cleanliness, and easy to clean... it's a win win for the price!",
