                "reviewText": "Toilet is stylish and compact. It flushes great - with much less water than our original toilet. The glossy finish really works. We specifically ordered this toilet because it has an elongated seat but still needed it to fit in a small space. It fits really nicely and is narrower (width) than our last toilet, so we even saved some space. We replaced the handle to create a more rustic look, and it works great. FYI - The toilet ships in two parts, which we were not expecting. The two shipments should still arrive at the same time, however, in our case, the bowl was damaged in shipping, so it arrived much later than the tank. Good news is that the seller worked with us to have a replacement bowl shipped ASAP, and even got someone in the warehouse to inspect the bowl and add extra packing/padding material to the second shipment before it went out. The seller really went above and beyond to help us meet our installation deadline. And, the rep who helped us was very courteous as well. One thing to note: this item does not come with the lid (as pictured). You have to purchase that separately, but the lid was available at our local Home Depot.",
