                "reviewText": "So far so good. Installation went pretty cleanly, but like all toilets it's heavy and easier to work with in two pieces. The bolts for the tank do not look like they'll make it through the holes for the base, but once you get them started with some weight on the tank pressing down you can easily get the bolts on. I recommend a small wrench to give you lots of maneuvering room.When it was first installed it wouldn't flush correctly and the instructions said nothing about prepping it for flushing. I still haven't identified what was happening, something to do with seal for the central cannister, but it worked properly when I got to flush completely the first time. I had to apply a small bit of pressure to the central cannister until the tank would fill up. The issue hasn't come up again since my first time flushing after installation.The toilet flushes like a champ.Special note: the bowl of the toilet has a strange cavity that makes the flushing hole oblong instead of circular, I had to pickup a Korky 96-4AM plunger to fit it. Of course, I didn't discover this until an unrelated issue to the toilet caused a minor backup in the sewer line near where the toilet sits. A normal plunger wouldn't create a seal in the opening and is useless.",

                "reviewText": "I hate low-flow toilets for two reasons. The first reason is that most have a tendency to clog far too easily. The second is that I live on an island. In a wet and rainy area. Millions of gallons of water flow past my house every year on their way to the sea. Being told by greenies and government that my using half as much water per flush is going to save some drought-stricken corner of the country not even connected to our water table is insulting.I had to get rid of my old low-flow toilet because it was too low and clogged every other time someone used it. It was embarassing and uncomfortable. I got this one and had a plumber change it out. So far, there has only been one time a plunger needed to be applied. Some people commented on the potential for a regular plunger to not work because of the shape of the train in the Kohler models. If the clog were severe enough, perhaps, but the one incident so far cleared up with less effort than the almost daily fight with the old toilet. Since I haven't changed, that means the difference is in the hardware. I would definately recomment this one.",

                "reviewText": "I really love the new toilet. It's a few inches higher than a standard toilet which is what I was searching for. I also had to purchase the seat separately. That being said, the toilet makes a high pitched noise when the tank fills, a screeching. I contacted the manufacturer about replacement parts and received no response, so now have the cost of a plumber to add to the total purchase price. Frankly, it's poor business practice and I'm disappointed in Kohler.Update: The plumber just left and it will cost me another $160 plus the $75 I was charged today to replace the Fluidmaster. Including the seat, I'm now spending a whopping $600 on this new toilet. And just changed my rating to 1 Star.",

                "reviewText": "I've just had my bathroom renovated. Although I haven't quite committed to a bidet yet, I wanted a toilet that could handle one being installed at a later date so it needed to be elongated. I also wanted one that doesn't clog easily, and research said this one was good in that regard. Not that my old short round toilet clogged very often, but I still wanted to reduce the amount.The toilet came quickly, well packaged, and in good condition. One of the mould-holes under the lid is extra big, which shouldn't affect anything. Though when I was showing that to my husband he ran his finger over it and gashed open his fingertip on a sharp bit of ceramic, so be cautious.The flush is a bit startling. It's an abrupt loud thump as all the water falls away in a second or two. Hopefully the force of it won't knock any pipes askew. The refill is fast and quiet, no long minute of hissing like my old toilet had. Height wise, I wish I hadn't gone for \"comfort height.\" I have long legs but can't firmly plant both feet on the floor without the back of my thighs getting pressed hard enough to cut off circulation. Maybe as I get ever more decrepit I'll appreciate the easier standing up but for now I miss my lower seat.Speaking of the seat, as other reviewers have noted this doesn't come with one. Probably seat styles are such an individual taste that it's easier and less wasteful not to include one with every toilet. I asked my contractor to get one and I wasn't picky (since it's not hard to replace later) so long as it fit and had a closed loop rather than the front gap some seats have. The one he bought does fit, very precisely, so this is clearly a standard size elongated toilet.",
