                "reviewText": "Wow! We are pleasantly surprised that it hasn\u2019t clogged, especially with how little water it uses! Even the \u201cSerial Clogger\u201d in our house has not plugged this tiny toilet, stating \u201cIt must be really well engineered!\u201dWe originally bought this toilet as it was the only one that was in stock and would fit in our small space (we needed a shallow depth/not long one so we could still be able to open the bathroom door). It was a bit risky as we have never heard of the brand, but we didn\u2019t have another choice. We had a professional plumber install it, and they didn\u2019t seem to have any problems.I will admit that the inside of the bowl looks intimidatingly small, like it won\u2019t be able to pass anything other than a child-sized BM. Shockingly it has handled all it has been dropped in one flush. ONE FLUSH!The height seems fine, not short not tall, but average. The overall look of it is on the modern side and the porcelain is bright white (If I had a choice, it would have been for something less modern looking and less bright white). The one-piece design of it makes it super easy to clean.**My only gripe is the flimsy plastic toilet seat. It makes the whole thing seem much cheaper than it should. Oh well.It\u2019s mean to flush poop and pee and it does all of that like a champ!",

It is perfect for small spaces, it looks terrific and it was easy to install. Horow customer service is also first rate, with quick responses to questions and a willingness to work with you in the event of difficulty. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another of these or any other toilets or accessories from Horow if the need ever arose.",

                "reviewText": "it's small but tall enough, 16.5 inches not including the seat. I like the seat. you can remove the seat completely and it is slow to close, both the lid and seat. Standard toilet fluid master fill valve will fit, plush valve appears proprietary but it good so far. It was easy enough to set like I have always set a toilet, wax ringson floor, bolts in, double nutted, then hover the toilet over the bolts and set it down on the wax. Functions perfectly so far. Tightening closet bolts was NO PROBLEM just use an open end wrench. No need to cover the closet bolts as there is access covers that easily cover the hole where you tighten the closet bolts down.______One month later... Perfect toilet after using it NOT EVEN ONE CLOG. Have not had to use the plunger.My local supply house did not have a 10 inch to wall toilet, it was to be a special order. So I found this toilet and it looks nice, glazed inside and out. No flaws seen and I looked for them. I have installed hundreds of toilets in both commercial and residential locations but this one is for me and it's terrific. The toilet seat can be completely removed by pressing a button, it just comes off and can be installed after cleaning just as quickly.Finish, packing of product, price, function, AVAILABILITY!Wish it was USA made.",
