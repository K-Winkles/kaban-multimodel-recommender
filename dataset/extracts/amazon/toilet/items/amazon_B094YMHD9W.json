We had a bidet that got under the toilet seat for a couple years and I got tired of how impossible it was to clean everything thoroughly. It was so gross when I took it off, so happy to get rid of it. I love that this is interested into the seat and will be so much easier to keep clean. Installation was straightforward. The knob to use is easy and works well. It aims better than my last one too. Thank you bidet stealth!!",

                "reviewText": "My mom in law bought a Brondell bidet and I bought the Genie about a week apart. I installed both and like the Genie significantly more. The Genie has a good slow close lid which stays open when the lid is lifted. The Brondell lid didn\u2019t stay open. The Genie looks like a real toilet seat with the attachment point readily accessible for cleaning. The Brondell lid has a bulky attachment that covers the attachments and has a button on the side that allows you to remove the seat easily. It doesn\u2019t help for cleaning because the attachment is a large piece of plastic that crosses both seat attachment points. Also, the Brondell leaked and took significant effort to stop the leak. The Genie requires no plumbers tape and had no leaks. Finally, the Genie bidet portion has a detent on the knob for turning off the water, the Brondell required me to feel when the water stopped. Overall, after 2 weeks of regular use, I like the Genie a lot. It is pretty easy to install, has never leaked, the seat feels like a good mid range toilet seat regardless of the bidet feature and I like how the knob turns the water off and on. It is smooth and doesn\u2019t feel cheap. One other thing, I have not found I need heated water which surprised me until I tried my mom in laws. I would buy this bidet again and highly recommend it.",

It fit my Kohler High Arc toilet perfectly. I Like that it has a metal shut off valve and water supply line included. Only used twice so far but works well and very powerful stream, once you remember to remove piece of tape over nozzle\ud83d\ude06. 2 things I wish it had are quick removal to clean under it and a lid strong enough to sit on.",
