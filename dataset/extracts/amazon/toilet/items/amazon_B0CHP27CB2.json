Easy to install (I added a shutoff valve so that when my young grandkids visit, they don't turn it on and walk away!) and very easy to use! Because there are no knobs, sitting for \"larger\" persons is very comfortable! So happy, bought for all our bathrooms!",

                "reviewText": "This was a great purchase. I bought this to put in our guest bathroom, as we already have a different one in our master bathroom. I am so impressed with this, I might switch it out with the one in the master bathroom. Firstly, the design of this bidet is aesthetically pleasing. I love the metal trim. It looks sleek and stylish. Being slim, it sits almost flush on the toilet seat. It almost looks like it is an original part of the toilet seat.I like the up and down lever to change the direction/flow of the water stream. It feels more natural to use than the other types. I think I have better control of the water stream.This bidet was also a breeze to install. It looked intimidating at first, but only took around 15-20 minutes to install. It is simply a matter of disassembling the toilet seat and connecting the included hoses in two places.Unlike some of the other ones I have used, this bidet came with a metal hose and connectors. I can tell it will last a long time.This thing is powerful and accurate. Might even be too powerful for first-time bidet users. However, this can easily be adjusted. In the past, I have had to either adjust my sitting posture or change the angle of the stream a bit to get it right. This one is precise enough to not have to do any of that. Also, you can easily adjust the pressure based on your preference. This is easily done using the swivel lever.It looks more premium than what it is. For the price, you get an excellent bidet that will hopefully also last a long time.",

Although I would love if the water was heated, I didn\u2019t want to have to hire a contractor to connect a hot water connection. After ordering and installing my first one, I immediately ordered another one for my master bathroom. Would wholeheartedly recommend.",
