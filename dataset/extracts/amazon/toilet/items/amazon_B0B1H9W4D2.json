I had to return other ones because for the smaller toilets, it's just not a compatible fit.",

                "reviewText": "We installed the LUXE Bidet NEO 185 Plus, replacing our Luxe Bide Neo Elite that we have had since 2018 or 5 years. This new model has hinges allowing you to swing up the bidet piece to clean behind the nozzle area which to be honest, I had not been able to clean very well in those 5 years with the Neo Elite, since I could not get a toilet brush back there and I tried to clean with a paper towel and cleaner. With this 185 Plus, I am able to raise the toilet seat then the bidet and hold up the bidet attachment to clean behind the nozzle area with a toilet brush. We have a longer, older Universal-Rundle 1.6 gpf toilet.The controls looks more rectangular than the Elite and the Plus knobs have more edges than the Elite. Although I miss the softer curved lines on the Elite, I have gotten used to edges that might allow for better grip and turning.Installation time took less than 15 minutes to take out our old Elite and replace it with the Plus, not including the time to empty the toilet tank. Having a small glass with straight edges helped with emptying the water as did a washcloth to soak up the water. We probably did not have to do such a thorough job, just make sure water is below the outtake area. A small towel will also be helpful when you disconnect the water hose. The bidet comes with a good instruction book, parts, and a plastic wrench. You will need a large flathead screwdriver to unscrew your toilet lid.Even having had the 185 Neo Elite, you will need to replace the water supply hose and T-adapter with the ones provided in the kit. The Plus uses a standard 3/8\" fitting. Previously for the Elite, we had to buy a special T-adapter to get the original Neo Elite to fit. The company may have provided one if we contacted them, but we had bought it from Amazon. For the Plus, the hose is 7/8\" to connect up to the water tank while the end that connect with the bidet is 3/8\".We replaced both our Elite bidets in one day and found it easier to:1. Turn off the water and mostly empty the toilet tank2. Take off the toilet seat and old bidet. It will give you more room to access the pipes on the left.3. Replace and connect up the new hose and T-adapter4. Put the new bidet on and then the toilet seat over it. We did not change out the previous hinge covers from the Elite bidet.5. Screw the pieces gently together6. Have a woman sit on the toilet and see if the feminine and bottom wash spray are coming out to spray the right areas. If not adjust the bidet position.The 185 Plus bidet spray come out more as a good, strong spray and less of the Elite's penatrating, directed stream of water which used to result in a loop of having to go to the bathroom again, spraying to clean and having to go again, etc. I am happier with the way the 185 Plus sprays. The 185 Plus includes the self-cleaning feature allowing water to wash over the nozzles. The controls and the way the knobs work are the same for the Elite and the Plus, so there is no learning curve. The knob farthest out controls the water pressure, turn this one slowly. The knob closest to the tank adjusts from feminine wash (to the far left), normal wash (middle), and nozzle self-clean (far right).As I mentioned, we have been using the Luxe Bidet Neo Elite series since 2018 and have been very pleased with them. We had two that we installed in our house, we liked them so much. I had bought a replacement knob in 2022 from the company since the inner plastic part which kept it in place had broken off. They arrived quickly. In 2023, I was sent an e-mail from Luxe Bidet, since I had left a 5 star Amazon review on the Elite in 2018, they offered me a 10% discount toward a new Luxe Bidet Plus and up to $50 refund check for my Elite bidet. I ordered the new Luxe Bidet Plus, provided the Amazon order information, and they sent me a $50 check even though the original Elite did not cost $50.I am really happy to get this new model, so I can clean behind the nozzle area. Also, in the 5 years, the bottom of the old Elite nozzles had gotten rather dirty even with the protective door cover. I know I did not do the self cleaning as often as I should. Periodically, I would also use cleaner and paper towel to clean them off more.I am delighted to have the new LUXE Bidet NEO 185 Plus and know I will get many cleaner years from this newer model. These bidets really help you feel much cleaner with less work and stretching to get all the areas and saves a ton of toilet paper. I was most grateful to have the bidet during the great COVID-19 Toilet Paper Shortage of 2020.",

Savings in toilet paper use will pay for this device in a month or two. The wear and tear on the sewer system is obvious. Health and hygiene are increased. The fact it has no warm water connection or control is a non- factor. I thought it would be, but it's not. I've used it when it's below 20 degrees outside, early in the morning and it is very comfortable. I recommend it very, very highly.",
