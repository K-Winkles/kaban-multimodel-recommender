The units work well and we like them (except for the one that started leaking). Hopefully there will be no more leaks.",

There was a deal and I got it for a good price and honestly installation took all of 10 minutes. I for sure thought that the cold was going to be the worst thing ever and I was going to hate it but I got it for my husband and honestly I love it. The cold is barely noticeable it's a little bit of a ohh moment and that's it. We've had it for 2 months now and it's had no issues a lot of reviews have said that there's leakage at this point and we are free and clear thus far. We also check and make sure everything is staying appropriately seal and situated correctly every couple of days because I'm paranoid. It's so easy to use that all three of my children use it and we've had a massive decrease in toilet paper which being a family of five we went through a lot. I used to have to buy toilet paper every week and now I'm buying it every 3 weeks. For information purposes I have no storage in my house so I can't bulk buy",

                "reviewText": "Europe has used the bidet even before they developed the toilet! Once you use it, you'll wonder how you ever got clean \"down there\" without it. Plus it saves a lot on toilet paper, as you will discover.This is a current model of an old one I had from the same company. The previous one lasted 7 years. It began leaking around the control panel and I could not find a replacement feed line anywhere as the gasket used was fused onto the feed line.I've used this newer model for several months now and it operates every bit as well as the original. It does have two \"modes\" one that supposedly sprays the water further toward the front of you (I suppose for the ladies) and the other which is directed directly at your bottom. There is also a knob to adjust the water pressure.This beats paying hundreds of dollars to install a real Bidet, or paying over $100 for a complete bidet toilet seat. The water is NOT heated, but that's not a problem where we live in south Texas as ever the cold water is usually warm due to the heat here 9 months of the year.So far, no leaks or problems and I expect to get another 7 or maybe more years from this model.",

                "reviewText": "My experience with the Veken Bidet Attachment has been nothing short of a plumbing nightmare. What was promised as a convenient addition to my bathroom turned into a watery disaster.Upon installation, the bidet seemed promising with its adjustable pressure control. However, the reality was far from what I expected. The supposed \"self-cleaning\" feature turned out to be a facade, as the nozzles were prone to clogging, leading to unsanitary conditions.Moreover, the bidet's \"non-electric\" claim should come with a warning. The water temperature was absolutely frigid, providing a shocking surprise each time I attempted to use it. It was less of a refreshing cleanse and more of an Arctic plunge.Worst of all, within days of installation, the bidet attachment began leaking profusely, causing water to pool around the base of the toilet. It felt like Niagara Falls decided to relocate to my bathroom! Not only did this create a mess, but it also risked damaging my flooring.The \"feminine wash\" nozzle, touted for its specialized functionality, was anything but gentle. Instead of a gentle spray, it felt like a high-pressure hose, leaving me feeling more uncomfortable than before.To add insult to injury, customer support was virtually non-existent. Attempts to reach out for assistance were met with silence, leaving me stranded with a malfunctioning bidet.In conclusion, the Veken Bidet Attachment was a catastrophic addition to my bathroom experience. From its faulty design leading to leaks and poor functionality to the bone-chilling water temperature and lackluster customer service, this product has been nothing short of a plumbing nightmare.",
