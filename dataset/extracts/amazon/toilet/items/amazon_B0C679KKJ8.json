She lives in a very old building that there is not enough space between the wall and the toilet sewer line unless cutting off a piece of the wall (impossible). The contractor tried all the tricks nothing worked. The toilet is so big and heavy that she was not even able to return it to the seller. Amazon was kind enough to refund our money without returning the item, and the contractor was kind enough to hall it away for us without charge. Thank God! The lesson to lean for future buyers: measure the space between the wall the toilet sewer line before buying !!!!!!!",
