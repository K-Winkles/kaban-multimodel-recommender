                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. So, I got this for myself for Christmas and was SO EXCITED to try it. It was easy to install, I know some people have complained about it not being bolted down...but it is so heavy, does not move, and has not been a problem at all. However, after installing the toilet it unfortunately did not work. It just would not flush. We would hit the flush button and the water would just swirl and not go down. I contacted the seller and they emailed me back right away with three things to try:1. Make sure the filter on the toilet was clean.2. Make sure none of the lines were pinched during installation3. If you have a home incoming water filter, make sure it is clean.Now, I won't lie, I didn't think it would make a difference but we checked 1 and 2...no change. We went to Loews and purchased a new home filter.....and believe it or not IT WORKED. If you watch the video and see the flush now...just imagine when we pressed the flush button before a little water swirled but it didn't even flush the toilet paper down.Side note: We had noticed (before purchase) a water pressure change, like when using the toilet ...the shower pressure would drop. We had NO IDEA that the filter affected the water pressure that much. Turns out it does, because our water pressure is now back to normal.Positives: I love the light, warm seat, bidet, and that the seat opens as I walk into the bathroom. My mom came over and tried it and liked it so much she is now getting one too. I have contacted customer service over four times, and they have gotten back to me right away each time.Negatives: The only negative I will give it is the beeping. It beeps when the lid opens, when you get up, when you flush...etc... This can be annoying if you are sleeping (I'm a light sleeper) and it wakes you up. I did contact them and they said there is no way to turn off the beep. I'm not taking any stars away for this b/c I did read the reviews before I purchased and knew about it already.",

                "reviewText": "We absolutely love everything about this truly smart toilet.Easy to install, I did it by myself in less than 30 minutes, although I recommend 2 people to lift and position it because at 100lb, it can be quite heavy for one person.All functions are as described,except for the display that can only show temperature settings in Celcius. This could be a bit confusing for US customers.There is also another automated function that does not appear in the instructions manual which comes with the unit, however the company customer service helped me to get it setup and functioning very quickly.Specifically this is \"Auto Flush\" after a Male Standup business.To set this up, you must first power the toilet off with the button on its remote .You then have to press and hold the \"cover close\" button (located on the LEFT of the circle on remote), until you hear a beep. One beep means function is ON and 2 beeps means function is OFF.So with auto flushing after Male Standup or Sitting Down, this is a fully functional smart toilet.The bidet functions also work great and we both love the heated dry function.Bottom line is that this smart toilet offers everything and I can't think of any other function that it does not provide, other than perhaps an \"auto foam\" feature which we have on our guest room smart toilet, but that one is also a little more expensive than this unity because of its foam feature.Great smart toilet which I can confidently recommend to anyone.",

                "reviewText": "After spending $200 to install this toliet because it does not align to toilet standards, I soon discovered that the seat warmer stopped working. The remote control often requires you to push buttons 2-3 times before it activates. There must be something wrong with the auto-seat lifting because I hear the toliet seat go up and down during the night even though there has been no motive near the toilet. Also the washing arm turns off if you move at all. Would be nice if it had an isolation mode since you cannot move while using the bidet otherwise it turns off. I would not recommend this toilet.",

I personally was not comfortable installing it without a way to secure it to the flange so I reached out to customer service and they refunded me. 5 stars for the great customer service as well as the quality build of the toilet. It\u2019s just unfortunate that there is no way to secure it to the flange with bolts like most toilets here in the US",

Love the fact it opens up automatically, has a foot control for men, flushes automatically and has a warm seat. Love the bidet function as well. You can stop using toilet paper as it will wash and dry for your comfort. Only thing I wish was different is I wish the lid would close before the automatic flush instead of afterward.",
