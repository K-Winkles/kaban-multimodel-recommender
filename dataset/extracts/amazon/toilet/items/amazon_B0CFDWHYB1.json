It took me 5mins to get the bidet installed and there\u2019s no leakage occur since I\u2019ve used it. I especially liked the holder design, it makes it even easier for the bidet to be secured. It\u2019s convenient and it just makes life easier. Very satisfied with this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "GuiMemi Handheld Bidet Sprayer for Toilet Bidet Sprayer Premium Stainless Steel Jet Sprayer for Toilet Water Sprayer Handheld Bidet Perfect for Whole Family Cleaning UseGood quality, but wrong size for U.S. (not 7/8\")I've installed these on previous toilets, so I expected this installation to be a breeze, but I was surprised to find the T-valve wasn't the right size for my toilet. This sent me down a rabbit hole of researching plumbing parts, particularly what that valve sticking out of the friggen toilet is actually called. So I found that US toilets typically have a 7/8\" valve, which is an uncommon size in general for most other parts. I ended up having to buy a separate T-valve, which cost half of what this package retails for. Once it was all put together, it worked great!If you haven't used one before, it's best practice to keep the valve in the off position when it's not being used to reduce pressure on the hose and prevent any leaks. I've never had a leak, but I've always kept mine turned off when not in use. These tend to have very high pressure, but the handle is pressure sensitive, so go easy when you press it until you have it to the desired pressure. These are handy little devices - in addition to use as a bidet, they're also great for cleaning the toilet bowl (be careful of splashback), diapers or other soiled clothes, and the bathroom sink, or shower, or bathtub if they can reach.This bidet seems very high quality and I believe the size I received would fit most European fixtures. It's possible the issue has been addressed, since the listing now shows a 7/8\" size, which I don't remember seeing before, but it would be a good idea to check with the seller before purchasing.(submitted 11/22/2023)",

But simply a hose that you can attach to the side of your toilet, so you can clean yourself and clean the toilet as well. It's solidly constructed, easy to assemble, easy to attach to the toilet, and easy to use. As a point of personal preference, I also like it because it has a matte finish as opposed to a glossy finish. 10/10 would buy again.",

There is a lever with which you can close off the sprayer. That is convenient if you have curious little children that might want to play with the sprayer and hose down your bathroom. You can hang the hook on your toilet tank to hang up the sprayer to avoid putting holes in your wall or cabinet. Personally, I like to hang the sprayer on the cabinet to avoid twisting around to reach it. This bidet sprayer has a wonderful, heavy weight feel and a nice looking quality. The colors of the metal do not match perfectly. This is very easy to install. This sprayer is an excellent quality sprayer. The water that comes out is, of course, simply cold water. If you are afraid that you won\u2019t be able to stand the cold water, don\u2019t be. It is not a big deal and for short time you use it, it is easily tolerated. I wish I could turn back time and install these after having my children. This would make an excellent gift for a new mother!",
