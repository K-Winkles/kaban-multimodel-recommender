However, if you take the cushion off and just use the flat part with the pegs in the holes, that gives you 1/16\" buffer. The adhesive ones last about a week then you just fish them out of the toilet and go on down the road. Good hand washing, always. No one asked me for my opinion on these so I finally volunteered it.",
