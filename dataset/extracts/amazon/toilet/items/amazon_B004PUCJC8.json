                "reviewText": "I am very upset. For my bathroom remodeling project, I just spent 3 weeks to identify a Kohler powerflush toilet with a flushmate swish sound to replace my Kohler power flush. This product was misrepresented. It is NOT a power flush. It is NOT a high, handicap toilet. There was not any toilet seat even though the product photo displays a seat. I was tricked.I am pissed.",

                "reviewText": "6-26-2018 You have to see the entry from the Kohler customer service rep. to know why it changed from a one star to a five star review!!It looks like I'm the only one who thinks this toilet should go back to the design board. First of all, they went from 1.6 to a 1.2 gallon flush. It's become a spritz flush. The design of the toilet has solid waste deposited on the porcelain portion of the bowl, just before the water. The flush is adequate if all waste matter ends up in the water, but since human beings are shaped differently than horses, it doesn't. It then takes multiple flushes to clean the bowl because there is not enough water to rinse the inside of the bowl. The 1.2 gallons are 95% directed to an immediate flush and not bowl rinse. Bad design. Buy one and you'll know what I'm talking about. Be forewarned. Don't buy this toilet or any 1.2 gallon spritz flush design for that matter!",

                "reviewText": "You can get many Kohler toilets in the $200 to $250 dollar range but I needed a 10 inch rough in which are hard to find. For over $400 You would think it would come with a seat like most do, especially if they are going to have a seat on the toilet in the item photo. Also does not come with wax ring or installation bolts. Customer service told me it was supposed to come with bolts and shipped me the caps that go over the bolts instead. After several days of back and forth communications, she finally decided that the bolts don't come with the tiolet and I would have to purchase some. Nice toilet, but should come with everything all the toilets at the big box stores come with, and picture should be updated to just show a bowl and tank because that is all you get.",
