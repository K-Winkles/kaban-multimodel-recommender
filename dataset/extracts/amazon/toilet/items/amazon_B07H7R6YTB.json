                "reviewText": "What a fantastic product!Installation: super simple (it comes basically fully assembled) but I definitely recommend having professional help, if nothing else, for the smell blast you'll get on removing the existing toilet.Functionality: on point. It has pretty much everything one would want from a smart toilet.Design: the optimal mix of classic and modern. The night light is a great feature (although it's either OFF, or always ON, disregarding whether the unit is in use or not. I'd think it should only be ON while the unit is in use, like as the lid opens up)Quality: everything looks and feels solid, sturdy, beautiful.Price: the most competitive, and it's a USA brand!Remote control: great functionality. A neat feature I wasn't aware of before purchasing, the remote snaps to the wall mount thanks to a pair of hidden magnets on it. It's a super nifying feature! (Also, it has 2 hidden screws, if you need to install it in a place open to the public, like an office or business), to secure the remote for loss prevention.This thing has fulfilled my expectations in spades.The only thing I would love to see in a future version is some way to have a hands-free lid and seat opening for standing male use. All smart toilets I've researched, only open the lid, but not the toilet seat, so that demands an extra button push. But this is getting picky, I know :)",

I installed it myself, and because the original connection was turned by 1/2\u201d it does lead to a challenge getting the toilet straight. If the rough is done correctly, one of the easiest installs ever. Regarding usage, we have had this installed for over a year and it has been a success with all the friends. They have all asked for the link. We love the heated seat, it\u2019s easy to clean, and I particularly like the low water level which makes for a better \u201cMale\u201d experience. There\u2019s a battle for default being lift both lids or just one. I am notorious for clogging toilets, hence my affection for Toto. This Woodbridge has been near flawless with only one occasion where it clogged. We used the universal rubber gasket instead of a was gasket. I was concerned, but it has performed flawlessly and we have hardwood floors to boot. Thumbs up as a Cost/Value option. I am unlikely to purchase a competition at 5 to 8 times the cost, we are installing 2 more next month.",

                "reviewText": "I got one of these and it worked great for about a year and half. Then the lid didn't open anymore. After a few calls to support, they said they would send me out a new lid mechanism. I though they forgot as some weeks had gone by, then a whole new toilet showed up. I guess they were out of the lids so they sent me a whole new unit. I was able to swap out the lid portion and it works great again. Only features that I'm not a fan of is that there is no way to disable to charcoal filter fan that always runs when you sit down, and that the LCD display on the remote requires you to look at it at a specific angle to see the text. I would definitely buy again",

                "reviewText": "We bought this toilet 3 years ago and were really happy with it for the most part. It works well, has as many features as the fancy totos for a lot less, nice look etc. but it has 2 annoying issues I am hating so much now.#1 when you go # 2 in this is will almost always smack on this ledge they have in the bowl, never the water. The toilet hardly keeps any water in it and to hit the water you would have to aim with far more intent than I ever want to when going to the bathroom. Result is crap smeared remains almost every time you use it even after the flush does its job, so you are cleaning up with a brush almost every time.#2 the major one. YOU CAN NOT REPLACE THE SEAT ITSELF. After using it every day the shine starts to wear and/or if you are unlucky like us it will leach up pigment from clothing over the years and the color will change. Over the pandemic we were home and using it a lot more often, result was our seat started to change colors from wearing whatever we were wearing. I called the company to ask about getting a new seat because it looked bad now. They replied that you can not pop out that piece, you have to buy the whole entire seat bidet system again for $500 just to get that seat. $500 are you kidding me? Also I do not see an easy way to replace the piece or remove it, so I would also have to call a plumber to make the swap most likely.If you have kids, or do replace your seat every few years as it gets worn please reconsider this one, because you are stuck with it till you want to pay another $500. I have attached a photo to show just how bad the color changes. I dont even wear denim!",
