                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Easy installation, push button use.",
                "reviewText": "This unit comes very well packaged and sealed. It is extremely lightweight and has minimal parts. The base that attaches to the top of the toilet bowl, beneath the seat attachment, has a positive locking mechanism to firmly secure the unit to your toilet and it can be unlocked to remove it for cleaning without disassembling your toilet seat situation all over again.My package did not contain the washer that instructions state should be included, but those are very inexpensive and readily available at my local hardware store so I'm not concerned with that. You may also wish to pick up an additional roll of Teflon tape for sealing all of the connections, depending on your skill with applying said tape and potentially running part of it before you're able to get everything assembled. Just a heads up there. Teflon tape is also very inexpensive and easy to get so I'm also not concerned with that.The button operation is really easy to operate. Buttons depress and release with little force needed. The dial is easy for me to operate as well, but if you have a disability or condition that very negatively affects your finger dexterity and/or grip capacity you may wish to consider a different style of unit.The instructions for installing are very straight forward if you have any experience assembling things. Even if this is your first time assembling or installing something like this, there are pictures included with the numbered, written instructions to make them easy to follow.",

                "reviewText": "This thing is grrreat! My whole family uses it and have three other families using this too. Super easy to install, comes with everything you need, self cleaning nozzles, easy to use buttons( dumb dumb proof). With my arm in a sling currently this has saved me A LOT of trouble. The cool water doesn\u2019t bother at all, in fact we all find it refreshing( it\u2019s more like room temp). It\u2019s more sanitary then other things we\u2019ve used like wet wipes and saves soooo much money on other things like expensive toilet paper( as we only use to dry a bit.) our toddler even uses it lol this thing is great. I very rarely write reviews unless I feel strongly about something\u2026 I feel strongly this will help a lot of people and after searching and reviewing and finally buying and using this bidet I have to speak up so others can enjoy this bidet( unbeatable price right now too). It\u2019s sized just right by the way, others look like a giant science potty project that you need an engineering degree to install and use! Just buy it\u2026 lol! You\u2019ll love it and feel what all of us feel.",
