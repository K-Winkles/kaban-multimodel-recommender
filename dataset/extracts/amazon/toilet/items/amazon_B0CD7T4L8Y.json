It appears to be able to flush without any problems and I believe our next water utility bill will reflect the improved efficiency of this technology. I am a little confused as to why you sent a variety of tank attachment bolts, washers, and nuts. Your directions did not show what the best combination of bolts, washers, and nuts were preferred.",

                "reviewText": "Great packing and quick shipping. When needing a 10\" rough in, it's pretty slim pickings and usually not in stock a local stores. If you do find one, it has limited features. Often without a seat. Then it's like...good luck finding just the right seat to perfectly fit the bowl. This toilet is good looking and has all the features I was looking for....and the only toilet that did at a decent price. Soft close seat, too.",
