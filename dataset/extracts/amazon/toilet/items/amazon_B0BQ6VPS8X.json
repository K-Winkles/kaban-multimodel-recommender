I ordered three of these, and the plumber told me at first he was worried they would be difficult to install, but then told me they were easy, they had large enough openings to install easily with plenty of room, and did I mention how beautiful they are? I love the soft close lids as well. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Got this toilet right in time! The toilet that came with the house was starting to leak and show signs of damage around the seat. Order this toilet and it arrived very quickly all I would peace, no pun intended. Contrary the standard toilets, the setup is very simple and can be done with one person but would benefit another to hand off tools and supplies while fixing the toilet over the flange. This tank connects to the seat and reduces grinding of the two parts against each other over time. It also prevents build up of bacteria underneath where the two sections meet. You can see in the video how slowly this closes, a great Advantage for those who live with residents who have a tendency to let the toilet seat slam down. No longer have to worry about the sudden slamming of the porcelain on the seat!The only thing I would be wary of is checking the instructions and making sure that this will fit your previous flange and pipe fittings in the ground. This has a slightly irregular size cup area that connects to the fittings on on the floor, at least compared to the previous toilet. There are Universal adapters you can buy in case of such a problem, or just be sure to install this toilet in a newly built bathroom to avoid any sort of extra purchases. No issues with flushing or the tank itself, and it works incredibly well four different varied amounts of waste being flushed down.",
