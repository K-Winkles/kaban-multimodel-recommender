                "reviewText": "There is absolutely no better toilet on the market than Toto. I've installed and used them all. Really, no comparison. The quality of the flush is second to none. If you're on the fence, get off it and get the Toto. Stop wasting your money on the cheap box store stuff. Buy once, cry once.In full transparency, I did NOT receive this toilet as part of a promotion or paid review. I bought it with my own money, paying full freight.I had to write a review to voice my complete satisfaction with the seller, Home Essentials. The first order I made had the bowl arrive shattered in the box, but the tank was fine. I immediately contacted Home Essentials and informed them of what happened, and offered to send everything back. I received a reply within an hour telling me they needed to check a couple of things on their end to determine what the best approach would be to get me a replacement. I offered to send pictures. They took my word for it. About 8 hours later, I received an e-mail telling me to keep the good tank, throw out the shattered bowl and they would be refunding my money in full, and that I was welcome to place another order with them. I did exactly that. The new toilet arrived priority and was well packed this time to protect in shipping. Everything was perfect.In this day, you cannot ask for any better customer service. A+ all the way around. I will 100% be ordering another one from them.",

                "reviewText": "What can I say: Its a Toto which is a reliable brand. It replaced an old toilet with old technology which dumped a ton of water that circled around and around forever before emtpying the bowl. The Toto has a 1.6 and 1.2 gallon option dependent upon how long you hold the handle down to flush. It flushes fast and effectively and looks good doing it. If I had any complaint its that they shorted me on a couple of washers for the tank which was no big deal as I repurposed them from the previous tank.I'm adding an addendum to this review. I can't find this toilet anywhere on the Toto website nore can I find replacement parts for it. There is a universal fill valve that will probably work but the drain valve is exactly that as opposed to a flapper design and I can't find it anywhere. I'll update when I get more information by calling Toto",

                "reviewText": "Toto makes great toilets, I've had them before and sure this one would have been great as well. The trick is getting it delivered without being broken. You'd think there would be better packaging on these, and it would also help if those handling it used common sense and wouldn't toss around a package that clearly states toilet on the outside of the box. On top of that, Amazon doesn't offer a replacement. You have to return then re-order, and now the price has increased since my order.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered two of these. My plumber fussed at the brand and it turned out one of them had a broken part inside the tank. The other was installed without issue. Toto was very helpful talking me through testing the broken part, then sending me a new one, which was easy to replace. I was happy with the customer service I received and I am very happy with the look and function of these toilets. I like how they flush and (where the water flows into the toilet....which is different than any toilet I have used before). I knocked a star off for the trouble of having a non-working toilet while I waited for a replacement part. And, I do wonder if I will regret these toilets when other parts need to be replaced and reordered vs. running to the box stores to quickly buy a replacement part. My plumber may not be wrong about the hassle or extra cost of that. Still, I replaced a third toilet with another brand and do not like it as much as these.",

It\u2019s just amazing to see this toilet in action, I am downright giggly about it!",
