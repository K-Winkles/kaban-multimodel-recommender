                "reviewText": "A superior toilet minimizes the need for a plunger and a brush. The Toto toilet flushes very well making plunging a rare event. However, some waste deposits can cling to the under water surfaces requiring multiple flushes or a brush to remove them. The toilet flush also seems louder than others, but this is probably necessary for the superior flushing. Components in the tank appear to be high quality which is good as replacements are unlikely to be found at your local hardware store. Very glad I bought it but it is not a 5 star product.",

The rear of the base sits considerably closer to the wall and existing water valve, which may make cleaning behind it a challenge, however, the overall look of the toilet is neat and clean.Be aware that the wax ring and bolts are not included.The toilet flushes smoothly and efficiently, so much better than the 30 year old one it replaced and the bowl seems to stay clean.",
