                "reviewText": "I rarely write reviews, but I've had 3 other bidet attachments and this is by far the best for so cheap! I can't believe our luck. The others we've had get really dirty and are super hard to clean - this one, not the case. I did install it differently than the directions (I removed the toilet screws and put it on in reverse in order for the lid to shut properly), but other than that, it was easy to install. The pressure is really good - all my other ones were too forceful right off the bat. I like that the self-cleaning function happens first in whatever direction you turn it (this prevents my kids from turning it on and immediately getting sprayed in the face) and is more sanitary. I will be replacing my very expensive Tushy bidet with one of these next time we have to remove it for cleaning or if it breaks.",

                "reviewText": "With so many 5 star ratings I expected a better product. The handle that controls the water is a good design but the rest not so much. Easy install but the product is garbage.Defect 1 - Two plastic pieces making the base do not fit together properly and pop out easily. After installation they came apart and won't go back in anymore.Defect 2 - When I tried to put the two pieces back together the small very thin plastic flap behind the nozzle housing snapped off.Defect 3 - Used the posterior cleaner twice and then it decided not work. On the 3rd use it hardly has any pressure and water barely dribbles out, meanwhile the feminine wash works fine.Defect 4 - Few days after the install it started a small leak that drips occasionally.I would not trust this poor product. I can just imagine it starting a huge leak when I'm not around. I ordered a Delta to replace it. I would trust the Delta brand over this one.",

                "reviewText": "I am a skilled installer but it took a little tweaks to understand it.-the bidet to mounting plate latch will not click into place without physically pushing the slider. Install and push slider before you mount in case there is some binding. It is meant to release so that you can clean but I may not be doing that since it didn't easily slide over once it is mounted and screwed down with a seat.-I have an elongated bowl and the seat itself has a little rim around the bottom. When I initially installed the bidet the lid will not close due to it hitting this lower seat rim. The rotating mounting discs had to be rotated 180\u00b0 so that it allowed the bidet to be pushed All the Way back relative to the seat. I know some have complained about the seat no longer sitting flat. I think it will if it is adjusted in this manner.-the aiming lever does a slight bit of adjustment of the stream but only adjust from front to back not side to side.-the overall aim on an elongated toilet is a bit to the back but a shift in your body to the back does work pretty well.- on the braided hose oddly it only has a hand assist nut on one side. It seems better to install this on the bidet side instead of the Tee fitting because if you really want to take it out and clean it why not have that unscrew point on the bidet side so it can easily be done by hand.I can't speak to the longevity but it seems pretty well built. Those worrying about the flimsiness of the plastic handle don't realize that plastic is pretty flexible and tough and that there is a soft hose which goes to the valve inside the structure and that is not going to break even if you happen to crack the plastic.",
