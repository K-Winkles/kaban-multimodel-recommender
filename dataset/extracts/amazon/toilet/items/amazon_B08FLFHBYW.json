                "reviewText": "After I moved into my new house, I looked for quick upgrades that I could do. The toilets seemed easy enough. Some of the criteria that I was looking for in a new toilet were chair height (I am 6'2\") and easy to clean. This toilet checked off both of those boxes and was one of the more affordable ones that I found.It should be standard that all toilets that are primarily used by adults should be chair height. The full wrap around easy clean toilets are becoming more common. These toilets have the securing bolts hidden has a skirt that wraps around it. Some toilets require you to wrap your arm around from the back to secure the bolts. It does make the skirt easier to clean, but also the bolts extremely more difficult to secure. This toilet is much easier to install because it has access ports on each side of it that allows you to secure the bolts through.I was able to install the toilet by myself and that included cleaning out the old seal, installing a new seal, mounting and securing the toilet. It took me less than 25 minutes to do. It looks great.Some things to keep in mind is that the internal pieces of the toilet are integrated into the toilet, so it is nat as easy as fixing a traditional toilet. You just can't swap out a single component. Also, I ran into a major issue when I was installing the toilet. I have the toilet water supply valves that come out of the floor. I had to reposition the valve in order for the toilet to fit. It was a tight squeeze but I made it work.This is a decent toilet well worth your consideration as an upgrade. It is the evolution of the bathroom toilet and is the future. I recommend this toilet. It is simple enough to install, very comfortable, and cleaning it is a cinch.",

This toilet seems to be able to handle everything so far and it looks nice and is very easy to clean. I think the only disclaimer I have is that for somebody who has a little bit of arthritis, pushing down on the flusher is harder than a standard flusher? It\u2019s not hard, but it\u2019s not as easy as just holding down a handle because you do have to hold down the button to make it flush.",

                "reviewText": "So, I gave it only 1 star because of installation and function. I said terrible if you do not have \"COMPLETE\" ample room on both sides of the toilet, then this toilet is \"NOT\" for you. in the install video it is very easy because there is \"NOTHING\" around it. Sure, but that is not the case in 95% of homes. I have removed and installed many toilets but this one was the \"ONLY\" difficult one. the difficulty is in placing it where it belongs. most especially that it completely has the shut off valve behind the toilet. with no room even behind the toilet to turn on the valve after placing it, I had to get a 20\" hose and turn the water valve on \"BEFORE\" placing the toilet. once that is done, the rest is fine and the toilet looks great. Then, you come to use it. If you use the #1 button it doesnt flush that all the way. So you can imagine how it is for #2. People like me write reviews for a reason and that is for others not to fall for the fancy ads. this is a final review edit after few months of using it. I am getting rid of it.",
