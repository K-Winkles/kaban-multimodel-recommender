                "reviewText": "I can't fully express how well this toilet works. I was a little aprehensive about living full time with a composting toilet. I had done a fair bit of research on the topic in preparation for living in a tiny house and this one seemed to be the clear leader.I had so many concerns: would it have an unpleasant odor? Would it be difficult to use? Would it require constant cleaning? What about installation? Most importantly, HOW WILL I LEARN TO AIM??Well I am pleased to report after two weeks of full time use that all my concerns are calmed.Firstly, it has no discernable odor, even when the lid is lifted or the upper portion is lifted partially when removing the liquids bottle to empty it every other day or so. Even when in use it us less odiferous than a standard flush toilet because the little onboard fan is constantly whisking any odors right out the vent hose.It is not difficult to use, just sit and go. Open the trap door before a solids deposit of course, but otherwise just do what you do naturally.Installation was easy, this 50 ish woman with slightly above average handy person skills did it in 15 minutes.Cleaning is simple if you spray down the inside of the bowl with a water and white vinegar mix after EVERY use and perform a minor wipe up with a paper towel (which you then just drop into the trap door) if you have a particularly egregious contact mark. Which leads me to AIMING, which is not even a thing, just sit down comfortably. This thing is so well designed that unless you have some wildly divergent anatomy that I can't even imagine, it is a non issue. That trap door is right where it needs to be. Just remember to open it first. And if you are a dude, just sit already, it's ok, nobody is judging you.As for emptying things, the liquids bottle is easy to remove, cap, carry and dump. I have't got to the point of emptying the solids chamber yet ( I used coir fiber available here on amazon as the composting medium) so I will update if it is anything other than as straightforward and simple as all the other aspects of this product. If you want lots of details on that there are several good youtube videos on the topic.The brilliant design, heavu duty construction, super simple installation and stellar online support makes this worth every single penny.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars With considered attention and minimal effort this is a clean and efficient no water toilet system.",
                "reviewText": "I bought this Toilet system for my vintage Airstream that is parked as a farm dwelling in rural Montana. While it does take a few minutes of reading to understand the system, if you use it with care and pay attention to your output, it works very well. I found it easy to install. I was able to adapt a vent opening to connect the vent hose to the existing toilet exhaust in the Airstream. I trimmed the vent hose to fit nicely. I've got mine in a narrow space so it's not mounted to the floor--I have to pull it forward to release the side clips to empty the urine container and to slide off the solid waste collector. I've just placed a sturdy washable outdoor rubber mat under it and it doesn't slide or tip as the space is snug. Emptying the Urine Container is simple but you do have to empty often--every 2-3 days for 1 person using only this toilet. The solid waste is a bit trickier, but if you follow the directions and upend the solid bin collector into a bag as directed, it's straight forward. Although I could wait longer, I dump the bin every 4 weeks. I'm able to manage it with a bit of effort in the small bathroom space. I use coconut fiber as the composting material--I bought enough to fill a large covered bin which I store outside in all weather--just add the block to your fiber storage bin and add water as directed--when moistened break into pieces--it looks like nice clean brown fibrous material--just allow plenty of room for the coco fiber brick to expand. You can then scoop the coconut fiber into the toilet solid waste receptacle to the right level. When you're ready to empty the solid waste, do stretch the opening of a 13 gallon kitchen bag over the opening of the base tightly over the rim so that you can invert the base and empty the contents into the bag--I use a 13 gallon composting bag. Don't count on the waste to be fully composted when it comes out of the bin although it isn't smelly if you use the toilet as directed. You'll want to dispose of the waste in a responsible manner--further composting or approved disposal method. I dump mine into a fully contained disposal compost system used only for this waste--it will take a long time to fill my system since it contains only the solids from one toilet/one person. I intend to compost it for 2 full years before using it--and then around trees we've planted. So far, I've used the toilet for Fall and Winter use in a mostly heated space but I'll update the review after a full year. I've tried multiple systems for toilet waste--and am very happy with the comfort of the toilet, functionality, cleanliness and appearance. If the costs were less, I'd buy several for our farm--as it is, they're a bit of an investment although I'm very happy to have mine.Edit update. As of May 2022 I\u2019m still completely happy with the toilet and it is still functioning as intended.",
