Like MANY others have written elsewhere, we have found that BOTH ours clog easily and necessitate serious plunging in order to clear the blockage. They look good but the water cistern (tank) lids are ill fitting and the push buttons assembly on the top tarnishes and starts to peel within a year. Finally, the seats are really cheap and nasty and the slow-close mechanism on one of ours broke within a year. I would suggest you avoid at all costs.",

Not a scratch or Nick anywhere. Toilet was perfect. The bad: none. However, the ugly: I have nothing nice to say about the installation. I had many choice words not suitable for a PG audience. Lining up the floor bolts sucks. You have to kind of guess. Hooking up the water supply is equally miserable. Tightening floor bolts is equally miserable. I recommend a deep socket instead of wrench. Having said all that, it\u2019s a great looking, well built toilet. Have fun.",

                "reviewText": "We got this for our powder bathroom and got to say it really helps bring a certain level of coolness to the room. It definitely as hard to install as they say. I would recommend getting one of those nicer, perfect seal rubber toilet rings because it can adjust, has two blue tabs that are easier to line up where you\u2019ll place it and tighten the bolts to. Our base plate was raised so we didn\u2019t need the blue extender part for that. I would also recommend having 3 people help install. Yup, 3 people. Two people to gently lower it. And 1 person checking each side to make sure the toilet is lining up where the bolts are and helping finely directing the placement of the toilet over those bolts. If you miss the placement with a standard wax ring, you\u2019ll have to try again. It also is a tad longer in back so I\u2019d also recommend a flexible hose that connects to the toilet instead of rigid pipe to allow you to get it connected. We were able to tighten the bolts with a 11mm wrench (or 10mm, around there ish).The seat itself isn\u2019t really comfortable, but this is a fun powder room and not a main one, so it doesn\u2019t get used super often.",
