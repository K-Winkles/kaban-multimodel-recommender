                "reviewText": "This toilet is a must have edition for either your new bathroom or your existing bathroom. It's super easy to install and being it comes in one piece. It's not a bunch of take apart in assembly needed. It's very sturdy once assembled and secured in. And the best part is, it doesn't weigh a ton compared to a normal toilet. So that way, you're able to easily pick it up. My favorite part is a toilet seat because it easily disconnects so that way you're easily able to clean underneath it without having to take all the time to unscrew it or take it apart.",

                "reviewText": "I love the one-piece construction, the straight sides, and the easily removable (by pushing a button) seat. It makes it so easy to clean! Another nice feature is the smooth surface under the rim, where most toilets have a very rough and unfinished surface. This toilet is slick there and cleans up very easy. Another nice touch is the button for the flush which uses less water eing smaller than the button for the big flush, which makes the choice intuitive, which is good for guests and people with a memory like mine. Other toilets that have the double flush sizes have no way to differentiate which button is which. One word of caution when purchasing is to be sure there is enough distance next to the toilet to the supply valve. The straight sides make this toilet wider than most. Mine barely fit, it was up against the valve so much I was lucky to get it installed. I highly recommend this toilet based on it's design!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. We keep replacing our toilet after a certain period of time and so got this. This product has overall good build quality & looks fancy in our bathroom. It is reasonably priced in competition & so would recommend these at this price point.My 2 cents below:Pros:- Good build quality of this seat- Both the flaps have a mechanism that closes down slowly and so does not slam them hard- Dual flush with 1.1/1.6 GPF water capacity- Comfortable to sit on as it has a 17\" height- Quick release seat would make cleaning it convenient on a regular basis- Easy to install however I did get it done through a plumber- Sturdy and feels solid- Fixes very neatly and doesn't wobble while using- Comes well packed in a nice box as single piece unitCons:- None as this price factor & the features it offers",

                "reviewText": "Beautiful modern and power flushing toilet that is easy to clean. However, being a one piece toilet it was heavy to carry upstairs and even more difficult to install in a tight space like mine. Make sure you get a wax ring that can be reset with bolt guides or you'll have a heck of a time not breaking the wax seal trying to seat the toilet over the wax seal. Or just hire a plumber and avoid the hassle. I was able to install it after multiple attempts to set the toilet. Its hard because you cannot see the bolts because they are hidden inside the toilet and you can't have someone look for you because my space was too tight. It was hard to install but I did it and I'm very pleased with this quality modern toilet that will be so easy to keep clean.",

Moving a water supply line is not easy and can be very expensive. Also take into account the weight of a one-piece toilet if having to move up or down flights of stairs. I would consider the TOTO DRAKE TWO-PIECE elongated, dual-tornado flush instead. The Toto has a modern design with room for the standard water supply line coming from a wall. Most professionals recommend TOTO.",
