                "reviewText": "This is the second bidet I've tried through Amazon Vine. The first was a hand-held sprayer, and this one, from Livilord, is the kind you attach to your toilet, under the toilet seat, and connect to your water supply with a t-splitter.I like both styles of bidet - the hand-held kind gives you total flexibility and can also be used for diaper rinsing, bathroom cleaning, etc. This one allows you to just enjoy the cleanliness of a bidet with less work and maneuvering.Installation was not difficult. You remove your toilet seat, get the bidet unit and base connector in place, then reinstall the toilet seat, inserting the seat screws through the holes in the base connector and retightening. Then you remove the supply line from your toilet's inlet valve, screw on the T-connector included by Livilord, and reattach the supply line to the water supply and connect the included supply line to the bidet unit. You will need a screwdriver (for your toilet seat screws) and preferably an adjustable wrench for removing and reinstalling the supply lines.The controller is located on the right side of your toilet, so this is ideal for right-handed folks. There is an on/off switch, two switches that change the angle of the water sprayer from \"feminine wash\" (front spray) to bum-wash, and a dial that takes you from low pressure to high pressure. The highest pressure setting is perfectly comfortable.This fit fine on our ProFlow round-seat, pressure-assist toilet, and the directionality of the spray works as intended - you may need to give yourself a tiny wiggle to make sure the water makes contact where you prefer it, but it goes where intended.In summary, this is a very nice, low-cost, non-electric bidet option. If you've been toying with the idea of a bidet, I encourage you to take the plunge (LOL). Yes, it's cold water, but many will tell you, you quickly get used to it. The cleanliness and reduced toilet paper usage is well worth it!!!Thanks, Livilord, and Amazon Vine.",

                "reviewText": "I was really surprised how well this worked. Its a great value. It has 3 buttons. One button turns it off but if you hold it down then it will self-clean the nozzle before turning off. The other button is for a female while the last one is for a male or female. It also has a spray intensity knob. It doesn't have any way to adjust the angle, but we all found it not really necessary. To install it, you unscreen the water feed hose at the toilet and insert the T-connector. There is a compression washer you add on the part that screws into the toilet. However, it was leaking like crazy. I'm quite sure the T-connector was defective. I just went to the big box store and bought a high quality brass T-connector which connects at the other end of the supply hose. e.g. between the incoming water pipe and the supply hose instead of between the supply hose and toilet. I also replaced my existing stainless steel supply hose. Then no leaks and it worked perfectly. Because of the defective T connector and no aiming adjustment, I took off 1 star. But otherwise this is 5-stars. I use it everyday and it works perfectly, so does my kids. So the adjustment tis not really necessary if you slighly adjust your position.",

                "reviewText": "This bidet package comes with everything you need to install it except a wrench and screwdriver. It was easy to install but I took longer than was probably necessary because I wanted to make sure I didn't strip any hose threads during the process. The instruction manual could have been a bit clearer, but honestly, there were not a lot of parts, so it wasn't hard to figure out what to do. The T-valve and hoses were of good quality, so once I ensured that the connections were snug, there was no leakage from anywhere. And I also made sure that the rubber washer was properly seated in the hose. Besides from the T-valve and hoses, the rest of the device is plastic. I'm okay with that because plastic is easy to keep clean.The design is simple yet effective. I like that this device doesn't require any electricity or cost a fortune. And it fits under my toilet seat without any design hiccups. The toilet seat and lid fit just the way they did before. The quick release feature is super easy and will make cleaning under the toilet lid as easy as it was before. The self-cleaning feature and retractable nozzles are also quite handy. In addition, the current price is ridiculously low for something that will have so many benefits.Because everyone's anatomy is a bit different, to ensure that the spray is hitting the areas that you want to clean, you need to maneuver your body around few inches. And then you can increase the forcefulness of the spray until you feel clean.I have just started using it but I can already see that toilet paper usage is going to be significantly lower around here. Also, although the water spray is cold, cleaning with water actually feels better than trying to get clean by using wads of toilet paper.",
