After tightening with a wrench, check again for leaks.If you encounter any problems during the installation process, you can you can ask us for help at any time at any time.

                "reviewText": "This item comes complete with everything you need including sealing tape. Installation is easy and quick and the long hose length gives you lots of options for placement. We had one of the tap heads stop working, it's a sealed unit so beware it can't be fixed. You can however buy replacement head units which is an easy fix. Works well and both the wall mount and cistern bracket are easy to use and install.",
