He loved the night light! The seat beeps when you sit on it, but was easy to turn it off by holding down button on the control on the seat. (little beep didn't bother me, but he said it was anoying\ud83e\udd74) And what about that? I like that if the remote gets misplaced by a child (or husband? \ud83e\udd23) you can still use the basic functions from the small panel ON the seat. It has all the features like our more expensive bidet, but we only paid about $220 for this one. We rarely use the dryer but cool (warm\ud83d\ude01) to have. Warm seat, warm water, options for nozzle position, dryer/water heat, even has a button for a child option. (which we didn't try.) If the worst thing I can say is I wish it came with batteries for the remote, I think it's a great product and for the money, you really should give it a try! I would never go back to doing without one!*2 Additional notes: for those contemplating purchasing one with NO plug in for just cold water use, (if you have no access to an outlet near your commode) it's STILL better than not having a bidet! We have a very cheap, cold water/no remote bidet in the trailer and in the colder months when the water is VERY COLD\ud83e\udd76, AFTER the first cold water hits, it's not bad\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, but if you are getting a bidet and have access to an outlet, I would get the warm water one. Realize we sometimes camp in below freezing temps at night, so the cold water in your house shouldn't get THAT cold. \ud83e\udd14Also, remote vs no hand held remote:(attached to seat) is tricky. If you can store it on the wall and anyone using it keeps it in the holder when not using it, I would recommend the hand held since it is MUCH easier to use it if you have lots of options. But if you are worried the remote will be misplaced, you may want to consider the ones built into the seat. Our TRAILER bidet has only TWO options, pressure of the water and position. So it is easy to USE/CHANGE those 2 while sitting and not being able to SEE what you are selecting. \ud83e\uddd0 I would advise REMOTES if possible if you have many options since most people can't change them all while sitting.I hope this long review will help!",

No leaks or problems. My son mounted the remote on the wall by the toilet paper, and the UV light keeps the toilet cleaner longer. It has definitely helped my back as I don't have to do any twisting. Would definitely buy again.",
