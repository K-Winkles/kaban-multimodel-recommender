Although it perfectly fits my tiny 1920s bathroom, it does not feel like a child\u2019s commode. Not chair height, but I was not looking for that. Taller humans are not complaining. No complaints after 3 weeks of use.",

                "reviewText": "I love the toilet. It solved a space problem but ...Two problems.The first is that a typical water supply valve exiting the wall will not fit between the toilet and the wall. I had very little space to try and move the toilet sideways enough and ended up with the valve only being accessible with some difficulty through the hatches in the sides of the toilet. The answer is to plan very carefully where you're installing the toilet and be prepared to relocate the valve if necessary before you're about to install the new one.The second one is the toilet seat. It fits well and does slowly and quietly lower itself. But it is really thin and flexible plastic. It bends too easily. It feels very flimsy. I would be very interested to learn of a strong wooden alternative seat that anyone has used to replace the OEM one.",

                "reviewText": "Good unit. Looks great.Gave us 4\" additional space between us and the tub face. Happy campers.I read various reviews of several small space toilets and chose to go with this one.We found our town offered a $100 credit for any toilet which did not exceed 1.28 gal per flush. Although the dual flush exceeds that, this single mode unit does not. We already received $100 off our utility bill this month. Yay.Anyway the install was straightforward. I did not have any issues with supply, (adapter now included), access to the closet bolts (from the rear) or alignment. I did mark the location of the bolt alignment on the floor with blue tape and marker due to the fact that you cannot readily see their location on this style of base.A word about umm efficiency. Some reviews of other small space, water saver,units dissed their purchases on their part Deux capabilities. This unit has a great topbowl swirl system and adequate suction. No problemo here. ok, nuff said Totally satisfactory in every regard. .",

The toilet is not the easiest to install with close walls on either side but I honestly should have thought that through when I purchased the item. Only gave it 3 stars so others know of that one constraint. Customer service was responsive and great to work with when I accidentally broke a piece of the toilet while unpacking. Great product for anyone that needs to take a number 2.",

They appear to save space with the tank area. Single flush works well without any problems with a clog. Because it is a one piece tank and the weight, it basically takes 2 people to move and install the tank. I found it easier to shim the unit with a 2 x 4 piece of lumber and lower the toilet onto the flange. Would I buy this again? YES. Just have someone their to help.",
