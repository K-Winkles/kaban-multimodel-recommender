                "reviewText": "Overall this is a pretty good toilet seat. It wouldn't take much to make this a 5-star product. But the few issues I had with it were enough I couldn't give it better than 3 stars as it is.The first and IMO biggest problem is that they specifically advertise that it comes with \"comprehensive\" instructions; it came with no instructions. I didn't find it difficult to reason out how to install it, and I was able to confirm what to do using the instructions on the product page (though those were not what I'd call comprehensive). I'm sure anyone who has done this type of job themselves in the past can go straight to work on it. But if you advertise as \"DIY friendly\" and boast about your included instructions... then include the instructions.Also note, they say it fits most modern toilets and if you run through the pictures they show dimensions (identifying it as \"O shaped\"). It seems to be a little short for the standard round dimensions; it covers the bowl of the toilet I put it on and is perfectly functional, but you can tell looking at it that it could maybe stand to be 1/2\" longer. (It did occur to me to wonder if my toilet was sized for an \"elongated\" seat; that is not the case, as that would be much too long.)The last issue is that twice during installation one of the plastic \"feet\" on the underside of the seat fell out. I was able to fit it back in and it seems the pressure-fit is enough to keep it in place; it probably just got rattled loose from all the moving around and driving screws and whatnot; I hope it will not continue being an issue now that installation is complete. (If it is, I'll update accordingly... and probably attempt a repair with glue.)All of that said... the mounting hardware seems reasonably sturdy (better than some I've seen). It's not necessarily the easiest type of mounting hardware to work with. (It uses a simple nut and bolt rather than a wing nut; getting the fasteners to engage can range from easy-on-the-first-try to frustrating-and-time-consuming; I had one go each way.)The seat itself has a sort of \"quick release\" mechanism from the hinges, which could be convenient for cleaning or if you need to replace just the seat (i.e. for some reason the hinges outlive the seat itself; though this assumes you can get another one like it). The seat and lid resist being \"slammed\" down.",

I have installed many toilets in my time with no issues but this one has no flange wholes to mount the unit to the floor so I am not sure how to install it. It also came with a battery pack, clear bottle and two values but again with no instructions I am not sure what to do with any of them.Very disappointed!!",
