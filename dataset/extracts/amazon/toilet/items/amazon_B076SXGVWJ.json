                "reviewText": "I'm in construction, bought these for a job i'm doing, the owner likes skirted toilets as they have the flat sides, giving them less surfaces for dirt, dust and \"other\" to accumulate. And making it quite easy to clean.Anyone that has installed skirted toilets know they tend to be a pain, with you laying down and trying to squeeze your hand in a small hole in the back of the toilet to use a small tool or wrench to tighten down the flange nuts. The space is so tight even with a ratcheting wrench it can take quite some time.These toilets have a unique setup, they actually have 2 plastic arm like pieces that attach to the flange, then you set the toilet and run a screw in the side of the toilet into those arms, then pop on the caps that cover the screws. IT was certainly a lot better than the normal skirted toilets.The square design is unique and i like that. Seems roomy, almost like the double wide recliners vs a regular.My only concern is that in 5 years when they want to replace the seat, is the company still going to make the seat for it, will they be able to find a seat since it is unique. I do not think a regular seat would fit this.While this is the first time i used this specific toilet, i have used 4 other skirted toilets made by the same company, and while i all have been purchased roughly in the last 2 years, i have had no issues reported.",

                "reviewText": "The only problem - since this was a replacement for our old toilet - was the water feed. It was too close and was inside the toilet's exterior. I need to redo the water shut off valve so that I can shut the water off if it is necessary. But this is not a fault of the toilet. The first thing noticed was how modern it looks with a very easy to clean exterior. The choice of flush is saving us a lot of water. The flush and the water refill are extremely quiet. For those remodeling their bathroom, especially in a water poor area, this toilet is the correct choice. It has impressed everyone that has seen it (or tried it).",

Make sure that you show your contractor the toilet before they do the tiling or piping because the toilet goes completely flush against the wall. It looks amazing and is very elongated. I was scared that I was not going to be able to find parts in the future if it breaks however, the company that makes it is in California. Over all I am super happy with this toilet!!!",

It is aesthetically pleasing, an excellent fit for my rectangular powder room, a great complement to other pieces in the bathroom, and most of all, operates quietly even when using the double flush function of the dual flush option. My only criticism is that it took three plumbers to install it. The first plumber told me straight up he could not install it. The second plumber started to install it and then told me he needed the expertise of another plumber. Together both of them installed it. The installation cost nearly twice as much as the toilet.",

Took two plumbers to install due to moving supply line and very heavy. Cannot access supply line or turn off valve if within confines of toilet back. Looks great in pictures but not so much in small bathroom. Easy to clean. Nice Euro look. Not accessible height.",

I also want to give my best compliments to their customer service. I reported to them that one of the soft closing seat came with a small crack, but I did not report the damage to Amazon because it was just a tiny one. After a couple of months the crack expanded and I contact them to find out where I could buy a new seat. They prompt respond me and for my surprise the sent a brand new seat at no cost. Thank you so much!!",
