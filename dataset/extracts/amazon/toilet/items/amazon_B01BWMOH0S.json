                "reviewText": "Next to my iPad, this is one of my greatest purchases. No post purchase regrets, with either of these products. The engineering that went into the design is apparent. The tall tank offers great potential energy in the water delivered to the flush ring. The flush ring water enters the bowl through the siphon jet, forcing the trapway (siphon) water over the hump to develop a powerful siphonic action. The siphonic action is amplified because of the 2\u201d trapway. Next to a commercial toilet, this is the most powerful flushing toilet I\u2019ve seen.I installed the toilet with the superior parts that came with it. Installation was simple and straight-forward. I appreciated the stainless steel tank bolts, Fluidmaster Fill Valve and Fluidmaster Flush Valve. These are time-tested and inexpensive replacement parts that work well. I used a simple wax seal to mount the toilet on a flange that was level with the tile floor.",

The toilet needs a seal and gasket to connect with the flange. This does not come with the wax ring seal, the gasket to connect it, or a seat. Even know it\u2019s clearly pictured with a seat. Still, worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "I'm in the middle of fixing up my house. I bought this toilet last year, it came in a big box, and since I needed to tear out the rotten bathroom floor before installing the toilet, I set it to the side and didn't open the box until today. To my surprise, the big box was nearly empty, containing only a tiny box with the toilet tank inside, but no toilet bowl. I'm very angry. It was a lot of money to pay to receive only half a toilet, and I can't even buy the bowl anywhere, because they don't appear to sell it. I see that several other reviewers also got only one half, either the toilet tank or the bowl. If you buy, don't tell yourself they wont do the same to you, because they will.",

                "reviewText": "I manage a small apartment building. This toilet is great because of:1. 1.1 GPF2. Standard, simple flush mechanisms -- replacement parts can be found everywhere.3. Low cost.4. Good brand -- Am Std.My go-to toilet has been the American Standard Cadet 3 -- the 3 represents the 3 inch trapway between the tank and bowl.The Cadet 3 1.6 gpf was amazing and never ever clogged.The Cadet 3 1.28 gpf wasn't bad, but in reality is was really the 1.6 with less water in the tank. The problem was that a lot of water velocity was lost.This 1.1 gpf works great. It had to use a few a few tricks/tweaks vs the Cadet 3:1. The trapway is back to 2\".2. The tank is narrower, forcing water in the tank to start at a higher level (potential energy state).3. The tank's flapper closes quickly, but you can hold it down for flushing \"bigger loads\".4. The bowl's waterway is a little more constricted so that it requires less water.5. You can see the other design features on the American Standard website.Overall these tweaks create great water pressure/flow/suction. It's really quite impressive.If you need a more water, just hold down the flush handle a few extra seconds -- no big deal.Tips for you installers:1. Don't use the included Fluidmaster fill valve. Buy a Korky Platinum. It's much better.2. Buy your own seat.3. Buy the Fluidmaster Better Than Wax seal.4. Don't forget to use shims to make sure the toilet is secure.I say this toilet is underrated because it is a special-order item at Home Depot. If people saw it in the store, I think it would ruin the sales of the other more expensive toilets.I am wary of fancy dual-flush toilet mechanisms. One single plumber phone call can ruin all the money saved by using less water. KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid is my motto.",
