                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Comparable to the Luxe W85 But for Much Less!",
                "reviewText": "This is a bidet for my second bathroom, my first being the Luxe W85 (Walmart exclusive model) that I bought a while ago on sale and they are very comparable in actual use and features but this Yasfel is cheaper by quite a bit.This top section is aimed at those that never had a bidet, the bottom is for those wondering about the installation/comparison between this Yasfel and the Luxe W85.---------------------------------First, if you never had a bidet, you should get one! They aren't as life changing as some make it out to be, but they are nice to have, aren't very expensive, can be installed easily, and are pretty discrete once installed.Second, I don't think a bidet will eliminate the need for TP, but will cut down on how much is needed depending on your habits. Also, I think you will need to use at least some to dry off after using it.Third, if you are worried about it not being heated, worry not! Unless you live in climate where it's cold enough to need a heated toilet seat, I think you can get away with an unheated bidet. I, at least, wasn't as sensitive to cold water down there as I thought I would be. It's not nearly as bad as washing your hands in cold water is, for instance, since we have far more nerves in our hands.And forth, installation is easy! Don't let that scare you off. Included instructions are nice and clear with diagrams to help. The kit even includes some Teflon plumbers tape so all you will need is a screwdriver (to remove the toilet seat) and a wrench to work with the hoses.---------------------------------Installation was just as easy as the W85 (took me about 30 minutes), but it should be noted that unlike the Luxe, the Yasfel doesn't come with wrenches and only a metal T waterline splitter. So you will need your own tools to install the Yasfel. However, I think most people that are buying a bidet intending to install it themselves probably have the requisite tools of a wrench and screwdriver. Personally, I think this is a win for the Yasfel; I would rather pay less and have fewer accessories that I'm not going use and/or not need, but that's just me.One thing to note on installation, my toilets used PEX from the water valve to the water tank that was exactly the length necessary to reach. PEX is too stiff to bend it enough to make room for the T splitter so I had to replace my supply line hoses with the normal braided metal ones in order to install both of my bidets. YMMV since every bathroom is different, but it's something to be aware of if you are considering one of these.Once installed, function of the Yasfel and W85 are exactly the same. One dial controls which nozzle is used and one controls the water pressure. The Yasfel has the advantage of having a more gradual pressure control, which I appreciate.The only feature that the W85 has that the Yasefel doesn't is the splash guard door. So if that's a deal breaker, be aware. Also, the water inlet placement of the two are different. The Yasfel's inlet is pointing directly down while the W85's inlet is at the back of the control section. This means that the water hose on the Yasfel hangs down and is more likely to be bumped, caught, or generally be in the way compared to the rear exiting W85. Depending on your bathroom layout and toilet placement, this could be an issue for you, but for me, since that side of my toilet is right next to my tub, I don't foresee it being a problem.And lastly, both models share an annoyance. The label/decal around the dials isn't made from a hard, clear plastic, it's a rubbery material. This means cleaning that portion is needlessly difficult since it clings to contaminates. This is a shame since the rest of the bidet is hard, slick plastic that cleans up super easy.All in all, I'm very happy with this Yasfel. It's feature rich, easy to use and install, and was a great price at only about twenty freedom buckaroos. So get one! Your bottom will thank you. :)",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Works well enough but instructions deficient",
                "reviewText": "I gave this bidet toilet attachment a rating of 4 because it works well enough although there's considerable room for improvement in the control of the water jets, and because the instructions had significant deficiencies. Most importantly, for people who do not have experience in the installation of toilets or toilet valves, the instructions merely state that the water tank of the toilet should be emptied by flushing the toilet before disconnecting the water supply hose. Flushing the toilet does not get all the water out of the toilet tank. Without exaggeration, there was about a gallon of water in the bottom of the toilet tank after I flushed the toilet a couple of times to get as much water as I could out of the toilet tank by flushing. I then used a sponge and a bucket to remove about a gallon of water that was still in the bottom of the tank. Many people without experience would have the very unpleasant surprise of a large amount of water spilling out onto the floor of their bathroom when they disconnected the hose in order to install the T- valve. The instructions also didn't mention that the cone shaped rubber washer needed to be put inside the metal nut of the supplied hose before connecting that hose thatgoes from the bottom of the toilet tank and T-valve to the bidet controls. Without that cone shaped rubber seal between the metal hose end and the connecting nut, the connection will leak.The toilet seat pads that come with the kit are about 30 to 40% thicker than they should be. In my installation I could not use them at all. I suppose I could take a hacksaw and cut them down to a thickness that would be appropriate. Also, they would not stick securely to the underside of the toilet seat and there were only three of them, whereas four would make a much better set for distribution of weight on the toilet seat.Finally, the water spray has to be used on the lowest setting. It's ridiculous that the spray can go much more powerful than that. And, the adjustments on both of the control valves need to be set at an extreme end of their spectrum.I haven't decided yet whether I will keep this bidet attachment or return it. My wife and I will try using it for a while and see if we can adjust to it. I would like to have found the one I purchased for another bathroom. This unit is less expensive than many of them on the market. That's part of the reason I gave it a rating of 4 instead of 3.The instructions should have been proof read by a native English speaker.",

It has a lot of pressure, but (no pun intended) I am used to that now. You can somewhat regulate the pressure by not turning the valves fully open. I have been using it for 9 months. the odd time the rear valves will drip. I turn it to the off position and that fixes it (you can leave it at a setting for next time). I would definitely buy this unit again",
