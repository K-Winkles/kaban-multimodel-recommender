                "reviewText": "I recently moved into an older house that had 40 year old orange curtains that were being held together by the accumulated dust on them. As I am not a fan of dust or the color orange, I decided to replace the curtains. I'm on a budget and purchased the CrisDowa Grommet Blackout curtains during Amazon's Black Friday sale. For the price, these curtains are fantastic. They are affordable, thin, and blackout - everything I was looking for. They come in a wide variety of colors and sizes, which is great because all my windows are sized differently so I was forced to purchase an assortment of them. They are machine washable, which to me is another HUGE bonus. My one tiny complaint - even after washing them, the shipping folds in the curtains would not come out. They are ironable, but I do not own an iron.This item arrived in a timely manner and in perfect condition.",

I ordered two packs (so 4 panels) and it left a good amount of extra but two would not have covered all the window. Might have been able get away with three panels but I would rather have extra than not enough. Provides great coverage as no one will need able to see through the fabric. Really like the quality and look. Nice gray color too. I haven\u2019t tried washing it but hopefully will not have to for A long time. Exceeded my expectations.",
