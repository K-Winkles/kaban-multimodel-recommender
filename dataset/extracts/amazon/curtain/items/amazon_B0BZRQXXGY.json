I dampened the panels briefly in the shower and then dried about 15 minutes on delicate cycle to eliminate the creases from packaging and shipment. They were so easy to hang from a simple gold rod, absolutely no wrinkles or creases. I love the subtle sheer weave, perfect covering my colored metal blinds over my computer desk. The right amount of light, barely transparent fabric, hanging perfectly with no hassle, no fuss, no problems. It's a wonderful product at such a budget price, so I'll be ordering more sets of the same longer panels for my larger windows. I am happy I found Mystic Home curtains on Amazon. Mystic Home service is fantastic! Thank you! (:",

They are just the perfect window covering without blocking the sun coming in for the winter months. We use darkening curtains all summer so nice to find something that I can see out when working away in the house. Bought a couple lengths. Happy with them all.",
