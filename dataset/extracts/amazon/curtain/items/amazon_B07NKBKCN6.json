The blue branch are a slate blue color which is exactly what I wanted.I have a curtain rod that is a little bit thicker and is like brushed aluminum (or nickel) and it compliments the curtain and the rings on the curtain perfectly.They are a tad bit pricey so the price part gets 3 stars... but everything else is 5 star for sure!",
