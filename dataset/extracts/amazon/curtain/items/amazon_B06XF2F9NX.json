                "reviewText": "Detailed impression of the beige/gray in 108\u201d long. I am a former home-dec seamstress/installer, so there\u2019s a little experience here. I ordered 1 panel as a sample & it\u2019s a nice product, especially for the price. As with most ready-made window treatments, they do require some TLC to attain a quality appearance. This COLOR is a very light neutral, not too cool/warm. The FABRIC face has a good appearance/feel of a woven linen-like fabric; w/different tones. No little irregular nubbies/threads like true linen; but neither is there the high maintenance/cost. As one reviewer mentioned, there are thin, evenly spaced, horizontal, \u201cshadow\u201d lines (4-5 per inch) only visible only when backlit by the sun (but so do my existing silk curtains) They are not visible when inspecting the face or back fabric. They\u2019re consistent, and not necessarily a deal breaker. The BACK of this panel is white, medium weight, slick/smooth, dense polyester that is fused somehow perfectly to woven face fabric. Sturdy fabric WEIGHT, hangs generally well, w/o hem weights (see training drapes later) Smaller bottom hem is adequate since the fabric is sturdy weight (I often hide a doubled up a pipe cleaner in the outer end of the hems to keep them curved toward the wall). SIZE: Mine measured true to description. (It is not uncommon to get crazy discrepancies in length, cut or evenness. I order extra and return flawed product.) Your rod should project from the wall 3\u201d inches to fully accommodate the back folds. WIDTH CALCULATION Each panel, when \u201cclosed,\u201d hangs w/soft folds/waves to cover 24\u201d of window/wall/rod. Calculate more for a lush look. The panel pulls closed, surprisingly flat enough on the rod, to fan out to cover nearly it\u2019s full width (but it\u2019s not a very pleasing look.) Each panel \u201cSTACKS back\u201d (when fully opened) attractively to about 12\u201d without a smashed up look, can be smushed tighter. I usually order and hang my rods/curtains a size higher, and 12-20\u201d wider than the window so the curtains can open to reveal most of the window. (I recommend 2 panels for a 30-36\u201d window/48-54\u201d rod.) There\u2019s 1&1/2\u201d of grommet/fabric above the rod (if you\u2019re looking for a ceiling to floor look.) I have not addressed the wrinkle conundrum; but they will need pressed/steamed for sharper edges & wrinkles. As with most panels, they want to fan out at the bottom; so to \u201ctrain\u201d your curtains to sway/fold/hang well: hang them; mist them lightly w/water back&front, open them on the window; arrange folds exactly as you want them. Band/\u201cbelt\u201d them w/2\u201d wide, white paper strips, using pins to hold them in place; position paper bands at the hem, top and middle. Not too tight/no pinched fabric. Let sit for a couple of days. The hems are pretty stubborn ;-)",
