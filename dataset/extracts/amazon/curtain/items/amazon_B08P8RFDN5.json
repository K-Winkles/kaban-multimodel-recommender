                "reviewText": "As soon as I received them I ironed them from being folded in its package and hung them up.They are so so beautiful, soft and made of quality material.The images says 80% sun blockout, but in the description it states 75%?? I had my drapes closed for quite awhile and the drapes kept my kitchen cool with just the right amount of sun coming through (perfect). Also blockout 100% UV rays too.I love this brand, they have beautiful colors, patterns, quality of material and the right amount of sun coming through show casing the beauty of these curtains along with my bronze green sun blockout curtains. I am very happy and will be purchasing more in the future.Thank you Amazon my purchase came over nite.",

                "reviewText": "It was pretty hard to find curtains that were not solid. They do keep out the bright sunlight of the afternoon sun, and while not completely blackout, they are enough for a living room. I would not be happy with these in my bedroom for darkness. Simply took them out and hung them up, and they looked fine. The patterns match on each pair, but not to other pairs, and since I used 5 pairs in the living room, I had to be careful how I put them up. Still they are not so far off that most people will notice. Wrinkles fell out. The material is silky and nice. I think they are working out nicely and look good with the neutral greige paint.",
