For me, it's perfect for dimming the noon light enough for the toddler to nap, but so I'm not tripping over toys on my way out of the room. At night, they block all the light pollution from all the flood lights and street lights right outside my kids' windows (if you don't have a night light or hall light on with the door open, you WILL trip over the toys at night). They also are thick enough to do a decent job of keeping the room cool during the day if kept closed.The color is nice (gray), and the material looks elegant with a nice drape, not cheap. There's 2 in a pack which fits the bedroom window great without too much excess or stretching. The metal rings are sturdy and I haven't noticed any corrosion or rusting in our very humid climate.",

The rings on top are a good size to fit any size pole. And they keep the chill out enough. For the small price I paid, I'm 100% satisfied.",

The grommet design makes them easy to install and adjust. Despite being completely synthetic, they have a fabric-like touch. They're a practical choice if you're looking for basic blackout curtains.",
