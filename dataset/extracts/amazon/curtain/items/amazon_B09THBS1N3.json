They fall so nicely and they are more durable than other brands I've owned in the past. I also love the beautiful stitching to keep them from unraveling. They block the dog door so my dog and cat are constantly brushing past them and so far they've taken no damage. Love them!",

                "reviewText": "We just recently had our kitchen and dining room remodeled. I needed new curtains for the dining room and wanted something semi-sheer. These looked perfect. After thinking about it, I decided to get 3 sets. I got these in orange, red and grey, which are the colors of the inside of our house. I wanted to incorporate all the colors on one window so I took all the sets and placed them on a single rod. I put the orange set on first, followed by grey and ended with the red. I have to say, it looks fantastic. When you walk in our house, it's the first thing your eye catches. Everyone states how beautiful it looks and how the colors are so great together.As far as the sheerness, it's just right. We have a fenced backyard (6 foot all the way around) so I'm not concerned about looky loos but still wanted some resemblance of privacy and this provides that. I haven't had any issues with wrinkling or snagging either. The best part though is that even though I didn't spend much for all 3 sets combined, it looks like I spent a small fortune. It makes the dining room look so elegant. I couldn't be happier with my purchase and I would most definitely recommend!",
