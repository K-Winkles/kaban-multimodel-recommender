I needed a neutral colored and light blocking drape that looked nice. These fit that bill. They come in a few different shades and are fully lined. They are not total are plenty of black out for watching TV. Somehow I seem have totally mismeasured the dining room so I had to purchase rings with clips to make them longer. (I could have let down the hem but I wanted a nice looking easier option. I hope I don't have the same issue in living room because it is way too late to return. Overall, I am deliriously happy with the color, print, light block and quality. I haven't washed so I can't comment on that. I will revisit this review, if I can, when it comes time to wash.",
