                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I\u2019ve seen lots of comments comparing these drapes to West Elm or Pottery Barn velvet drapes. I did purchase pottery barn 100% cotton velvet drapes a few years ago so I can easily compare the quality between the two. First of all: the color. Burnt pumpkin is more like pumpkin spice. It\u2019s a wonderfully warm cinnamon orange. I tried to video the drape and flow of the velvet and how the color shimmers like velvet even though it\u2019s not cotton. The black-out lining is not cotton and has an ever so slight rustle to it but the black out feature is super important, especially with the summers we are having. I can set aside the sound of the lining rustling in exchange for it\u2019s hard work keeping heat and light out of the room. The header is versatile in that it can use clip on rings or drapery hooks but I love the back tabs since it gives the velvet a clean gather and isn\u2019t bunched up. I read a lot of reviews about the length and the width not being uniform and I found that to be true. I had to send one panel back since it was s full 2 inches less wide than the other panels. The replacement arrived in 2 days and was only off by a half inch lol. Because these are mass produced drapes and not custom, I can be cool about a half inch difference. The lengths also vary by 1/4 inches. As with the linen sheers I bought to go along with these drapes, I got around that common problem by buying the 96\u201d length so the drapes would puddle and the lengths therefore wouldn\u2019t really matter. The effect is beautiful. All in all, these drapes are perfect and luxurious for very little money. In fact, I wish I had found these before I dropped the hundred and hundreds that I spent on the pottery barn velvet drapes.",

                "reviewText": "I feel like with all of the excellent reviews so far, there's little need for me to add one. But, these drapes warrant yet another positive review.I'm redoing my home study. I'm a very picky person.I sometimes see patients for therapy in my home office, so the space absolutely must be comfortable, cozy, and tasteful. I was searching for fabric that could satisfy two uses:1. I needed window treatments. I have a large window in my study, and I wanted to be able to block sunlight entirely for overnight guests that may be using the pull-out sofa in my study.2. I have two sets of french doors in my study. I wanted heavy fabric that would provide additional sound barrier (for therapy sessions) as well as privacy for over night guests who may be using the pull-out sofa (the french doors are obviously glass).Therefore I needed heft, sound absorption, excellent draping quality, and an overall high-end feel.I checked out several options at retail places - Walmart (lol), Target, Tuesday Morning, BB&B, Macy's. I didn't like anything, and the one time I did find something I liked, the price was ridiculous. I had actually finally decided to go with a textile company that produced theater curtains! The theater curtains would give me the heavy, cozy, soft, professional quality I was looking for at around $15-$20 a yard. I scoured Amazon one last time, and ordered these, expecting to send them back.I love them.They were exactly what I wanted. Excellent draping quality. Beautifully muted, navy blue, with a flat quality to it (absolute ZERO sheen)... Absorbs light and sound wonderfully. I couldn't be more pleased. I feel like these are the exact drapes I had in my head.Just perfect.Side Note: There are some reviews complaining about price, because these are in singles and not pairs. These are not Wal-Mart quality drapes. They are high-end, or perhaps a step down from it. The cost of purchasing each panel singularly would STILL come out cheaper than purchasing these panels for what you'd normally pay as an interior designer.High end drapes are not usually offered in pairs.",
