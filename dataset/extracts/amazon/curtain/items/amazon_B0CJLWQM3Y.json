These sheers are so elegant and look perfect on my window! They are made with good quality material and the little flowers are so pretty and dainty. I was looking for sheers with a scalloped center. I am very pleased with this purchase. I would recommend these curtains to anyone looking to brighten their windows. I love them!",

I bought 2 sets to cover my window wich is 102 inches long by 68 inches tall. My husband and I are very happy with them, they slid right on the pole and did not need any rings for them. My plants will get plenty of sun compared to the solid curtains we had before. When I was outdoors, I could not see through them, so they also offer privacy, from a distance, and are easy to close.",

                "reviewText": "When I get a migraine, the light streaming in one front window is excruciating. It also heats the place up during heat emergencies. I didn't want to get yet another light blocking curtain, as the kitties love to sit in the light that comes through this window but needed something to take the edge off but that would allow us not to have to put a light on inside during daylight hours.These curtains totally do the job, plus they are beautiful and quite good quality. They do an awesome job of diffusing the direct light and throw a nice glow over the front room. They let enough light through to keep light levels pleasant, but reduce the glare. Very happy with them.",
