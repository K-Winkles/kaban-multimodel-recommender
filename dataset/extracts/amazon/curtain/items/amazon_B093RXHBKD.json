They aren't as thick as her last curtains, and dont block as much light, but they still are darker than blinds. The small star cutouts let in little beams of light which she loves!! If you like a dark room though, these might not be for you, my first photo is what morning looks like through the curtains.The size we needed only came with 1 panel, so I had to buy 4... which was pricey. However, these curtains matched her room so perfectly, she couldnt be happier.They are soft, and seem to be well made. The grommets are plastic, not metal.",

                "reviewText": "Last February, I decided to infuse my daughter's bedroom with a little magic by hanging XiDi Girls Princess Dream Star Blackout Curtains. A year later, the enchantment hasn't faded in the slightest. As promised, when the curtains are drawn, a gentle glow seeps through the star cut-outs, creating an utterly charming effect that captivates both of us.Beyond the aesthetics, I'm impressed with their versatility. The set comes with a simple tie, but there's room for creativity \u2013 like adding a star-shaped curtain holder to elegantly sweep the curtains aside for those sunny days. The fabric is thick and durable, suggesting they will withstand the test of time and the inevitable cleaning sessions.Their daily use has been a testament to their quality. Despite the frequent opening and closing, they've endured without a sign of wear over the past year. It's not just the durability that's impressed me but also the touch of whimsy they bring to the room, which truly feels magical now.On top of all this, the curtains are budget-friendly. This was a significant factor for me, as decorating a toddler's room can add up quickly. It's reassuring to find products that offer both quality and affordability, and these curtains are a shining example.",

They are a good thick, heavy material and are of excellent quality. The star cutouts are such a cute touch and almost looks like they have little LED lights in them when the light shines through. I also like that it comes with ties and there are multiple ways to style them for a different aesthetic.",

The cut-out stars are a really great feature and well-done. Highly recommend!",
