                "reviewText": "I bought 3 curtains for my bedroom, the walls being painted blue with glossy white window frames. The white is a blueish color white which make my window frames look cream color. Since the curtains clearly cover the window frame there is no problem with the difference in color. I bought them because they are thermo and black out curtains. I wanted to keep the warm in in the winter and cool in the summer. I have a double window on one wall and single window on the other wall. I think the curtains help my bedroom look larger.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Although it will need to be ironed ( not sure about if you dry them) I air dried them. The other isn\u2019t quite the same as shown. Softer but a tad not as vibrant. Very close though. The quality is excellent. They are thick and definitely keep the light out. I wasn\u2019t looking for blackout just semi. I got magnet curtain tie backs which work very well. These are more than enough for a 33 1/2 ish window. One panel covers more than the window by an inch on both sides which one panel measures 51 inch wide. My window is 53 inches long and these measure exactly 63 inches. It has a smooth texture not like velvet but on that type of texture. They hang perfectly. Doesn\u2019t stick out at the ends which my last curtains did. Drove me crazy. The only downside is the backing is like a table cloth . A little better than the cheap ones. I\u2019m not sure how long it will last. It\u2019s on the thin side. Definitely either get those laundered bags or put on delicate cycle. Took a long time to iron them. Still see the imprints of the foldings. Another thing I noticed is that I tried rubbing the wrinkles with my finger and the material shredded. Try not to wash them too often.",
