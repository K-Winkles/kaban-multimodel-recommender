They still look nice and I liked that there are no wrinkles after taking them out of the packages. These worked well with my colorful bedspread.",

Definitely wash them before you hang them up they stink to high heaven I ordered one similar to this and had the same problem so whoever's making the curtains yucky and the craftsmanship was not horrible I wouldn't even say bad but it needs work, they definitely looked better once I washed and dried them and softens them up and they lay a lot nicer. UPDATE , I didn't notice that one panel is longer then the other, quality is not the best .",
