The charcoal color completely block out light which is what I was looking for. But If you swipe through their images there is one that says blocks some light. The feel and light filtering may depend on the color and pattern you purchase.I live right outside of Chicago and my goal was to block the cold. These do just that. The fabric is not a soft fabric, it's not plastic, it is in between. The point is it works to block the elements. Style wise they are not bad even with the smaller rod.Ignore the puzzles and games in the picture as the room is being redone. But all in all they work as said and again, you get what you pay for.The charcoal color is a very nice color, modern.",

These curtains are an in expensive way to prevent sun and heat coming thru the window, which would also cause higher electric bills, because the AC would run more often. We have multiple pairs of curtains. Highly recommend!",
