During the day they still let the sun through but it casts a lovely hue in the room compared to the blinds. they are light-filtering, not light-blocking. Helps to block the glare from the late-afternoon sun. You can still see out of them when they are closed but still gives you a certain amount of privacy. The sheerness of these curtains filters the light perfectly and blocks enough of the direct view into your living room from the street at night.

                "reviewText": "I searched Amazon for hours to find light-filtering curtains made with a linen material, and non-silver grommets. No easy task! I was happy to find these panels and ordered them in \u201cNatural\u201d right away for 3 windows in my formal living room. For the largest window (pictured), I paired them with \u201cstone-blue\u201d colored panels from another brand\u2014also linen and with bronze grommets! Winning!!! This \u201cNatural\u201d color is just perfect. It\u2019s really hard to choose between beige, white, ivory, cream, natural, etc., when shopping for curtains! But I\u2019m very happy with how these look. They are \u201cwarm\u201d toned and go well with my home decor elements and even my wall paint (Putnam Ivory\u2014Benjamin Moore). They are sheer enough that my beautiful yard won\u2019t be blocked from sight, but they offer a bit of privacy. This window will eventually have 4 of these panels going all the way across the middle, and will be framed by the blue curtains on the swing-out rods at the sides. I\u2019m just waiting on the curtain rod that I ordered! Highly recommend!",
