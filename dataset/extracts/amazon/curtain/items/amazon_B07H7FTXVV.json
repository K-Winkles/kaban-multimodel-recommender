                "reviewText": "I am very VERY happy with these sheer curtains. I previously had yellow sheer curtains, but they were 84\" long and on a cloudy, rainy day, very blah and darkened the room too much. I was shopping around for 36\" long curtains and do you know how very hard it is to find 36\" curtains with some quality? Believe me, it's very VERY hard to find curtains this short in a high quality product. The 36\" size curtains are generally made for kitchen windows and are tissue paper thin and feel and look very cheap. And that had been my experience while shopping too. But then I found these curtains and the reviews were very promising so I gave it a chance and ordered 2 pairs. Amazon delivered them the very next morning! Was I ever pleasantly surprised at how thick these curtains are and they look and feel like high quality, but the price is quite economical. And to get these in a 36\" length is amazing. No more yellow curtains on the floor, these fit perfectly to the window. So happy with these, nice bright white color. I highly recommend these. Worth every penny. The first picture is taken without any inside lighting, the 2nd picture is with inside lighting on. The 3rd and 4th pictures are a close up of the textured design on the curtains, quite attractive! I hope this helps you make the decision to buy these beautiful, high quality sheer curtains, you will thank me later. Thanks Amazon for offering these hard to find, beautiful, 36\" length curtains!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Off color but better quality than expected",
                "reviewText": "The color (which was supposed to be \"warm beige\") looks quite a bit darker than it was shown on the images, almost closer to the \"sand\" option, which was a tad disappointing.As for the quality of the curtain itself, while it does certainly feel like polyester, the weave does not shine excessively the way polyester fabrics tend to do. The weave does imitate a sheer linen curtain pretty decently, and turned out looking closer to it than expected. I'm concerned that the thickness/stiffness of the fabric may affect the way the curtain falls when draped, but I'll update on whether that is true or not later on down the road when I figure out how much I truly like these curtains.The stitching seems to be of pretty decent quality, I received the version which gives you a rod pocket on the bottom and fabric slats on the top. I was concerned after reading reviews for the tab version after purchasing, which said the tabs were sewn together poorly, however they seem to be seen together very nicely! Another review had dictated the tag for the product was in an inopportune location on the panels, directly below the tabs, however I believe the tabs are not actually supposed to be visible and thus the tags won't be either. I will still likely end up ripping them out, as they only dictate the country of origin and contain no important information such as washing instructions, and I don't want the tabs to cause a visible shadow when looking through the curtain.Overall, I'd say these are pretty good linen imitations, but to be honest it may be a good idea to just spend a little extra money on proper sheer-linen-curtains. I'm a little disappointed in the color difference between the listing I purchased and what I received, but I'm willing to wait until I see them in daylight to make a true call on my judgement of the color.You get what you pay for, and this is the cheaper option, so take all of this with a grain of salt. There is much quite a difference between these and real sheer-linen-curtains, but if you're willing to put those differences aside, these may be a good option for you.",

                "reviewText": "I ditched my fabric cordless blinds for these curtains and am so happy I did. They look great and are even better than I expected. They let light into the kitchen, but are enough coverage that you can\u2019t see right through the window from outside because I got a bigger size for the layered look. Highly recommend!",

I was sad they didn\u2019t match what I envisioned for my space. I returned them and got my refund back so fast! I am so grateful for that. I was so excited so I reordered these in white! If you want a warm cozy feel, these are perfect.",
