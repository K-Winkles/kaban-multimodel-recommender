                "reviewText": "I have been searching the internet for almost 2 years to find the best, affordable, and luxurious looking white blackout curtains for my living room. I have a big window that gets direct sunlight during the day and makes it hard to see the TV. I didn\u2019t want to cover my big windows with just anything. I originally bought the Pottery Barn Broadway 100% cotton curtains to do the job and they were awful! They looked like paint drop clothes hung over my windows. Way over priced for terrible quality. Then, I found these recommended by a blogger on Pinterest. They aren\u2019t the white I originally wanted, but the Natural color blends very well to the whites, creams, and tans I have throughout the decor of my home. They steam out easily with a Conair hand steamer, which was another issue I had with the Pottery Barn curtains, the wrinkles would not come out no matter what I did. These curtains have a stiff (but not too stiff) feel and the edges look nice a crisp. They are also not extremely heavy. So, you don\u2019t necessarily need a heavy duty rod. They do a great job blocking the sun. I am happy with them and they were a fraction of the cost of expensive curtains, such as Pottery Barn. I used tradition curtain hooks and rings to hang. If you are pick about the look of curtains like me, you can trust these ones.",

These blackout curtains do a good job of blocking light for day sleepers while being light enough in color to not make a room noticeably darker when they are pulled open. To me, it's the best of both worlds so one can have the darkness needed for sleep while having curtains that don't greatly interfere with light when you want it. They have a special top design which provides three hanging options: 1) A basic rod pocket top that allows for a modern touch, 2) the back loops which add an elegant flair 3) use clip rings for easy, slide open and closed (clip rings are not included). They are attractive in a subtle way and feel like linen to the touch. They are substantial curtains that are well made with properly tensioned stitching.",
