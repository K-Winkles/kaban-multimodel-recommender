                "reviewText": "I really like the curtains. They let light in but you cannot see in and out of the room clearly. This bedroom is on the street side, so that is what I wanted. The ONLY reason for the lower score was the wrinkles. I washed them in cold water and used low heat in the dryer. They came out with the same wrinkles that they arrived with. I put them back in the dryer with ice and selected \"wrinkle remove\" on my dryer. No change. I had to iron them with starch on the polyester setting. Even then, I had to go over ever single wrinkle 8-10 times each before they started to disappear. It took me 80 min to iron and hang the 4 panels. I am 70 yrs old and have purchased MANY curtains in my life. These were the only ones to have these issues. The bottom line is that they do look great BUT you will need to iron them (possibly steam them but I did not attempt that option) for a longer time than you might want! I would take off a star due to the wrinkle issues.",

The only thing I find is that it is not really what I would consider to be semi-sheer. I have a different curtain from another seller that is truly semi-sheer. I can faintly see what is behind that curtain, which is what I wanted with this one but didn't quite get. Perhaps everyone's idea of semi-sheer is different. However, it was $20, it keeps the hot sun out and people can't see in so it's doing the job. I didn't iron it before hanging it up and it does have a few wrinkles from being folded that I thought might go away but I may end up ironing if that starts to bug me.",

They are exactly what i needed, sheer enough to let the light in, even maybe getting the room more clear and keeping the two women who live in front of me to stare in my room when they smoke outside on their balcony...They are lovely in the room, well made, no problem at all with them and the texture...wow, just wow. Keep making them, i need more hehe.Update...Wow what is this price increase? It went from 33.99$ from 89.94$!!!!... Yep, for same size and model. I wanted to buy more but I am not interested at this price. I'll go elsewhere.",
