These are a good weight (not sheer) and very expensive looking. They do not wrinkle and stay dirt free for the most part. The water just rolls off of them as well which is an added plus. Great purchase!",

Bought these curtains as a way to replicate being in a Hawaiian oasis. They worked beautifully. Attached them to shower rods inside our arbor and they fall to the perfect length. Not see through which is what I wanted. We get pelted by the sun in the late afternoon and having these curtains to open up and block the sun is the perfect retreat.",

I bought these to replace the IKEA curtains I had on my deck. IKEA curtains were more like a netting then a curtain (then again you get what you pay for) and were ultimately destroyed by squirrels... The bane of my existence. These curtains are of very good quality. Thick enough to bear the storm yet soft enough to beautify your space. I loved that I did not have to use clips to put these up. Instead they have Velcro tabs that are easy to put up and remove for washing. I\u2019m so so pleased with this purchase.",
