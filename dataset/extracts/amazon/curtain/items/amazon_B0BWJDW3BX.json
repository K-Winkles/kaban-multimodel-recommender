I wanted to hang the curtains a little above the header so I purchased curtain clips, which give them a very professionally made look. They are soft, well made, and a great addition to our space. They work perfectly, and I would highly recommend these curtains. They are not lined, so if you are looking for a heavier curtain, these are not the curtains for you. I do like, however, these allow light to pass through but filter the light with a very nice color. They are better than I expected.",
