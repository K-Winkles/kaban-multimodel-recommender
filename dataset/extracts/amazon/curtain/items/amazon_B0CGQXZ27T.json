                "reviewText": "These curtains are luxurious and high quality. I live in the Northeast and they have been wonderful in helping to block the cold and retain heat. It has a thermal backing.The fabric and backing are quality. Not at all what I would expect at this affordable price point, for two panels.I have a cat and I have not noticed any issues with the curtains collecting fur. Which is a huge PLUS with these curtains panels.The curtains were on back order, but came in a few weeks ahead of schedule.Highly recommend these Curtains and have had no issues dealing with this company.",
