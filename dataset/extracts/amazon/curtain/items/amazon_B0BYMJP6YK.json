Since I\u2019ve invested in these curtains, I feel like my sleep has improved dramatically and I wake up refreshed. I found that even though I didn\u2019t have lot of white and didn\u2019t have blackout curtains, the moonlight and starlight created a lot of disruption in my need for total darkness in my sleep. So, if you were someone who needs total darkness and wants to invest in an aesthetically pleasing curtain, I don\u2019t think you could go wrong with these.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the INOVADAY 100% Blackout Curtains for my bedroom and let me tell you, these curtains are truly a game-changer. As someone who loves to sleep in a completely dark room, these curtains have been a dream come true. The thermal insulation keeps the room at the perfect temperature, making it perfect for those hot summer nights. And the fact that they come in a set of two panels is an added bonus, making it easier to cover my large bedroom windows.One thing I will say is that I made the mistake of ordering the bright white color. While they look stunning and add a touch of elegance to my room, they do show wrinkles quite easily. However, a quick ironing session took care of that issue and they now look perfect. In hindsight, I would recommend going for a darker color to avoid this minor inconvenience.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend the INOVADAY blackout curtains to anyone looking for a good night's sleep. They are thick, durable, and truly live up to their promise of complete darkness. Trust me, your sleep schedule will thank you for investing in these curtains.",
