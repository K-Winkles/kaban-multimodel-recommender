                "reviewText": "These curtains are BEAUTIFUL!I ordered the dark olive green and have ZERO regrets! The color is so rich and gorgeous. We are making over a guest room. The bedding I chose is a rich creamy white and mossy greens. These curtains pull out the darker green in the bedding. So beautiful! I can't wait to get the walls painted (Color is Valspar Hopsack) so I can hang the curtains and put the whole look together. I am very happy with the weight of the curtains and the lining is very nice. There are several hanging options on the back of each panel (see pictures). Two panels are included with each set.The reason I gave 4/5 stars is because the rings are plastic and the clips are a very lightweight metal. I'm not sure how well they'll hold up over time and was disappointed the rings weren't metal. Also, although the various hanging options on the back of the panels are great to have, the material used to hang the curtains \"tab\" style is constructed of multiple very thin strings - not a solid tab. Again, how well will this design hold up over time?Overall, I am so pleased with the overall appearance of the curtain panels - color saturation, linen look - that I will absolutely make them work in our space and know they will be gorgeous in our newly remodeled guest room!",
