In the photo, the first image is without them closed and the second photo, is of course, with them closed.There is a little light coming in, only because I didn\u2019t pull them fully closed. The material is super durable and heavy, but doesn\u2019t weigh down the curtain rod. Perfect light oatmeal color that looks perfect with my rustic white bedroom furniture. The only thing you\u2019ll need to do is steam the curtains since they were packed so well. ;)",
