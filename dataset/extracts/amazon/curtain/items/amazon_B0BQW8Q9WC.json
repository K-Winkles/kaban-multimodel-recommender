                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the INOVADAY 100% Black Out Curtains (96 inches long) in beige, and they have been a game-changer for my home. The curtains arrived neatly packaged, with clear care instructions, which I appreciated.* Quality & Material: The first thing I noticed was the quality of the material. The linen fabric feels durable yet has a soft touch, adding a hint of luxury to the overall look. The beige color is true to the images online, providing a warm, neutral tone that complements various decor styles, from boho to farmhouse.Blackout & Insulation: Living in a busy city, I needed curtains that could effectively block out the light. These curtains do just that. They provide complete blackout, perfect for late sleepers or those who require a dark room. Moreover, the thermal insulation is impressive.* Size & Fit: The dimensions (W50 x L96) are accurate, making them a perfect fit for my tall windows. They drape beautifully, giving a full, elegant look.* Ease of Use: Installing these curtains was straightforward. They slid easily onto my curtain rods, and the weight of the fabric ensures they hang neatly without any fuss.* Overall Look: The curtains have uplifted the aesthetic of my rooms. They add a sense of sophistication and coziness, transforming the spaces into more inviting areas.",

                "reviewText": "I wasn't sure what to expect from these... I have tried other blackout curtains from similarly priced comparable companies, and they always end up looking ridiculously cheap while also being great at blackout. I wanted sometime that looked great and worked well. One review complained they come \"too wrinkled\"... apparently, they have never experienced 100% real linen drapes out of the packaging because no amount of ironing will do it lol.. these came out with some wrinkles, but after a good ironing on the wool setting with steam they came out nearly wrinkle free, which I found shocking.. they are a nice muted beige.. they are not light gray as some have complained, but they are not a warm beige either.. for me its a perfect middle ground. For those wondering about the texture... they have a nice weight to them that real linen curtains do not have so they hang well for blackout especially... now to the feel of them.. ok they feel nothing like linen... you can tell they are a high quality polyester when you touch them... but how often are people running their hands over your curtains that aren't you... and who really cares... it doesn't feel bad... Even better they have no odor to them as many poly items often do... But the truly important part is how do they look visually... and this is where these really earn high marks... They look so good... I have them in a bedroom with walls slightly darker from the same color palette and it creates a wonderful peaceful environment in my bedroom... I would absolutely recommend these for the price.",

I am a seamstress and the size is accurate, seams are straight and overall quality construction.

I have a 10ft window therefore I had to buy 2 for a total of 4 panels. Unfortunately none of these were the same, first ones were at least an inch shorter than the 2nd, the 3rd time I ordered the front was shorter than the back, the 4th there was a tear in the backing make light come through in just this one spot which was to me very noticeable. Finally the 5th order matched the 2nd length and I was able to send back the rest. Overall the end product was good but it was definitely a hassle to get there. If you window is smaller and you only need the 2 panels, or 1 order, you shouldn\u2019t have any issues. There is also a lot of wrinkle right out of the package I put them in the dryer with a damp towel and ran the de-wrinkle cycle 2-3 time which helped. Also the longer they hang the better they look as far a wrinkles go. Hopes this helps!",

The sun comes right in in the morning (so lovely, but some mornings we just aren't prepared to be blinded). My fiance wanted blackout curtains and these are TRUE blackout curtains! Like everyone else says, just throw them in the dryer on tumble with a dryer sheet to rid of the wrinkles & plastic packaging smell. We used the o-rings w/ the clips it came with to hang ours on a rod. I love this look, just may take a bit for you to find the perfect spacing between the rings when clasping the hooks on the curtain so it folds/waves real nice while hanging. The rings and the curtains are fantastic quality & there's no doubt they'll last a while. Also true to color when ordering off here! I imagine if we ever have to wash them they'll be a simple wash, too. I don't have anything bad to say they're just wonderful!",
