Additionally, the package includes bonus 1 tieback and detachable 3 butterfly bow ties. The kids curtain has grommets with a 1.6 inch inner diameter, and each panel measures 52\" wide.",
            "[DOUBLE-SIDED PATTERN]: Unlike plain silver backing, this double-sided pattern features the same design on both the front and back. This results in a beautiful and romantic girls curtain that looks stunning from both inside and outside the room.",
            "[UNIQUE DESIGN]: These girls room curtains have a unique design that includes two layers. The inner layer has star-shaped cutouts, and the outer layer is made of tulle lace. The edges and corners are impeccably cut using high-tech hollow technology, leaving the star shape clear and intact. When sunlight shines through, the stars emit a luminous glow, creating a mesmerizing, dream-like starry sky effect visible through the screen.",
            "[ROMANTIC LOOK]: This mermaid curtain has a romantic and elegant appearance, with a white voile layer that covers a blackout curtain. The voile layer gives the curtain a dreamy and delicate look, instantly livening up any home decor. The blackout fabric provides room darkening and privacy, while the sheer panel adds an airy and light feel to the room. Together, these features create a perfect balance of functionality and aesthetics.",
            "[CARE INSTRUCTIONS]: To properly care for our two-layered curtain, we recommend machine washing it in a gentle cycle and cold water. Use a warm iron to remove any wrinkles, and tumble dry the curtain on a low heat setting."

I was a little surprised that you had to pin the bows on the curtain yourself, but I like that I was able to choose their positioning, and it came with the safety pins used to do so. The curtain is very good quality, and the star cut out are adorable! It is not a blackout curtain due to the cut outs, but even during daylight it easily limits the light by at least 80%. The picture I uploaded was taken with full sun at around 7 PM. I only purchased one curtain because the wall in the nursery is small and the width of the curtains gave plenty of room to cover a full standard size window.",

I was wondering why it didn't fit like it was supposed to but that's because apparently I was supposed to order two. Here I thought I was just getting a really good deal but now I have to order another one. Also the \"bows\" are really cheap looking. They look nothing like the picture and they just come with three bows and three safety pins to pin them on. I probably won't even end up using them. The fabric of the curtain itself does seem to be nice and kind of heavy and it does seem to do a good job blocking out light at least better than the ones I had on there so I'm glad about that but annoyed that I have to buy another one and wait for it to get here and then I will have to purchase two more for my other window. All in all I'm ending up paying over $90 just to cover two windows.",
