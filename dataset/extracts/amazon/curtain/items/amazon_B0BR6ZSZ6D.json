                "reviewText": "The linen-like fabric is attractive. It's very sheer but that is irrelevant because the liner is thick. It completely darkens the room -- except where sewn. Little dots of light show through. It would be a challenge to buy the fabric for the cost of the finished product (about $60 for a pair of 63 inch curtains when I bought them), so I consider them a very good value. They are not perfect. I purchased five pair and a few had slightly uneven hems and/or the blackout curtain liner didn't line up with the linen front perfectly. I had to hem them, so this was more of an annoyance to me than it would be to the typical customer.I bought a few initially as a try-out so that if I didn't like them, I would have less to return. The first shipment came quickly; the second sat at the \"ordered, not shipped\" status for about a week. Perhaps those sets came directly from China. Check delivery date: prime didn't mean two day delivery from the time of order. (But yes, once they showed as 'shipped' then it was two days and they did come on the date predicted.)",

These definitely look like much higher end curtains. Just buy them.",

We needed a lot of curtains to cover 2 whole walls of windows, and we also needed to stay within budget! I wanted something pleated that looked high end without paying for a designer label, and these curtains are it! Worth every penny! Looks exactly like something from Pottery Barn but a fraction of the price. The quality is top notch! The pleats are well made, and I love that they are weighted at the bottom! I did have to steam A LOT of wrinkles out when I first hung them up, but that's to be expected. In the end, they were exactly what I envisioned for the room. If you're debating, get them! You will not find a better value for the price! I will definitely be recommending these to future clients, and I may even find a window or two in my own home that need them. Overall, these were a great buy!",
