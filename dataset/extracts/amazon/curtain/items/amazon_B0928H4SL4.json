The size in the product description is for a single panel. Such as: Size: 42W x 63L = 42 inches wide by 63 inches long for each panel, one order is for 2 panels. How to choose the right curtain width for full and complete coverage? Choose width 2 times than your window wide. Note: Grommets top may cause folds and reduce curtain width when hung. How to choose the right curtain length to prevent light leakage through rings? Measure from the top of your curtain rod to the bottom edge of window. Select curtains that are longer than this measurement. Note: Ensure curtain rod is positioned at least 3 inches above window top. Why is the color of the curtains I received a little different from when I browsed? Hi, there is a slight difference in the color of the curtains due to different display devices or lighting. How can I remove wrinkles from these curtains? A quick steaming iron on the back side can effectively smooth out any wrinkles. Or the wrinkles will disappear after hanging few days.",

They are very heavy and silky. We purchased them because every neighbor around us has a floodlight that shines into our windows on every side of our house. And although we do not do that, it is better to find a solution to the problem without starting discontent with our neighbors. These black out all of the floodlights along with a streetlight that shines into our bedroom. Problem solved with peace in the neighborhood! I can only guess they have these in Alaska where the sun is up well into the nighttime hours.",

                "reviewText": "These curtains certainly do the job when it comes to blocking out daylight! They are sturdy, the black lining is very heavy, and it darkens the room. They are easy to hang, easy to open and close by sliding on a rod, and they hang beautifully. My only complaint is that from the outside of the house you can see a glaring white stripe down the middle of the window from the white fabric that's on the inside of the curtain wrapping around the black. It just doesn't look nice from the outside of the house.",

                "reviewText": "Rating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2606 (4/5)The BGment Thermal Insulated 100% Blackout Curtains make it simple to transform your bedroom into a relaxing retreat. Having used these curtains myself, I can vouch to their capacity to improve sleep quality, improve the appearance of the room, and lessen the amount of noise that can be heard outside the room. These curtains are an all-around option for individuals trying to create a quiet and elegant home because of its modern style, thermal insulation, and noise-reducing qualities.Five-Star Blackout and Thermal Insulation:The BGment Blackout Curtains' excellent blackout capacity is one of their most striking features. With these curtains pulled, nearly no outside light will enter the room thanks to the double-layer construction and the black liner. Those who are photosensitive or who need total darkness to have good sleep may appreciate this amenity. The drapes' ability to insulate heat also helps keep the space at a pleasant temperature. Over time, you may be able to save money on your utility bills thanks to their ability to keep the area at a more comfortable temperature year-round.Reducing Background Noise (4.5/5)The BGment's ability to dampen ambient noise The added allure of blackout drapes is notable. Despite their limitations, they do an excellent job of dampening outside noise and making the inside of a building more peaceful and relaxing. Those who reside in congested cities or in close proximity to busy thoroughfares would benefit greatly from this. The environment is more relaxing and pleasant because to the noise-cancelling features.*Design* and *aesthetics* (4 out of 5 stars)The greyish white color of the BGment Blackout Curtains is a modern and versatile choice for any home's decor. Curtains with grommets are lightweight, simple to hang, and simple to slide along a rod. The curtains have a soft texture that is just noticeable enough to be eye-catching. The design is adaptable and elegant, but it may lack the complexity and visual appeal of other curtain choices.Coverage and Dimensions (4.5/5):The BGment Blackout Curtains are perfect for ordinary windows, as each panel is a generous 42 inches by 84 inches. There are two panels in the set, so most windows may be covered in full. The space looks more refined thanks to the elegant drape created by the ample dimensions of the drapes. Keep in mind that more panels may be needed for floor-to-ceiling or particularly large window installations.Maintenance and Setup (5/5):The BGment Blackout Curtains' grommet design makes them compatible with a wide variety of curtain rods, making installation a breeze. The curtains can be taken down quickly and easily, whether for cleaning or to be replaced with something else. The curtains are machine-washable, so there's no need to spend time hand-washing them to keep them looking good.Pricing/Value (4.5/5):The BGment Blackout Curtains are a good buy because of the multiple benefits they provide, including total darkness, warmth, and quiet. Although they may be more expensive than standard curtains, the room's comfort, appearance, and sleep quality will be greatly enhanced by their installation.**Summary:**The BGment Thermal Insulated 100% Blackout Curtains are the perfect addition to any bedroom because of its fashionable design, practical features, and cozy construction. The blackout and thermal insulation properties, as well as the noise reduction capability, make for an ideal sleeping environment. The curtains are a sensible option for anyone wishing to spruce up their living area because of its adaptable style, simple installation, and low maintenance needs. The BGment Blackout Curtains are a solid option for individuals looking for an all-in-one solution for their window treatment needs, despite the fact that the design isn't the most detailed and some users may prefer even more noise reduction.",
