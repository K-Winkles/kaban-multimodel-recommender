                "reviewText": "I ordered on May 7th, arrived on May 13th. Shipped from the US. I ordered 2 of the Tricia Thermal Patio Door Panel, 100\" x 84\", Grey to use on my large living room window, which is approximately 8ft wide. Generally I need 4+ wide curtain panels to cover it, but that leads to many gaps between them that let a lot of light in when I don't want it. I purchased two of these to avoid some of those gaps and paired it with a room darkening curtain rod. Quite effective, if you keep in mind that these are room-darkening and not meant to be total blackout. The grommets are decent quality feeling, but plastic. They slide well when opening and closing.Comparing to my old Eclipse brand thermal curtains (the ones that had the rubbery layer on the back that peels, cracks and stick together in the heat), they are as effective at room darkening (even considering my previous ones were black with a thermal coating, and these are lighter grey without coating!) but I cannot yet compare to the thermal aspect. They also look nicer than the previous eclipse brand ones I had.I can also compare to another brand of curtains I've purchased off of Amazon and like, DecoNovo. These Eclipse curtains feel just slightly lower quality than the DecoNovo ones do; these are slightly less room darkening (but again, that is comparing black to these grey), slightly less silky feeling - these are a little rough in comparison. Deconovo are also made of a slightly heavier feeling material. All around if DecoNovo were A+, then these would be an A- in terms of look, effectiveness, and feel. Considering that the DecoNovo brand of the same size and style was significantly more expensive than these, I can live with the quality and price I paid.Overall, I am pleased with these and would recommend.",
