                "reviewText": "These are a made from a good quality and relatively thick fabric which block a good amount of sunlight but if you\u2019re seeking true blackout drapes, you will need to be creative to achieve a completely dark room with these as they are not lined at all. Since the seller indicated these drapes aren\u2019t true blackout within the description, I purchased a blackout reflective panel that adheres to the window with Velcro adhesive strips and prior to hanging the drapes, applied it to the glass.I\u2019ve never liked the texture of blackout drapes as they feel stiff and plasticky so I opted for a solution that allowed for a richer aesthetic. Obviously these drapes remain closed since the glass has been fitted with a heat reflective panel in order to keep out the desert heat here in Las Vegas, where I live.I am extremely happy with these beautiful velvet drapes and love how they hang, feel, look PLUS they deliver exactly what I was hoping for.The color is perfect and I was torn between several options. I took several weeks of looking at different types of fabrics, colors and at every seller on Amazon to finally make my decision. I was originally going to use a linen fabric with blackout panels sewn into the backing but when I came across these I began to rethink it altogether. I could not be more satisfied with my choice to change the fabric to velvet and to go with a color I\u2019d not considered at all. The stone blue is very forgiving as it has a slightly green hue and is a sneaky \u201ccolor shifting\u201d shade that would fit just about any pallet. The room is predominantly furnished with dark blues and a plush multicolored area rug with a cream/off white background, the carpet\u2019s muted blues, greens and pastel reddish pink touches just look lovely with these rich velvet, flowing drapes.Upon arrival I threw these in the washer, I bought 2 packages so all 4 panels went in on the \u201cbulky\u201dcycle with warm water. Since they\u2019re polyester I expected no shrinkage. I dried them partially, leaving them slightly damp and hung them immediately. This technique works on heavier fabrics to remove most wrinkles as the weight itself aids in removing fold marks. I employed a hand held steamer (if you don\u2019t own one, get one as it\u2019ll change your life) to get out any stubborn wrinkles. I cannot imagine a better result. You don\u2019t need an expensive steamer as they all use the same technology and I use it frequently instead of an iron.One thing I noticed while setting out on this journey of drape buying online, is that the same exact products are sold by many merchants and prices are definitely not consistent. I found myself chasing my tail when looking for that elusive best price. The day after I hung my drapes, a different seller had the same drapes at a 40% lower price. The photos and diagrams are identical from one vendor to the next plus the color charts and names of each color are the same. To say I felt disappointed to find that had I waited a day to save 40% Is an understatement. But I\u2019d hung the drapes and I work alone and it\u2019s a tricky process when hanging heavier fabric. As I\u2019m not an acrobat and will not allow my husband to be involved, as that quickly becomes a liability due to using a \u201cmansplain\u201d translation decoder ring and putting us in the crosshairs of divorce, I quickly realized that forgetting about losing out on saving some money was not all that important.I highly recommend these and if you are considering a divorce, to get that ball rolling, ask your spouse to \u201cassist\u201d which will likely bring out your inner Cujo.Arrived when promised but mediocrely packaged. Mine were fineYes- order them.",

                "reviewText": "I bought 2 packs, (4 panels total), 108 inch, in the color; bleach white. I was nervous about the color and weight as I was ordering them but was pleasantly surprised when they arrived! The color is pure white - just as I wanted, and looked great against my off - white walls. I hung them in my living room that is beige, tan, & white (with color accents). The fabric is not a real velvet (I have to say that to be honest) but they are a wonderful soft, velvety like, textured material. The panels have a good weight and are constructed nicely with a nice bottom pocket hem. The wrinkles steamed out pretty easy with my small portable hand steamer. A few remaining wrinkles that I could not reach shook out in a few days. Lastly, the curtains are opaque enough that you can\u2019t see in my living room from the outside, but allows a good amount of filtered light in so the room is not blacked out. I highly recommend these curtains and would buy them again.",

                "reviewText": "FIrst I have to say that I love these curtains. I have two 59\" wide windows that I purchased two sets (4 panels per window) for each. The windows are alongside a fireplace and I wanted to pull the curtains to the far side of the windows and keep them drawn to the sides. After putting them up I noticed that a few of the panels were noticeably shorter than the others. We tried adjusting the rod height (I purchased the 108\" L) but that adjustment made the discrepancy noticeable from the top. I decided that I wanted more fullness so I purchased two additional sets, and I'm hoping that doubling what I already had will help with the differences in the lengths of the individual panels. Even though this ended up being more than I had intended to spend, I'm happy with the purchase because the material and overall look of the product is high end and attractive. To make this the right purchase for me, I had to place 8 panels (4 sets) on each 59\" w rod.*********So the extra panels came in. We added those and the length problem persists. The panels are not all the same length (most are off about an inch to two inches). Even the single panels have some issues with one end at the bottom being higher and this is because the hem on some of the panels is uneven.",
