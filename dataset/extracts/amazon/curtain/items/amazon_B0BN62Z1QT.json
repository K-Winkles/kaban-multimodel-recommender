The definitely look just like linen but without the wrinkling. I was able to hang them right out of the package and they are wrinkle free. The drape on them is perfect. They are not sheer but are light filtering. They look way more expensive than they were. I used 2 sets of the 84 inch length on my 74 inch wide window and it gives the right amount of fullness I wanted. They also drape so nicely with tiebacks. I am obsessed with these curtains. I researched for days and decided on these and I couldn't be happier.",

The color is just what I wanted-natural and the stitching creates dramatic effect but not overwhelming. I wanted natural light to come in but also give privacy. You definitely have that during the day. At night you are able to see through the curtains so if you want complete privacy i would layer with something.",

The curtains are light and airy and will be tied back most of time but they can be closed for privacy if needed. Replacing the black curtains has really brightened up the kitchen. Now my dilemma is do I keep the black valances or switch the valance out too. I ordered a Waverly valance called Navarra in antique color and I think it will look good but my husband prefers the old valance. Decisions . Decisions. Bottom line is the curtains were a great purchase. I got the cute rope tibacks on Amazon too.",
