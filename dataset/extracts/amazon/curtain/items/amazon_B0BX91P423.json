                "reviewText": "I debated whether or not to order these based on the reviews. I'm very glad I ordered. I'm not sure why some people say they do not block the light as I can only figure it depends on what colors you order and if you have any other window treatments. I ordered two pair in Navy for my bedroom and a pair in the Cappuccino for a guest bedroom. Upon installation, both rooms are now completely dark when the drapes are closed. We do have top down/bottom up, light filtering window shades in our windows as well but we needed something to block out morning light and the neighbor's post lamps that shine into our bedroom overnight when the shades are closed. Here's what I honestly think: I had a hard time finding premade drapes in the exact size I needed (66x72) and color, so these were perfect. I did not have any issues with hems being uneven or bad stitching as other reviews mentioned. Construction and material quality was great. The material is a thick or dense polyester (at least in the colors I purchased). In fact, the Cappuccino material seemed even thicker than the Navy. Upon arrival I put them in the dryer with a damp towel and that took care of the wrinkles for the most part. I figured once they were hanging, the remaining wrinkles will work themselves out and they have. They are a basic curtain that are casual but give off a more polished look. They're not luxurious by any means but they don't look 'cheap' either. They really worked our perfectly for what we wanted. We found they definitely provided complete room darkening (with our shades also closed) and we live in New England and during the winter, they definitely helped keep the room warmer. I am pleased with the purchase and would buy again.",

I am in love with these curtains. The Dark Mallard is so pretty. And the texture?!?!? Sooooo soft! I cannot put my finger on what it feels it\u2026satin like maybe? And they have such a perfect weight, I would say maybe medium weight, which is what I wanted. The stitching is clean and neat. I did iron mine to remove the wrinkles and it looks stunning. As for blackout, they definitely do block the light. And as for color\u2026I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty darn close, maybe like 95% close, which is fine\u2026 I\u2019m definitely buying more for the rest of my house.",
