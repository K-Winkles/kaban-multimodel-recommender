                "reviewText": "There is no door between my master bedroom and the bathroom and I was trying to find something I can use as a divider until I came across these string curtains and I ordered them right away. I'm glad I did because the result was exactly what I needed, I used a short shower curtain rod to put them on, the deep pocket is wide enough for the rod and easy to slide, the curtain's length is good enough, I can still trim the bottom but I don't have to since it is not bothering me.My only one complaint is that the curtains are a bit smelly but it is getting better after a little bit over a week of use.",

                "reviewText": "We moved in the furniture from our sunroom for the winter, and wanted to camouflage the sliding glass door a tad, without hiding it completely for the rare sunny day. And, these did not disappoint. I got four total, and that was just the right amount. Under $30, such a bargain. Easy to install. Word to the wise, they are flimsy, so don't step on one as you're putting them up. But aren't they simply adorable?",
