I've only just put them up and it is night and the camera on my phone does not do the rich color they are justice. I am very happy with the quality, the material is luxurious feeling and a good weight and well sewn. They stop the small draft thatcomes from that window (100 yr old house) and make the room more comfy as well as prettier. The window glass is 31\" wide and I am glad I got the 52\" width, the 84\" falls to just above the carpet which is perfect. I love the look of curtains draping onto the floor but did not get them longer as I was worried one of our cats might decide to nap on them or something bad! Delighted with these curtains and love the color.",

I love the way they look in my room. They are pretty thick and function well as blackout curtains. I'd say they block about 95% of the light, around the same as any other blackout curtains I've owned. The olive green has mustard/gold undertones, which looks perfect with my decor. Very happy with how these turned out.",

Just enough that they hang beautifully. And yes, they are definitely blackout drapes. We just had a cold spell where it was in the teens at night and the room that has these hung up was warmer. No drafts felt at all when these drapes were closed. I was not expecting that. They worked better than drapes I paid 3x as much for. I'm definitely getting another pair for my guest room. Easy to hang, not wrinkled at all, definitely blackout drapes and an excellent value for the money.",

The only problem I have is that the bottom is not even at ALL, I will have to lower the curtain rod to make them puddle on the floor so you won\u2019t be able to tell, but that\u2019s just annoying lol. Other than that they are so worth the money.",

They're so beautiful and well exceed the quality I expected of the price...I just might have to redecorate more rooms with more of these curtains. Buy at your own risk. I'll be back \ud83d\ude02*The dark green blocks light very well. It does cast a reddish glow when the sunlight is direct, so It's not truly blackout in my opinion, BUT it's pretty darn close. I don't think a lighter color would be as effective for blocking light though.",
