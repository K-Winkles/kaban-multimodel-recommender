                "reviewText": "I waited several weeks before writing a review to make sure my opinion wouldn't change of these curtains. I have bought a few different \"Black Out\" curtains from stores and off the internet but have never been fully satisfied with the amount of light it blacks out. I work 3rd shift and have to have a really dark room to be able to sleep and I also get some pretty bad migraines which require me to be in a very dark room. I was very cautious when buying these only due to how many times I've been disappointed previously with black out curtains. I have to say these are by far the best curtains I have ever seen yet. It literally blocks out 100% of the light in my bedroom and we get A LOT of sun in the early mornings. I bought hooks and a rod that sits close to the wall so no lights shines out along the sides. The only hint of light is from the top but thats expected. Hang them slightly higher and it solves most of that issue. I'm absolutely in love with these. My boyfriend complains that he now sleeps too late and misses going to the gym early now because of these curtains. haha My cat sleeps with us and the moment the light hits our room she tries to wake us up. As weird as it is she doesn't try to wake us up in the mornings now, which I wasn't expecting at all so that was an extra bonus for me. :pThe material isn't and does not feel cheap as I read someone else stated in their review. Its pretty heavy duty unlike my previous drapes. The material is very soft and hangs beautifully. There are 2 different ways to hand the drapes as well. Through the material or through the loops hidden on the back. I went through the material to have it lay closer to the wall. These drapes were delivered VERY quickly, packaged well and when I pulled them out of the package I expected them to have a ton of wrinkles I would have to try and get out. NOPE! There was maybe one or two very small creases but this material doesn't seem to wrinkle. I didnt have to iron or put in the dryer at all. Just hung them and boom, done.I bought the black ones and my boyfriend and I even held bright lights and what not behind the drapes and we couldn't see any hint of light behind them. We love them so much we plan on buying more in different colors and replacing the rest of the curtains in our entire house. Not only to block out the light but because they look amazing and some of our family and friends stated they looked very expensive. It has gotten into winter season here where we live and we've noticed out bedroom seems to stay slightly warmer now with them as well. So they do seem to block the cold or heat from outside.Best curtains.. ever =)",

                "reviewText": "I couldn't have been happier hanging these curtains!I purchased two sets of the black colored curtains along with 2 Levolor Sphere Rod Set, Brushed Sienna, 3/4-Inch Diameter, 36 to 66-Inch Width . Shipping was free, and quick, all items arrived within 6 days! Thank you again Amazon!These curtains are as promised, black out.. It was noon in the high Colorado mountains where I live with no clouds in view when I installed these on my two bedroom windows, which face south towards the sun. Once I closed them, the only light I could see through the curtains was by standing a few inches from them and seeing very few tiny pinholes of light, similar to faint stars in the darkest night sky. Standing more than a few inches away, you see no light aside from what bleeds through the top/bottom/sides depending on how close you installed them to the wall. I used the Levolor Curtain Rod Set linked above and they hold the curtains from the wall approximately 2 inches, so there is a very small band of outside light on the top of these curtains, but only due to the curtain rod I used. The room, even with these bands of light, was still extremely dark for noon on a bright day.The curtains I received came with two tie backs per set, the same black fabric fashioned into approximately 5 inch wide straps with two white cord rings sewn at either end to affix to tieback holders. The top of the curtains have two hanging options. You can either stick the curtain rod through the entire top of the curtain, or there are about 8 loops on each curtain so they can appear more like pleated drapes with large, soft pleats when bunched together. This is a great advantage, depending on window width and style you want to have. Speaking of style, as these are made from polyester, they could have a \"pooling\" effect if you hang them to where the lower length of the curtains can \"pool\" on the floor making a satin-like curtain pillar on either side of your window. Also, due to being polyester, once you remove them from the bag to hang, the wrinkles disappear after a day or so, so no need to iron these prior to hanging. The curtains also came in a small, reusable zippered storage bag :o)All in all I have no regrets with these and I am planning on buying more sets in other colors for my children's rooms soon. Highly recommended! At a decent price, and a multitude of colors to choose from, you can't go wrong with these, no matter what room/window you're updating.",

                "reviewText": "I had bought tan colored blackout curtains for my son's room from a big box baby store, but got these in the light blue for my room. These blackout curtains in light blue worked so much better than the other curtain's in my son's room that I took his down and bought him these blackout curtains in chocolate brown color- they are SOOOOO much better than the curtains from the baby store (and way less expensive). The brown curtains in his room are so dark now that I can't even see him when I peak my head in (like I used to be able to) -I have to use my iPhone flashlight. I used to be able to read books to him at night with the light from around previous curtains and now I can't at all bc it is so dark. I bought these curtains in light blue for one of the two windows in my room and was so immediately impressed by the blackout effect- my husband was worried if we put them on both windows that we wouldn't wake up for work the next day and once I got them all both windows it is seriously so dark!!! I love them, both of the end rooms on our house get a ton of afternoon sun and these definitely decrease the temperature in the room. Both the the light blue and dark brown work great and I love the colors. The light blue is very pretty, true blue not aqua or purple and the brown in a very pretty chocolate brown. Most surprisingly these are soft and light and feel wonderful as opposed to the previous curtains in my son's room which were heavy and stiff. Was nervous after reading reviews but love these curtains. Would highly recommend!!!",
