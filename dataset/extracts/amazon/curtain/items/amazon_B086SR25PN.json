We're on the third floor so that wasn't much of a problem for us. Quality is great! Length is perfect! Also didn't even have to iron them, gives off a soft flowy linen look!",

I'd definitely not only recommend these curtains, but also purchase more for other rooms in the house. When the Amazon app finally allows me to upload images to accompany this review, I'll post a morning natural light image and a morning \"light on inside the room\" image as well.",

I'd preferred more of a gaberdine look; more classic is appearance and how it lays on the floor.",

I bought two pairs (after accidentally purchasing them too short, but now I\u2019ve just stuck that pair behind the tv stand and the longer ones on the outside lol) they look beautiful and aren\u2019t too heavy for the rod with both pairs on.",

They're not wrinkle-free - I mean, they're linen - So they're always going to have a texture - but a quick steam got rid of the creases from the packaging.What I love about these: They are a little heathered looking when the sun shines through them, little flecks of light brown. It acts like a privacy screen, let's like 85% of the light in, I can see outside, but no one can look in.I opted to use clips at the top instead of the pocket it has for the rod (I wanted more height) and the excess unused material on the top looks like a nice border. Very happy with these curtains.What I don't love.Now, this is not super important - you get what you pay for - but the stitching tension on the hem was a little tight so it did this light lettuce effect at the bottom and sides. This might not bother most - but I took an iron to it to lay it flat, thus stretching them out, and now the curtains lay straight across the hem.Overall - super happy with these curtains",
