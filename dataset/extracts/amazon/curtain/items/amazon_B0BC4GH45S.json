The velvet also makes them easy to slide along the curtain rod, they don\u2019t get snagged on the rod - which is a win! The only downside is they are more of a bright plum than I was hoping they would be. I was expecting a darker plum. But I still love them!",

                "reviewText": "This curtain is pretty good. But the sewing pattern they used is bad. The sewing has the bottom curling up at the edges because there wasn't enough fabric allotted. The picture shows that it shouldn't be that way. Kind of shows how cheap they are which is sad because the velvet doesn't otherwise look or feel cheap and it has a normal fabric smell. Y'all know what I mean; no factory stink.",
