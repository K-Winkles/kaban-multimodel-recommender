I decided to go ahead and buy more for my living room in the blue shade. I originally wanted the grey but they didn\u2019t have the length I wanted. I am so happy I got the blue though! It matches my room more perfectly than I expected and is more of a grey blue than a true blue! So they make the room pop! They are of great quality but the width is a little lacking IMO. I had to purchase a third set to make one of my windows look \u201cfull\u201d that\u2019s my only drawback.Nevertheless, they are a perfect fit for my rooms. I intend to buy more soon as I\u2019m doing my master bedroom. They aren\u2019t sheer but do let in a good amount of light. There\u2019s a warmth to them as they are a creamy white at the top rather than a snowy or bright white. Indeed, they transformed my rooms to appear warm and inviting. It\u2019s difficult to get \u2018sets\u2019 of panels for the price I paid for these. They are a great bang for your buck!",
