                "reviewText": "I purchased these for one room several years ago and decided to put them throughout the living areas so was thrilled to find them again. They are super high quality, really heavy - so purchase a good solid curtain rod along with - and give good light, sound, and heat insulation. The backing is a silvery gray if that matters to you. I hung all mine for a few days then steamed while up. You have the option of a rod pocket up top or the tabs that make them look more pleated. In the past I've preferred the rod pocket for gathers but I didn't try it with these because I felt they were too heavy to gather and wanted a more crisp look. The checks match up pretty well. If you're ordering multiple panels, you may have to take a moment and see which panels match best and arrange accordingly but for the most part they're pretty close. Enjoy!",

                "reviewText": "These are really nice curtains! The fabric is substantial, and has a nice texture to it. Attached pictures show 4 curtain panels over a large bank of windows in the afternoon. You can see that the pattern carries across all 4, which is something you can't always count on!They do block light, but as you can see I wouldn't call them \"blackout\". The liner is a light grey/silver, and you can see it up close and from the outside. For true blackout, you could add a blackout layer to the back. I've done that with other curtains, and it's really easy if you use clips to hang - literally just a matter of clipping them to the curtain you are already hanging (personally I like rings on the rods because I find the curtains easier to open and close than when you put the curtains directly on the rod.).A few FYIs:- IMO they need to be ironed before hanging. They come nicely folded but there are definitely fold marks if you don't iron them (I tried :-).- The curtains didn't go through a final rinse at the factory, and as a result some color came off on my hands while I was hanging. I put additional curtains in other parts of the room and did a cold water quick wash/light dry on them before hanging. It didn't change the color of the curtains and they didn't shrink, but it did make them slightly softer, which was nice. It also meant that I didn't have to iron those - grab warm out of the dryer and they're good to go!- What appears to be white isn't a bright white. It more of a light beige, as you can see in the closeup. It's a nice light neutral, but be aware that if you want pure bright white - these aren't.Great curtains, reasonable price, I recommend and would buy again.",

Barely wrinkled. Thick quality fabric. Blocks out the light. My photo of them is not the best due to lack of natural light in my apartment this time of year. But I absolutely love them and totally the French feel look I was wanting. I feel the price pf the curtains were worth it. I was worried when I looked at the measurements that I needed another panel for my balcony doors but turns out I don't. They fit perfect when pulling them closed at night (I ordered 2 packages - one panel per package). Happy with these curtains!Update: I bought 2 panels for my bedroom and love them. However now that my apartment gets the direct sun in the early mornings these curtains do no block the light well at all. I wear a face mask now. However they are good quality curtains and look amazing. They block the night lights for me just not the direct sunlight in the mornings! I still give them a 5 star!",
