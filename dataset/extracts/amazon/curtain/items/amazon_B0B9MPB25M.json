                "reviewText": "Excellent quality for 108\" curtains at this price point! Curtains at this length can be so pricey. These curtains look so much more expensive than they are. I love them. The are light filtering yet still provide privacy and have a nice heavy weight to them but look airy. The weights sewn into the bottom make them hang beautifully. Curtain hooks are included which is nice if you want to hang them on curtain rings instead of the back tabs . The only issue I have is that I ordered a second pair for more fullness and the second pair is a different color than the first. both say \"white\" but one pair is an off white, while the other pair is a pure white seen side by side they definitely differ in color. Even though natural was sold out in 108\" I think I received natural for one pair, either that or the dye lot is off. So now I'm going to order another pair so that I will have a matching set and return the pair that has the off color. All that being said, I'm not deducting a star because of the color snafu, stuff happens. I still would highly recommend these curtains.",

                "reviewText": "* read update*These may not be the sturdiest of all the curtains, I already had a tiny bit of unraveling while I was adjusting the pins, but that's hidden, that's why I knocked one star. Only concern is how they'll last pulling them open and closed after a while. But for the price, they look gorgeous. Color is perfect, and they get the look of the Two Pages or any other pricey custom drapes for less than half the price. Love that they come two per package. I needed 4 panels and it was a fraction of the cost for the others I looked at even here on Amazon. Overall I'm very satisfied, these will at least last until I get bored with the style and I'll know I didn't invest way too much in them to change them out in a few years.3 month update: I loved these curtains so much I bought two more sets for my bedroom. These are definitely holding up to daily opening and closing, they hang so nicely, they filter the light nicely and provide adequate privacy. If you don't need custom sizes curtains, but want the luxe, custom linen look, don't hesitate to try these out. Returns/exchanges are so simple (I ordered the wrong size for the bedroom and got my refund right away to reorder) and the quality was just as good for the next sets as for the first. I may have been the problem with the first set, I actually figured out how to insert the pins without causing any unraveling, so for that I give them 5 stars.",

I bought from different expensive shops, but every time something did not workout either the fabric was off or the color was off.. not even considering the price. I tried cheaper ones from amazon but the fabric wasn't good, it looked cheap. And right when i gave up i saw some blogger posted a reference for these curtains saying they were from amazon, so i decided to give amazon another chance. Because the price is so inexpensive.And i'm happy above and beyond, i had to sew the tape myself bc i have a curtain rail, though they are ready to go if you have a rod. It looks very natural, expensive, just the look that i was going for, the fabric is flowy, not to mention it has little weights at the corner of each panel.it is still a little wrinkled on the picture as it is just our of the packaging.thank you. I would definetely recomend this and buy them again.",

                "reviewText": "These drapes are really nice and well made. I used two panels on each side of my standard size sliding door and they look full and all matched perfectly. They are sheer enough to let light through, but offer enough privacy to obfuscate the view. They are more of a beige color but have some white threads throughout. After studying many drapes I picket these and so happy I did!",
