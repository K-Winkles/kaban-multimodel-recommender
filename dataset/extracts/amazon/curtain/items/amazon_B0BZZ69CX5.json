The shading is entirely acceptable, ensuring they offer just the right balance between light filtering and privacy.The set includes two gold and white tasseled cords, adding a touch of sophistication. These cords can be used to tie back the entire panel or just the tulle, according to preference. Additionally, there are two elegant corded ties in a matching gold fabric. These details, coupled with the lovely rainbow of colors the curtains display, make them a stunning addition to any room.What's more, these curtains provide an opportunity to add a dash of magic to any room. Simply attach fairy lights to create a whimsical look that is sure to delight. They efficiently block out light and have become an adorable feature in my son's room.These curtains are especially striking during twilight hours, adding a serene and mystical atmosphere. They've made a perfect addition to our child's playroom. Their long, flowy design also works well in my daughter's room, adding a touch of elegance and charm. The adaptability of these curtains makes them a worthwhile purchase.",
