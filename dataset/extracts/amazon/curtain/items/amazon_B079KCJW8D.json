However, they fit my new sliding doors perfectly, and look fantastic. The price point is amazing. There is no sunlight coming through and hitting my walls - (they are not sheer) I bought them specifically, so I would not get sun damage on a painting. Note\u2026at the same time, they are not a \u201ccomplete\u201d blackout. I mention this, as some people need complete darkness to sleep, such as through the morning, or if they\u2019re night workers, etc. - if you need complete blackout these probably would not be the best for you. However, they\u2019re perfect for darkening enough for me, creating privacy and they are amazingly elegant, and have transformed my master into a beautiful, regal place. I hope this helps in making a choice.",

It\u2019s water resistant and stain resistant. It doesn\u2019t seem to catch pet hair. And it offers a lovely solution to an overly bright room, as well as offers a good amount of noise reduction. I use it as a curtain for a doorway, and I was able to use multiple curtains to create a very, pretty non-tacky doorway, and it really is effective in terms of blocking sounds from downstairs. It also completely blocks out the light. Oh, it also is light weight and, I have gotten so many sets of the specific curtain that I\u2019ve used them all over the house and I just think for the price and the beauty of this product I\u2019m going to be adding it to the downstairs",
