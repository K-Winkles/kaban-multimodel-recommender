                "reviewText": "Having recently started a new job working alternating shifts (and struggling to adjust to sleeping during daylight hours), I have purchased numerous sets of room-darkening and blackout panels in recent months. The SunZero Cooper Thermal panels have been among the best I\u2019ve tried, and are by far the prettiest - all at an excellent price point!These panels are constructed of a vibrant, heavyweight polyester, with a solid white reverse. These are a stiffer panel than many I\u2019ve tried, retaining their pleated shape after many weeks of hanging. While they are not true blackout panels - the sunlight streaming in does illuminate the panels, as shown in photos - they have done an excellent job reducing and filtering the light, and have better thermal/insulating properties than any other curtain panel we\u2019ve tried recently. We notice a definite reduction in drafts while these curtains are drawn shut.Regarding aesthetics, the botanical print on these curtain panels is stunning and vibrant. The neutral-colored floral pattern pops on the distressed navy blue background. The hardware is also thoughtfully chosen. The large, brushed silver grommets do not appear out of place, but complement the grays and tans of the print, while also allowing the panels to glide open and closed effortlessly.All in all, these have been my favorite of the several brands of room darkening panels I\u2019ve purchased in recent months. SunZero provides a fashionable solution for second- and third-shift workers who do not want to sacrifice style in exchange for quality sleep.",

                "reviewText": "Just what I wanted. The sheerness is not really sheer considering they are a black out curtain. But they aren\u2019t heavy and are just the right heaviness. They aren\u2019t \u201c luxurious\u201d ( meaning the fabric quality) because I don\u2019t live in a luxurious\u201d home. They are very pretty and a great value for the price. Someone mentioned in a previous review that they are \u201cstiff\u201d but I think they are a bit sturdy and I\u2019m very happy with them. They do keep out just the right amount of sun in our summer time afternoons which get very warm here and that\u2019s why I bought them. I ended up buying 4 panels for my average sliding glass door and 4 more for the other window on that wall. It\u2019s a very pretty design.",

I just opened to package to put them up for winter - I cannot even IMAGINE - ANY season or situation these would be appropriate for. Waaay to thin for winter. Synthetic material - with a synthetic backing. Doesn't look like they would survive ONE wash. Nasty, toxic look and feel to the fabric. Super-ugly colors! Yuck!! Wish I could return them. Literally THE WORST curtains I have ever seen!!!",

These showed up and I was so pleasantly surprised at the colours, the quality, and overall look of them. They look like they're embroidered from a distance, they're lined, and the don't look cheap at all. The picture that's provided on Amazon doesn't do them justice. if you're thinking about these ones, take a chance and order them as they're beautiful!!",
