I do have a window shade up but I wanted something on a tension rod to make it darker on days when you're not feeling the \"light\". That window gets the sunsets and it can be overwhelming. Well this plan worked out perfectly. It was like the curtain was made for this window. The material is thick, has a sheen to it. Nicely sown seems. Beautiful color! They're not 100% blackout, but they definitely block a ton of light! I'm satisfied. I ordered gray also for a backup incase I need to wash these and change them out.Oh and btw--they washed up great on gentle cycle, cold and I dried them in the dryer on gentile. Trust me, these are nice for the price!!",

All we had in our kitchen was some blinds and they were/are not energy efficient or thermal. While these are not lined they are pretty thick and the dark color blue I ordered is both room darkening and UV filtering. They fit over the blinds (which are indented into the window frames), and they look very nice in my kitchen.",

However, I don't dislike the color enough to return them, and in every other way they're exactly what I wanted. They are excellent for blocking out the sun, in a room where I don't want it. The material itself is attractive, looks pretty wrinkle resistant, and they did well in the laundry, no issues. Overall, happy with everything, just not the color.",

Simple solution was to not use the rod pocket, but a use the rod with rings and alligator clips (clip rings) - this added @ 3\" to the length of the curtains. The curtains hang very nicely and look great closed or pushed to the side. I'd definitely buy more of this same style for other windows wen the time comes.",
