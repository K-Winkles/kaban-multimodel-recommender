                "reviewText": "Purchased: 100x96 / Color: Naturallocally it was impossible to find curtains which were large enough for our 8ft french doors, these were such a great option. Great quality curtain at a reasonable price.Although the vendor offers many fashionable color choices.... we needed a very neutral color to blend in with existing items. The \"natural\" color is very similar to a pair of traditional summer linen pants.. the fabric has some texture to it and is NOT shiny at all like many options out there. (blackout liner is creamy off-white- not black)The curtains offer complete privacy when closed - I would say they are medium weight curtains. Not heavy duty/heavy weight curtains to offer extreme temperature insulation... however; for our climate they are more than adequate to knock the chill off the patio doors and block any drafts.As you might imagine they are wrinkled out of the package. We let them hang for a week to ensure we were happy with the purchase of all items (curtains & rods) Using a heavy duty fabric steamer reduced the wrinkles ...... but to make them fully seamless be prepared to iron or take to dry cleaner to have them pressed. I would not hesitate to reorder these curtains.",

The backing has a lining that is plastic-like, I would be very careful actually ironing it. Over all, very pleased and the curtain blocks out most of the light and heat without being totally black.",

                "reviewText": "We have lives in our house for 6.5 years and I still hadn\u2019t changed the curtains in our living room from the previous owner! I just couldn\u2019t figure out what color I wanted in order to go with the furniture. I have tan walls and chocolate brown furniture and cherry tables. I wanted something lighter since everything else is so dark. It had to be black out, but I didn\u2019t want something with a pattern/design but I wanted a material with a little texture, like a linen. Our living room window is also a huge picture window so I had a hard time finding panels big enough to cover it without having to buy 3/4 panels. I ordered three different set of drapes because I couldn\u2019t decide. These were the third set I ordered and I love them. They are big enough to cover my window with only two panels and still have some wave to them to look like curtains (the other pair I bought looked like a giant sheet over the window like a college dorm). These definitely are black out and I love that, my living room is so dark at night! The only downside to these is that the lining on the back side sounds like a plastic mattress cover when you open and close them. I don\u2019t mind that much as I open them in the morning and close them in the evening so i don\u2019t have to hear it all day long. I also bought some really pretty linen sheets to go behind them. They look great together. I recommend these curtains for sure!",

They are substantial in weight and have a nice neutral look...The natural color was a great choice for my living room.I replaced two panels that I had purchased through a major retailer which were smaller lighter and definitely not blackout as they had been advertised...The Amazon (chinese) supplier was better for sure.The drapes came folded but showed no major wrinkles or lines and I was able to hang them with no ironing.It is hard to even find extra wide panels and when you do they are double the Amazon price.Recommend them highly.",

It was very wrinkly from the package and needs to be steamed.",
