                "reviewText": "It was pretty hard to find curtains that were not solid. They do keep out the bright sunlight of the afternoon sun, and while not completely blackout, they are enough for a living room. I would not be happy with these in my bedroom for darkness. Simply took them out and hung them up, and they looked fine. The patterns match on each pair, but not to other pairs, and since I used 5 pairs in the living room, I had to be careful how I put them up. Still they are not so far off that most people will notice. Wrinkles fell out. The material is silky and nice. I think they are working out nicely and look good with the neutral greige paint.",
