                "reviewText": "TLDR; These are great and dark! Approved!I had to write a review partly because of how long I spent reading/comparing reviews on every affordable \u201cblack out curtain\u201d on Amazon that I could find and felt like a review like mine woulda sold me on these sooner.Firstly- they\u2019re great and I am happy with my purchase and definitely recommend these!I just moved into a place where the sun rises right in my window and there are days I don\u2019t wanna be up at 6am. I already have slatted window blinds, but those are generally useless for light filtration. These are not necessarily BLACK OUT curtains. If you are looking for a 3rd shift sleeper or nursery, these MIGHT not be dark enough for you.**However**!! Having tried to sleep with the blinds not doing anything and then these? It\u2019s literally night and day difference. They were PLENTY dark enough to aid my sleeping in, and I\u2019m a very light sleeper. So while they aren\u2019t technically BLACK OUT- they are ABSOLUTELY darkening enough to sleep with. I am picky and pleased.Secondly, as you can see, the landlord unfortunately have the apartment walls painted a cream color - that just so happens to match my bed frame exactly lol. With warm lighting on top of that, I really wanted a color that would crisp and cool the space down from its warmness. Choosing the right blue took a while as most blue curtains offered are a greyish/muted color or a dark blue, or an aqua/greenish tinted blue - all of which would make the room look dingy. This blue color is really nice, light and airy but still modest.Thirdly, they came wrinkled, as to be expected with packaging. So expect to iron or steam before hanging, but don\u2019t set your iron too hot. I used a small iron and it didn\u2019t do great, I wish I had a steamer.Lastly- In the photos, with the curtains closed, it seems like there is a lot of light coming thru and that deterred me in seeing this in others photos. Tried to show the difference with them drawn, but really assuring you, it\u2019s not too bright!",

                "reviewText": "These curtains arrived within four days of my order, and were nicely folded in a clear plastic pouch. They were exactly as advertised by the seller, and the color was was spot-on (I bought royal blue and black).These curtains really work! Why they aren't more widely available, is a total mystery to me.The older I get, the more easily my sleep is disturbed by things like light and sound. I had a thick, ugly pair of rubber-backed thermal curtains that just disgusted me (and they blocked very little light). I thought there was no way these thin curtains could do any better, but I was wrong!I wanted something attractive, but live on disability and needed something that was inexpensive. I bought these for their looks and value, and to cover an unwanted pair of Venetian blinds my apartment had installed. Royal blue does not block 100% of all light, but comes darn close and black DOES. I have strong morning exposure on my bedroom window, and the black curtains blocked it all! I loved these so much, I turned around and ordered a second pair and hung them behind on a double rod. Now the only light coming from my window is around the edges (and I've dealt with most of that).These are very light in weight (compared to traditional fabrics), but do a fantastic job of blocking light. I'm hanging 4 pairs from a double rod, and they're almost half the weight of the woven pair they replaced! They have a nice satiny sheen to them that looks rich and enhances the colors beautifully. They do have some thermal blocking quality, but you'll need something extra if you're having a serious problem with hot/cold temps.The big surprise (as if I wasn't pleased enough), was the added sound blocking quality. There are a lot of children who play right outside my window. Naturally, they're an earful. These curtains have significantly lowered the amount of sound that reaches my ears. I had no idea how much noise was coming straight through the window panes until I got these curtains!These are simple but beautiful curtains that do what they say they do! And I consider them great quality for the price. I have bought four sets, and will be buying more for my living room.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: I originally gave these a 5-star because they are really really nice curtains. However, after getting them all hung up, 1 panel is a full 1\" shorter than all the rest. I really needed a 46\" length, but the 45\" was doable without much notice. And most curtains on the market don't come in 46\" lengths. So, I emprovised to make the 45\" work. After hanging them up, 1 panel out of a 2-panel pack was a full inch shorter making the 2 inch difference definately noticable. Since they only come in 2-panel packs, it's difficult to complain/return and request a panel replacement. It looks funny but will have to make do. Just wanted to bring that issue to attention for both quality control and buyers.I did not expect the quality to be as good as it is. I replaced blinds with these curtains to better block out direct sun in Summer and cold in Winter. It's clearly dual function. Further, much easier to remove and wash than it is to wipe down blinds. It came in a set of 2 panels, but I used each panel for a different window on tension rods. Total WIN-WIN for me with the affordability, quality, 2 window coverage per set, blackout and room temperature control. Nice smooth shein but certainly not overbearing.",
