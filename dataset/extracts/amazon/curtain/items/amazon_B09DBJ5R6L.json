                "reviewText": "Wow. I was pleasantly surprised with these drapes of excellent quality and were also so easy on the budget! The material is soft and was a bit creased in the package. I simply put each pair in the dryer with a damp cloth for about 10 minutes. Most of the creases were gone and the remaining few disappeared after hanging overnight. They truly are room.darkening. I have a huge front window and these drapes make the room quite dark, requiring a lamp to see! I don\u2019t believe I could have made a better choice! To clarify a description I questioned, each panel is 54 inches across, not the pair of panels enclosed. The 2 panels cover 108 inches if stretched flat, although you need to leave a few pleats for the appearance sake. I can\u2019t imagine anyone would not be happy with these.",
