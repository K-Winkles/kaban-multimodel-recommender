                "reviewText": "I rarely write reviews but it took me three different attempts to find the *right* sheer curtains for my living room. I wanted something that would not only let light in, but that I could still actually see through and enjoy watching the birds and squirrels from inside. I tried a couple other brands that actually were *too* opaque and *too* thick for what I needed. They left me with plenty of privacy but felt very heavy in the space. These are GREAT! They provide enough privacy that I'm not worried about people seeing into my living room when walking by, have a nice texture and weight to them so they don't feel cheap, AND they are still actually sheer enough that they let in plenty of light and enough transparency for me to still enjoy the outdoors. AND they have both back tabs and rod pocket to provide a couple different hanging options. Would definitely recommend for those looking for not-cheap, light weight, light-filtering, privacy providing curtain for their space.",

I\u2019m so glad I found these NICETOWN curtains on Amazon. They sell them in packs of 2 panels which is convenient. To add on that, I feel the quality of the fabric on these sheer curtains are the best! The ones I\u2019ve looked at in the store were so thin and felt like they would tear soon. I think these curtains do a great job of being sheer but also durable.",

Unfortunately I should have ordered the 96\" inch. These are 84\". So I will be returning them and purchasing the longer size if available. I was able to use the regular curtain hooks but you can hang them on a curtain rod as well. Good find. Good price.",
