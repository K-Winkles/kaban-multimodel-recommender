                "reviewText": "Put these drapes in the Fantastic Amazon Find category!! Each panel is 70 inches wide by 84 inches long. The package includes 2 panels for the really fantastic price of about 25 dollars. This should be the \"new normal\" for curtain panels. The fuller the better is my opinion. I was getting by with 2 of the standard 54 inch panels on my 60 inch picture window. They were fine for when they were open, but when they were closed, the draping was uneven and the sides or center lacked coverage. I just hate when the sheers beneath stick out the sides. So sometimes I added another set of 2 panels for 4 in total, to get a fuller look and even coverage when closed. But the seams and separations in a 4 panel window treatment was so annoying. These are perfect. Please note that they do not include any tie-backs like many panel sets do. There were the usual packaging creases and wrinkles, but I have a clothing steamer and that did the trick. I was advised by a drycleaner not to wash packaged drapes before hanging because manufacturers treat the fabric with an anti-wrinkle agent. If that gets washed out before all the wrinkles are removed, you may never get all the wrinkles out. I hung them right out of the package and ran the steamer over all those creases. They look crisp, hang nicely, and are even across the bottom, sides and top. I ordered the green color which is not quite as bright as pictured. I was actually hoping the green would be even brighter, but they still look great with our abstract-patterned carpeting. The shade of this green color will also work year-round, which is a bonus because I am so sick of the seasonal drape decisions, purchases, and window work. Also of note, these drapes are really, really good at room darkening. The fabric is very thick and opaque. This may not be what you want in the summer months, depending on placement and lifestyle. We have had many sets of curtains and drapes in this fabric. It is also very insulating in the winter. It has been a godsend for our drafty doorwall. I would actually like more light let in, but the tradeoff would be the nosey neighbors getting an eyefull of what really goes on over here. Sorry I didn't post a picture, but I am waiting on magnetic curtain tie-backs. Right now I'm using mismatched old neckties and I don't really want to put that out there in perpetuity.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love these curtains!!! I wouldn\u2019t completely call them darkening curtains, but that\u2019s mainly because I think I got a very light colored one. My son has some navy colored ones and hardly any light passes through them. These however, \u201clight up\u201d when the sun hits them. My living room does seem to block out a lot more sunlight than my previous curtains, but again, if you\u2019re looking for curtains that don\u2019t pass any light, perhaps get a dark color. These curtains are the same color on both sides which I love. Some curtains have a dark grey on one side to block out the sun, but I\u2019m not a fan of that.Now, something I have learned about these curtains is that if you want to completely darken the room you\u2019re going to have to do more than just install curtains. To get my sons room to be completely dark, I had to get the curtain rods that curve in. I also doubled up on curtains. By this I mean I installed the room darkening curtains about 5 inches higher than the window and installed less expensive curtains right at the window. Using the inexpensive curtain rods with the inexpensive curtains, I added a color matching towel in between the wall and inexpensive curtain rod. At first I thought it would look weird but because the inexpensive curtains had some material on the top, it actually hid the towel pretty well. This prevented any sunlight from coming through on the top part. So when I closed the darkening curtains it was truly completely dark. I mainly did this because my son would not nap unless it was actually completely dark. I also found that this helped me whenever I got migraines and needed a place that was dark. I also got the curtains a little longer so they fall a little on the floor. By doing these extra steps I found that the room became extremely dark and kept the room cooler during summer months. You obviously don\u2019t have to do this but if you\u2019re looking to completely darken a room, those extra steps helped achieve that.These are really beautiful curtains. They are a heavy and sturdy material. When I took them out of the package the creases were very apparent so I ironed them out. I ironed on the side that faces out in low heat and it did pretty well. I haven\u2019t washed them so not sure how they hold up in the washer. When I did take them out of the package they had a minor plastic smell to them, but I sprayed them lightly with a fabric spray and that smell went away in a couple days. I do recommend these curtains to anyone looking for nice, durable curtains. I have not had an issue with them whatsoever.",

Still using it after 2 years in the master bedroom and is happy with the color, material and quality but I wouldn\u2019t use it in my baby\u2019s room.The product description says \u201c85 to 99% impeding of light\u201d and I would say it\u2019s on the lower end, maybe 70- 85%It\u2019s still a great curtain for at night - it at least blocks street lights. But for the afternoon with full sunshine, it is still pretty bright in the room\u2014 It darkened the room enough that it is better than window blinds without curtains (just not truly blackout which is why I wouldn\u2019t put in a baby\u2019s room)",
