                "reviewText": "Absolutely gorgeous color & it was shockingly true to the color in the image, which is a miracle in itself! I purchased the dark teal, i had bought another on Amazon that said it was dark teal and it was a DULL looking NAVY. returned that and tried this one... PERFECTO!I Needed a curtain for my sliding glass door in the dining room asap, something very functional but that would suit a dining room area. These fit the bill give complete privacy when drawn and i noticed keep heat out in the evening when the sun glares from that side of my house! I bought only one at first, but it just barely covered the entire slider which didnt look great, so I bought another one. DEFINITELY buy two If you need curtains for that application! Two of these panels give exactly the right amount of fabric, drape nicely hang easily look absolutely PERFECT open or closed. (my sliding glass door is standard size)The fabric is LOVELY, has a nice sheen, catches the light from my grandmothers crystal chandelier at night slightly, which gives a nice feel to my room. AS A BONUS... they ARE just throw in washing machine and hang right back up to dry! (also SOLVES THE WRINKLES ISSUE!) - my Great Dane 120LB PUPPY stepping & slobbering on the panel hung on the opening door side, therefore having to wash that one panel, I can tell you the color STAYED true.Wow that makes life easy! (I washed in cold water on gentle)Those of you with pets or even kids may find my solution to that situation helpful, I found a sphere traverse rod on Amazon, which has clips and can now pullbentire curtain to the non opening side.. Surprisingly they still look good even though they have grommets, and my doggie footprint and slobber problem was solved.All in all I am VERY happy with these panels and may purchase a set for my 12 foot living room window!4 STAR rating is only for two things, i noticed bottom hem is NOT 100% straight on both my panels... For this price they SHOULD be. OTHER THAN THAT.. EXCELLENT!",
