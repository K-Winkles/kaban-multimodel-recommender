                "reviewText": "First off I cannot believe the number of people complaining about the price...$66.00 for two insulated panels is a bargain. Second, the complaints regarding the number of panels in one package, um it clearly states in the heading of listing that it is indeed ONE panel, not two. As an online business owner all I can say is people need to read what the heading of listing states. Lastly as much as we love these in my den, a bit disappointed that you CANNOT IRON as per the cleaning intruction labels. The insulated backing is a rubber type material hence the no iron on tag. Could melt possibly even with a towel? All in all again we love them!",

                "reviewText": "These are 100% blackout curtains -- zero light comes through -- except for the side hems and bottom hem. The fabric is moderately heavy and smooth, hangs nicely, and does not look cheap. No funny smells. The color and metallic design are exactly as on my screen. I washed & dried them with no problem. Here's how I did it: washed on gentle cycle using cold water and a detergent with no additives whatsoever (also no fabric softener), and then dried on low heat with no cool-down (and no dryer sheet). You have to move them from the warm drier to hanging immediately and without bunching them up, or you get wrinkles. If you want to hang two or more panels side-by-side, as I did, you may need to order several to find a set in which the gold design matches well enough (as in the stock photo on the product page). I had to order 12 panels to get 3 that looked okay side-by-side. The placement of the metallic design varies considerably! Also, on 1 of the panels the color of the top stitching was different (a darker thread color). Still, I really like these and I'm glad ordered & returned enough to get a set.",

I would highly recommend. The ONLY con is that it did not come in lengths longer than 84\". I wish it was made in 96\" length as I would have given 5 star for the review for sure. Buy this! I've received MANY compliments as I use 2 panels as my inner \"showpiece\" on my window with 2 light grey faux silk blackout panels on either side. Many people love the look...very chic.
