I would not call them room darkening, because you can see light from the window behind them, but they would block the sun. They are good privacy curtains.

To start with the \"negative\", they do not have a white background, rather, it is ivory, which is what I wanted. They are also not light blocking...don't know why all these Lush brand curtains are advertised that way...but no matter. The workmanship on them was good. The fabric is polyester, but it looks very rich. I do hang my curtains double width for a more elegant look, so each window has 2 sets of curtains. Very happy with this product.",
