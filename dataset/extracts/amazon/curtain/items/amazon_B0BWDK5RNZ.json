I bought the gray and purple and the grey and black. They appear to be well made and sturdy. I'm very happy and will be ordering one more set for my second bedroom soon.",

                "reviewText": "The curtains are nice but I only gave them 4 stars because of the white stripe. Here is what I like and what I don't care for.Pros: The curtains block light. I have them hanging in front of 3 large windows and the curtains do block out the light. I like that the wrinkles were fairly easy to remove. I like the design, subtle, yet enough to break up the solid coloring. The gradient coloring is nice except (here is what I don't like).Cons: There is an 11\" inch wide WHITE stripe on the end of the curtain. There is no design, just white fabric. Even if the design would have been continued throughout the white, it would have looked better. When the curtains are fully drawn, the white stripe looks out of place. Recommendation, either continue the design so the white is tied into the rest of the curtain or make the white stripe less than 11\" wide. I only fully draw the curtains at night, so I'm keeping the curtains. However this is the reason for the 4 stars and decreasing the desirability of value for the money. I have a total of 4 curtains hanging in the living room and when fully drawn, the white stands out and looks odd.",
