You cannot see through the curtains very well but they are a little see-through. I can see sunlight and some images outside but they are not a blackout solution if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. But they definitely cover enough where you wouldn\u2019t feel like people can see in Inside your house especially from the street or far away. Very easy simple solution and 100% would recommend this to anybody. It was very easy install as I said on the video maybe five minutes for both total.",
