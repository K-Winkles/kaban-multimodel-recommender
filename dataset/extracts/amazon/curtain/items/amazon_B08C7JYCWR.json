The material is very nice to the touch and made well. The rings are great because you have options of what kind of rod you want to hang them on. They never look dusty or dirty so they seem to repel dust a bit. Super affordable and because they are made up of so much material you can even use one set for 2 smaller windows if you don\u2019t need a really luxe curtain look. In some rooms you want that and in other rooms it\u2019s not necessary and they still look nice. All in all; I hope these stay this high quality and affordable because we will likely buy these over and over again throughout the years when needed. \ud83d\ude0e",

Can\u2019t beat getting two as well since most sell them individually which gets pricey. Definitely buy these and they come in so many colors, they keep the cold air out and your room will be dark like a cave!",

                "reviewText": "I read the reviews and hoped they'd be as described. Image one, old curtains (Ikea) at approximately 9 am in an east-facing room, image two these Amazon Deconovo blackout curtains in a dark room at approximately 9:05 am. Image three, later in the afternoon with the other window open so you can see the color and the wrinkles. They're nice and bright white, kind of a slight sheen, smooth fabric, kind of polyester-ish. They're fine. I would buy again if I wanted true blackout curtains. As far as wrinkling, I know I could have steamed or ironed them before hanging but I did not. Don't care that much about something temporary like fold-marks. I mean, they have to fold them to ship, so what do you expect? I hope these images help somebody else debating whether they'll block light.",
