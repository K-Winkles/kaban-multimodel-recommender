                "reviewText": "These are absolutely the next best option to custom made and measured drapes. Hands down. If you aren\u2019t considering custom measured and designed drapes - stop searching, pick a color, and order these.These are thick, totally blackout, soft, and have none of the gross vinyl blackout liner on the window-facing side. Truly a differentiated level of thickness and quality.Of course they are wrinkled out of the packaging. You buy a $40 handheld steamer and it takes about 30 minutes to perfect 15 panels - I timed it. Looks beautiful. Could not be easier.Bottom line is I\u2019ve had $50k of curtains before, and this cost me less than $1000, including hardware, with a mixture of 108\u201d, 96\u201d, and 84\u201d long curtains throughout the house - and neither my wife nor kids nor friends can tell the difference. Great product.",

I understand that train noise is not easy to block away.The light blocking is very good, My room used to be very bright at night thanks to the street lights, this curtain surely does not let the light go through. However, to completely black out a room, you need to make suer it covers the whole window and seal all the possible gaps. Mine is simply hanged on the blinds and there is a 2 inch on top of my curtain. So my room is still pertty bright at morning when the curtail is closed.The curtain itself is solid and is not too heavy, I hope it last long.",

                "reviewText": "These curtains are fantastic they feel thick, heavy and sturdy. The holes all align perfectly with the same space between all of them making them be extremely symmetrical. The only flaw I see is that the wrinkles that they come with are VERY deep and even after ironing them twice and washing I could not get them all out so I highly recommend ironing them and then spraying them with water for a day or two so that they can dewrinkle themselves. After doing that they look utterly delightful and make any small room look so much bigger and brighter without having light come in which is a must have in a desert community. So far my living has felt cooler and these are 100 percent black out curtains. Beware that the off white is still a very bright white but it didn't bother me too much as my lighting is a soft golden setting so they matched it well. Overall if your going to buy curtains buy these !",
