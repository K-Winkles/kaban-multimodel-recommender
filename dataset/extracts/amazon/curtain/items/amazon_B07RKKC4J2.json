                "reviewText": "I love these curtains! I was disappointed in my first try with another brand, also on Amazon. The product description on my return stated that they were linen in one place and polyester in another place. Amazon was great about making the return quick & painless- thanks Amazon! I wasn't looking for plastic curtains, I wanted a natural fiber.I agonized about trying again with this product from H. Versailtex. The product description did not give the fabric content- but I finally went ahead and decided to give them a try. Sure glad I did! For those of you that want the fabric content, the label says they are 70% linen and 30% polyester. Yay! There's just enough polyester to help with winkles and the ability to wash.They are light and airy and feel like you would expect a natural fabric to look and feel like. They are sheer but still have the ability to filter some light. I was pleased with the color- \"Castle Wall\" which has a nice warm but natural feel to it. The size is good I ordered 52\" X 72\" which is longer than strictly necessary allowing for shrinkage.I gave it 5 stars for \"wrinkle free\" because it's really an unfair question. You have to expect some wrinkling with linen. I did iron before hanging and they are gorgeous! Really happy!",

So I did return them as I wanted more privacy than they give. The quality is nice, but they are more sheer than advertised.",

They hide the ugly blue tiles behind it, and with an opaque liner it\u2019s not shear at all and nothing can be seen through it. On their own they are semi shear, I imagine in front of a window they wouldn\u2019t block too much light.The texture is great too, and the colour is warm without being too yellow/ cream.I highly recommend and I will be purchasing more in the future.",
