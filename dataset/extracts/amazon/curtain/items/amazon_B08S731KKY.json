                "reviewText": "We have an eastern view from our bedroom window, and my wife (aka \"the BOSS\") always had trouble sleeping in the morning because the sun would wake her up early. I tried everything to make our room darker, but nothing seemed to work. Then, she insisted we try these these blackout drapes from Amazon, and I'm so glad I did!These are amazing! They completely block out the light, even in the middle of the day. Now, I she finally sleep in peace without being woken up by the sun.I'm also very impressed with the quality of these drapes. They are made of a thick, durable material that feels like it will last for years. They were also incredibly easy to install.Overall, she's extremely happy with these blackout blinds, and that's all that really matters. They are a great value for the money, and they have made my life so much better. I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to make their room darker for sleeping or any other reason ;)",

                "reviewText": "I love how soft yet heavy the fabric is. My curtains are right above a couple of vents and my previous curtains used to flutter and puff up with their coming out of the vents. Not these curtains. They are heavy enough that they don't move and the air goes where it's supposed to without disturbing the curtains. They are also blackout curtains, so I can definitely tell that they do a great job keeping the heat out in summer. Maybe even street noise has gotten less prominent.I would buy these again. White looks very nice btw. Makes my room look larger and more elegant.Used a steamer after I hung them to get the wrinkles out.",

They truly allow zero light in without looking bulky or tacky. The white adds elegance to our room and helps provide a calm space to relax. They also help keep the heat/cold out of our home by acting as insulation. Would definitely buy again.",
