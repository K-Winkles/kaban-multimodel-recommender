                "reviewText": "I purchsed these curtains because I wanted to update the look of my room without a hefty price tag. They are nice curtains. The material is a waffle type weave and gives a nice texture. They are not completely sheer. I like that they let light shine through while providing some privacy. As with any folded material, I did have to iron them before I hung them because they were wrinkled. The grommets are a brushed bronze color. The seams are nice and finished looking. They were one or two stray strings I had to trim, but nothing excessive. Overall, the are semi sheer panels that hang well. I ordered 6 panels and they were all the same length and quality. I think they look more expensive than what I paid. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a less expensive curtain.",

                "reviewText": "I have a special use for this and it will probably take a lot of words to explain, so please read on... I'll probably say some things you'll care about. I bought 18 panels!I am upgrading a guest room and adding a room divider to give guests a place not so visible when the double doors to the kitchen are opened. I doubt anyone would do that, of course, but guests would worry about it anyway. This room has 3 windows and the room divider is also made of curtains, weighted at the bottom to make them stable and to hold the shape better. I wanted something NOT see through, but that could pass light. I ordered these mainly because they are inexpensive, but also there were many reviews that gave me confidence.Suggestion: Check out YouTube's videos on hanging grommet curtains... they will give you the basics.1. These are extra wide panels and only have 6 grommets. To look as good as they can look, you'll need a curtain rod that can be adjusted far out from the wall. I had to modify my mounting of the rods to give them enough distance out from the window, etc. to hang properly. If you don't understand what I mean, please ask a question in the comments below and I'll answer.2. They do allow light passage, but NOT vision. I held it up to the window to check that and I can see nothing through it. Some reviews said they are thin, well that's not correct. They may be light weight and they do not have linings or sprayed foam on the back, but you definitely can't see through. This was particularly important where my room divider goes right next to a glass-walled shower. If I had see-through curtains, It would not hide anyone taking a shower, right? I'm concerned enough to carefully scrutinize these curtains.3. They are well stitched and washable. Children stay in that room sometimes and grubby fingers will find a way of touching anything white. I'll report on washability as an update later.4. See through is not a problem on the windows because there are Venitian blinds, but I do want light passage with the blinds open. The thickness of this panel is not too thin or too thick, but just right for that requirement.5. The situation requires the curtains to allow air to circulate, the heat or A/C to control the temperature and a little air movement to keep it from becoming too stale smelling during periods of vacancy.6. These curtains definitely need a good careful ironing to look good. They are heavily creased from folding and the nice zipper bags they each come in. If you don't know how to iron, get someone to help you that does know. Most of the photos here show that they didn't bother to iron. Fine if that's what you want.7. After buying 18, there IS some variation in lengths. This could be an issue if you only order two and find them drastically different. I was able with the large number to be able to match up lengths without trouble. You can also strategically hide a mismatch behind furniture in some cases if you can't work it out otherwise. I don't know if this is also a problem with higher priced curtains. There is certainly no way the retailer could check the exact matched length without taking them out of the packaging and then trying to fold them back exactly the same way, which was kind of complicated. No problem for me though because I just put the shorter curtains on one window and made sure the 11 that went onto the room divider were all perfectly matched.8. I weighted the bottom hems of the curtains on the room divider to keep them hanging nicely. I used 1oz fishing weights on each of the outward folds to do this and it works nicely to help space out the folds.Last comments: Plan out how your curtains will look open or closed, because you can't move a grommeted eyelet past the braces on your curtain rod. If you will only open the center, there's not a problem but if you want to open it wide and there are support hooks in the way, you'll need to get a ladder and lift the rod to do that... not cool. I'm talking about extra wide windows, of course.Adios and good luck!",

                "reviewText": "The following comes from my review of this company\u2019s matching yellow valance curtains that I bought at the same time and generally applies to these full curtains as well:(1) some reviewers commented that they received valance curtains of differing lengths. We bought four of these and when laid right next to each other on a table, they were not exact matched to each other, but the difference is not noticeable when they are hung. If this is typical, then it shouldn\u2019t be a problem, but most manufacturing yields some variance. If that were the case, I\u2019d exchange them at least once before returning. Based on our experience, I\u2019d say these are worth the small gamble.(2) The one thing I really wish were different is the fact that these valance curtains use a silver fitting for the curtain rod wholes \u2014 yet, the matching yellow (long) curtain that they sell uses brass colored fittings. Thus, they don\u2019t match. FYI, if you\u2019re buying both.Also, the fitting wholes are 5/8\u201d on the valance, whereas the fitting wholes on the full curtain are 1\u201d. So, don\u2019t get all 1\u201d rods thinking you can use the same exact rods for both (unless you go with all 5/8\u201d).(3) The fabric of the valances and full curtain was the exact same and same color yellow. Perfect!(4) As shown in some photos, but not all, the top and bottom of the valance doubles up the fabric. As a result, the valances are an orange-yellow on the top and bottom and yellow in between. The photos I saw didn\u2019t all show this consistently, so I wasn\u2019t sure. Now I know. That\u2019s what it tis.",

Plus I was in a bit of time-crunch. So I wound up paying a local alterations shop to hem them for me and she charged me $10 per pair to hem them all the same length - so they all matched the shortest one. (And I first she was trying to charge me $10 per panel. When refused and told her what I paid for each panel, she relented and lowered the alteration price) I was beyond annoyed.So I still urge folks to buy them - don't wait to until the last minute like me - and perhaps be prepared to buy a few more than you need so that you can get the enough panels with the same hem length.",
