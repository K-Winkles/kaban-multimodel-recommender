I only wish they were a little lighter in color but they still work in my livingroom. I did notice that one panel is slightly longer than the others. I love them so much that I ordered 2 more sets to get a fuller affect. Hoping they wash well too. I am amazed at the quality, beauty, and reasonably priced curtains that Amazon has in stock. This is my second time buying curtains from Amazon and have been very pleased! These curtains will remain in my livingroom for all seasons.",

Overall, I would recommend the product because the curtains are great. However, someone really should do better quality control to prevent visibly used items from being sold as new.",
