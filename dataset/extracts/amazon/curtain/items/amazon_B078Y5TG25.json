I washed them on delicate (cold water) and added liquid downy to the wash, dried them on high for long enough to get the wrinkles and fold lines out and immediately (and carefully) hung them still slightly damp to keep them from wrinkling again. Even though there are a few wrinkles still, they should hang out straight since they were slightly damp when hung.They are exactly what I was looking for! Washed up so nicely too! The price is definitely right! Great farmhouse look that complimented the wooden hanger with hooks my husband made for hanging them!(I used a thumbtack to attach the \u201cknot\u201d tie back to the wall and the outside edge of the curtain is also thumbtacked to keep it in place! Love the look)!",

I got them there on 4/9 and quickly found they were too white (my mistake, not seller's) for the room, and immediately ordered the eggshell color. I didn't see that my return window closed on that same day, and hope the seller reaches out to me so I might be able to return them, since I reordered the correct color (the Amazon \"contact us\" page doesn't work, so I'm attempting to contact seller this way). Either way, these are an excellent value and are very pretty and flowing!",
