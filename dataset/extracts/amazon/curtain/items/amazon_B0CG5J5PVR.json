                "reviewText": "Much better than I expected. From the photos, I thought these were satin. They're more like the fabric you get at school for a choir dress, or maybe a bridesmaid dress. Hard to explain but definitely not Shiney satin like I expected, thank goodness. These were the best option for the color I was searching for and they're perfect. Not like a deep emerald green but like a forest green with a touch of moss. Warmer toned than emerald. Very pretty. I was kind of stressed about how poorly the reviews showed the color, thought for sure I could do it better but this color is difficult to photograph! I don't know why it's showing so dark. Took a pic with daylight shining through and one with the overhead light on. I'll retry in the morning when the sun is on the other side (: It's lovely and I'm very happy with it. Excited to finish the window treatments with some longer shears and a second rod (: definitely blackout. Love that it's the same on both sides so I can tie them back or together or whatever I feel like doing and won't have to deal with hiding the ugly side.One thing I don't love is that the edges don't have an end tab. Idk if that's how all curtains just are, but it makes the ends flare out and the white strip up top is visible. I figured out how to tuck them into the bracket a bit to keep them down but I wish there was another loop to keep them that way.",
