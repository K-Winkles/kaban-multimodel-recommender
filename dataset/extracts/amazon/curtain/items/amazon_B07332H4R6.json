I purchased 12 panels for both a 72 inch window and a set if glass doors. Don't hesitate ...get them!!!",

Only reason for 4 stars is the price - $21 per panel seems high to me for sheer",

I am not sure if an older description didn't make that clear, and no idea why people in the answer section are saying there are two panels per pack - it is only one panel. Also people seem to be mentioning these are costly - I looked through literally thousands of curtain listings on Amazon and other online stores and physical stores and the price for this quality is good. I find these are high quality. They are beautiful and the sheer fabric is so much nicer than any other sheers I've seen in store. Looks almost like the fabric my wedding veil was made out of! They hang nicely and the pleats from being folded in the package are mostly gone after hanging a few weeks. You definitely can't iron these - they'd disintegrate. I really find these sheers stunning and they gave me exactly the look I wanted for my room.",
