In fairness, I didn\u2019t do my due diligence when buying them by reading the entire description, I just bought them do to the ratings and the title.My 4 requirements when shopping for these curtains were size, grommet top, blackout, and thermal insulation. Like I said before, I didn\u2019t do my due diligence and upon seeing that these curtains weren\u2019t blackout, I discovered that they do specify deep in the description that they block only 80% of light. Still, when I read, \u201cblackout\u201d I expect it to block out 100% of the light. I would have uploaded a picture but I kept getting an error.Secondly, this is a single layer of material, if you\u2019re looking for that double layered thermal insulation, you won\u2019t get it here. I can\u2019t imagine you get any thermal insulation while it\u2019s still allowing 20% of light to get through.I\u2019m disappointed in these, but you get what you pay for. Again, I\u2019m being honest, and to be fair these curtains DO darken the room quite a bit. They also do look nice and sleek, but just know what you\u2019re getting so you\u2019re not fooled by the title and ratings like I was.",

This also must hinder their light blocking because the do still let some light in. That's why the 4 stars - advertised as black out and are not. I would call them room darkening. They certainly do a good job at that!These pictures are strait out of the box and hung up. Not at all concerned about wrinkles, I'm sure that they will work themselves out. Very pleased with the purchase for the price and would definitely buy more and/or recommend to a friend. Absolutely no regrets. But if you are looking for total black outs, these are not for you.",

I want to wake up naturally and not be rudely awakened by the nasty ol' sun peaking in my window. Luckily my window is small and these cover it beautifully. These curtains are NOT sheer. They are intended to be black-out curtains that block light.",
