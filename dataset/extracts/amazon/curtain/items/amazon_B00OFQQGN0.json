Quality is super good for the price, takes about 2-3 years to burnout in the sun if you have a house with a lot of sunlight (like us), then again I switch them out every 3-4 months. Definitely worth every penny. Plus they are blackout type of curtains (heavy silky material), our windows are too big and that was not the purpose for them, overall highly recommend. I have been rebuying in different colors for different seasons, like I have them in orange for the fall, red for Christmas, white for spring which iam currently ordering yellow to switch it up next year. Quality and price is great so def recommend",
