How to install these curtains? These curtains are installed by screwing curtain rod holders onto your wall, then set the curtain rod onto the holder, and slide the large grommets in the curtains over the rod. Very simple. The rods are purchased separately. What material are these made of exactly? natural or synthetic? These curtains are made of faux linen textured. Why is the color of the curtains I received a little different from when I browsed? Hi, there is a slight difference in the color of the curtains due to different display devices or lighting problems. Does this item come with a curtain rod or ring clips? No, without curtain rod or ring clips.",

                "reviewText": "I lost count of how many sets I ordered for our open-concept downstairs--I think 13 sets! Though not blackout, these curtains do offer privacy--on my larger windows, I have two sets per window, which helps--and they are affordable enough to double up. Standing outside at night trying to look in, you can see the glow of lights and movement if people are walking around, but not details. They hang beautifully and look expensive and high-end; we have also appreciated how they help to regulate the temperature in the house. Perhaps the most surprising benefit was the color I ordered (it was called \"burlap\" at the time but seems to be called \"tan\" now when I pull up the listing--not sure why?) actually helps to minimizes the orange in our dated honey oak floors to the point that I don't even mind the stain anymore. Note--I hung them right away since we had people coming, so I cannot speak to how they wash.",

                "reviewText": "I'm pleased. I wanted a natural plain curtain, and the linen-esque appearance drew my interest. I liked the subtle texture over totally smooth material. Grommet top with large grommet holes. I actually would have preferred a rod panel, but I could not find the equivalent in material, so I circled back to these grommet style panels. They work, I like them.I went with floor length (84\") and these fall perfectly into place. I bought 3 packs, so 6 panels all together, and they all appear to be even. Stitching looks good- simple but not cheap looking.Provides privacy yet lets in natural light. I really bought them mostly for looks. I have a wide picture window that I rarely close up. The other 2 sets (4 panels) are on a rod over a double sliding door that leads out into an unheated sunroom. We keep this door ajar all year long for our cats to be able to come and go from that window filled room, so I keep curtains up to help control heat loss (or heat coming in in summer). Ans yeh, maybe for a little added privacy.I appreciate the reasonable price. While I dont rate on price, I want to state that the price influenced my decision. I would have likely chosen something else had these not been $23.99 (with a coupon). Other colors are $10 more. Not too shabby, but it definitely made me choose these \"natural\" color, over the \"light beige\" option. The natural color reminds me of inside of a 3musketeers candy bar. Like a nougat lool.I also appreciate that these are 52\" wide. That helped me decide how many panels I wanted to purchase.",
