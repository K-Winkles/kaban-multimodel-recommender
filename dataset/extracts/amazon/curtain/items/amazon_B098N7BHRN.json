                "reviewText": "True, pure white color - not eggshell, beige or light gray like the other 4 highly-rated curtains I tried before this.Quality fabric - these are thick, not overly heavy (you don't want that on your curtain rod anyway) and they look absolutely premiumTotal blockout - these block ALL light that could go through them; the only light that can get through is from the sides or top/bottom of your window, but that's due to your curtain rod, not a curtain problem. (You want to search for a blackout/wraparound curtain rod, and properly hang it, if you care much about this.) Even with standard, straight across rods, these curtains will make day feel like night and drop your room temp almost immediately.Solid grommets - not heavy (again, that's not a good thing per se) but rigid and scratch free, not flimsy at allYes, these DO come slightly wrinkled. It's absolutely unreasonable to expect fabric shipped in the mail to be perfectly pressed. If the wrinkles bother you, steam them as they hang on the rod, or have them professionally cleaned and pressed. This is what professionals and people who like having nice curtains do.Yes, they probably will be ruined if you machine wash and tumble dry them, but this is generally true for nearly all curtains. Spot clean only for upholstery and home finishings is again pretty much standard, or at worst, hand wash for a serious issue. No one should be surprised by this or upset the laundromat ruined their curtains.This set really needs 6 stars to differentiate it from all the other curtains; they're truly better. Trust me, I've tried them all. Enjoy!",

                "reviewText": "We bought these for two sliding glass patio doors. They are thick and really nice. The blackout the light great. The only light coming through is around the edges, up at the top where the curtain rod goes through and at the bottom, where there is no black out lining. But no one is going to be able to see in through these curtains. They are pretty wrinkled out of the box, but an iron would probably solve that. I am lazy so I did not iron them. I'm hoping some of the wrinkles fall out. We are really satisfied with these curtains. The only con I would mention is that the two panels were not the same length. They were about 1/2 inch difference. We had bought two packages so we used the two short ones with each other and the two long ones. So you may have to order multiple packages to get a matching set and return some.",
