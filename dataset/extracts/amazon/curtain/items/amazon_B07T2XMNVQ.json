The velvet fabric is so soft and great quality, not super thick but that\u2019s fine with me so they aren\u2019t too heavy. I love the color BUT it appears very differently depending on your lighting. My window gets a lot of natural sunlight and the curtains appear very dark pink/almost red, which is okay but not my favorite thing. On their own the shade of pink is perfect, not too mauve and not too vibrant. I have another set of velvet curtains from the amazon brand MIULEE and these are significantly better quality. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "These curtains are beautiful and feel so nice and luxurious, and fit the price. But be aware of the lighting you keep in your room, they reflect light and shadows because they are velvet so the color might reflect in a different way based off tone and brightness of the lights you are using. I got orange curtains but they look more like raw sienna tin my space, but when the curtains are closed and my lights are off and the light shines behind the curtains they definitely look orange. I\u2019m keeping them, but putting them in my sons orange room so hopefully they will reflect more orange in his room, and I\u2019m going to try the rust red next at a longer length.",

I thought they would be a little more vibrant, however they are more of a dusty pink. The color still works well with my decor, so I am keeping them. They are very soft, and let through just the right amount of light so the room does not feel like a cave. It's been cool outside, do I do not know how well they will work to block the heat of a Florida summer. I would buy this brand again, but stick to colors that have been shared in picture reviews.",
