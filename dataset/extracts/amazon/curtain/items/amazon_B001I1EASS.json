I\u2019ve always been a fan of sheer curtains because they offer semi-privacy (I have a backyard in my apartment, and almost nonexistent to others). It also let the lights in when needed. They are lightweight and add the color to my living room. They arrived a little wrinkly, but it doesn\u2019t bother me. They still look beautiful. Great price! One of the best purchases!FYI, I used the command hook, and it works perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these panels (there\u2019s only one per pkg) and I was concerned about how dark they looked in the picture as I was shopping.When they arrived they looked way darker than I wanted, but I took one panel out of the pkg and held it up in front of the window - and I LOVE it! The crinkly look is a step up from the plain sheers I\u2019ve used for years, and the color is a nice departure as well. I can still see through them, light does come through, but the light doesn\u2019t glare the way it used to with my old off white sheers. This taupe color and the crinkly look make the room feel like it was designed by a professional designer, too.I\u2019ll probably replace all the old sheers in the rest of the house with these. I\u2019m very happy with this purchase",
