                "reviewText": "Our ac in Florida died in February and when the heat dome arrived mid-summer, we had enough and bought big window air conditioners.I had longer silver/gray blackout curtains in my bedroom that fit the window but didn't like bunching up the length on top of the window ac. It didn't make it easy to open and close them anymore.So I looked for white or off white blackout curtains to blend in with the white ac and panel in the window. I found two brands in the proper length and went with this one because I had purchased their sheers before.Well the first package I received looked like a repackaged return. The two curtains were folded differently, one had a blue crease in it and they had pet hairs all over. Ick! Thankfully Amazon exchanged them.The second package was everything I had hoped. The curtains were properly packaged new curtains. They are pretty thick for blackout curtains but that's likely how they can make white or off white in blackout (also costs more than dark colors). The quality was excellent.I didn't get the smaller rod pocket size I wanted but they slide so easily on my tension rod and look great. They hang nicely and wrinkle free. They are the perfect length - they hang about a half inch above the ac.",

The setup is simple and the curtains themselves look natural in a more muted room.When buying blackout curtains for the purpose of completely darkening a room, it is wise to go with their darkest color option to ensure the best results.These blackout curtains are a worthy purchase for anyone trying to make their room much darker.",

The only thing I would complain about is you can see light coming through the curtains, so if you're looking to cover and hide something up, this wouldn't be the best choice. If you're just looking to keep light out, then these are great!",

                "reviewText": "Not just for house windows \u2026 must haves. Epic price. Perfect more many uses.During renovations of a vintage 1900 property figured out having a curtain snug the windows is the best way to curb the cold and up the R value. Or, help during extreme heat.Another epic use, the Jeep used for travel like an RV is equipped with these on three sides in the back. Reflectix for the front window and custom made for the half door windows. Assisting in making the interior a tiny oven keeping us warm when the temp dips at night. And, keeps the light out easy peasy.Most windows we use one panel. Drawing them in the opposite direction using black spring loaded rods.This technique has helped during renovations for privacy. Keeps the rooms much warmer in winter. And, unless I move the curtain the smoking hot sun can\u2019t break the barrier.With the black out ability we\u2019re able to sleep in as needed. At home or on the road. Driving late into the night it\u2019s wonderful to sleep past dawn as needed.For those enjoying the travel option, for sound, train on brown noise throughout the year. Then, when camping on the road at Loves stations or anywhere, use brown noise \u2026 I plug the phone into my Jackery and use an app called White Noise that hosts unlimited Brown Noise, too.Mack\u2019s ear plugs for louder than normal stops with brown noise and a comfy face mask if the lighting in the stop is peeking through the sides of the curtains as an extra layer. You\u2019ll get exceptional sleep. With incredible sunrises.I like to park with the tailgate toward fields in places like Montana and the mountains along the coast. But could be anywhere.A big plus, discounts on second, third, and more orders of the same size.If you\u2019re looking for fancy, these can dress up a window with a linen curtain between the window and curtain. Using similar black spring rod.I prefer a single panel. If you\u2019re handy could cut the curtain in half. Stitch an edge. Custom fit to the window and now ya have two halves for opening both directions. Showcasing the linen panel underneath.I prefer a single linen panel. Shades the room from sun in summer. Offers a diffuse appearance that looks lovely any time of year.Hope this review is helpful for multiple uses.Happy decor hunting \ud83d\ude01\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaf",
