These curtains are not only aesthetically pleasing but also highly functional.I adore these curtains primarily because of their exceptional ability to block out sunlight. They do this job beautifully, creating a dark and serene ambiance in the room, perfect for getting quality rest or enjoying a movie during the day.Furthermore, these curtains have proven to be effective at helping to regulate the room temperature. They keep the room cooler during hot days, making them an excellent energy-efficient choice.If I have one piece of advice to share, it's this: make sure to measure your windows accurately before purchasing. I should have measured twice, resulting in a bit of inconvenience. However, this minor hiccup doesn't detract from the quality and performance of these curtains.In conclusion, the Joydeco Blackout Curtains have been a valuable addition to my living space. They excel in blocking out light and helping maintain a comfortable room temperature. So, measure your windows carefully, and you'll enjoy the benefits of these curtains in keeping your room cool and dark.",

                "reviewText": "The first purchase was for our garage door. The sole reason I purchased them was for the length and color. Imagine my surprise when they made a difference in the draft that used to come through the door. We use the garage as an extra living space so this discovery was amazing. Will it stop the draft altogether? No. But as long a you live somewhere where it doesn't drop below about 25\u00b0 at night you should be good.We purchased these curtains for our bedroom to help block out light. We also have full blackout curtains behind these but with them both together absolutely no light gets through. I can't speak for how they do on their own.The most recent purchase was thanks to mother nature and the cold snap that plunged most of the United States below freezing. Well below freezing! We live in a part of the country where the houses aren't as well insulated as they are up north and thanks to that the front of the house let's in a draft that no amount of weather proofing, door draft strips and door cushions can stop. I finally caved and bought yet another pack of these curtains. 10 feet long! I hung them up in our front entrance only a few days ago and while again I have to say they don't completely stop the draft I can say they block almost all of it. I'm talking a good 10\u00b0 difference from one side to the other. I've already shared the link with my neighbor because I think we can all agree that things cost enough right now, we don't need to be wasting money running the furnace constantly if we don't need to.I honestly can't say enough about these. They are actually saving us money because the furnace is no longer running constantly to try to combat the constant draft at the front door.",
