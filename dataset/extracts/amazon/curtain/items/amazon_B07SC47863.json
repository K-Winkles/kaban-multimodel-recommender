                "reviewText": "Love these! Nice weight without being cumbersome for a smaller rod (1\") at 48\" wide. These really make my daughter's room feel finished. The fabric feels wonderful, but it is absolutely not blackout. I was aware of this because of the reviews and it was not a feature I was concerned about since my daughter's room doesn't face direct sun at any point in the day. They have a few wrinkles, but I imagine they will disappear after a few days of hanging. The color is represented well in the photos and is a peachy color when the light shines through but it's a soft blush color otherwise. We put LED's around the window and they glow from behind the curtains adding some drama.I bought the 93\" curtains (I think that's correct - it was 90 something) and have 8ft (96\") ceilings. I hung the rod 2 1/4 inches from the ceiling and the curtains puddle slightly. I thought I would hem them to kiss the floor, but after hanging I like that I can pull them away from the window and the extra fabric helps keep them in place without needing hooks, so I think I'll keep them long.The loops at the back make these hang so beautifully and make such pretty pleats with zero effort. These are a steal and I can't imagine anyone not being happy with them. If your on the fence, you should do it!(:",

                "reviewText": "Great curtains - I bought the Blush pink velvet for a client - the curtains arrived quickly and are beautiful quality, especially for the low price. The color is very pretty and accurate to the photos on line. The only negative was the way they were shipped - they were packaged & delivered in nothing more than clear flimsy plastic wrap, not much more than Saran Wrap. The plastic had a hole in it, exposing the velvet curtain to the elements & the delivery guy left it on my step in the pouring rain (I have a covered porch where it would have been protected if he'd tossed it 6\" further in) - I realize that the seller of these curtains can't be held responsible for the carelessness of the delivery guy, but, slightly sturdier packaging would have been nice. Anyway, needless to say, when I took the curtains out of the plastic they had a big wet patch/water stain on them - I hung the curtains over a dining room chair & let them air dry (forcing myself to resist the urge to rub them dry with a towel or throw them in the dryer) & amazingly they did air dry without a hint of a water stain! So, all good, very happy, & my client is very happy too.",
