I like that they are green on both sides so outside you can see the color as well. Some reviews said they didn't have to iron but I needed to.DO NOT IRON THE VELVET SIDE!! Iron the back side on low steam setting. They add a classy cozy warmth to the room. I bought them for Christmas curtains but will leave them up through the winter. They do block drafts and light really well.I put 2 sets in my big window but probably could have done 3 sets. I did 1 panel in each regular size windows draped to one side for a little more of a dramatic effect. I ordered gold tassel tie backs but they weren't long enough for multi panels in the big window so I will get some kind of gold wide ribbon or maybe red/green plaid wide ribbon I had from last Christmas but not putting that up till I go full Christmas in a few weeks. I highly recommend you order these curtains,you won't be sorry. They look very expensive. I might order another set for my big window to make it more full and maybe add a second panel to each regular size windows. Don't hesitate to buy these. I've done my homework on tons of velvet curtains and these were the best choice. No regrets for me. So happy with my purchase!\ud83d\ude0d",

                "reviewTitle": "Exceeded my expectations",
                "reviewText": "I just ordered these curtains yesterday and, to be honest, my expectations weren't all that high. I was prepared to try them but also prepared to not be happy with them and have to return them. That's because there are so many factors to be considered, but these curtains do not disappoint.The colour is true to the description and posted photo, a soft blush pink that is absolutely gorgeous. This is one of the factors I was not hopeful about. So many \"pinks\" lean toward orange/beige/rust/dusty... anything but the soft pink I hope for, but these are perfect. I know lots of people would not put pink velvet curtains in their living room, but these come in lots of lovely colours. I don't care what other people would do or like, I am thrilled to find soft pink curtains!The size is as described, I measured them. The craftsmanship is excellent, with straight, even seams neatly finished. The fabric is so soft to the touch. It is not shiny velvet, which I feared it might be, such as you get with \"crushed\" velvet. It seems to be good quality fabric and care has been taken in their manufacture.For many months (probably a couple of years) my floor-to-ceiling living room windows have been uncovered. I have struggled to find curtains that I both like and can afford. Getting drapery made is extremely expensive so I have tried creative ways to cover my windows. Mostly they are just open for the world to see in, which restricts use of that area of my apartment during the evening when lighting illuminates all that's happening in the room and makes the inhabitants feel like they're on display. I sometimes put up a folding screen to block the view during special meals or any time there is company visiting.I am thrilled to find these lovely curtains and I highly recommend them. I will try to add photos after I get them up. I'm going to have to move the Christmas tree to do that, but I'm excited to see them in place. Ordered them yesterday, got them today. It will be a thrill to finally feel free to use the living room in the evening without worrying about neighbours seeing in.These curtains are made in China of 100% polyester. There is no odour to them (as there sometimes is with new fabric items just out of the bag) and, honestly, they could have been made by a local drapery company, considering how they look and feel. Very pleased with this purchase!",
