You do want at least 6\" length UNDER your window to abate sunshine from the looseness/angels. A couple more inches would have been even better, but the next size up was too long.THESE ARE WONDERFUL order with no reservations!!!! They are so perfect, and they do not arrive too stiff. Sure some fold marks, but to be expected, they are GREAT!",

                "reviewText": "I returned these only because the metallic silver design on grayish-white material was larger than expected & I wanted more of a blingy look for my turquoise, white & shiny silver bedroom d\u00e9cor. The price for an 84\" 2-panel drapery was phenomenal & will replace some sheers that were so much more expensive that I only bought 3 panels! So I got 4 panels for a great price instead of having to settle for less fullness! They are advertised as room darkening & they seem substantial enough to provide that. Also, the synthetic material is the kind that can be de-wrinkled on low setting of a dryer instead of a messy steamer. While the ones I reordered give me the look I want, (fingers crossed as haven't received yet!) they cost 50 percent more at 63\"L! Saves me from hemming them but more $'s for less material? So here's hoping the new order is of the similar substantial weight, room darkening & value. If not, thanks to Amazon's free returns, I'll keep trying until I get exactly what I'm looking for. I would recommend & purchase these drapes if I needed this more subtle design. Some colors were a few dollars more than others. Actually, I was very impressed with the look, the material & the price!",
