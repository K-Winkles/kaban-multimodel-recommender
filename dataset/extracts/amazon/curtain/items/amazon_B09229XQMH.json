The quality is excellent - just needed a quick steaming to remove the packing wrinkles and they were good to go. Love the textured fabric backed with the insulating layer on the back.

They definitely filter the light but I wouldn\u2019t say blackout. But I definitely wouldn\u2019t hesitate buying them again if needed.",
