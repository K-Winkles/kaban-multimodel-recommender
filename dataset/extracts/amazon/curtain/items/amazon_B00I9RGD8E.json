                "reviewText": "These are not lined in white so from the outside, the color of the curtain is what you see. I'll have to put up sheers or something so it doesn't look like a colored sheet from the street.Other than that, they were nice, hung well and looked good from the inside. the lack of a white lining is enough for me to mark them down, as typically blackout and thermal curtains have a white liner so that they look uniform from outside. My house faces South, so I hung them to check out how they looked, and due to a sunny day, most of the wrinkles have gone out. I'll still hit it with my steamer, but it was only wrinkled where it was folded, and the fabric doesn't seem to hold on to wrinkles a whole lot. The grommets were one sided, but that's really being picky at this price point.The red color is RED Brighter than the picture depicts. They also do a pretty good job blocking light and their thermal effectiveness is pretty good. I ordered 2X the width I needed (I have about a 90 inch wide space, so I ordered two 102 inch curtains) and they lay perfectly. The 'wand' is also interchangeable so that you can put it on either side of the curtain, which is nice.I also bought a set in Mineral (the slatey blue) and love them! They really darken the room (Moreso than the red) and the color is almost a neutral blue, if that makes sense. These are in my bedroom that also has blinds, so the lack of lining wasn't as much of a concern.They lie very flowy, without a whole lot of structure/body, but the fabric is stiff enough so that there arent' any bows in between the grommets. Adding sheers will give the curtains a little more body, so besides giving the outside a little more uniform appearance, you will have a more finished look for your window with sheers. The grommets were very large, and would accomodate most curtain rods (even a shower curtain rod; they're big!)",
