In fact, my only hesitation to a 5- star on these is that they are so bright it\u2019s like staring into an LED bulb sometimes! I decided to keep them rather than return and try finding a more subdued color, and in time I\u2019ve gotten used to the brightness of them. I have another set of blackout drapes that go over these at night, so mornings are not so jarring as opposed to using these exclusively. In other rooms I would say these would probably be more appropriate.",

                "reviewText": "These sheer curtains are great for letting in light while maintaining privacy. We have blackout curtains over top for darkness and even more privacy. These are just what I was looking for to replace some very sheer curtains that were easy to see through. It lets in a nice quality of light to the room as well which is a nice bonus. You can sort of see things through them (you can see the sky at the top of one picture) but there isn't much detail and for privacy while dressing but still having light, they're perfect. Someone would have to try very hard to see through them (especially because there's a tree in front of our window too). I notice that when direct light hits them, they're less see through, but when they are shaded they seem a little more see through, as the pics can show. Either way, I'm very pleased with these and I actually like that they don't touch the ground as well, making cleaning easier.",

                "reviewText": "As others mentioned this is a truly privacy curtain that really passes the light inside too. Sadly such curtains are so rare on Amazon! Technically a bed sheet has the same property, nothing can be seen on the other side but it passes light. I wonder why such curtains are so rare! I wish there were more colors available. Also the curtain doesn't look good really. It's more like a simple white bed sheet but I could not find anything else.",

Having said that they seem to be pretty well made. Unfortunately they arrived dirty, like where they were folded and the creases rubbed on the packaging or something. I'm going to wash them and hope whatever it is comes out. I don't want the hassle of returning them so I will put them up until I find exactly what I was looking for.",
