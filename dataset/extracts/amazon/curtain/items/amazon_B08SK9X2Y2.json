They are perfect. our ceilings are 8\u2019 tall, so we installed the rod almost to the top of the ceiling, and let the curtains pool 3-4\u201d on the floor, so the rooms look taller. Great buy; so happy with this purchase. These feel and look much more expensive than they are\u2026NOT a cheapy look. And they black out room fantastic when curtains are drawn. Oh and color is buttercream. Which was perfect. I read and looked at all of these reviews before buying, and read that the beige color, leaned more towards gray. I definitely did not want any gray or coolness to the curtains. I was going to get the oatmeal, but they were out of stock, so this was the perfect solution. They are the perfect neutral color !! Our walls are painted white, with the slightest hint of cream to it\u2026",

                "reviewText": "These curtains are definitely blackout, but placement is important. The way mine are hung I still have light coming through the sides and top, so keep that in mind (for any blackout curtain you order this is true). My curtain rods are1.25\u201d so the provided rings do not fit over them, the clip that dangles down is attached by a wire that reduced the internal diameter. The color is more of a grayish beige, but I like it. The fabric is textured and feels heavy. It has a plastic backing. Upon arrival I washed my curtains and line dried them as the instructions stated to do. They unfortunately were damaged line drying. You can see the image I posted where light is coming through, the clothes pin damaged the plastic backing creating this thinned section which allows light to pass through. I guess if you are going to line dry them put a small hand towel between your clothes pin and the curtain fabric. Also you can see in my second image that line drying warped the fabric. The middle of the curtain was the part that was attached to the clothes line, it is much wider than the other sections. I am going to steam these and see if it alleviates that issue.Overall I will keep them because it is difficult to find curtains and these are decent. I\u2019m not wow\u2019ed but I\u2019m not disappointed either. They will do the job and they are a nice color.Oh other thing to note. I ordered 3 sets. One of the sets was distinctly lighter in color. I didn\u2019t catch this until I hung them next to each other.",

After hundreds of tiktok videos and Google searches, I figured it out. You need the VIDGA curtain track system from IKEA that mounts to the ceiling. The system will come with all the accessories. You\u2019ll also need the hooks with the clips called, RIKTIG. This curtain also comes with clips FYI. These blackout shades were perfect and high-quality. The only feedback I have is they took forever to steam because the iron wasn\u2019t getting out the creases good enough. Other than that 10/10. Looks so elevated and sleek.",
