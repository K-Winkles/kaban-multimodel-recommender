I wanted true linen curtains or at least curtains that appeared to have a matte linen look to them. These were it! They still allow natural light to come through. I turned my blinds downside so that helped to reduce the light. But, if you\u2019re looking for room darkening curtains, these are NOT it. You can still see your blinds through these but they are not totally sheer. They are solid in color but they also have a nice minimalist pattern in the fabric that contributes to the linen appearance. They are NOT shiny at all. Again, they are matte. They also feel like linen cloth when you touch them. The quality is great! It took me 1 minute to hang and install them. They are medium weight, in my opinion. It was easy to get the wrinkles out. I would recommend using a steamer or iron to release wrinkles. Don\u2019t hang curtains with wrinkles in them. It makes the owner look like they just don\u2019t care, lol. Wrinkled curtains are tacky.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the color called crude which is a light beige since I wanted to keep the room lighter. I tried the taupe color, but it was darker than I wanted and returned them to buy the crude color which I like. When I took them out of the package, they had creased wrinkles. I tried spraying them with water and putting them into the dryer on a low heat to remove the wrinkles, but that didn't work. These curtains are only 15% linen, but they still held the wrinkles. I finally decided to steam iron them on a high heat and this worked to remove the wrinkles and creases.What I do like about these curtains is: 1) The look of linen. 2) The option of two methods of hanging them, rod pocket or back tabs.I chose to use the back tabs since I think it looks nicer and allows opening of the curtains more than using the rod pocket method. For a window 133\" wide, I ordered 2 sets of these curtains which would not have been enough if I didn't plan to have outer curtains that covered the stretched portion of these curtains. If these are the only curtains you will be using and plan to use the back tabs, I would suggest ordering 3-4 times the width of your windows to get some fullness.In addition, using the back tabs puts the curtain at the top of the curtain. If you are using another curtain with grommets as the front curtain, as I am, getting a front curtain of the same length could make the front curtain shorter than the back curtain since grommet curtains have at least 1\" of the curtain above the grommet. I ordered a 96 length for the outer grommet curtain, and when I hung it with this back curtain, it needed to be taken up only about 4 inches and not 6 as expected.I would recommend these curtains for the hanging options, but, if you are picky as I am, you will need to iron them. I hope this review was helpful for you.",
