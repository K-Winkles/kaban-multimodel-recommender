                "reviewText": "After reading reviews, I purchased the Oyster & Heather Gray to test out as I was after a lighter blueish tone. Oyster was a fail right from the package- I didn't see the blue hint others have mentioned... the overall color just looked like a cool dingy off white. The color can certainly change based on the lighting/time of day and current decor color of the room...but it was a hard pass for me. Plus I already have a lot of ivory/neutral furniture/decor which made the curtains look even more dingy. I initially didn't care for the Heather Gray either (also did not see the blue hues others have mentioned), but left it up for a couple days while I ordered further color samples...and it grew on me! I do now actually see just the slightest blue tint, so works for me! I'm waiting on the remaining panels and will update the picture. For now, here's my \"tester\" pic!As for quality, for the price, the curtains are excellent. Especially as I needed a 108\" length. The fabric is a nicely woven, heavy material with a back lining. Having three hanging options is a plus. The only downside is, while they are \"room darkening,\" the material still filters quite a bit of light through them. Even while gathered, you can see see a clear outline of the window/blinds where the sun filters through. Not ideal, but for the price, I can deal.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered Clay, Oatmeal and the blazer Grey (dark grey) because I couldn\u2019t tell by reviews which would look best with my greige wall. Clay is left, oatmeal is middle and dark grey is right. Ultimately I chose Oatmeal because I think it blended the best and looked the richest but I could see what people were saying about a slight green it gives off. The Clay is beautiful - it\u2019s a true light grey - but wanted to show a clear comparison between the 3 so you can avoid having to place multiple orders. The fabric is thick and does not feel cheap. These look and feel way nicer than the flax linen curtains I bought from pottery barn. They do block a lot of light which I needed (block 85 percent).",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased these curtains for my bedroom, and I must say, they have completely transformed my sleep and overall comfort. These curtains are nothing short of amazing!First and foremost, their ability to block out sunlight is exceptional. I'm someone who values a deep, uninterrupted sleep, and these curtains have become my secret weapon. They completely shield my bedroom from any unwanted morning sunlight, creating the perfect ambiance for a restful night's sleep. No more early morning wake-ups due to glaring sunlight streaming in \u2013 it's like having a personal blackout cave.What's also impressive is their ability to keep our bedroom a few degrees cooler. They seem to help regulate the room temperature. In the scorching summer months, they keep the heat at bay, allowing me to enjoy a cooler, more comfortable environment. I live in TX and it can get very hot here, so any degree cooler I'll take as a win!The quality of these curtains is top-notch as well. They are well-made, with sturdy fabric and durable stitching. I can tell they're built to last, which makes the investment even more worthwhile.Installation was a breeze (I used curtain hooks for this and then placed the hook on a ring). My husband and I finished setting these up in minutes.I couldn't be happier with this purchase!",

Both look really nice so it\u2019s personal preference.The blazer gray does have blue undertones, but the brownish tones in the gray make it look like a darker gray.I did start out with the birch color, but it was basically the exact same color as the paint I was hoping for some thing that was a little bit whiter. You can get more of a white from their website, but the price is much steeper .Quality is excellent stitching is excellent lining everything. Fantastic for the price!I suggest ordering multiple colors or the color swatches.",

                "reviewText": "Color is Sea Thistle . I decided to do a review because it\u2019s an unusual color with no reviews . I know the norm is to do neutral on the walls and add color with pillows and art . I just moved into my home so it\u2019s not fully decorated yet . I tend to lean towards white and neutrals. This color is really nice if you have different shades of grey , beige and taupe that are a little hard to blend in your home . It\u2019s a very nice color and it adds a splash of vibrancy and cheerfulness . It\u2019s got a coastal feel to it . I ordered the Birch and and oyster first but the birch was so peachy and the oyster all the beautiful was to grey . I wish the company had more color options in this style. The length is 108 . I have 9 ft ceilings but the carpet takes a little . In person they have a very dramatic feel. I couldn\u2019t do the rings unfortunately cause I don\u2019t want them to drag to much on my floors . Plus I\u2019m sure my kids will rip them right off lol. I ordered the extra wide ones so it would have some gather when closed . They have a nice velvety plush lining . I wish the lighting was a little better so I could take some better pics . But I have that north facing winter light right now . I hope this helps .",

I was worried the Color would be more \u2018yellow\u2019 than I wanted but it\u2019s actually a beautiful oatmeal color. Works well with my walls and furniture. Very happy with the quality, nice heavy drapes with weighted bottoms, and the inside is fairly darkening but not complete blackout. Lots of options for hanging, I opted for hooks so I need to hem mine quite a bit, I probably could have got away with the 84\u201d length. A little more than I wanted to spend, but overall worth the price. I would buy these again for other rooms in my home.",
