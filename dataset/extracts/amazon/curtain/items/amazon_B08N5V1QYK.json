                "reviewText": "After too many purchases and returns to count, I finally found exactly what I was look for! I have a very small home and wanted something for my dining room patio door that wouldn\u2019t make the room look even smaller. These sheers have the perfect amount of sheerness to allow us to still see outside when opened to a single panel thickness. And when evenly distributed, they also help to filter the direct sunlight that shines through in the morning without making the room too dark. We have two panels on a 5\u2019 sliding patio door and freely slide them in whichever direction we need. I love them!These sheers have weight to them. The fabric is substantial and not at all flimsy. And the nice open weave allows for a perfect filtering of light without making the room too dark. And because of their weight, I have had no trouble with wrinkles. And they are heavy enough that they do not blow all over when the slider is opened and we have a gentle breeze.The only downside, and it\u2019s not really a downside for me because I don\u2019t have neighbors out my back door; is that just like they allow you to see outside, they allow someone else to see inside at night when your lights are turned on. Not defined details, but more of blurred or shadowed shapes. So, if that\u2019s a problem for you, you may prefer something else. For me, these panels are perfect for my dining room! And the price was very fair for the product. I would definitely purchase these again.And, I like that unlike mounted vertical blinds, these sheers can be tossed into the washer! Because hey, life happens! I am very happy with my purchase!",

The 100\"W panel fits perfectly on our 72\"W patio door.I will buy 2 more to use in our dining room.",

                "reviewText": "First, these light, translucent, airy curtains are lovely. We started purchasing the white ones for our home a year ago, and they have held up well. One set in particular has been subject to opening and closing at the sliding glass door and doesn't show any signs of falling apart after a year.However, I recently purchased more for our home and was dismayed to discover a manufacturing defect in one set with the fabric not correctly seated under the grommet/ring. The second set ran short, at 82\" long instead of the 84\" advertised on the listing. It took ordering a third set to find one that was acceptable. Thank goodness Amazon makes it easy to return products. Additionally, I discovered that the curtains that I purchased last year were really 86\" long, not 84\". I didn't notice then because we were using existing curtain rods which I thought were at the wrong height. We're installing new rods anyway so now we have to deal with installing them higher or seeing if my spare set is shorter! Or if they shrink in the wash!For the price, these are really a bargain thus the 4 stars. Just know that if you purchase these, be prepared for some frustration in dealing with too long/too short/defective sets.",
