We bought another Eclipse set of panels at a local store when they were having a sale but even though they were advertised as blackout and thermal, they were not lined and they were pretty thin to boot. These Eclipse Curtains are very thick, and they are lined as well.Hopefully they will do a much better job of keeping the draft out from the doors in the winter, the heat out in the summer, and help us save on our energy bills. Not to mention I like the privacy from the blackout. part. Plus, the denim color goes nicely with the light green walls.",

They allow the sun in but they do seem to help keep suns heat from coming in. They also are solid so people can't see shadows from outside. They look nice and are just what I needed in my living room. You need to press them though as they hold the fold lines and do wrinkle. Not sure how washable they will be the lining seems to be plasticy. Hopefully they can be washed since I hate dusty curtains. Anyway they are good curtains for the price and look nice.

NOT UNHAPPY WITH THE COLOR, BUT I AM UNHAPPY WITH THE FACT THAT THIS IS BASICALLY A PIECE OF MATERIAL WITH 2 HEMS (TOP HEM AND BOTTOM HEM ARE EXACTLY THE SAME SIZE) .. THE MATERIAL IS PRETTY STIFF AND DOESNT FALL NICELY IN MY OPINION.... YES, I CAN SEE THE PICTURE...YES, IT IS JUST A BASIC ROD POCKET PANEL (WHICH IS WHAT SWAYED ME IN THE DIRECTION OF THIS CURTAIN AS OPPOSED TO A GROMMET CURTAIN), YES ITS BLACKOUT...IM JUST NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS AT ALL OTHER THAN THE COLOR...IT IS PRETTY MUCH DEAD ON TO THE PICTURE... BECAUSE I NEEDED A CURTAIN FOR MY BATHROOM, I WILL KEEP THIS FOR NOW AND TRY AND DECIDE ON A BETTER SOLUTION....IN MY OPINION, THIS DRAPE (YOU ONLY GET ONE) WOULD BE SUITED FOR A REC ROOM OR BASEMENT ....NOT IN MAIN LIVING AREAS....ITS JUST TOO STIFF AND DOESNT FALL NICELY...IT KIND OF FLARES OUT....JUST MY OPINION AS I MENTIONED...FOR THESE REASONS, I WOULDNT RECOMMEND THIS DRAPE",
