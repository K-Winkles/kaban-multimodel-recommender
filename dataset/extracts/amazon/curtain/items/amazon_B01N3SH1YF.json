They are a great color and a linen material which makes them a tiny bit sheer but really better than what I had up before. I love them. They were a great price and the measurements were perfect for what I needed. Definitely would order in the future. They were a great price for a set of two! Try them out. Great color options. I even ordered 2 sets for my son\u2019s bedroom in the denim color! Love!!",

These textured drapes are packaged very well with few wrinkles. A toss in the dryer using the steam function got the wrinkles right out. We purchased several pairs which hang in multiple rooms in our home. The seller ships promptly and refunds quickly as well. A color exchange was needed for one pair of drapes and all was handled professionally. These drapes filter the light and are semi-sheer, not darkening. They are easy to clean, hang beautifully and are well worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the H.VERSAILTEX Linen Curtains for our living room, and I have to say, they\u2019ve been a delightful addition to our home. Initially, I was a bit surprised by the thinness of the curtains as I expected them to be slightly heavier. However, they\u2019ve proven to be exactly what we needed.Despite being lighter than anticipated, these curtains do a wonderful job of softly diffusing the light, creating a warm, inviting ambiance that truly makes the room feel more homey. The price point was another pleasant surprise, offering great value without compromising on the look and feel of our living space.The natural color and the texture of the linen blend material have contributed significantly to the aesthetic appeal of our living room, adding a touch of elegance and simplicity that blends seamlessly with our decor. The nickel grommets provide a modern touch and make the curtains easy to hang, enhancing the overall convenience and look.Our recent family addition, a playful kitten, has taken a particular liking to the curtains, often seen climbing them in her moments of adventurous spirit. Yet, despite her best efforts, the curtains continue to hold up well, maintaining their nice look and contributing positively to our living room area.In hindsight, I am incredibly pleased with the decision to go with these curtains over more expensive alternatives. They\u2019ve not only met but exceeded my expectations, proving that sometimes, less really is more. For anyone looking to refresh their living space with something light, airy, and budget-friendly, I highly recommend the H.VERSAILTEX Linen Curtains.",
