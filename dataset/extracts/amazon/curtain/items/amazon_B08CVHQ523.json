For the price of two I thought they were gonna be janky but they\u2019re actually awesome. It\u2019s wonderful that they\u2019re curly because it adds to the ambience. When they\u2019re off during the day time the lights are shaped like water droplets so everything looks aesthetic still! I\u2019ve had lights with remotes before but this remote actually works really well and fast. The settings are cool but I just prefer to have them on constant. They look GREAT with the wisteria flowers I have hanging up and they don\u2019t produce heat so I can loop them throughout. Would totally buy again for the dorm! Btw I used the the small command strip holders for the part where the lights start and on the other side of my room I used gorilla putty and stuck the wire end to the wall.",

I heard this advice before I set up my lights and it saved my life. I\u2019ve had no issues with the lights; they\u2019re bright, the remote works, and it has multiply different settings you can chose from (my favorite is the second setting). Super cute, perfect for any occasion from weddings to decorating your own room!",

                "reviewText": "These lights are so cute. Theyre very easy to put up, just make sure you don't unravel the lights until AFTER they've been hung. The remote is trash and the buttons don't match the settings listed in this listing nor the instructions that come with the lights. It also doesn't work very well. I got them to turn on using the remote but that's it. Thankfully there is a button on the usb cord that controls the lights so I tend to use that. Overall very happy with purchase and would buy againUPDATED REVIEW: Unfortunately these have started dimming after only 2 weeks. They barely shine anymore. :/ I wouldnt buy these again",
