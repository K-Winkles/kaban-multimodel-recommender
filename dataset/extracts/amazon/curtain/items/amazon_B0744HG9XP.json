Measure the Length from the top of the window frame to the floor. (E to F) Determining Proper Width When measuring the width of your window (A to B), be sure to consider whether you are hanging your curtain hardware on the inside or outside of the window trim. If you are aiming for a fuller, gathered look, make sure to multiply your measurement by 2.5x. Determining Proper Length Consider the look you want to achieve and where you want the bottom of your curtains to fall. Panels are usually hung so they fall anywhere from the window sill (C to D) or to the floor (E to F). Typically, panels are hung 4 inches above the window frame. Helpful Tips: Consider pooling your drapes for a more dramatic effect, this means your drapes will gather on the floor. If you have baseboard heating, consider whether you want to cover or have curtains end just above the baseboard.",

Nowhere does it claim they are blackout curtains! These are ROOM DARKENING curtains. Look at the second photo in the listing. It shows you that there are 4 levels of curtains - light filtering, room darkening, blackout, and 100% blackout. See the gold border around \u201croom darkening\u201d? It tells you what level these curtains are.So, for those of you looking for \u201croom darkening\u201d curtains - these are great! Very nice quality and a great price!",
