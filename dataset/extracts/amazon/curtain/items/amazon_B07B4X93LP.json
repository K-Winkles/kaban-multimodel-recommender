Until I started having crazy insomnia and I was desperate for something that would help (besides hard meds obviously). Long story slightly less long, I bought these bad boys and suddenly my nighttime room is dark as the bowels of Khazad Dum. I had NO idea sleep could be this way. I can't even see my hand in front of my face. With my previous garbage curtains, I could make out every detail of my room and walk around with no additional light. Now, if I have to tinkle in the middle of the night or am at the beck and call of my monstrous overlord of a cat, I'm stumbling around like a mime trapped in a box. And they are lovely so that's a bonus! First picture is 8am, well after sunrise, and as you can see it's still dark as heck. Second pic is with lights on just to show how pretty the curtains are. Lovely thick velvet. Will definitely purchase more for other rooms in the house!",

                "reviewText": "Looking at the photos, it's obvious these drapes still need to be hemmed. I can do the pool but the puddle is too much for me.I ordered 6 panels and they were delivered the next day. I've spent the past 6 months since moving into the new house trying out different curtains and drapes. I initially hung sheer grommet curtains on single rods but wanted something thicker to help keep out the heat during one of the hottest SoCal summer ever. These velvet drapes are the 5th set I've hung. The 4th are the white cotton ones that I moved to the inner rods. I'm still debating if I want to keep them up. Let's not talk about the 3rd set of counterfeit curtains. I also changed the height of the rods, requiring longer drapes, and changed to double brackets to add a 2nd rod (the single brackets still need to be removed from the walls) to hang up sheer/light filtering curtains.I was really happy when I opened the first package of drapes and temporarily hung them up with clips to see how they draped. My biggest problem with the previous sets were how they draped. I ironed, steamed, trained, weighted, waited, and begged and was still not happy. The fabric of these drapes are nice and thick but not too heavy. I'm very impressed with the construction and stitching. The color is exactly what I expected although I was on the fence about ordering these greyish blue ones or a different brand in a deep aqua color.The drapes are not perfect but I have no complaints for the price. My drapes wish list items include:1) Additional hanging options other than rod pockets. Back tab or a header/pleating tape would have been nice. I did consider adding pleating tape but I wasn't sure I wanted the formal look of pleats. I wanted to hang these with curtain rings so they're easier to open/close but I didn't like the look of the clips on the fabric. I ended up ordering metal drapery hooks from Amazon and hung the hooks on curtain rings. I started placing the hooks 4 inches apart (for a total of 14 per panel) based on recommendations by drapery pros but I didn't like the look. I changed the spacing and used a total of 9 per panel. I think I would have used back tabs if these panels came with them.2) Weighted hems would have been nice. They're included with many higher end drapes. But it's not a deal breaker since they drape fine without the weights.3) Length - I would be a happy camper if manufacturers made 87\" or 88\" as the standard length and got rid of the 84\". 84\" is too short and 95\" is too long and I don't want to lose the beautiful hems by getting them hemmed. This probably would not be an issue for me if I knew how to operate a sewing machine.4) Wider than 54\" panels. 54\" is actually wider than other panels I've seen and double panels cost more than 2x the amount for 2 panels. I need about 1.5 panels for perfect fullness. 2 panels on each side is a little too full. Maybe I'll order additional panels and figure out how to add half a panel to each panel.All in all, I have no complaints about these drapes. I would have had to spend much more on custom drapes made to my exact specifications. These will stay up and I will move on to my next project. I may revisit deep aqua velvet drapes or gold rods in the future.",
