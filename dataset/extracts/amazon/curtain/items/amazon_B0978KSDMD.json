Not knowing what to expect, I really needed curtain for my living room so I took a chance on these and I am glad I did! I was extremely surprised at the quality of these curtains! I love them! They feel soft and thick and they keep the light out, I can not see through them at all even when the sun is shining. They have worked well to keep the cold out too. They hang well and look great. I just ordered more today for my sons room and will likely be getting more for my bedroom. Great curtains for the price!",
