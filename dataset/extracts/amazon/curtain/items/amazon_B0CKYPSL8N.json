They are sheer but the crushed sections don\u2019t make it feel like they can be easily looked through. I don\u2019t know how long these will last compared to more expensive crushed voile curtains I\u2019ve had for about 10 years (and you can tell is better material) but aren\u2019t made anymore. However, with the price for 2 Panels just under $5.00, I\u2019d definitely recommend them. Peace!",

They look nice out of the package (I didn\u2019t even iron/steam them), the fabric is stiff enough to set folds in and more or less stay.They look a lot nicer than the previous linen ones. The quality is ok- one of the packs I bought didn\u2019t have a header (just one pocket on top was sewn in) so be careful and check.They fit well, as long as you double up your window width.Overall, not bad.",
