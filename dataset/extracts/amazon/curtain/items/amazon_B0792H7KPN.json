Make sure you have a smaller curtain rod if you're going to purchase these.",

However, the fabric is definitely *not* light blocking. It is a single layer of fabric, not multi lined or with any opaque fabric. That was a disappointment, as the listing said it was a 99% blocking curtain. In the attached picture you can see how much light bleeds through, because you can see the shadow of the mid-point window frame near the bottom of the picture.",
