I was not sure about the description of single panels in each color so I only ordered one set to see if too much with my rug and wasn\u2019t sure about single panels. I loved them! They are a single panel in each color. I have 3 windows and I ordered a second set. I am using 4 panels on each window. I leave them open so 6 panels were really full. If you close them, 6 panels would be perfect. Love them as much as my area rug",
