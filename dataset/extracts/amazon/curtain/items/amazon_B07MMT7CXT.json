I bought 5 packages of these because I have a lot of double windows in my living room. I did trim the ends due to them being too long but my windows must be a weird length. Would definitely purchase these again if I need more. The color was a perfect linen cream and I have also painted my walls White Dove since this picture was taken and the curtains blend well with the new wall color. I\u2019ll update with a more recent picture.i also hung them up right out of the package, didn\u2019t need to iron but could probably take a steamer to them for perfection.",

You can pull back the colored or sheer panel or both to change the look. They block a good amount of light and the sheer panels make the room feel more feminine and airy. The fabric is soft and medium thickness - do not feel or look cheap.",
