All the side seams and rod pockets a neatly sewn. I got these to use as dust protection in book cases There are two 40x63\"panels per package one package per book case mounted inside the wooden frames using small tension rods gives perfect protection and concealment to shelves contents. These are so reasonably priced and come in a variety of colors I am considering ordering additional sets to change up the look in the room.",

The rod-pocket top does not have that middle stitch that most rod-pocket curtain panels have, so you can\u2019t put it through the rod and get that top \u201cruffle\u201d effect. I\u2019m debating whether I should buy thread and run that extra stitch or just return them and try to find what I\u2019m looking for. The color is gorgeous, and they were a good price.",

I brought three packs but I used one pack to cover the table stand on each side of the spa and I used two packs on the window because I wanted it very ruffled but only one pack is needed to spread it across a window of this size. 1 pack comes with two panels and I paid about 11 bucks per pack. They are NOT sheer just thin. If you put a flashlight in front of it, I guess you may see what's behind a little bit but it's not sheer. For example: if you wore it is a dress then your whole body can not be seen through it. Hope this helps!",
