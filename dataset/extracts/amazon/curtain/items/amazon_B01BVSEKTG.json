                "reviewText": "We purchased 3 panels in teal. The color matches with one another and the Amazon listing. As they're folded, they'll have wrinkles when unfolded. After hanging for about 3 weeks, nearly all the wrinkles have come out and we're pleased with how they hang and look. I wouldn't call these curtains heat blockers (or insulators for warm or cold weather), nor would I say they are special light blocking draperies. I have purchased drapery from a different Seller that have the sun and weather backing on the reverse side of the drapery and they truly work well (they're ivory and it's amazing how well they block light). These teal drapes are not cheapy curtains that let the sunlight filter through like sheer drapery, but certainly not light blockers either. The grommets are fitted well and all three panels (separate orders) are the same length. For these draperies, we did not purchase them with the intent of being light blockers, not temperature insulators; we just wanted some long, reasonably priced teal curtains for our sliders, these meet our expectations for that purpose and deserve our 5 star review.",

They're not sheer but they definitely let in as much light as my traditional curtains and I don't think the backing is preventing the heat from getting through. I was hoping for both. That said, they are beautiful. They hang smoothly and the color is exactly what I wanted. They have a light, silky feel but so far, don't seem to be the pet hair magnet that silk usually is. They seem well made and I expect they'll last years. While the windows are well covered, I might buy extras to try to add/thicken coverage to help with the room darkening. Especially the south facing window. Overall decent purchase but if you need a really dark room, these won't do that. Picture looks as if curtains don't cover the window. That's just the morning cats/dog having to watch the rabbits. Lol",

I do want it to help block some of the cold air from getting in when it's cold to help save on heating bills so we shall see.They did come pretty wrinkled but it's nothing an iron or steaming cannot fix.

                "reviewText": "I originally ordered 4 of these but only opened 1. The blush pink is more of a cool dusty pink, and would go better with grays and blues than browns and beiges. I wound up ordering similar deconovo curtains that cost me about $17 more for the total 4I knew what I was getting into ordering the cheapest 95\" curtains you can find on amazon. They are pretty thin, and expect the lines of sunlight that shine through your blinds to show through these. More crimps help, but these do a good job of softening and diffusing light.I didn't rate them higher because the panel I opened and inspected was actually slightly slanted at the bottom, as in it hung so that the left bottom corner hung just over an inch lower than the right. If you're tying these up to use as accent or letting them really pillow on the floor around the window, I don't think it would be really too noticable.I wound up returning all 4, but moreso over the color than the quality. The picture is of the two panels side by side. It's a clear bump in quality and the deconovo curtains are very near blackout in my west facing florida window in the summer, compared to the sunzero which were really barely passable as thermal curtains. The seams and stitching, as well as the backing are a much higher quality on the deconovo panel. You can also see the difference in the satin sheen, but really, a lot of these factors come down to preference, and they are a really affordable alternative if you don't need the heftier curtains.The return went very smoothy and I'm happy with the customer service, but I still want to point out the inconsistency in length, and the sheerness of curtains that are really going to disappoint people who look at the marketing and think they'll block a lot of light.",
