They give a nice pink hue to your room when the sun is out, and I loved this since pink is my favorite color and it was always just super nice and soft lighting to wake up to. They perfectly fit the size of my big window which is great because it\u2019s hard to get a size this big. They are thick and heavy but lighting was still able to get through\u2026 just not too much which was great! I placed a white accent curtain on top to give it more style but still cute without it.Very cute curtain\u2026 a good buy!",

I like that they let a little light in but allow some privacy.They are very pretty and seem heavy and well made. I was glad to see they didn\u2019t have creases so I was immediately able to hang them. I used hooks and clips to hang from the rod and it worked fine. They bring a nice texture to the room! I really like them! I overlooked that they come in a two pack so I accidentally bought an extra package\u2026so just a note to other buyers. It is a 2 pack!",

                "reviewText": "I cannot say enough good things about these curtains. I am currently remodeling a spare bedroom and doing it Boho style - of course. My expectations for these curtains was extremely low but let me tell you!! These so amazing. The color is perfection and what I expected, the style is ever more beautiful in person, the detail is definitely better then anticipated. The quality is sturdy, but not heavy. The quality, color, cost and style far exceeded my expectations and I want to buy more for the rest of my house. These let just the right amount of light into the room without creating a dark space. STUNNING! If you have these in your cart - presss BUY NOW - you won't regret it.Hope this honest review was helpful :) CR",

                "reviewText": "These curtains are super heavy! They feel like a linen/poly blend (definitely not full linen,) and they wash and dry like a dream. There were no wrinkles, even after leaving them crumpled in a pile for 8 hours while at work. Wrinkle-free is a must.The embroidery is larger than expected, and the rod pocket is super wide so any rod size would fit.The fabric blocks out most of the sunlight, which is perfect for us. So these are definitely slightly sheer, and they are not blackout as stated (which is easy to tell from the photos anyways.)Size is as stated. Im very impressed.Pros:-high quality-wrinkle-free-wide rod pocket-fabric blend feels luxuriousCons:-would love to see more color selections-Does not have matching ties (I know it didn't say it would, but some tassel tie-backs would have made these even better.)In short, buy these. Seriously. We have gauze curtains in the rest of the room and these match so well with everything.If you could also sell some matching throw pillows, I'd love that.5 stars!*photos were taken on a very sunny afternoon.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I recently purchased the boho curtains for my room, and I couldn't be more delighted with my choice. Firstly, the beautiful color of the curtains is exactly what I was looking for to add a touch of vibrancy to my room. The attention to detail in the stitching is remarkable \u2013 the seams are perfectly done, reflecting a high level of craftsmanship and quality. What I appreciate most about these curtains is their perfect balance in thickness. They are not too thick to create a blackout effect, allowing just the right amount of natural light to filter through. At the same time, they're not overly thin, providing ample privacy and a lovely drape. The overall quality of these curtains is outstanding, and they have truly transformed the ambiance of my room. I would rate these curtains a solid 10/10 for their beautiful aesthetic, impeccable stitching, and versatile thickness. I love them!",
