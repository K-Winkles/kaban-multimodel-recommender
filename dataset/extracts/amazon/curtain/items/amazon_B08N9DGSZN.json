These thermal insulated curtains in Charcoal Gray not only add a touch of elegance to the room but also serve a practical purpose. The set of two panels, each measuring 52 inches by 108 inches, ensures that my bedroom stays comfortably dark and cool, allowing for uninterrupted sleep even on the sunniest mornings.What I love most about these curtains is their quality. The solid grommet drapes feel substantial and durable, giving me confidence that they will last for years. They also effectively block out light and noise, creating a peaceful and serene atmosphere in my bedroom.Additionally, the grommet design makes installation a breeze, and they slide smoothly when I want to let in some natural light. These curtains have truly transformed my bedroom into a cozy sanctuary, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. If you're looking for high-quality blackout curtains that enhance both the aesthetics and functionality of your room, I highly recommend the H.VERSAILTEX Blackout Window Treatment Curtains.",

I ordered light sage and white for my large east-facing living room windows about 6 months ago and they have kept the living area SO cool through the summer months. The light sage let the smallest bit of light through when the sun is directly shining through my window, but are completely opaque when the sun is in any other position. The white let through much more light, to the point that I would not call the white curtains \"blackout\" curtains. They are opaque and preserve privacy, though. Both white and light sage also feel very warm when touched, so I know they are absorbing much of the morning sunlight's heat. I just ordered a second set for my dining room, which also faces east. As a bonus, these curtains feel very nice and soft the touch and hold up VERY well to my two cats! My old curtains were shredded less than 6mo after purchase and these still look brand new!",

I hope I\u2019m able to wash them in the machine is still so soft and it does keep a lot of the light out but wish it had more of a blackout to it but they are all awesome. I wish it came in two and still having to buy one in a pack in the house of another that you don\u2019t know with that you have to read the small print people, because I had to wait a couple of days before I can finish all of my curtains because I bought wish there was more than one in the package, though they are very thin very very thin and they do not block out the sun which that was what I was asking for but they\u2019re pretty and they\u2019re soft and easy to use. Easy to hang. They look nice anyhow .",

                "reviewText": "We've hung two of these curtains in entryways near exterior doors to block the draft for the winter. They're hugely effective! It's often a notable difference on the other side of the curtain, and the power savings have already paid for them. These are an aesthetically pleasing alternative to the plastic thermal barriers in doorways. We used simple tension rods to hang them in archways and cut-throughs.",
