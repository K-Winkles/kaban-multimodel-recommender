                "reviewText": "As someone who works night shifts, finding curtains that could truly blackout the daylight was my mission. The PONY DANCE Blackout Curtains have been a game-changer. Upon hanging them, I was impressed by the immediate plunge my bedroom took into darkness. The curtains not only block out the light but also help dampen the sounds of the busy street below, allowing me to sleep soundly during the day. They feel durable yet smooth, and I\u2019ve noticed a slight decrease in my room\u2019s temperature, which is a bonus. They\u2019re a sanctuary for a restful day\u2019s sleep, and I\u2019ve never felt more refreshed for my nocturnal duties. Oh, and the color is spot on.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for blackout curtains that are on the affordable side and this is what I bought. Since I was looking to save money and not spend ridiculous $$$ for pieces of fabrics that can easily be sewn and hemmed, I wasn\u2019t expecting much but this turned out to be functional and also, nice. The fabric itself is not thick, like in hotels, but almost. It could pass for something that looked more expensive too. Textile is thinner than I would like, but they filter and reduce the amount of light passing through my window. Overall, I\u2019m happy with this purchase but I would definitely invest in a more expensive set if I\u2019m looking to beautify a bedroom (I wanted to make my room look like a hotel\u2019s because I used to travel a lot and got used to sleeping in darker rooms in hotels but saving is a priority). I bought the gray and I would add sheer accent curtains to these. The lights don\u2019t pass through on the top (depending on how the position of the rod brackets, the closer they are to the wall surface, the less light passing through on the top) unlike the grommet top types of curtains with ring holes. it was also a deciding factor for me. Glad I found these curtains, not overpriced... they shouldn\u2019t be. All in all, my room in significantly much cooler now especially during peak hours where the sun is hitting my window. And it did bring the room temperature down quite a notch and beautify the room. I wish they come pleated though to create a more dramatic clean look (see last pic I posted of the look that I want, this are the pleated curtains we have at home) but these do reduce heat and light! And this, I slept without waking up at all for 10 hours straight for several days already since I've had them, that's a really big deal for me. Helped me recharge. Thank you to the seller for selling these curtains at an affordable price!",
