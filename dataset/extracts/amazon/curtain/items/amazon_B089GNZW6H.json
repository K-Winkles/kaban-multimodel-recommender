                "reviewText": "I am very impressed with these curtains. I was a little nervous that they wouldn't be good quality due to the great price or that they wouldn't actually block the light but they are really great curtains! They are a soft material which I think make them look like expensive curtains. They block out light extremely well, maybe too good. I actually had to open them up at night because it was too dark in my room. I bought the navy color and while they aren't as dark as I think navy color should be (they are more between a royal blue and navy color) but they are actually the perfect color to go with my walls which are a light blue. Please note, the color in the photos look darker than they actually are. I couldn't get a good picture of the color. And, please people, take a few minutes to iron your curtain before you hang them (or steam or even dampen and put in dryer to get rid of the wrinkles). You only have to do it once in your life and they look so much better without wrinkles. I saw way too many reviews where they just hung the curtains straight from the package and they look horrible. It took me 10 minutes to iron these and they look great. I like these curtains so much, I am going to buy more for the other rooms in the house.",
