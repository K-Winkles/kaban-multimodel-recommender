                "reviewText": "I searched online and in stores looking for the right style, color and weight of drapes to change the dynamic of my living room. After comparing many different brands and reviews, I decided to take a chance on these. I'm so glad that I made this choice. It can be difficult when purchasing drapes online, because you can't gauge the real color or weight of the fabric, but I was so pleased that the color is spot on. Additionally, the weight is perfect! I'd call them mid-heavyweight, definitely not lightweight or cheap. They provide just enough sheerness to allow the light to come in, but they don't block out the light.The grommets are not cheap looking. No chips or sharp edges (as can happen with some grommets), and they appear to be well made.I'll definitely be purchasing more to dress up my office.",

My accent wall is plum taupe by Behr. Room still in progress but they\u2019re worth it.Update: I work selling window treatments and I tested out two panels. I just got around ordering two more to give fullness. I kept trying to see if I wanted another set of sheers or do opaque panels on the sides but I chose to add sheers. On the markets custom styles can really add up so I\u2019m glad I got these for a fraction of the cost. Love them! I\u2019ve added two new photos to compare two panels vs 4 panels on a window over 72 inches wide. Now the height is shorter than I\u2019d like but the 96 inch was too long for my style.",

They are a great balance of sheer while also providing the privacy you want without adding in another curtain set behind. They allow light in during the day, but also enough coverage at night. They didn't come wrinkled and haven't wrinkled, so that has been GREAT. Highly recommend!",

Two, 50\u201d valances spanned our 66\u201d window with just enough fold for a loose pleated look. The color is true white which offered the casual, beachy look we were after (over top of an existing white fabric shade). We plan to hang them on a brushed nickel rod a few inches above window frame (which the 18\u201d length allows for). Seams are consistent, wrinkles are minimal and they are well made. Very pleased with the purchase.",
