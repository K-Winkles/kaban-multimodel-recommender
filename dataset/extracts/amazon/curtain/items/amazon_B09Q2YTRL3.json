There is no foul smell, it literally smells the way brand new stuff smell and if you dislike the smell of new then just wash them or spray some diluted fabric softener. They are beautiful, thick, good quality, true to color (I am impressed at how nice the color is) and are indeed 100% blackout. No this isn\u2019t a paid review as you\u2019ll be able to see, it\u2019s an honest review from someone who almost didn\u2019t get them because of the other reviews. They look and feel a lot more expensive than what they are and they very minimally wrinkled which is expected from being folded in transit. GET THEM!! You need these!!",

I work from home and the sun glare off my neighbors house with white siding and cloud cover and sun changing throughout the day (and seasons) make it difficult to see my computer screens. I have always had a sensitivity to sunlight. These are effective and look great. I purchased the \u201cgrayish white\u201d and love the textured look of the linen fabric with the color. My only critique is there are lines from the folding/packaging that I could not get out. I tried a steamer and ironing with lots steam and high heat. Hung them for weeks and they\u2019re still visible. I would not expect regular wrinkles to be this stubborn for the curtains, these lines are clearly from the tight folding and packaging.",

The ONLY downside is that it\u2019s very hard to completely remove the wrinkles. I put them through the washer and dryer and they still had very distinct crease lines from the way they came packaged. I steamed them next which helped a little bit... but I still wasn\u2019t able to get the wrinkles fully out. They\u2019ve been hanging on a curtain rod now for 1 month, and still they have a few creases lol. I\u2019m okay with it though because otherwise they look very very beautiful, and they do completely blackout the room which is the main reason I bought them",
