Please follow instructions to avoid damage, the backing is some sort of plastic or something. In my opinion they are a good value. I plan on buying them again for another room. My caveat is to ask seller to inspect the panels before shipping them out to you. As one of my panels had a small black dot that also shows up in the backing. I suspect that these drapes aren\u2019t stored properly. Hope this helps your decision making.",

I have so many sets in my storage that it is embarrassing, but I have never been more disappointed than with these. I first tried drying them with a wet towel to get out wrinkles and it didn't work at all so I tried washing them and drying each panel separately, hanging them immediately. Still a wrinkled mess. I tried leaving them hung for a few days to see if it would relax wrinkles. Didn't change them a bit. Now I am ironing them with full steam, full heat and the wrinkles do not relax a single bit as you can see in the picture. (Hanging they look much worse.) Honestly these are the worst curtains I have ever purchased in my 68 years. On a side note, I have purchased from this company several times with fantastic results.",
