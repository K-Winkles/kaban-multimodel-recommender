                "reviewText": "I decided I wanted to change the window coverings in my living room (that have been there a long time). I wanted something that I could pull closed as well as pull back to let in the light. I didn't want blackout curtains and I wanted something that was a solid color (no prints). When I saw these, I really liked them. They are very well made of a woven linen/polyester blend and they have a real natural look. They are sheer enough to let in the light, but when closed will provide a bit of privacy. When they arrived, they were a bit wrinkled where they had been folded, but the creases were easily ironed out. I don't think going forward they will wrinkle much. I am very happy with the finished look and I would definitely recommend these curtains. They are a great value for the price.",
