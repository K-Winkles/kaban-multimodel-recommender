I only see these pretty flowers in the room. I have a pet hamster hiding in the closet, just on the other side of the curtains. I went in and know that she can see me from the other side and can feel safe and cozy in the closet. The curtains achieved the goal I had. They are colorful too. I was worried the colors would be light and almost washed out since they are sheer. That wasn't the case. I also bought decorative vines and string lights that enhance the atmosphere. Thumbs Up!",
