They are fabulous curtains! I was stunned at the heft and weight. The reason I am giving 4/5 stars is only because I thought they would be a bit more sheer and the white stripe in the panel is a bit too white for what I am needing. However, I am keeping them and using them in another room! I ordered another set in green!",

I love matching stripes and will put these up inside the 2 that are already up and they will look smashing!",

Being a 2-pk was great as we ordered 4 but used only 3 and kept one as a spare (just in case), you know how stuff comes and goes on Amazon. This was a great deal and we love them.",

I will live with it cause they are quite nice and cant beat the price - maybe the pink will fade with wash and wear - I love the curtains! I bought 4 panels for our sliding glass doors for fullness and full coverage.",
