The perfect length to be a fire hazard for my heater. I ended up using safety pins to temporarily hem them, and since then they have been an absolute dream.I work nights and often find myself going to bed hours after the sun comes up, but with these curtains you can legitimately trick yourself into thinking the sunlight from 1 pm is nothing more than a light down the road at midnight.",

The color was almost exactly the same from the website, and these do a very good job of blocking out the light. The window side is a gray, thermal material, and seems to effectively keep the heat in/out when they are closed. I felt they looked just like the pictures, and would recommend as a cheap yet effective way to decorate the windows in your home, especially if you want the thermal layer.",
