                "reviewText": "This company/brand sells many different types of curtains. I know because I spent way too much time down a curtain rabbit hole and ordered several different ones. These are hands down the best!They\u2019re not expensive, but they look like they are. really solid and well made. I bought the white ones, and they are a very clean bright white. They also have a nice wide hem at the bottom which cheap curtains do not. They\u2019re also soft, which I like.Each panel arrives folded in a clear plastic sealed bag. Obviously there were some wrinkles along the fold lines, but the rest of the curtain is wrinkle free. I hung them and the wrinkles softened after several hours, and I\u2019m confident I can get what\u2019s left out with an iron.As far as blackout feature, I\u2019d say they block 70%. If you want full blackout, their faux linen line, which I also tried, is 100% blackout. Those curtains are thicker and not soft, but they still look nice and def do the job.I highly recommend these curtains. I bought 5 different sets of curtains before I found these. Very happy!",

I have blinds behind there so if I lower the blinds my room is almost blacked out so that\u2019s not a problem.

                "reviewText": "I wish I had more windows so I had a reason to buy more of these curtains!It took me a while to finally pick a curtain because they are all so gorgeous, but I finally settled on charcoal. I was looking for some long panels to visually open up the tall frameless window in the bedroom while also blocking light. Our linens/decor is largely in a grey palette, but kind of all over the place as far as tones and hues, some very greenish, some warm, some steely blue. To make matters worse, our furniture is a mishmash of mid-century walnut originals and contemporary laminated particleboard in black, brown and black-brown. So I was really hoping maybe some curtains would coordinate it all. I checked out the charcoal, taupe and grey and was completely unprepared for how terrific they all were. These panels are nice and weighty, but not heavy enough to make my widespread curtain rods droop. (I thought I might have to install a ceiling support, phew!). Although the product photos show the texture of the knit up close, the photos don't do them justice. You really have to see them in a room. There's a slight shimmer to the knit which doesn't at all show up as shiny or metallic, but subtly reflects so many complimentary tones in all different lighting. (You could probably purchase any shade of these H. Versailtex curtains for literally any color decor, and it would miraculously tie the room together.) Also, I never heard of this company before stumbling upon them on here, amazon for the win!PROS:- Definitely \"room darkening\" and not blackout, which I prefer. We tried blackout curtains and thought they were great until we woke up at 3:30pm and very confused. These block out enough light to sleep in comfortably, but not like an isolation tank.- Pretty, smooth, brown grommets. Antique bronze or whatever, I worried they would clash with my pewter rods, but just like the curtains themselves, they compliment the decor. I also appreciate the clean line- they're not stamped with weird embellishments and so there's no drag and it pulls smoothly without whatever you call that circular maneuver is when you're wrestling a drape that got stuck. (The ability to open and close efficiently is something I look for in a window treatment.)- Quality, straightforward packaging. Vinyl and a zipper go a long way. Nothing screams disappointment like new fancy drapes packaged like something someone forgot to pick up at the dry cleaners.CONS:- Compelled me to write a lengthy review about curtains, which I've never done before and am unsure how I feel about that.I am just a regular amazon shopper who paid full price and would do so again. I just happen to think these are terrific and deserve a strong recommendation:)",
