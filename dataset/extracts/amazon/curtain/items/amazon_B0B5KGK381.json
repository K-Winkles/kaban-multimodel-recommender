                "reviewText": "I had very nice curtains on my bedroom window for over 25 years, unfortunately on August 19,there was a fire on the first floor of my apartment building, I'm on the third floor but above in the same area of this apartment. The fireman wrongly had ripped off my curtains and bent both curtain rods and and when I tried to put them back on I couldn't,and the next day I tried again and one of the rods broke off! They also ripped off one of my living room longer curtains too,but they can be put back on the rod.Anyway I have always had blinds underneath my curtains but it's still too bright from sunlight in my bedroom and I liked the look of the curtains much better,they match my comforter too, so I got this AJAZZ stick on curtain in the biggest size because my bedroom window is big,but it still doesn't cover the whole window,it almost does but there is a little exposed parts on both sides,but it's better than nothing at least for now. I used to have a measuring stick long fold up ruler many years ago, I just ordered a new one so I can measure my drape and window sizes.These curtains do look really nice though and they block out most of the sun and this curtain was pretty easy to put on the window top frame and so far the Velcro is totally stuck on.",

                "reviewText": "so I had to return this curtain because it really was not 100% block out as it said it was it also did not stick very well. The adhesive for strong, but it just would not stick maybe because the surface I was trying to stick it on Was textured, but either way it should be able to adhere. It looks cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for I suggest looking at curtains that have a thermal block because I put these in my daughter\u2019s nursery and noticed it was getting very hot and that these curtains do not have a thermal lining and when you live in Texas, it\u2019s really necessary to have something that has a thermal lining to ensure that it keeps the nursery. Nice and cool.",

One star off because the adhesive detached from the wall the first time we stuck it up. We moved it to the window frame (glossy paint, totally smooth) and it\u2019s mostly still stuck on there. We\u2019re renting and didn\u2019t want to put holes in the wall, so this is a good solution. We\u2019ll stick with it (no pun intended) until we move out.",
