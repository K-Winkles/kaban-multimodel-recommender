                "reviewText": "I just needed something to cover the windows so the room doesn't look so plain while still allowing light in to keep it bright during the day. I had originally installed sheer white but that was too see thru and did not look good to me. I came across these grey sheer curtains for a low price and got a 45\" set and a 63\" set for the 2 different sized windows in the room.I think they look great. They still allow plenty of light in but are just dark enough to blend out all the trim.Out of the package they are all creased and wrinkled so I ironed them. My iron has settings 0-10 and I ended up using setting 4 which worked quickly, 1 or 2 passes while pressing the steam button and the wrinkles came out easily. Wish they didn't have tags on them but was able to cut most of it off.I would buy these again if I needed more curtains.",
