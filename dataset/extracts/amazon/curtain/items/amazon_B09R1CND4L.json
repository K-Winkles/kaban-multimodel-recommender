                "reviewText": "Lovely, understated romantic light filters into my bedroom/office space and I love it!I put these in the dryer on low with a damp washcloth for about eight minutes just to knock some of the creases out and as you can see, they turned out so fine and all the other creases fell out when I put them up.The light is very nicely filtered through these and it isn't a harsh brightness, at night, the oldfashioned street lamps on my street filter through these curtains and turn to a sleepy amber, it is just so cozy, even with my cool blue colored drapes. I can't wait to see the lights reflect off the snow in winter.In every way these have turned out perfect and any worries I had that they would be too tan or beige or that the light that came in would be sorta dirty yellow colored have fallen away. I don't think I could find nicer curtains.My only complaint, and really this is more of a failing on my parts is that we bought a curtain rod that feels kinda textured, like it was sprayed with a texturizing paint and so this texture plus this fabric, which has a linen/homespun feel to it, made it a bit more challenging to slide onto the curtain rod. It was a bit slow going, but as you can see from my photo, it turned out fine and I plan to use curtain hooks instead of sliding the curtain back each day.",
