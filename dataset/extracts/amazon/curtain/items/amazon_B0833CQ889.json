I needed curtains that would block my neighbors from seeing inside my house, so I more than doubled the curtain panels. The extra panels give me more privacy. I used eight total-two to a pack. I like that fact that they're polyester and will last through washings. They don't look like poly- more linen like. The curtains have a nice weight to them and they flow nicely with movement. If your second guessing whether or not to make this purchase, don't. They look fantastic. Happy customer!",
