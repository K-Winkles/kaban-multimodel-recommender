The fabric is as soft as silk. They are very weighted, not just some flimsy fabric. The black panel on the back keeps light and heat out while the white front keeps my room from being too dark. The white I chose is a beautiful, pure white, not too bright but perfect. I used my hand steamer to press the wrinkles out and I was good to go. I am so pleased with these panels. I will probably be ordering more for other rooms. \u2728",
