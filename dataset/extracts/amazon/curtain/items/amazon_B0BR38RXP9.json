Consistent color on all 4 panels. I have 9ft ceiling & ordered 108\u201d curtains, mounted rod 1\u201d below ceiling & have curtains pile 1\u201d.Surprisingly hardly any wrinkles. Since they\u2019re polyester & have the blackout on them, cannot tumble dry; need cool iron to press. Luckily they don\u2019t need ironing & I don\u2019t own an iron so no prob. Ea panel is 3lbs so I assume the heavier weight helps to release most wrinkles.They\u2019re a very good quality set of curtains. Well stitched, nice material, good consistent color, nice lighter color backing.I\u2019m pleasantly surprised & highly recommend.",

It is mostly unnoticeable at night but during the day your curtains will look like if they have lots of holes. I ended up having to go to a craft store and bought a iron on black fabric for patching. It\u2019s a shame that something like that was overlooked. One of the panels is fine so I believe it is a quality control issue. Unfortunately I could not return because I could not wait since it was going to be used at a guest bedroom and I had guests coming. I would definitely not recommend this product.",
