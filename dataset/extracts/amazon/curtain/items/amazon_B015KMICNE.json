                "reviewText": "Rating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 (5/5)I recently purchased the NICETOWN Black Out Curtain, and I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the results! Living in a bustling area, the lights from the street often permeated into my living room, causing a glaring disturbance, especially during the evening hours. This curtain, measuring a generous 52 inches wide by 54 inches long, has provided the perfect solution.Design and Aesthetic (5/5):The design is both functional and stylish. The solid color and sleek look of the curtain seamlessly blend with various decor styles, adding a touch of elegance to my living room. The grommet design made installation a breeze, effortlessly sliding on my existing curtain rod.Light Blocking Capability (5/5):The NICETOWN Black Out Curtain lives up to its name, providing exceptional blackout capabilities. It effectively blocks out almost all the incoming light, turning my living room into a calm and dim space, ideal for movie nights or just relaxation without the blare of streetlights.Thermal Insulation (5/5):Beyond its light-blocking functionality, this curtain also offers remarkable thermal insulation. It has helped to moderate the temperature in my room, keeping it cool during the hot days and retaining warmth during the colder nights. This thermal efficiency is not just comfortable but also contributes to energy savings by reducing the need for excessive heating or cooling.Ease of Care (5/5):Maintenance is hassle-free. The curtain is designed for easy care, and I have had no issues with cleaning. It retains its color, texture, and insulating properties even after a few washes, making it a practical and durable choice for any room.In conclusion, the NICETOWN Black Out Curtain has transformed my living space into a more comfortable, aesthetically pleasing, and energy-efficient environment. It is a valuable addition, delivering beyond expectations, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their living or bedroom spaces!",

                "reviewText": "I read so many reviews for these and finally decided to go for it after some comparison shopping. THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! They are INCREDIBLY soft with a satin like finish, and block out all light!! I live downtown so I get a lot of city lights from the street lamps and nearby businesses that stream into my LARGE 72\u201d wide bedroom window at night. I need complete darkness to sleep and these did not disappoint!! I got two 80\u201dW curtains in black (to match with the rest of the decor in my apartment) and am absolutely in love with them. Not only do they look amazing, high quality and are soft material, they also block out ALL light. When they said blackout, they absolutely meant it! The only light that gets through these is a tiny sliver from the very top since the curtain doesn\u2019t touch the ceiling like my window does but that has nothing to do with the quality of the curtains and more about where I placed the curtain rod. My room at night at ABSOLUTELY BLACK. No light gets in through these and I love it! During the day, if I close the curtains the room is ALSO ABSOLUTELY BLACK! I can sleep just as well as if it was the middle of the night! I also have a dog with long fur that seems to love the feel of the fabric because she\u2019s taken to rubbing against them occasionally and the fabric is so soft that her fur (which usually sticks to everything) brushes off with a simple swipe of my hand. I recommend these to anyone looking for black out curtains and I\u2019m considering buying another set for my living room windows and balcony door. I\u2019ve read reviews complaining about the wrinkles and figured if they were REALLY badly wrinkled I could pull out my steamer and iron them out, but I haven\u2019t had any issues. They had a few fold lines here and there from being very neatly folded in the packaging (not compressed!) but I\u2019ve had them hanging for about 4 days and most of the wrinkles have already disappeared. They\u2019re also surprisingly light weight for blackout curtains. All in all I am extremely pleased with my purchase and will be ordering these again if I need another set in the future!",

My family has a tendency to just shove the vertical blinds to the side without opening them and they were breaking and more light was coming through then I liked. These curtains allowed me to push the blinds to the side and still have privacy and easy of entry.Down side limited color options. We live in Minnesota and it's starting to get cold here and my husband has said that he has noticed a reduction in the drafts with them too since his desk is by that door.My mother even had me order them for her 2x 1 for her living room and again for her bedroom.",
