Every morning it's like Gandalf said the magic word and the door to the Mines of Moria has lit up. I wouldn't have ordered them if I'd known this, but now that they're up I actually really like them. My living room is pretty busy and they fit in with that. Fabric feels on the cheap side, but visually it looks nice. Barely any wrinkles out of the bag. They block outside light extremely well. I'm going to say they block cold well too, but I should've bought longer panels to reach the floor to really judge this though. Sitting near them on a frigid day I can say I'm comfortable. If you think this is what you're looking for, I think you'll be happy.",

They are just right, no wrinkles, hang well and overlap just enough when closed. Good fabric and seem well-made. We just push to the side to open, by hand. Note - on the sheerness rating I gave them one star, because they are not sheer at all. The rating should have been for darkness - 5 stars for that. Very happy with these - paid what I wanted and very satisfied.",

I like that I can pull back the curtains and let the sunlight in during the day. Prior to that, I had a giant blanket up in the window to cover it so I could get some sleep. The curtain material is sturdy and pretty also.",

The areas without stars block the light completely which is great. I'm very pleased with these curtains overall and definitely recommend them. The stars are a great little touch for my kid's space themed bedroom.",
