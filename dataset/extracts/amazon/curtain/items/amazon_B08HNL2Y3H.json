Mine is in my closet so I\u2019m not concerned. It might be possible that if you hang it gathered, this could be easilycovered in the ruffles. * There is a top pocket like most rod pocket curtains that could fit a standard rod. Otherwise, there\u2019s a larger pocket for the wide rods. But if you need to gather it on a traditional rod, you have no header/top ruffle.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered five sets of the two-panel curtains because I have 10 Windows going down the side of my house. I'm on a budget so buying two panels helped cut down the cost. I'm pretty sure I got the measurements right but they were a bit short on length and width. Unfortunately, only two sets were delivered and I was informed after the fact that the other three sets were on backorder and they were unable to provide a delivery date. Because of this, I had to cancel the other three sets and have to return the other two sets. However, I feel I shouldn't have to return the other two sets since the mishap was on their part and I no longer need them and I don't think I should have to go through all of the fuss of returning them. Especially since I do not have a vehicle and I am unable to get to a UPS Store unless I find a ride which is not easy to do if I were to have them come pick it up I would be charged an additional $8 which I cannot afford. I needed the curtains ASAP. Overall not happy with the purchase.",
