Since I suffer from migraines, I was on the look out for some good curtains to dim the daily brightness. These work great! The neutral color looks great under my sheer curtains and from the outside of the house. They're very darkening, almost black out but not quite there, which is perfect for me. Plus, they were at a great price! I definitely recommend them",
