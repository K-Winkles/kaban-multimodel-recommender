I did notice that they were actually one inch longer when I hung them up then the drapes that they hang next to, both are labeled as supposed to be the same length. I didn't bother to get out the tape measure to find out which one was more accurate but just FYI.If I had thought about this, I would have gotten the soft white or ivory instead of the pure white because it has a slightly cool cast to the pure white, but that seems reasonable in hindsight, I just didn't think of it ahead.",

                "reviewText": "I got these when I was replacing my vertical blinds for my back patio. I got a double curtain rod so that I could have standard curtains, but I also wanted at least a slight barrier for when I wanted light but I didn't want people being able to look in.These curtains have done exactly what I wanted them to. They let in the perfect amount of light while also preventing people from looking straight into my house. You get two in a pack, so you get an incredible value for your money. I also love the grommets at the top which easily move along the rod for when I want to either go out my backdoor or just want to look into my yard without anything in the way. The only downside is that the curtains came super wrinkled, and I tried to steam them, but that did almost nothing to make them less wrinkled looking. However, after about a week, the curtains seemed to settle on their own. Overall, I am incredibly happy with these and would highly recommend them.",
