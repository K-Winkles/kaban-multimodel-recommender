These are well made and they allow natural light to flow through. They are not so thin that a pet can tear them in a single swat! I\u2019d buy more of these for other rooms. They are quite attractive.",

We painted it a sage green and needed to replace the curtains on the two large windows in this room. We were looking for something that \"felt\" like it fit the room. The green walls with the large wood table, made the room feel like it was primed for a nice spring breeze to blow through. When we saw these curtains with the patterns sewn into them that resembled leaves, we knew they'd be perfect. And they are. They are unique and look really great.",
