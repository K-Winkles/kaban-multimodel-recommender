Classic and elegant curtain rods will be better. Do these curtains block the sunlight well? This curtain can block 85%-99% of sunlight, and deep colors work better. Are the curtains easy to care for? Are they durable? If only you do not want to change your home decoration, our curtains are durable enough for long-time use. Machine wash is available, just do not bleach or iron them in high temperature. Can the curtains be used outdoor? You can use the curtains outdoors in sunny weather, but if they get wet from rain, to avoid mold, it is best to dry them before reusing them. What size is each panel? Is the size 52 inches wide for each panel or both added together? Each panel measures 37/52 inches, and the width of the two panels combined is 74/104 inches. Only 100 width is single panel, and 70 width single panel will be coming soon.",

Look a the color chart to be sure you're choosing a color with the amount of light-blocking you wish. They hang nicely and are very smooth. They are polyester, so they do feel sythetic, not at all fancy. They are also a bit static-y for that reason. They aren't the type of fabric that feels like crushed velvet or like cotton. It feels, looks, and atcs like polyester, so just be sure that's what you want!",
