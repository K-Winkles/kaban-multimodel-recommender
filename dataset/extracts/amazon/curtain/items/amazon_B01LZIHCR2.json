                "reviewText": "After Hurricane Ian tore the carport off my trailer, the living room and kitchen became unbearable from the heat created by the sun coming through the windows. I began a long search for white insulated curtains. I am very careful how I spend my income. I want things that will last and will not be toxic. So many of the insulated curtains were reported to have a strong chemical smell and the folds in the fabric could not be removed. Finally, I found a good review and I am going to add to that good review to help to have your search end hereTurquoize insulated thermal curtains are made from the loveliest fabric I have come across in ages. I am a seamstress and know fabric. It is soft and smooth and drapes beautifully. No smell, no ever-lasting folds to worry about. This is REAL QUALITY at a very affordable price. They arrived on time, carefully packaged with no smell when taken out of package. I placed them on the back of my long couch to display to the many neighbors who also lost a carport to see for themselves what a bargain these curtain are. They are skillfully sewn, No puckers or raveling. One curtain matches exactly to the other curtain when hanging. This company appears to have excellent quality control. Several friends bought these curtains after seeing mine. Now after one year, we had hurricane Idalia and my curtains stood up to it.The curtains reduce heat from the sun at peak hours by 50% and up to 100% at other hours.It must be noted, to be fair, that since the hurricane the windows no long shut tight and that adds to the heat.You would not expect elegance from insulated curtains but these really are simple elegance. I love them and feel trust in this manufacturer. I hope this review has helped you reach a decision,",

However they are well sewn in and look fine. I had looked at Target online and reviews weren't stellar so went to Amazon and bought these. They were priced right, had the features I wanted with lots of color choices, and are machine washable. I only intend to use in the colder months. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.",

Unfortunately, these are regular curtains and do NOT significantly nor completely block out the light.I am disappointed because I needed blackout, am on a deadline, and have purchased other Turquoize products that are as advertised.",

It didn't take long to iron the panels, but they needed more than the recommended low heat, they can definitely take medium heat. I really like the back tab style, classier than grommets. Very happy with this purchase.",
