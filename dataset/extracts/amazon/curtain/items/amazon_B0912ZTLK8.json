If you want true blackout, these are not it, but the look very pretty and work for me. The fabric is a medium weight and thickness of polyester and has a nice feel to it, almost like a heavy sateen sheet. The tie-backs with the Velcro work well as you can see from the photo. The panels look classy and I'm pleased with them. The price wasn't bad in the first place and after seeing them up, I think it was totally worth it. We hung these with the flat sash rods which are a bit more expensive but they look much nicer than the ones that stick out.",

This label was sewing into the seam so when I remove it, a hole appeared, but that was one panel, the other is just fine. These are thick fabric, but compared to my other blackouts, these are not as thick or have extra material to be true blackout, but I got the color gray and since these are a bit wider than my French doors, I can bunch up the fabric to really get a blackout effect. I am using these on my study door for privacy and for my purpose, these work great and they look awesome. If I was going to use these on a front door, I would recommend using two panels to get a true blackout.",

My windows are 27 inches wide so I bought the 50 plus inch curtains to have the \u201cbunching\u201d effect\u201d I sourced little rods on Amazon, and pulled them relatively snug to secure the bottom so I didn\u2019t have slack. I did use a handheld steamer for about 5 minutes on a couple of creases, but they weren\u2019t bad and may have come out on their own. I\u2019m curious to see how these wash, but I\u2019m very happy with this purchase. Installing takes about 10 minutes or less and is easy.",

Lol! My entryway door window of my new home is super big so this one panel fits the width fine but does not entirely cover the length of it but that works well for me as the material is opaque and does not allow any light in so having them shorter than the window allowed me to hang them so that some daylight to come into the foyer from the top. I would not want the panel to be any longer, at least for my current purposes. I had bought a set of short curtains of this same brand for my normal sized & much smaller condo entryway door window in 2020 and I loved them there so much that I hoped I\u2019d get the same thick material for my new place. And I did! (Some people reported getting a thin material.) They feel luxurious and are supposed to be washable but I don\u2019t plan on washing them any time soon and if by some strange reason they get something on them, I will probably just spot clean them as I would be too worried about ruining that crisp feel they currently have.",
