I had shopped for drapes for a good month before purchasing these. I\u2019m so glad I waited. I was looking at Half Price Drapes in the birch color. They have almost a cult following for that color due to social media influences. Actually, that made me go in a different direction. $80 for their one panel was just annoying. Still, I\u2019m picky pickerson. It\u2019s frustrating when I see reviews that don\u2019t tell me the color of the curtain panel they chose. I got 8 panels of the gray 96 inchers. I fully expected the lines would not match up when I closed the two panels on the windows. Amazingly, they matched up perfectly on all the panels. That says some thing about the quality. The workmanship is admirable. The loose threads some are complaining about, in my opinion, just means that there are loose threads in the factory. Remember home ec sewing? Like that. None of the loose threads were attached to the panel on mine. I could just shake them off. I steamed every inch of these panels and it seemed like a miracle to me that I found no flaws. That is too rare these days. These drape beautifully and they are heavy. It makes me want to shake them in slow motion. The first couple panels had minimal wrinkles. The rest were moderate. I hung these up straight out of the packages and started steaming. I spent no more than five minutes on any single panel. The wrinkles melted. I did purchase the Ticwell 1500 hand steamer. The one I got worked like a charm. The wrinkles melted in front of my eyes on a single pass.The color of the gray panel is almost identical to Quaker Oats raw. The gray stripe is a medium gray.I\u2019ll be buying more curtains from this company. The quality is amazing.I hope this helps somebody else that is curtain panel obsessing like I was.",

I needed a neutral colored and light blocking drape that looked nice. These fit that bill. They come in a few different shades and are fully lined. They are not total are plenty of black out for watching TV. Somehow I seem have totally mismeasured the dining room so I had to purchase rings with clips to make them longer. (I could have let down the hem but I wanted a nice looking easier option. I hope I don't have the same issue in living room because it is way too late to return. Overall, I am deliriously happy with the color, print, light block and quality. I haven't washed so I can't comment on that. I will revisit this review, if I can, when it comes time to wash.",
