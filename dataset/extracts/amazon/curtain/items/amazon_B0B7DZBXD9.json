They completely block the light coming from outside; the back panel is white, so it reflects light rather than absorbing (like some of the other curtains with black panels do). The interior color (natural) is also very pretty. Obviously it has some wrinkles because it had to be folded when shipped, but those will even themselves out under gravity (or if you iron them).",

Well this purchase was NOT regretted! These curtains are amazing in quality and looks! Room darkening for sure! Just the way my husband like it. But at the same time they are very soft to the eye and touch. The pictures dont over sell them thats for sure!",
