So I ordered 2nd set and they're amazing. (I have 2 smaller windows on each side of my bay window, making it wider than average bay window) Length was perfect. No need to iron. They hang perfectly straight from package. They look so elegant. They filter light, without being blackout curtains. At night with lights on inside you can see the lights through curtains, but nothing else, offering a lot more privacy than I thought they would. The texture is subtle and beautiful also. One of the best purchases ever.",
