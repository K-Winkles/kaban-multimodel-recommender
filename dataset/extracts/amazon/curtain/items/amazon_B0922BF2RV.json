                "reviewText": "These panels were purchased to shield the street light from the eyes of guests spending the night in my front bedroom which is in direct line with said street light. These panels met my expectations in every way from quality of the fabric and workmanship to the lovely way they drape as well as to the choice of colors available and light filtering ability which stopped just short of being blackout. Currently two panels of different colors are hanging at that bedroom window awaiting my decision on which will look best with the new bedspread. It is going to be a hard choice. I am going to put some sheers underneath to be able to open the panels during the day and still maintain some privacy. I don't think you can go wrong with these draperies.",

Our old sheers didn't smell this badly.FYI~we do not own a dog, nor do any visit our home.This odor wafted through the house from room to room (not always present in any given place) and baffled us. We checked our carpet, our HVAC units, etc., until we realized it was coming from these sheers.Well, I washed the two sets of sheers in our bedroom and the odor has disappeared from that one room. Now, I shall wash all remaining 13 pairs of sheers to ensure our home no longer smells like \"wet dog\". I really should have gone with my hard and fast rule \"wash everything before using\", but they didn't smell awful right out of the package...it seems that they bloom this terrible odor when the sun hits them.Live and learn.They really are nice sheers, though!",
