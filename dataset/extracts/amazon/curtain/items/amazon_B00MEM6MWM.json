The design is a nice pattern, the fabric is medium thickness they allow light in, but I put a plain sheer in the middle, to allow more light in when I want! I bought length 84' grayish & reddish brown set! Great looking curtains! Would recommend to family and friends!",

For this price I could go elsewhere and get two lined panels for the same price.Who hangs only one panel?! \ud83e\udd14Anyway, it is a gorgeous design and beautiful fabric, almost like linen. At night it is a very rich colour.Unfortunately, during the day with the sun shining through the window, it becomes somewhat transparent and cheap looking. Lining would make all the difference!If the price comes down, I will purchase more of this design and add the lining myself.",
