Variety of hanging options, including back tabs which is how I chose to hang them. I got the dark grey color and it is a nice, rich color. Pictures show in various lighting. Had to order a couple different colors before I settled with these. As another review said, I got the cream, but it came off as more of a butter yellow color than an off-white. Wasn\u2019t planning on doing dark grey, but they look great! Still need to steam out wrinkles. Would recommend these.",

So soft, basically black-out without the ugly liner, and even though I was expecting to need to steam any curtains I hung, they came out of the package wrinkle-free. All I had to do was hang them up. Incredible quality at a phenomenal price point. I want more for the rest of my house now!",
