They are VISUALLY sheer, and beautiful to look at, but after one night of them around my tester bed I decided to hang lace instead, because these don't let in much air. I'll probably hang these over the lace curtains on my bedroom WINDOWS, or maybe behind the lace? But their air-blocking properties should be useful in more extreme weather, maybe not as good as the thick, plain ones I'm using now, but summer. I need leaf shapes, even leaf shadows, for mental health! ;-)",

                "reviewText": "I got the bright white toile sheer curtains with the gold glitter embedded vines in a few different lengths for different windows in my house. To be tasteful, it must be used sparingly, and so in between each set of vine panels, a set of pure white toile sheer curtains was used in order to keep from going overboard. They\u2019re absolutely gorgeous (and the gold can twinkle at night) but if used in every window of your house, it could look very tchotchke-like or theme-based, which is not what you want your home decor to display. The greens used varied from a light spring or rosemary green to a slightly darker forest color, but in general, these are very light colored vines with realistic hues. Due to the fact that the vines are printed onto the toile, and they are embedded with glitter, please remember that you cannot put these in the wash or dryer at all. Overall, an excellent product, and this specific brand is definitely the best quality of vine curtains found on Amazon.",
