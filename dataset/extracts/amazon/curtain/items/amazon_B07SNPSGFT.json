                "reviewText": "This is one of my best purchases and actually my second order of these. I ordered the first one awhile back and wanted to see how it looked and review the quality. I was so pleased I ordered the same one for my other door. I had looked at several different panels for doors and most of them looked horrible and cheap. Although these ones were not expensive at all, the quality is very good. I was worried that I wouldn't like the ruffling, at top and bottom but turns out it is so minor and lays very flat. I was also worried about wrinkling as I saw many online that when not tied, looked horrible. These are not sheer material but by no means super thick. Its complete blackout, can't see through them at all. I got the gray ones as my house is gray trimmed throughout and the color is a very nice medium dark gray. It comes with a velcro strap to tie it in the middle as shown in the pictures and it looks great. I tie them every day and untie at night and it doesn't cause any wrinkles. Very surprising. Since these are french doors, I bought the two curtain rods seperately but they only cost about $6 and are very easy to screw into the door. I did not choose the stick on kind as I didn't trust they wouldn't fall. But, these are very lightweight curtains so you might be fine with stick on ones. I really love these curtains. By far, better than the others you see online.",

These are definitely really good if you\u2019re trying to also block out sunlight or daylight in a bedroom, I will say that it is quite difficult to get into the inserts for the rods. Maybe it\u2019s what I have at home, but other than that they look really good. It\u2019s really thick material as well and not super thin. I would definitely say it\u2019s worth the money and it\u2019s a really fair price for what you\u2019re getting. Buy them!!",

I was concerned esp. because I got white. I went outside to see if you could see through them during day time & at night time with lights on in house & off. I also tried outside light on & off at night. They are definitely not see through in any of these situations. Delivery took 4 days. The price was $23.85 tax included Canada.
