I did have to iron the wrinkles out of them, but I\u2019m that\u2019s just a personal necessity. I have. It had any issues with wrinkles since then, though. They were very easy to hang as they just slide right on the curtain rod. I bought another set because I love them so much. Highly recommend. They\u2019re a great value!",

                "reviewText": "These curtains are exactly what I was looking for and I couldn't be happier with them. But firstly, I want to make clear that I didn't get these at a discount in exchange for an honest review, like I have previous products. I bought these at full price and am just so in love with them that I wanted to share my experience and photos. These are actually the second set of curtains I bought for this particular set of sliding glass doors in my bedroom. The first set were from Best Home Fashion, but not only was I sent the wrong color (a grey instead of the bright green), I really didn't like the quality and look of them when I took them out of the bag. They didn't seem to be black out curtains and the grommet was already rusting and discoloring the fabric near it :/ So I returned those and found these and I love them!The first photo is the closest to the actual color (Horizon Blue), and as you can see there's no light coming through whatsoever. Admittedly there is a covered patio outside my door, so there's no direct sunlight on the glass, but in the other two photos you can see that there's enough light coming in that these curtains do do a spectacular job at blocking it entirely. (please ignore the dirty carpet outside, we just bought this house and haven't changed it yet lol). Currently I have the curtains hanging on what was once a valance rod using shower curtain hooks, but I didn't have enough hooks so the drape is wonky because I had to skip a few holes. Even still, the bottom edges line up pretty much perfectly, as you can see in the fourth photo. The texture of the fabric is pretty silky and smooth, but heavy and thick unlike actual silk curtains.When it comes to negatives, right out of the package these curtains do have quite a lot of creases and lines in them, as you can clearly see in the photos. I plan to let them hang for a few days in the hopes gravity will take care of them, otherwise I might try ironing or using the steam setting on the washing machine to remove them. But if for some reason the creases don't come out even after using these methods, I will update my review accordingly. The only other negative which is actually more of a disappointment, is that they don't come with matching ties that you attach to the wall and use to hold the curtains back. I honestly don't know if it's standard for long curtains to come with ties, but my old window curtains (Best Home Fashion) did and I had just assumed these would too. It's really not that big of a deal, but it would have been a nice extra if they came with them.",
