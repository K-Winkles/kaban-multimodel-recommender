                "reviewText": "These seem to be very good quality. They are thick and semi soft. They completely block out all the light, which is what I wanted for a hot or warm day. I love the ties. They are so beautiful and a nice accent. My only complaint is the pink color is darker and the white seems to be more of a grey than what is shown in the picture.",
