Looked like someone with a dirty boot stepped right on them!Good things: they're beautiful! Such a perfect accent for our house. Very easy to clean! We have a black cat and I've yet to notice fur sticking to these as badly as I was expecting. We have a 9 ft wide window and these 2 panels covered it perfectly! They're obviously light filtering (white is always see through), so we bought a couple of blackout curtains to make the room darker a bit. These here though, the temperature in the house is so much cooler since we put them up! 100% worth it!! The sheer panels are attached at the top which allows us to pull back the white panels and have the sheer covering the windows. We just need to get tiebacks lol.",

I like that they offer complete privacy but also still let in natural light. They are a bit wrinkly but that appears just from being folded for delivery. Im going to steam them out.",

However, you will definitely need to take the time to iron both the tulle and white underlay. I tried to hang them without ironing first and they looked like a tacky, crumpled tutu on my wall. Once ironed, they looked expensive and elegant. I hung mine from curtain rings and I took out the hems to add about 5 inches in length. The hem prevented them from softly puddling on the floor. Definitely not blackout curtains but I did not want blackout so that was a bonus for me.",
