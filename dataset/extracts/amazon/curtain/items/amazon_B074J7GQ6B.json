These curtains - I purchased them in black - block all the light. I am so pleased! They also are made of a very thick, soft, luxurious fabric. The price was unbeatable for the quality solution I now have. There are two panels in one package, so normally that would be for one window. I actually used one panel on each of two windows, beneath a lovely set of white curtains that are always closed anyway, and they work fine this way for my needs. Of course, where the curtains are NOT, such as above the windows (above the rod), yes, the light still gets in, but that has nothing to do with the curtains themselves. They are doing their job!",
