        "description": "Add a touch of spring and brighten up your bedroom, living room, dining room, or home office decor with the Weeping Flower Room Darkening Window Curtain Panel Set. These curtains are printed with a graceful floral design, showcasing colorful flowers cascading down a vine from the top of the window panel. The combination of the beautiful bright colors and the natural setting of the design is engaging to all your senses. It's an enjoyable and charming modern piece that also delivers room darkening efficiency. These panels will add sophistication to your home while helping to filter sunlight, provide privacy, reduce outside noise, and regulate the temperature in the room. They significantly darken a room, but still allow some light to fill your space, creating a serene atmosphere and making them an energy efficient option for your home. A win-win for any room in the home. Each panel measures 52 inches wide and since this style is sold by the pair, you will get 104 total inches of width per order. They also have an extra two inch header at the top for a finished look. Fashion meets function with this set. Having a three-inch rod pocket gives you two options for hanging this curtain set. You can either slide the panel right onto the curtain rod or hang the panels by clip rings. For your convenience, these window panels are safe to machine wash on gentle cycle and to tumble dry on low. Please refer to the care label for full instructions.",

They are room darkening but not too dark, which is what I was going for when the curtains are closed during the Spring/Summer season. The material is soft and smooth too the touch, love that. One panel of a set did have a small spot on it, but u hung those up behind my soft so you can't see it. Very nice curtains.",

I would say they let a medium amount of light in, so not too sheer and not light blocking, which is exactly what I wanted. I have noticed our living room is warmer since putting these over the windows, as they are pretty thick. We added the round curtain clips to make them easier to slide open.",
