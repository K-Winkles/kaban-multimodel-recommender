                "reviewText": "Bought these for the family/movie room. They looked great right out of the package, and block light well during the day for movie night in the summer evenings. They also afford unlimited privacy as they are not sheer. I bought others at a local brick and mortar and returned them, as they were sleeved (which makes it more difficult to open and close) and they were not light blocking. They were also the same price. We returned them and bought these. The ring design, vs. sleeve is very nice, and the rings are bronze colored and solid, not the cheap aluminum/tin silver rings on most. They slide across the 1 inch curtain rod with ease. The drapes are heavy though, and I had to reinforce the curtain rod with a middle brace to hold them up. I highly recommend these curtains.",

                "reviewText": "I bought white curtains and am very pleased. I read on several of the reviews that the hem was uneven or longer on one panel. My curtains are exactly perfect, with each panel matching at the hem, good quality. They were however, very wrinkled from shipping. I tried a wet towel in the dryer with them and even washed them and hung up wet on the rod...didn't work. They had to be steamed ironed on both sides to look perfectly wonderful.I was disappointed in the grommets. The description said\" semi dull silver grommets\", which are what I had, but when it came, the grommets are actually more copper than silver and isn't a perfect match to any rods I can find. I opted to use my silver and not worry about it.",

                "reviewText": "I needed new curtains for our sliding deck door. I bought several sets of curtains before I found these ones and was happy! I wanted the linen look, but not sheer. I also didn\u2019t want them to feel super thick and heavy. These curtains literally checked all the boxes! They filter the light really well - I\u2019d say they\u2019re not 100% blackout, but that\u2019s what I preferred for my space. The color is great and goes well with the rest of my decor. It\u2019s a nice charcoal grey color - just perfection! The backing is not a thick, plastic-y type of backing like others I\u2019ve have before. It\u2019s a nice soft material. And I like that it\u2019s white so the curtain color won\u2019t fade with all the sunlight beaming on them everyday (I\u2019ve had this issue before).I posted several pictures. One at night time with our light on to show the color, and the others during day to show the light filtering and color. I\u2019m super happy with this purchase! If you\u2019re on the fence, buy the curtains!",

Product is wrinkled out of the package so place in dryer two panels at a time with a wet towel on med high heat for 10 mins before handing. Blue color is just as pictured. These are fully lined with traditional heavy white liner and this sets the product apart from most of the other options available on Amazon in this category. Light blocking is excellent.
