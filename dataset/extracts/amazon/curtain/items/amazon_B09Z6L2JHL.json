A lot of curtains I\u2019ve tried feel so bulky and bunch up so thick - these do not! They feel so light and flowy.Although the material is definitely not 100% linen (70 polyester/30 cotton, I believe) they look like linen and don\u2019t feel plasticy or rough.They did come a bit wrinkled but after hanging them they are starting to even out. I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t be too hard to steam/iron them.The colors are beautiful (white/gray) and it gives the perfect amount of coverage while also allowing a good amount of natural light in. The price is unbeatable and you get 2 panels in a pack which is even better.Can\u2019t recommend these enough!",

The embroidery on the side is beautiful and adds a great touch to the curtains. I choose the 84in length and it was the perfect size.They do not cover all the light out but they cover enough for me that I love them. If you are looking for a very thick curtain I wouldn\u2019t recommend this one but if you\u2019re looking for an in-between this is the perfect one. They have a very zen boho feel and look to them . They definitely are well made.One of my biggest concerns was getting curtains with a cheap look or feel to them, these will not disappoint. They look sophisticated. Definitely recommend!!!!!",

They are the perfect level of sheerness for my living room - not see through but not blackout and they look very lightweight and fashionable. The embroidery is also beautiful. My only complaint is that craftmanship is not consistent. On some of the curtains, the embroidery is perfect, on others the lines are wobbly. The length of the curtains also varies. I ordered all 3 pairs in the same size but one pair is longer than the others. Because of the way I hung these curtains initially, the discrepancies were not noticeable. By the time I finally noticed the quality issue, it was too late to return or replace them. I would still recommend them with the caveat to make sure you inspect them for any quality issues as soon as you get them (don't be like me).",
