Works well at keeping out the cold air and it easily darkens the room. The back fabric is the same as the front so I'm sure it looks perfect from the outside. The material feels wonderful. Isn't cheap looking.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Thermal Insulated Portable Grommet Blackout Curtains, and I must say they've been quite a pleasant addition to my home. These curtains effectively serve their purpose, and I'd like to share my thoughts in this review.Effective Light Blocking (4/5): The primary reason for investing in blackout curtains is to block out unwanted light, and these curtains do a commendable job. They effectively darken the room, creating a cozy and comfortable atmosphere, especially during daytime naps or when you want to create a cinematic experience in your home. However, I did notice a slight amount of light seeping through the sides of the curtains, which is why I'm giving them four stars instead of five.Thermal Insulation (4/5): The thermal insulation properties of these curtains are impressive. They help regulate the room temperature, keeping it cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. This not only enhances comfort but can also contribute to energy savings. However, it's essential to note that they are not a complete substitute for proper insulation, so don't expect miraculous changes in your energy bills.Portable and Easy to Install (5/5): The portability of these curtains is a standout feature. They are incredibly easy to install and move around, making them a versatile solution for different spaces or if you frequently change your room layout. The grommet design ensures a hassle-free setup without the need for additional hardware.Material and Durability (4/5): The material used in these curtains is of decent quality. They feel soft to the touch and appear well-made. However, I would have appreciated a bit more thickness in the fabric to enhance light-blocking capabilities further. With regular use, I expect these curtains to hold up well over time.Stylish Design (4/5): These blackout curtains come in a variety of colors and styles, allowing you to choose a design that complements your decor. They add a touch of elegance to the room, and I appreciate the attention to detail in their aesthetic.In conclusion, the Thermal Insulated Portable Grommet Blackout Curtains offer effective light blocking and thermal insulation, making them a valuable addition to any room. Their portability and ease of installation are definite advantages. While there is a slight issue with light leakage and fabric thickness, these curtains serve their purpose well and enhance the comfort and ambiance of your space. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a practical and stylish solution to control light and temperature in their home.",

You can actually see the holes in the material.Obviously there was not even a miniscule difference to the sound of the road outside.They are great blackout curtains but noise reducing? I literally feel like I was conned and these sound reducing curtains are as real as a bucket of air.I will be sending them back, absolute waste of money and time having to return them.I bought a different pair of curtains on sale purely for the colour, they arrived 5 times thicker than these crappy triple woven curtains and I am now sleeping in my living room as they actually do muffle the noise.DO NOT BUY FOR SOUND ABSORPTION/NOISE REDUCING - A LOAD OF OLD TOSH.",
