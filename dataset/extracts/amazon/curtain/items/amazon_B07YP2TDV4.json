                "reviewText": "Just moved. I got the front bedroom. Big, low window. Felt like I was on display. Black out shades. If the shade is down it's pitch black. If the shade is up I'm less than 20' from the front sidewalk. Neighbors couldn't help but notice me and wave. Far more attention than I needed 7 am. This single panel is PERFECT as a sheer. I can leave the shade up in the day and not feel like I'm in a store window. No one can see in unless the light is on at night. I used two regular 3 pound Command hooks and an inexpensive little adjustable cafe rod to hang it. The medallions/pattern in the lace show up very well from the street. Off-white, scalloped on 3 sides with a generous rod casing. I needed more length so I re-did the casing end with a smaller casing. Super easy to do. It's pretty! Really working perfectly for me.",
