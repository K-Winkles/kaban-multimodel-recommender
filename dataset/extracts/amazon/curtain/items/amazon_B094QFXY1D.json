                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Very attractive, lightweight, insulated blackout curtains with grommets",
                "reviewText": "I purchased two sets of the 42\" x 54\" insulated blackout curtains with grommets in teal for my master bedroom. The curtain fabric is very smooth, soft, and lightweight and consists of two identical sheets of fabric joined and interlaid with the insulating blackout layer of material. I really like it that the curtains are more flexible than heavier insulated drapes with a rubberized backing that is unattractive. These drapes are the same color on both sides and do a wonderful job blocking sunlight and the summer heat. Our bedroom windows face south and west; therefore, we get the brunt of the afternoon sun and heat on that part of the house. Since my husband has to get up at 3 a.m. to go to work, that means he goes to bed well before the sun sets during the summer months. He is especially pleased with the effectiveness of these curtains blocking the bright sunlight. Oh, and since the curtain material has a satin like feel, and I chose curtains with grommets, I don't have issues with the curtains separating and letting in that blinding knife of sunlight that feels worse than a fully exposed window. It feels as if the curtains do cut down on the heat in the room, but I'll have a better idea in a month or so as far as utility bills go. I also really like this shade of teal. Teal is a cool tone and is naturally soothing, and this particular shade of teal easily matches and compliments the bedroom decor. I gave four stars regarding the wrinkle-free rating. Since the curtains arrive folded in their package they are naturally going to have creases from the folding process that need to be worked out gently. Before I hung the curtains I put them in the dryer with ice cubes on a low setting and was able to tumble out some of the wrinkles. While they are not completely gone yet, I noticed today that the fold marks have dissipated. As of this writing I have had the curtains for six days. At any rate, I suspect that if I lightly misted the curtains with distilled water that the remaining fold marks would disappear as the curtains dried while hanging in the window. I expect I will be able to upgrade that rating soon. I really like these curtains for their aesthetics as well as their ability to block heat and light from the windows. These curtains were listed as blackout and insulated curtains, and they fulfill both. I've read other reviews and even the vendor's advisories that choosing darker colored curtains will provide more of the blackout effect, whereas the lighter colored curtains will only darken the room. Do keep that in mind. The price of these curtains is certainly very reasonable. I am very happy with these curtains and do recommend this brand and style to others.#EDIT# 06/21/2023: I do want to make an edit to give you a heads up about a different set of curtains I bought from this seller a few days later. I ordered three sets of turquoise thermal blackout curtains with grommets for my oversized living room window. According to the color key on the seller's listing, their turquoise is a deep, dark, bright blue-green. It provides a pop of color I wanted to compliment the furniture and room decorations. When I received the package, although the labels stated they were turquoise, the curtains I received were a beautiful pale blue-green, almost a pale mint. Actually, these curtains are identified in the seller's color palette as aqua. Lovely as they looked in the package, I had my heart set on the actual turquoise curtains. I notified Amazon of the issue, and I received a replacement order two days later, and I was to take the first shipment to the UPS Store to return them. I waited until I received the replacement order because I suspected it would be identical to the first. It was. I took them to the local UPS Store to be returned to the seller and will be refunded once the package is received by the seller. The seller and Amazon worked quickly to expedite the replacement order, and I appreciate that greatly. I don't know if color batches are being mislabeled or if perhaps the dark blue-green (turquoise) curtains have been discontinued and the curtains previously labeled as aqua were intentionally changed to turquoise. I'm just letting you know what I received twice when I ordered turquoise versus what the picture presented in case you're considering that color for your curtains. I will have to shop with a different vendor to get this particular color. Otherwise, as I stated about the teal curtains I purchased last week for my bedroom, they're great, and I am very happy with them. Amazon and the seller tried to make it right for me, and I appreciate that as well.",

                "reviewText": "I got these curtains in both sage green and white. I love both colors (well, white is white), but these are definitely NOT blackout curtains (especially the white, of course). They do dim the rooms, so that is nice and helps keep them cool (I live in Florida, and it's summer). They do make a difference. I haven't had them long enough to get a new electric bill, but I can feel the cooler temps in the rooms that I have them in (excluding the white. Of course).They are so easy to hang, and I love the grommets because not only do they mean these curtains will last longer, but they just glide across the curtain rod when you wish to open them! No tugging or pulling or wrestling with the curtains. So great!These curtains are very soft and hang beautifully. I did have to rehang the first ones, but that was user error (I hadn't aligned them on the rod so that they would not have a gap when closed; easy fix, though, just started on the opposite zig. Or maybe it was a zag. Heh.)Most of the regular light that comes through is at the top (where the grommets are and above--as with most curtains), and I'm not sure how that can be managed if you are truly looking for blackout curtains. These aren't that. Even the main part over the window still lets the light in, but it is very much dimmed and suitable, I think, for a nice nap in the room.I really think these are great, but keep looking if you need actual blackout curtains.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the white 52x84 curtains to go with the set of sheer \u201cMoroccan trellis diamond\u201d curtains (also Koufall, also 52x84) we received as a wedding gift. The curtains are perfect in every way EXCEPT they delivered the wrong size. We received ones that barely measured to 42\u201d leaving us with 10\u201d difference, that we\u2019re just going to put up with because I don\u2019t want to deal with the hassle of returning them and reordering the correct size.All in all, they are very nice curtains. They feel great, block out a lot of light for being light colored curtains, and definitely help control the temps seeping in from the window.",

The only negative that I could see was that the curtains have about a 1/4\" hemline at the bottom so I shortened them abit to give them a wider hemline which now makes them look much nicer and not cheap. Bought enough to do four windows and so glad I did.",
