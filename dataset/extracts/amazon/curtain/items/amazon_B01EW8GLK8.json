I got the package of 4. 84\u201d in length because I hung the rods closer to the ceiling which makes the room look more like vaulted ceiling (I think) . This was easy to install, no snags and the sheer look gives it a nice cover but does not close in the room. It\u2019s a small room so I wanted to make sure the colors were light. I put before and after pictures. I didn\u2019t iron them because I was too excited to put them up. Great price",
