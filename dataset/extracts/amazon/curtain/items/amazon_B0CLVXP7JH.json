                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. After buying an older home with various window sizes it was difficult finding curtains to fit the length and width. Thankfully I came across these pinch plate tiers that I was able to fit with the 30\" length by using tension rods and ring clips rather than the pins that came with each set, this allowed for the right length I needed. The cotton/linen blend is a nice quality, they're soft and provide just the right amount of privacy. Prior to hanging I ironed to smooth out the mionor wrinkles. As shown in photos there are some minor defects which I guess is expected at this price point with thread's sewn into the top header or a slight defect in the material with linen of another color weaved and blue pen marks. I just used these in windows that were not in prime view. I purchased 11 sets and even with these minor issues, overall I am very pleased with these tiers and would recommend them to someone looking for privacy and wants to upgrade the look in a room with a pinch pleat design.",
