My only concern is the adhesive on the back of the velcro is extremely sticky and will most likely pull the paint off when removed. If you can live with repainting your door this won't be a problem for you. My only complaint is I wish the straps were longer or adjustable so that you can lower the curtain a bit lower. The material is decent. It's not to thick or thin, providing adequate coverage.",

They\u2019ve been up about two months and have stayed there. if I were going to retract and lower them frequently, I would get a pull shade.

I had a diff color that didn't quite work so ordered this one but it is about 25 inch wide not 26 so it's a bit small in my window but I made it work. It looks great!! The only other issue I had is that when tied up (which is how it would be permently for decor) it is very short looking so I cut the straps, added some ribbon that is hidden behind the curtain and hangs much nicer. I also cut a pillow case to line the back of it and just pinned it in place as the natural light coming thru didn't look great! In all honesty I found it really hard to find something with this look on a budget so I was happy to put a little extra work into it and have this outcome.",
