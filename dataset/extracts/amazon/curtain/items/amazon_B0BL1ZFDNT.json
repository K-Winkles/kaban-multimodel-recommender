Schumacher & Co., a maker of exclusive European fabrics, launched Waverly in 1923 to bring home d\u00e9cor to the emerging market of American consumers who desired accessible style. The first collection consisted of eight patterns by American designer Cy Clark, and its instant popularity led to a rapid expansion of the line. The company registered the name Waverly Bonded Fabrics in 1926, and F. Schumacher hired advertising firm J. Walter Thompson to develop a promotional campaign, making Waverly synonymous with the American home since the Roaring Twenties. Waverly responded to consumer requests with the addition of its coordinating wallpapers in 1939 and the Waverly Home Fashions division in 1951, bringing its fabric collections to a gamut of home furnishings. The \u201cWaverly Signature Look,\u201d including the company\u2019s famous Glosheen chintzes, florals, stripes, and plaids became synonymous with American d\u00e9cor, evolving into a legacy which represents quality and timelessness.",
