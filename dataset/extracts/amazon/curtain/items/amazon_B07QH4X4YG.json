                "reviewText": "These are simple sheer tier curtains. I use them on my window over the kitchen sink. On my other window I put holiday themed valances or swags and just add these tiers to the sink window in a matching or complimentary color. I have orange (Halloween), green (Thanksgiving), dusty blue (Jan/Feb), and burgundy red (Christmas). They are plain, just a little pop of color. They are made well enough, not cheap looking. They wash (cold) & dry (in dryer or hang) great! On Amazon be sure to look through all of the selections (search sheer tiers) there are many brands/colors AND prices. I have paid as low as around $6 for a pair. One brand or another is almost always on sale! Many also have a great variety of lengths. If you\u2019re looking for simple but nice take a look at these.",

I put them in small cafe-sized windows that are high on the ceiling so my concern was more for letting light in rather than privacy. They are very sheer so if privacy is the goal, these aren\u2019t it. I also took a long time to steam out the heavy wrinkles, but once that was done, they looked great.",
