                "reviewText": "I should have read the description on this more carefully. Looking at the picture, I thought it was white. Fortunately the merchant does offer this in white & I'll likely pick several up in that color.That said, these are very pretty curtains. I especially like the pinch pleats along the top. It gives the curtain a more formal appearance, but the semi-sheer, natural blend of the fabric offers a more relaxed vibe. It's nice. It's a nice change from heavy, formal curtains, sheers and more cafe curtain type designs.Last year, I saw a very pretty room decorating idea in Better Homes & Gardens. The room was painted a pale blue & the windows were decorated with pinch pleated white curtains. The bedspread & other soft furnishings were simple blue & white patterns. In the photo the curtains were more formal, heavy, lined drapes. I prefer a more relaxed environment, especially in the bedroom & these are perfect. They're crisp enough to make a statement, but not so stiff as to be stuffy-looking.I bought the bedspread, pillow shams & other soft furnishings immediately when I found items that I really liked. But I haven't been able to find pinch pleated drapes that weren't lined &heavy, until I found these drapes. I just love the linen look, with it's more casual feel. Now I can finally finish up with the bedroom renovation.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased these curtains for my home, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations. The pinch pleats along the top add a touch of formality while maintaining a relaxed vibe, making them perfect for creating a cozy environment in my bedroom. Unlike heavy, formal curtains or cafe designs, these curtains strike the right balance.Setting them up was a breeze, and the classic, neutral style seamlessly fits into any room's decor. My daughter loves them in her room, and their sheer quality allows a beautiful play of natural light. The panels have a nice weight to them, and the fabric gives off a high-end curtain appearance with a soft, linen-like feel.Wrinkles are easily smoothed out, and considering the quality, the price feels like a steal. The flexibility and sturdiness of the linen used instill confidence in their durability. They offer a variety of lengths, so measuring carefully is essential to ensure a perfect fit.While they don't completely block out light, they do a commendable job of making sunlight more tolerable and pleasant. The natural light cream shade is simply stunning, adding a touch of elegance to my home. I used a tension rod and purchased separate curtain rings for hanging, and the pleated/pinched look was ready to go without any steaming needed.In conclusion, these curtains are a fantastic addition to my home. Their quality, appearance, and affordability make them a standout choice, and I'm now a fan of this brand. If you're looking for curtains that blend style, functionality, and comfort, these are a top-notch option.",

                "reviewText": "First, let me say, these are very nice quality curtains. They didn't work out for me because the color was slightly warmer than what I needed to match the rest of the room. They are not blackout curtains so a bit of light does come through, which can affect how the color is portrayed. I wanted something like this, with just the linen and no blackout material, but unfortunately, the color still didn't quite work out. Otherwise, beautiful, well made curtains.",

If not for that, they\u2019d have gotten a higher rating. They\u2019re soft, the color is gorgeous, and they\u2019re thick enough to block a substantial amount of light without being completely blackout curtains. I was able to fix the pull for the most part, and they look great in my living room, so I won\u2019t complaint too terribly much, but the was kind of a bummer to open my new curtain and see they weren\u2019t in perfect condition.",
