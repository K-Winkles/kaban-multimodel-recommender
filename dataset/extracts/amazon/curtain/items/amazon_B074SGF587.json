                "reviewText": "I bought a set of blackout curtains for my bedroom (purple with silver lines) so I could sleep a bit later. A couple weeks later, I ordered 2 more pair for my house (red with silver lines, and cream with silver \"raindrops\"). I suffer from migraines and sometimes, your house just needs to be DARK. so I'm writing one review and posting it on all 3 products so you can get a compare-and-contrast.---SIZING---I found that all 3 sets had a nice variety of sizes to fit the window. I like that all 3 sets came in a pair. I have a bay window in front, and the cream curtains span the distance since there are two.---DESIGN---I like the swirly lines. they add a little bling without being too obnoxious. in real life, they look a bit like Christmas tree tinsel. the \"raindrops\" don't really look like raindrops; they do look a bit odd, but I still really like them. it's a bit understated elegance.---COLOR---the purple and cream are really close to what shows up on my monitor (your monitor may vary.) the purple is deep, rich eggplant. and the cream is a light off-white. the red is a bit brighter / lighter. instead of tipping towards burgandy, it's closer to a true, hot red.---GROMMETS---I'm used to grommets on curtains. they remind me of shower curtains. I'm a fan of the style. I will say that some light gets in on the top. if you need complete black, you might need some kind of shield or valance...or to get a style that doesn't have grommets.---BLACKOUT---the manufacturer is pretty upfront about effiacy: the darker the color, the better the blackout. I found that to be true. the purple are the darkest, followed by the red, with the cream in a distant third. that said, they're cream-colored curtains and still blocking probably 65-70% of the light! again, if you need full dark, definitely go with a dark, rich color. the purple in my bedroom can convince anyone it's midnight at noon.---CONSTRUCTION---the material on all 3 sets can only be described as luxurious. it's so bloody soft!! the stitching is solid and the fabrics feel well-made. they're all heavy and feel durable. I believe I will be using these curtains for many, many years.---OVERALL---I have to say, I never saw myself as a person who'd put curtains in my dining room and living room. when I bought my house, they came with blinds, and for 6 years, blinds have been fine. now that I have these, I will never go back. they're wonderful. I love how rich the feel is in the rooms with them, I love using them when I don't feel well to manage light, and I really enjoy how pretty they are hanging up. get some; you'll be glad you did.",

You should really double that for a look that doesn\u2019t look like a banjo string drawn tight. It\u2019s a shame that these don\u2019t come in different sizes but the price is impossible to beat.
