I struggled to find a curtain that let the natural light in, but blocked out the suns heat in the afternoon. It was also hard to find something that was sheer but not completely see through at night time. This checked all my boxes!! Blocks out the suns heat, also blocks cold drafts, let\u2019s in a ton of natural light but allows privacy at night! The material is nice, the quality is nice and they look pretty!!! I highly recommend these!",
