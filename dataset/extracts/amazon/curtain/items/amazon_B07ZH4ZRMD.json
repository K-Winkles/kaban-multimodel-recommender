I got the green and although its not that vibrant it does get the job done with the sunlight but can look grey for the most part. The quality of it isn\u2019t the best just a basic fabric however it keeps out a lot of light and make my room pitch black. They give you 2 strips to hang so that\u2019s good for when one runs out, it\u2019s an adhesive Velcro and not that noticeable. The cut on the curtain looks a bit uneven but I still need to steam and straighten. Overall great purchase not the best quality but it does keep out the sun and heat and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s capable of holding up in most conditions. I think you should buy this product but if you want a better design and fabric quality you should skip.",

                "reviewText": "I really love the idea of these curtains. They seemed easy to put up and look great. The rolling up after they've been down is a bit of a pain, but worth the trouble for me. UNFORTUNATELY after being up for a few weeks, the stickiness started giving way on some of them. They attach by way of Gorilla tap being stuck to the back side of the velcro strip that adheres to your window or door frame. After a few weeks the velcro began to pull away from the tape. To be fair, I did try to reposition the tape when I was attaching it on one of the windows (9) that I was putting the curtain in and it was one of the 3 (so far) that have begun to come down. It was awful trying to remove this Gorilla tape (even using goo gone) but managed to get 90% of it off and put them up again. So far so good. However, two other curtains have come away from the tape. I simply have pressed them down again and do that every so often I just run my fingers over them to press them down. I haven't had further problems with them falling since I've been doing this. I think it would be a problem if I was unrolling them every evening, you would have to be very gentle in doing it. I have 9 windows in this room so I don't do it every day because it really isn't terrible convenient. But, they DO look nice and add warmth to the room. I'm happy with how they look...as long as they stay up!",

I have had them for several months and no issues. I do wonder about the Velcro that holds them rolled up and if it will last. No issues though this far. Wouldn't hesitate to buy again especially at this price. Doesn't matter if the dogs destroy them (they shouldn't if I remember to roll them up).",

However, the tape separates and the adhesive side stuck on the surface and the remainder of the tape on the curtain so, the curtain keeps falling down. I used all of the tape and still doesn't work. Now the surface is sticky with adhesive and its peeling off the surface when I try to remove it. I reached out to the seller and even after 6 days, no response. Worst service ever.",
