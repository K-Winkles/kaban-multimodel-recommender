                "reviewText": "Very, very happy with these! I paid $52, including tax and shipping, for two pairs of 52\u201dx84\u201d curtains. These come as pairs, so I purchased two sets (a total of four panels) to cover one dining room wall consisting of three floor-to-ceiling windows. The fibre content is 70% linen, 30% polyester. What a fantastic price! And you can machine-wash them! I\u2019d do them with no other laundry in, on gentle, cool, and just hang them back up again to dry.I love the quality of light that these create, a lovely soft, dreamy diffuse-ness. They are not super-sheer; during the day, people outside cannot see in, while you can see out. At night, you will still want to draw your heavier drapes.There are two white shades: Pure White and Off White. I tried both. As others have stated, White (neither one) is NOT a pure, bright, stark white. Both shades (I\u2019d imagine all the colours offered) have slubs throughout inherent in linen; these slubs are a natural linen colour (pale taupe). The Pure White is whiter than the Off White (as the names suggest). The Off White leans ever so slightly towards greyish-taupe, rather than towards yellow. For my decor, the Off White was more suitable.There are three possibilities on the rod pockets, which I discovered when I accidentally put two of the curtains on upside-down through the hem. Probably not meant to be a rod pocket, but the sides are open and if your curtain rod has a really big diametre you might prefer to use that.The stitching isn\u2019t the best but I found no glaring problems.I\u2019ve only had these up for three days and have already recommended them to friends. The effect is beautiful and the price simply can\u2019t be beat. I searched Amazon and sampled other brands and linen blends (none so high a linen percentage as these), even some pricey pure linen ones that didn\u2019t offer shade options that worked for me. If even the thought of nylon or polyester makes you shudder and you want an organic look/feel with ease of care, these will probably make you as happy as they did me.",

                "reviewText": "I like the look and material of these curtains. I bought the off white color because I believe the white were out of stock. The off white is much more of a very pale beige. Definitely wish I would have ordered the white instead. Which I suspect will also be more of an off white but I'm hoping just a little more white than what I received now.They are light filtering curtains but only block the same amount of light as my white sheers do. I expected them to block a little more light than they do. I bought them for my bedroom, I have blinds on all the windows, and they are just too sheer.They look like they made ZERO difference compared to the blinds alone. I could see the blinds right through them, however, they do add a bit of privacy if you are looking in from the outside. They just do not work for my bedroom at all and I think they look a bit ugly being able to see the blinds through them. It almost looks like you applied a highlighter over them.I still like the curtains but I will have to try them in my dining room, where I don't need much privacy or light blocking.One other thing I wasn't too pleased with was the length. I normally use 84\" curtains in my bedroom and it works but these ended up being far too short. They hit above the baseboards and I don't like how they look. We had to move my curtain rod down to 83 inches which was the lowest we could hang it. We still ended up hitting the metal frame around the window and couldn't secure the middle bracket. They are still way too short.I'd definitely recommend going with a longer length and using curtain rings to give you a much nicer look.",

                "reviewText": "Beautiful curtains and truly SEMI-SHEER. The fabric is soft and drapes very well, which gives a room a more expensive look. The weave and texture of them is exactly as shown in the pictures. Yes, they are a blend of linen and polyester, but the fabric looks like a true woven linen (and I'm very familiar with many types of fabrics since I've sewn for 50+ years), without the tendency to wrinkle as 100% linen would do. These do not have any sheen to them as some sheers are prone to have. IMHO, a sheen cheapens the look, whereas these give the look of a soft, matte, more expensive fabric. I also love that you are able to see through these enough to look outside without having to pull them to the side, yet (during daylight hours) it would take more effort for someone on the outside to see inside. They are not a privacy curtain for nighttime use, but semi-sheer curtains are never intended for that use. I lightly steam-ironed them before hanging to remove the folds from packing. Definitely a great buy.",

The fabric is soft, the quality is superb, and installation was a breeze. They provide just the right amount of light and privacy. If you want luxurious-looking curtains on a budget, these are a fantastic choice! Highly recommended!",
