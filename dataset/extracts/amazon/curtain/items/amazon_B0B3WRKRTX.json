                "reviewText": "This curtain suits my needs perfectly. I was seeking something for my kitchen door window that offered privacy at night yet could easily be adjusted for sunlight during the day. Installation needed to be hassle-free, without dealing with curtain rods or screws. This was the ideal fix. The velcro firmly adheres to the doorframe, and raising the curtain is a breeze. It's supported by two straps and is also equipped with velcro.When hanging this curtain, caution is advised. The adhesive is very sticky, so once it's in place, it stays put. If you initially apply it unevenly, readjusting might pose a challenge. The yellow shade is a tad darker than my usual preference, but surprisingly, it complements my kitchen decor well.I highly recommend these curtains to anyone in search of a quick, simple solution for window coverings. They offer the privacy needed at night while easily adjusted to allow daylight in during the day. However, ensure precision during installation due to the strong adhesive.",

                "reviewText": "Update: So happy with my first purchase, I ordered 2 more. This time I went with the Coffee color 30\u201dby \u201c68 for my double French doors. With winter approaching, and my recliner by the doors, it cuts down on the cold draft from the windows. I was concerned about the length, adhesive and cold weather considering they are metal doors, but like my previous order, they are holding up just fine. Previous order & comment: Better than expected and happy I ordered two sets. Material is soft and it blocks out the light. They also give you privacy. My previous curtains you could see through especially at night with the lights on. Easy to hang and roll back up. I\u2019m tall, so that helps. The adhesive backing works great on both my metal and wood door. Very tacky velcro strip, so make sure you know where you are going to place them before removing the backing. There are also two small tabs that need to be removed on the inside velcro that keep the curtain straps in place once hung. I hung both of these curtains as soon as they arrived so as you can see, the material is a little wrinkled yet from the packaging. They should straighten out in a few days. Both my widows are 24\u201d inches wide by 36\u201d inches long. I ordered both curtains 26\u201d inches wide by 40\u201d inches long and they work great. Perfect size. Wish I would have seen these sooner. I had used nails in my wooden door to hang my previous curtain rods and magnetic rods on my metal door that always slid down and scratched my door.",
