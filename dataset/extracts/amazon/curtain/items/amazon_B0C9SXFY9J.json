                "reviewText": "I ordered this Set of 2 of Non-See-Through Door Curtains for our front foyer. We haven\u2019t replaced the set we\u2019ve had for way too long so they were way overdue. This set appear to be well made & is a light shade of grey. They fit really well & hang nicely. You can make out shadows on the other side of the sheer curtain from inside looking out but you cannot see inside what-so-ever. I really like this because our previous ones didn\u2019t allow for as much secrecy. They are also plenty wide which allows you to gather them up a lot in-between each end for the perfect flow(if I\u2019m saying that correctly?\ud83d\ude05). Overall, I am very happy with these & would recommend.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25Shalom\u2026",
