Newly built house with VERY LARGE windows and one of my guest bedrooms faces due east so the morning sun was very bright for several hours and the room warms ups pretty quickly. (Not a problem if no one is in there but when our daughter stays over we hear about it). I tried a couple of different ones without much luck. These curtains did the job and the material is very nice to the touch and eye pleasing. The color says rust but I'd put it in a deep pumpkin which worked good with the orange and teal bedding in this room. I've ordered more for some of my other rooms in other colors. I've paid much more for draperies in the past that I didn't like as much as I do these.",
