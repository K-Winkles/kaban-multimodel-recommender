                "reviewText": "First, if you\u2019re only looking at the front side of these, I think they are pretty good curtains. I prefer a heavier, linen look, and these fall somewhere between the really expensive ones and the cheap ones that say blackout, but aren\u2019t really. You can see in some of the pictures that the fabric drapes nicely, there\u2019s a bit of a faux-linen look (although there\u2019s not really any texture to it), and there is a blackout coating on the back that is *actually* blackout. That being said, I won\u2019t be using these as I prefer a fabric blackout lining and this is sort of a plasticized coating. I realize this is a sensory sensitivity thing, but I really don\u2019t like the way they feel or sound when pulling them closed, and I think a fabric backing gives a fuller look and insulates more, so my search continues.",

And I was impressed by how wrinkle-free they are, even after being packaged away in a plastic container for the journey to my house.I actually could have used one more panel to make the backdrop even wider, but I guess there's a way to do that--like purchase another one!I actually could have used one more panel to make the backdrop even wider, but I guess there's a way to do that--like get another one!I'm sure I'm not the first to see the value of using these curtains in this way, but if you're inspired to try it yourself, I think you'll be pleased.Oh.

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Fabric isn't suited for my bedroom I hoped it would be but it's like the mid century modern fabric you see everywhere. I had blackout/temp reg drapes from a discount retailer that were very high quality so I was surprised these were so flimsy. I also was not aware that despite Vine letting me place another order for them (so I could actually use the curtains) and taking away my option to get anything else in place they didn't end up sending me another set nor was I aware. I was not going to pay what they were charging for these as they are just not the quality I am looking for. I was not aware the fabric was not a solid grey either as the picture did not do it justice. In the end I had to put them in between two old curtains I have to replace and will need to replace them all. Also they have slots to hang them through and that would have made them even longer and they are very long now. The material is very thin, black on the other side which I don't like ( they make blackout curtains that are not black on one side) I can't recommend them.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for curtains that were insulating and light-blocking for my son's first apartment living room, and these will suit just fine. It was really tricky choosing which of the several shades of beige that are offered was the right tone, but I think the \"Natural\" that we ultimately decided on was the right call. I was looking for something in a true-neutral to slightly warm-neutral to work with his furniture, and this is pretty close. If you're also not sure which one to go with, scrolling over the color options on my PC in a browser helped a lot in better seeing the difference in the tones. The fabric on the front feels like canvas or a stout tweed more than linen, but the look is pretty good. I was surprised by the (plastic?) backing, but not really put-off by it as I didn't find it altered how the curtains look when hung and don't really care if it looks like the curtains look like they're solid black from the outside. I didn't find them to be a true \"blackout,\" like I would want if I were trying to sleep during the day. But for darkening a living room so there's no glare on the TV or your laptop screen, these handle that with ease. Overall, they're what we were hoping they would be and are satisfied with them.Bonus points for not having grommets and instead having rod pocket, tab, or clip options for hanging.",
