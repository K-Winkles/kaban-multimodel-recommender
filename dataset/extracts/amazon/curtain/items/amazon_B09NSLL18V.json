I removed them from the package and the creases faded quickly after a few days on the curtain rod. They also hang and slide nicely. The hem seems to be durable and done in a thoughtful manner to insure longevity. I definitely recommend these curtains and would purchase them again for other windows in my home!",

They are sheer enough to let light in while still filtering out some sun and giving a little privacy. The beige is a really nice colour that isn't too yellowy a beige. It's a slightly cool beige that leans toward taupe but when the sun hits them they are less cool looking. At night they are more so. They don't look cheap. Mine came with no flaws or pulls.
