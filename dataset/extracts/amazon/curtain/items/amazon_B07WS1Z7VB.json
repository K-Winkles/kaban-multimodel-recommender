I needed to buy three sets to replace my previous curtains which are now too short because I removed the ring clips that had began to rust after years of use in our humid climate. I was looking for something simple, in a natural material and white color, that didn\u2019t block too much light. These curtains were exactly what I was looking for. They are lightweight, but provide the right amount of brightness and security to my bedroom. The texture is subtle, but still noticeable, especially when closed. The packaging of the three sets were not identical, but the product itself all appeared to be the same. I was aware from previous reviewers that there would be shrinkage, so I bought the next size up (which I needed anyway since my rods were hung higher to accommodate for the ring clips that I would not be using anymore). They did shrink even though I washed in cold water and dried at a low temperature, but I didn\u2019t measure exactly how much. After washing, drying and ironing, their length is slightly longer than where I like my curtains to hang, but I think they look nice. They were easy to iron and hang on the rod. For the price, I feel like these are nice quality, and I am glad I bought them.",

Looked like a pale red marker and it did not wash out (though I didn\u2019t use bleach). One mark I cut off by hemming them and the other just got hidden in the folds. No one will see it but me.

They are not too sheer and they are ok for bedroom privacy.You need to wash them first - I did light drying and then air dried them. They do shrink a little bit so if you do that, they should not shrink if you wash again. Overall, I am very pleased with them, color and materials for the price.",

But because they were deeply creased from the packaging, I tossed them in the washer according to the instructions (cold, delicate). While they washed, I almost bought another pair but wisely waited until the wash cycle was over before committing to another pair. I was surprised (but not really, deep inside) to find that the curtains had shrunk significantly (of course the poly lining didn't, making the shrinking even more ridiculous and insulting). In the photo, the 84\" curtains are hanging in an 80\" door frame. You can see they're at least 4\" too short, and you can see that stupid lining, taunting). So I get to return these and start all over. I'm so tired of getting junk. So, so tired. No standards whatsoever anymore. None.",
