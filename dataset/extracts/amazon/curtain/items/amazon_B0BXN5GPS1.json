                "reviewText": "I searched Amazon for hours to find linen textured, light-filtering curtain panels with either bronze or black grommets. And in a shade of blue that wasn\u2019t too dark like navy or sapphire, didn\u2019t look like baby blue, and wasn\u2019t grey. Not easy! So I am absolutely thrilled to have found these beautiful curtains. I ordered the \u201cStone Blue\u201d to go with a \u201cNatural\u201d color of linen curtains from another brand (Voilybird). They look really nice together and the grommets even match. I appreciate how the linen material looks and feels more substantial and robust than a silkier voile, yet still provides the light filtering aspect I was after. I\u2019ve just ordered another set to add to this window to bulk up the blue accent, and then will be installing a 1\u201d black curtain rod to hold the \u201cnatural\u201d colored panels all the way across the center. Hence, the reason I was after darker grommets! I just didn\u2019t think silver grommets would blend well with a black curtain rod. I would highly recommend these curtains.",
