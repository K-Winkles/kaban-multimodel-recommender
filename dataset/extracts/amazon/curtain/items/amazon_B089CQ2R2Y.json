Arrived very wrinkled, as most curtains do - you will definitely need to launder or use a steamer.",

These were some of the only ones I was able to find for a shorter window that actually looked high quality! They have a nice texture to them with streaks of brown/beige which give them a more natural fiber look.Yes, they are horribly wrinkled when you take them out of the packaging. I have not tried to seam them yet and am hoping that they will relax a bit on their own. The large grommets even left circle prints along the curtain but, again, this is something that should relax over time. Overall they have a great look and are definitely blackout which is perfect for my nursery. Would buy again!",

                "reviewText": "I was a bit nervous after reading some reviews about pinholes of light coming through and lots of wrinkles, but we didn\u2019t have any issues. They totally darkened the room mid-day, and there were minimal creases. It did help laying them out on the bed for a bit before hanging.We don\u2019t have any light coming through at all besides the top above the curtain rod as expected (see photos), and we\u2019re thrilled that they\u2019re thermal to keep the cold and heat in/out depending on the season. We also like how they\u2019re white on the outside, so it matches with our house trim. We bought two packages of the 84\u201d length for the slider (so there are 4 panels) and just did one package of the 45\u201dish length one (2 panels) on the small window. Turned out exactly like we were hoping. And they\u2019re also a great price, we love the color (this is the mid-gray one, forgot the name), and was much softer than I was expecting. I was worried they\u2019d be plastic feeling, like you might see in a dr\u2019s office, but they\u2019re great. Very happy with these!",

                "reviewText": "I really like these curtains, the sage color is nice. Sizing and quality are very good and consistent. The fabric is not heavy, and sports a printed linen design that is really nice and realistic. The backing is a soft to the touch white material that\u2019s pleasing from the outside. As expected, The curtains were wrinkled after opening, but I tossed in washer and dryer and then worked on the more persistent creases with a steam iron\u2026didn\u2019t take too long to get them into shape..and I\u2019m not a fan of ironing, but this was a quick job with a good stream iron.I hung these in the spare bedroom, my niece is very happy to have more than just the blinds for privacy. They do seem to help in keeping the room a bit warmer, and perhaps a bit quieter.These are advertised as blackout curtains and they do more than an adequate job at blocking light, for my situation. I wasn\u2019t looking for complete blackout, just wanted them to offer good privacy. The 3rd photo was taken at 8:15AM, with the hall light on so the photo wouldn\u2019t be too grainy, to give you a sense of how the blackout feature of these curtains work, should that be a critical feature for you.Overall I highly highly recommend these curtains! I like them so much I ordered another set for the computer room. Hope this review helps you!Oh, by the way\u2026I did add 2.5\u201d wide curtain spacers on the rod between the grommets to make the pleats hold a full look, don\u2019t like a flat, floppy, lifeless curtain (last photo).",

                "reviewText": "We have lived here for close to 40 years, and I have bought blackout curtains before, but these are the best I\u2019ve ever found. We have a west facing sliding door and usually you can see shadows through the curtain. Not with these! I just hung them, it\u2019s a bright sunny day, and no light is getting into my dining room at all, except for the top of the curtain, which cannot be helped with any curtains. My dining room was actually almost dark at 4 in the afternoon. They were wrinkled out of the package which can\u2019t be helped, and had a very slight smell from the factory, so I popped them in the washer on gentle cycle with cold water and dried them till just damp and hung them up that way. That was much easier than ironing them, which is what I saw most people did in the reviews. It\u2019s 6 hours later, the smell is gone, and they look great! I also bought them for my east facing living room, which is very bright on summer mornings, and I can\u2019t wait till tomorrow to hang them! They are very well made with straight seems and the backing held up very well after being washed. They seem like they will last. They colors are beautiful, I bought the sage and the glacier gray and love them both. The sage is perfect in my dining room. A very tasteful and soft muted green. I love sage but I\u2019m very picky about how green it can be. This is a perfect Sage. The glacier gray looks like it will be perfect I my living room. Very clean and simple drapes that are super easy to hang. I thought the price was great too. Two windows and a sliding glass door for about a hundred dollars is a very good deal for this quality. I have bought a lot of curtains over the years as my tastes change and having children and cats is very hard on drapes. I\u2019m very pleased with these and hope I can find the same brand again in a few years when I need to. These are awesome for the price and I would definitely buy them again!",

Tengo un ventanal grande que da a la calle y buscaba privacidad. Est\u00e1s cortinas son hermosas. El color marfil tiene un acabado estilo lino que se ve muy bonito. Cubri\u00f3 perfectamente la luz como se muestran en las fotos. Las recomiendo mucho. Ya compr\u00e9 otros juegos m\u00e1s porque el costo es bastante accesible. Las argollas que traen son de buena calidad y fluyen bien en los cortineros. Llegaron incluso un d\u00eda antes. Si est\u00e1s dudando, an\u00edmate a comprarlas que no te arrepentir\u00e1s.",

They are pretty heavy and they feel more like canvas than linen. I love the colour, black with little threads of black going through it.The wrinkles are crazy especially at the bottom. I spent an hour doing the top half, with a pretty strong clothes steamer and there are still wrinkles in it. I am not sure how i will get the deeper creases out. On the end the crease was really bad. It was going the opposite direction of the curve it's supposed to make so I will be spending a few days trying to get these to look properly. I tried spraying water on them but they are water repellant and it didn't do much.They block the sun pretty good. The first picture was with the lights off in the room and the second one is with the lights on. The light doesn't come through the fabric but there's still a lot coming out the sides and top and there is a covered porch on the other side of that room.Over all I am happy with the way it looks so i am keeping them. The price was really good too.",

I love the ivory color!",
