It overall is a good curtain but as far as wrinkle free, it does have a bit of wrinkles after several days of usage. And as for the value for my money, I do say its a bang for my buck. I do highly recommend this product.",

They create a luxe look of a studio or media room. For the 15ft long curtain we used a steel pipe as the curtain rod to allow the span without a middle support. The eyelets were just too small so we used 75mm key rings to attach the curtain to the rod and this works perfectly.",
