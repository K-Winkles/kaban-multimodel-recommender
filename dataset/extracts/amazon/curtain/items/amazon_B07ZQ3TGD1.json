                "reviewText": "I purchased these curtains to use in a small one bedroom apartment. I wanted something that would look clean, modern and stylish and allow some privacy without blocking out all the natural light. I was also looking for long panels that would hang from the ceiling to the floor to give the illusion of a higher ceiling height. Finally, I wanted a fabric that was sheer, but that didn\u2019t seem cheap. Fortunately, these curtains checked all of the boxes for me. I was really impressed with them right out of the box! They\u2019re a very good weight with a very nice linen like texture, giving the appearance of a much more expensive drapery. The curtains hang very nicely, and all four panels were the exact same length (you\u2019d be surprised how often the panels don\u2019t match). I was very pleased with the end result and would buy these again if needed. Tom Feddor, Chicago IL.",

                "reviewText": "These curtains are pretty good, and fantastic for the cost. We wanted privacy panels for our kitchen because we walk around with no pants on, and the kitchen is messy too. These work during the day, you really can't see anything from outside. But you can see right through them from inside, so you feel like people can see you. At night if you have lights on, people can see straight in. These are better for summer in our household. We mounted them inside the window hole, 2\" from the front edge. They're not mounted too close to the window which helps give more privacy.My sister stood just inside the window and I stood a few feet away outside during a bright day and I literally couldn't see her even though she was very close and waving. The pic from outside is a pic of her waving at me lol.They do not look anything like the pictures as far as the transparency level. You can see right out. You can read license plate numbers through the curtains. You could read a book through them. Maybe part of it is that we got the stark white color. (Btw, I saw other listings saying theirs aren't white but I think they got a mislabeled set, these are very white.)I took a pic from inside with flash to show what they really look like, and one focused on the bush outside to show the detail you can see when you look out. I'll put up a nighttime pic when I can, we just forgot to go back out to get one. I'll also add one of curtains with no wrinkles.The curtains arrived creased and wrinkled. I have a small garment steamer that fixed them right up. They look beautiful. It took a couple hours to do our 45\" curtains because the steamer (and its tank) is small and some of the creases were intense. I thought the fabric might melt or warp. It may have warped a little but to be honest I can't tell for sure, and it looks better anyway. Steaming revealed some unintentional pleats sewn into the bottom seam but you wouldn't notice them during regular use.The tags are at the top of the curtains so I had to cut them off which I'm annoyed about, but they're sewn into the seams so you can't remove the full tag without picking out the seam and sewing it back up again. So the edge of the tag is still in the top seam of these transparent curtains. I don't want to have to keep track of the tag to be able to wash the curtains safely. The tag says they're safe to iron so that's why I felt comfortable steaming them pretty hard.The fabric is really loose so it can catch on anything. Almost immediately after finishing the steaming, I moved my dog's cot back under the window and caught a little rough part of it on the fabric. It pulled a thread that gathered the bottom edge. I'm glad these were so affordable.Anyway I mostly wanted to give people a better idea of how much privacy they really give you.Edit: The darker pic taken from outside i was taken during early evening in the summer. You really have to be careful to close the other curtains/blinds early enough if you're relying on these for privacy. It's not dark outside at all in the pic but you can see right in. I'm pretty sure I've already walked around with no pants on in front of the window when it was this light out \ud83d\ude2c",
