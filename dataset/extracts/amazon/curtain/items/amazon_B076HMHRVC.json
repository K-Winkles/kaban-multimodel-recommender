Thou I have vertical blinds for the patio slider door - I placed this curtain up to block out the sun's extreme heat - it's 114 degrees today - and they are working good for me - to help keep the AC cost down and block the heat from coming inside. The color beige is very pretty - the feel of the material is good, I don't have to iron as they are played/hooked up to my vertical's blind rackets - so I placed this curtain up against the patio windows just to keep the summer's extreme heat in the desert of Nevada. 114 today and going up! and help reduce the heat coming inside. I'm happy with this product and glad I purchased it and I like the material, the color beige and not a heavy curtain - overall it works for me !",

Not totally black out which I wasn\u2019t looking for but definitely blocks a lot of the light. Pretty color exactly what I was looking for, 10 out of 10 recommend. Remember to go bigger if you want to cover the entirety of the window or door.",

I would highly recommend this to anyone who's looking to divide any rooms or to use them as curtains because they actually block out a bunch of light.",
