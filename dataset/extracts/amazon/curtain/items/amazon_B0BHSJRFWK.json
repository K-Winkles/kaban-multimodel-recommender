                "reviewText": "What can possibly be interesting about a review for blackout curtains? Probably not much, but these curtains far exceeded my expectations for the quality of the product received. I ordered the 42W x 24L inch gray blackout curtains for this annoyingly small-shaped window in a master bedroom - that windowmeasures 3 feet wide by 18 inches in length (4.5 sq ft). Try finding blackout curtains for that size at your local home improvement center!Not only did these curtains perfectly match the coverage area, but it was wide enough to form the proper curved hanging lines of a traditional drape. The material is thick and dense-like, and is the definitive answer to blocking out light - even sunlight. The tailoring is single stiched - but it's a quality stitch that's straight as an arrow. Plus, it's pleated on the bottom of the curtain as well so a second rod can be used for applicable window frames/styles. Overall, the most bang for the buck in a curtain set - I never thought I'd be impressed with... curtains. I was wrong.",
