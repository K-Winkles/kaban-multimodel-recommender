I finally just decided to go with these because I liked the color and the texture looked the nicest and they fit within my budget.I\u2019m happy!Things I like:- medium weight. They\u2019re light enough to give you an airy, casual look but still heavy enough that they don\u2019t feel cheap.- the natural color I purchased is really pretty. I\u2019m sick of the all-white everything or all grey and white\u2026 so to keep it natural without being too blah these look great!- As I said earlier - the texture and color is nice if you want something that looks a little more casual, soft, or maybe coastal/cottage-y.Note: I just have a single panel for each side of the window on my bedroom windows, but I am going to purchase another pair for my larger window to give it a fuller look.",

I hung them on sliding clips and they hang just right.The linen blend and texture is lovely.I think I bought the 84\u201d length (maybe 90\u201d) and hung the rod 4-5\u201d above my window so the curtains would come to the baseboards. I didn\u2019t want them puddling or sweeping the floor for dust m/cleaning purposes.They would work with several design styles.",
