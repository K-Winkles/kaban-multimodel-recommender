I have 2 panels up on my bay window and they do an amazing job. I do have blinds behind them. I went from cheap Walmart curtains to these and really had to get used to how dark they make my living room. I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re \u201cblack out\u201d but they are darkening. I got them longer so I could raise my curtain rod to make my room feel bigger and more luxe, they did just that. When I got them out and hung them up I took the time to really steam out the wrinkles and creases with a little hand held steamer. I only ordered 2 panels to see if I would like them and I LOVE them. I will be ordering 2 more panels for my living room to make them look fuller and I will be buying more for other rooms in my house.",

We bought 3 pairs of these curtain panels to create a soft space along one wall to absorb some sound. That said, the fabric is not as heavy as I thought they\u2019d be from the \u201cvelvet\u201d description. I\u2019d describe them more like a very soft microfiber, but they still do have that luxurious feel. I love the color. During they day, they appear much more vibrant and yellow & in the evening a softer gold. Overall, our space feels much more cozy and comfortable and warm. They keep out a lot of light and make it a little too easy to sleep in. Well worth the price - definitely recommend.",

My large window faces an intersection so I was worried they wouldn\u2019t be thick enough to block out the traffic lights, but they do block out almost all of the light (just a smidge off from being fully blacked out, which is pretty amazing in my opinion). They arrived much less wrinkled than I expected and with a good steam I\u2019m pretty sure the fold lines will come right out. The curtains aren\u2019t a true olive color in my opinion, they look almost jewel toned in certain light, but I think they\u2019re very pretty and they suite my needs just fine.",

I wish there was a size length between 90 inches and 96 inches. 90 inches is just a little too short, but 96 inches is way too long. My other complaint is the silver grommets make it look cheap. I wish there was another option for gold. I will have to use some gold rub and buff on the circle grommets to make them look better and match my Decour.These are also great black out curtains! You wouldn\u2019t think so because they are a little thin however, a dark green color works great as black out. They are not lined, however.Overall, for the price and the fact that you get to in a pack, they are a great buy. * my phone did lighten the last picture so they do not look black out in the pic but trust me they do a great job in darkening the room.",
