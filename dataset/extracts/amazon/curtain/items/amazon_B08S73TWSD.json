They hang perfectly on the rods and the length is wonderful. I wasn't expecting such a high end look for what I paid for them. The overall look in my great room was significantly elevated when I hung these curtains. I was so impressed that I ordered additional panels for other rooms in my home. It's also great that each package has 2 panels as opposed to only 1 that you so often get in department stores. I highly recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "Very happy to finally find a nice unlined, lightweight, grommet curtain to hide a clothes closet where the door has been removed. The material is attractive, it drapes well, and the color is as shown. The grommets allow me to slide the drapes open when I want to get something from the closet, unlike the tab tops which didn't slide. If you're fussy (I'm not) and think everything should be perfect, they arrived slightly wrinkled. Did I mention they're unlined and lightweight? Yes, yes I did. So, if you are looking for light blocking (this is light filtering) expensive drapes, move on. These drapes go perfectly with my boho bedroom decor and I'm extremely happy with this purchase.",

We needed 2 sets otherwise it looked like we just hung white sheets in the window. You can't tell where there's a break in the panels. They look great for the price and they were just what we were looking for.",

                "reviewText": "Sheer enough to let light in, opaque enough that people can't just see in your windows. I have them hanging on magnetic rods on French Doors and they work great. This is the third set I have ordered. Not because the curtains are poorly made, but because my husband has an a@@hole cat that finds great amusement in sticking her claws in them and causing pulls. That said, for the first several, I can tug the fabric and due to the type of weave, the pulls will often just kind of straighten out and disappear. After so many times, tho, the pulls are obvious and they need to be replaced. These wash and dry great without having to iron to rehang as long as you pull them as soon as they're dry and don't let them sit bunched up in the dryer. The color is a true Terra Cotta, very bright and warm.",

I have online courses this semester and needed a curtain that would let light through but also not blind me when the Sun was setting. These fit the bill perfectly! I got two sets (total of four panels) used and there\u2019s nothing wrong with them. One set came wrinkled but gravity will fix that. They slide like butter on my curtain rod and the color matches the scheme I picked. I have nothing but positive things to say.",
