                "reviewText": "The twist tie will take from the width of the curtain. Purchased sheer for my oversized sunroom not wanting to weigh down the room due to it being narrow. The twisted tab will work fine on my oversized windows. I purchased a set of 3 curtains 6 panels in all. 2 panels each at 50 x 84. The set of panels are running short due to the twisted tie. The French doors (the width of the entire door is 77.5 outer) and the panel looks too small per door at what should be 100 in width. I did not want to double up or half up due to the doors being open all summer long (remember going light). Also, I measured the curtains and they are not True to size Length and width off slightly but I was trying to cover the tops of the door opening due to appearance and that extra inch was needed. Glad I purchased tieback it makes them appear much nicer looking. All in all it softens the room and will appear breezy. Yes I will be keeping them and am fairly happy. It is a bit bohemian looking but my room was a little on the rustic side so it worked. Softened it right up. You may want to size up.",
