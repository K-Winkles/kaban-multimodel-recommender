                "reviewText": "Not sure how they do it but they really do block light. They are not backed with a vinyl coating like other curtains I previously had. The back is same color as curtain and they feel like just one nice thick piece of material. They are very soft and silky feeling to touch and colors are very rich and true to color swatches on Amazon website. I bought 2 sets in AQUA and Dark TEAL. They came very wrinkled out of the package and did not dewrinkle in my dryer. I hung them and used a steamer and the wrinkles came out pretty well. I am very pleased with their quality, rich color and color variety, measurement accuracy, price and light blocking ability. My bedroom windows are large and get full sun in AM and these keep me sleeping in after the sun's up! My Living room gets full sun in the afternoon and pulling these curtains help keep my room cool. I highly recommend this product.",

I have a neighbor who has a fetish for motion detecting lights on his garage and home (prison lights I call them) that are so bright the illuminate rooms that aren\u2019t facing his home. I put these up and not one bit of light shined through them. The drapes have tabs and a pocket so you don\u2019t have to buy new rods which I\u2019d an extra bonus. They are weighty, so make sure the window they will be hanging from can have anchored or heavier duty brackets (if using the rod pocket. They are also manufactured well - no crooked seams or hems and they have thread that matches so stitching doesn\u2019t show. Any wrinkles that were in them out of the package are quickly falling out. Additionally, the drapes are soft to the touch and had no chemical smell out of the package. I seriously am a fan of these drapes!",

I did read some reviews prior to buying them and saw that a few said they don\u2019t block 100% of the light but still block a good portion. I agree with this. I\u2019d say they block out about 95% of natural light in our bedroom (we have a lot of natural light, but the sun does not hit directly on our room..results could vary based on sun positioning I would think). The light sage green is the color i ordered and they still block a lot of light. The material is thick and feels like it\u2019s good quality, especially for the price.
