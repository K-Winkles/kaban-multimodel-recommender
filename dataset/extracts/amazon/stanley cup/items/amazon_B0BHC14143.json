I LOVE the fun bright colors, they just make me happy!The size is good, it fits in a cupholder, and I\u2019m drinking tons more water due to the convenience of the straw (I was previously using a screw top water bottle which was more annoying to drink in the car or when I was otherwise busy).It is pretty heavy and the handle is bulky, but it doesn\u2019t leak when it tips over and does a good job keeping my water cold. The lid is easy to screw on and off but still looks very sleek.Definitely recommend this tumbler, I feel it\u2019s a great price for a good product!",

I was worried because I saw some reviews saying it chipped at the top where the lid screws but I did not have that problem upon arrival. I really like how there aren\u2019t a lot of of pieces or nooks and crannies where mold can gather. It\u2019s very lightweight and comes with an extra straw. It\u2019s been 8 hours and my drink is still really cold.",

It is a great size, keeps drinks cold for hours as advertised, fits perfectly in cup holders and is overall amazing! It's not as heavy as some of its competitors. The price is better which is an added bonus. Lots of color choices too! I have several brands and this is right up there at the top. Highly recommend this tumbler.",

I also saw the prices for Stanley\u2019s and wasn\u2019t a fan.I did my research on this brand and I\u2019m really happy I bought this. I bought it so I can have a cute tumbler during my labor and delivery. It\u2019s leakproof (especially when the straw is not in there). That\u2019s extremely important to me. It stays colds and holds about 40 oz of liquid. This really helps me get my required water intake while being pregnant. The design and colors are beautiful and it\u2019s nice and slender. I like that it has a screw on top. I really like that I was able to buy this cup and still had enough money to buy little cup accessories. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that with the Stanley and still stay under $45.",

                "reviewText": "I did a lot of research to figure out the best cup, and I think I made a good choice with Simple Modern. It is stylish, easy to hold, easy to drink from, and holds a lot of water. That said, there are things that were not quite what I expected.The biggest was the color! On the Amazon site, the \"Sunburst\" looks like a bright red tumbler with a pink lid and handle. In reality, it is more of a reddish-orange color (coral, I guess?) with a pink handle and lid. Oddly, the straw is a true red. So, in this case, the straw does not even match the tumbler. It doesn't entirely bother me, although I did ponder returning it for a different color. I don't think I would have selected a coral-colored mug in any other situation, but it's mine now and I am going to learn to love it.The other thing that was advertised that might be a big deal for others but less for me is that it definitely does not keep ice for a long time. It definitely keeps water cooler than room temperature, but on the occasions I have added ice, it was melted in a few hours. If you're someone who needs very cold water for a long time, this mug is not for you.",
