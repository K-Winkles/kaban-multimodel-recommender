                "reviewText": "This is going to sound like a negative review, but I do actually REALLY like these. What I like about these is that the images are pretty crisp compared to other small mario toys/party favors which can be tough to find. The colors of the actual characters are crisp and bright like you'd expect from mario and this is important for a birthday party. I'm also relieved they fit a standard size/restaurant size straw diameter. I got these to go onto reusable, standard size straws for my son's birthday party and they are the exact size I needed.They have a lot of manufacture imperfections for their functionality. What I noticed is when you cap the Bowser straw, Bowser is entirely upside down. This seems a bit awkward, as though he should be rightside up when capped because he hangs limp when off the cap. The gumba was somehow glued to both the base and cap so I had to carefully pry it apart for it to be usable. The star power cap has a strap that is flatter than it should be, and looks like it had been splattered and smooshed when being made, and then hardened that way. Even my 11yr old son looked at these and said they were really cool, but he doesn't think they're going to hold up long at all (maybe through the party maybe not). Another thing is, they fit nicely on the straws, but they're tough to get on because they're actually made of a really grippy rubber, and they are nearly impossible to take off once they're on. Maybe this is good for some people. For parents washing reusable kid straws, not so much. The characters also feel like they will pop off the caps really easily because they're not one solid piece with the cap. They're melted on. I think for the price and the fact that I'm using these for party favors/prize boxes, I'm happy with these, but I think people should know the facts before they buy.",
