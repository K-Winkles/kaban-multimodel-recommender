The bottom of the travel cup is smaller and it fits right in your cup holder!!! Genius!!! That was always an issue. It has not leaked at all. So many colors to choose from. I get so many compliments and inquiries. Now it is a bit pricey but it\u2019s the only one you will need. Worth it l. Get it!!",

                "reviewText": "|Stanley 40oz Color Cream | I love this cup alot! as it did not say it was leak proof was a little disapointed as it leaks every time u tilt it or upside down. its very nice how you can put the top on for the handle lefty or righty! so thats built for left and right. The stanley cup is very sturdy but easy to stratch. which i dont like. and mine dented when it slighty barely hit the wall but other things overall 4 stars. thank you for reading if u did so",
