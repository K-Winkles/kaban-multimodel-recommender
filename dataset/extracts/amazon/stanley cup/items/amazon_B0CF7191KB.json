This mug has quickly become my go-to for staying hydrated on the go. The vacuum insulation keeps my drinks at the perfect temperature for hours, whether it's a piping hot coffee or an ice-cold beverage.The stainless steel construction not only ensures durability but also gives it a sleek and stylish look. The navy color adds a touch of sophistication, making it a versatile accessory for any occasion. The size is just right \u2013 large enough to hold a substantial amount of liquid but still fits comfortably in my hand and cup holders.The addition of the straw is a game-changer. It makes sipping easy and mess-free, and the fact that it's reusable is a bonus for the environment. The lid seals tightly, preventing any spills, and the straw is a breeze to clean.YETI's attention to detail and commitment to quality are evident in every aspect of this mug. While the price may be a bit higher than some alternatives, the performance and durability justify the investment. If you're looking for a reliable, stylish, and functional travel mug, the YETI Rambler 35 oz Straw Mug is worth every penny. Five stars without a doubt!",

No, I\u2019m not Turing it upside down to see if the water leaks\u2026 all of them leak, let\u2019s be real. As far as the suction however, it\u2019s very strong and won\u2019t wiggle loose. The straw is nice and thick. Not flexible and has a ring around the end of one side so in case it does knock over, you\u2019re not losing your straw with it. When filled it is a bit heavy but hey, it\u2019s just a weapon in disguise lol!",
