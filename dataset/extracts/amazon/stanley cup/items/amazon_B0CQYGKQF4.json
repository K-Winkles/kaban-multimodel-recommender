They are easy to attach and remove, so you can switch them up depending on your mood. The silicone boot is also a great addition, as it provides extra grip and protection for your cup.I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the straw included in the set. It is made of durable material and is the perfect size for any cup. The sticker accessories are also a fun addition, allowing you to personalize your cup even further.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the SnugMaker Stanley Cup Accessories 63 Pcs set.

                "reviewText": "The boot and charms were what mostly drew me into ordering these, but I love the entire accessory package. The stickers are lovely and I'm definitely going to put them to use, just perhaps not on my tumbler. I appreciate the straw options as well, they are sturdy and indeed match the diameter of the original Stanley straw for my 40 oz tumbler. Everything is exactly as pictured and comes packaged in a nice little box that meant I could safely store them away without worrying about using plastic bags or other such methods. My only gripe is the chain being silver when I'd have preferred a gold or rose gold. Not enough to dock any points because the chain itself works as intended and holds up well. I think these are a terrific value overall and I would recommend them.",
