                "reviewText": "The Lokass Stanley Quencher Carrier fits my 40oz Stanley very well. The color is not cream it's pinkish with cream trim.. it's pale in person, not super pink at all. The phone pocket will fit my Note 9 large phone with a phone cover on it but the zipper on the carrier would be difficult to close. It's really fine because I would want easy access to my phone and it it's secure for sure. There is a pocket for cash or credit cards and extra clips to keep my keys handy. The strap has a padded shoulder piece that slides and it's also adjustable. This carrier is very cute and seems well made. It will be easier for me to take along my large Stanley cup for sure. One thing to keep in mind is that the cup doesn't stand easily when in this carrier due to the padded fabric it's made from. I ordered it to carry so that's not an issue for me. I'm happy to have this item.",
