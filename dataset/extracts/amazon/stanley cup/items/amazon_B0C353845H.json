                "reviewText": "This tumbler has increased my water intake 100%. It holds ice so well, I fill it up with \u201cnugget\u201d ice at work before leaving at the end of the day. When I wake up the next morning, it still has over half the ice (11+ hours). The color is absolutely beautiful and screams aesthetic. I bought a little silicone boot for the bottom to prevent chipping the coating , I would recommend you do the same. It fits perfectly in my little car\u2019s cup holders. The silicone straw was a must for me as, not sure about you guys, but I don\u2019t look half the time when grabbing a cup for a drink and about knock my teeth out with normal straws. Also, the straw comes apart so it\u2019s super easy to clean. The handle is comfortable to hold and feels sturdy. I\u2019ve had this cup fall over a few times but the leakage is minimal. Of course with a tumbler straw, any liquid therein is gonna come out; simple physics.. the little airflow hole at the top also does leak if it falls over, but not a huge deal. I don\u2019t have a Stanley, so can\u2019t offer a comparison. Overall, this was definitely worth the purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I have small hands (seriously they haven't grown much since kindergarten and I'm 43 now). I thought this would be cumbersome to hold but it isn't. I find it very comfortable and not too heavy for my wrists. It is extremely easy to take apart and clean all pieces individually. I have washed it in the dishwasher multiple times and have not noticed any issues (still keeps water cold). The flexible silicone straw is very comfortable and makes it easy to drink out of (especially if the cup is on the counter and your hands are messy from cooking). I have only had water in this cup and the ice stays for a good amount of time (no, I haven't timed it). I was hesitant to purchase this based on size (40 oz) and have found that I am drinking more water due to its ease of use. That's a big win in my book. I will say that I have a tendency to fill cup a bit too full and it does have water come out of the top (from the base of the straw) but that is my fault for filling it too full. The other downside is that it gets a bit top heavy when the water is low. All in all, I use it everyday and am so happy with it. My husband even asked me to get him one (in a different color). He is very happy with his as well. We have never had a Stanley to compare this to but my parents do and they say the Hydroflask lid is easier to open.",

                "reviewText": "I originally had a Stanley that I used every day and loved it.... until news broke that they contain lead. After doing some research, I found this Hydroflask tumbler. Hydroflask initially used the same lead sealing pellet that Stanley did, but changed their engineering process several years ago (2013-2015!) when it was first brought to their attention by consumers. I was impressed with Hydroflask's response to making a clean, toxic-free product and how well they respect their consumers. This mug also works better than my Stanley did... Stanley's leak when you tip them over, this does not. This fits well in cupholders and keeps drinks nice and cold for over 24 hours. This also is more aesthetically pleasing than a Stanley, the screws bolting the handle to the tumbler are covered and this makes it easier to clean. I'm really impressed with this mug and replaced my daughter's Stanley with this as well!",

But, after two weeks I\u2019m noticing that the ice melts much quicker so overnight my water is not very cold. This may not be an issue for some but I find myself replenishing ice more frequently than with my Stanley. As for leakage and spilling, I\u2019ve purchased little stoppers you fit over the straws on Amazon and that solves the problem for any water bottle with a straw. It\u2019s a nice product, love the flexible straw, a little less expensive than Stanley, but Stanley to me is top of the line.",

I was told it was chewable but I don't usually chew on my straws so can't confirm or deny this.It does leak a little.

Lamentablemente, el producto que recib\u00ed lleg\u00f3 en condiciones inaceptables, mostrando da\u00f1os notorios y golpes en la parte inferior. Esperaba un est\u00e1ndar de calidad y durabilidad mucho m\u00e1s alto de parte de una marca tan reconocida.Adem\u00e1s, me gustar\u00eda resaltar que la espera de tres semanas para la entrega solo a\u00f1adi\u00f3 a la frustraci\u00f3n de recibir un producto defectuoso. Este tipo de experiencia socava la confianza en su marca y sus productos.Espero que puedan tomar medidas inmediatas para rectificar esta situaci\u00f3n.",

                "reviewText": "This was the coup of the year. Hydro Flask doesn't seem to have these available at any of their preferred distributors yet in Canada - you'd have to order them from the states, and that cost adds up fast.My partner is a huge fan of Hydro Flask and wanted one of these travel tumblers with handle and flexible straw that she'd seen online - but I was having zero luck. I found this by chance when looking for it at other retailers on Google Shopping, and grabbed it instantly. I'm glad I did.Build quality is fantastic. Heavy, thick stainless steel, tight tolerances on the lid fitting, and a good size handle that's comfortable to hold. This thing is rock-solid, and way bigger than I thought it would be (see cat for scale). The flexible straw is ingenious - there's a rigid plastic straw inside that connects into the flexible silicone upper straw, so you're not experiencing any problems with suction inside, but can bend the upper straw section to drink from any angle.Some reviews say you need to be careful of spills or leaking. This has not been our experience. My partner has dropped and knocked this thing over multiple times so far and it still looks brand new, and hasn't spilled a drop. Rock. Solid.The colour is a bit more blue than the pictures show, but it's really nice.Highly reccomend.",
