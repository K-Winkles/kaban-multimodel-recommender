The honest review is they both have pros, and both keep the water cold, but I prefer the Stanley. The Stanley has a better feel in my hand, is slimmer so it fits in my cup holder. I like that the lid twists on and not snaps in so no leaking. Glad I bought the Stanley, and I love the old school green.",

This momma gets 40 ounces of ice cold water for almost 2 days! (Dependent upon my refilling abilities.) It washes well, both by hand or by dishwasher. The handle is great as I have issues with my grip and typing away my life 40 hours a week. The color is gorgeous! It even fits in my \u201cmom your car is old\u201d 2015 Chevy Malibu cupholders without issue. 10/10 recommend for your work from home hydration needs.",

I thought it would arrive having just the cup in a shipping package. I was surprised to find that it was packaged in an authentic Stanley tumbler box, the Stanley tumbler itself was wrapped in Stanley labeled gift paper and there was a paper label that surrounded the cup. I love the soft texture of the matte finish, and the Dune color was absolutely stunning. I ordered accessories separately to boss it up. I am extremely happy with my purchase, as it was a birthday gift to myself.",
