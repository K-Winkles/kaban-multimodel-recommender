                "reviewText": "We bought the 40z cup in pink and blue for my mom. She\u2019s a driver and her job usually requires her to be on the go all day in vehicles without air conditioning. This cup has worked great so far for her. First of all, she loves the color. We got it in pink, but we made the mistake of dishwashing it, so it\u2019s lost a little bit of it\u2019s color, but still is pretty vibrant, nonetheless. I\u2019d definitely recommend gently hand washing. It\u2019s a perfect size. It fits sung in not only her car cup holder, but in the cupholder on her bus. Best of all, the insulation works great. It keeps her water cold for the entirety of a 6-8 hour work day, even when it\u2019s warm. It hasn\u2019t leaked or spilled so far. She also loves that it comes with a straw, which is perfect for water, and a spout, which is perfect for iced coffee and tea.The only minor downside is the weight of the cup, which is to be expected, given that it\u2019s 40 oz. and made of stainless steal. However, the handle on the side helps a great deal with this problem. The lid can also be pretty difficult to twist off sometimes, if you tighten it too much. We\u2019ve learned how to easily get it to come off though, by running the lid under warm water.Overall, the cup is a great value and is quite effective for its affordable price point.",

                "reviewText": "Edit: Soon after I bought this mug, I received a postcard in the mail offering me a $20 gift card if I wrote a review for this product, and email them my transaction number. I had already reviewed this mug, and followed the instructions. Two months later and I've never received the promised gift card, nor any further communication from them. Is this even legal? Feels pretty scammy to me.-Also, one of the lids randomly had the slider break. I would buy a replacement lid if I knew where to find one.-------------------------------------I bought one for my myself, green and pink, and then my husband wanted one for work, so we got him the blue and white. His ice lasted all day in 98\u2070+ heat. He closes the lid, but I use a straw. I'm home all day, and it's great to have ice cold lemon water any time of the day or night. My ice lasted 16 hours, even with the lid opened for the straw. We stopped buying bottled water, so I started drinking from a crystal goblet, which made my water nice and cold. The problem was that I had to refill it so many times in a day. I kept running out of ice, too. This mug is just the size that's convenient for me. Now, when I wake up in the middle of the night and want a sip of water, it's cold and refreshing.I don't think the ice will last as long as they say, but it lasts a lot longer than any similar mugs or thermoses I've ever owned. It's leak-proof when the lid is closed. It holds a lot of liquid and ice. It's so easy to clean! It goes right into the dishwasher, which is great! The big surprise came when I hand-washed it as soon as it arrived. I was able to get my hand all the way in, to the very bottom, to clean it! It even fits perfectly into the cup holder if our car. The lid is easy to remove with the extra lip for leverage. I also like that the lid is clear, so I know exactly what's in the mug. I am so happy with this purchase. If you're interested in getting one, do it. For this price, you can't go wrong. All the other ones this size cost more, and don't have all the great features. Stay hydrated, friends!",

The trawlers that come with it are amazing - stainless for hot and plastic for cold - I use silicone straws for both and when moving in the car I can just close the lid on the straw so there are no leaks.This mug is half the price of a Stanley and prettier.it keeps my water cold all day long and my coffee hot for hours. I find that the lid closes so tight I can close the opening and turn it upside down and nothing comes out! I love this cup and I only say it\u2019s a bit heavy, and it takes a little maneuvering to close the lid so the straw allows for right- handed usage. But once you figure it out it\u2019s minor. I fully recommend this cup!",
