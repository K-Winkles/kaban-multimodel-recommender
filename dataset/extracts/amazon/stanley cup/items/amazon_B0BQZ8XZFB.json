So far so good - I like not needing multiple lids, and the cup keeps drinks cold or warm just as well as other top brands and seems easy enough to clean. Just be aware there will still be some leakage around the straw or coffee hole if you hold the cup upside down or walk with the cup bouncing around. The cups is definitely less prone to liquid splashing out fromAround the straw then another popular tumbler I have. I like the color, and the handle is nice. My only concern is how gross the rubber rings around the lid will get - I have not had this long enough to know how that is going to go. Overall though my new fave cup.",

                "reviewText": "This was a gift (sort of) and I really like this Stanley insulated cup! These are all the rage now but I can understand why. I have the 30 oz rose quartz and it's a lovely soft pink color. It is a very pretty cup. I tested it with ice and water and there was still a little ice after almost two full days and nights. It's dishwasher safe although I would only put it in the top rack. It's spill-resistant (will drip a little if turned over), not spill-proof, but that works for my uses. I love the handle and the rotating top that allows use of a straw (included), regular drinking, or closed positions. It fits car cupholders which is nice. I also kind of like that it's a brand that has been around since your grandparents' time. Who expected these to become so popular?Stanley also makes a larger 40 oz size in the same style, but that one would be larger than I need. The price was the regular list price here, not some scalper's price, although it did take a couple of weeks for it to ship. Love my stylish Stanley!",

                "reviewText": "I wasn't sure what the hype was surrounding these cups, but when I decided to purchase one - I understand. The 30oz is a good size for me - easy for on the go. The handle is sturdy and easy to grasp. My Stanley has tipped over and there was no leaking - the lid has a tight twist on top. The straw has a tight fit as well, but one can also swivel the top to use without the straw - still no leaking :) I have found that my ice water stays cold up to 10 hours with ice still in the cup. Have not used for hot product, yet, so can not speak to that. Just purchased a new auto and I took my Stanley with me to be sure it was a good fit. (photo shown) These cups are a little pricey compared to others, however, with the quality and durability, well worth it",
