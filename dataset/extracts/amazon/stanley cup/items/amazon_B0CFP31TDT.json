After purchasing several and being disappointed, they end up on a shelf in the pantry, and I'm back to buying bottled water. I saw this one recently and after watching several video reviews, I decided to give this one a try. I'm so glad I did! I absolutely love this water bottle! It's easy to clean, easy to fill, perfect design for drinking (no water running down your chin or up your nose!). I love the handle, lid holder and the variety of colors available. Actually, I love everything about the bottle! Finally, no more bottled water for me!!!",

My only issue with it is that the outside scuffs really easily, and when there is dirt on the outside it is REALLY hard to get it off. There was some small scuffage when I got the bottle and I wasn't able to get it off completely after scrubbing for 30 minutes. If you're someone that really cares about the appearance (I don't, really) then I wouldn't recommend this particular bottle. Otherwise, it's a really great buy!",
