The blue part is hard plastic, the white is soft silicon, making it easier to pop the ice lolly out. I've made orange ice lollies using orange juice only, the children who like and dislike orange loved it! I chose these moulds because I thought the small size means quick eating meaning minimal mess. However, it melts quickly and does get messy especially with younger kids who lick really slow. Overall, I love it so much.",

This mold helps make the absolute perfect size popsicles that i can customize the flavors of. Its easy to clean and they come out perfect every time!",
