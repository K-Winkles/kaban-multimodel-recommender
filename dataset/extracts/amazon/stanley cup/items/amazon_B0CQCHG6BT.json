The top part of our Stanley cup lid that snaps into the middle of the lid and rotates to close it broke, so there was just a hole in the middle of the lid and we couldn't close it. We added this kit's lid stopper, straw, and straw stopper, and it's almost leak proof. A couple of tiny drops escape from around the straw, but it's totally worth it. We tried getting a third party replacement lid before trying this stopper kit, and this kit works a million times better.",

Unfortunately, this product fell short. The straw's material felt flimsy and cheap, a stark contrast to the durable feel of my original straw. Upon first use, I noticed it had a strange, chemical-like taste, which was quite off-putting and raised concerns about its safety and the materials used. Moreover, the straw's length was oddly mismatched for the mug, making it either too long or too short, which was frustrating. This made for an awkward drinking experience.",

Each set includes 6 Straws, 4 straw covers,4 spill stoppers and 4 leak stoppers, 1 cleaning brush, The straws are like 12 inches long and work great with 30 & 40 oz tumblers.

                "reviewText": "I really like this 6 Pack Replacement Straw & 2 Set Spill Stopper Compatible with Stanley 30 40 oz Cup Tumbler Include Cleaning Brush, Reusable Leak Proof Kit for Stanley Cup Accessories, Clear. The straws are easy to use and more mouth friendly than glass or metal. The stoppers work well with my variety of tumblers, and make even a couple of the cheaper ones leak proof. The replacement straws fit all my 30 & 40 oz tumblers.",
