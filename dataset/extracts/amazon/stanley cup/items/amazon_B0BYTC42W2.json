I got this and it works great! The ice I put in the tumbler with water lasts for over a day!I agree with the reviews that the straw it comes with does suck, but I purchased those stanley straws and it works great.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The straw in the listing is straight and looks sturdy. It is extremely curved and flimsy, to the point where it\u2019s ridiculous. I included a photo of what the straw looked like when completely touching the bottom. The plastic underneath the straw hole will scrape up the plastic straw. The straw will not last very long as it bends in half easily. At first I didn\u2019t even know you could turn the part on the top so you could sip out of it because it\u2019s extremely hard to slide around It hurt my hands after because of the force required. Luckily, I\u2019d rather just use straws so it won\u2019t be an issue for me. The lid does not leak, but will still drip near the straw spout area even with the straw inside. The straw hole has rubber bits to prevent leaking but it still can if tipped too far, which I\u2019m not surprised that\u2019s normal. The rubber part in the straw hole opening sprays you with water if you move the straw up with your mouth, which isn\u2019t pleasant. Overall I like this cup and will be purchasing better straws, but I wish I just splurged and bought a Stanley because the quality difference shows. I may return it and purchase a different one.",
