It isn't inexpensive; but it does keep me from so easily forgetting my water bottle, so it saves me having to buy a new one! LOL It is truly convenient, adds a little fun style & color, and makes the bottle more easily identifiable. It's great for taking my quality metal bottle on hikes, long walks and day trips with added convenience. Additionally, the detachable hook means that I can easily attach the bottle to my backpack, purse, stroller, etc. I'm pleased with this silicone strap in both appearance, comfort, and versatility.",

                "reviewText": "Installation was easy, just stretch it like a rubber band over the top and past the lid, then clip the handle onto the band. It fits my Simple Modern 40 oz Trek Tumbler perfectly. The handle strap is thick and comfortable to hold. My main concern is that even when only 2/3 full of ice and water, the band shifts up a little under the weight of the bottle. In person it\u2019s easy to see the stress point on the rubber band by the clasps. Also, the claps themselves are quite thin, I have thicker clasps on keychains which don\u2019t have to support as much weight. Overall, it works for now, but I don\u2019t feel confident that this will last long for me. I recommend it if you don\u2019t keep your water bottle too full or packed with ice.",
