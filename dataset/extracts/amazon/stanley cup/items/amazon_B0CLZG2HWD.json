                "reviewText": "This snack tray is made from a pretty good silicone material. Seems to be durable(time will tell). It fits my 30oz Stanley perfectly. The fit is snug but not too snug that it makes it hard to get on and off. It holds a good amount of snacks. This is a convenient product. It is easy to clean. I am taking off 1 star because product description states that the color is beige white BUT it is more of a pale yellow. This would be 5 stars all day long if the color was accurate. Other than this, the product is great.",

My only suggestion is don't tilt your drink cup towards you when you're drinking. You may spill your snacks!",
