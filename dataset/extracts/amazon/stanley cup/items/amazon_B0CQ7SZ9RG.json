These fit great on wide straws that you typically purchase in addition to the tumbler (or whatever cup you have), however, these are a bit to loose on the regular straws that typically come with tumblers. They will still sit on it if it\u2019s in your cup and will protect your straw, they just aren\u2019t form fitting so, for example, if your cup gets knocked over, these toppers will fall off the straw.Overall, other than that, these are great toppers and very cute.",

If your coworkers, friends or family all use tumblers that look a lot like yours, these straw toppers are a fun way to make yours stand out from the crowd. My personal favorites are the turtle, seal and shark.Fit is a little loose on most straws, but they still stay on without falling off. Get this assortment and share a few with your family and friends!",

                "reviewText": "Yes, I'm freaked out that my straws sitting in a cup on my kitchen counter could be homes for wayward spiders. Imagine putting a straw in your drink and sucking up a sleeping spider. Yes, I got these to cap the straws while stored and while I use them in my travel mugs and soda Beast cups. Super soft squishy sea creatures are cute. They slip over the end of a rubber tipped straw and metal straws easily. They sit tight capped over the end of the straw, allowing no wiggle room. When I leave my cup at the office at night, I cap it and am assured the straw is free and clear to use the next day! It does not prevent your soda from going flat over night. The cup lids are too wide to hold straws tight. This is just a cute great way to keep the end of your straw clean, and adorable.",

Our tumblers are not Stanley, but another brand, a 32oz and a 40oz - these caps fit the straws perfectly. Our son has a 24oz cup, and while the cap is a little looser, it's still snug enough to stay on. These caps are a great idea - both cute and functional!",
