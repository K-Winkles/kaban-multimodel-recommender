                "reviewText": "I bought this for my daughter to take with us on our Spring Break. My daughter\u2019s water tumbler goes everywhere with her and this will allow her to keep her things organized and together. This water bottle carrier bag so cute and well made. The color is so pretty! It has a pocket for your phone and an additional pocket for whatever else you need. My daughter keeps her money, debit card, ID, chapstick and key in the extra packet so it is very roomy. The strap is adjustable to a length that you can wear it as a regular bag or crossbody. It fits my daughters 40 ounce Stanley tumblers and her dupes. The strap is also detachable. I just can\u2019t believe what a great product for such a low price.",
