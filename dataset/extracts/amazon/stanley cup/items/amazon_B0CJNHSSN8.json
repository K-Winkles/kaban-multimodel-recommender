I had previously ordered a similar one from a different vendor, and I had to return it because I had ordered a gray one, but it looked more green than gray and it also had plastic hardware pieces, which made me nervous they\u2019d brake easily. Not only that but the holder only wrapped in between the handle and didn\u2019t stay fully up.I found this one and I decided to order it because it had metal hardware.Upon getting it I realized that it has a little strap that goes over the handle to help it stay up and my phone fits perfectly in the little pocket and not only did it come with a shoulder strap. It also came with a smaller handle strap, which is perfect because I wanted it for the gym. I am so happy that I ordered this one and returned the first one.Highly recommend this one over the other similar ones.",

                "reviewText": "so, i have a stanley 40oz. This definitely fits well to the standard of the cup. Pretty spot on!my one off star though is due to the long strap and the short strap they provide. the short strap is laughable because you might as well hold the stanley with the handle vs the small strap. the large strap, the padding doesn't stay in place and the adjuster on the strap tends to move on it's own, seemingly moving longer on the body, not shorter. it'd be great if they can change the strap. one thing though I'll mention is that although I knocked a point off for the straps' adjustment, my good friend saw it and wanted one, so I ordered another color for her, and this same color for another of her family members. very popular this one. :Dwhat can it hold?stanley 40oz of course, in the big pocket I can fit my iPhone 13 pro, id, stamp card, and a couple of bills, rolled. OR in the big pocket I can put my large portable charger, and in the small space my id, stamp card (like the size and feel of a cc), and the couple of bills.",
