It's so easy to drink through especially with the detachable straw that comes with it. I was worried that it would make a loud slurping noise as some other straw lids do, but this one is almost completely silent. Only negative I have about this is that the handle isn't as comfortable to hold as the original screw-on lid, but it's worth not having to take 10 seconds to screw the lid off every time you want a drink. For the price, this lid is definitely worth it!!",

However I don't want to use (and have to clean) the straws and figured I could just tip the bottle back and drink, but the loop on the lid (which is hard plastic and not soft) will hit your nose. If you are planning to suck the drink up by using the straws I'm sure the lid will work fine. I'm not really happy with the design for my use and am planning to replace this lid with one where the loop pivots out of the way.",
