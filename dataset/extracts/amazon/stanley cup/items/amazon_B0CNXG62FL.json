Additionally, the part that is supposed to go around the handle doesn't fit right because the height between the 30oz & 40oz are not the same so it basically doesn't properly close the velcro underneath.The quality of the actual product is good, and I can imagine it would work great with a 40oz Stanley as that is what it's clearly built for.",
