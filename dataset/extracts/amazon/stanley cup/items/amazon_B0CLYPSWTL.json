                "reviewText": "I have not received this yet, so I am not sure of the total quality yet and will update once I do. These things are typically always in good shape. I believe neoprene must be an easy material to work with. I have a white one and soon a black one. The black one is for my 'tween daughter so hers won't look as dirty as it probably will be!All of these carriers seem to be about the same cost right now, but this one comes with the added fabric coverage/protection of the tumbler as well as the shoulder strap and extra pockets on days you just want to care one thing!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fits more than just Stanley tumblers",
                "reviewText": "I ordered this for my wife's generic craft store 40 oz. insulated tumbler, and it fits just fine. About the only potential drawback to using this with her tumbler is the handle on her tumbler is open at the bottom, making it so that the Velcro strap designed to go through the handle doesn't have anything to keep the tumbler from being pulled out. The pockets are convenient for a phone and items like a keyring, lip balm, etc., and the carry strap adjusts for personal preference in where the tumbler hangs while carrying. I also tried my Hydro Flask 40 oz. tumbler in it, and it also fits nicely.All in all, a good accessory for the tumbler, and if you're one of those that fought hard to get one of the Valentine themed Stanley tumblers that are insanely popular at the time of this writing, this will help protect it when you're out and about with your prize.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars METAL CLIPS",
                "reviewText": "There are SO MANY holders available - why is this one the best??? Because it has metal clips on the shoulder strap. 40 oz tumblers are a bit heavy when they are full and I wanted to make sure I didn\u2019t have to \u201cplay nicely\u201d with mine. This fit\u2019s my tumbler perfectly, doesn\u2019t ride too far up (I hate when coozies get too high and it\u2019s hard to drink without touching them (ewww). This holder sits nicely below the lid line. The pocket is nice to carry stuff around when you\u2019re on vacation at an all-inclusive and works well for stuff in daily life, too. My iPhone 12 Pro fit great and was easy to insert and remove. I recently got a 15 pro max and it does fit but it\u2019s a little snug so not so easy to take in and out.",
