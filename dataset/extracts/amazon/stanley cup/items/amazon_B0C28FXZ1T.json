I did buy it thinking it was the off white looking one that comes with my style cup and matches the lid but it wasn\u2019t! ITS STILL A GREAT STRAW PERFECT SIZE, just doesn\u2019t match my style cup but does match clear lid ones. ALSO, I originally thought the straw was cheaply made and peeling or 3d printed but it\u2019s actually high quality my stupid self just didn\u2019t realize the straw is WRAPPED in plastic that looks like it could be part of the straw! But i highly recommend it works great and doesn\u2019t leave teeth marks or anything if you have kids!! It comes with a bunch and is so worth the price, compared to stanley\u2019s replacement prices.",
