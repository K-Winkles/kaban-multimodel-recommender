I can put ice inside at night and by the end of the next day it is dissolved. It hasn\u2019t even been a whole day. It does keep my drink cold. That was true. And before you ask yes I fill the tumbler with ice all the way to the top with my liquid and it still doesn\u2019t hold for two days as advertised. Overall it is a good item to buy.",
