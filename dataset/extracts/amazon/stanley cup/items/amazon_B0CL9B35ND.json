                "reviewText": "In this set you receive 10 stitch straw covers. Well made, sturdy, durable and super cute. Each one unique. They fit on the straws perfectly, a bit stretchy so They can fit on a range of sizes however, gives a tight snug fit, so you don't have to worry about it leaking or falling off. My favorite one is Lilo kissing stitch and his facial expression. These could make the perfect gift for a stitch lover as well. Love them!",
