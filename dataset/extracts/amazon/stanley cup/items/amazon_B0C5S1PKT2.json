                "reviewText": "I have always used Stanley cups (my dad has had a thermos for longer than my 31 years of life), but with the popularity of this cup the price is a little much, I figured this cup was worth a try.Overall it's a relatively good dupe, but definitely doesn't measure up for the most part. The lid is very finnicky, it must be put on exactly right for a good seal, which is difficult to line up and get the straw opening in a usable spot with the handle, yet at the same time, there's a constant gap between the top of the cup and the bottom of the lid, leaving it open for a failed seal. The photos on the listing do not show that gap, the lid looks flush with the top rim of the cup.Comparing it to the Stanley, it doesn't hold ice anywhere near as long, so it's okay if you're not leaving it long-term or in very warm weather. Will probably return as the lid is just not up to quality. The gap is very concerning that one day it just won't seal anymore, but it's also very annoying to have to fight with the lid every time I fill it. This is cheaper than a Stanley, but still $20 so I'd expect a lid that's easy to put on and gives a good seal.",
