I love the fact it's got a shoulder strap, the neoprene keeps your drink extra insulated and the cup finish protected. At first I was worried I wouldn't love the grey color, but it came I'm so glad I got it. I hides dirt, wear and scuffs. The straw \"cloud\" protector is super cute and tight.This is an overpriced and heavy cup. In order to keep the \"investment\" of it in good shape while still getting good use of it, this neoprene strap is a must. It's got everything I need, although I wish the front pocket was as large as the phone holder for a small card wallet.I would recommend this product to everyone that has this cup.",

It\u2019s made of a flexible rubber material that makes it easy to slip under the tumbler and my cup stands great with it. I got the clear color one and it does not disappoint.",
