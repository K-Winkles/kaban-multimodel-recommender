                "reviewText": "These are nice because of how easy they are to clean, but being clear they show chapstick, mineral buildup, etc and I feel like I have to wash it multiple times a day or it looks dirty. That's not necessarily a bad thing. A few times my cup tipped over or fell on the floor and it dented the straw on the top so it was too rough/uncomfortable to drink out of. I suppose it could be cut or filed to use it further. Luckily it comes in a 4 pack so it wasn't too much of an issue, I just switched straws. Other than being easily damaged, it's a pretty good straw. I'd say worth the money.",
