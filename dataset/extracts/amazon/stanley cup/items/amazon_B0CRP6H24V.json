It's been hard finding a boot for it as the 40 oz boots I have for my other tumblers have been too tall and ran into this smaller one's handle. This one fits perfectly! I have a 40 oz cream boot from another company that I expected this one to be identical to, just shorter. So, yes this one is thankfully shorter, however this one also is a little more orange than my other cream boot. It came folded in half in a zippered bag so it's got a crease down the middle that still, a day later, is visible when it's not on the tumbler. The chemical smell straight out of the bag was noticeable but today it's mostly gone. Overall it does the job and fits well, so I am pleased.",

It also aids in reducing the noise the cup normally makes when you set it down, with the silicone cover the noise is eliminated. The color matches the orchid colored Stanley perfectly. Easy to wash as well.",
