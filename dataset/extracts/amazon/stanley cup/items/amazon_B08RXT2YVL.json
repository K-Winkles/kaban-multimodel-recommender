                "reviewText": "I purchased these for my kids this fall to take to school. Their prior bottles were too small (about 12 oz) and they had to keep refilling them, so we wanted something bigger. I found these and they are PERFECT. The lock + button-to-open feature is secure and there have been NO leaks in the backpack. Since they are steel they don't crack like cheap plastic ones do when the kids toss their backpacks on the ground and we don't use plastics for food or beverages in our house anyway. The best feature is there is no straw to clean. The spout feature make it easier to clean too. I have noticed that the kids are drinking much more water - maybe because the water stays colder or because it's easier to take large gulps compared to a straw. My 12yo says the water tastes much better compared to some we have tried with silicone straws. I bought it on sale on Amazon for $18 each at the time, which I thought was really reasonable for what you get. The Stanley brand is well known for lasting a REALLY long time. Unless plastic parts on the lid break (they haven't yet and they seem really sturdy) I see this bottle being around for years.",

                "reviewText": "I would give it a five star review, but hearing about all the lead talk in the bottom of the thermos made me take away a star because I don't believe any products in 2024 should contain lead... even if it's tucked away and not exposed. The cap potentially could come off on the bottom and they COULD potentially expose someone to lead.As far as the reviews stating the lid hits them on the nose, this is not true at all for me. The lid actually locks into place when you open it and isn't even relying on the spring to hold it. It does not come down at all for me and I really have no complaints about the thermos. Keeps the drinks cold, it's a good size and the locking mechanism and overall functionality is great.",

It's lighter than shown in the pictures but it's just what I wanted, something with a little colour to differ from the White. 110% recommend to anyone looking for a water bottle!",
