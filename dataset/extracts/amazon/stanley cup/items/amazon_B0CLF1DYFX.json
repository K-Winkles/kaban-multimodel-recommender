                "reviewText": "Let's be honest, reusable straws are awesome for the planet, but sometimes I get a little tired of fishing leaves and dust bunnies out of my Stanley tumbler before each sip. Enter these adorable little silicone straw caps! They fit perfectly on my trusty 30oz cup (and I'm guessing they'd work on the 40oz too, based on the description), creating a snug seal that keeps out the gunk without looking bulky or weird.Speaking of cute, these little toppers come in a fun pack of five with different designs, so I can switch things up depending on my mood. They're super easy to pop on and off, even with one hand, which is a lifesaver when I'm wrangling groceries or a particularly wiggly toddler. Plus, they're dishwasher-safe, so cleanup is a breeze.Bottom line? These straw caps are a tiny addition that makes a big difference in my reusable straw experience. They're practical, adorable, and totally worth the price. If you're a Stanley tumbler fan (or just someone who hates straw surprises), definitely give them a try!",

                "reviewText": "These straw toppers are so cute!! They are well made and can be used on a variety of different straws. My daughter uses hers on her Stanley, and I use mine with my Yeti and a metal straw. You can\u2019t beat the price. I chose the smaller pack of 4 and paid just under $4. I\u2019ve seen them much higher elsewhere. The only complaint I have, is that they don\u2019t fit snuggly on the straw (even on the Stanley straw), so it doesn\u2019t make it spill proof. I know that because my daughter had her topper closed and dropped her Stanley in my car and water spilled everywhere. If you\u2019re looking for a waterproof version, this isn\u2019t it. But if you\u2019re just looking to add something cute to your drink and to keep things from getting in your straw ( dust, flies etc), it\u2019s worth it.",
