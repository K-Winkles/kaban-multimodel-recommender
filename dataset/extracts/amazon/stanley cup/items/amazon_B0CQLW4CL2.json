Her company gave a Stanley style cup to all the managers. Unfortunately, they all look the same. So, these charms and straw covers will come in handy. Her name is the only one that starts with an A. That said, the bright pink and gold chain will help her cup stand out in a crowd.",

I never thought I'd see the day that we are dressing up our water cups but here we are. Let's go",
