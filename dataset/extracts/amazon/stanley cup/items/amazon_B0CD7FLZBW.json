There\u2019s a mesh spot inside where your phone would go as well. The front part isn\u2019t zippered, so I\u2019d never put any credit cards or ID inside of there. Where it needs improvements\u2026.. There is not enough room for your phone and water bottle at the same time. The pouch for your phone needs to be wider, and the part for your credit cards should have a zipper.",
