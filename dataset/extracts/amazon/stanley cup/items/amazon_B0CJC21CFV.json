                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I like to walk around the neighborhood as part of my daily routine, so I\u2019m used to go out with a bottle of water, cell phone, wallet, and keys. As you can imagine, the pockets of my shorts are limited and don\u2019t help me so much. Therefore, I liked the profile and features of XIISVINT\u2019s bottle carrier and purchased it right away. I was very pleased when I felt the high quality materials that were used for its fabrication. First, the bottle holder has a very nice space to hold different types of bottles. Further, the phone pocket - which has a gorgeous U.S. flag print - perfectly allows you to also store a wallet, cash, tickets, etc. I liked that the carrier has a very solid hook where I can put my keys as well. After a few days, I had to cleaned the carrier and put it into the washer and it came out perfectly. Based on the above, all these features make this carrier a very versatile product at an incredible price point!",
