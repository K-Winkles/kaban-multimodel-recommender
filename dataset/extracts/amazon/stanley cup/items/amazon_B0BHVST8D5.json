Most impotently, it still fits in my cup holder. I think this is one of the thinner boots I\u2019ve seen. I\u2019ve seen other ones that friends have ordered for their own Stanley & they\u2019re much thicker. So I appreciate how thin this one is without sacrificing protection. Now I don\u2019t have to worry about scratching the bottom of my Stanley in my cup holder/rough surfaces & it\u2019s a lot more quiet when I place it back down on my desk. My only regret is that I didn\u2019t buy this & place it on my Matte 40oz Stanley Quencher when I first bought it because the matte coating is already starting to peel on the bottom. Maybe I\u2019ll older another Matte Stanley & place this one from the start to see if that makes a difference!",

                "reviewText": "I am obsessed with my Stanley tumbler, but we have a glass table, and I was terrified that I would break the table with my cup. This has eased my anxiety! It helps keep my cup from sliding around on uneven surfaces, and also serves as a great built in coaster for wooden tables. I love it so much, that I gave one to my best friend for her cup - and she loves it as well!It fits very snuggly to the bottom of the cup and still easily slides in and out of my car cupholders.",
