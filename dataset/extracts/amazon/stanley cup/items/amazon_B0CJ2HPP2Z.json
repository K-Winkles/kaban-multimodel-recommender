                "reviewText": "I should start by saying I do NOT own a Stanley cup. Upon reading the description I was curious to see if this would work for my 32oz Contigo tumbler. I tend to drop it none stop when I take my daily speed walks. Turns out I was right. The velcro strap is very strong so I was able to strap my tumbler in without any issues and it stayed while I was on my walks. This holder comes with two straps, both can clip on to the holder. One can be used to carry the bottle by hand while the other can be used to carry like a crossbody bag or even over the shoulder. There are 3 pockets on the holder. One on the outside can be used to carry ID/DL (or your entire wallet). The first pocket is deep enough ti hold a small hand towel, a flashlight, and maybe one or two other items. The lower, outer netted pocket works great for keys and it has a clip just above the pocket to clip to your keys so as not to fall out. I am also able to clip my hand sanitizer to it. I'm sure this may work with other water bottles, it would just need to be one on the larger side like the one in my photos. I deducted one star because of how thin the stitching is on the section that connects the bag to the holder. I worry it may come loose eventually. Don't mind the dent in my bottle, this is from a drop on one of my previous walks.",
