The straw that came with my Stanley makes my water taste weird. These straws allow for a very pure flavor, which is what I want. In a taste test of Stanley straw vs replacement straw, everyone said the replacement straws allowed the water to taste better. I clean my straws daily, and with hot water so there is no build up or residue.",

The six-pack ensures that I always have a spare straw on hand, whether I'm at home, at work, or on the go. It's not only an environmentally friendly choice but also a practical one for those who use their Stanley tumblers regularly.Cleaning is a breeze \u2013 the straws are dishwasher safe, and the quality of the material ensures that they withstand multiple washes without losing their integrity. I appreciate the attention to detail in the design, with rounded edges for comfortable sipping and a length that suits both the 40 oz and 30 oz tumblers perfectly.Overall, these replacement straws have exceeded my expectations.

I like that they are completely clear so that it is obvious when there\u2019s something in the straw (no hidden mold!) and there\u2019s a cleaning brush included. No issues with durability either. Worth the money to have a couple of extra straws so I have a straw ready while one is drying completely after cleaning.",
