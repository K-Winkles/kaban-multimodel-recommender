The handle is nice and comfortable, easy to grip and hold, and though the mug itself is nice and solid and durable feeling, it isn't overly heavy feeling either. Keeps the beer nice and cold for long times even with the open face, which is impressive, and can hold a good amount. The steel ring on your lips can take a little getting used to, but it's not really a negative, just not what I'm used to. All in all, would definitely recommend, new favorite for certain!",

                "reviewText": "Excellent quality stein. Honestly I did not expect it to be as good as it was. I ended up testing it by pouring a cold beer into it and letting it sit for over an hour. By hour 5, I almost forgot I poured my beer, went to drink it, and it was still just as cold as when I poured it. Even if it was a little flat, as to be expected after 5 hours. but still nice and cold. Recommend it for both regular drinkers and sippers alike. Stanley quality as expected.Also, the handle was more comfortable than expected, for hard plastic.",

                "reviewText": "When you go to an all-inclusive resort, one suggestion you'll hear over and over is to bring your own tumbler like a Tervis, Bubba, or Yeti. For me, this Stanley Stein may be the perfect mug for all-inclusive travel. Overall, it's a fantastic mug and I highly recommend it.1- Construction: This feels sturdy with a powder-coated exterior, stainless steel interior, and sturdy handle that feels good to hold. Many alternative mugs have a flimsy handle or don't have a handle at all (Tervis).2- Lids: As mentioned in other reviews, the lids for 16oz Tervis Tumblers fit perfectly. I used a non-matching Tervis Travel Lid that I had hanging around and liked it so much that I upgraded to a matching black one. I also purchased a matching Tervis Straw Lid. I have not seen any reviews that mention the straw lid specifically, so I thought it was worth mentioning that it also fits like it was made for it (pictures attached). It would be nice if this came with its own lid, but the Tervis lids are a great alternative and do the job of keeping sand and other debris out of your drink.3- Capacity: For me, 24oz is the right capacity to bring to an all-inclusive resort. It's large enough to fit a generous portion and you don't need to get out of your lounger or the pool too often. But it's not so large to feel embarrassed carrying it around, or that people scoff at it (I'm looking at you 52oz Bubba Keg).4- Shape: I like that it is wider at the bottom than at the top which makes tipping it over just that much harder. Many travel mugs are designed to fit into a cup holder which means they're skinny at the bottom and are more likely to tip over when not in a cup holder. This stein won't fit in a normal cup holder, but that's not what it's made for. If you are looking for something to keep on your desk, this shape is more spill-proof than something that's skinny at the bottom. The interior is wide enough to clean by hand more easily than many other options too.5- Price: This is more affordable than many other options. If you don't care about the color and/or cosmetic damage check the \"New & Used\" items and you may be able to save nearly 14 dollars (which you can use on a matching Tervis lid). I own a hammertone green Stanley travel coffee mug that I love the classic style of. I sometimes wish I had gotten this in the hammertone green color as well, but wasn't willing to spend the extra money on it at the time I purchased the black one on sale.",

                "reviewText": "Very nice mug. The wider base makes it very stable unlike the taller travel mugs. NIce substantial handle for a comfortable grip. Packaging/shipping could have been better as this arrived in a brown envelope with no padding or bubble wrap - fortunately I was outside and was handed it directly by the driver - it would have likely dented if it was dropped on my doorstep.Keeps iced drinks cold for hours. Generous 24 oz capacity is just right.The Tervis Travel Lid for 16 oz tumblers fits perfectly. It also prevents contact with the cold or hot metal lip of the mug while drinking, if that bothers you. The plastic feels better for me.Not so much for the fit of the XccMe 30oz Skinny Tumbler Replacement Lids that another reviewer recommended - those are a smidge too small and are thus not secure and allow leakage past the rubber gasket while drinking with the lid on - but I guess it is good enough to help keep drinks colder or warmer for longer periods than without a lid.",
