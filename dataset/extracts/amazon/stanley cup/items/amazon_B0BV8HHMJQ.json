I pour it around 7:30 and typically still have a bit around 1:30 to finish off (20 ounce tumbler). It\u2019s still warm at that point. I have the pale blush color and was worried the coffee dribbles would stain it since it is so light colored. Not at all!! I would definitely buy more colors. The quality is exceptional. I was looking for a tumbler that would not only keep my coffee hot (a must), but would also be leakproof. I tested this out by tipping it every which way over the kitchen sink. Not a single drop came out! It is a skinny tumbler and fits in my car cup holder perfectly. It has a no skid rubber bottom and doesn\u2019t tip over or slide around. I am completely sold on this tumbler and couldn\u2019t be happier with my purchase!!",

                "reviewText": "My daughter wanted to give me the Quencher just like hers but I\u2019m a coffee person so I\u2019m trying this. I actually have the StanleyxStarbucks coffee tumbler for 2 years now before all this Stanley hoopla but haven\u2019t used it yet since I thought it\u2019s only for cold drinks and it\u2019s just 16oz (need at least 20oz coffee in the morning). Anyways, my first time using this at this moment I\u2019m writing this review and I like it. It\u2019s slim, perfect for my short fingers. Love the mouthpiece where I can rest my lips without worrying the area is exposed to any possible dust or dirt and the flip goes all the way to the back without flipping back to your nose. Easy to clean w a bottle brush. Keeps hot for hours Hopefully this will be better w my many Starbucks coffee tumblers that the flips breaks all the time. I loved my Starbucks coffee tumblers since the inside lining doesn\u2019t scuff after multiple use w hot drinks, doesn\u2019t leak and keeps hot drinks for hours but just the flips keeps on breaking and they're un replaceable. And hopefully the ring inside won\u2019t loosen like my Hydroflask coffee tumbler before. I just wished this comes w Cherry red color. Thank you Amazon for shipping it w a box and a bubble wrap inside. I was skeptical after reading many reviews of them receiving w dents. I\u2019ll give my follow up review if things will turn out opposite from what I expected from this.",

When I ordered it it came with a small dent, but I did get a used one and I don\u2019t really mind it. It is also very sleek and fits well in the small cup holder on my backpack. My only gripe is that it is a little on the expensive side, so i would get a used one if you don\u2019t mind any small dents/scratches. Other than that it is a very high quality bottle and I use it all the time.",

Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this Stanley Aero-Light transit bottle for ease of transport, but I have found that it also keeps my cold drinks cold for many hours without being a heavyweight and does not leak during transport. I have been using a very heavy 32-oz Hydro Flask wide mouth bottle for a couple of years, which I LOVE except for the weight when I travelled. I couldn't find a place to store the large Hydro Flask in my car where it wouldn't roll around or my grandkids wouldn't hurt themselves with Gigi's heavy water bottle. This Stanley Aerolight Transit Bottle has answered my needs. It is lightweight, doesn't leak or spill all over me when the car or train are moving, and it keeps the ice water cold. I love the ease of carrying it in my backpack or storing it in a cup holder. Although I still LOVE my 32-oz Hydro Flask, this Stanley Aerolight Transit Bottle in the Grapefruit color is working out GREAT! I first saw it advertised on Good Morning America in 2023 and made my purchase because of their recommendations. I am pleased with my purchase and highly recommend this product.",
