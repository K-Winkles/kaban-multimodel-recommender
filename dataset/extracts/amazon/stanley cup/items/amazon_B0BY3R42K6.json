                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Just about perfect",
                "reviewText": "Since I keep my mugs for a long time (and only have 3), I spent a bit extra to get the pretty Nightfall color. Color aside, I LOVE this mug.PROS:-- (TEMP)This actually did keep my coffee hot for a long time. I got the mug at 1:32 pm & took about 20 minutes to wash it out, boil some water to pre-heat the mug, and make coffee. I was still drinking hot coffee - not piping hot but still very hot - at around 7:10 pm. The 2nd night I had it, I put hot water in it to prime it for the morning & left it closed all night. When I opened it in the morning, the water was still warm enough. If it had been coffee, I would have been able to enjoy it.-- (COMPARED TO) I really like the press & sip feature. I think that has a lot to do with how the mug keeps the coffee so hot for so long. I have a 160z Klean Kanteen and an 8oz Yeti mug. The problem with the K.K. is that the lid is finicky & can wear rough so that after a while the coffee stops retaining heat and starts leaking if you don't get the lid on absolutely perfectly. I love that cup but hate having to clean the lid. The Yeti is super cute and does a decent job but, again, the seal isn't tight enough. That's fine for 8 ounces of coffee but this 16oz Stanley is what I need most days.-- (CLEANING) I saw reviews saying the lid on this is hard to clean. I don't find that to be a problem at all. The twist-off bottom is super easy to remove and replace. I can see all of the insides as I run soap and water through it. To finish, I turn the lid upside down over the mug and pour hot water into it, then drain it with the trigger. I don't have to soak this lid overnight to break up hidden creamer gunk.-- (GRIP & TRAVEL) I have smaller hands & this mug is very easy for me to grip in one hand and walk around with. When I was deciding on a color, I thought about getting the Matte Black one since it might have more grip. The one I have is not matte and the grip is no problem because of the mug's circumference. Also, this fits in vehicle cup holders where my other 2 mugs do not.--(LEAKPROOF) One of the most important things is that this is totally leakproof. As other reviewers show in videos, I turned this upside down to check its leakage & there were NONE. When I was taking photos of the bottom of the mug to post, it was filled with scorching hot water. I left it upside down *on my bed's beautiful comforter* and there were no accidents. This is good because I am a klutz and usually tip my mugs over as I sit with them on my writing desk or, worse, my lap desk when I'm sitting on the bed or couch. This didn't spill when I tested that out. As for packing this around inside of bags, I don't normally put mugs into my purse, cases, or backpacks but as long as this is placed well for the trigger not to depress, it should be fine.CONS:The biggest thing for me, since I have been trying to support American workers, is that this is made in China. I didn't realize that until I got the mug. That might be a deal-breaker for some people. I usually check this before I buy but I just assumed... I like the workmanship of the mug enough to let this slide.-- Because I prime the mug with hot water, I was able to notice that the silver part at the top right under the lid gets REALLY hot to the touch. That's not a huge problem because I hold the mug's middle area. However, if a kid should touch this, they might get a little owie.-- You have to be careful when sipping from this because it does keep the coffee just as hot as it comes out of the pot. As long as you realize that, you won't be surprised and singe your lips.OVERALL:I do like the mug so much. I'm especially happy with the color and design. It's classic, nice-looking, and solid-feeling. I have put my Klean Kanteen in storage because I am just keeping it for its sentimental value. The one thing I have not tested (and hope never to) is how durable this is. I saw a couple of other reviews with pictures showing bad denting. I'm not sure how that happened because this thing feels pretty sturdy. I don't care about the eventual damage to the color, as long as the mug still works. I am going to be checking on that \"lifetime warranty\" though. Just in case.By the way: I suggest you make sure to take a photo of the bottom of your mug. That is where all the info is that you will need in case you need to make a warranty claim. I include a photo from the Stanley site (https://support.stanley1913.com/en/support/solutions/articles/69000751574-where-do-i-find-my-product-info-) about finding the product info & notice that my info on the item was etched around the outermost edge of the bottom of the cup & the mfg qtr and yr were in the middle. Hope this helps.",

                "reviewText": "I like to start off with the limited space to fill in for coffee. I have another 16oz in another brand/cheaper and comparing them well it seems to fit in more liquid and works about the same. My only dislike about this would be its smaller than you\u2019d assume. If that\u2019s not an issue with you then go ahead just be careful estimating how much water and milk you put into this for coffee, but if not you can always purchase a larger size. It all depends if you\u2019re a person like me and prefers the most space because you drink a lot of something then this is perfect. If you drink smaller proportions and looking for a good smaller container this it it for you! I do know it works just as good/easy as described! Doesn\u2019t leak or spill out in between turns and shakes. Keeps everything cold or HOT!I can see this lasting my partner for a good few years, various colors are a bonus for this purchase. Overall, me and my hubby are very happy with this purchase and it\u2019s not complicated to wash. I recommend for work, home, going out on trips with this product and hopefully you\u2019ll like it as much as we do!",
