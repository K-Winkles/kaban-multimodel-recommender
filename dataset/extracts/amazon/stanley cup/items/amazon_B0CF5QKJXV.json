                "reviewText": "I liked that this product came with a straw cover, pockets, and Velcro closure. I got the 40oz option for my Reduce cup. The pink color looks great too! It fits snug on the cup and goes a tad bit high in the lips of the cup itself, which does not bother me. I mainly use the straw to drink from it. I know it was made for cups like Stanley\u2019s. The bag sometimes needs to be pulled up more often, again, my handle is not like a Stanley\u2019s so it may ride down. And the it\u2019s made it less car cup holder friendly due to the increase in size.Pockets so far - I have a slim snack bar in the big one and a tube of lotion and chapstick in the smaller one. It\u2019s made it kind of bulky and awkward. And I haven\u2019t added keys to the carabiner yet because of this.Strap - I\u2019m larger on top and the size of the band works for me comfortably when using as a cross body. The strap will fit around the waist but with how bulky the pockets and the cup are, I\u2019m not confident it would work well to walk around with on the hip.My only complaint with this is the smell of the inside of the bag was strong and smells like balsamic vinegar. Even after airing it out in the garage for a few days, it can still be smelled, with less potency.",

Has a clip to attach keys, a pocket big enough for her phone, and a second pocket that holds credit cards/cash, etc. Bith pockets have zippers, for added security. It comes in a box, and it did have a slight neoprene smell, but that dissipated quickly. This is a great grab-and-go option when you don\u2019t want to juggle a purse with your travel cup. Very happy with this purchase!",
