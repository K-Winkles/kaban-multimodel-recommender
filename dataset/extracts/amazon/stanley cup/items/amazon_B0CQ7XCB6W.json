                "reviewText": "I bought my Stanley cup dupe tumbler, and this accessory pack, at the same time and for the same purpose: drinks and snacks out on the boat this summer. Of course I tried it out right away when it arrived (nice for car snacking too), and can say I am pleased in general.The bowl can hold a good amount (e.g., is deep enough for mini pretzels, peanut butter-filled pretzel puffs, etc.), even with the lid on. I cannot comment on whether my dupe tumbler (SipX) is the exact same dimensions as a Stanley cup, but I will say that on my cup there is a bit of space between the cup and bowl inside (so that the bowl sits at a slight cant, with the handle side higher). This is remedied though by putting the handle strap on underneath the bowl--then the handle strap fills in the little gap and makes it all sit more snugly.I was worried with the design that the handle strap would slip off with a full heavy cup, since it doesn't have anything to catch it, but it is very secure. This is great when you need multiple hands or don't want to look for the cup's handle when the big bowl is in the way, however, I wish it were a bit shorter--because it is made of silicone, it stretches out a good bit with a full cup pulling on it (I could almost put it on my shoulder like a little purse strap).I am very pleased to have the little straw cap, but the other leak-proof accessory pieces I won't be using. Only the round one (for around the straw on the inside) fits on my cup's lid style (which has just one hole, for the straw). Using this does in fact make the entire thing completely leak-proof (tested it out with a full tumbler of water), but I won't actually use it, because it also makes drinking from the straw create a powerful vacuum inside so that drawing liquid up is tough, and the whole cup shudders from the vacuum release when you let go. It may work much better on a different lid style, though.The bowl comes with a lid (main reason #1 why I chose this style over other offerings). I like the lid, but you have to meticulously pull the lip around the bowl edge to secure it. This would be useful traveling back and forth, but not for taking it on and off for frequent snacking. To fix that, the rim of the bowl should have been made solidly round (not flexible, foldable silicone) so the bowl had something more to grip. However, I am still glad I have the lid. The other main reason I selected this version over other offerings is because it is plain, not cutesy--the straw cap is just a cap, the colors are neutral. That's what I wanted!I do like having the silicone boot for the cup. It is shallower than others I have seen, but it stays on (and happens to be the exact same shade of gray as my cup).Overall, I do recommend this set if you have one of these big keep-it-cold tumblers and want the snack bowl accessory.",

I couldn\u2019t ever get the lid to the tray sealed closed, and the piece that connects to the handle barely fit the bottom of my 40oz Stanley, much less the top where it is supposed to go. The accessories are nice, I had just hoped they would fit properly.",

The set comes with everything except the straw and the cup. You get the bowl, of course, but it also has a lid, which I haven't seen on other bowls of this type- handy to minimize spills. It also has a straw protector, a rubber thingy to put on the bottom of your cup to help keep it from skidding across the table, and a handle you can set up, with hardware. Very well thought out and presented. I could wish, however, for a bit more in the way of instructions, because it took me a while to figure out what each part was and where it went. Good value.",
