The only drawback is when you're washing it. You handwash it and dry it, the fibers of your towel are going to stick to the silicone, you put this in the dishwasher and it dries with spots on it. No win win there. I'm just glad there are so many more upsides, like the fit and the ease for travel. This is perfect for road trips and traveling on a plane. I have a plastic snack bowl as well, but for travel I definitely prefer the silicone one because it's a lot easier to pack.",

                "reviewText": "The silicone snack ring fits the top of the cup well. The straw holder is the right size for the straw. I don't love the straw holder design- wish it was more unisex than a flower cup, but like that is cup-ception of a cup with a straw on a cup with a straw. The snack chopsticks are too small for my fingers. Even putting them at the last knuckle, they're made for petite hands, but they have a kawaii bunny so I imagine they're perfect for teens. Easy to clean the snack tray and that's why you're buying this silicone one instead of others.",

                "reviewText": "I really don't like the color of this snack bowl. I understand the listing says this color is \"oange\", but thought orange was implied. However, the color is more of a pastel peach/mustard yellow. With that being said, it DOES work as advertised. it slips right on to the lid and sits securely hugging the cup handle. Mine came with a plastic chopstick set that has little finger... handles? on the back, made for small kids (or adults like me that don't know hw to use chopsticks properly Lol.) But I can see how they would be useful when eating cheetos/cheezeballs to keep your fingers clean. I did not, however, receive the brown bear straw cover. Foe the price I'd expect to receive all items listed, and honestly, I'm still having a really hard time getting over the terrible color. But if you can look past that this may be for you.",
