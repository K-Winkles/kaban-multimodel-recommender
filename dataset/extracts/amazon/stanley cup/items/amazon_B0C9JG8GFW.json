The 2 issues it has are, 1) The two straw cover caps -cloud and heart- are too loose and don't do anything to prevent spillage, they don't even stay on well. And 2) The heart is a slightly darker pink than all the rest of the accessories. This probably doesn't bother most people the way it bothers me though.",
