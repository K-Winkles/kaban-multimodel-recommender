I put it on the side of the cup while I finished opening my other deliveries, and literally popped off and up! So I went back and put it on thinking I didn\u2019t put it down far enough? But no. The rim is too wide so the smallest amount of touch will flick it off and send it flying. Not the best speaking it\u2019s supposed to hold SAUCE.",
