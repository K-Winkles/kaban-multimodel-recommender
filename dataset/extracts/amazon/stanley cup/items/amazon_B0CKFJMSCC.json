If your straw is slightly larger, these are silicone and will stretch. In fact, it does take some slight stretching to get them to fit a 10mm straw, but that makes them stay in place.

But it\u2019s a cute trendy addition and this set was a fun stocking stuffer for my daughter who had just gotten a Stanley a month earlier for her birthday. I got a Stanley for Christmas and she gave me one of her toppers that matches my cup, I have to admit it\u2019s cheerful and fun and customizes the cup.",
