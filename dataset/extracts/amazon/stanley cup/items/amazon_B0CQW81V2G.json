                "reviewText": "My youngest got a 30oz Stanley for Christmas and I decided to get her some accessories for her Jan. birthday (9 y.o.) This was a hit. She tested it out right away with the snacks I included. The orange looks good with her iris blue cup and it fits well. I like that it's dishwasher safe. Only down side is now her big sister (14 y.o.) wants one.",
