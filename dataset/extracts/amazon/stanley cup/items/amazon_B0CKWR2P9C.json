                "reviewText": "This cup is absolutely beautiful! It\u2019s the perfect shade of baby pink. It doesn\u2019t keep my water cold as long as it claims to, but it stays cold throughout the entire day which is enough for me! I haven\u2019t tried hot yet, so I will edit this review once I do. The silicone at the bottom is a helpful addition. It\u2019s the perfect cushion that allows you to set it down gently without any loud clanks. The straw is normal standard straw width, not as wide as a Stanley straw. The only con I give it is that the top is a little difficult to screw on and off, but it\u2019s definitely not a deal breaker so don\u2019t worry \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd I named her Paisley lol \ud83e\uddc1\ud83e\uddf8\ud83e\udd0d these keychains I added makes her look 10x more precious! Definitely buy this if you what a good quality large tumbler without paying tons for a Stanley! I personally believe this looks daintier than a Stanley so that\u2019s perfect! \ud83c\udff9\ud83e\udd0d",

It\u2019s very much a dupe for that \u201cother one\u201d. This has a top that twists on to secure it. The color is gorgeous (I chose a pale mint green). Note that it is NOT leakproof, but it\u2019s too big to throw in a purse, anyway (40 oz), but fits perfectly into a cup holder- I use it in my car and in the elliptical. I don\u2019t use ice so I haven\u2019t checked to see how long it keeps ice frozen, but for my needs it\u2019s greatIt also came with 2 straws and a cleaning brush! Every other cup I\u2019ve purchaed, I\u2019ve had to buy those separately, so that was a plus!",
