                "reviewText": "This is quite the bundle/assortment of Stanley cup goodies. Let's break it down \u2026The straw toppers: Yes, these are cutesy little straw toppers - but they are also essential accessories, especially if you're using your cup while camping, mowing, or any other activity where bugs or debris might get in there. And you'll lose them from time to time, so you want to have spares. These are nice, and I'm honestly a fan of the little Stanley cup Stanley cup straw topper :DThe cup boots: These are nice, but unlike the straw toppers, not essential. They will help prevent damage to the cup, especially if it's dropped, but they will also make it slightly less stable and more prone to tip over. If you've decided you want one, though, these are quite nice, well-made, very thick, and you get two!The carrying strap: The strap is high quality and well-made. And these are apparently crucial to the Stanley cup trend. While I have no complaint about this one, others I've tried are far more convenient - longer straps, places for your phone, etc. This one is ideal if you're into the minimalist look, though. I suspect this will be repurposed for something else - e.g. a strap for a water bottle, rather than for the Stanley cup.The spill-proof stoppers: little silicone plugs/gaskets that \"fill the gaps\" where the straw is, etc. While I think that these are unnecessary, they could be useful if mowing, etc. to keep debris out. Irrespective of whether they are useful, they are well-made.TL;DR: Everything in this kit fit our 40oz Stanley cups, and everything worked. Some of the items, like the straw stoppers, are essentials. Some, like the boots and spill stoppers, may be needless, or may be handy, depending on your application. All of the components are available elsewhere on Amazon individually - so here is how it shakes out for me: If you want the boots, get this kit. The boots are very nice, thick, and well-made, and worth the cost of the kit - consider the other stuff \"extra\" (every bit of it is handy ot have in a pinch, possibly) and it's still a good deal. If, however, you do NOT want the boots - the remainder of the kit is unlikely to feel like a bargain without them.(only one of the boots and one of the straw toppers are shown in my photo)",

                "reviewText": "If you're like me, you bought the Stanley Cup and then you wanted the accessories to go with it! It keeps getting more and more expensive with all of the \"stuff\"! I found this Siloon 11PCS for Stanley Cup Accessories, and it's a great value for the quality and the # of pieces it comes with. I really like the boots - they fit snuggly and add extra grip, whether you're holding the cup or it's just sitting on a table. It protects the body of the cup, and keeps it from slipping. The straw covers and the carrier is also really convenient when needed. Overall, this is a good quality set and a really good value for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I got this for a 24 oz Owala and it still works great! The bottom piece leaves a lip due to the difference in cups but it holds securely and could easily be cut if I wanted to. In my case the silicone ring for the handle did slide up a bit but I'm not counting this against anything as I'm using it with a different product than intended and it was VERY minor. There didn't feel like there was any risk for me losing the mug aside from not paying attention after a lot of use or swinging. I feel like the lip on a proper Stanley cup mug would stop this.Solid silicone with no strange odors or wrinkles. A great mixed pack of different accessories that could either serve more than one person or just be a great way to sample a few add-ons to your Stanley Cup or other mug all at once.",

It makes it so much more convenient to carry. It stays in place and doesn\u2019t slip out even when exercising. It is easy to put on. My daughter was very excited with the straw caps since it\u2019s required to take her Stanley to school. The silicone boot adds extra personalization too. It is an easy way to set yours apart from a friends. I\u2019m pleased and would recommend this set.",
