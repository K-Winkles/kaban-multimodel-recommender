I was pleased to find the cell phone compartment had an extra pocket I didn't realize it had where I can put money, lip gloss, etc. The cup pocket is adequate to fit my widest and tallest cups. Only thing I wish it had was an extra slip of velcro on the flap to be adjustable for skinnier cups. But I can easily sew one on there myself, which I will do. I also like the soft neoprene material, it feels nice and will make it easy to sew on patches for personalizing it. I bet I'll have friends &family asking me where I got it. Definitely recommend this purchase!",
