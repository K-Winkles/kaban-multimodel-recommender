I knew I didn't want a plain cover, I needed something to match my vibe. These little animals are adorable. Perfect size for a standard Stanley straw and CUTE!",

I'm using the unicorn now and I like that it attaches to the straw so when I remove the topper, it doesn't get lost. So far, no issues and it has helped prevent leaking when I carry it.",

                "reviewText": "Our family owns Stanley cups, specifically the 40oz ones. We were in need of straw covers to avoid an unnecessary spill. We found these Christmas-themed silicone covers and ordered them immediately. They arrived perfectly sealed in a bag inside of a small box. They are sturdy yet soft to the touch. They fit our Stanley straws and give them a cute look. They are the perfect size: not too big/distracting, not too small. I would recommend these silicone covers for anyone looking for a cute way to protect their straws.",
