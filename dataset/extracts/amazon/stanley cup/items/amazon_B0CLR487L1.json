                "reviewText": "Let me say right up front that the carrier is not a bright \"white\" but what I would call a creamy, winter white or an ivory - but that is absolutely clear from the pictures of the item and why I chose it in the first place. Since I've been buying and selling online for years, using a variety of devices to do so, I know that colors do not always appear the same in person as they do on your computer screen but so long as they haven't been edited to look better than they are in person (and this one does not appear to have been edited to look whiter, in my opinion), I accept that as a given. In any event, the creamy white color of this carrier looks great with my sunset colored cup.More important to me than the color is the craftsmanship of the product vis a vis the price and this one gets my highest marks for both. Since I've ordered several carriers from different manufacturers and can compare the features of each, this is the carrier I measure all others against. First of all, it's one of the best priced carriers you can find. Equally important though is its quality and the attention to detail in its construction. I give it a perfect score for the following details:- the color of the strap is a perfect match to the color of the carrier itself- it fits my cup perfectly and the combo fit in the drink holder of my car- it has a double outer pocket so I can keep personal items enclosed in one and my phone in the outer mesh pocket so I can see who is calling without fishing it out- the pocket is wide enough to retrieve my items easily but not so wide that they're in danger of accidentally falling out- the sides of the carrier are reinforced with canvas webbing along the full length of the carrier and not just through the area of the jump rings, which make it less likely to tear along the stress points- the hardware used (the clips that attach the straps) are metal so won't crack or break as easily as plastic- there are two carry straps so it can be hand carried with the short strap or carried cross-body/shoulder with the longer strap- the price is amazingI highly recommend this carrier for anyone looking for a beautiful, well designed bargain!",

                "reviewText": "This is a miss for me because of the color. The ad and the photo say white, but it's actually a beige/lt. yellow color that looks just like the color that medical aids (like braces, wraps, etc.) are made of. When I wear it as a cross body it looks like I have my arm in a sling across my chest. Weird. Other than that, the only other negative I have is that my Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra does not fit in the zipper pocket (it's a little too tall so the zipper doesn't close). I expect a lot of people will fall in this category since phones are big these days. Everything else is good and as expected: the neoprene is well made, light and waterproof. It comes with separate crossbody strap and handle strap as well as a few Stanley-type bottle accessories.",
