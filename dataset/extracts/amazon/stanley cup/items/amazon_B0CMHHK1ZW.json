I grabbed this snack tray for her, because I thought it was funny, and the girl is known for eating tons of grapes and other fruit, so I thought that this made a good grape holder. She found the gift to be hilarious, and acknowledged that it will be a great place to store grapes and Craisins while watching TV. It seems to be made well, and should hold up, but I'll be back to update this if that proves to be untrue.",

                "reviewText": "My friends and I all have these Stanley style 40 ounce tumblers. So, as a joke, I got one of these snack trays for each one of us at Bunco. It was hilarious when I gifted them to each one of the gals. They were mocking them at first, but quickly realized how handy they really are, as there's never a good spot at the bunco table for your drink AND a snack plate. Love it!",

The silicone build is soft yet surprisingly sturdy, clinging to your cup like a koala to a tree. And it's a breeze to clean, which is a win in my book. But, there's a little hiccup - it seems like the cloud straw topper sometimes goes on a little adventure of its own, leaving you wondering where it wandered off to.This snack tray is a nifty little companion for your Stanley cup, perfect for those who like their snacks organized and accessible. It's functional, fun, and a bit of a conversation starter. Just be aware that you might need to play detective with the straw topper. Overall, a solid pick for snack enthusiasts.",
