I did have to let it air out for a while due to the odd smell that came with it. The extra straws, shorter strap, and cleaning brush is an added bonus. There are a slew of these available, so I looked at quite a few before ordering this brand. The cost is all over the board. This cover and extras, when I ordered, was \"reg price\" of about $15 but on sale for about $10. I feel the $10 is about the right price. But I seem similar for as high as almost $25! So look around at the colors, features and price before choosing. White/beige isn't necessarily my favorite color (NOT a fit for my son) but for only $10 - I love it.",

I really like using my tumbler to make sure I get all my water in during the day and it keeps it fresh and cold. What I don\u2019t like is how cumbersome it can be to take it along when on errands, etc. I carry a purse and that takes one hand. So I only have one remaining for keys, bags from the store, etc and sometimes the tumbler gets in the way. This little carry snuggy is perfect. The long strap is my preferred so I can sling it over my shoulder along with my purse to be completely hands free. The tumbler fits perfectly and it adds another layer of insulation to help keep my water ice cold and protects it from dings and scratches. The silicone pieces fit perfectly and work great! A great accessory set!",
