I can\u2019t stand someone hovering or breathing all over my cup/ drink and I unfortunately kept finding myself in those situations at my desk at work. Someone mentioned a straw cover so I looked them up and ordered these for same day. I got them and they are AMAZING. There has NEVER been a time since my straw has not been covered. I know it may seem strange, but it just makes me feel better and that\u2019s what counts. Plus, they are a cute retro vibe. BUY THEM! (They fit amazing!) (They stay on and in place, very stable!) So easy to get on and off and back on, and honestly just plain FUN!",
