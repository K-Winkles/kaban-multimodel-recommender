They are advertised as fitting larger straws, but I can confirm they work fine for the standard size. The extra charms are very cute, but the chains are weak, so be aware. To me, this was just a bonus inclusion, so I was just happy to get any little extra. Fun!",

I work at a school and with a bunch on tiny kiddos always around me sneezing, having my straw covered is kind of (actually really) IMPORTANT. I just got my stanley for Christmas so it hasn't been around too many kids but considering I go back to work on Monday, getting something to prevent the germs from getting to my straw was important. I wanted something that was pink but simple and this checked the box! It fits perfectly!!! It looks great too!!! The only thing is its comes with the gold chain that I don't think I'll be able to use but I'm going to try and figure out a way to use it because its cute too!!! Other than that... I am happy with it !!!! So glad with this!!! I have the stanley that's like hot pink with light pink on the lid. It was a 2 pack from target that came with the white one... so the pink flower straw toppers match perfectly with the light pink!!!",
