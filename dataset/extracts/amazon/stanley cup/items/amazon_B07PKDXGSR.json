                "reviewText": "Got this to help keep my adult beverages colder longer. It does that well. Everything is easy to clean. The lid is easy to remove and has with a wide mouth. The bottle opener on the lid is a nice touch and actually gives the a lid a bit of weight. Can fit 16 oz of cool refreshing adult beverage in there and still put the lid on once the frothy head to go down a bit.I don't really feel any complaints about the lack of a closing lid are justified as buyers know what they are getting when they look at the pictures. If someone wanted a bottle with a lid then get something else. This is like buying an apple and complaining it doesn't taste like an orange.",
