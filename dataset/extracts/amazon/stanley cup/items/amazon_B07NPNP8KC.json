I use double-sided Yeti and Stanley mugs every day of the week at my desk, in the car, etc. and can't imagine going back to an old school plastic water bottle.An open cup with no lid? Eh. Why? I put it to the test of how cool it would keep water, and it actually kept a glass of icewater relatively cool in a room where the temp was consistently between 75 and 85 degrees for almost a full day. The ice did melt, yes, but the water stayed cool. No sweating or condensation on the outside. And then my stupid cat came to play in it (open water is a temptation he cannot avoid) and knocked it down off the counter. No issues, did not break or crack or show any damage.So these really are nice for outdoor or warm-weather dining, and in cooler temps, for hot drinks.... you know, for those times when a giant mug with a straw in it isn't quite the thing to have at the table.",
