                "reviewText": "Very cute. I love the grayish blue of the enamel. It's very shiny and has those smooth textured bumps like an orange peel. I hope they make a replacement lid that has a closure because I spill a lot. Easy to hold onto, and it carries just the right amount of coffee for me. Not too much or too little. The stainless steel cleans easily and the mug itself is super heavy duty feeling quality. I'm not throwing it around to test it, but it feels like it could take a drop or2. Quite thick Insulated walls, but with the hole in the lid, it's not gonna keep your drink warm forever like some other mugs. Again, a replacement lid with a closure would be awesome. updateI was pleasantly surprised when this mug kept my coffee warm for about 6 hours despite the open lid situation. I still am not favoring the lid, however. Because there is no vent hole to allow the liquid to flow out smoothly, it just kind of dribbles out. And because the drinking joke is so wide, I feel like I'm going to spill down my cheeks.",

                "reviewText": "Update, mug is good, but lid design is extremely bad, buy mugs with screw on lids!!!I got the white color and when the silicone seal was clear, after coffee got around the seal by drinking out of it, sealed stained , just looked dirty, I called STANLEY, the lady told me it was tricky getting seal on and off, and she wouldn\u2019t recommend me doing it. I wanted the lid to be replaced, she informed me, if I didn\u2019t want a dirty seal, I should have ordered two mugs that have dark lids. I had to get brave enough to remove the seal. Unreal, it wasn\u2019t just stained silicone, it looked like brown sludge. It didn\u2019t loose the stain, but they were clean. My husband and I both worked on them and finally put down until this morning. The seals WILL NOT GO BACK ON. After calling Stanley and waiting for call back, what a joke, I found ANOTHER phone number and they are sending new lids, BUT same problem down the road. Do yourself a favor and get a screw on lid.Absolutely perfect, great and it\u2019s so nice to be able to seat my cup down and when I take a drink, it\u2019s actually hot. First thing I do is fill it with hot water, tap hot water, while coffee is brewing and by the time the coffee is brewed, dump water out and add coffee &creamer and enjoy entire cup. I have had people tell me they don\u2019t put the hot water first, but we keep our home rather cool and why not take any chances?Enjoy!",

Also the opening is shaped so as to not really fit lips. Hot beverages do not stay warm. Would love to see an alternative lid become available for this cup. I ordered this mug because I have the Stanley 40oz cold beverage cup and it\u2019s amazing. The tall camp mug has a great design which allows it to be placed in a car cupholder even though the cup has a handle. However having a cup lid that doesn\u2019t seal the liquid in will not be going in my car.",
