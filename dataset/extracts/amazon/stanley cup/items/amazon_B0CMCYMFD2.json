                "reviewText": "I have always wanted one of these tumbler holders. Some of them have a holder for your phone. When I saw that this one has a see through phone holder, I had to get it. I tried one of my smaller tumblers and it worked, but I had to tighten up the flap. This works great with my larger tumbler. I put my phone in the pocket, and tried to use it, and I couldn\u2019t get the phone to turn on. Well, I had the phone upside down. Oops. Once I got the phone in correctly, I just had to press around and found the on button to the phone. When it was actually on, I started to slide the screen around and it was very responsive. I\u2019m loving it. This comes with all sorts of accessories. It has a key clip so you don\u2019t need to carry them separately while using this. There is a little cap for the straw that is so cute. It looks like a mini tumbler. And also a brush for cleaning your straw and a straw that is good sized and works well. Plus, a shoulder strap. So many things. What a great value. The holder itself is made very well and it should last for a very long time. I highly recommend this tumbler holder. I\u2019m going to get more for myself and also to give as gifts. With everyone carrying their own water nowadays, this is a must have.",

                "reviewText": "I don't own a Stanley mug but for years I've been looking for a solution for when I go on easy hikes that don't need a backpack. Normally I'm juggling way too many things in my hands, a delicate balancing act of keys, water bottle, phone, wallet, cash... usually without pockets. It's maybe a little overpriced for what it is, but this is a nicely made neoprene-like material and the phone zipper window is huge - bigger than my iPhone 12. I plan to attach my keys to the carabiner and put at the bottom of the bag, then put my water bottle on top. Only downside to this is that the velcro isn't very wide - it ONLY fits a 40oz bottle snugly, any smaller water bottle will be more loose. But considering this is specifically advertised this way this is more of my own problem than the result of the product itself.",
