                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A classic, for good reason.",
                "reviewText": "I use a Keurig coffee maker for the brew quality, but I don't always like having to go across the house to make a cup every time I want one, so I've used all kinds of big travel containers and thermoses over the years. Eventually I decided to ditch the mediocre travel containers and get an actual time-tested Stanley vacuum container. In retrospect, it was a good call.Anyone who's walked through the camping section of a Walmart will doubtlessly recognize this vacuum flask. It's been around seemingly forever (apparently since 1913.) It's a classic, and for good reason. It gets the job done, it does it very well, and it even looks good, bringing to mind the nostalgia of childhood camping trips.This container says it can keep hot drinks hot for 24 hours, and iced drinks cold for 120 hours. I haven't tested this only because I haven't felt the need to. It works better than any of the other travel containers or vacuum flasks I've owned over the past ten years. Your mileage will vary if you use it like I do and are constantly taking the top off throughout the day because opening the container does allow some heat to escape, but that's an inescapable reality of any drink container.The upper-most metal cap is actually a cup, and the containers actual top\u2014or seal\u2014is beneath that cup. The seal itself is a big, thick plug that screws into the mouth of the container. It's made from a hard, quality plastic with a flexible gasket to retain heat and prevent leaks, and it does both very well. I can't imagine this container leaking unless that plug piece actually broke somehow. The container is just barely too big for my car's cup holder so I lay it on my passenger seat on its side, and I've never seen so much as a single drip.The handle feels sturdy and I trust it. I like the way the it folds in and sort of snaps in place against the container to take up less room and prevent jangling around when you don't need to use the handle.I rated this container 5/5 stars for every section, even the \"easy to clean\" section. Cleaning does require a long \"bottle brush\" of some sort to clean thoroughly, but that should come as no surprise and these bottle brushes are cheap and easy to find, and they make cleaning exactly as easy as you'd imagine because there are no weird angles or edges inside the container, just a smooth taper that's very easy to scrub.All in all, this Stanley container was a great purchase. It does exactly what you expect it to do without any letdowns. It's built very well and to high quality standards, and is very affordable. You really can't go wrong with this one.",
