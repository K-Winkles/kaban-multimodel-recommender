                "reviewText": "The straw caps in my order all appear to be made of silicone or similiar rubbery material, and generally fit straws that are wider than average. They will not fit the jumbo size, however, and trying to force a fit won't work without manual alterations, which I do not recommend. If you try to use them on straws that are only a bit smaller, they will simply fit loosely, perhaps even droop a little, but should typically still remain loosely in place. If you use them on straws that are a lot smaller, they typically won't stay in place. The cap becomes top heavy, unbalanced, and unstable, and will not stay in place well at all. So do use these caps with straws that provide a snug but not forced fit, or maybe a slightly loose fit.Each straw cap here is uniquely designed to resemble an animal character. I find this design style to be quite cute, as well as useful. So far from my own experience using straw caps, there are actually several ways that well made straw caps can be useful. First way is to help identify and keep track of your own beverages when in social gathering settings. A lot of times, such gatherings use sets of beverage glasses that look identical to the others. The second way is to help keep the straw drinking end clean of potential debris that inevitably gets inadvertently pushed and scattered around social events and onto surfaces. And the third way is to help keep certain kinds of beverages colder, or carbonated, for longer. The last 2 ways mentioned only really works if the beverage glass is also fitted with a straw compatable lid. There are likely even more ways, but those are the ones that come to mind.I really enjoy the cute animal characters design. They help make their use a bit fun, in my opinion. I am also happy with their performance so far, when used with properly fitted straws. They generally seem fairly durable as well, for something that small sized. Just be mindful of how thin that strap is that connects the straw anchor point to the straw cap. I cannot yet be certain of exactly how strong that silicone strap is, and do not want to break it just to find out. But with it being so thin, it does seem a bit vulnerable. This appears to be a standard feature of straw caps, though, so Im not going to minus stars for it.5 out of 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "My wife and I are huge cat lovers, and jumped at these because they actually look like our cats. These straw covers are absolutely adorable and exceptionally well made.Even zooming into the nitty gritty details while taking photos of the cover, it's hard not to be impressed with how awesome and clear these covers are. There aren't any minute imperfections on them, and they all look great. While they didn't fit none of our straws in the photos, the friction from the silicon made working with them great. We will be picking up some 10mm straws in the future to use these. So just be sure these covers will fit your straws.I can't say enough about the quality of this product. It even comes with a plastic case with a thank you anti-tamper sticker. The color and clarity of each of the toppers is vibrant and sharp. There wasn't any funky misshapen parts on the straw cover and and extension either.My only critique is the Cat mom one was replaced with another cat. It's great and all, but another cat such as a Scottish Fold, or a grey tabby would be wonderful. Maybe for a version II of this set in the future. For cat lovers who want straw covers I got to give this a high recommendation.Sometimes it's just those small things in life that you look at, smile, and it just makes your day feel better. These covers are exactly those small things.",
