Our silicone boot is indeed specifically designed for the Stanley Tumbler 40oz. Unfortunately, it won't fit the Stanley Tumbler 30oz. How safe is the material? I'm considering one for my wife. We completely understand your concerns. Our boot is made from food-grade, BPA-free silicone. Newly produced boots might have a slight odor, but it can be easily eliminated with some airing or a gentle wash with warm water. I own a cream Stanley Tumbler 40oz. Can the color of your silicone boot match it perfectly? We place great emphasis on color matching for our products. While we strive to imitate the color of the Stanley Tumbler, there might be slight variations due to differences in material. We always aim to get as close as possible. There are many similar silicone boots on Amazon. What makes your product stand out? Great question! Our boot is a newly upgraded design, characterized by its thicker and taller build, offering better protection, especially for the base. Additionally, our product is made from premium materials and undergoes strict quality checks.",

I'm considering ordering more colors both for my other Stanleys and just as options for changing it out. For the price point it seems very likely. :)",

My goal is to be able to change out the colors based on the uniform colors of the day (I'm a huge Ravens fan).This boot is smooth and attractive. It goes onto the tumbler easily and in my opinion, it adds an extra layer of insulation as well. Win-win if you ask me.Overall, I would highly recommend this boot!",
