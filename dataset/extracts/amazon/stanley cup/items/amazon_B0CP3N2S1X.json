These straw covers are great for putting a little extra color to your cup, as well as helping keep track of which one is yours really easily! Super easy to clean, just threw them in the dishwasher on the third rack (could also put them in the silverware caddy I'm sure) and they were ready to go. They have not disappointed yet!",
