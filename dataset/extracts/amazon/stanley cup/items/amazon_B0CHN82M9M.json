This cup has a tight secure grip and keeps my drinks cold, I love to chew ice, so it\u2019s perfect to soak my ice in all day and crunch on like a snack lol Also it\u2019s easy to clean and the color meshes well with all of my rose gold and pink accessories. Thank you Stanley",

The ergonomic handle design is great for carrying, with no stress on hand or wrist. Leakproof cap, which you can purchased replacement gaskets when it wears out.For myself personally I wish this came in the traditional hammered green. A bit on the fence if the coating used will be as durable as the traditional hammered style.Good thing there is a lifetime warranty with Stanley.I would recommend.",

It's a smoother surface than the lavender color which I think makes it more susceptible to marks. Otherwise, the cup is as described and keeps drinks cold, no condensation, no metallic taste. I prefer this over products with straws because they're hard to clean. I'd recommend in colors other than the glimmers.",
