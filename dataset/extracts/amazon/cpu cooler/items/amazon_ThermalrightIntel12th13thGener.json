The process of installing was extremely simple and cheap. After installing the new mount, I have noticed a temperature decrease of around 3-5 degrees, which while may not seem significant, I found to be reassuring for the overall long term health of my CPU.",

                "reviewText": "Rather easy to install, I removed the motherboard from the case, and removed all my RAM. It might be doable without taking the motherboard out of the case but I didn't want to try it.I run a 12900KS with a less than optimal cooling setup (360mm non-push/pull with Lian Li Uni Fans), while not terrible it gave the CPU less breathing room than a more traditional push/pull config most people have for their i9 CPUs.I did limited testing using Cinebench R23 multi-core for 10 minutes which as far as I know will induce thermal throttling quite easily for 12th and 13th gen i9 CPUs. With the stock ILM and ambient around 22-23C my CPU would immediately thermal throttle and drop to around 4.73 GHz; I have tried this on and off with similar results using the stock ILM.After installing the contact frame and repasting I did see a noticeable improvement. CPU idle temps dropped 3-4C, it would also take time for thermal throttling to occur. The first few Cinebench R23 runs wouldn't even thermal throttle while it would thermal throttle for a few seconds half way through before heat saturation in my AIO had it stay thermal throttling for the duration of the 10 minute run. But across the entire 10 minute run the CPU held an average of 4.9 GHz with it dropping down to around 4.85 GHz near the end and the CPU drawing as high as around 30 more watts with the contact frame installed.I am quite impressed with the contact frame especially given my less than optimal cooling setup for my build and would easily recommend this to anyone running an i7 CPU and strongly recommend this to anyone running an i9 CPU provided they are comfortable with replacing the stock Intel ILM.",

Gamers Nexus had excellent info on how much of an improvement in contact it creates, and how to install (even with my big block cooler).Extremely easy install, just use the basics of even screw tightening. They're very polished & pretty, but under a cooler you literally cannot see at all.",

If you are going to install this make sure you are extra careful when removing the factory retention bracket. Don't be like me. It was a costly mistake to drop a screw on to the CPU Pins. Think it is ridiculous that this exists though as intel should not have an issue with the socket.",

                "reviewText": "decided to rebuild my computer using a i7-12700k and from what i read and what all my builder friends told me, having this retainer is a must for the long term, as it helps mitigate temperature spikes and evens out the CPU to Cooler contact, allowing for an even heat distribution. Now, I\u2019m not super computer savvy and I\u2019ve only built 3 computers in my lifetime, but if I can install this easily, than anyone can.I placed my CPU on the board first before removing the old retainer, just to insure I wouldn\u2019t damage the board/ pins. I placed the new retainer over the CPU and tightened the screws in a \u201cX\u201d pattern to make sure it seated properly. All screws should only be a little more than finger tight, no need to really torque down on it. The screws do bottom out, so you'll know when you've tightened them enoughI\u2019m running a noctua NH-U12S redux and at idle, it stays around 38c -45c, at load, it hovers around 56c to 65c. This is at stock, no overclocks done. I don\u2019t know what the temps would have been before this retainer but i want to believe that it did make a big difference as I\u2019ve seen others with this same CPU say their temps have been higher. Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s well worth picking this up, especially if you are concerned with temps or want to overclock.",
