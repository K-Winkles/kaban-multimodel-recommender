The AK400 stands at 155mm tall, which suits most ATX/ M-ATX cases, though it is strongly recommended to check the CPU cooler height limits of your PC case before purchasing. Which motherboards support the AK400? The AK400 supports the latest sockets on Intel LGA 1700/1200/1151/1150/1155 and AMD AM5/AM4 What do I do if there are any issues with the product?

                "reviewText": "I'm upgrading my desktop from the AM4 to the AM5 platform. I decided to take my AM4 hardware and drop it into another build. That being the case I decided to give the AK620 a shot. I've heard great things about it. Reviews I've seen had equal or better than more expensive and larger Noctua NH-D15. I have the Chromax Black version on old 5800X that I'm replacing.It's only been a few days but the AK620 has been great thus far. My 7800X3D idles at 38-39\u00b0. It's whisper quiet. I had my side panel open to look for any status lights on the motherboard and I couldn't hear it running. The smaller physical size made much less of a pain in a butt to install than the D15 was. I already have magnetic tools but if you don't, Deep Cool includes a solid magnetic Phillips head tool for installation. Installation is standard fare but the included instructions are great if you are inexperienced. They have pictures and individual sections dedicated to Intel and AMD installations. It also includes a handle cable to that you plug both of the CPU fans into and then into the board. I wish I had one for my last build. It would have made things easier.TLDR; I'll update this if things change, but as of now I'm thoroughly impressed. It's keeping my 7800X3D cooler than my D15 kept my 5800X. It was easier to install. $40 Cheaper. It's quiet. Includes an installation tool and clear instructions. The only real negative I can come up with is that it doesn't include brackets for a 3rd fan, but honestly I can't see needing a third fan. Just mentioning that in case that maybe important to others.Update: So good I bought a second one. I'm earlier review I mentioned upgrading my system. Well I decided to take my old parts put them in a new case and build another system with them. Long story short, the Noctua was too big. It always prevented me from using one of the PCIE slots but in my full tower, I had enough space to mount my video card in second slot. In the mid tower case I picked up, the video card had virtually no clearance in the second slot. So bought another AK620 and it resolved the issue.I could mount it in the first slot. I can't say enough how impressed I am with the AK620. More compact, cheaper, and better than my NH-D15. Deep Cool has outdone themselves.",

                "reviewText": "I have been an avid water cooler pipe head for many years. As I have gotten older, it has been more and more difficult to 'burp' and lift my pc. Recently I had a Ryzen CPU start going belly up on me and figured I would make the move to air while replacing it with a new one. So far, this CPU cooler works GREAT. It is quiet, EASY TO MOUNT and just works. I don't know what people are saying that is bad about the mounting on the kit, it was easy for me and seems to work well. This thing cools great and has yet to get noisy or loud. Then again, I haven't started overclocking yet either. Do I recommend it? Yes, I paid $50, and I feel that was a fair price.",

                "reviewText": "I use this with a Ryzen 7 5700X cpu. Before getting this I was using a stock amd wraith cooler that came with an older amd cpu I had. I realized that I needed to upgrade since my cpu would get to 90C when running games like R6 and Valorant. I've had this cooler installed for about 4 months now and my cpu stays in the 70s for the most part when playing games.I have this installed in a Corsair Carbide Series 275R ATX Mid Tower Case. It is kind of a tight fit. Installing it was fine but when I put the glass panel back on it is pretty close to the glass but not touching.I originally wanted to get an aio cooler because I like the look of them better but I decided to get an air cooler instead since I wasn't ready to spend 200$ on a nice aio. I got this for under 70$ and I've been happy with it.I watched a lot of videos reviewing, testing, and comparing different air coolers and ended up choosing this one because of its price and performance. It keeps my cpu at good operating temps and I think it even improved airflow in my pc.Something to keep in mind is that it is not the quietest cooler. When its at idle the fans are fairly quiet but when running a game the fans speed up and the noise is noticably louder. Its not obnoxious or anything but noticeable for sure. If you have noise canceling headphones then you'll probably be fine.",
