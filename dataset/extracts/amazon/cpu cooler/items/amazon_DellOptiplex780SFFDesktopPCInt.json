I just need something to run a few business applications and general simple household software. I especially appreciate the fact that it comes simply with Windows 7 Pro and Explorer - no junk added on. I was easily able to load all of my software that I need for daily use, and set it up just like my old one. I am planning on updating with Windows 10, but haven't done so,as of this review. Hopefully that will run just as smoothly. I will be purchasing another from this seller for my son, who is a student.",

If you put it in the system specs as windows 7 then make sure it is windows 7. A complete waste of time. probably just get a refund and go else where to buy the pc i want.",

What I received is a Dell Optiplex XE. Similar but not the same. Also, the product page confusingly indicates in one place that it would come with Windows 7 and in another place that the computer would come with Windows 10 installed. This is the kind of missleading and confusing information I expect from sellers on ebay, not on Amazon. I didn't attempt to return the PC, because it was needed as a replacement for an actual Dell Optiplex 780 that recently died and it is just good enough, but I'm not pleased about it. Having Windows 7 instead of 10 has lead to multiple issues with the computers user.",

The one I received has some weird metal covering right on top of the memory, so I can't add memory for now. Reason I bought it: I have tons of code going back to 1990. So this 4GB memory 160GB HD bruiser allowed me to install my paid version of VB6 onto the $109 Windows 7 machine with a legitimate license. I find that funny: Windows was expensive for some of us hackers back then, but now you can get Windows 7 for basically nothing.",

                "reviewText": "Next time I go for a PC I will select JSM as the vendor!!!!! I have purchased from them before directly via my Company.Previous to this I ordered a PC from Amazon, didn't work, returned it. A replacement came. It was scratched but I was going to keep it, after going thru initial setup it worked , but the DVD tray would not open. The cover was bent in at that point thus binding the DVD tray. Returned it for credit. Thankfully it was credited.",
