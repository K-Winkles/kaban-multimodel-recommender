                "reviewText": "I decided to give NZXT Kraken a try after i had bad experiences with Corsair Hi Capellix AIOs (their pumps are unbearably loud). According to many reviews Kraken and Corsair Hi series go head to head for the top spot in AIO business. I've tried both, and i like Kraken a lot more than Corsair.Noise: In my build i strive for ultra silent build with maximum performance. As i mentioned before Corsair pumps are really loud, they sounded like a dental office practice right next to my ear; after a while the sound started to drive me crazy. I've read reviews that NZXT fans are not great and are very loud, so as i bought my x73 Kraken i also ordered (x3) Noctua NF-A12 120mm fans. Let me tell you guys, this set up is dead silent. The pump is barely audible even at 100% load mode and Noctua fans are well know for their performance and silence. I don't know how loud Kraken is with original NZXT fans, but Kraken AIO with Noctua fans is silence enthusiast's dream.Perfomance: Performance is great, Kraken is actually fares a bit better than Corsair. I get 35C idle on boosted CPU speeds @ 4350MHz and i get 70C on 100% multi-threading test in Cinebench. Corsair was 40C idle and 69C is Cinebench.Aesthetics & RGB: This one is very subjective, because different people like different things. Personally i prefer Corsair pump design plus their RGB quality & brightness is twice that of Kraken, but constantly buzzing pump was a deal breaker for me.Installation: Corsair AIO was harder to install. Each fan comes with 2 wires one for RBG one for fan control, it also comes with a command module with more wires. Kraken has a lot of wires too, but it's set up was more straightforward and easy. The length of wires was just enough for my needs but barely. One thing i didn't like about Kraken set up is that i could not install pump-head traditionally at 90 degree angle to the right because it's water houses extend too far into RAM housing territory, thankfully the pump head is easily rotatable & adjustable, so i settled for a 45 degree angle set up.Conclusion: If i could i would take off half a star for subpar RBG brightness, inability to mount pump-head at 90 degree angle and wires that should be a bit longer, but all that is not enough to take down a full star in my opinion. All things considered NZXT Kraken X73 is great AIO, it cools wonderfully, it's dead silent and it's pretty good looking. Worth the premium price, and it lives up to multitude of positive reviews online.My Build:CPU: Ryzen 7 2700XMOBO: ASUS ROG Strix X470-F GamingGPU: EVGA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER SCRAM: G.SKILL Trident Z RGB 32GB (4 x 8GB) DDR4 2400Mhz, CAS 15-15-15-35NVME: Samsung 970 PROPSU: Corsair AX Series AX760PC Case: Be quiet!

                "reviewText": "The NZXT Kraken 360 is a liquid CPU cooler designed for high-performance cooling in desktop systems. In this unbiased review, we'll evaluate its various aspects to provide you with a comprehensive overview.**Cooling Performance (4.5/5):** The NZXT Kraken 360 offers excellent cooling performance, thanks to its 360mm radiator and powerful fans. With a larger surface area and efficient liquid cooling, it's capable of keeping your CPU temperatures in check even under heavy workloads or during overclocking. It's a great choice for users who demand top-tier cooling capabilities.**Noise Levels (4/5):** While the Kraken 360 provides impressive cooling, the noise levels can be a bit of a concern. The included fans can get a bit loud when running at full speed. However, this can be mitigated by adjusting fan profiles through the software. At lower speeds, the noise levels are more acceptable, but if you're looking for a whisper-quiet system, you may need to make custom fan curve adjustments.**Build Quality (4.5/5):** NZXT is known for its quality build, and the Kraken 360 is no exception. The cooler features a solid construction with a durable pump and radiator. The tubes are flexible yet sturdy, and the overall build instills confidence in its long-term reliability.**Installation (4/5):** Installing the Kraken 360 can be a bit more involved than air coolers, especially due to the radiator and fan setup. However, NZXT provides clear and detailed instructions, and most users with a basic understanding of PC components should be able to handle the installation. The mounting system is secure, ensuring proper contact with the CPU.**Software (4/5):** The NZXT CAM software is a crucial part of the Kraken 360 experience. It provides comprehensive control over the cooler, allowing you to fine-tune fan speeds and monitor temperatures. The software is user-friendly, but some users may find it resource-intensive. It's worth noting that you'll need to install the software to unlock the cooler's full potential.**Aesthetics (5/5):** The Kraken 360 is known for its aesthetics. It features customizable RGB lighting on the pump head, allowing users to match it with their system's color scheme. The RGB effects are vibrant, and the pump head design is sleek, making it a visually appealing addition to any build.**Value (4/5):** The NZXT Kraken 360 is positioned in the premium cooler category, and while it offers excellent cooling performance, build quality, and aesthetics, it might not be the best value for users on a tight budget. If you're willing to invest in a high-end liquid cooler with top-notch features, this is an excellent choice.**Conclusion:**The NZXT Kraken 360 is a high-performance liquid CPU cooler that excels in cooling capabilities, build quality, and aesthetics. It's an ideal choice for enthusiasts and gamers who prioritize efficient cooling and want a cooler that looks as good as it performs. While the noise levels at high fan speeds could be a drawback for some, the overall experience and customizability provided by the NZXT CAM software make it a premium cooling solution for those willing to invest in their PC setup.",

                "reviewText": "Installed on i9 14900K. Keeps it cool, looks cool, and you can customize the LCD to display different.things, even animated gifs! Rgb software works hand in hand with the RGB fans on the unit as well as additional nzxt fans I installed on the front portion of the case. This is my first liquid cooler, and it's much quieter that my old giant heat sink and fan setup. Nice to have a visual of the temp looking inside as well. I currently have it setup to have the led lights white, and they gradually change color as temp goes up. It never goes red because the CPU stays very cool. There are a bunch of options for the leds. The sync with music/sound is pretty neat. My kids for a kick out of that.It does the job with some eye candy. Ver happy with the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Pros : game changing cooling, was normally running around 70\u2070C when playing and dual streaming. After install rarely gets above 55\u2070C. The software is easy to navigate and gives options as to how aggressive the pump and fans will cool. Easy installation, straight forward step by step guide and tons of videos on YT if you want a visual guide. When PC is just playing games routine temps are in the 40's. LCD display is clear and pretty decent resolution with customizable options to font color and background.Cons: cable and power management is tricky. Pump and fan controller both require power from your supply. I have a 1000W installed so not a huge deal, but had to be managed. I kept 3 case fans installed and added the 3 fans on the coils, adds another USB controller and each fan has 2 cables. It requires a thought out cable routing plan, or it will be a birds nest stuffed in spaces around stuff.Overall a good price point for an exceptional water cooling pump and fans.",
