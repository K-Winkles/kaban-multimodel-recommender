Far better than I was expecting at this price point.If you wanted to make it even better you could give it a polish finish with a fine grit sand paper and polish wheel, but it looks good enough to slap on out of the box if you just need basic cooling and aren't looking to optimize every factor.The fit and finish on the metal components is extraordinarily impressive at this price point. I have Noctua, coolermaster, Intel, AMD, dell, HP 2u server and all sorts of Chinesium CPU coolers and it really is hard to believe they're able to produce this item at its cost, that or we've all been seriously overpaying for CPU coolers.The fan looks good and has a high quality feel to the plastic, it's dense and similar in material to other much more expensive PC fans that I own. The mounting components seem pretty average generic tower cooler stuff done in style of a Noctua mount with one screw per side in the middle of the cooler that screw into metal plates that screw into the backing.Will update post install/testing.",

CHEAP QUIET AND WORTH ITS MONEY IN GOLD.I like to add anything negative I can (this is the best I got)The fan cable was about 1/2 inch shorter then I would have liked. But I just had to turn the housing brackets, this put the power cord in a place I didn't like.And the copper tubing where meets the cpu could be flatter you can tell there's very slight voids. I just added a smidgen more paste then usual. (judging by my temps the uneven has very little to no issue)That's all I got.I ordered a fan to pull off of this cooler because I didn't expect it to be this good of a set up (2nd fan), it hasn't arrived and it isint needed. (for the customer thinking they need a little extra you likely don't.Ps the English version of the instructions are even perfect no guesswork!",
