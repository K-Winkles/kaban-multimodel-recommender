With added fans dropped to an insane 28-30c while on stress test! And for being quite a big fan is stays very quiet even at high throttle.",

This is the best cooler that I have ever bought at its price point. I highly recommend this cooler to anyone, and I will happily recommend it to anyone of my customers. If you are looking for a cooler and you are on a budget, there is no need to look any further because this cooler is for you. Its performance is just as amazing as its price. It has a solid mounting hardware that is way better than any other cooler at this price point and it includes everything you need. Solid affordable cooler without having to lose performance. I really hope that someone reads this review and decides to go with this cooler because I can promise you that you will not regret it in any way. I do not have one thing that I can complain about with this cooler.",
