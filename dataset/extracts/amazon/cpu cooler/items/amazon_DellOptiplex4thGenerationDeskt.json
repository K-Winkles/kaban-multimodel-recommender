Cosmetically it was like new except one very minor blemish on the case. The model number Dell which I received was a 9020 rather than the 7020 as the picture suggests. The 9020 model has only 1 open slot, since one slot is used for the WIFI board. That limitation did not matter to me, but might matter to anyone needing more open slots. Overall setup was very easy. When I ran into a minor problem. Steven at tech support was very helpful. After Steven's help, I was able to have the computer up and running in less than 10 minutes.",

Will NEVER buy from them again. This is ridiculous. Slap a bunch of crap parts together and sell em! Now I have 3x as much work to do to get these PCs ready. I have no words for how upset I am right now.Update: 2 of 3 were like this, one had a wifi card installed, one an ethernet card to replace the dead one on the motherboard. Also missing the hardware jumper so gave an error on boot that it was completely missing. Good thing I have some spare parts laying around and managed to find one. Maybe I should start cobbling these parts together into \"complete\" working machines instead of trying to buy them. Wow is all I can say.",
