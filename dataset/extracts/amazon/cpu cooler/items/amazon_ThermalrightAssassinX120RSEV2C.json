Other than that it performs really well. Keeps an AMD 5700x around 35c idle, 60c during gaming. It was very simple to install.",

It only came with the 4 pin fan header. It\u2019s a solid color the fan although you can put another fan and probably daisy chain it. the installation is good, so is the quality just wished it was actually ARGB",

The only drawback was that my DIMMs prevented me from mounting the cooler horizontally. If the cooler were a bit taller, or my DIMMs a little shorter...but I just had to have those damned RGB DIMMs.",
