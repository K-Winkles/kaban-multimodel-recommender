                "reviewText": "This review is for the Floe Triple Riing RGB 360.I have this cooler for a year now and it works flawlessly, just bought another one for my wife's new build. (Update 2021: Both coolers work without issues for 2 and 3 years respectively.)I wanted a really quiet/silent build, so here's my review from that angle. (For context, this AIO system is the only mechanical moving part in my PC, the power supply and graphics card all stop their fans at low-medium loads + I have an open Thermaltake P3 case, so I'm really nit picky when it comes to noise)Fans: Using their software, you can reduce the fans RPM to the 500 range, at which point they are virtually silent, even with your ear right next to the fans.Pump: The pump is another story. I was pretty disappointed as it made an audible buzzing noise that could be heard from several feet (I have an open Thermaltake house). I eventually found a solution: In BIOS, change the CPU fan mode from PWM to DC, and decrease the voltage all the way to 40% (5 Volts). This will slow pump RPM to the 1100 range. This significantly cuts back on pump noise so it's really only with the ears close up.The cooling is really efficient even at these reduced RPMs, never had any issues with my Intel 8700K (not overclocked).The RGB lightning looks awesome, the software is not great, but works.Overall, really satisfied with my purchase.",

Since adding this i did take out my 980TI/SC SLI setup and put an MSI1080-TI TRIO in it,man do the RGBs match up perfectly,looks stunning together,I just wanted to let you know so far the longevity of this AIO is top notchthis is taken from a comment i made on a 1 star post-but it works for a main review as welli dont have the instructions handy,but if you have a clue they are not hard to follow,it clearly states how long the hoss are-if you didnt check for your application that is your own fault,the water block felt fine and installation was simple,yes you lose a usb 2.0 header but no big deal if you have a decent MOBO that has more than 1,it worked flawlessly on a fresh install,then once i downloaded the drivers for it it is absolutely beautiful,on top of all that it keeps my 4790K at mid 20s C at idle and not above 70 while benchmarking-no it isnt cheap but well worth the money.I have used this in the Thermaltake x-31 and x-71 mid and full size cases-perfect fit and looks awesome,and as i mentioned its cooling properties are awesome.",

                "reviewText": "My 7 year old Corsair H115i aio water cooler had degraded to the point where it would not keep my old AMD 8350 cool so I was looking for a replacement 280 mm aio water cooler and came across this new ThermalTake 280 mm cpu cooler for $69.99. Not sure why it was so cheap but I snapped it up and was not disappointed. Instead of 65+ C (and climbing) CPU temperatures it is maintaining the cpu temperature in the 30-35 C range during normal load. So no more high temperature shutdowns. It is a high quality cooler with all the LED bells and whistles (not that I need them but it keeps my case exciting).Apparently aio water coolers lose coolant via permeation through the rubber tube walls over time and as a result have reduced cooling capacity. My old cooler lasted 7 years so I am happy with it. I suppose I could have attempted to take the pump apart and refill it but at $70 for the TT cooler I opted for it instead.As far as the low low price, the only thing I can figure is Amazon must have excess stock and was trying to manage it. I have seen this pricing strategy before at Amazon and have taken advantage of it when I can.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, the cooler works really well (I have the 280 mm version) and looks super sweet. My Ryzen 7 2700x hasn't broken 55 C under gaming load, and that's with the radiator fans only at about 60% speed. It idles around 34 C. I only have a few small issues with it.First up, the instructions that are included are pretty bad. They help with setting up the pump bracket, but that's about it. If you are new to PC parts like I am, then you will have to look up the rest on YouTube.Second, I really wish the tubing was just an inch or so longer. The pump head barely reached from the radiator at the front of my case to the cpu itself (Thermaltake Core G21). It reached, but just barely. The tubing is stiff, which makes it very tough to rotate like I had to do to make the logo be upright.Third, the Thermaltake software is not the best. Yes, it works and yes, it covers all the basic needs, but it is far from being perfect. You can control each fan's lighting and speed independently, but you have no control over the pump speed. Also, I really wish there was a way to link the fans together, so I could adjust both radiator fans simultaneously. Not a huge deal, but annoying. If you are ocd and need the lighting to perfectly match up on the fans, look elsewhere. I have yet to find a way to make the lighting effects sync up together perfectly.Overall, it is a fantastic little cooler. Works very well and runs pretty quietly. Not silent, but massively quieter than my previous air cooler. Those 3 issues were enough that I had to remove a star. I still think its a solid value and a great performer",

                "reviewText": "I've been running this for a couple of weeks now and overall I'm happy with performance and I'm seeing the improvements that I had hoped for. India is a hot country and I noticed that my CPU / GPU temperatures were growing alarmingly hot on the more demanding games and FS2020 in particular. This unit will only cover the CPU obviously but I've found that it's brought the overall temperature of the system down as the CPU must have been radiating quite a lot of heat into the case. The temperature of the CPU and GPU generally stays below 60-65C now, which I'm happy with.The only complaint I'd have is that the instructions are absolutely useless. I strongly recommend visiting YouTube for some better guides. Choose the professional guides since some of the amateur guides are simply wrong (one guy put the radiator and fan on back to front as well as the wrong way around so was blowing hot air back into his case!). Overall installation wasn't particularly difficult. As with everything, if this is your first time doing it then expect to take 90 minutes or so but now that I've done it once I reckon I could do the whole thing again in 15-30 minutes and I'm not particularly dexterous. Also, make sure that you have the full AM4 CPU heatsink bracket. I'd thrown mine out because it wasn't required for the stock Wraith cooler that comes with the Ryzen chips and replacing it was a lot more expensive than I would have liked.Delivery was on time and everything was in good condition upon opening the package.(System: Ryzen 2600X, AMD 5700XT)",
