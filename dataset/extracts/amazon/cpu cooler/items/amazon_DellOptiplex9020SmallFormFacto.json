                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a used, reconditioned Dell Optiplex 9020 Small Form Factor Desktop with Intel Core i7-4770 from Amazon. The reconditioning took place in a plant in Canada. I am very pleased with the performance of this computer and the ease of setup. I chose this system from Amazon after comparing it with other refurbishers because of Prime shipping.I had been running Zoneminder on a Raspberry Pi 4 to process the video from 4 cameras and store the footage on a 6 TB external Hard drive. That system struggled and I finally decided to upgrade. The newest Raspberry Pi seemed expensive, so I decided to look at used Intel boxes. I found this system on Amazon for less than the cost of a Pi and with a free keyboard and mouse. Seemed a great bargain.When the system arrived, it had Windows 10 Pro installed. I did not want to destroy that. I was able to shrink the partition on the 1 TB hard drive and install Debian as a dual boot operating system. The process was made easier by the fact that the drive came formatted using the GUID partition table (GPT). I installed Grub to manage the boot process, which was a breeze after I figured out that I needed to change the BIOS boot process from Legacy mode. I was able to connect the same external hard drive that I had used with the Pi to one of the USB 3 ports and it mounted without fuss under Debian.The system comes with both HDMI and Display Port video but sans cables. I had a spare Display Port on my monitor, so I bought a cable (one-day delivery) from Amazon, and I was up and running. After initial configuration I mostly log into the system with Putty, so I hardly use the monitor. But I did want sound capability. I purchased a cheap USB speaker, and it works great. My total investment was still less than the Pi and it runs circles around it.Rather than use the USB mouse that came with my purchase, I used the built-in Bluetooth to connect my Logitech MX master. Once again, no problems whatsoever, one less cable to mess with. I am using both the WiFi card, built-in and the 1GB ethernet port. The drivers for Debian installed by default for both. I didn\u2019t have to hunt for anything, plug-and-play!I love the size of this thing. You can see it in my picture beside my full-size desktop system. The external Hard Drive (purchased separately) is sitting on top of it.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this product to anyone looking for a reliable and affordable computer that is easy to install Debian Unix on.",

I was even surprised when I opened the box and there was a keyboard and mouse with the computer. I had not realized those were included. Again, the computer works great, is fast and great value. I would purchase again.",

                "reviewText": "From opening the box and seeing this older case computer, but what the heck, it was refurbished and felt I should try it, it probably has all newer parts inside it, updated as described on Amazon. and Amazon approveAAter. I tried another power cord, nothing, and I tried another one of my computers using that same power cord and yes, my other computer powered up, then plugged this same cord into this older crippled computer I just bought and this older computer had no power. Then I figured the power supply in this older computer was dead. A horrible experience with this computer from the start. I would not recommend this company to anyone, even my worst enemies. I tried to contact the seller and was not able to, so I contacted Amazon customer service to help me. they were not able to contact the seller, or the company who refurbished this computer. The company did approve the return of the computer and sent a mailing label to return it back to them an they would refund my purchase price. I went to UPS Drop-off location and they took it from their location. I told them that computer was already broken and that's why I was returning it. Now, I still didn't get a notification that they receive it, so no refund yet... I might add that after I had this problem and couldn't discuss this with the sales agent and amazon was unable to get in contact then too, I looked at the reviews of this computer, and so many of those reviews were far worse than my terrible.",

I set it up anyway, thinking it might be better or equal to the one I wanted. It did not boot up. The memory was damaged or installed incorrectly. I was very hesitant to buy another refurb computer, but I had a budget and did not want to spend over that. I went ahead an purchased from this company. I got a Dell Optiplex 9020. It was packaged very well. Had a keyboard and mouse very well packaged to assure a safe trip. Put it up within 20 minutes. It was perfect. There were some very slight scratches on the CPU, but nothing I couldn\u2019t live with. It booted up and installed updates. Everything worked perfectly. I am so happy. It is very fast. I highly recommend this seller. You will not be disappointed.",
