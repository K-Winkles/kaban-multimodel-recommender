The material is also different, the original one has more weight to it.I didn't want to bother returning since I needed them in a rush (which is why I ordered from Amazon in the first place because of next day shipping), but I didn't want to risk damaging anything because this set clearly will put more pressure on the mounting plate and the CPU itself. In the end I added a washer on top of the stand to make it about the same length as the original one and it worked, but it's clearly not worth the hassle not to mention it's more expensive than the original Corsair ones.",
