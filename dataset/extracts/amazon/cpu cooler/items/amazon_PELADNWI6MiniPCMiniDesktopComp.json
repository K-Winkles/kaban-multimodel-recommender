We are an older couple, so surf the web, shopping, check email, balance checkbook, zoom the grand-kids, etc... is what we use it for. We don't do any gaming, so light duty. For the price, this item has worked just fine. I would like the fan to be less noisy (4 stars instead of 5 for fan). The fan comes on immediately and stays on and is audible at all times.Bought a monitor, web camera and speakers to go with it and we have a fully functional replacement for our old desktop at a considerable savings over buying a new desktop.Time will be the ultimate judge, if it lasts long enough to become obsolete also........",

                "reviewText": "Bought mostly to upgrade from my pi server and to have something new to play with. Still setting it up, but it's been solid so far.First things I did were replace the Peladn-branded SSD with one I had laying around because I just don't trust it and to repaste the CPU cooler with high quality paste. Runs extremely cool and while the fan is on more often than not, it's not loud, and there are fan options in the (expansive) bios that you can play with.The wifi is pretty OK. Decent signal strength and speed through three walls. I am using the ethernet instead which gets my full 550mbit/s connection speed and has not dropped or had any other issues.A side note - if you're taking this thing completely apart just be aware that the wifi antennas are glued to the underside of the top of the case and if you're not careful while taking the board out I can definitely see snapping the wires.All the USB ports work and the USB3 ports are 10gbit. Connectors are neither too tight or loose. Everything inside seems pretty solid.Can't vouch for it's performance in Windows but running a Plasma-based Linux desktop it's super snappy, and if you're just running a headless server there will be plenty of resources free to do whatever you want.",

Full function USB C will operate and power a USB C touch screen monitor. As mentioned several times - not a 3D gaming machine.The Bad: Wireless was not the best (~8Mb/s to 20MB/s max and unstable - not really useful for YouTube). Not sure if I got a bad chip or what. After trying everything in the book to fix I gave up and bought a TP-LINK Archer T3U USB Wi-Fi Adapter and got the Wi-Fi up to 80Mb/s. Now it's fully useful for what I need.",

                "reviewText": "For 172 bucks this is a steal. Now it won't do gaming like I wanted it to, but for the price you get a great machine that is small and inexpensive as compared to full blown computers. I have several Mac's and wanted a Windows based computer to do some work and some gaming with MWIII, and some Office products. I have at home a new setup with dual 4K monitors and a hub/switch that I connected with 8K HDMI cables to this computer. It operated great with normal computing things like email, powerpoint, excel etc. It bogged down a couple of times when I had multiple windows open and started to play with some photos and videos. After that I tried downloading and playing some games and this thing did ok in the beginning but then really started lagging about 20 minutes into my games. If your looking for a gaming console or computer this one will not be able to handle it. But for a little less than 200 bucks you get a great little computer and just have to add some new monitors and maybe a hub for dual capability.",
