                "reviewText": "The Thermalright Assassin X120 R SE is so good. It's inexpensive, isn't the most difficult to mount on an AM4 system, is quiet, and keeps temperatures super low while the CPU is under load. I installed mine onto a B450 board with a 5600G. Compared to the Wraith Stealth during a Cinebench R23 benchmark, 10-minute run, temperatures on average were 19+ degrees C cooler with the Thermalright Assassin X. The ARGB fan is nice and sturdy and while only 8-leds, it's plenty bright and very quiet at idle speeds.For the cost, the performance is out of this world. I'm unsure how well this cooler will perform on higher TDP CPUs (5600G is only 65W), but I definitely recommend it.I took a couple of stars off for the mounting system/ease of install as the brackets are a tad fiddley. I highly recommend installing the cooler before you put the motherboard into your PC Case. As I was replacing my cooler, my mobo was already installed, so it was a bit more difficult than I liked.Other than that, this is a great product for those looking to get better temperatures for not a lot of money! A+++",

                "reviewText": "I started hearing about Thermalright coolers on YouTube a few months ago. I wanted to replace a Wraith Prism cooler in an older computer I have so I decided to try one. Since it's not my primary computer I didn't want to spend very much. I shopped around and found the Assassin X120 Refined SE ARGB for less than $20!First of all, I don't know how they can sell these so cheap. Everything oozes quality, from the packaging, to the fan and heatsink itself. For $20 I expected it would just be thrown into a box with no padding. Wrong. It's packed very securely with lots of padding. Included are instructions and everything you need to install it, they even included the thermal paste! The instructions were very clear, making it one of the easiest CPU cooler installations I've ever done.The Assassin not only looks like it should be more than $20, it performs like it too. My idle temps (Ryzen 3700X) went from the 50ish degree range all the way down to 26-29 at 30% fan speed. Incredible performance for the money! The fan is also very nice with bright LEDs and isn't too loud.I'm blown away by this cooler. Thermalright has definitely won me over.",

                "reviewText": "Replaced my AMD stock Wraith cooler with this for better fluid logistics in my case. Got a 3 pack of 120mm fans from the same company.The installation process takes a lot of close attention to exactly what's shown, since there's no words pointing out fine details like which way is up for the brackets, spacers, and fan clips. Still only took like 10 minutes but kinda annoying.The fan clips are nice and simplistic. Exactly enough to hold a fan firmly in place in either direction with no excessive screwing or manhandling your delicate computer's parts. Intel could learn from this.Heat pipes are quality, the fin stack is gorgeous and very effective. Got an extra .2ghz out of my overclock and my Temps still dropped by 15\u00b0C at max usage. (This was with all the fans I added, not just the cooler)For a $20 hunk of special metals, it's pretty outstanding the cooling you can get out of it. These horizontal fin stacks are something specialOnly complaint is that the pressure across the CPU from screwing it down is uneven, and you have to eyeball it pretty hard to get it even, maybe a level would help too. I wouldn't use it with a chip using the high side of its cooling capacity.A having 4 screws and a set height that the cooler sits that matches the socket would fix this with not much change to the design, and pressure distribution would be way better.",

                "reviewText": "After going back and forth on a few coolers, I decided to go with this one for my new Intel i5 LGA 1700. The price was very good, well designed, ARGB, sturdy, quiet and fits inside my case. I liked how thermalright states the deminsion of the air cooler.I watched a few videos on the installation so when it came to it. It was relatively easy. I used a pea sized thermal paste which seem to work really well. The fins on the heatsink seem sturdy which I liked. After installation, my i5 CPU idles around 23 degrees which is really awesome since I've always used stock intel cooler. The fan is also very quiet and now with the ARGB inside my case lights up. Very cool!I'm very happy and can definitely recommend getting this cooler!",
