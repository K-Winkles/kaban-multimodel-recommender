                "reviewText": "I needed something small and this has more power than I thought it would have. Sure, it's using one of the \"H\" cpus and has integrated graphics, but this particular combination is as capable as my 7th gen i7 Desktop with discrete graphics - and is more powerful in some aspects.The fan does run when under a load, but that's understandable for the footprint this thing is trying to occupy - and the fan is a lot quieter at full speed than most of the other computer fans I've been around. They must have invested in quality fans that produce sound at a frequency that is not nearly as \"noisy\" as others.I'm running it at 4k and it will tackle a browser-based game just fine. It starts up nice and snappy, and handles all the office work I can throw at it. That, and I can hide it behind the monitor or stick it in my pocket. The bluetooth works great with my Logitech KB/Mouse so I don't have to have an extra dongle, but there are tons of outputs if I needed to. Having DisplayPort as well as HDMI was a plus for me since my monitors cover the spectrum of inputs due to their widely varying age. For a simple office setup, the HDMI cable delivers sound through the monitor speakers and bluetooth connects KB/Mouse, so I've only got 2 wires out the back and no dongles. It's clean - and effective.",

                "reviewText": "Are you going to be able to run games like Valorant, Warcraft, Diablo on it?No. Absolutely not. But that's okay.I specifically got this little mini pc to be able to replace my bigger normal size desktop tower for work and it has been amazing!I run a lot of large Excel files that contain everything from graphs and pivot tables to macros and large formulas.At any given time I usually have 3-6 chrome tabs, outlook, teams, 2-6 excel files, and multiple other small internal company programs open and this thing has been able to handle all of them beautifully!If I do have all that open when I try to run an Excel macro I do notice the fans kick on.They're not super loud but you do notice it.However, after my macro has completed its task everything quiets back down.The only thing this does not have is speakers but I'm wearing a headset a majority of the time so I don't really miss that or even notice it.Taking into account the CPU power, a 500gb SSD, & 16gb of RAM among other things, this thing can pack a powerful punch and is well worth the price!After being able to demonstrate the differences between my old tower and this I've actually got work to start buying a couple more for others in the department that needed upgraded as well.10/10 would buy again.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Very capable mini PC with a serious flaw (update regarding replacement)",
                "reviewText": "Update April 10, 23: Note that my review is for the SER 5560 which is not currently sold on Amazon. Beelink replaced my SER 5560 under warranty with an SER 5800. This unit is, so far, totally satisfactory without the restart issues of the 5560. It does not have Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6) but otherwise is a more capable until. While I'm not happy about having to return the unit, in the end I am satisfied with the SER 5800 that I now have. Updated stars to fouf. Update March 23: Unfortunately, I've had to update my review. Dropping the rating from five stars to two stars. The reason for that drop is that my Beelink SER5 is generally not capable of restarting unless totally disconnected from its power supply. That means that Windows Updates or driver updates that require a restart/reboot are quite problematic. Beelink acknowledges the issue in its support forum and suggests returning the PC but I'm past the 30 day window and Amazon support seems to be no help. The symptom seems to be limited to units with an AZW V1.0 motherboard which Beelink says is defective. I have reached out to Beelink support directly but haven't received any reply. I suggest perspective customers for this unit avoid it and look elsewhere either for a different model or different manufacturer.Prior review before I discovered the restart issue:The Beelink SER5 (Ryzen 5 5560U) more than meets my expectations. It is quite powerful, appears well constructed and conformed to the description on Amazon. Shipping was quick and the product arrived in pristine condition. I'm not a gamer, so I can't speak to how well it would perform as a gaming machine but it does not have a separate GPU, so I'd say gaming isn't really the intended purpose of the unit.I did some benchmarks for those interested: Cinebench 23: 7877 multicore, 1288 single core. Geekbench 5: CPU--1333 single core, 6029 multicore. Compute 11775. Crystal Disk Mark 5 showed a read data rate of 3,044 and a write data rate of 1645 MB/s for the NVME drive.Pros: 1) Quiet, generally inaudible even under load. I hear the fan briefly at start-up and then all is pretty silent. 2) Bios is unlocked and there are lots of options (and a front panel reset). 3) Two 4K HDMI ports 4) Wifi 6E. 5) Windows 11 Pro has no bloatware. 6) Internal temperatures stay well under thermal throttling limits even with Windows 11 Pro optioned to the performance profile (25 watts). The case is well ventilated. 6) Memory and the internal NVME drive can be upgraded easily above the 16 gigs and 500 gigs provided.Minor Cons: 1) AMD Master software (for overclocking) won't run since these is really a laptop processor where heat under limited ventilation is critical. 2) The provided method for attaching the Beelink to a VESA mount is just a bracket with screw holes, so once the Beelink is attached to a monitor, it will take a bit of effort to dismount it to, for example, add a hard drive. 3) The method of adding an internal SSD or 2.5 inch drive requires removing screws, prying open the case, and carefully avoiding damaging the internal drive cable. 4) The wi-fi range isn't excellent. My Beelink, while able to transfer data at full speed when close to my router, had speeds fall off more than other devices (Apple and Android) at the same ~20 foot distance from my router. I think an external antenna might help. I can't test the units 6E capabilities since it is the only such device I have. 5) By its nature (size), there are limited upgrade opportunities beyond memory and NVME/SSD disks. 6) Being picky I wish for the 2 USB ports on the back of the machine to be 3.0 rather then 2.0 and for the audio port to be on the rear rather than front of the computer.To conclude (edited): I think the restart issue is a \"show stopper\". While the capabilities of the Beelink are awesome, the failure of the restart sequence is serious and MIGHT mean other serious issues will surface.",

It isn't a workstation, but I already have one of those and I wanted a little backup pc. I have another Beelink Mini pc and it works well as a backup pc, too. I want to expand the RAM on both pcs, but they both work well for what I am using them for. I like Beelink and I like the small footprint the pc provides. It is solidly built and performs well. I am not a gamer, so I cannot provide feedback about that. But, as a multimedia developer, I think it handles resource intensive programs just fine. I am very happy with my purchase.",
