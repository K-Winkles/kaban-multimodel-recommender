Thanks to the same proven heatsink design and NF-A9x14 PWM fan, it stays true to the NH-L9a-AM4\u2019s successful formula of fusing a height of only 37mm with strong performance and excellent quietness of operation, as well as 100% RAM and PCIe compatibility. At the same time, the chromax.black version with its black fan and black coated heatsink combines these assets with a sleek stealth look. Topped off with the renowned SecuFirm2 low-profile mounting system for AMD AM4 and Noctua\u2019s enthusiast-grade NT-H1 thermal compound, the NH-L9a-AM4 chromax.black is a premium choice for customers who seek an ultra-compact heatsink that looks just as great as it cools.",

This means that neither the heatsink nor the fan overhang the RAM, so the cooler provides easy access to the slots and is fully compatible with tall memory modules. 100% compatibility with PCIe cards on mini-ITX Some AMD-based mini-ITX motherboards have the PCIe slot located close to the CPU socket zone. While larger coolers that exceed this zone may block the PCIe slot, the compact-sized NH-L9a-AM4 provides full compatibility with PCIe cards. Custom-designed SecuFirm2 mounting for AM4 The NH-L9a-AM4 comes with a custom-designed SecuFirm2 mounting system for the AM4 socket of AMD\u2019s Ryzen platform. Allowing the heatsink to be fixed from the back of the motherboard, it makes installation easier than ever, all while maintaining the trusted SecuFirm2 quality.",

It does not interfere with full height RAM, is very compact while being very quiet and provides good cooling. It is a down draft cooler that directs air towards the motherboard, which in my circumstance, is an extra benefit because there is no other fan in the case. The CPU is a Ryzen 3 3200G processor with 4 cores. It is not being maxed out at all. The online reviews suggest that it can handle a much higher thermal load than what I\u2019m subjecting it to.",

Install was very easy and didn't interfere with the ram sticks at all.I received a 5600x3d for Christmas and challenged this cooler on keeping it cool. I seen it go to 90 degrees c pretty quickly but I did expect the cooler to struggle with this cpu. I installed another noctua cooler that was compatible with the fractual terra and seen Temps that were more acceptable. I'm gonna keep this cooler as I will build another computer in another fractual terra for my wife.",

Low noise level, quality heat sink, and modular fan if you want to swap fans. The only issue that I find with this cooler, like many others, is the mounting hardware. Not the hardest one I've had to deal with, but it could be a easier, especially if you have to reseat the cooler or swap the cpu. I took several YouTubers advice and installed it upside down. While a minor inconvenience, it still didn't deter me from giving this product 5 stars. What went above and beyond for me was the absolutely excellent presentation and packaging of the product. It shows what a quality company Noctua is and you know what you are getting is premium grade.",

Most 120mm AIOs didn't have the tube length I needed, tower coolers were too tall, and a lot of 'low profile' coolers conflicted with the RAM slots.This ended up being the best option for my secondary system, and does an excellent job keeping it cool. Mounting is kind of tricky since you have to flip the motherboard upside down and install it that way, but it wasn't too difficult. And what I liked most was being able to swap out the fan for something with a little bit of color as they included screws for both low-profile fans like the one included, as well as screws for thicker fans such as a Scythe RGB fan I had purchased to go along with the cooler.",

Case is a itx cooler master nr200 16gb ram 3600mhz, 650 watt power supply. Only problem I\u2019m having is the Cooler can\u2019t keep the CPU under 70c at Home Screen. Under load running ready or not at load screen it got as high as 90c. Also did a test with left for dead 2 and got similar results. So if you are planning on using a 5800x with this cooler. I would not recommend using this one. I\u2019m probably going to look for a beefy water cooler.",
