Hitting 90c under full load 260watts. I added this cooler and I instantly like the quality of the radiator. The paint looks and feels good. The sleeves on the water tubes are nice and the USB connection for the power is sleek looking and not an eyesore. I like the fans they run well but are not annoying loud. They do get loud but it\u2019s only at 300watts full load. Now my CPU is at 5.6ghz all core 4.5ghz e core and it runs great. While gaming this has dropped my gaming temps by 10-20c depending on the load and the water pump is not loud. I\u2019ve had about 4 AIO and this is the best quality ones I have seen. Also to note the pump seems to run cooler then my older AIO\u2019s",

I am using the factory applied paste so I could probably get better temps with some tubes I have but haven't bothered.

                "reviewText": "My last water cooler was a corsair h105 from about 2013 and lasted me al the way to 2023 but I changed my motherboard and cpu and I could no longer carry over the h105 so I bought this one instead I'm very impressed by the build quality on this cooler, everything was perfectly packaged, no bent fins, was surprised on how many cables it has, my old one just had a power connector and the fan pins. Also appreciate the fillport on the side, my old one didn't have this fill port, the only way to fill it up was to remove the copper plate and carefully add water, then close it back up.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Love the way this AIO looks and preforms pretty good. Easy to install for AMD CPUs and keeps my 7800x3D cool when gaming. My CPU sits at around 45c when idle and when playing starfield getting around 33 to 59% cpu usage it sits around 58c with it going up to 65c when loading new areas or systems. I also only had one issue while using this AIO and it was when it stopped detecting it in iCUE when I installed a lian li strimer plus v2 24 pin cable. A simple uninstall and reinstall of iCUE fixed my detection errors tho. Do recommend if you are doing a mild RGB build like me and dont want every single part in your PC to have RGB or over the top RGB",
