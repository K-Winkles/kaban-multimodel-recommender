                "reviewText": "So, for those who have trouble keeping the temps down on the 13700k intel CPU, this has done wonders for me. The install was pretty straightforward and they also have a video on YT if you get confused. I did top mount mine just to ensure longevity of the AIO. Originally, I tried to cool the 13700k with the Peerless Assassin SE 120 air cooler. While it did an OK job, it just wasn\u2019t able to keep the CPU from thermal throttling. Since I have installed this AIO I have been able to bring my average gaming temps down over 10\u00b0C and never once hit a thermal throttle. I also did a Cinebench 24 test, never once thermal throttled. This AIO is fantastic. The quality is on par with the expensive ones, just without the fancy LED pump face. It looks fantastic and is quiet as can be. It\u2019s so much quieter than the air color I had, almost silent. My current idle temps are 25-26\u00b0C. This thing does the job for the 13700 CPU. I\u2019m very happy with the purchase!",

                "reviewText": "Thermalright has consistently demonstrated one of two things: Either they have such a competitive advantage that they can produce outstanding products at half the price of their competition, OR their competition has been gouging their customers for years now. Thermalright air coolers already have a great reputation as a good \"bang for the buck\" option. Now their liquid coolers will too.This Frozen Notte (Italian maybe? It's a stupid name) is priced at about half, or maybe less, of its nearest competitor as far as I can tell. Cosmetically, it looks fantastic. The infinity mirror works great, and makes an amazing visual for your PC. The fans are decent looking, and the RGB lighting is nice, if perhaps a bit bright at times.Maybe you don't care about visuals and just want performance? I think it delivers here too. I'm running mine as an exhaust fan, so the radiator is already getting all the case heat along with CPU heat. With my 7900x processor, the max I run is about 80degrees C while on Flight simulator, which is perfectly acceptable to me. I wish it was a bit better, but then I feel the heat coming out of the case and wow, it puts off a lot. The radiator is obviously working to dump so much heat out the top of the case.Noise is a bit high at times, although I don't have much to compare it to. Other high-end air cooled PCs I use (typically with a HUGE Noctura air cooler) get louder when under load. I don't know how this compares to other water coolers, but it's never intrusive. The pump on this is silent, I can't even tell it's running over the other case fans in the system. Oh, and the pump is inline with the water tubes, which means you really can't mount this wrong. The pump will NEVER be the high point of they system they way they designed it. You just can't do it wrong.This thing is a real bargain. There are probably better coolers out there that will drop CPU temps by a couple of degrees. And they cost 2x or 3x what this one costs. They certainly don't look any better visually (although an LCD screen on the water block would be cool). At this price, getting anything else is just throwing money away. Buy it now, before they figure out they could charge more for it.",

                "reviewText": "Recently upgraded my system (Ryzen 7 5800x w/ 64gb of RAM) to a 3090 TI, and noticed my CPU temps were hitting 80c+ suddenly. I replaced the stock Wraith Prism cooler with this, and my temps haven't gone above 70c even during hours-long 4k/120hz gaming.I've used a Corsair 360mm AIO in the past, and didn't have anywhere near this kind of impression. This thing is quiet, extremely simple to hook up, and there's no third-party software to download that interferes with everything else like iCue does. It includes a daisy-chain connector for the 3 included fans for both true PWM (which you can adjust) as well as another daisy-chain connector for ARGB setup.Only \"complaint\" is that mine came with the fans pre-installed in the \"opposite\" direction of what I needed (fan cords exposed with radiator installed). Considering that's a personal preference, I'd say that's a win for being the only complaint!",

                "reviewText": "This cooler is great for the price! I'm using this on an i7-13700K with a hefty overclock, 5.8ghz for light loads and 5.6 ghz for heavy loads. In guardians of the Galaxy, the processor was pulling around 80 watts and was around 50-55C. In heavy all-core loads such as shader compilation in Hogwarts legacy or Modern Warfare, the processor was pulling around 250-280 watts and this cooler was keeping it from hitting thermal limits, staying around 88-95C.(100C is the safety limit). Without the overclock things would have been even cooler. For $70 I'd definitely recommend this for cooling an i7 or a Ryzen 9 without spending too much. The fans do get loud at full speed but they're pretty quiet in games. You could definitely adjust the fan curve to keep them at a reasonable volume.",
