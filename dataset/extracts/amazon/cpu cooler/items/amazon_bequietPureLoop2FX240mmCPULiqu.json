This is the key to provide the well-known silent be quiet! operation. One Hub, many Possibilities The ARGB-PWM-Hub enables synchronization of up to 6 PWM fans and 6 ARGB components. This allows the user to run all your cooling and lighting gear with just one PWM and one ARGB header on your motherboard. It can be positioned everywhere inside the case and by that supports a neat interior and cable management. Easy to refill The refill port is easy to access which makes refilling safe and comfortable. The coolant bottle included in scope of delivery makes it easy to achieve a long lifespan.",

Assuming you set the curves right. I'm using it with 7950x3d. No complaints so far. I absolutely love Be Quiet for their engineering and how quiet their devices areBe aware of the complex cable management. There are A LOT of cables: one for each motor and one for each LED. If you don't wanna deal with it, get something simpler! Also you have to squeeze the hub somewhere. Make sure your case was made with cable management in mind! Otherwise you'll have bad time. I have Lancool III and it works great, tho I still had to be creative. But it took us a while to get it all beat.",

Pure Loop 2 FX 360mm: Powerful Cooling, Quiet Confidence (with a Few Quirks)Overall Rating: 4.5 out of 5 starsFor: Gamers, overclockers, noise-conscious users, high-performance PCsAgainst: Pricey, bulky for some cases, lack of RGB (if you're into that)Cooling Performance: 5 out of 5 starsThe Pure Loop 2 FX 360mm lives up to its name, keeping my overclocked Intel i9-12900K cool and calm even under heavy workloads. The large 360mm radiator and powerful Silent Wings 3 fans efficiently dissipate heat, resulting in impressive temperature drops compared to air coolers. I saw temperatures stay well below thermal throttling even during intense gaming sessions and benchmarks.Noise Level: 5 out of 5 starsThis is where the \"be quiet!\" part truly shines. The Pure Loop 2 FX runs incredibly quiet, even at full speed. The Silent Wings 3 fans generate minimal noise, making it virtually inaudible during everyday tasks and surprisingly quiet even during gaming. This is a huge plus for noise-sensitive users and those looking for a peaceful computing experience.Build Quality and Design: 4.5 out of 5 starsThe Pure Loop 2 FX feels premium throughout. The aluminum radiator is solid and well-built, and the hoses are flexible yet durable. The pump also features a sleek LED ring that offers a subtle glow (though no full RGB if you're into that). Installation was straightforward thanks to the included pre-applied thermal paste and clear instructions. The only minor gripe is the size \u2013 the 360mm radiator might not fit all cases, so be sure to check compatibility before purchase.Value: 4 out of 5 starsThe Pure Loop 2 FX comes at a premium price, which might be a sticking point for budget-conscious builders. However, its exceptional cooling performance, quiet operation, and premium build quality justify the cost for users who prioritize top-notch thermal management and a tranquil computing environment.Things to Consider:Size: As mentioned, the 360mm radiator might not fit all cases. Check compatibility before buying.Price: This is a high-end cooler with a high-end price tag. Consider your budget carefully.No RGB: If you're into flashy builds with lots of RGB lighting, this cooler might not be for you.Final Verdict:The be quiet! Pure Loop 2 FX 360mm is a top-tier CPU liquid cooler that delivers unbeatable cooling performance with incredibly low noise levels. Its premium build quality and ease of installation make it a compelling choice for gamers, overclockers, and anyone who demands the best for their high-performance PC. While the price and size might be dealbreakers for some, the unparalleled cooling and quiet operation make it a worthy investment for those who prioritize thermal excellence and a serene computing experience.Note:This review is based on my own experience using the be quiet! Pure Loop 2 FX 360mm for several weeks. Your results may vary.Feel free to adapt and personalize this review to your own experience and preferences. You can add specific details about your build, temperature benchmarks, or personal pros and cons.",

Installed easily, the quality feels great, plus I really like the design of the Be Quite! Lightwings, and like the name, it's quiet so far. CPU idles in the low 30s, under load rarely breaks over 55, on a 11900k, temps could certainly be a bit higher on new CPUs however.One Caveat for people who use a Y60. The fill port screw on the radiator will press against the radiator bracket on the Hyte, not allowing you to fully screw down the fan situated on that side. I ended up using a pair of tin snips I had to cut out a small square indent to allow the screw to fit, so everything was flush. While an easy fix, still a bit of an annoyance.Overall, great product by a great brand.",
