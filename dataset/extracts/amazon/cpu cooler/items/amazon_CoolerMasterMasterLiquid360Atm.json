                "reviewText": "This cooler works great. I'm coming from TWO EK CR240 coolers that developed grinding pumps within a month. Installing this, the pump is dead quiet, and using the same fans (Phanteks T30) and same thermal paste across all of them, this runs about 5c cooler than the EK coolers. It could be the large difference is due to the pumps, which seem to have been defective. Either way, this cooler is dead silent and cools well. You don't have to use all of the RGB nonsense it comes with and deal with a big nest of cables, either. If you just want to install the cooler without fan RGB it's just the PWM pump header and the fan header on the mobo. You can plug the pump head in to any 2nd gen RGB plug on the motherboard, too. It's a very clean install overall.",

I see a few other reviews have cited missing parts as well. The parts missing are the wiring harnesses. I've tried to use their customer support site but it has not been helpful (very glitzy, but forms don't work). If you look at my purchase history, I have a long history of buying Cooler Master products, but this experience will turn me off from future purchases.",

                "reviewText": "This 240L water cooler from Cooler Master is replacing and Enermax made 120L RGB water cooler than served me well for approx. 2 years, but the pump developed a rattling noise that was very disturbing, and CPU temps were reaching 100C. I realized that the water pump was going to leave me.This was for an Intel 8 core I7 9700 CPU. I removed the Enermax and replaced with the Intel air cooler that came with the CPU. The system became quiet and temps stabilized around 50C which are normal.I ordered ths Cooler master that had excellent reviews. Very nice and quality built. Instl instructions were very easy to follow. CAme with the Creo fuse thermal paste that was fairly easy to apply, without any applicator. Straight from the tube. Installed everything and presto. System works very quietly and the temp stabilized around 32 C. the 2 fans are actually very quiet. Very happy with this new water cooler.The only con is the RGB. It's suited for 3 pin RGB headers while my motherboard, an Asus Z390-P model, comes with a 4 pin RGB header that is unusable. But this is a minor con. I will look for a 4 pin to 3 pin adapter cable, then this will work with RGB lights. Not an issue.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Huge difference from previous cooler, but packaging leaves a lot to be desired",
                "reviewText": "I was torn on buying either this model or the arctic liquid freezer ii. In all honesty, I chose this model because it would arrive much quicker, and I regret my decision. I don't really care for RGB in my pc so I would have been much happier paying a little less to lose the flashy display. This was my first AIO and to be honest, the packaging and instructions are just flat out, lacking. The instructions are crudely printed with white images on the back of the black boxes for each compartment with little to no text directing you. The images are small and not very detailed with no clear guidance and their website is even less helpful. It took me a few youtube searches to finally get the process down enough to start the install.One thing that is beyond annoying is the amount of wires. The fact that the three fans aren't daisy chained together makes no sense in this day and age. The 3 to 1 wire they include is stiff and difficult to work with. The CPU plug on my motherboard is at the very top so trying to get it connected but also angled so it went behind the radiator left plenty of scratches on my fingers. For the pictures on the box for the RGB connections, you are to assume you have to either connect all of them using the 5 to 1 cable they include or the control box. If you work with RGB on a regular basis then you would know you could just connect each of the plugs together using the male and female plugs, but since this is my first time working with RGB I had no idea. After plugging everything in and connecting the pump to my cpu I turned on my PC to test everything out and at first it looked like everything was running perfectly. My temp was down, the lights were on and the fans were spinning, at 100%. I knew these were PWM fans so I tried to adjust the speed with the bios, but nothing would change the speed. Finally I decided to remove the included 3 to 1 plug and use one of my own and that, for some reason, solved the fan spinning problem.Next problem, my temps started spiking. I am running an AM5 7800X3D and my cpu usage was at 0-1% so there shouldn't have been any of the spikes I was seeing. I assumed it was the paste application since that's usually the easiest fix so I took off the pump and cleaned the paste only to notice an imperfection on the copper. There was a small black spot that wasn't a scratch and didn't feel like a groove. I tried cleaning it with isopropyl alcohol but it was not coming off so it was either from the factory or something happened during shipping. There was no protective film over the copper, just the paste applicator pattern, so I don't know for sure what it was, the only thing I knew was I didn't drop, slam or scratch it. I requested a replacement and after inspecting it for any imperfections, reinstalled it and so far it's running like a champ. Temps are steady and much better compared to my previous air cooler.I'm sorry for the long winded review but I wanted to share from the perspective of a new AIO owner and how painful the whole process was. If I had to do it all again, I would have just purchased the Arctic, but since I've already done an exchange and installed another model, I'll just keep it so I don't cost Amazon any more money.",
