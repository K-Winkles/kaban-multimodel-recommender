                "reviewText": "---- Updated Nov. 16 2020 ----I am dropping my rating down to 1 star as this PC is performing even worse than I expected. This PC is unable to handle streaming (720p 30fps, 6Mbps) without having the audio drop-out every 15 seconds or so. Occasionally it's not just the audio, but the video as well. I'm not sure if I got a bad unit since other reviewers had good luck, but my experience with this PC has been awful. I do not recommend it to anyone!---- Original Review ----At-a-glance (full review below):PROS:- Compact size- Good number of connectivity options- 2.5G Ethernet port- Easy to open for upgrades, repairs, etc.CONS:- Quite slow, severely limits potential applications- Old WiFi card- Power settings not very clear- Fan is underpowered, causes thermal throttling\u2014\u2014 Full Review \u2014\u2014I was looking to add a small form factor PC to my home theatre set-up to use for applications that won\u2019t run on an Apple TV, and for Steam in-home streaming. This mini PC looked to be a decent choice, so I gave it a try.Out of the box, I was very happy with the size of the PC and how easy it was to open the case to access the internals. I am pleased that the PC is quite upgradable, even given its small size: you can add an 2.5\u201d drive, replace the M.2 SSD, swap the WiFi card (though the antennae are glued-in, so this may prove to be difficult), and more. On the outside, there are is a wide array of connectivity options (multiple USB ports, HDMI, etc.) which is useful as it opens up more options for how you can use the PC.The included instructions are quite minimal, but do call-out a few useful settings in the BIOS. There\u2019s a lot more in there though, so a more comprehensive manual would have been nice to see. Additionally, the included mounting bracket only uses one screw, so I\u2019m not sure how much I would trust it (to be fair the PC, is quite light, but still).Unfortunately, my experience setting-up the PC wasn\u2019t as positive as I was hoping. The initial Windows 11 set-up took quite a long time to complete, and after it completed I immediately ran into problems. My HDMI output was no longer working, and without it I wasn\u2019t able to find the shutdown menu (I\u2019m used to Windows 10, not 11). Holding down the power button didn\u2019t seem to do anything, so I ended up needing to unplug the PC to get it to shut down (more on this later). After restarting the PC, I was able to get my display back and perform the (length) Windows 11 updates required.At this point, I took a look at how the hardware appears in the Windows 11 settings. To my surprise, the ethernet port looks to support 2.5G (I was expecting 1G) but I am unable to test this. Despite this nice bonus, the WiFi card leaves a lot to be desired. The installed card is a first-wave WiFi AC Intel card from 2016, which is unexpected given how old that is and the upgraded ethernet port. As mentioned before, you could probably spend $30 to swap the card out for a new WiFi 6E card if you\u2019d like, but I would\u2019ve liked to see at very least a wave-two AC card pre-installed. This also means that the PC cannot connect to WPA3 networks, only WPA2 and below. Given that, I\u2019d only recommend using this PC with a wired ethernet connection. Apart from the connectivity, the CPU, RAM, and M.2 SSD all show-up with the advertised specs.I\u2019m not really happy with the hardware power settings for this PC. As mentioned before, the power button behaviour is not clear. Maybe there\u2019s a BIOS setting for the power button control, but it\u2019s not very intuitive in its default configuration (seems to turn the PC on but not off). Additionally, I\u2019ve run into a few times where the power light indicates the PC is on but it doesn\u2019t respond at all and seems to be in a weird power state (hibernate maybe? not sure here). Again, maybe this behaviour can be changed but with minimal info in the manual, I haven\u2019t had time to dig through the BIOS and figure it out.I tried to use the PC for a few things, and while it performed decently for basic tasks (web browsing, light video watching, etc), it leaves a fair bit to be desired. Despite being advertised as supporting \u201c4k@60Hz\u201d (which it does, if you modify a BIOS setting), it really does not perform well at anything above 1080@60Hz. The hardware video decoding is too slow to sustain the higher resolution and frame rate without dropping frames and causing major latency problems, which makes running Steam Link impossible. Dropping the resolution and refresh rate helps a bit, but it\u2019s still not great. I could see it working for strategy games or more casual games, but trying to stream Portal was painful.Finally, I\u2019m a bit disappointed in the thermal management of the PC. The included fan is indeed very quiet, but this comes at the cost of the PC getting quite hot when in-use. This seems to result in the PC throttling itself to keep temperatures down, and reducing the performance even more, which is disappointing.Overall, this is an okay mini PC for a limited set of applications (light browsing, thin client for a VM, etc.). The price ($258 CAD, with an extra $50 coupon available, at time of review) is not too bad for what you get, but I feel like it\u2019s less of a step-up from a cheap Raspberry Pi, given what I\u2019ll probably be able to use it for. I\u2019d probably not recommend this PC as an HTPC, except for 1080p video streaming only, but it may be okay in other applications.",
