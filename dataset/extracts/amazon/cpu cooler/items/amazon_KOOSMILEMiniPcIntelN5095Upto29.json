I just turned it on and I'm hearing that buzzing sound, I've never heard it before today; when I restart it, it goes away, but I'm still trying to figure out whats causing it. So I just decided to record it.Apart from that, it works great, its Windows 11 as stated and it doesn't over heat. I'm gave it a 4 star because of that buzzing.",

I hooked it up to my smart TV to stream YouTube TV. The TV's wifi capabilities were no longer able to deliver a smooth stream on some stations. The Mini receives the WIFI signal for the TV, delivering the data to the TV via the included HDMI cable without a hiccup. Setup was simple, and my only problem was my TV picture brightness dimmed significantly, and there was no brightness setting on the PC for the monitor. Finally discovered that the TV reverted to what it calls Standard Mode when I hooked the Mini up to it. Changed the TV's mode back to Dynamic, and all was perfect. I plan to get a small BT keyboard to handle any needed input from my easy chair, such as logging in or searching the internet. A small mouse is my TV remote.",
