                "reviewText": "I am reviewing the N95 16gb RAM 512gb SSD model in case it's unclear.4 cores, 4 threads - the N95 is actually fairly capable for what it is. I have used this model as a Proxmox node and as a desktop Linux machine, and it's pretty good for both. I haven't had any trouble with WIFI or Bluetooth on Linux using the 6.5 kernel.Adding a 2.5\" SATA SSD is very simple with this case - much easier than other MiniPCs I have opened.I think these are sometimes advertised as gaming PCs but you should research what you're getting if that's your intention. There are plenty of YouTube videos that benchmark the N95 against games. It can do some emulation and it can run some 2D indie titles from Steam that don't need 3D acceleration but any newer 3D game, even at 720p and lowest settings, will probably not be great. As a low-power, low-cost, and light-use home server or desktop it does the job, however. For me, this makes more sense as a 'way more powerful raspberry pi' than a 'way less powerful gaming PC'.The fan noise is definitely audible when it ramps up, but for simple desktop tasks you probably won't hear it much. The BIOS is pretty simple but easy to manage - I didn't have any trouble installing Proxmox / Linux with hardware virtualization.One thing to note is that I think the HDMI ports on it are an older spec. I was not able to get 4k/60hz out of it. It will do 4k/30hz, and 1440p/60hz. If I set it to 1080p I can get it up to 120hz.",

This mini marvel is an absolute powerhouse packed into a sleek, tiny form factor.The processor's performance is nothing short of spectacular. It handles tasks with lightning speed, making multitasking a breeze. From streaming to gaming, this mini PC delivers a smooth and lag-free experience. The 16GB RAM ensures that everything runs seamlessly, and the 512GB M.2 SSD provides ample storage with lightning-fast read and write speeds.Speaking of size, this mini computer is unbelievably compact. It's like having a high-performance computer that fits in the palm of your hand. Perfect for those tight spaces or if you simply want a clutter-free setup. The sleek design adds a touch of modern elegance to my workspace. I currently use 3 screens: a 24\" and 2, 22\" displays. It has no problem running Excel, Word, Chrome and Outlook across all three screens at the same time.Now, let me highlight the exceptional customer service that sets KAMRUI apart. After over a year of daily use, the built-in fan started making some noise. Concerned, I reached out to their customer support team. They responded promptly and were very engaging.What's truly remarkable is their commitment to customer satisfaction. Since they couldn't replace the fan, they went above and beyond by replacing the entire computer! Yes, you read that right \u2013 a brand new mini PC. Now, that's what I call exceptional service.In a world where customer service often falls short, KAMRUI has set a new standard. If you're in the market for a mini PC that combines stellar performance with top-notch customer support, look no further than the KAMRUI GK3 Plus. It's a game-changer!",

                "reviewText": "Nice compact, but powerful computer. It is pretty much ready to use, as it comes out of the box. You will only need to finish the Windows install process, which consists of a few questions to customize your installation to your keyboard, time zone, location, and end user login. If you DON'T want to have a password to enter each time you turn it on, you can leave the password item blank, after you have entered your username. You can always change to a having password later, but I don't think you can remove the password requirement if you fill it in at this time. This unit is quiet and small enough to tuck away, even behind your monitor via the included VESA mounting bracket. Wherever you place it remember that like all computers it will get warm, so be sure it has air space around it for the fan to circulate cooling air.It has Windows 11 pre-installed, which will work fine for 99% of the users. I wanted to use it for a media server in my RV, so I wanted to install Linux, which has more flexibility and is faster booting. On my first attempts, I entered the BIOS settings and changed the \"Display Delay\" setting. Unfortunately, it caused the display to not work, on either HDMI or VGA. I contacted customer service, and Kin, the rep., nicely replaced the unit under warranty. I did find out later that it would have been possible to clear the BIOS back to defaults, but with no display, that would have required opening the case and removing the motherboard, as the CMOS battery is underneath the MB. I can see why they would not trust the typical user with doing this.The pictures above show the Linux Mint 21.1 64 Bit install. I did it as a dual boot, just so that I would be able to access Win 11 if I wanted to. To do this, you need to have some experience with loading OS's on a computer, and working with BIOS settings. DO NOT attempt it if you have not done this before!To load Linux, you will need a bootable version on a USB drive. Plug in the thumbdrive, start the computer, then press the DEL key repeatedly. It should go into the BIOS settings. Leave all of the settings alone, except the following. Go to the SECURITY tab and select SECURE BOOT. Press enter and then go down until you reach SECURE BOOT. Press enter, and select DISABLE. go back up and go to the BOOT menu. The computer will see the thumbdrive and so you can select it as the 1st BOOT OPTION. Note, a thumbdrive must be present for the option to boot from USB to appear. It will not say USB, but will name the manufacturer of the drive that is plugged in. Do an F4 to save and close. Restart the computer and it should boot from the Linux on the USB. Follow the process as it boots. It will eventually have a working, but uninstalled version for you to try. At this point you can shutdown without making any changes to your computer if you don't want to install it. There will be the option to install showing on the desktop. Click on install and follow the prompts. At some point you will have the option to dual boot, which retains your Windows install, or to clear the drive and install Linux. If you opted for dual boot, it will partition the internal SSD to 2 parts splitting the space between Windows and Linux. Once this is done and the install is finished, it will reboot, and the option of Windows 11 or Linux will be shown during boot. Use the arrow keys to select which one, and press enter.",

Man braucht NICHT einen Adapter mit Spannungsumwandlung, das Netzteil kann 110 - 240V verdauen, diese einfachen Adapter sind auch nicht teuer.)- Einer der USB 3.x Ports ist tot, nicht funktioninsfaehig- Der N95 Intel CPU ist eine eigentlich nicht zu verkaufende Testversion (Engineering Sample CPU), die eigentlich noch Intel gehoert und den Computerfirmen nur leihweise zur Verfuegung gestellt wird.Diese Prozessor Version ist moeglicherweise fehlerhaft.(Nebenbei bemerkt hatte ich bewusst diesen MiniPC mit dem aelteren Intel N5105 bestellt, da dieser 2 RAM Channels unterstuetzt - ich erhielt jedoch das MiniPC Modell mit N95, der ein Upgrade darstellt durch insgesamt bessere Performance, aber nur 1 RAM Channel unterstuetzt und es dadurch bei Grafik zu Engpaessen kommen kann)",
