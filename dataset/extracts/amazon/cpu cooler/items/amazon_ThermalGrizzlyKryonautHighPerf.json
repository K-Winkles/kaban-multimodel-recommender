Thermal paste came in a syringe style container so it was super easy to apply. I'm not super computer oriented, but I do like to tinker and fix my own things. Months later my computer is running cool and the fan only really comes on if its charging and the battery gets warm. Before my laptop would reach upwards of 145F and now it usually runs around 105F. Definitely recommended",

I do not have to worry about the temps being in the 80's or 90's with this compound.The application was very simple even for a first timer like myself. It's very easy to push the paste out in the pattern you want. I went with the X pattern myself. The only issue is that it ran out of paste when I was finishing off the X pattern. There's only enough paste for one use so you gotta be sure of how you want to use this.Overall it's very good paste! The results deliver for sure.",

                "reviewText": "Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut The High Performance Thermal Paste is a game-changer when it comes to thermal management for electronic components. Here's my in-depth review:The Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut thermal paste lives up to its reputation of being high-performance. It provides exceptional heat transfer capabilities, effectively reducing temperatures and improving overall thermal efficiency. Whether you're overclocking your CPU or GPU, or simply seeking optimal cooling for your system, this thermal paste delivers impressive results.The application process is smooth and hassle-free. The included applicator makes it easy to apply the paste precisely without any mess. The paste spreads evenly, ensuring excellent contact between the heat source and the cooling solution.One notable advantage of Kryonaut is its longevity. It maintains its effectiveness over time, retaining its thermal conductivity without drying out or deteriorating. This is particularly valuable for those who prefer not to frequently reapply thermal paste.The thermal paste's non-conductive properties provide peace of mind when working with delicate components. It eliminates the risk of accidental short-circuits, allowing for worry-free installation and peace of mind.Although the price may be slightly higher compared to other thermal pastes on the market, the exceptional thermal performance and reliability justify the investment. The results speak for themselves, as Kryonaut helps maximize the potential of your cooling solution and ensures optimal performance under demanding conditions.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this paste for 3 different devices: an Asus G20CB desktop, an HP Pavilion desktop, and a 2021 Asus G14 laptop. After verifying that the paste was authentic, application was pretty straightforward and easy since it came with 2 different nib/spatula tips for the syringe of pate.I basically run stock after removing the bloat, no overclocks or anything, but I still wanted to repaste due to improvements to temps. Because of that the 2 desktops didn't see much difference, 3\u20136-degree Celsius give or take for the CPUs and GPUs. And even now, it is still holding the same temps as it did underload as it did when I 1st repasted it.My G14 however did see a sizeable improvement from what it originally had; CPU saw a 13 degree drop and GPU saw a 5-degree drop. I can't really say if it was because the factory liquid metal application was botched or just old, but this paste does well enough to keep the CPU from going past 85 degrees since before repasting my highs would sometimes reach 100 degrees and prevents my fans from turning into jet engines. It did last a good 13 months before temps are starting to slowly climb, so I will need to repaste soon. Will probably try Hyronaught this time since others reportedly say that it is better for laptop use due to higher idle and heavy load temps.Overall, it is an excellent product (if authentic, BEWARE OF FAKES). Yes, it is expensive, but the performance results do speak for itself and the reputation that it gained as a go-to by known overclockers is warranted; but it is ultimately up to you how much you value that improvement and if it is worth the price. For me however, despite not being an overclocker, it was worth every penny since lowering those operation and idle temps is just another way to have my last longer.",
