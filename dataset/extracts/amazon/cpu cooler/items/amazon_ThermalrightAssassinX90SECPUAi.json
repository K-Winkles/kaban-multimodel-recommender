                "reviewText": "This thing is AWESOME! It only cost ~$16 and better than the Basics one, which is really a rebranded Cooler Master. No RGB, but I didn't want any. It fits in my TT core V1 no problem. Comes with enough paste in plunger for 2, maybe 3 applications. Mounting was easy and comes with hardware for 1700, 1200/1151 and AMD. Looks GREAT, especially the black top plate. Fan cable black rubber.I love this cooler, so much better than the stock Intel and most downdraft ones. Maybe Noctua is better, but I like the look of TR more. Literally no cons, except if you want RGB.",
