                "reviewText": "Works great with my LGA1700 Intel i5-13600K. Easy to install once you identify the correct spacers. (Look carefully, they're labeled on the top.) The rear brace and spacers have to be mounted first from the backside of the motherboard, so make sure you put them on before you put the mobo in the case.The included thermal paste wasn't great so I scrapped it and used some better paste that I already had on hand. So pick some up when you order it (or a thermal pad).Fan is near silent and the ARGB motherboard sync is fun. First PC I've had that the CPU cooler syncs to music. \ud83d\ude02",

                "reviewText": "I planed on overclocking my CPU which was stock at 125W. When OC'd, the power needed was about 210 watts. This cooler is rated at 220 watts and fit the application perfectly. It was easy to install and left plenty of room around it. After OCing my motherboard, this cooler performed flawlessly. Most motherboards have the ability to ramp up the fan speed and the fan that comes with the cooler works great. If you need a cooler that can work with 220 watts loads, then this cooler is great.",

                "reviewText": "The cooler came with a defective screw, one of the screws used for mounting the cooler to the motherboard (AM4/AM5) was threaded incorrectly, making it so the cooler could not be mounted to the motherboard, so I contacted DeepCool and they stood by their product, offered to send me a replacement of the mounting kit, but since the replacement came from the factory in China, it would take about a month for it to arrive (full disclosure, I don't live in the US, I live in Colombia), so I decided to instead request the replacement directly through Amazon.About a week later I received my replacement, and immediately went over to install it. The process was pretty painless overall, and I'm really happy with the performance. I did not use the thermal paste it came with, but rather I used my own Arctic MX-4, and my Ryzen 7600 non x has been idling at around 42\u00b0C and gets to about 80-81\u00b0C under full load, running Cinebench R23 and drawing about 115W (PPT) with PBO turned on. This is compared to 50\u00b0C at idle and reaching TJMAX of 95\u00b0C and settling at 80W PPT during full load using the stock cooler.I do have to say, the fans get noticeably loud when running at 100% since they run at about 2000RPM, but of course, you can just set the fan curve to your liking so as to prevent this from happening, and besides, when gaming the CPU only gets to about 50-55\u00b0C so no real need to run the fans at more than 60% in most situations.I wish the QC had been better so I wouldn't have had to deal with the replacement process, but at least DeepCool was super attentive and responsive with my issue.Oh and I do realize I technically did put the cooler on upside down because of the deepcool logo, but the cooler is symmetrical and doesn't affect performance anyway lmao",

                "reviewText": "Performace: The stock cooler on my i5 6600 from 2016 was running all the time on high. Just simple web browsing had me regular hitting the 100C max, with basic tasks sitting around 60C. I thought the whole PC was kicking the can and started looking at upgrading my entire PC. Thought I'd give this <$30 cooler a try first before embarking on an expensive rebuild.Lo and behold, this cooler was a massive improvement. My PC now runs at <40C for nearly all tasks and intense gaming only hits ~75C, and to top it all off the cooler is completely silent. I keep my PC in my bedroom and this has made a huge improvement to my daily use.Installation: If you know your way around putting a PC together, this will be a breeze. The cooler comes with everything you need (except for screwdriver) to install this thing: a few plastic brackets to fit different CPU mounts, requisite hardware, spacers, screws, thermal paste. There is metal plate that fits over the CPU assembly. You add the thermal paste and screw the tower cooler right on top.Build Quality: This thing feels extremely sturdy and well built for the price. It blows the cheap stock plastic cooler out of the water.Overall extremely happy with this purchase.",
