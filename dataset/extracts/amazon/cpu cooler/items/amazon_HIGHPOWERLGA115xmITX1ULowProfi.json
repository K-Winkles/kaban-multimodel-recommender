Unlike the stock model, the thinner size enables it to fit in both Mini ITX & 1U cases. Efficient Cooling Despite the thin size, the LGA-115x-MITX contains a large 80mm fan to deliver effective and uncompromising cooling. Special Heatsink Design Full size CPU contact area provides uniform heat dissipation on the entire top side of your processor. The heat dissipation radiates evenly to all 4 sides allowing cool air to continuously push heat out directly from the top down. Silent Operation Setting the BIOS to silent mode enables the fan to spin at only 1000 RPM. Noise level is low and quiet during normal system operation without sacrificing performance.",

                "reviewText": "Pretty great little heat-sink and fan. Relevant system specs:CPU: I5 3475SMB: EMB-B75ACase: Weird Acrylic \"thing\" off AliExpressI was looking for a cheap-ish CPU cooler, for a mini build, in a mini case... this did the trick. Great fan and heat-sink and at half the cost of the equivalent Noctua L9.Pros: great fan and heat-sink on a budget. Keeps the processor fairly cool. Idle (doing nothing) ~33C; normal usage (Netflix, Gmail, etc) ~ 40-45C; higher usage (games, etc) 55-60C. Not bad considering the price. I would have liked a few degrees cooler considering this is an \"S\" series CPU, but not terrible. I could probably knock off a few degrees with a Noctua L9 but at twice the cost and the L9 might not have fit my case, as it is just a touch bigger.Cons: honestly not many. I did notice that the fan is not silent, not overly loud, but not silent. Under load the fan is audible but not to the point of distraction. Oddly, the fan is quieter at a horizontal position than a vertical one... not sure why. The only other con is the coil-whine... yeah it is there; I did hear an audible coil-whine when I first started using this... it went away after about a week, but for a time I thought I was going mad... give it time and the coil-whine dissipates permanently (the whine is from the springs holding the sink to the board, I think).Overall, worth it!Just a note: I have seen reviews say they are using this for I7 CPUs and the like... I personally would not after the temps on my \"S\" series processor, but for lower watt CPUs, this is a good deal.",

Then, HP support couldn't sell me a replacement - they said I should be able to find one online. I'll never buy another HP again. But, after looking at all the specs on the original HP fan and the CPU, I determined that this one should fit. It did and my HP is running again. I guess I'll get a few more miles out of the HP.The fan works great and is quiet.",
