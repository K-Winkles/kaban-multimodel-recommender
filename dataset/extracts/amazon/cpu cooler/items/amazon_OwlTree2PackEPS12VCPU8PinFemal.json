                "reviewText": "I built a rig to use a mix of new and used parts for sale, and had a used motherboard with a dual 8-pin connection and an inexpensive but good PSU that has only a single 8-pin connector that was also a bit short for the mid-tower case, preventing my preferred cable routing. So this adapter was MUCH cheaper than a more expensive PSU or smaller case. The new motherboard did boot with only one 8-pin connector, but two is obviously preferred. It took literally a few minutes to install, solving both the connector and the cable routing problem. Plus it is a two-pack, so I have a spare for future use.",

                "reviewText": "I've tested it with an Dell Optiplex 3020 project, Aaaand...... Yeah.. not bad at all, it's good for CPU 6 pin to 4 pin swap only.. I don't know if for others that works for the ATX too but not mine.. Like it got not enough juice for doing CPU and ATX power.. BUT I've tested and made some searching on web.. It's just because the 6 pin full power is splitted into the 4 pin and the 6 pin ATX too.. So the 6 pin ATX got not enough voltage for start the pc. So i've just vanishing the 6 pin ATX with electric black tape.My advice for people having the same problem PSU swap, just go get this CPU swap and get the 24 pin to 6 pin swap with the resistor one on the cable *That's very important when you making swap cable plugs or it could get burn* both working together. It will give you the CPU fan error but it's okay, just F1 on it. Everything's works fine.The cable don't burn or misfire.All test done and it's not the best 5 stars but it's great 4 stars !",
