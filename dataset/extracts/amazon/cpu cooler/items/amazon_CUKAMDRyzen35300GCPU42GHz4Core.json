This part is originally OEM only so none of the chips are 100% 'new' but they have gone through multiple QA processes. The Wraith cooler I received had a defective fan. I can't hold that against CUK, that happens. I ordered a way more amazing cooler which wasn't a problem for me at all. I'm sure CUK would have replaced it if I would have asked.",

I have it installed in my travel / testing rig, and it is more than capable of keeping me gaming on the go. Could also be the heart of a DIY NAS, or an office productivity system.",

Be aware, it was an OEM only item originally, and my Asrock MoBo did not list it as compatible, but ASUS and MSI did, and it worked for me in my Asrock B450 mother board. You get 4 cores and 8 threads (as compared to 8/16 for the 5700, but it can be less than 1/2 the price, so you can get into this CPU for about $80 right now. a 4/8 core/thread 4100 without the graphics is only $10 cheaper. The video output did not work with the motherboard I was using, but I have not updated the drivers yet, and everything else is working and I am using a GPU anyways.",
