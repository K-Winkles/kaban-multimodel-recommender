                "reviewText": "The Be Quiet Pure Rock 2 Slim is an aesthetically good looking unit. It's quite affordable compared to other comparable products from other vendors. It cools up to 130 Watts TDP, so make sure you check your CPU's TDP Wattage to make sure this cooler can handle it. Thermal paste is pre-applied and the default brackets setup is for AM4 AMD CPU's. They do include brackets for Intel CPU's, but it's a less eloquent mounting system than the default AMD mounting system. It comes with a 92mm fan, which helps with its compact size but still affords great (and quiet) cooling, airflow and overall performance. This product would not be good for extreme overclockers as you could potentially exceed the maximum TDP Wattage this fan is rated for. However, if you either leave your rig stock or even do mild overclocking, this fan should be more than sufficient for your needs - and at a very affordable price.",

                "reviewText": "This cooler replaced a severely underperforming Intel heatsink that came with the 9400. It's for my \"hackintosh\" which sports said chip (i5 9400). Day to day tasks were fine with the included cooler but for rendering video or doing anything else that was CPU intensive, the stock cooler would spool up and sound like an electric leaf blower. This cooler took that problem and stomped it flat.The CPU and this cooler are on a Gigabyte Z390 Designaire motherboard (nice board and it has thunderbolt too!) along with 32 GB of RAM. It runs dead silent and is very responsive.For installation, it wasn't too bad, just a little tedious. But that's with most coolers, really. It does involve taking both panels off of your case (each side) to access the back of the motherboard in order to fit the cooler's back plate. The instructions provided are adequate enough.You can probably get more bang for your $ by going with Thermalright but I don't know how quiet their coolers are compared to Be Quiet's. But it's definitely that: QUIET!It's best to chunk those stock coolers to the side and spend a little extra dough to get a good cooler so that you won't think your computer is about to grow wings and take off.",

I do think that if you can install RAM or a gfx card, you can do this, too.It comes with thermal compound already applied. Some will be happy with that, and others will likely remove it and apply their own. To each there own, I suppose.This thing is super quiet and works very well. Obviously, I'll need to look at how things are going in a few months, but for right now, brand new, super clean, my CPU idles at around 25c and while gaming is around 50c. That is a big improvement over my old temps!",

                "reviewText": "I have an ITX-Mini industrial type all-in one ultra-slim open air mesh frame chassis & motherboard with an i7-4790S cpu, that has been a beast to tame workload heat, in this smallest of form-factor chassis, in an open to the elements temperature environment, and much to much dismay, and satisfaction, the Be Quite! Pure Rock LP finally solved my CPU heat throttling problems.The original OEM installed CPU cooler was essentially the basic original Intel aluminum lug & fin, topped with a fan, reference CPU cooler, but cut down to very low 37+mm profile to fit in an ultra-slim desktop chassis.Searching for better replacements I found the Noctua NH-L9i cooler was a few mm's tool tall to fit in the chassis, and that it had height tolerances problems in the CPU clearance zone underneath the CPU cooler.An ARCTIC Alpine 12 LP did fit the clearance issues, and had lower noise, and power use; however still being based on an aluminum lug & fin design, (no heat pipes), still was not able to keep up with sustained temperatures, under even moderate loads.When Be Quite announced their new LP cooler and that it was a copper heat pipe design, fit into the most minimal/maximal dimensions limits allowed for CPU cooler tolerance zones, and could tame even newer generation CPU's, I was skeptical. But as a still last ditch resort to keep a workhorse computer thermally tamed, I decided to purchase one, give a try, with the clearance issues, see if I could even get it installed, and if it could improve on the Alpine LP.Mission successful !!!The install was razor shave close cut; not even micro-micrometers to spare in clearance tolerance all the way around, after mounting; from the top of the fan just barely touching the chassis cover, and with the CPU cold plate fit and around & underneath the cooler; including the cooler and mounting bracket just barely fit over a row of power capacitors sitting just below the bracket. The mounting certainly is \"flexible\" but this turned out to be a benefit, after getting the mounting brackets and screws tightened into place.The bracket installation wrench provided & needed to tighten the CPU mounting bolts, (not the mounting screws), had some difficulty getting around tight part clearances, that were right up and into the CPU cooler clearance zone, but I was able to work the wrench enough to secure the mounting bolts to the brackets; then tighten the mounting screws.After turning the system back on, immediately I noticed a 10-20 deg F. reduction, as compared to typical temps with the Alpine LP. And even with now spring summer temperatures coming on, and the ability to cool the cpu is being impacted by increase in ambient air temps, the Be Quit! LP has continued to maintain the heat dissipation, through all load testing; most notably that CPU is staying below throttle temperatures where; the OEM installed could never do, and Alpine LP could barely keep up with!Additionally noticed is that the noise level was way down, even at full RPM the Be Quit! Any fan noise had a slight low hum winy noise, but only noticeable at maximum RPM.Overall, this CPU cooler solved a long and ongoing cooling problem in a very minimalist chassis install, and it does it with no no high speed fans, or related added noise.",
