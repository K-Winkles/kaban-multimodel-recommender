                "reviewText": "I had a cooling pump begin to fail on a Ryzen 7 3700X, but I thought it was the thermal paste not making enough contact or being contaminated. Turned out the pump finally failed. This was the closest to my original, which had decent reviews. Got it overnight, to install it the next day. Great price.Installation - mounting four screws through the motherboard was not as easy as it looks. It was a bit of a struggle, but don't overtighten until all four are securely in the mounting holes.The instructions are good but very simplistic. It would be a good idea to photograph the board so you can see where all the leads go. The instructions do not match the labels for some boards.Once it's installed, turn on the CPU and check the temps - it should be between 31c - 45c. The fans are super quiet. I use this computer for my film and voice-over editing, and the slight hum from the fans is not picked up when recording. Overall I'm pleased, but mounting the pump needs a little bit of improving.",

If you\u2019re capable of following simple instructions and understanding what pictures mean then the install will be easy. I had it installed and running in a little less than 45 minutes. It made a dramatic difference compared to the air cooler. Idle temps on a i7-9700k were steady at 28 degrees C. Heavy gaming in 1440 like Horizon the temps never went above 55 C. Great cooler especially at a 55 dollar clip. I HIGHLY recommend it. It\u2019s also true RGB. Lots of different color choices and a few different cycle choices. You just need a case with a button for LED control or just use your reset switch to control it. The short 3-pin PWM connector coming from the water block can be plugged into any fan header on your motherboard. No need for extensions",
