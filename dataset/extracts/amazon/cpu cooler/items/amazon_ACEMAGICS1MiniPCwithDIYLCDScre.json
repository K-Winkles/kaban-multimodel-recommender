                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. NOTE: This review is for the Acemagic model S1 Mini PC.There was a time in the past where I really didn't like Mini PCs very much. The CPUs that they came with were necessarily slow in order to fit into such small enclosures without generating excessive heat. However, this new Acemagic S1 Mini PC makes use of the new N95 CPU from Intel which completely changes the game.If you are not familiar with the new N series CPUs from Intel, these are the replacements for what used to be the Celeron and Pentium series of CPUs. I can see why Intel wanted to change the name of this series of CPUs; it's because these CPUs are very different from those previous CPUs. The N95 makes use of the new 12th Generation CPU architecture by utilizing four of the new \"Efficiency\" cores rather than having only two cores as previous CPUs had. Those efficiency cores make a big difference. You get much better performance while still sipping power. This is not just a difference on paper. It is very much noticeable in everyday usage. I used to always find myself annoyed at the sluggishness of Mini PCs, but this system is different. It zips along very nicely, and everything feels smooth and responsive.No, you are not going to run high-end, demanding games on a system like this, but that is not what a system like this is intended for. But for all of those tasks that I perform on a daily basis - checking e-mail, browsing the web, running office applications - it all just runs smoothly and fluidly.Now, let's look at some of the unique features of this system...The first thing that jumps out at you is the fact that this little powerhouse has a screen built right into the front of the system. Now, that's pretty slick, but if it serves no other purpose than to display an image then you might think that this is just a gimmick. Thankfully, Acemagic has chosen to implement control software for this screen that allows you to display some very useful system information. The screen can also be configured to display in either the vertical or horizontal orientations and the system comes with a stand to allow stable vertical orientation.Below, or to the right of the screen is a small RGB lighbar. Again, software is provided to allow customization. I'm not a fan of overdone RGB everywhere, but this is very subtle without being overdone at all. I find that it looks very good without being at all obnoxious.It's also very clear that Acemagic put thought into easy accessibility to the inside of this system. The base snaps on with magnets, and so does the side panel. It will literally take you five seconds to pop off that panel with no tools needed and have easy access to the inside. My video shows just how incredibly simple this is to do.Once inside, you will find simple access to the system RAM as well as the two M.2 slots for storage. Be aware that one of these slots will accommodate either an NVMe drive or a SATA M.2 SSD while the other will accommodate a SATA M.2 SSD only. The system ships with 16 GB of RAM and either one 512 GB NVMe SSD or one 1 TB NVMe SSD depending upon the configuration that you choose.On the back panel, you will find the power connector, two HDMI ports and two gigabit Ethernet ports as well as a headset jack and a lock slot. I realize that not everyone is going to run multiple monitors or need multiple Ethernet ports, but having those options available, especially at the price point of this system, is a really nice touch and just adds to the versatility of this system. On the left side of the system, you will find 2 USB 2.0 ports and 2 USB 3.0 ports. WiFi 5 and Bluetooth 4 are also included. It is also worth noting that the version of Windows that ships with this system is Windows 11 PRO, not just the Home Edition.Special use case: I thought that I would perform a test that would really push the CPU, and that is video compression. To my surprise, this CPU breezed through video compression because this CPU includes the Intel QuickSync hardware compression. If you do a lot of video compression, this would be a very budget frienly way of doing that. I was able to compress about 1 hour of 1920 x 1080 high-definition video to H.265 in just a few minutes. Impressive!I also wanted to see what Technical Support was like for this system because I had a few questions that I wanted to ask. I was very happy to find that they were highly responsive both by phone and on their web site. They also have a number of resources readily available to users. On their forum they have the following items available for download:A complete factory image so that you can easily restore the system should you ever need to do so.The LED control software (if you are planning to perform a clean install of Windows).The screen control software (if you are planning to perform a clean install of Windows).At the time of my writing this review, the latest version of Windows 11, version 23H2 had just been released 2 days ago. I wanted to make sure that it would run without difficulty on this system. I did both an upgrade installation as well as a full clean install and both worked flawlessly.In conclusion, I'm really happy with this purchase. If you are looking at Mini PCs, this is one that is well worth the money. It comes well equipped right out of the box, but it's clear that thought went into supporting us hobbyists with east serviceability and the proper resources available to perform your own clean installations.",

This mini PC is perfect for my everyday needs.It seems as if modern displays have all kinds of different labels: high definition, 3D, smart, 4K, 4K Ultra, the list goes on. The two most common labels are LCD and LED. What\u2019s the difference between the two? Is there a difference? And does this difference make one or the other preferable for certain types of activities like gaming or graphic design?Are LED and LCD the same thing?All LED monitors are LCD monitors. But not all LCD monitors are LEDs. Kind of like all eagles are birds, but not all birds are eagles. While the names might be confusing to those wading through specs to find the best monitor, once you break it down it\u2019s easier to understand than you think.We\u2019ll explain the tech and the naming conventions, and then highlight some HP monitors that might be the perfect fit for your needs. Let\u2019s figure out exactly what LCD and LED monitors are and how to pick the right one for you.Liquid crystal display explainedBoth types of displays use liquid crystals to help create an image. The difference is in the backlights. While a standard LCD monitor uses fluorescent backlights, an LED monitor uses light-emitting diodes for backlights. LED monitors usually have superior picture quality, but they come in varying backlight configurations. And some backlight configurations create better images than others.LCD monitor vs. LED monitor - a brief historyUntil 2014, plasma displays were the most commonly manufactured displays. But then the LCD took over. LCD stands for liquid crystal display. We\u2019ll go over what that means in a minute. But first, it\u2019s important to note that an LED also uses liquid crystals, so the name is somewhat misleading. Technically, an \u201cLED monitor\u201d should really go by the name, \u201cLED LCD monitor.\u201dHow LCD technology worksFirst, let\u2019s go over how LCD and LED monitors utilize liquid crystals. The science behind this stuff features an incredibly complicated mix of optics, electrical engineering, and chemistry. But we\u2019ll explain it in layman\u2019s terms.LIQUID CRYSTALSThe key term here is \u201cliquid crystal.\u201d In high school, you might have been taught that there are three states of matter: solids, liquids, and gases. But there are some substances that are actually a strange blend of different states. A liquid crystal is a substance that has properties of both a solid and a liquid. When you get to the upper tiers of science, you begin to discover that everything you once knew is wrong.Solid properties: The molecules in the liquid crystal can form a simple, highly geometric shapeLiquid properties: The molecules in the liquid crystal can also have a fluid, unstructured shapeTypically, the molecules in a liquid crystal are bunched up in a very dense and unstructured arrangement. But when the liquid crystal is exposed to electricity, the molecules suddenly expand into a very structured, interconnected shape [1].PIXELS Every pixel is composed of three color filters, which are called \u201csubpixels.\u201d There\u2019s a red, blue, and green subpixel for every pixel [1].HOW LCD DISPLAYS WORKEvery pixel is composed of two glass sheets, and the outermost sheet has the subpixels. The liquid crystals are sandwiched between the two sheets.LCD monitors have backlights behind the screen that emit white light, and the light can\u2019t pass through the liquid crystals while they\u2019re in their liquid arrangement. But when the pixel is in use, the monitor applies an electric current to the liquid crystals, which then straighten out and allow light to pass through them [2].Every pixel has three separate backlights which can shine through the red, blue, or green color filter \u2013 that\u2019s how a pixel can emit a specific color.STRUCTURE OF AN LCD SCREENHere\u2019s how an LCD is structured from the back (furthest from you) to the front (closest to you):BacklightsSheet #1Liquid CrystalSheet #2, with color filtersScreenTypes of backlightingWhile both LCD and LED monitors make use of liquid crystals, it\u2019s the backlighting that really makes them different from one another [2].LCD BACKLIGHTINGStandard LCD monitors employ \u201ccold cathode fluorescent lamps,\u201d also known as CCFLs as backlights. These fluorescent lights are evenly placed behind the screen so that they deliver consistent lighting across the display. All regions of the picture will have similar brightness levels.LED BACKLIGHTINGLED monitors don\u2019t use fluorescent lamps. Instead, they use \u201clight-emitting diodes,\u201d which are extremely small lights. There are two methods of LED backlighting: full-array backlighting and edge lighting.Full-array backlightingWith full-array backlighting, the LEDs are placed evenly across the entire screen, similar to an LCD setup. But what\u2019s different is that the LEDs are arranged in zones. Each zone of LED lights can be dimmed (also known as local dimming).Local dimming is a very important feature that can dramatically improve picture quality. The best images are ones that have a high contrast ratio; in other words, images that have both very bright pixels and very dark pixels simultaneously.When there\u2019s an area of the picture that needs to be darker (a night sky, for instance), the LEDs in that region of the picture can be dimmed to create a truer black. This is not possible on standard LCD monitors, where the entire picture is lit evenly throughout.With local dimming, the monitor can create more precise illumination, which results in greater picture quality.Edge lightingSome LED monitors have edge lighting. This is where LEDs are placed along the edge of the screen rather than behind it. The LEDs can be placed:Along the bottom of the screenAlong the top and bottom of the screenAlong the left and ride sides of the screenAlong all four sides of the screenThere are no local dimming capabilities in edge-lighted displays, so they can\u2019t create pictures that are as high-quality as those created by full-array LEDs. However, edge lighting enables manufacturers to create extremely thin displays that don\u2019t cost as much to produce - and which are better for a tight budget.Comparing LCD to LEDWhen it comes to picture quality, full-array LED monitors are almost always superior to LCD monitors. But bear in mind that only full-array LEDs are superior. Edge-lit LEDs may actually be inferior to LCD monitors.WHICH IS BETTER FOR GAMING, LCD OR LED?A full-array LED monitor should be your number one choice for gaming. Steer clear of its edge lighting. The problem with edge lighting is that you\u2019ll have fewer optimal viewing angles with which to play games. That\u2019s not an issue if you prefer to sit directly in front of the screen while you\u2019re gaming. But if you like to kick back in your chair or view from different angles, you\u2019ll find that an edge-lit LED loses visibility as you move away from the center viewing angle.But even if you play while you\u2019re directly in front of the monitor, edge-lit LEDs have more issues with glare than full-array LEDs do. That\u2019s because of the uneven lighting (very bright around the edges, darker as you approach the center of the display). Because the pixels are evenly lit, LCD monitors tend to have better viewing angles and anti-glare than edge-lit LEDs.EDGE-LIT LEDS ARE BETTER FOR A TIGHT SPACE AND BUDGETEdge-lit LEDs do have two big advantages. If you have a very tight space in which to fit your monitor, you\u2019ll like having an edge-lit LED because they\u2019re usually thinner than the other types. They\u2019re also less expensive to manufacture, which make them easier on the wallet.DON\u2019T FORGET ABOUT THE SPECSWhen you\u2019re shopping for a new display, don\u2019t forget to review all of its specs. While the backlighting type is important, you should also take the resolution and refresh rate into account.Resolution refers to how many pixels are displayed on the monitor. Remember, the more pixels you have, the more dynamic your composition of colors can be. The highest-quality monitors have resolutions of at least 1920x1080.Refresh rate refers to how quickly your monitor updates the display with new information from your computer\u2019s GPU. If you\u2019re a gamer, it\u2019s important that you get a monitor with a very fast refresh rate (30 Hz to 60 Hz) so you won\u2019t suffer from screen tearing - a nasty visual effect that happens when your monitor can\u2019t keep pace with the GPU.HP LED monitors: IPA vs AHVABecause LED monitors create better pictures than LCD monitors, nearly all of HP\u2019s displays are built with LED backlights. When you\u2019re browsing through the HP LED monitors, you might notice that some of them are equipped with either \u201cIPS\u201d or \u201cAHVA\u201d technology. These refer to the types of liquid crystal panels that are used. Both are fantastic, although they have some minor differences:IPS: Better color production and viewing anglesAHVA: Better refresh rates and contrast ratiosStill, many consumers believe that there is little to no discernible difference between the two [3].You\u2019ll also see that some monitors have \u201cTN\u201d LED backlights. This is the oldest form of liquid crystal technology. It\u2019s still very effective, but TN panels are typically used in small, work-oriented monitors that are made to be mounted or used in the field.LED MONITORS YOU SHOULD CHECK OUTThese top-of-the-line HP LED monitors are among the best of the best. Give them a quick look if you\u2019re in the market for a new display.For the gamer The future: OLED and QLEDThere are some up-and-coming technologies that are making LED displays even better. OLED and QLED displays are bound to become more commonplace in the future.OLED MONITORS\u201cOLED\u201d stands for \u201corganic light-emitting diode.\u201d What makes an OLED unique is that each pixel has a light source that can be individually shut off. On an LED monitor, the only way to keep a pixel from emitting light is to keep the liquid crystal closed. It\u2019s effective, but not perfect - a small portion of light will always seep through. On an OLED monitor, each pixel\u2019s light can be entirely shut off, so no light at all will emanate through the liquid crystal. These means you can get truer blacks, which means deeper contrast ratios and better image quality.There are two additional advantages. First, OLED monitors can be made even thinner than LED monitors because there\u2019s not a separate layer of LEDs behind the pixels. Second, these monitors are more energy efficient because the pixels will only draw power when their light is turned on. One of the downsides, though, is that pixel burn-in will be more noticeable since some pixels will inevitably be used more than others [4].QLED MONITORS\u201cQLED\u201d stands for \u201cquantum light-emitting diode.\u201d In a QLED monitor, each pixel has a \u201cquantum dot.\u201d Quantum dots are tiny phosphor particles that glow when you shine a light upon them [5].Why would you need a glowing particle over each pixel? Because LEDs aren\u2019t very good at emitting bright light. The brightest color is white. But an LED doesn\u2019t emit white light \u2013 it emits blue light. Each LED is given a yellow phosphor coating to make it appear less blue and more white, but it\u2019s still not true white. The \u201cblueness\u201d of LEDs negatively impacts the red, blue, and green colors on LED displays. LED monitors have automatic features that adjust the RGB colors to compensate for the blue light, but it can\u2019t compensate for the weaker light intensity.That\u2019s where the quantum dots come in. The pixels are overlayed by a sheet of red and green quantum dots (there is no blue because blue light is already being emitted by the LED). When the light shines through the liquid crystals, the quantum dots glow, and you\u2019re given a bright, vivid, and lovely spectrum of RGB colors.QLED monitors are capable of creating pictures that are both dynamic and bright, and which have stellar contrast ratios.The chip is a 15-watt processor with 4 Gracemont CPU cores that support frequencies up to 3.4 GHz, Intel UHD graphics with 16 execution units and support for speeds up to 1.2 2GHz, and 6MB of cache.Officially the processor only supports up to 16GB of DDR4, DDR5, or LPDDR5 memory, but PC makers have been shipping mini PCs with more RAM than Intel\u2019s budget chips officially support for years.Intel\u2019s Alder Lake-N processors are low-cost, low-power chips that are basically what you get if you combine the Efficiency cores from the company\u2019s 12th-gen Alder Lake-U processors with Intel UHD graphics, while leaving out any Performance cores.Compared with previous-gen Celeron and Pentium chips based on Intel\u2019s Atom architecture, the new processors should deliver significant CPU and graphics performance gains while operating at similar power levels. The first mini PCs powered by Alder Lake-N chips have started to arrive, and I recently spotted a new model sporting a previously unannounced Intel Processor N95.The Intel Processor N95 is an entry-level mobile CPU for thin and light laptops from the Alder Lake-N series. It was announced in early 2023 and offers no performance cores and 4 of the 8 efficient cores (E-cores, Gracemont architecture). The chip does not support HyperThreading and clocks with up to 3.4 GHz. The performance of the E-cores should be similar to old Skylake cores (compare to the Core i7-6700HQ). All cores can use up to 6 MB L3-cache. Compared to the similar Processor N100, the N95 offers a slightly higher TDP and therefore maybe a slightly improved sustained performance.PerformanceThe average N95 in our database is in the same league as the Pentium 7505 and the Core i3-1115G4, as far as multi-thread benchmark scores are concerned. That's not a great result, to put it mildly.Your mileage may vary depending on how high the CPU power limits are and how competent the cooling solution of your system is.FeaturesThe Alder Lake-N chips only support single channel memory with up to DDR5-4800, DDR4-3200 or LPDDR5-4800. The chip also supports Quick Sync and AV1 decoding (most likely same engine as in Alder Lake). Furthermore, Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 are partly integrated (but no Thunderbolt). External chips can be connected via PCIe Gen3 x9 (via the PCH).The integrated graphics adapter is based on the Xe-architecture and offers only 16 of the 32 EUs (Execution Units) operating at only 1200 MHz. Due to the single channel memory, low clock speeds, and low shader count, the gaming performance of the iGPU is very limited.Power consumptionThe N95 has a base power consumption of 12 W (compared to the 6 W of the N100) and is therefore well suited for thin and light systems. The CPU is built with a further improved 10nm SuperFin process at Intel (called Intel 7)",
