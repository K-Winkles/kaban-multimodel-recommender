                "reviewText": "I bought a pre-built a couple of weeks ago and it came with a super cheap CPU cooler that needed replacing. I didn't really want to spend an arm and a leg because this AMD 3700x isn't going to get overclocked and even with the stock cooler temps were in the high, but acceptable, operating range. Anyway, I saw this one and it's aRGB matched the rainbow puke on of the front of my case, video card, and fans, and it didn't break the back so I decided to pull the trigger.First off, this was probably the easiest of any cooler I've ever installed. My only complaint, which they've addressed in a couple of YouTube videos, is that the AMD4 socket installation is just a top and bottom hinge, while the Intel installations use all four sides. It sounds worse than it is, because you can clip it right to the motherboard, it needs no backplate or removing of the back side of the case, and it literally took me less than 5 minutes to install. Once it's tightened down and firmly in place, it's not going anywhere, so the 2 hinge complaint is minor at most.The beauty of AIO's, even cheap ones, is that even if they don't cool any better than better air coolers, they take up significantly less room around the CPU. The best air coolers are giant monsters the size of a softball, that's why I went AIO. As you can see from my attached photo, everything is nice and clean with plenty of room to breathe.Anyway, on to the temps. This case is absolutely tiny. It's a good 3 inches shorter than my other PC which has a Phanteks Eclipse P300, which isn't a large case to begin with, so I wasn't expecting miracles. I've been pleasantly surprised. I got 5 settings for CPU fan speed on my motherboard, and on the 3rd or 5, which I find a good compromise of temp/noise, I idle at ~35c and at typical load it's ~55-60c. The stock cooler ran at ~60c idle and around 85c at load, so quite a nice improvement. There's also the benefit of a much quieter system. If I cranked up the fan speed on this I could most certainly hit even lower temps, but these are well below what they need to be and I think the noise reduction means more than a few Celsius less.For $70, which is what I paid, I think it's a good product. It's only been installed for about a week now, so I can't speak to longevity, and will definitely update my review if anything changes, but so far, so good. I'd definitely recommend it if you are looking for an AIO on the cheaper side, especially if you are looking for one with aRGB, which are usually fairly expensive. If rainbow puke isn't your thing, you can probably find other models that are in the price/perfomance range that will suit your needs just as well.A for installation, looks, and price. B for performance. Overall, a decent piece of hardware.",

                "reviewText": "Decided to take a chance on this AIO due to a mixture of its low price, included ARGB capability, and fairly consistently positive reviews. Upon unboxing, it looked to be fairly high quality. The radiator is a bit thin, but, comparable to other similar offerings. The tubing seems solid and the sleeving on the tubes is of good quality. The pump/cpu block looked to be of good quality as well. Instructions weren't that clear, but, I've installed many an AIO, and this one will install fairly typically to most other coolers for those with some experience in doing so (swappable brackets for AMD/ Intel. Loop bracket for AMD and screw bracket for Intel, etc.). Everything lined up well, with no fitment issues ok the radiator or pump end, nor with any of the included screws and brackets. As far as function, there was the bit of typical fluid gurgle initially, as the fluid began circulation through the loop, but it quickly went away. Temps sit right around 30c idle on my Ryzen 5 3600 with temps at about 60c under load, stock settings. Definitely fit my expectations, and performs well. As far as looks, I'd say this is where it definitely sits above its price range. The AIO looks slick, and the RGB on both the pump block and the included fans is quite nice, and addressable to boot (a feature you'd be hard pressed to find at this price point). I've got the AIO, as well as the rest of my ARGB fans hooked to an ARGB hub and it syncs well with the rest of my set-up and looks great. We'll see how it stands up over time, but, first impressions are very good. Would recommend as a fantastic budget option that seems to stand well with offerings closer to the $100+ range.",

Outperforms my 160W TDP air cooler by 5\u00b0C and stays relatively silent while doing it.",

The screws are ALL plated dark shiny finish that look great and seem high quality. The fans have a very solid housing with really nice rubber footings. All of the screws connected with ease (this is always where I judge quality, when screws need to be forced in).The pump does produce a low amount noise at 100%, but setting 90% in bios makes it 100% silent. I have it bump up to 100% at 75 degrees.The fans run as well as any good quality fans do, and the ARGB control works great with my setup.The cables are a little long for my set up, but I cannot complain for the price.I'm running a i7-10700K 4.2GHz overclocked to 5GHz and running a full Cinebench benchmark tops out around 80 degrees. Which is great for a 100% load stress test. I imagine it would run even lower temps if I didn't have any step ups for fans and pumps.Impressed so far but its only been a day. I will update if anything changes.Update: I wanted to come back to this review, I've had it running with pretty heavy gaming use for almost 4 months and its still very solid.",
