And to top it all off, they then proceeded to ship it via UPS Surepost (economy shipping) across the country which took six days. I never expected to be waiting half a month from ordering to the day it arrived at my door. Ridiculous.As for the product itself, it's nice. Super easy to install, performs well, and the RGB lighting on the fan looks great. It's everything you could want from a modern CPU air cooler.*PLEASE READ* As of 11/22/2022 this listing is mislabeled. Selecting and adding the RGB version will actually add the regular version to your cart and vice versa. I almost didn't catch it in time prior to the order shipping.",

I ended up just swapping out the non RGB fan for a Corsair iCue one and it worked great. Put the plain white fan in the back for double airflow.",

I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s a listing issue or something else. It says $59.99 before sales discounts which is the correct price for the rgb version but this listing is for the non rgb.In terms of performance I\u2019ve not gone over 50c as of 1 hour into a gaming session with high settings so this things works spectacularly.",

Either use the 3 pin ARGB adapter that comes with the cooler or plug it into the NZXT fan hub if u have one.Go for it if you have a mid end cpu. For high end cpu it will work, but I recommend going for an AIO or dual heat sink cooler.",
