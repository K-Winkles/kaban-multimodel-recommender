                "reviewText": "Installing was simple, but you need to take it slow and watch where the screws are at or it could scratch the PCB. My old cooler is a Noctua nh-l9i so I will compare from it for this review. Cooling in idle is 34c the same as the Noctua in Gaming the temps get no hotter that 65c (non CPU dependent games avg. was 56c) same as Noctua. Torture Testing with Prime95 for 15 minutes did get the temps on some cores to go to 78c which is 5c hotter, but well below the 100c threshold for the I7-8700 used so that is good. Fan noise is actually just a tad noisier when compared the Noctua which surprised me the most in a good way I was expecting a louder fan but pretty quiet for a cheap cooler. RGB lights are bright for a 4 point lighting colors are good, but for RGB Fusion Motherboards you will need either a 2.0 board or a controller hub for effects or you can use the included hub for limited effects. Height issues you have 45.5 mm clearance for RGB RAM, or tall heatsinks anything above 36 mm will require you to remove heatsink fist before installing or removing safely. With the temps I got in a well ventilated case I would only recommend this for CPUs that are not overclocked (non K mostly) so 85W TDP (65W for ITX Builds) CPUs (third gen or above) if you don't want the CPU going over 90c. I bought this for the RGB lighting and the price. This is overall a great product for the price, but as said earlier take it slow with the install and watch the screws while installing so you do not scratch the PCB.",

I was surprised when I unboxed the unit that the surface area was so small, smaller than my CPU but decided to try it anyways. I will be returning it and getting the watercooled unit I was originally going to use.Update, did not work out with my cpu, it just ran too hot under heavy load. Unfortunately, I had to return it.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not running any kind of overclocked monstrosity. I just have a simple, sleeper build. Basically it's a consumer-grade Acer mini tower with a micro ATX compact form gigabyte motherboard, i7-8700 processor, 64GB of 2666Mhz DDR4, and a 2TB NVMe drive running things. For graphics I'm running a Nvidia 2070 Super card.It's a lot of horsepower in a very tiny case so cooling was very important, and there was just no room for a water or hybrid setup. I ultimately decided on this cooler based on recommendations from other friends of mines with compact builds, and reading some of the reviews on here.I have to say I am impressed with the overall performance, package, and features available for a sub $20 purchase. the design of the fan itself is genius. You're basically running a 120mm fan that shoves air through a cowling into the heatsink which ends in a copper contact surface with your CPU.This is way Superior to aluminum because of the conductivity properties of copper. the design of the cowling allows air to not only be compressed but also flow faster on to the CPU for a larger and faster evacuation of hot air. With the physical benefits of side, this cooler is going to be a huge compliment to even the mildest aesthetic builds.You can practically just run this fan and it adds great lighting to the interior of your case. The included controller is fantastic for choosing multitude of colors, but it also comes with connectors that allow you to connect your own RGB controllers or connect directly to your motherboard.Right now I have my graphics card connected to the motherboard, but I plan on getting a splitter so that the cooler's controller can sync the lighting between the graphics card and the fan. If you're in a situation that you cannot afford water cooling due to costs, or in my case physical space but still need superior cooling, don't hesitate any longer and go pick this up.I've seen it range between $14 and $20 on here. I have already bought two of them and it's going to continue being my premier choice for air cooling whenever I need another one.",

Hace un poquito de ruido a veces pero es much\u00edsimo menos que hac\u00eda el fan de f\u00e1brica que ten\u00eda. Y las luces RGB le dan un toque especial. Tiene 7 cambios de color, 5 niveles de brillo, 6 modos de comportamiento de RGB:1. Modo est\u00e1tico con cambio de brillo y color2. Modo estrobosc\u00f3pica con cambio de color y brillo3. Modo respiraci\u00f3n con cambio de color y reducci\u00f3n de velocidad del fan (es decir que el ritmo de luz hace parecer que el fan aumenta o disminuye las revoluciones )4. Modo arcoiris con cambio de ritmo (es decir que el RGB vaya lento o r\u00e1pido)5. Modo estrobosc\u00f3pico con cambio de color (aqui cambia el color cada vez que parpadea 3 veces) y ritmo de parpadeo (r\u00e1pido a lento)6. Respiraci\u00f3n con cambio de color y ritmo (aqu\u00ed el color cambia cada vez que se reduce el brillo de la luz y puedes cambiar el ritmo de cambio de luz)La instalaci\u00f3n fue sencilla, salvo que el bracket posterior hizo que los tornillos del fan ya no entraran en los barrenos del chasis en el gabinete y lo tuve que descartar.Sin duda es una gran opci\u00f3n si quieres reemplazar tu fan de f\u00e1brica por algo cool.
