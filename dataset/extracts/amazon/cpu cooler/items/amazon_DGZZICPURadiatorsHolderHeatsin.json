I originally bought a CPU cooler for LGA 2011 board, but was tempted to use that cooler on my LGA 775 board. It may not be as secure as a bracket with a backplate, but it holds fast and the newer CPU cooler worked fine. On the bracket itself there are markings for other CPU sockets. Just insert the clear plastic piece accordingly. Then insert the black push pin and that's it. There's notches so you can install you cooler in more than one angle. If you're wanting to upgrade an older system this bracket will open up some additional cooling options. My core 2 quad is cooler now with the separate purchase of a newer cooling unit and fresh thermal grease. Yes, I'm still using a Core 2 Quad as the heart of my main PC. Why? It works. I'm not gaming to much. I can run Windows 10, watch netflix, & more. And it's all pretty snappy too thanks to a few choice upgrades.",
