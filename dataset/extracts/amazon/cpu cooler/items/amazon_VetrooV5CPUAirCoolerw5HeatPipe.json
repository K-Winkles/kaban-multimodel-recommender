                "reviewText": "Keeps my R9 5900X at ~33\u00b0 C while idle, ~59\u00b0 C max during a stress test on all threads at default clock speeds for several minutes, but as high as ~85\u00b0 C while doing an overclocked stress test (I don't run it this way, just wanted to see how it would do).The included ARGB fan sync'd up with my existing Aura Sync setup automatically, and the fan attached easily to the heatsink... once I figured out how I was supposed to do it. The instructions were lacking a bit but the Amazon product picture helped figure it out. That and the cooler was difficult to mount to the motherboard but I feel like that's pretty standard. Even the stock cooler on my older R5 3600 was a pain to mount.Either way a great value for the money that performs well and looks good. It's a good value at full price and even better if you can find it on sale as I did. Wouldn't recommend it if you're planning on overclocking or have a processor with a higher TDP, and you'll likely get higher boost speeds with something else but I'm happy with what I paid and how it turned out.",

As i said nothing crazy, it\u2019s a good little workhorse machine and plays most of the stuff I enjoy great with no real issues. I had a Wraith cooler before and it was awful at keeping temps down and was fairly noisy. This new cooler looks good, and keeps me in the 50\u00b0 range under normal gaming stresses. Real hardcore stuff will push me into the mid to high 60\u2019s. The fans pretty quiet under load as well, so it\u2019s a serious win for the price.

                "reviewText": "This cooler is an amazing value, it does its job and cools the CPU quite well (Make sure that you read the instructions on bracket placement and TIGHTEN THE SCREWS). At first, the CPU was overheating but it was because you really have to tighten the screws, be careful with the motherboard though. After some tinkering since it was my first cooler install, I got it to work perfectly, I am very satisfied!PROS:- Comes with brackets and instructions for both Intel and AMD (Make sure you read them carefully).- It is VERY EFFECTIVE so you might be able to turn the speed down to make it quieter.- The RGBs look great and are very bright. I was able to control them with the motherboard app.- Plenty of space for RAM.CONS:- Read the instructions carefully, the bracket installation is not so straightforward (AMD).- It can be difficult to tighten as the screws are close to the cooler frame.- You really have to tighten the cooler a lot in order to make contact with the CPU (be careful with the motherboard).- Mounting or dismounting the fan is extremely difficult (I used a screwdriver to wedge it out). At least it is secure.",

                "reviewText": "Specs:AMD Ryzen 5600XAorus B550 Elite AX V2G.Skill Trident Z 2x8GB 3200MHz (black and white)EVGA 1070 FTW3housed in a:Corsair 4000D/4000D Airflow case (I have both front panels).So I've found this cooler through JayzTwoCents. You know, the guy who nearly convinced me to upgrade to watercooling... but I digress (hah). I've had this for a few weeks now but never wrote a review... so here are my thoughts:Pros:- Surprisingly good cooling! I was blown away by how good this little guy is (check screenshots). Idle temps are very much under control: low 30s all day. Even lower if you can get by the noisy fan (more on that later). Load temps never seem to cross 70s. I ran Cinabench R20 and maxed out at around 65.5 C. I do have plenty of airflow as I mentioned with my case, so your mileage way vary.- Despite there the small gap between the heat pipes on the base plate, it doesn't seem to affect the heat transfer at all. The part of heat pipes touching the IHS is actually nicely polished. It doesn't feel cheap or like they've machined it flat and left it rough. Point is, heat transfer is absolutely a non issue and there is almost zero compromises here.- I don't know if this is a ceracoat, or if it's actually painted, but either way, there doesn't seem to be any paint isolation. if you're worried its color being black, don't. I have noticed when installing it that the heatsink chipped a little (check the photos) so it may be in fact painted. Either way, temps don't leave me worried too much about it.- RAM clearance is absolutely NOT an issue. I'm not using the closest slot to the CPU, but I definitely could. Even if you orient the fan downwards, there is a cutout in the heatsink to allow you to clear your DIMMs, but I wouldn't do that as your fan won't get adequate air with the GPU in the way.- The ARGB fan is pretty nice and feels high quality. The ARGB cable a daisy-chain in case you wanna connect another ARGB thing to it. It doesn't hog your only ARGB header, so that's nice.- They include a second set of fan clips in case you wanna install a 120mm pull fan, but that's obviously an extra cost and I'm not sure how many people would do that. You're better off with a bigger heatsink at that point.Cons:- Speaking of installation, this was easy to install. The mounts are already pre-essembled, and you're using the stock AMD backplate. However, and I know that this can help prevent people from overtightening the screws, the mounts have springs, similar to stock AMD coolers. It made installing a bit frustrating as I had to apply more force than I felt necessary to tighten the screws. It also didn't help that the heatsink was in the way somewhat and I could barely get to the screws exactly perpendicular. The irony is that those screws are supposed to stop you from overtightening the cooler, but I still felt like I did. I didn't, so that's obviously good.- Noise. Oh the noise. So, with some fan curve adjustments, you can get this thing to be bearable. But stock out of the box, this thing is loud. It can go up to 1500rpm, and it really does wanna work at the higher RPMs. But don't do let it. First off the cooling is perfectly adequate at half around 700-900rpm, as you can see from my temps in the screenshots. The 65C temp I got is from Cinabench so that's pretty much the worst case scenario for most people. Realistically, you'll get around mid 50s in a game. I tried to adjust the fan curves just to see what kind of cooling I would get, and the temps barely fell. The fan is a hydraulic bearing type, so there is a fluid inside and it's the one most commonly used at this price bracket. So my recommendation is to go into your BIOS and tune the fan curve to something more bearable. Granted my 4000D isn't the quietest case, but it's definitely a noticeable thing, at least for me. Anything above 900rpm starts to sound like a rattling mess. It sounds broken almost, and it's one of the reasons why I'm gonna switch it out soon.- 150 TDP. That's fine for most CPUs, especially AMD's Ryzen, but a lot of Intel users might wanna look elsewhere.The bottom line is that this an AMAZING cooler for the money. Don't even consider the Hyper 212 from CoolerMaster with this on the market, it's just better. It's got very good heat dissipation, it has 5 heatpipes that feel more than adequate for most people, the included fan feels pretty high quality, the colors are vibrat and it's ARGB, it's black and I even wouldn't mind the loudness if it was a good sound signature. But if you care about acoustics like me, look elsewhere. Yes that's a dealbreaker to me. But if you just want something that'll keep your CPU cool, you're on a budget, and won't do any crazy overclocking, then this is a bargain. Go right ahead! For me, I'll be going back to be quiet.",

                "reviewText": "The cooler is spectacular for the cost. Easily equivalent or maybe just a bit lower in capability than say my Noctua NH-U12S on my Ryzen 9 5900X. MUCH better than the stock cooler that came bundled with my Kids Ryzen 5 5600G. If you are good at installation, and do a good job of applying decent thermal paste, expect idle around 35-37 Deg C, and full load temps at around 65-75 Deg C.Please note however, only 3 out of 5 stars, as I ordered (and Amazon confirmed as such) the BLACK version. what arrived was a NEW, WHITE version box, with a UPC printed paper with the words \"Black\" on it, covering the original UPC code, taped on with packing tape. Upon opening, sure enough, it was the white version, NOT the black as ordered. As my kids and I didn't want to postpone their computer build yet another two plus weeks, we decided to keep it as it can't be seen anyway.All parts were there in the new box, so no issues, works great, etc.. just not the colour as ordered. I would not hesitate to recommend this cooler if you are short on cash and want a high performing cooler. Cheers !Revised to five stars 2022-03-29 - Vetroo contacted me and apologized for the mix up and were willing to refund 30% of the cost to make up for the shipping / warehousing error. I declined, as I felt I already paid a fair price and the colour was honestly not important. What was important was that Vetroo were willing to help out and make it right in some manner, and that the cooler really is that good. So I can't recommend it enough!",
