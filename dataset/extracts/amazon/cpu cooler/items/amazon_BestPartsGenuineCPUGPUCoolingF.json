I have no complaints with the product, but you should definitely take note of the model numbers for your fans before ordering.You can see that the listing advertises 4 model numbers, and you will get 2 fans.My laptop (when it was new) came with fans N366 (CPU) and N371 (GPU).The fans I received were N402 (CPU) and N371 (GPU).Initially I reached out to the buyer and got a quick response from them. I was told they didn't have any N366 CPU fans, which is what I needed. This was disappointing but I did some research online.This isn't something that is advertised on any of the listing for these fans but there are multiple model numbers that will work for a repair. I compared the N402 fan I got with my stock N366 fan and the parts matched one-to-one and I had no issue installing them into my PC.Simply put, after verifying this with a few other parts websites:N366 = N402N371 = N403I've attached my photos comparing the two CPU fans next to the two GPU fans I got.",
