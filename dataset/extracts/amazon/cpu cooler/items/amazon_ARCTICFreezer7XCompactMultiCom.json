It benefits from an improved heatsink design and a reworked heat pipe layout. In conjunction with the fan, which is optimised for high static pressure, ARCTIC was been able to significantly improve the Freezer 7 X's cooling performance. P-fan for Increased Performance Inspired by the P-series, the Freezer 7 X fan benefits from all of the advantages of P-fans: * High static pressure for increased cooling performance * Broad RPM range * Lower power consumption * Less vibration * PWM for synchronous fan control Longer lifespan thanks to its low coil temperature The Freezer 7 X uses a fan motor newly developed by ARCTIC. This runs less audibly and more efficiently, so that the temperature of the coils is 20 \u00b0C lower than with conventional motors. This increases the lifespan of the fans considerably. Offset heat pipes enable optimal heat dissipation The direct touch heat pipes attached to the Freezer 7 X and an optimised design of the 44 cooling fins together ensure that the heat from the CPU can be ideally removed and released into the air.",

                "reviewText": "This cooler improved my temperatures across the board. 10 degrees cooler at idle and 18 degrees cooler under load using Prime95 benchmark testing. I was testing it against a stock Intel cpu cooler that comes with the processoer.The mounting system is very easy to figure out but slightly difficult to install IF your motherboard is already in the case. I had to pull the mobo out to get it installed properly. You might be able to get it installed easily if you have a big case. My case is medium sized and I did not have enough clearance to reach one of the screws on one side.When under full load the stock cooler was very noticeable in sound. I don't hear anything now when the CPU is under load. The large fan is quiet and has maxed out at 1,400 rpm.Great purchase. Very affordable, well built for the money and it gets the job done. First time using an Arctic product but I'll be looking to them in the future now.",

                "reviewText": "For the last 6 years, ever since I built my first computer. I made the mistake of purchasing an INTEL fan instead of AMD fan for my computer, so it didn't fit and forced me to use the stock fan that came with the AMD 8350-black edition. FOR 6 YEARS, I used that fan and assumed that the JET level noise that came from it was a normal thing.The reason why I didn't get a new CPU fan for such a long time, was because I spent 8 HOURS, trying to get the stupid Intel Fan to fit an AMD motherboard. I felt so stupid when I finally decided to double check the box and figured out the problem, that I just decided to leave it be and just be thankful I had a working computer.AND God help you, if you were playing an intense game like FF15, because that fan would be so loud...but I got use to it over time and learned to ignore it with headphones. But I finally decided nearly a month ago to try and purchase a new fan, since some of my compotents were getting on in the years and I wanted to add some new thermal paste to my CPU to keep it running optimal.Well, lo' and behold, I put this 7x Artic Freezer fan in my CPU and I freaked out for a second, thinking I didn't install it right, because I couldn't hear anything from it. But after 10 minutes of leaving my computer on and checking the fan, nothing was wrong... the fan was working, it was just quiet as HELL compared to the stock fan I'd been using for so many years.So yeah...this fan is amazing, and I'm upset with myself for not purchasing this sooner. I really am an idiot.",

                "reviewText": "The good: the cooler does work and operates quietly.The bad: first, the cooler doesn't fully cover an AM3+ CPU. More importantly however is how difficult this ended up being to mount. The brackets rotate freely as you try to hook them into place over the AMD cooler brackets (maybe Intel folks will have a better time). Once you do finally get them to line up and snap on, you're now left to manually screw the brackets down to bring the cooler to a firm contact with the CPU. Other manufacturers typically use a lever mechanism for this instead. If your case doesn't have much clearance up top, you'll soon find you cannot reach any type of screwdriver whatsoever - even the thin ones - into the case to be able to tighten the top screw down. This, coupled with the fact that the cooler fins aren't even mounted evenly above the retention mechanism made it so that the screw needed to be screwed in at an angle. I had to take the cooler back out, re-apply new thermal paste since the now-used thermal pad would have been inadequate to re-mount, fully tightly the top bracket since it couldn't be screwed on when installed, and push-and-pray as I hooked these tightened retention brackets onto the board. Should have been a 10 minute install, took an hour. The cooler is on now and operates fine, but if I ever need to remove it again, its going right into the garbage.",

This budget option seemed to fit the bill when I was searching for a replacement. It was fairly simple to install and is very sturdy. After installing, the first thing I noticed is how quiet it is. Bonus is it keeps my CPU much cooler than stock cooler! My temps during gaming went from ~65C down to ~50C.",

My old coolermaster 212 would not mount, so took to pcpartsbuilder Canada to find an affordable remedy. The Arctic 7 x got really good reviews, and the price was right. Knowing my case has always produced good thermals, and the 5600g isn't a super high voltage cpu, it was worth trying. It comes all ready to mount to an am4 board, with pre-applied thermal paste, so installation was really quick and easy. It keeps my cpu under 60c while gaming, and never gets loud enough to stand out from my case fans. Now I wouldn't be pairing this up to a top end cpu, but why would someone who can afford one of those, skimp out on its' cooler?For the money, this little cooler is tough to beat, easy to install, better than oem coolers, and looks pretty good while doing it. I'd definitely recommend!",
