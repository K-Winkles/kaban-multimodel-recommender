                "reviewText": "It may not be a fancy braided cable extension, however it does the job just fine. I needed one of these because my mother's PC case just barely fits an ATX board even though it is advertised as an ATX mid-tower case. Since the ATX board covered some of the cable-routing holes, I had to get a bit creative with cable management. The EPS cable on the PSU was not long enough to reach the motherboard's connector once I did my routing. This did the job perfectly.",
