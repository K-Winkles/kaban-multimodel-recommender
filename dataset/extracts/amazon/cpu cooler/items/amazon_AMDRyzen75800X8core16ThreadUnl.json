                "reviewText": "so, i was one of the (statistically few) who hit the silicon lottery and struck dirt. basically, my 5800x was defective. this is just a PSA, if you encounter BSODs/crashes to reboot/fatal hardware errors after installing your new CPU, it is likely defective. i was getting WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR at random times, event IDs WHEA-18 and 46. no combination of the CPU with a new motherboard, different ram, 1 stick of ram, XMP profiles off, PBO disabled, bios updates, windows reinstalls, chipset driver updates, or other device driver updates resolved the issue for me. it would occur under any load at any temperature. it's also worth mentioning that it worked fine for about 5 days before issues started to happen. if your PC is producing errors you simply cannot resolve and it started with the new CPU, please return it ASAP!! i have ordered a new one already and shipped the defective unit back. i used my old ryzen 2600 to isolate the 5800x as the issue, and my system runs completely stable as long as i keep it on. i'm sad it was defective, but ultimately, i'm not going to let it damage my opinion of the CPU, as defective products are guaranteed to slip through here and there, and amazon is extremely good about their return policy in my experience.anyway, with that out of the way, let's talk about the CPU itself. when mine was functioning normally, it was awesome. coming from an old ryzen 5 2600, the performance gain of the 5800x is a night and day difference. it's 3 years old now, but its price and still-relevant performance make it an immensely good value. it squeezed new fps gains out of my gtx 1080, and was far more than enough for my new rtx 4070. the gains in performance are even more obvious now that i'm back on the 2600 while i wait for my replacement to arrive. it was as easy to install as any other AM3/AM4 CPU. i will give a heads up however that it does run hot and is known to do so. however, AMD has explicitly stated that even 90\u00b0C is safe at full load. a high quality air cooler will be enough if you don't plan on doing serious overclocking, like me. a thermalright peerless assassin or scythe fuma should be more than enough for stock clocks with PBO left on auto. i paired this with 32gb of gskill ripjaws V with 3600mhz XMP profile, and the two paired wonderfully. the motherboard i ended up with is an MSI MAG B550 tomahawk max wifi, but the CPU will work just fine on most B450/X470 motherboards as long as your bios is up to date!!!! please do not let my disclaimer dissuade you from buying this amazing CPU, it can happen to anyone who buys any CPU, from Intel too! i can't wait for my replacement to arrive and complete my system, i wholeheartedly recommend this CPU for great performance per dollar.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing CPU for Gaming!",
                "reviewText": "I have had this CPU for around exactly one year now. Normally I do all my tech reviews fairly early but I wanted to really use this chip, overclock it, game, and do lighting editing as well. To start off my full system is a Ryzen 5800X, Asus X570-Pro board, 32GB of 3600mhz G.Skill CL16 memory (4x8GB), EVGA G3 Supernova 850 watt 80+ Gold PSU, EVGA RTX 2070 Super GPU, Cooler Master NR600 Case, Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black Edition CPU cooler. I have two Gen 4 NVMe drives and 4 normal sata SSD drives. My case is filled with all Cooler Master Masterpro ARGB high CFM airflow fans. I\u2019m also using an internal wireless card as well as my particular x570 board doesn\u2019t come with onboard WiFi. My reason for stating all this is the airflow and cooling in my case is exceptional. I have one of the highest airflow cases, with some of the best fans, one of the best CPU coolers, and I\u2019m using Thermal Grizzly Kryonaunt paste which is hands down the best CPU test for overclocking and temps in general imo. Stating all this because YOUR temps may be different than mine as well as your results. To start of with the chip I\u2019ve not had ONE single issue with it so far after a year of use. ALL I have done to it after installing it in place of the Ryzen 3600 that it replaced was I enabled DOCP on my memory which is AMDs version of XMP and I enabled PBO on my chip with the max limit set at 200mhz. That it all I touched. This chip boosts to 5.1ghz when using 2-3 cores or less easily and even if under full load will still stay around 4.75ghz on all 8 cores at 100% load. In a more realistic load like gaming it runs around 4.75-4.95ghz. Under full load like Prime95 my temps top out around 74C. Idle is around low 30s and while gaming it bounces around 55-65C. It runs super fast and super cool. This is all on air cooling too. When going from the 3600 to the 5800X while every single other aspect of my system remained the same I gained anywhere from 10 fps to over 20 fps on some games. I play at 1440P as well. If you play at 1080P your results will be even better. This is the best chip I\u2019ve ever used and owned. My RTX 2070 Super is overclocked 1100mhz on the memory and 140mhz on the core. On benchmarks my scores beat all stock and even factory OC 2080 Supers. They also beat almost all RTX 3060 ti results as well. I\u2019ve never played a single game where this chip bottlenecks my card ever. Whereas with the 3600 it did from time to time. Especially in games using DLSS which renders the game at a much lower resolution then upscales it. That makes the game way more CPU demanding and in titles with DLSS my fps increase was huge. Absolutely amazing cpu for gaming and you don\u2019t have to do anything other than enable PBO. Gone are the days of manual overclocking to get all the performance you paid for. The chips auto boost themselfs as high as they can go basically all by themselves now. If you have any Zen + or Zen 2 chip and wanna upgrade to Zen 3 aka Ryzen 5000 I say it\u2019s well worth it for gaming. The IPC increase on Ryzen 5000 over 3000 series is huge. Over 30% faster. I\u2019ve included pictures of my setup, CPUz info, benchmark results, MSI Afterburner temperature info after playing Witcher 3 at 1440P on Ultra settings for hours, and many other others. The chip boosts high, runs cool, requires basically no knowledge to get max performance from it outside of TWO toggles in the bios, and at its current price is an amazing value imo. Fast enough to pair any GPU on the market with it if you can find one. I\u2019ve been wanting a 3080 forever now but just no luck. I paid the MSRP of 450 for this chip and don\u2019t regret it at all. No crashes, no issues ever, never breaks 70C while daily use/gaming no matter how long, boosts over 5ghz, and has enough cores/threads if you wanna stream and multitask while gaming you\u2019re good to go. I think AMD did an amazing job with Zen 3 and if you\u2019re interested in the 5800X for gaming/streaming you won\u2019t go wrong. Hope this review helped and if it does please leave a like. Enjoy the pics and thanks for reading.",

It is good now that prices have come down and they go on sale quite often. A 5800X3D would be a way better upgrade if you own a 3000 series cpu or older if you have an extra $130 to spend over the 5800X which will give you better gaming performance at the cost of lower clock speeds and even more heat.It is a great cpu but does produce a bit of heat than can be lowered with some undervolting!",

                "reviewText": "Upgraded from the 2600x to this monster of a cpu. It\u2019s not quite as fast as the 5800x3d but the difference between the two in most AAA game titles is negligible. I got this for a good amount less than the 3d and coupled it with the Sapphire 7800 xt. All of my games are 100+fps or higher. It\u2019s the perfect budget cpu and frankly most titles favor Ryzen these days. Nvidia has become delusional. Thank you AMD!*note-it does run hot under load. Around 90 degrees Celsius but this is normal for this CPU (anccording to AMD themselves) and won\u2019t cause any harm. However, if you have a cheap motherboard I\u2019d recommend a water cooler. I got one (ID aio) for around $80 and this dropped the temperature to around 75 under load.",
