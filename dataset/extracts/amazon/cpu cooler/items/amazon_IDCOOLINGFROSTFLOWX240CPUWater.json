                "reviewText": "Cooler was pretty easy to install. My motherboard has some big heatsinks, and I needed to squeeze the radiator in the case. It's quiet under 75% load. Once it hits 80/85% and up on the fans, you'll definitely hear it. On the upside, my Ryzen 5 7600x never goes past 86C (and that is stock. No Curve Optimizer, undervolting or anything).There's no real RGB lighting or anything, but the logo on the pump/sink lights up a sort of off-white. It looks good.Packaging was really nice, the radiator and fins were nice and straight and not bent. The fans, themselves are pretty nice. They don't look or feel cheap. I removed the SATA power adapter, the pump runs fine off the motherboard connector.If you look at this radiator and compare it to, say an Arctic, the Arctic radiator is noticeably thicker. It's something to consider, but for the price I paid and for the performance i'm receiving, i'm not complaining at all.EDIT (After a few months) I had to replace the fan y-splitter cable. I coiled it pretty tight and probably damaged it, one fan would spin up to 100% but the reported rpm would be low and the other fan would spin at the lower rpm. I think the splitter cable is fragile/stiff, and honestly I did some weird tricks to hide the cable in my case. Very good value cooler, and i'd buy ID Cooling products in the future.",

Well, it turned out to be too noisy when you were in the room and it was putting out so much heat.i wanted a cheap water cooler and I replaced it with this. It seems to run great and was relatively easy to install (I have a small case which is not the fault of the product.) It\u2019s quiet and the temps have been low. My only complaint is the LED on the pump. i wish there was some way I could disable it as my case is clear on one side.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first AIO water cooler and it was very easy to install. It was cheaper than some heartsick/fans so why not. Works well and takes up considerably less space than my heat sink/fan combo I had. At first, I installed only 2 fans and my CPU (i7 12700) would reach 40-45 at idol. I didn\u2019t want to up the fan speeds because I would start to hear them. So I put 2 more fans and sandwich the radiator between 4 fans. Now the temp at idol hovers around 37-40. Fans rpm less than 1000. I don\u2019t OC or play any games that would max the CPU so I think this will be adequate. I stress tested the CPU with CPU-Z and it would max out at around 80. From what I\u2019ve read in other reviews, the included thermal paste is terrible (understandable for the price) so I used my own Arctic Silver mx-4. Might as well just not include it since people will need to do it twice\u2026Some people reported loud noises at start up but mine is totally quiet. Virtually zero noise at startup. Guess I don\u2019t have air in mines? Some people reported problems with the screws but mine didn\u2019t have that problem either. They give you only 8 long screws so I had to get myself 8 more to do the 4 fan sandwich. Go to Home Depot and get #6-32 1-1/4 inches if you want to do the same. They fit perfectly. I also got some #6 washers just in case they went too deep and hit the radiator. I don\u2019t know if it would though without the washers.In any case, if you\u2019re serious about OC or always max out your CPU with games, video renders or whatever, you might want to invest in a branded cooler. But this is perfectly fine for everyday computing and gaming. Gaming mostly uses the GPU anyway and rarely maxes out the CPU. Let\u2019s just hope it doesn\u2019t start leaking in a few years.",

                "reviewText": "I was one of those \"frequent returns\"-- this cooler came with 3 of the 4 standoffs needed for the LGA 1700 install. Amazon shipped out a new one, I swiped the standoffs I needed and sent back the replacement, which I told them about.Once installed, the cooler was GREAT. Dropped temps in my case significantly, not just for the CPU, but for the graphics card as well, because it opened up airflow a lot compared to the bulky air cooler I'd tried first. I'm running a 13600kf, not the hottest card, but it can get pretty toasty on an air cooler. In NMS, it runs in the mid-40s, for example, with the water cooler. With the air cooler I was hitting TJ max in Cinebench, and the water cooler took me at least 15 degrees cooler than that.So be prepared for a little tomfoolery in the way of attention to detail, but once you get all the parts you need, this works great.",

Very easy to install and extremely quiet and effective in operation. No RGB, but I didn't need it in this computer, no monitor on the pump (I didn't need it either). However, they operate very quietly and keep the processor temperature low. AIO is not big. Only 280mm but very good. I use it to cool the Intel i7 12700K processor. I play a lot on this computer and I am very pleased with the quality and performance of this AIO. I highly recommend. You won't spend much money, and competing companies demand a lot of money for their AIOs. Why overpay?",
