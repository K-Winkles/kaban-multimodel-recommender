                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Dual tower cooler with ARGB accents",
                "reviewText": "Let\u2019s be honest, you\u2019re probably buying this for the ARGB lights. It\u2019s very showy, and looks good if you\u2019re into that kind of thing. It\u2019s a decent sized cooler, so it should work moderately well for most use cases as long as you\u2019re not torturing your CPU with ridiculous workloads all the time. There are cheaper coolers, there are bigger coolers, but this one is a middle ground with the use of lights, cooler size, and pricing.In terms of cooler dimensions, this cooler is fairly close in size to the Scythe Fuma 2. It has a nice ARGB plate on top of each tower with an X on each. I\u2019m not particularly fond of the X on top as I would prefer a more interesting design, but hey, more RGB is a nice addition if you\u2019re into that kind of thing. The outer fan is an ARGB fan, while the inner fan is a normal fan. The heatfins and heatpipes appear to be coated with a black enamel, which likely is thermally conductive.There are a few things worth taking into account with this cooler. First, you\u2019re going to need to bring your own screwdriver for installation. During the assembly process you\u2019re going to need to take out the middle fan and reach your screwdriver down between the towers to mount the cooler. Longer and thinner is better here. Second, the RGB and fan cables are pigtailed off of each other with non-standard connectors. If you have to replace the RGB fan, you\u2019re going to need to get another from Vetroo or have an additional cable to manage later. In the case of the fans themselves, the center fan has a short 4 pin fan cable that plugs into a port on the cable for the outer ARGB fan. The short cable means that you will have a bit of extra cable to manage if this fan ever needs to be replaced. The outer ARGB fan only has 3 wires, so all speed control is being done off the middle fan. Not a problem, just worth noting to be aware of this. When installed, the front fan hangs over your ram, completely covering it. If you\u2019re looking for a cooler that doesn\u2019t cover your ram, you may want to consider an AIO or one that bends the heatpipes to offset the tower instead.In terms of performance, this doesn\u2019t seem to be a bad cooler. It seems to be cooling the system a bit better than the older 4 and 5 heatpipe single towers I\u2019ve used previously. With that said, your mileage may vary depending on how you have your case airflow set up. It was an improvement with my case configuration, but without looking at yours it will be hard to say. It appears that performance could be improved further with a third fan, since the cooler has the fin cutouts to mount a third fan, but it doesn\u2019t come with the clips for a third one. If you want to use a third fan you will need to source another set of mounting clips elsewhere. I didn\u2019t attempt to test with a third fan, so take this with a grain of salt.The included instruction manual isn\u2019t amazing, but it should be good enough to help you install the cooler with minimal issues.One final thing worth noting is that there are two revisions of this product out there. The first revision was released last spring, and had some mounting issues if the brackets weren\u2019t perfectly aligned. I previously purchased one of these and had to get a refund since it was fairly difficult to mount. The cooler listing was removed, and a new listing was put up once the issue was corrected. It seems to have now been fixed, as the springs on the mounting screws can move more freely to self align the cooler without the mounting brackets being perfectly aligned. This was not the case on the initial cooler, since the springs were fairly rigid and required moderate precision to get everything to line up properly. At the time of writing this review I can see one unverified review mentioning issues like this, and I can only assume that that reviewer purchased his in the first batch. Just a grain of salt to consider when reading reviews.",

It is out-performing my Cooler Master Hyper 212 which costs more and is working with less powerful CPUS.If you buy this CPU cooler ignore the instructions given on the youtube video for the AMD cpus. You no longer need to take out the back plate for AMD cpus for installation (and in the AM5 platform you no longer can anyways). Just follow the instructions included with the cooler. The only draw back is that I did not find the images clear enough and telling appart the screws to be used was a bit confusing at first.I think I will buy a second one of these and keep it for future builds.",

                "reviewText": "So many of the reviews about CPU temps had me freaked out about Ryzen 7 5800x temps. I had an issue with a previous different dual cooler I ordered and had to return. So anyways, this thing was a breeze to install. The RGB lighting is amazing, I'm using RGB Fusion 2.0 (Gigabyte software) and it's truly amazing eye candy. Most importantly is that it's keeping everything cool (like it should) and it's quiet. The noise level is exceptionally low.In terms of thermals, some people own PC cases which are literal coffins of thermal death. I have two 160mm Fans on the front for Air intake. One 160 mm fan at the back to push air out the back. The top of the case I setup two 160mm fans in an Air Circulation configuration. One taking in air and the other is pushing air out. Most importantly the one pushing air into the case is pushing air to FRONT Fan on the Vetroo U6PRO cooler and the other fan is pulling air out of the case from the Rear of the Vetroo U6PRO cooler. I decided to experiment with an Air Circulation flow configuration.It's important to keep enough steady air flow through things, which keeps fan speeds down lower, without the fans having to ramp up and make more noise and struggle.Anyways, this dual Tower Cooler works and does it job. If you are running with Air cooling system, just make certain your case has good air flow and is properly setup for it.I'd buy this cooler again. All the important features are there and this was not a disappointment for me to buy and be using.Take care and have a great day.",

Its a big-boy dual tower, my ram does fit under the fan without bumping it up. But taller ram would force the fan to be pushed up. I will update after I do some testing, and run this new build.Oh and I got another $15 off regular price with an amazon coupon check box.

(from 70-80\u00b0c to 50-60\u00b0c)The installation was a little tedious because in order to screw in the screws, you have to remove the fan in the way by pulling out the little metal things that hold the fan to the heat sinks, screwing it in, and putting the metal things back in.The PWM works perfectly along with the ARGB sync with my ASUS motherboard as well",
