                "reviewText": "Don't let some other reviews fool you about these being unsafe. It seems that there are some people reviewing these that understand how to use a multi-meter, but don't really understand how GPU's are powered. Yes, all of the ground pins are common as are the three 12v pins. This is NOT dangerous, and it is NOT a short as these people are implying. It seems they decided to use a single ground plane and a single 12v plane on the circuit board. The GPU only uses 12v and ground. As long as you're getting the proper signal on the proper pins, which all five that I've bought do, you're perfectly fine. If you were finding the ground and 12v bridged... that would be a short, and would be absolutely dangerous. Not a single one of these that I've bought have had a short. You can ignore the reviews saying these are unsafe because the grounds are all common as well as the 12v, and that's perfectly safe for this applications. These people simply do not understand what they're talking about.As to the rest of the product. They do what they do well, they're constructed about as well as you can expect them to be and they look quite good... much better than the majority that just put some foam on the back to protect the exposed circuit board. Above all else, they're safe to use. My one complaint is that there is no latch, which makes sense if the latch is on the inside of the connector as it would be very hard to reach. However, once connected, the connection is pretty snug and they don't back out easily.I'm using a different set on a 3070 Ti and they've been working great. I was using this set on a 3080 Ti, but opted to go with the Thermal Grizzly WireView. Not for any shortcomings of this product, but the way I have the GPU setup and my custom cables, it was pulling on these in a way I didn't like and the WireView is a single block making it more ridged for this application. It's also nice that it can display how much wattage and current the GPU is currently consuming in real time. However, it is quite a bit more expensive.If you need a 180\u00b0 adapter and you don't want to spend a lot, but you want it to look nice, these are a must. Just be sure that the orientation is correct for your GPU. A lot of people are giving these bad reviews because they didn't read and bought the wrong kit. If you're willing to spend more and you'd like to be able to see the current power consumption, I highly recommend the Thermal Grizzly WireView.",
