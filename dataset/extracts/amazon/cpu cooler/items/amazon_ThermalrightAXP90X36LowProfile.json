Tips to install in narrow space, such as in ASRock X300M - adjust fan position gently to leave 2 - 3 mm gap to RAM or other motherboard components.",

Was hoping this would be enough cooling to avoid throttling but sadly it isn't. It cools roughly the same but does so with slightly lower fan noise. It may do better in a case with better air flow.",

                "reviewText": "My AIO is dead and buy this for backup / replacement until it returns from RMA.CPU is 13900kf, this cooler can handle the heat for non CPU intensive workload. ~50C at idle. For some games, could reach 100C. Just like what it advertises, near 95w TPD, more than that is going to hit the temperature wall. Anyway, this is not designed for high end CPU.The build quality of this product is good. Low profile, okay for itx complex case. I would still recommend Noctua's low profile cooler. However, this one is much cheaper, suitable for low budget build. I would recommend this for i3 CPU. For AMD 5000 series, ryzen 3. You don't need this if go for AMD 3000series, the cooler comes with the processor is much better than this.The pre-installed nuts and screws are too tight, takes me a while to release them with a plier. Installation is easy if you can have access to the back of the motherboard. Just install the cooler before mounting the motherboard to the case.",

On my Ryzen 5 4600G, at idle, it won't cool to below 88 C. At performance fan mode, It got to 80 C. The fit and finish of the heatsink is good, but it doesn't have the build quality to transfer heat effectively.",
