I was doing an upgrade from a Ryzen R3 2200GE to this R3 4100 and adding a discrete GPU. Well after installing the 4100 I got nothing. After checking Asus site I found that, Opps, I needed to upgrade the bios. No biggie I thought, I'll just put the 2200GE back in and flash the mobo to the latest bios. Well the drama started there the previously working flawlessly ASUS PRIME A320M-K with the Ryzen R3 2200GE no longer posted at all. Curious but no worries I had a newer Asus PRIME B450M-A/CSM I had retired when I upgraded my personal computer to a R7 3700X in a Asus Tuf Gaming x570-plus board a couple of years back. I was saving the 450 to move the 3700X to when I upgrade my current CPU to a R7 5800. I knew the current bios accepts the 4100 as I checked the ASU support page for the board. Easy Peasey I installed the CPU and plugged everything in and nothing. I plugged in a R3 3200, nothing. I changed out the PSU, nothing. I removed the ram and installed a different kit, nothing. Mind you I tried this on both motherboards and on both the CPU fan would spin up and the stop. The only thing that happened to both previously working boards was the R3 4100. So maybe it's just bad luck and I rolled snake eyes with this one. I sent the CPU back and told Amazon what happened I hope it gets sent back to AMD to be checked out before it's sent on to someone else. Still love me some Ryzen though and this was an excuse to buy some more up to date equipment for my secondary back up build. Perhaps I'll just get a higher end Ryzen Based Mini PC.12-11-2023 I bought a AceMagician R7 5700U mini PC on a flash sale here on Amazon for $254.00. It meets my needs for a back up system by a good deal. I will wait for the Ryzen 8000 series CPU to retire my R7 3700X system altogether. I'll start saving up for it now as I am sure it'll be somewhat costly.",
