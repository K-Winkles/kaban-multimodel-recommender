                "reviewText": "Got a tight fit? Trying to make a radiator fit but your EPS cables are too bulky? These may be your solution. I had a build that had me scratching my head. The case being used had promotional materials which literally shows a 360 radiator mounted to the top of the case. What I didn\u2019t notice was that all promotional images showed either an unconventional motherboard, a mobo missing EPS cables or one using flat cables. Well crap. I tried multiple solutions from 90 degree adapters to custom cables. The problem was either the plug would hit the radiator or the cable gauge was too large to be malleable. Well, I finally found these and they worked like a charm. Malleable cable and a standard plug and not to long to be inconvenient to manage with a standard mid tower case when paired with your included PSU cables. Highly recommend for any builder inconvenienced by cases not taking into account EPS locations on modern motherboards and cable sizes from PSUs.",

My new one is this onehttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q8VJ17J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1As I'm reusing all my old hardware I have somewhat limited options for cable routing and component placement. While running my power cables I came up short on the CPU power cable, like two inches short. As I didn't want to absolutely strain the wires to connect I looked up this extension, bought it, and had it installed in very short order. With newer cases there's usually room behind the motherboard tray for cable management and that's where the excess length of this cable was stashed. This came as a two pack and since I love the new case I'll have need of the other extension when I build my next one.",
