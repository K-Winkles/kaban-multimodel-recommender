So there are two designs this guys sell and randomly ship. According to listing it\u2019s just art changes but the one I got says is lga 1700 and I gotta I am very impressed with build quality. There are more expensive options out there and I did try them but guess what, it\u2019s the exact same thing don\u2019t waste your money. This product is good enough as is. CPU temps seems to get in control and well and best thing is my cpu will not have bending issue long term so I am happy that my 600 dollar cpu will not get damaged long term. Good luck gamers and get this product instead of that other expensive option. It\u2019s just the name up charge no quality difference.",

                "reviewText": "I never liked the original hold-down. It's easy to use, but I'm an engineer and I just don't like the way the standard hardware fits. I also had one core always a little warm. I wouldn't have changed anything, but I wanted to replace the slightly noisy RGB fans on my 360mm AIO cooler with BeQuiet 3s, so since I was going to be dragging the cooler out I decided to install this too. No problems removing the old one, and just a tiny bit of extra care needed in fitting this. It is very precisely the right size, so you need to be sure that it is sat down properly. At first it seemed right, but a slight shift and it dropped down the final mm and locked in place. The original screws secure it without any feeling of crushing, but when done the processor has no movement anywhere. After re-attaching the cooler the system fired right up. With the change of fans and use of a fan controller the processor is running cooler and I don't have anything getting close to throttling. This is only a minor part of the solution, but better safe than sorry. Worth the 'investment'.",
