                "reviewText": "Not sure if I needed this or if it makes any temp difference because it is in a new system with nothing to compare it to, but It was easy to install, looks good, (even though you can't see it after assembly) and there is no way the cpu is going to move. I simply installed the cpu in the factory socket, then removed the 4 screws that attach the factory mechanism and lifted it straight up and out. Then installed the new fixing frame with the provided screws and wrench. Perfect fit and easy to work with.In other reviews, someone questioned that the frame did not go all the way to the top of the CPU. That's okay, it is not supposed to. If it did, your cooler would not make adequate contact with the CPU.One note, if you are removing the plastic clamping hold downs on your motherboard to install different cooler brackets or a water block, leave them in place and install this first. It will hold the back place once you remove the plastic brackets, making life easier.So, I don't know if it helps with the AM5 socket, but it's not that expensive in the grand scheme and is a quality part. Can't hurt and I like it!",

                "reviewText": "Can't say too much about a simple part like this, other than it does exactly what it's designed to do. With this properly installed, there is pretty much no possible way to torque down a cooler on the CPU in a way that would create significantly more pressure on one side of the CPU compared to the other. This virtually guarantees your cooler will be seated perfectly and work as well as it possibly can (so long as you properly apply any thermal paste you might be using). This won't, in and of itself, increase cooling, but it will help ensure your cooler is mounted properly so that it can work effectively.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a little surprised by the number of reviewers claiming that installation was \"easy\" given that the backplate falls off the back of the motherboard once you remove the CPU ILM.It wasn't immediately obvious to me as to why the screws where failing to thread into the motherboard until I found a comment on one of their installation videos which pointed out that the backplate had likely fallen out onto the back of the case which required that I disassemble the entire PC, and remove the motherboard just to install this CPU frame.Performance wise It had very little if any impact on CPU temperatures.I would say that the only upside to this product is cleaner application of thermal paste especially given the design of the new AM5 processors.The build also looks a bit cleaner with the CPU frame so there's that as well although you likely won't notice if you're using a air cooler which sits on top of it.",
