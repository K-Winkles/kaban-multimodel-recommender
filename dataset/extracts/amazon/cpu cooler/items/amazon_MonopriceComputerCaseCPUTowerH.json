Attach it under your desk with the help of this computer mount so you can keep your PC tower off your desk, and still off the floor where it could get dusty or be cumbersome to reach. This mount gives your computer case a home that is secure and out of the way, but still within easy reach. It works particularly well with sit-stand desks, allowing CPU enclosures to move with your height-adjustable workstation while keeping cables and connections attached and organized. This mount features a rotating mechanism so you can easily access any side of your computer case keeping ports accessible and unobstructed. It also has a sliding feature, so you can push your CPU enclosure out of the way during normal use, or pull it in closer when you need to access it.",
