                "reviewText": "We got this for my Aunt for Christmas. This computer is a LOT of computer for the price. A top of the line i7 processor, Fast SSD drive, 16Gb of RAM and plenty of connections, it is a very high performance computer for under $999 at this point and time. The only thing it lacks is a high end graphics card for 3d gaming, which my Aunt did not need. Honestly, this was more computer than she needed, but we wanted to give her a premier experience and also wanted to keep her from having to update any time soon. She had her last computer for over 10 years, so this one should last her nearly that long as well, based on its current specs and her use-case.For anything but high-intensive graphics processing, this is pretty much as much computer as most people ever need for stuff like internet surfing, e-mail, word processing and videos and such. It\u2019s good quality, and it is working great. We paired it with a nice 27 inch Samsung monitor and it is a beast. It also comes with a mouse and a chicklet keyboard, which is up to you to keep or change. But they are perfectly functional and work fine unless you need something more.A solid five stars for what it is!",
