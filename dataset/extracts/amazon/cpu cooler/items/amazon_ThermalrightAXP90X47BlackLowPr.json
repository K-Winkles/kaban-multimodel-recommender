                "reviewText": "I bought this for a micro-atx AM4 mobo. Well made and does the job impeccably. Temperatures dropped about 10C below the previous AMD Stealth cooler. Noise is also unobtrusive.However, mounting is confusing. They give you lots of mounting hardware for both AM4 and Intel. You WILL need to replace the OEM backing plate. They provide you a new plate. So you will need access to the back of the motherboard. The manual doesn't really show the stackup of the backing plate, studs, and mounting plate for an AM4 setup. That takes a while to figure out. Also, the fan clips can be awkward to get into position.I'm usually very good at sorting out installation issues, but this one had me stumped for a little while. I finally figured it out. Once installed, it works well and I don't regret buying it.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice cooler...it is in a inwin b1 on a 5700G built around the ASRock b450 itx fatality...my main complaint with noctua similar but more popular offering is the direction it vents, it pushes air out left and right vs up and down so basically airflow is cut off by the memory and IO area ..this one from thermalright is exactly opposite it vents out the top and bottom(with convection mostly top) so this little problem as basically gone, the mounting mechanism defenetly isn't noctuas famously easy to use one but it's effective and considering I'm not going to be taking the cooler off twice a week it's fine and iv defently seen worse on soposedly high end cooling solutions so I have no complaints...if I were to pick a single thing to hone in on with this brand it's the smorgusborg for varients they offer, 36mm copper(black or gray) 43mm aluminum copper or black copper, 53mm in all versions mentioned above, all difrent weights...ya it's a bit much for your average consumer...but that being sead I was able to find 2 that I liked that would not only maximize the height in my specific case wile leaving enough of a gap to pull in air but I also had a choice of color so there is that...but I think to drive my point home here I ended up buying 2 one all black that is soposed to be coated copper and one that is just all copper becase aperently even tho they are the same under the coating they are showing in the description as difrent weight and wattage so we will see about that once I receive the secound all shiny copper heavy one lol...overall I like them they are not over engenered just to make a basic mistake like push the air in a direction that on every itx motherboard made in the last 10years has many large tall things called ram modules RIGHT there basically eliminating any benefits of your product being heavy dense and well built lol...good job thermalright you didn't forget the basics-----------Update I just received the full copper revision of this model and yes it is infact noticeably heavier...I will defently be swapping out the all black one for this one and pairing it with the noctua slim 92mm fan from a nh-l9a and probebly artic MX 4 compound and doing some before and after testings on all the difreces...I'm not realy shur why this model is heavier than the black one as the black one is soposed to be full copper aswell just painted with a thermaly conductive paint and also nickel plated but we are going to find out what the results are of the difrences after testing...I want to be clear I like the all black model and the fans on these are ok, I will not be returning whichever one I don't use for this build long term I just want to make shur I am pairing the best possible solution with this 5700G to get the best possible cooling performance so I don't have to worry about my CPU temps in this airflow anemic case that is the inwin b1...lolI will likely just copy and paist this review for the copper one so there is a bit more feedback for both models becase as of right now there is very little user feedback on these and that a shame as they both have the same benefits over the noctua LP coolers that being they blow air up and are not blocked off by the memory or IO area(cooler or integrated sheald) but all the info in this review is still relevant for the copper one especial this part lol",

                "reviewText": "Very easy and clean install with AM5 cpus and my Ryzen 5 7600x runs 40-50c while gaming at 4k. The only thing you have to be aware of is that this cooler comes with multiple different pieces of hardware for mounting different socket types and if you plan on using it for AM5 I would suggest using the longer screws with the stock backplate and not using a screwdriver with the socket tool they give you for tightening down the nuts as I heard you can risk over-torqueing them, so stick to only finger tight. I would definitely recommend this cooler over the Noctua l9a as the mounting method on that is a real pain because you have to line up the holes without a guide, which can get messy and the screws end up stripping, which is unfortunate for a product that costs double the amount this cooler does.",

                "reviewText": "Was effective in dropping my CPU temp by 20 degress Farenheit.Installation was difficult on my HP Desktop-Elite potato. The stock proprietary HP CPU cooler mount required the use of the LA115X brackets. For this computer model, follow the INTEL LGA 115X guide procedure although the CPU is an AMD. Also the mounting screws' rubber grommets were too short to make contact with the motherboard, because the processor sits high above the board on this computer. Adding a couple of neoprene washers under the grommets allowed for a snug mounting to the motherboard. The kit should come with taller or additional grommets to accomodate this circumstance. The backplate interfered with my re-seating of the motherboard. I used a dremel tool to remove the original chassis mounts that the original CPU cooler was mounted to. This worked because this kit's cooler is held in place to the motherboard by the kit's supplied backplate instead of to under-motherboard chassis mounting threads . A lot of modification was involved with replacing the original CPU cooler with this kit, but it all worked out in the end.Also, check your BIOS. It may allow you to increase the idle CPU fan speed. I set mine to 15% faster and my idle CPU temp dropped from 116F to 87F.",

                "reviewText": "So if you can only fit a 47mm cooler into your AM4 system then the full copper version is the best performing cooler I have found by far, but it does have some issues.1. It is not a cheep cooler, and for the price the build quality is not as good as the much cheaper and thinner Noctua.2. The fan is unnecessary loud, I used the Noctua fan that came with my previous cooler, which is much quieter and has no noticeable loss in performance.3. Mounting the cooler is a bit of a pain. It takes some juggling to get the mounting pressure firm enough for best cooling without bending the motherboard like a banana.However in my ultra thin micro ATX case that sits under my TV this cooler is worth about 100 points in cinnebench over the Noctua due to reduced thermal throttling.",
