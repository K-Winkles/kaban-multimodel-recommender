Installation and BIOS configuration was a BREEZE. Posted easily on Windows 11. It supports EXPO on my RAM on 1st try without issues. Note that you will need to upgrade to DDR5.Also note that this CPU does not come with a box cooler. I thought I needed a bigger cooler but the SilverStone 240 AIO I had on hand is doing a fantastic job so far on push-pull front intake. 38Cs-low 40sC at low load and max 65-70C during gaming using the integrated graphics. It can't do much but was enough for testing. I will update my review when the GPU comes in and if I need better cooling after all.I got it on sales for Black Friday. Great value, especially compared to intel prices. I only plan to use it for gaming so I can't comment on productivity.Delivery from Amazon was rapid and the box arrived in perfect condition. I have it installed on an MSI MPG B650 Edge WiFi motherboard.",

                "reviewText": "Previously, I owned and tested 13900k/8000mhz DDR5 PC builds, and honestly, why not try AMD?This CPU is insanely power-efficient and basically fights the 13700k/13900k for its performance. During gaming, you run around 50 watts, and on full load, 75, compared to 13700k or 13900k, which is around 400 or ~100-150 during gaming.The AM5 CPUs will run hot, depending on your cooling solution. They run intentionally hot up to even 100 \u00b0C, and that's literally by design due to a thick IHS. Go on Youtube and look at the first video: \"Buildzoid 7800x3D Cool\"\u2014you can literally cool this CPU with a stock heatsink and lose like 1% of the performance.Compared to the Intel series of CPUs, you cannot overclock but can use \"PBO,\" which allows you to \"curve optimize\" the CPU and gain some performance points, but honestly, you can just use it stock.DDR5 overclocking is a bit more stable depending on your board and is basically capped at 6,000 for regular users. If you take some time, with the new agesas, you can try out 7800 mt+ or 6400 and gain basically the same FPS as an intel-tuned PC.Overall, this chip is insane for gaming; it sucks a bit at productivity and does lose to the Intel platform in some scenarios (productivity/some single-core loads), but if you're a normal user, just buy some cheap 6000 ram, board, and cooling, and you will be able to upgrade to like a 3rd-gen CPU of the AM5 and stay within 15% of Intel performance without much struggle.",

Yet to find a game that is limited by CPU on any graphics quality. I was caught between this and a higher \"trim\" sans the 3D cache, but found that for almost all uses, single-core performance is more important that combined core performance. This means that the 7800X3D is better in most standard cases than a 7900x, despite being cheaper.Can't recommend more!",

So what is a gamer to do but get a new rig?My specifications called for a gen5 M2 drive and 10G Lan on-motherboard. I decided to go with team red for the CPU (7800X3D) this time, and don't regret it at all. I used my old 3090 from the prebuilt, but everything else is new, and I couldn't be happier. No driver issues, games load quickly and save scumming is good. Recommended.",

                "reviewText": "RE: AMD Ryzen 7 7800x3dThis CPU is an example of engineering at its best, not only is it the No. 1 gamer but doing so using up to 60+ % less power, the efficiency of this CPU cannot be overstated. I built a new gamer around this chip and from the first boot I could tell this is a rig to content with. The first games I loaded in were Doom Eternal and Halo Infinite, and not only did I see an uptick in FPS but a very noticeable decrease in response time. The temps were running from the high 50s to the low 60s with an occasional spike to 70 and that was pushing the game to the max. My total power used (including a 27\u201d HDR monitor) averaged 100 watts less than my previous rig while performing at a higher level. I highly recommend this CPU to anyone looking to build new or upgrade, I also recommend AMD to anyone interested in future proofing.",

                "reviewText": "If you're shopping for a gaming CPU in 2024, then you are picking the right one. As of right now, there is no better AMD CPU for gaming. This CPU reach a little better that the Ryzen 9 7900X, and 7900 X3D has not been proven to be definitely better at the moment. Both of those Ryzen 9 CPUs cost significantly more than this one. So if you are building a PC, and plan to use an AMD processor (because who wants to pay double or triple the price for comparable performance from an Intel processor), then you've chosen the right one. Instead of reading reviews on Amazon, I would recommend that you look at technical reviews and comparisons and hierarchy lists on other websites. But then come back here and purchase it.",

                "reviewText": "Cost for performance is stellar for this CPU. Runs cool, mine hardly ever goes above 75c with just an air cooler after hours of heavy gaming. If you are in need of a CPU for more than gaming though... this is not the CPU for you. For standard workstation loads this CPU falls behind a 7700x. If you want more workload performance them try for the 7950X3D. Though as I said the 7800X3D is the best for gaming. It even surpasses the 7950X3D by a bit even in gaming. So if you wondering if this is worth the jump to AM5 i'd say if you can find a decent Mother Board for a good price then yes! My PC does NOT need water cooling to keep the parts cool when gaming with this CPU! Also not to mention it does all this while only requiring 65w of power!",
