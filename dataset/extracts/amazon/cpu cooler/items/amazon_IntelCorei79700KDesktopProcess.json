                "reviewText": "I had an i7 processor and/or motherboard go bad. It still worked if you set it to a single core, but the multicore stopped working. I had way too much stuff setup on the computer and didn't want to buy a new computer and have to reinstall hundreds of applications and move all the data, so I decide to fix the existing Lenovo Legion computer.Rather than try and figure out if it was the processor or motherboard that went bad I bought a replacement motherboard from Lenovo (only place I could find it) and this i7-9700K.To my knowledge Intel no longer produces the i7-9700K processor and I needed to have this exact one since it was going into a legacy motherboard, so I had to purchase a used processor.The i7-9700K came in a plastic processor package and that was placed inside of a small, padded, mailing envelope. It arrived in great shape, no issues there.I was a little leery of it not working but I pulled out the old motherboard and processor but in the new ones and the computer started up and has been working great.The only problem that I've had, which is not the fault of this processor, is that putting in a new motherboard causes all of the authentication for Microsoft Office applications to fail. Still trying to get that resolved. Really hoping I don't have to uninstall all Office apps and reinstall. My other applications that I've run so far had no issues.The processor arrived quickly and has been running great so I'm happy.",

                "reviewText": "I upgraded from the i5 9400F. I didn\u2019t want to change my motherboard to accommodate the ene-of-the-line 10th generation intel processor. I change up every few years and I think it is more prudent to wait until the 10nm fabrication this time around.I bought the processor for gaming and VR. At first I was getting major loss in fps at 80-90 hz on a 165hz hertz monitor (HP Omen 27i IPS display, 1440 res., 165 hz). I have Noctua NH-U95 cooling it with one fan, which isn\u2019t enough. It would exceed 75C without overclocking under full load. Once I added a second fan attached to the heatsink, and one above to vent of out the warm air, it never exceeds 60C and idles at 30C!Paired with a Strix overclocked gtx 2070 and having 32gb of DDR4 memory, I can play almost any PC game at full quality and all VR games. H-K: Alyx is pretty cranked up as far as quality and it runs smoothly. The 9400F was noticeably maxing out in performance. While the 9700K is only around 12-14% faster, it is enough headroom to smooth out performance in gaming. Everything also felt snappier as far as desktop usage. It should give me enough processing power until the next advances in transistor fabrication.This processor probably doesn't overclock well with the performance hit it takes at higher temperatures. Inadequately cooled, the CPU Benchmark was 89%. Once I increased the airflow, it came in at 100%. With my 9400F, the gaming PC score was around 90%. With the 9700K, I\u2019m at 108%. Unless you\u2019re gaming, the 9400F is more than adequate for most needs.",

                "reviewText": "I'm upgrading from a 4790k. If you own something from recent generations, then upgrading may be unnecessary (depending on your disposable income). I know the allure of owning the latest and greatest, of which this is for gaming.Previous build:cpu: 4790K @4.4GHzcooler: Cooler Master GeminII S524 Version 2mobo: MIS Z97 Gaming 7gpu: Asus ROG Strix OC 1080 Timemory: Corsair Vengeance 2 x 8 DDR3 1600MHzpsu: Corsair TX750Current build:cpu: 9700K @5.1GHzcooler: CORSAIR H100i PRO RGBmobo: Asus ROG Strix Z390-Igpu: Asus ROG Strix OC 1080 Timemory: Corsair Vengeance 2 x 16 DDR4 3200MHzpsu: Corsair HX850i9700K v 9900K:For gaming, the 9700K is ~$120-150 cheaper and you only lose a few frames and in some cases gain frames. The question of whether Hyper-threading is right for you is up to your application. Gaming benefits from clock speed over core count once a minimum core count is reached. I think the was Intel's rationale in offering the 9700K. It's a budget 8 core unlocked 9th gen cpu with no Hyper-threading.The 9900K is the obvious superior choice for multi-threaded operations and encoding. If you're looking for a powerful encoding cpu for broadcasting/recording, the 9900K will be a budget buy beating out the entry X-series HEDT chips by at least half the price.If you are looking for a high performance gaming cpu, this should be on your short list. Gaming benchmarks comparing the 9700K v 9900K show negligible differences. I'll leave the AMD debate/comparisons for others.I'll let the benchmarks I've attached speak for themselves, but here is the tldr.I overclocked to 5.1Ghz using XMP I, DDR4 3200MHz. I turned off Speedstep and Speed shift as this brought me more stability when playing games, specifically LoL.Idles at ~40 degrees @1.359-1.368v. Under load ~80 degrees @1.376-1.385v.I have included benchmark screen shots (each paired with the corresponding HWMonitor results) from CineBench, CPU-Z, 3DMark Time Spy Benchmark & Stress tests. I'm extremely happy with the performance of this processor. It runs warm, but an overclocker should be prepared for advanced cooling solutions.",

I purchased this as a replacement for my Core i5 8400 CPU. According to the ASUS website this is the maximum size CPU I could install on my Asus Z370-A with the latest BIOS update for the 300 series chipset. With the addition of a new RTX 3080TI and 32gb Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro SL, this PC now performs great and removed almost all of the CPU bottleneck I had. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 now performs beautifully on ULTRA. A must for anyone not interested in replacing their Asus Intel 300 series motherboard.",

                "reviewText": "A good Cpu, and a great choice if you are upgrading on a x370 or z390 motherboard. It does not come with a stock cooler, as the stock cpu cooler is inadequate for the I7I do NOT reccomend this purely for gaming, because the processor has 8 cores and 8 threads, which is overkill for most games, you would be better off buying an i5-9600kf which has 6 cores while still being overclock-able, it has no integrated graphics but, at a lower price. You can invest thay money into something else, like a better graphics card or more SSD storage. make sure your system's performance is well balanced, won't be ideal to pair this with a GT 610 now...The cpu has a boost clock of 4.90 Ghz, and with some tweaking in the bios power settings you can improve its performance, go watch some YouTube videos on bios setting for this CPU.I brought it for a wide variety of applications where I required the extra cores, such as: gaming and streaming simultaneously, media creation, and rendering videos. I was able to render a 49 minute video at 1080p, 60fps, 12 Mbits bitrate, vbr 2 pass, under an hour while doing other things!Yes, it was constantly at 100% usage, but I was very surprised that it never peaked over 68\u00b0C, I only used a hyper 212 evo black, no water cooling, just 1 cpu fan.My cpu never hit its maximum tdp of 95 Watts though, so I am still leaving some performance on the table.At idle, my cpu draws about 8-20 Watts running discord, chrome, and a bunch of background applications.It is disappointing Intel disabled hyperthreadding for this cpu, therefore the cores and threads are the same number.The Cpu won't be a bottleneck during gameplay, it will be up to the rest of your system to do their part.While recording and streaming, you can easily do x264 encoding at medium preset in OBS, and still have enough performance for the game.I upgraded from an I3-8100, it was cheaper than getting ryzen as I would have needed another motherboard.Beware that your motherboard may not be able to supply enough power for this processor, if its relatively cheap, and is not reccomended for overclocking, it may damage the capacitors on the motherboard from too much current, be sure to look for reviews on your motherboard first to make an informed decision, its better not to risk destroying your motherboard and or other parts of your computer.Q: Do I need an unlocked Cpu?A: Most likely not! However overclocking is for squeezing out even more performance form the Cpu, so even if you aren't planning to get the best performance in the world, it's good to know that when your Cpu eventually becomes underpowered in the next few years, you can always overclock it a bit more to be able to match newer generations of hardware. But in the short term they do cost more money to buy.I do not believe making a new system with this cpu is a good Idea, as you won't be future proofing yourself. So either get a newer generation of cpu or just wait for Intel or amd to make a cpu that won't change its socket the next generation.But hey, it's YOUR system! Do as you please!",
