Only got it because the old Pentium R 2030 was clearly not keeping up with my GPU and I wasn't ready to upgrade yet. It's like a whole new computer now. If you have a gen 3 motherboard you want to use for gaming and don't mind running on medium to low graphics, this is an easy choice. The i7 would obviously be better, but this one is notably cheaper and it's an old af gen of motherboards, so maybe don't spend too much on it and try to save for a whole system upgrade instead. Basically, get this if the processor you have isn't already from the iCore-series. Even it it's the same processor speed, this one will out perform it.",
