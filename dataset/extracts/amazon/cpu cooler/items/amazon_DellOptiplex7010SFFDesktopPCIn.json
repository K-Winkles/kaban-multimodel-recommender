                "reviewText": "I don't know how customer service from United PC TEK is because I didn't have to call or email them. The PC came as described in a very well packaged box, including a USB WiFi dongle, keyboard, and mouse. Both the inside and outside of the PC were immaculate. I don't know if the hard drive worked as I replaced it with a new SSD. I also added a PCIe network card. USB ports, NIC port, display ports, vga, power supply all work normally. Runs great so far. The PC was in perfect condition except for a few exterior scratches, otherwise I can't complain and would buy again. Not sure if the Windows Key worked either, as I am running Linux on it.",

                "reviewText": "Added another 4K of ram, a GForce-710 graphics card, and a 1TB SSD. Works like a champ, no problem whatsoever. Excellent computer at the renewal price. Renewal item looked like new and only evidence that it was not is the OEM version of Windows 10. Although advertised as Win10 Pro it was delivered as Win 10 Home but that is not a problem for me. Certainly recommend, especially if from the same vendor I used.",
