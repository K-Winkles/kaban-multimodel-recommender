I think it's picky on ram speed, I had it on a ddr4 and ddr5 board and it does not like going over 3000 on ddr4 or 4600 on ddr5. I'm not super techy so if you're going to pick presets that's where I ended up. Still worked great at those speeds. $$$ wise vs AMD you get a lot more cores on the i7 over the ryzen 7 and you can keep your ddr4 if you're not ready to fight with ddr5.",

I absolutely recommend using am AIO for your cooling solution. I would use at least a 240mm and wouldn't trust a 120.. chip doesn't run super hot, but don't think a 120mm would be up to the task.",

More power more cooling lol otherwise 5 star product nothing was damaged.",
