More performance, less power draw, less noise, better thermals. Don't buy an old used i7-4770 which will still go for $50 or more when you can buy this CPU new with fresh thermal paste and CPU cooler already included.The only issue you might face is finding a good offer for a motherboard but if you manage to do so you'll be ready for future upgrades. Mind you, you will need a dedicated graphics card or you might want to look for the non-\"f\" version.My order was shipped very fast and arrived in an original sealed box in immaculate condition which makes me a happy customer.",
