                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Using it in a challenging situation: Fractal Ridge + 5900x",
                "reviewText": "Install: I didn\u2019t have to do any mods or tweaks but the power cable is tight in Fractal. If you losen it and then put the cooler in then tighten it fits ok. Others i saw were using standoffs to hang the plug out. You can do that too, but i didn't need to.Cooling wise in a 64 degree house, the cpu, 5900x, will climb up to 70\u2019s (max) under usage with a pretty strong fan ramp in a small form factor case (the ridge). Its acceptable, but don\u2019t expect any kind of magic or dead silent fan but you can tame even higher powered cpus with the right tweaks well. I can get it closer to what you would expect in a large case with a larger cooler if i turn off pbo, and am careful with cable placement. I'll run it in the 30's-40s with general computing. I also use fan curve software. THe 5900x runs a similar heat level to most higher end desktop cpus and that's a very small case, with a beefy gpu by the way so this fan does work. By the way my fist attempt was lack luster i had to remount with a bit more paste. Your tolerances are very tight with coolers, more so in these challenging situations.Here is a comparison, I\u2019ve also got a 13900k which is much hotter than this but its on a d15 and far away from my head and i don\u2019t normally hear it unless im running a compile and that\u2019s also in a gigantic tower with a lot of supporting cooling. i\u2019 not saying the cooler is bad it\u2019s really good, or the case is bad or the cpu is bad. The combination is just pushing it, it can be done, it\u2019s not bad if you fiddle a bunch with fan curvs and get everything else right in your build (really clean).THe funny thing is this is a cooler that 's really goign to be put into much harder situations than many larger coolers, in general, so just keep that in mind for best results. SFX is a lot of fun, but it can take some fiddeling up wards of 20c quite easily with some adjustments. II will say that it\u2019 s a good cooler. Have realistic expectations though with a cpu like a 5900x in a sfx case like the ridge. One issue with the ridge is the air flow can create some resonance and the fans are fairy close to the grill. I had to fiddle with fan curve quite a bit, actually that case is great, and the cooler as wel but it's also pushing the size of what that case can handle the closer you get to the grill the louder the fans get, and that means you have to slow them down. the physical install was really easy, but the main issue is just tweaking and tweaking until you can quiet case and the power plug in that case is gigantic and takes some finess. My case is pretty close to my head and the fan is pointed right at me so it\u2019s not the most forgiving.The other thing that\u2019s great about this cooler is the ram compat is fantastic.My opinion overall is this cooler is kind of the definition of threading the needle. That\u2019s a compliment.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great SFF cooler that has a great mounting system and has lots of headroom for newer CPUs. But unfortunately case compatibility is still an issue with this cooler, at least for AMD systems. I tried using this cooler in the Fractal Ridge with an AMD build and in both directions the Ridge's power extension cord was in the way. If there was a second set of brackets included for AMD systems I might have been able to rotated it sideways and have it fit. Intel builds won't have this issue since you can install it four ways instead of two. Replacement power extension cords do exist but they're hard to find and of questionable quality. Go with another cooler if you are building an AMD system in the Fractal Ridge case.",

                "reviewText": "The DeepCool AN600 low profile CPU cooler is a high quality product that is capable of cooling most of today's processors. The cooler is able to dissipate heat in my i7 8700K known for being a hot chip when under full load.The device is well made and easy to install with many accessories included that allow the cooler to cover a wide variety of chipsets from both AMD and intel. The fan is a bit loud at full load when it's at around 1850rpm.Compared to a 360mm AIO water cooler the AN600 impressed me with its abilities. The fan is able to keep the CPU almost as cool as the AIO water cooler within 8C. The fan comes closer to the AIO water cooler ability as eventually the radiator of the AIO gets saturated with heat and looses its ability to keep the CPU at a low temperature during spikes, the AN600 does not have this issue and quickly cools the chip after putting it under load for extended periods.The cooler comes with thermal paste however I used a high quality one from another manufacturer to ensure plbest performance from the device and make comparison to the water cooler that I normally use.Overall this is a great quality product that is easy to install and looks great with its low profile (some coolers can be massive). Great value from a reputable manufacturer considering the price point. This cooler may not have RGB lighting or look as nice as other coolers however it works great and has a good price especially on sale.",
