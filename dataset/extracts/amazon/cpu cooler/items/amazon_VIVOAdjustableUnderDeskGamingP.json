                "reviewText": "I bought this for my standing desk I was assembling, thinking that it would be good to get my PC off of the ground. It was slightly difficult to install, having no easy way to line up/predrill the holes into my desk.It supports the computer tower by using 2 springs and 2 locking friction arms, which means that it struggles with the weight of my PC, slowly lowering it even though my PC is below the maximum weight of 33 lbs. Additionally, due to it not being able to support the weight, the small plastic piece on the bottom of the computer bends out, leaving my computer leaning in the holder. I solved the problem by wrapping paracord around my PC and the device to lock it into place.It also doesn't hold my computer completely securely as my computer doesn't have a fully flat top, leaving my computer susceptible to slightly rocking back and forth. If they provided an arm on the top, the same as on the bottom, I would feel less worried about my computer tipping out.Finally, if you have a tower with top mounted power buttons, USB ports, etc. It it almost impossible to use them as the arm doesn't space the tower low enough. Pros:-Good for larger (lighter) computer towers-Good PriceCons:-Does not support 33 lbs as it suggests.-Somewhat difficult to install-Flimsy lower arm-Doesn't work well for PC's with top buttonsOverall, this device is a good device, and I've had it mounted under my standing desk for about 2 months. If you have a bulkier/heavier/non-flat-topped tower, make sure you take that into consideration before buying this product.",

                "reviewText": "I was going to build custom boxes for two lab PCs until I saw these. I took a chance and have been very pleased with how they have worked out. I have a custom 6 foot table/desk I made recently and did not want my PCs sitting on the floor pulling in all the junk and dust that is unavoidable in any clean home. I mounted these under each end under the desk and fitted a large XPS PC in one side and a newer Optiplex 7000 in the other side. These PC mounts adjust in size to hold each and also makes dealing with rear cable management a breeze. I would definitely consider these for my next PC project.",

When I got my computer in it - The computer was too heavy for it, and it just bent the unit.I tried all sorts of things to make it work, but in the end it's just a piece of trash. I suppose if you've got some sort of mini PC or a special build that's ultra-light... It might work for you.Only reason it gets two stars is because it's relatively cheap. If it were much more expensive I'd probably give it one. Like... 5 bucks more and it'd be a one star review.",
