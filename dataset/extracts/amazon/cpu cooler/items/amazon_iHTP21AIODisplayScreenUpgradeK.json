                "reviewText": "After owning this display for a day I have mixed feelings. It definitely has its pros and cons. It's a great device if you already own an aio. I have this on a vetroo v360 and it fits perfectly. I'm sure it'll fit similar coolers such as the cooler master liquid cooler and the ID Cooling ones. As far as a plug and play device, the driver installation was straightforward and I had this thing up and running in about 10 minutes. My only issue is the lcd screen stays on when my PC is off and I have yet to figure out how to fix that. If you're looking for something that's plug and play while on a budget, I think this is for you. Let's say you get a budget aio such as a 360mm ID cooling for $80 and get this device for $60. $140 total is much cheaper than corsair LCD 360mm aio for $300. The software isn't as up to par as corsair or NZXT, but that's to be expected. Hopefully the developers offer continuous support for the software.",

It perfectly sticks on top of my Lian Li Galahad 2, but I guess any rounded pumps could do.The stickers included with the screen is tight and stable enough, although I had to cut it to better fit my aio shape.The screen works great and the software accepts images or gifs of your preference. Shows data according to 10 to 15 templates.To fit the usb into my motherboard, I had to purchase a usb hub like the nzxt.Very satisfied to be honest.",
