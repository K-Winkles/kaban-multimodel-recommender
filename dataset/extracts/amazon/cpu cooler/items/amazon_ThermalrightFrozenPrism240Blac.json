            "\u3010Brand Profile\u3011Thermalright is a Taiwanese brand with more than 20 years of development history. It has a certain popularity in the domestic and foreign markets, and has a decisive influence in the cooler market. We have been focusing on the research and development of computer accessories, and the research and development product line includes: CPU air-cooler/water-cooler radiators, case fans, thermal paste, fan controllers, mounting brackets and other products.",
            "\u3010Unique pump design\u3011The pump is the architecture of the fourth generation pump body (Frozen V1.0), the pump body adopts magnetic removable top cover design, sleek octagonal appearance, equipped with 5V ARGB light effect, can bring dazzling visual effects, low vibration operation,all aluminum alloy shell, water block\u2019s life up to 40,000 hours, speed up to 3300RPM\u00b110%, to ensure long-term and excellent CPU cooling.",
            "\u3010ARGB God Light Synchronization\u3011 The ARGB of the cpu fan and water block and the 5V 3pin on the motherboard realize lighting synchronization, 1600W color soft light effect, efficient cooling while providing rich lighting effects, supporting series connection of lighting effects, avoiding the situation of insufficient light slots.",
            "\u3010More cooling details optimization\u3011The fan of the integrated CPU liquid cooler adopts the insulation grade PBT+PC material, Stably-FDB bearing solves the problem of fan blade shaking in the lifting mode.",
            "\u3010Dual PWM fan temperature control\u3011With TL-E12 series fan, the CPU fan with temperature control function can automatically adjust the speed according to the temperature, and the injection of steel core copper bushing makes the S-FDB bearing of the fan more obvious, not only reducing friction and vibration, but also reducing sound and prolonging life during operation. The high speed of 1850RPM combined with the CPU water radiator can quickly carry away the high temperature."

Idle with the air cooler is like 40-50C and gaming with it can get up to 75-80C.This AIO falls into my budget and works wonderful. Easy to install, and cool my whole pc down a lot better. Idle with the AIO is around 30-35C now, and gaming only get up to 60-70C (mind you Im playing cyberpunk to get it that hot).One thing to notice, the radiator\u2019s fan default are output fans so it will take air from inside pc and blow it out. If you want it to be input fans, just unscrew the fans and flip it before install it. Also, the fans are strong af without being too loud. Just absolutely fantastic cooling.",

                "reviewText": "I originally purchased this for use on my test bench. I regularly use it to test both AMD and Intel CPUs and needed something that worked well and was easy to install. Installation was straightforward and I was up and running in under 10 mins. First test was with an Intel I9-9900k and the cooler kept it cool enough to not throttle under an Aida64 8-hour stress test. The next test was with an AMD Ryzen 9 5900x and again it stayed nice and cool under a long stress test. The RGB looks good and is easily controlled by motherboard software.One thing of note is that the pump seems to be a bit noisy. I have the radiator mounted above the pump so that the pump is flooded. For some reason the pump is just noisy. Mind you this is on an open-air test bench sitting right next to me, so I am sure it won't be as noticeable if it was mounted in a case.All in all, I will continue to buy Thermalright products as they work just as well as some of the super high-end products at half the cost.",

                "reviewText": "This is one hell of an AIO for the price. Sure, you can get a better AIO or one with fancy software that connections to everything for a lot more money, but this will do almost anything you need.I went with TR RGB fans and while these don't look exactly the same, they look close enough. They all connect easily to the headers on the motherboard and sync up nicely. I have been very happy with how well it works. It keeps a 7700X nice and cool while letting it to boost as far as it wants. Included thermal paste is acceptable. Absolutely blown away by how good this thing functions, I am hoping that it stands the test of time.",
