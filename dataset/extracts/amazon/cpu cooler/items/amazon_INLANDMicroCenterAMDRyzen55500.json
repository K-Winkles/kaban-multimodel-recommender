Youtube is your best friend here, just search each issue you have one at a time to see fixes with helped me a lot. I am not a expert but have built a few PC's. Once done, it seems like a nice system.NOTE: I still have one major issue and that is bluetooth. I have a bluetooth keyboard and it connects fine (MXKEYS) but as soon as you reboot the system no bluethooth devices auto reconnect. I also tried with sony x1000 headphones and same issue. You have to go and reconnect after every boot. Not sure if this is a windows 11 issue or this motherboard bluetooth issue.",

Just be careful to google bios upgrade videos and carefully follow the instructions. My video card installed covered SATA drive connectors 1 and 2, so install those cables before you install video card. Or you have to remove and reinstall it. Plenty of info out there on installation process. I kept my drives and video card, but new would not be an issue. I recommend the Samsung SSD drives, super easy with their software to transfer operation system in old drive to the Samsung. I added this new one. Yea go for it. Been years since I did my last build and very pleased with results.",

                "reviewText": "After hrs of frustration and trouble shooting the mother boars isn't properly working. It will NOT activate the graphics card. 2 different brand new graphics cards were installed on the board in attempt to boot the computer. Both did not boot. And both cards worked fine in a completely separate computer. As part of a controlled experiment and trouble shoot. The board ran every other item but wouldn't let me boot the computer to install windows. Or any other continued set up processes. On most of the forums many people have had similar issues and problems. Aparently it's a bios fault the board will just not move past start up or locate graphics card to give you a screen. To continue install. If it works at a later date then I might change the review. All it's given me is a expensive paperweight.",
