                "reviewText": "I have looked at a few AIOS from different brands, but as I have never had an issue with Corsair I decided to go for them.When the new ICUE link system came about, I wanted something to make the process of installing it easier. Well this certainly does that.My main issue was the cables that it comes with, they should have included right angles ones but I made it work.If you want something easy to set up, this is it. I upgraded the fans as well at the same time to this eco system. It is quite expensive though, but i would recommend it",
