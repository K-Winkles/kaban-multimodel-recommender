Luckily it held out till this once came in and could replace it.This one is very quiet and with the lights, really cast a glow through the case ventilation holes.Installation can be tricky, if you've never done one like this before. I had a similar setup so was maybe easier for me.Depending on case layout and orientation and size of hands, it might be easier to install the fan first to the heatsink, then the heatsink to the CPU. Your setup and experience can help determine that.Once installed, turned the Compter on and it was like an aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh moment. After dealing with the old one for a while.Good price.Can't hear it from my desk or hers... Local crickets are louder.",
