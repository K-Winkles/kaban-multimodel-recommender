The only downside is that it doesn\u2019t have any integrated gpu if you ever need to troubleshoot but realistically, it\u2019s not a huge deal. It\u2019s worth getting even going into 2024, the changes haven\u2019t been drastic enough to spend the absurd amount for modern cpus. If you can get a 13600k instead or even 14600k, go that route but if you\u2019re on a heavy budget, buy this.",

I have this chip paired with Corsair Vengeance DDR5 5200 RAM, a Asus TUF Z690,1X Fire Cuda 530 Gen 4 NVMe SSD, Alseye M120D cooler and a case with 7 fans, crushed 4tb data file transfers across old drives in about 12 hours, never got hotter then 62C in any of my bench tests and maintains an average temp of 35C while general use. startup is 0-15C until you heat it up first time then it doesn't seem to drop below 32 until a shut down for a while. I had it off all day on second day, turned it on and logged in, got distracted on my cell phone for 1 hour then looked at temp, and it was 12C. checked 3 different sources all read same. then i ran a game for 15 mins and it got to 43C. i stopped the game and left it for an hour to see what it did with nothing really running. it immediately dropped to 36 when i shut game off within under 5 seconds.After 20 mins of it pegged at 36 i maxed out the fans then took the hour to drop to 32 to see if it made a difference. 0 change. anyway Skoocum chip and it isn't even the best you can get right now. plus gen 14 is right around corner ;)",
