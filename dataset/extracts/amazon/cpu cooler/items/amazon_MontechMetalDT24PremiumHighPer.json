I knew I was going to use an air cooler and found the price and power of the DT24 appealing. The large size concerned me a bit, but know I was going to use the Sky Two case (Montech as well) I knew they'd play well together. Extremely easy to install, had all the necessary brackets for the LGA 1200 (the fan came with the 1700 and AMD 4 & 5 as well). It's a big cooler and once I turned on the PC for the first time, everything was running full speed. Once I calibrated the fans in the bios, it was silent and cool. The only way I knew anything was on was seeing the fans spinning.Great combination with the Sky Two case.",

                "reviewText": "The unit is solid and well made. Comes with all latest mounting hardware. For the price, it does well.I installed the base model on an AMD Ryzen 7900X. Under load those are claimed to jump right to 95C. I don't think I've ever seen it go over 85 with this cooler. (But I didn't do a full load until after I set the 135 Watt power mode in the BIOS.)Some people will like the extra RAM clearance. I personally will never buy RAM that needs it.I love that there's no RGB nonsense. I installed this in a case with a metal side panel. I'm never going to see the cooler anyway.For noise, I don't care. I've heard louder fans for sure. So it's probably good in that regard.Complaint: The mounting screws are needlessly too short. You have to push so much that you feel like you're going to break something, just to get them to the point where you can start to tighten them. I say needlessly because they have springs on them to even-out the pressure. Just make them longer and let the springs do their job.I did not use the supplied thermal paste. So I cannot comment on it's quality.",
