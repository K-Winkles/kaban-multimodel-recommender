                "reviewText": "This is a great single tower cpu cooler especially if you are going for an all black aesthetic! It\u2019s only 4 heat pipes single stack with one pwm 120mm fan so it fits in the same range of cpu cooling abilities as the rest of them. For gaming it can cool higher end cpus, but if you do cpu taxing tasks you probably will want a beefier cooler for 100w plus cpus. But for all lower and mid tier cpus like 65w TDP this is great! And like I said, gaming doesn\u2019t push cpus like a stress test so it can handle 105 to 120w rated cpus for gaming. The design is great for making sure you have plenty of ram clearance. The fan seems very well built with solid rubber pads and mounting was simple. I\u2019ll use it on a AMD 5600x comparing to the stock wraith cooler but won\u2019t have data till next week, so I\u2019ll post an update. So far so good though and looks great!UPDATE: I was able to run a thermal test with this cooler today. Using a Ryzen 5 5600x cpu and the CPUID software, I ran a 3 minute 100% cpu stress test. With the stock AMD wraith cooler that it came with it got up to 78 degrees and was still rising slowly. After replacing it with the Darkrock PX4 it only got up to 61C and was leveled off. (Used the same thermal paste Arctic MX4) Also the glass of my pc case is noticeably cooler to the touch after gaming sessions (high settings high fps 1440p with RTX 3070). It just does a better job cooling the cpu and pushing the hot air out the back of the case instead of just spreading it all around the case like those stock AMD coolers. Great for this cpu!",

                "reviewText": "Grabbed this cooler on a whim and impressed by it so far. Threw it on a 12600k in an ITX build. Very happy with the results - keeps it around 58*C under an all-core stress test for a couple of hours. Really impressively for such a budget cooler.Aside from performance, the other thing I'm impressed by is volume. The fan is one of the more quiet ones I've heard - or, not heard? Cooler looks great, too. All black is always in.Careful though: the fins are ridiculously sharp. I sliced my thumb and now I guess I can say there are literal blood, sweat and tears in this system. Good news is that you don't actually need to risk life and limb since the fan comes pre-installed (I switched orientation of mine due to the ITX case).Honestly one of the best performing budget coolers I've ever used.",

The mounting screws don't reach the brackets at placement. I had to tip it slightly to one side, get that screw started and then leverage the unit the opposite direction to get the other screw to thread, and then tighten back and fourth as directed. Might be because the way my mobo is designed (GIGABYTE B650 Gaming X AX). In the end it worked, but it made me nervous having to man handle it like that.",
