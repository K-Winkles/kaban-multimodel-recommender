The radial cooler and the mounting spots are designed so that the centre of the cooler is centred on the CPU. Thus, the processor\u2019s hotspot in all variants is covered by the aluminium core. Easy And Tool-Free Installation Installation is very easy thanks to the push pins and the cooler\u2019s light weight. The cooler can be easily mounted on the built-in motherboard without any tools. Thanks to the snap-in mechanism of the push pins, the cooler can be reliably installed at all times, even in the case of vibrations. Wide rpm Range The Alpine 17 LP features an updated motor with a very wide PWM-controlled RPM range from 300 up to 3000 RPM. At low system load, the fan switches off almost completely. This keeps the noise level at a minimum while offering maximum cooling performance under stress.",

The MX-4 from ARCTIC is characterised above all by its very good long-term durability. High-Quality Bearing Thanks to an alloy/lubricant combination developed in Germany, friction inside the bearing is reduced and higher efficiency is achieved. As a result, there is less heat development, less bearing noise and the service life of the fan is extended. Great Technology The extra fine Y-shaped, fanned-out cooling fins ensure a considerable increase in the cooling surface and optimisation of airflow. A novel production process makes it possible to extrude the fins even more finely without making them unstable. This enables the production of a powerful, but at the same time, very flat and compact radial heat sink.",

                "reviewText": "I hate giving a negative review to an item that is now performing its job perfectly well. But I believe I went far above what most people would have done to get to this point. And it's possible that my combination of processor and motherboard exacerbated the problem, but I have no way to judge that... and unfortunately, neither will you...So the downside first: it just didn't fit. I've built a lot of computers, and when it comes time to install the CPU cooler, you learn that you have to push down vigorously on the mounting pins to lock them in place. The instructions even show the difference between \"unlocked\" and \"locked\" mounting pins as they protrude through the mounting holes in the motherboard. No matter how hard I tried, pushing down with my considerable body weight applied, I could not get all four mounting pins to their \"locked\" position. I could tell this was going to be a problem because the cooler could rock from side to side as it sat on the processor. (my combo was a MSI motherboard and an Intel i7-12700K processor). Was the processor too thick?I literally spent a couple HOURS trying to get this cooler installed, completely evaporating the value of buying one of the most inexpensive coolers... even my (retired) hours are worth more than this. At some point I was afraid I might have damaged the processor - how much pressure can they take being squeezed into a socket? MOST people would have given up by now and returned the unit, but sadly I'm not \"most\" people. Off to the garage to grind down the metal heat sink...Whew, that aluminum is surprisingly robust! It took another hour and a lot of inhaled aluminum dust to grind down that heat sink. Yes, I was using my belt sander, but I really thought it would be easier than it was... that solid aluminum core doesn't give way easily. After an enormous amount of work, I probably shaved off only a mm or so... but fortunately, that was enough. When I reinstalled the heat sink to the fan, and applied some thermal paste (I had ground off the pre-applied paste), the mounting pins clicked into place with what I felt was the appropriate amount of pressure applied.So now... the cooler is running fine and quite silently, and keeping the processor temperature well inside the \"safe\" zone. My sub-$10 cooler was a bargain if you don't consider the $100 worth of effort. Maybe try it and if it works for you, great - but if it doesn't fit - don't think twice!!! - return it!",
