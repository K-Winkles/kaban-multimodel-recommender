                "reviewText": "Pros:++Decent cooling for average to above average loads.++Sleek look with all black radiator and fan frames.++Gun metal color tube sleeves reflect led lighting well.Cons:--Tubes on mine are rather twisted feeling. They don't bend naturally, or without tension.--Fans aren't the best. They get decent rpms, 1800 or so max based on what my motherboard tells me. But they don't push much air through the radiator. They're definitely not static pressure fans.--Also, RGB sucks on the fans. Really dim, and the color mixing sucks. It never matches the other LEDs in my case, or even the pump head. I can barely see them through the tinted front glass of my caseOk... So let me get this out of the way... For being one of the lowest priced AIOs I've seen on Amazon, you MUST go into buying it with the expectation of manufacturing flaws, and cheap materials. That said, it's really not that bad. Some people seem to expect Corsair level quality for this low price.Also, you'll get optimum performance out of this cooler with using a top-mount with fans pushing out as exhaust (if using the 240mm model, try using the mounts closer to the front of the case, if available) or a front-mount pushing in fresh through the radiator from the outside. Although on the front-mount, try to orient the radiator with the tubes exiting at the bottom. This will keep any air bubbles from getting caught in the pump and running it dry. There is a decent amount of air in my system (typical of AIOs, usually a 10% air gap) and I only heard any air bubble noise when my hoses we're at the top while front mounted. Mainly, don't make the pump the highest point in the loop.But, it is a decent little cooler to add to a prebuilt or low- to mid-level gaming or workstation PC. It cools my Ryzen 5 3600 while multi tasking with Premiere Pro, switching Chrome tabs, and browsing files all at once. Plus it keeps up with any gaming as well. I have tested under a few different circumstances and it hasn't seen above 72 degrees yet (current setup, front mounted with fans pulling in fresh air. Tubes at bottom of radiator).I'd say it does the job. Priced cheap enough to improve it's flaws easily. It's worth the buy if you're still running a stock air cooler.",

                "reviewText": "System Specs:Ryzen 5 3600 OC'd to 4.45 ghzGigabyte b450m MOBOPny RTX 2060 OC'd +.1 ghz32gb ddr4 3600mhz OLOY Warhawk memory1.5 tb ssd 2.5\" pnyI have had this for over a month and there is a HUGE difference from the stock cooler that came with my CPU.When running benchmarks with the wraith cooler I would see temps spike to 85c with a lower clock speed than what I have now.Currently overclocked to 4.45ghz and even running more intensive games or work loads, the max I have seen is 78c. (with a higher clock speed 4.3 GHZ @ 85c vs 4.45GHZ @78c same tests) Measured with coretemp app.Cinebench23 with new cooler higher clock scored 10116, which is impressive, since it didnt get over 78c on a more budget friendly CPU.Noise level? I would give it an 8 out of 10 ONLY because of my particular case. The reason being is that the wires that go to my on/off buttons prevent me from being able to raise the radiator all the way to the top of the mounting bracket, thus making the top of the radiator parallel to the top of the water pump. (which can occasionally cause the \"aquarium\" noise of the pump moving air, only happens 1% of time so i am not worried about longevity due to it)If this was in a different case where the buttons didn't interfere with mounting, there would be 0 noise due to air being unable to get into the pump.Performance? 10/10 for the money! will be purchasing again either for myself or holiday gift.Aesthetics? 9/10 Rgb lights are nice, the fans are quality, and come with a manual controller if you don't want to download software to control the lights color. only slight issue is that you cant rotate the pump cover to make the ID logo the right angle unless you mount the pump a certain way. This does not bother me.Installation? 8/10 Pretty Straight forward, the instructions were \"legible-ish\" at least the have pictures to show you what to do. My only issue is the bracket design for the back of the MOBO is kinda hard to hold in place while mounting, would recommend a 3rd hand if available, I managed to get it by myself, but would have saved 30 mins if I had help.Value? 11/10 I STRONGLY recommend this case to anyone who wants better performance out of their rig. Adding water cooling to your system will give you overclocking options that most air coolers will not, and doing so will give you more performance.",

WIth this 240mm AIO I cooled an i7 5820K overclocked to 4.4 Ghz and it kept it from overheating, temperatures didn't rise over 70 degrees , so it does the job well - not class winning but more than good enough for decent overclocks , just dont expect elite level overclock headroomThe pump and fans have Addressable RGB inputs ( 5V data Ground) , so can plugged and controlled straight from the majority of modern motherboards . The kit also comes with its own RGB controller that allows some basic light effects to the pump and fans .My only complaint is that the branding sticker on the radiator was not straight but easily fixed . For the money it is terrific value .In my case I did not use the included fans but aftermarket ones , since a set of 5 were cheaper than finding additional ID cooling fans .",

I have plenty of spare fans so chucked a couple of different high static pressure fans on there, and the system is actually running cooler and quieter, but pretty unimpressed overall.On the plus side, the cost of this cooler plus another set of fans is still cheaper than the nearest big brand competitor.",

My previous coolermaster 120mm aio was totally silent on 100% pump cycle duty so it's a little annoying to now have to limit this pump to 70% - 80%. Thankfully even with the pump at 70% the cooling performance is still better than my old 120mm at 100% so all in all I'm happy.",
