It now offers compatibility with a wide range of Intel and AMD server processors, including Intel's LGA 4189 and LGA 4677, as well as AMD's SP6, sTR5, SP3, TR4, sTRX4, and sWRX8 sockets. Remarkably, despite its impressive cooling capabilities, the Freezer 4U consumes a mere 2.88 watts, ensuring exceptional efficiency in cooling even the most powerful processors with up to 96 cores and a TDP of up to 350 Watts. RAM Compatibility and Clearance The Freezer 4U offers a spacious 53 mm of RAM clearance, allowing for the use of memory sticks with moderate heatsinks.This clearance allows efficient airflow and enables compatibility with different RAM variants. Compact Design and Dual Socket Compatibility With an optimised installation height of only 145 mm, it fits into both classic 4U server racks and most consumer 4U cases available on the market. The Freezer 4U features a compact design with dimensions of just 156 x 124 mm. This also makes it suitable for dual-socket motherboards. To adjust the airflow direction if required, the fans can be easily swapped over.",

                "media_text": "Powerful Fans in Push-Pull Configuration The installed PWM fans benefit from all the advantages of the award-winning P series. Designed for static pressure, the fans are ideal for the Freezer 4U-M's high fin density and provide efficient heat dissipation in push-pull mode, even in power-hungry applications. Especially office workstations benefit from the quiet fans. The dual configuration also allows for inherent redundancy and protects the system from total shutdown caused by heat. Designed for continuous operation Both fans of the Freezer 4U-M are equipped with dual ball bearings, which allows for 24/7 continuous operation without the slightest compromise in performance. This type of bearing is much more resistant to defilement and wear caused by high temperatures than conventional sleeve bearings or Fluid-Dynamic bearing and is therefore the perfect choice if you want to ensure fault-free continuous operation. Premium Thermal Paste Included The Freezer 4U-M comes with MX-6 thermal paste. ARCTIC's Ultimate Performance thermal paste reduces the heat build-up between the heatspreader of the CPU and the cooler. The thermal paste is neither conductive nor capacitive and therefore absolutely safe to use.",

                "reviewText": "Can handle a xeon w 4677 overclocked to 500w at 90c.The torx screws are metal, unlike most other solutions which are plastic. This made it difficult to align for a lga 4677 mount.The cold plate does not fully cover the IHS. Corners are missing and aluminum block appears to be narrower than the IHS. I hope this is fine?The fins look like a simple press fit, which means missing potential but I guess it is some cost saving measures.Biggest complaint is fan reparability and bearing noises. There is no option to buy replacements from Arctic or adapt other 120 fans without some serious DIY. The bearing noises are very penetrative and annoying at lower rpms.Will be a good stopgap solution.",
