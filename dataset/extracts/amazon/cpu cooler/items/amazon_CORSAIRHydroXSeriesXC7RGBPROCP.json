Is it the absolute best? No, but the difference is small, and if you're using this, you're getting it for the screen anyway, not premium thermal performance. The good news is that it works well. Apparently when these launched you couldn't rotate the display in iCue, but you can now and it's easy. One thing to note is that while iCue is running it's going to display temps, which I like, and it will play the fun gifs when iCue closes, so startup and shut down, unless you keep the gif menu open, then it will loop for as long as you want. In practice this makes a lot of sense, I think a gif looping all the time would get old pretty fast. Anyway, it's very fun, and it's easy to set up.",

Easy to install in the sense that Corsair provides a guiding bracket/frame and instructions on how to mount to the CPU -- was super helpful!! \ud83d\ude02 also, they have a layer of thermal paste evenly pre-applied, so as long as you don't do something crazy (or unless you want better paste and replace it yourself), you can easily mount it with very little prior experience.In terms of visual appeal and overall quality of materials I am very happy with this purchase!!! It adds such a nice element to the build and does a great job keeping my CPU temp in check. It can be a bit of a daunting task getting everything in order for a Corsair build, but it's so worth it!!! Thank you Corsair for keeping quality *and* aesthetic appeal top of mind!",

My only gripe is I wish the screws were actual screws instead of hand screws. It's next to impossible to twist them in a small case, and keeping the torque even is difficult, if not possible.",

I wanted to add the CPU to my GPU custom water loop and added another radiator at the same time and am very happy with how corsairs systems all work together. iCUE has helped me cool my computer and build my custom loop with ease. So long as I was able to get the hardware in the right place, they were able to handle the software well.",

Da ich den K\u00fchler so ungef\u00e4hr zum Release Zeitpunkt erstanden habe hatte ich das Tal der Tr\u00e4nen durchlaufen m\u00fcssen, aber die Software Fehler sind heutzutage Behoben und ich bin recht happy mit dem Artikel.Der Feler der mich am l\u00e4ngsten triggerte, war das man die Orientierung noch einstellen konnte. Heutzutage ist es ja kein Problem mehr, aber ich musste f\u00fcr die Zeit eben meine Videos 90\u00b0 drehen und konnte damals auch nur diese Video nutze, denn alles andere war eben um 90\u00b0 zur Seite gekippt.Einen Kritikpunkt habe ich aber noch, der Temperatursensor. Denn was er misst ist weder Fisch noch Fleisch, da er weder die Temperatur des CPU noch die des Wassers an dem Punkt des Loop erfasst. Denn meine Wassertemperatur wird von meiner Pumpe, am Ausgang der GPU, dann vom XC7 und nach den Radiatoren noch vom Flowmesser zum Reservoir hin. Bei allen anderen 3 Sensoren liegt der Wert bis auf ein Grad gleich. Aber da ja weder das Wasser noch die CPU selbst mit dem Sensor gemessen wird kommt im XC7 immer ein Wert der mindestens 5 Grad mehr zeigt heraus.",
