Shut down your system, unplug the power and unplug the current cables from the unit you're replacing, use the allen wrench that is included to remove the old unit from the pump. install screws in the pump, install lcd screen, plug wires in where they need to go. It should show up automatically in icue when you start your system back up. In my case, the screen worked but it was not seen in icue, re-installing the software did not fix this, I ended up using a powered usb corsair hub to plug in both of my commanders and the usb header coming from the lcd. This was then plugged to my motherboard and now icue sees the lcd screen.",

After restarting the PC icue needed to update again and it showed up, this after I checked for updates after initial install. Product is amazing as Corsair usually is, but software isn\u2019t that good either like icue usually is.",

Came across this Corsair water pump cap with an IPS display that fits my H150i Elite Capellix AIO and can be programmed via iCUE to display pretty much anything one could imagine - including gifs!It took under 30 minutes to swap out the old pump cap for the new one with the only tool needed being an allen wrench included with the kit. After updating iCUE and the firmware for the display it took about five minutes to add the display to my \"mural\" and program it for the two temperature readings. Then, for when the grandkids come by, I set up a gif of them celebrating the New Year :)Cheers!",

DO NOT RESTART YOUR PC or it might not come back on.Instead exit icue , restart it, it will automatically download and update the driver and will change over to the new installation.Happy Gaming \ud83d\ude0a",
