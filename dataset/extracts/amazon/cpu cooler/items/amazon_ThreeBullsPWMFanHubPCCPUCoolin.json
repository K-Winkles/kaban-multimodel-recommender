Works great with case fans where you just want them to all spin at the same speed.Where ever you plug it into the motherboard, just set the fan type to DC mode in BIOS.For Windows folk, you can use the FanControl software to either have the fans speed at a steady rate or set it to change based on a temperature source. I've got mine set to a steady 55% - and the system keeps cool and the fans are inaudible. Of course, depending on the fans you are using YMMV.Either way - very good result for the price.",

I needed four!!! I quickly searched for PWM SPLITTERS on Amazon and was relieved to find THIS SPLITTER which has FIVE 4-PIN PWM's (1 CPU & 4 FAN). I did not require the ONE CPU 4-PIN, but I needed exactly FOUR FAN 4-PIN. I plugged the splitter into CHA_FAN1 and, after some degree of cable managing, I peeled the paper off of the bottom and stuck it comfortably to the bottom of the case.Altogether I'm glad they made this. It works perfectly for what I need it for.Salutations.",

If you are looking into this as a way to power a pump on an AIO, I HIGHLY suggest you do not buy or use this product for that. That being said, the adapter itself has 5 headers, allowing you to power 5 fans off 1 MB header. I personally would not recommend running more than 3-4 fans off this product, especially if you're new to building PC's. Note that the first header labeled \" CPU \" must be the first fan position when using this product. After the first 3 headers, the 4th and 5th will supply power, but will not run your fans at full power. If you have an experience like others on in the reviews of the product catching fire or so called \" exploding \" then you are either running too much power to the product or your MB cannot supply 5 fans on the product. As for the wiring itself, it's very well sleeved and protected. It's length however is rather short so definitely plan ahead on your fan placements and header locations on your motherboard. The sleeve on this product is very difficult to bend and manipulate, I suggest you only bend the cable at areas that are not directly near the header or the actual board itself, it felt fragile. I would recommend this product to anyone intending to add more than 5-10 fans within their build, just make sure to check your MB support.",

                "reviewText": "It arrived early. Order placed Oct. 28, arrived Oct 31. It wasn\u2019t supposed to arrive until Nov. 3rd, so I\u2019m quite happy about that.I love the quality. I love the braded cable. I also hadn\u2019t realized it would have a sticker on the back to hold it in place, if and when I decide on a good permanent location. That's a nice touch.It\u2019s solid, clearly marked, and works exactly as I had hoped it would. I am using it to control the fans in my AIO radiator and after inspecting it thoroughly, I feel confident I have made a good decision, and it can be relied on.",
