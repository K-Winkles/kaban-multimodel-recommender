This leads to extremely high thermal conductivity, ensuring that heat is dissipated quickly and efficiently from the CPU or GPU. With its outstanding performance, the MX-4 is not only an excellent choice for overclockers and enthusiasts, but also for other sapplications that require thermal transmission. Easy application Thanks to its consistency, MX-4 is easy to apply, even for beginners. The video in the picture gallery demonstrates the application technique to avoid air pockets between processors and coolers. Secure usage In contrast to pastes based on metal oxides or liquid metal, ARCTIC\u2019s MX-4 is metal-free and not electrically conductive. This eliminates the risk of short circuiting, and eliminates the need to worry about corrosion damage to the radiator floor caused by liquid metal. 100 % original through Authenticity Check To ensure that your paste is genuine, there is the ARCTIC Authenticity Check. This allows every product to be reliably verified. A counterfeit offers neither the performance nor the durability of the original ARCTIC pastes.",

                "reviewText": "I am about a week on the other side of a recent system build. Meaning that the new system has been in service for about a week. Why did I label this an under-appreciated item? Because without it the CPU probably wouldn't have lasted a minute. Ok, the truth is that if one is building on a motherboard built this century, then the board itself is probably smart enough to shut things down before the CPU cooks. But if one has built a system in the past year, then one knows just how difficult it is to get the core components at present. So, yeah, cooking the CPU would have a more profound and less recoverable connotation.Enter, thermal paste. More specifically, enter one of the most recent formulations of thermal paste. I chose this one because it has significantly higher thermal transmission gradient than the best formulations available just a few years ago, and came in at half the price of its next competitor (at the time of purchase). In reality, they are all priced about the same, but many come with half the volume of stuff inside the tube. And suppose one makes a mistake the first time had needs a do-over (that didn't happen to me, but I prepared for it none the less). So, at about $9 for 4 ml; if this were gasoline it would cost over $170K to fill a 20 gal tank! The other guys were selling 2 ml for the same price so thankfully my car doesn't run on this stuff.But not using it can spend about $200 to $20,000 (Intel Xeon and AMD Epyc CPU builds can start touching this magnitude of cash) in less than a minute. So far, I have stressed my system during video rendering and compositing on a few occasions - it's ok, that's what it was built to do. The CPU is factory rated at 90 degrees C - that's almost hot enough to boil water, but that is the factory established LIMIT. Using this paste along with a liquid-cooled thermal management scheme, my CPU has never gone above 61C during any operation to date including the most stressful. The thermal paste is the transmitter between the CPU and the heatsink. So no cooling strategy will be any more efficient than the paste will allow.Another reason for purchasing a tube with extra paste; some builds use more than one CPU, and sometimes there's an options to provide additional cooling to the GPU. M.2 memory tends to run pretty warm and use heatsinks as well. The point being, anytime there's a heatsink, using thermal paste at the junction will enhance the heatsink's ability to cool the component - the better the paste, the more efficient the cooling. And cooler components run faster and smoother. Solid State memory slows down significantly at higher temperatures, it's called throttling for anyone looking at their first build. So I probably used less than 1 ml to install the CPU - it's more art than exact science, but having more left over is helpful if one has numerous heatsinks to treat during the build.This paste emerged from the tube in a predictable manner - which is good considering the cost per ounce. It came with a mini-spatula for spreading. It sort of resembles a pizza peel if one were providing their pet hamster with its own pizza oven, but I digress. Spreading the paste prior to installing the CPU cooler was very easy and controllable. I was able to achieve edge to edge over the CPU without any dripping to the motherboard - nice, neat, mess-free application. There's also a rating for noise level....ok....um...this paste is pretty quiet. (Amazon asks reviewers to rate a few areas that are not necessarily presented in the public review space other than as an aggregate score).My CPU was at 24C (room temperature) when I powered up this afternoon. It is now at 37C and hasn't gone above 43C during this session. That was probably during Windows boot up. It runs typically between 34C and 38C during low demand. I have read some reviews in which folks describe their systems as running nominally ay 70C! (Methinks these are gaming rigs under full load). So, I guess based on all of this, this paste is pretty effective. But it can only be as effective as the rest of the cooling system it supports. At least I can confidently say that it is not likely to be a weak link - and it has a rating for efficacy over 8 years! I would purchase it again - but I wouldn't fill the gas tank with it.",

So I figured that it might need a repaste after 3 years of using. Opened up the laptop and found out that factory thermal paste was not spread properly. Half of the cpu was not covered by factory thermal paste and some other chips on the side had some uneven spread. Alot of the paste was on the board itself rather then being on the cpu and other chips. So i did a complete repaste and covered everything properly. It made a huge frickin difference in cooling temperatures. Even at heavy usage the temperature never went above 70C. And the games actually stopped crashing. Hell of a difference it made there. I\u2019m glad I purchased this paste. I had read about this paste already. So just went for it straight. Really happy and satisfied with it. Does an Awesome job. Now my laptop Probably be good for another 3-4 years.",

Questo significa che garantisce una buona trasmissione del calore tra il processore o la scheda video e il dissipatore, contribuendo a mantenere le temperature sotto controllo.In secondo luogo, la MX-4 \u00e8 facile da applicare. Basta seguire la semplice tecnica del \"chicco di riso\" per ottenere una distribuzione uniforme e omogenea. Sul sito ufficiale ci sono anche video tutorial.Infine, la MX-4 \u00e8 dichiarata durevole. Ovviamente questo al momento non lo posso verificare, ma dalle recensioni online sembra essere cos\u00ec.Io ho utilizzato la MX-4 sul mio computer prima con un Ryzen 7 2700x e dissipatore stock AMD e successivamente su un i5 13600k e dissipatore Noctua.Nel primo caso rispetto alla pasta termica di serie notato una piccola riduzione delle temperatura.Questo significa che il processore pu\u00f2 funzionare a una frequenza maggiore per periodi di tempo pi\u00f9 lunghi, senza rischiare di surriscaldarsi.In conclusione, la Arctic MX-4 \u00e8 una pasta termica ottima per chi vuole ottenere le migliori prestazioni dal proprio computer. \u00c8 facile da applicare, ha una buona conducibilit\u00e0 termica.Se state cercando una nuova pasta termica, vi consiglio di prenderla in considerazione.",
