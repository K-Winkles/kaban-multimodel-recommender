                "reviewText": "Good little computer for $150.I bought this to mess around with Windows 10. Win 7 Pro (it comes already installed with that) upgrades to 10 Pro for free, so you're almost getting a PC for free (if you're willing to play around for an afternoon upgrading it).Inside, I found the machine clean and easy to work on. It appears to be mini-ITX, with a nice straight-through cooler and a small power supply with a large quiet fan. Very quiet. Good chassis and it requires no tools to open. Everything folds out of the way and the cables are nicely packaged. Extra space for a second 3.5\" drive, and you could throw out the now-obsolete DVD drive if you needed more.USB is 2.0. I've ordered a 1/2 height USB 3.0 card to fix that. (important to get 1/2 height cards, this chassis doesn't hold full height PCI cards)The hard drive is old and slow. Mine was dated 2010 (currently mid 2015). So if you don't plan on upgrading that, back up often (as one should). Hard drives typically have an MTBF of 3 to 5 years, and you can bet any of these refurb machines were powered up most of the time in a big office somewhere. So the drive is on borrowed time.There are 4 full sized DIMM slots, all occupied by 1GB sticks of PC3-10600/DDR3 1333. That's not bad, and you can buy 4GB sticks for just over $20 right now. You could have a pretty decent machine with 16GB and an SSD for all the money you save over buying new.An SSD was what I chose to add first, given the sketchy hard drive it comes with. And a small SSD is money well spent in this case. No more waiting hours for windows updates to apply. And I still have room for a conventional drive.The machine came with a cheap keyboard and mouse, both new. I didn't try them, but they will make fine spares.This is a good deal for an easily upgraded PC for office or student use. It's no powerhouse by any means, but it runs Windows fine, and will have a third life in a few years running linux when it can't.",

                "reviewText": "Good quality Intel dual core processor computer. . Comes with Windows 7 operating system. We have Xfinity and the computer has good speed. No CD burner or player. For me, no problem. With Echo, Kindle Fire and my phone, I can store and play my music on those devices. I rarely use CD's and have no need to download to MP3. It has DVD. It arrived well packaged and protected. Looks like new. No scratches or dents. It comes with a good quality wireless keyboard and a wired mouse. My HP monitor, speaker and printer are compatible. It's a slim line design...about 12\"by 15\". I like that is smaller and compact. Takes up very little room under my computer desk. It comes with registration numbers and instructions for back up. It was easy to get it up and running.Our computer went kaput on day without any warning. It just died. Our previous computer was a customized 15 year old HP. It was expensive and while we got our money's worth, we rarely used most of the custom features. It was state of the art when purchased, but didn't take long to become obsolete. Not that that mattered. We used the computer to surf the net, shop Amazon, watch a few movies and play a few games. This time around I wasn't going to spend a lot of money.This is perfect for us. I really like this computer and love the pricetag. I upgraded to Windows 10. It was free. That free upgrade from Windows has expired. It will cost to upgrade now. Still, if you just use the computer for basic stuff and don't want to upgrade, this Windows 7 will well do the job at a great price.",

                "reviewText": "I don't know much about computers, so this won't be a \"technical\" review... BUT, I've been working on an older than dirt computer that finally couldn't be upgraded in memory, operating system, software... everything. And my goodness was it slow! I live in the sticks, so our internet service that's available is already slow as it is... BUT, this computer, when it came was not only easy to set up (just follow the directions that come with it), but it is fast, for me. I'm a simple person, and I've learned to deal with a slow load, but this is a click and you're there kinda machine. I love it. Plenty of room is included, and inside there is room for more memory sticks (RAM?) according to my husband. If he is pleased with it, then I know I did something right. We need to replace another computer soon, and he wants the same one! All in all, I love it.",
