                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Good CPU Cooler. Two minor cons, both relate to the fan.",
                "reviewText": "This comes in a nice looking box packed in closed cell foam, which is the foam that offers good protection to computer components. Inside the box is the CPU cooler (heat sink), fan, various mounting parts, instructions, a small tube of thermal paste, and two clips to attach the fan to the heat sink.This is a well made cooler. It has four copper heat pipes that provide good coverage of the CPU where it comes into contact with it. Everything is black which gives it a great \"stealthy\" look. The fan is PWM (Pulse Width Modulation, allows your fan speed to be controlled by the motherboard based on the CPU temperature), and attaches easily by the included clips.Now, this is where the two minor cons come in. I am not taking points off for this, but I need to mention them. First, this CPU cooler is able to use two fans, not just one, in a push/pull setup, which would increase cooling more than using one fan. In order to do this, you need two sets of clips, one for each fan, to attach both fans to the cooler/heat sink. They only included one set of clips, not two. These clips generally are not included when you purchase additional fans. If you wanted to use two fans, as many of us would, you either have to request an extra set of clips from PCCOOLER, or buy them yourself. While not horrible, it does add extra cost unless they are willing to send you a pair. It just would have been nice if they included four clips instead of two.Second minor con that I noticed, is that the included fan has rubber dampeners on four corners to reduce vibration and noise, but only on one side. Luckily it is the side you would want them on if your only using one fan. However, if you ever want to use the fan anywhere else, it would have been nice if the dampeners were on both sides. It may be possible to move the dampeners from one side to the other in this case. To me it looks like it is. Still, I personally would have liked the dampeners on both sides in every corner.Those minor cons aside, it is still a good CPU cooler, and something I would/will be using on mid range Ryzen CPU's (Like the 7600, etc). Should also work for Intel i5's but those CPU's (13600/14600) boost up to the 180w range and that is getting close to the TDP (Thermal Design Power) of this cooler. Despite the minor cons, at its current price, it is a downright bargain and excellent value!",

                "reviewText": "In 25+ years of PC building, this is my first time ever using an aftermarket CPU cooler. I always thought the boxed coolers were \"good enough\"; and they are. But if you want cooler temps and boosting headroom, an aftermarket cooler will do the trick. This was a piece of cake to install, though the directions don't make it super clear with bushing you should use (there are three sets of different colors, would be helpful if the instructions pointed out which color you should be using for which CPUs).After booting up, I ran Prime 95 against my Ryzen 5600 for about 10 minutes and my temps peaked around 65C, which I consider excellent. The processor sustained all core boost over 4.0-4.1 GHz the entire time. This is a vast improvement from my previous setup: a Ryzen 2600 with a Wraith Spire cooler which would hover around 85C.The fan is very quiet; silent at idle, and surprisingly quiet when under load.I prefer the design of this over some of the other coolers on the market, like the Thermalright Assassin or Cooler Master Hyper 212. I don't need spikes on the top of my cooler.The question is, should you buy this over the \"big brands\"? CPU coolers aren't particularly expensive, and many of the name brands are around the same price. My worry is parts availability in the future. Will I be able to get a bracket the fits the next Intel socket, for instance? Who knows. I've never heard of PCCOOLER. Will they even be around? Unclear. At this price it probably doesn't matter.",

There are also a few other available from some other makers. They all have this same basic look and design and are the new \"it\" cooler for fantastic price to performance ratio.I picked this up for a 13500 system. It will have no problems cooling this as I've tested this exact same form factor from an i3-12100f all the way up to a 7800X3D and it was able to handle all of them even allowing the 7800X3D to boost up to ~4700 all core testing with CB23. For gaming it is lights out.Installation is very easy and all you need to do is plug the fan right into the CPU fan header and you're done. It is very lightweight.With the way the fan uses removable retention clips, you can easily swap in any fan of your choice for slightly better cooling if needed, but the stock fans are more than enough. You can also swap in any RGB/aRGB fan as long as your motherboard supports it or go for a quieter fan if needed.I love the all black look with no silver or white disrupting the look. This is perfect for a blackout build.The best part? This is currently $18USD which is just a fantastic price for a cooler that will handle a wide array of CPUs no problem.",
