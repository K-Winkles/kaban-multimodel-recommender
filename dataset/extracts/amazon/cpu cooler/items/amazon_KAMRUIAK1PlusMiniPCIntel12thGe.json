                "reviewText": "I needed a PC for the bedroom to watch videos on YouTube and from my server at night. I use wireless headphones for normal TV so my wife can sleep without bothering her.This Kamrui works perfectly for this use. The processor is plenty fast and the 8GB RAM is sufficient for watching videos and surfing the internet. While getting it set up, I loaded a couple games on it, and they ran reasonably well at their minimum settings, but I wouldn't want to use this as a real gaming PC. I also got a wireless motion remote to control the mouse and I use the Windows built-in graphic keyboard. The setup works very well.My only complaint is the fan is very loud. My wife said it woke her up when it cycled on and off. Now I have been building my own PCs for many years, so I took it apart to see what I could do about it. The first thing I tried was to disconnect the CPU fan connector in order to try a different fan. Unfortunately the connector tore off motherboard despite holding it down with needle-nose pliers. Now I have probably done this 100+ times with other PCs and never experienced this problem. I was really unhappy that this happened (obviously poor quality soldering) and thought I was stuck with an unusable PC. I thought I would try to make the best of it and see what would happen without a fan at all. To my pleasant surprise, it works very well. Under normal use, like watching videos, the core temperature is 60-70C, which is perfectly fine. Even running CPU stress programs like Prime95 it holds at 80C, although you sometimes see thermal throttling being activated. I urge anyone else who is experienced with building and taking apart PCs to disconnect the fan, if they find the fan noise objectionable.With my \"fix\", I am totally happy with this product and it has very good value for the money.",

                "reviewText": "I got this a couple weeks ago and have been playing with it since. I have to admit, I really love this Mini PC trend. It's powerful and quiet and does everything a bigger system can do.Unboxing the system was simple. All the components were inside and felt secure. It came with the computer, a power cable, HDMI cable, instructions, and screws with a small mounting bracket (e.g. to attach it to a monitor). When it's powered on, it has a nice blue glow, which makes my desk look really mystical in the dark, or has just enough light to let me know it's on.It has a decent amount of ports - two HMDI, which can support 4k monitors (mine are only 1080p), two USB3 ports, two USB2 ports, a wired network port, and a combined microphone/speaker port. One thing I love is how the main body splits - you can put a laptop hard drive in it for extra storage, like large video or game files, or use it slim.It comes with Windows 11 pro, which is ready out of the box. Edge and Chrome ran without complaining, serving up any web page I could find. I wanted to see if this system could handle Linux, so I put Ubuntu on it, and I think it runs even better than Windows, although I'm going to stick with Windows for casual gaming purposes.I can see this being useful for a home office or basic gaming, and at the price, it feels perfect for a holiday gift... but I'm keeping this for myself. Get your own.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is a wonderful little PC! I've used mini PCs in the past and this is a complete all in one PC. I love that it has the latest version of windows 11 PRO running smoothly. Super quiet. It came with a large 256GB m.2 SSD (very fast) which is way better than HDD and I'll never go back. This leaves room for your 2.5\u201d SSD whenever you need more space. No SD card slot on this one but easy to use a USB adapter for that.I wouldn't plan on using it for heavy video, but general use is excellent. I like to dual boot into retro gaming from a USB stick and it runs Batocera great as well. Supports high resolutions with jaw dropping images on my monitor. Compared to a big PC tower, this thing is amazing for the size. I really like the top ventilation as well. I plan to tuck it onto a shelf and have no concern for over heating. This is a good PC if you're looking to tinker with Windows and BIOS settings...a great machine to learn on.There are many options out there but this form factor is clearly well designed and updated. I recommend this one for your mini PC needs.",
