                "reviewText": "My AIO H100i went bad for my 2011 LGA Asus Rampage IV Black edition so I ordered this to replace it. Installation was really easy in my opinion. I did need to remove the processor completely (to provide room for one of the spacers) and I realized that the backplate provided isn't needed for this CPU type as it has its own that works. Instructions were accurate and easy to read; just pay attention to the orientation of everything. Bags were also labeled with the CPU type which was helpful.CPU temp is honestly better than it was with the radiator. I'm running a cool 30 C right now with my i7 4930K.One thing, if you get the RGB, be sure your mobo has a ARGB 5v 3pin port; otherwise you can't hook up the light. But, at least the lights are optional so I just left that part unplugged.",

Make sure you dig out your old plastic clip mounting hardware that came with the mother board. lucky i didn't throw mine away. Beware its a very tight fit onto the motherboard. so if you aren't comfortable using a little bit of force then i wouldn't recommend this cooler for you. I also forgot to mention i took my motherboard out of my case to install. It would of been way harder if i would have left it in the case(Zalman S2 ATX Mid Tower).",

                "reviewText": "Original review: This cooler looks unique and does a decent job of cooling my R5 1600X. I can run 3.8Ghz on all cores and average around 75C with an aggressive fan curve during a synthetic stress test. It both looks and sounds like a turbine engine when it spins up. If you keep fans below 50% the noise is negligible. This is a tall cooler. I would not recommend it for SFF builds. There are probably better performing coolers for the price, but I'm paying for the somewhat unique look, and I'm okay with that.Update: Be mindful of the height of this cooler, it is too tall for most of the really cheap Mid-Towers like DIYPC S2-BK or the ones common on Ali. It fits snugly in a Dell Optiplex 3020 M/T.The cooler also performs well with my R7 2700. I run 4.2 Ghz at ~1.3V on all cores comfortably.",
