                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars 13900ks is a beast!",
                "reviewText": "Previously I had the AMD 7950x and it was pretty fast, don\u2019t get me wrong. However, this 13900ks is a lot snappier even browsing around in windows 11. Programs launch faster and games are buttery smooth @ 4k ultra details, when paired with an Nvidia 4090. I also love the fact that the ks is a \u201cbinned\u201d CPU, which overclocks more easily and typically handles faster DDR5 memory in the range of 7800-8400Mhz depending on how good the memory controller is in your 13900ks sample. Regardless, you will probably be able to hit 7800-8000 at the least. This purchase is actually my 2nd 13900ks and I ended up getting a better binned version this time. With an overal(Asus) SP of 113, P Cores 123, e cores 93, and memory controller was 83. Im currently running a G.Skill 32GB(2x16GB) 7800mhz DDR5 kit with XMP turned on in the BIOS. I have been able to bump it up to a stable 8000mhz by bumping up the Memory Controller voltage to 1.4v and the VDD/VDDQ voltage to 1.5v using the same timings that were on my 7800 XMP kit CL36. With the CPU and a Corsair h170i 420mm AIO with 6 fans in a push pull configuration, I was able to get a stable CPU overclock of 60/60/58/58/58/58/58/58 on the (8) P cores, but I\u2019m pretty sure I can bump the 1-3 core workloads higher. It\u2019s when using a workload that requires all 8 P cores that I run into some stability issues with my current cooling trying to push it past 5.8Ghz using all 8 p cores. I leave my E cores all synced at 4.3Ghz stock to help give me more P core Overclock headroom. Another overclock method that works really well, is easy and stable, is to turn on the Asus AiOverclock. Given that I have used both an MSI and Asus Z790 motherboard, I highly recommend the Asus ROG brand line for a Z790 compatible motherboard for this 13900ks. They update their BIOS version frequently and there quality is typically very good on there products that are produced in higher numbers. The absolute ideal motherboard for Overclocking and using the fastest DDR5 ram would be the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 APEX(2-DIMM) motherboard. If you just can\u2019t get your hands on one maybe go with the (4-DIMM) Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Hero motherboard. You should be able to reach up to 7600mhz DDR5 on it. Whatever you do don\u2019t settle on a motherboard, because it\u2019s the center of the system and can be upgraded later. I started with an MSI Meg Z790 Ace and wish I had started with an Asus. The MSI ran a lot hotter with the same clock speeds and only supported up to 7200mhz DDR5 using 2x16GB sticks. The motherboard attached in the review photo is the Asus ROG Maximus Z790 APEX, a thermal Grizzly 12/13th gen contact frame to make the cpu more level for the heatsink cooler that goes on top and of course the 13900ks that\u2019s a little dirty from previously applied thermal paste I just wiped off. Sorry for the long winded review, but this has been my favorite CPU that I\u2019ve owned. It\u2019s super fast and you can tinker with it for an easy overclock for fun.",

                "reviewText": "Works just fine, really fast, lots of cores. With all the cores running, they will run up to 100 C and throttle back on clock speed with pretty much any standard CPU cooler. The consensus seems to be that this is limited by the thermal connection inside the CPU case between the actual chip and the upper surface which contacts your cooling block. In other words, the cores can overheat even if your cooling system can maintain the upper surface of the CPU at room temperature. You don't want the cores running hot at 99 C for any length of time, and so you really need to tune the CPU clock speed and the voltages with a motherboard that permits overclock tuning. With a good standard CPU cooler, I found it's possible to run continuously with a 4.7 GHz clock on all 24 cores and keep the core temperatures below 85 C.",

Weather they are accurate or not I can't say as I am not into this hobby like that. What I can say is this, I have noticed a massive difference. Especially when running cinebench or 3D Mark. I paired this with Strix 4090 OC, Strix Z790-E and a crucial T700 Gen 5 SSD and the performance is amazing.",
