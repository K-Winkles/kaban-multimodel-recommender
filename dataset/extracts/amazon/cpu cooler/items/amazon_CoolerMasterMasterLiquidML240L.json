                "reviewText": "Update - (last 3 pics added) - I Frankensteined my PC case and move the radiator to the front of my case. I believe that has dropped the CPU temperature by 4 degrees on average. I moved the radiator in support of my new Aorus X570 Pro WIFI, but I think I would have had room for it after all. But, I am glad I move the radiator.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(I hope you can see the pictures ok)I have added some before and after pictures. I am hoping you can get a feel for the space I had available for the radiator (not much in this case ((Rosewill TYRFING ATX Mid Tower Gaming Computer Case)).PC:1. Ryzen 5 3600X2. B450 Tomahawk <- Gigabyte Aorus X570 Pro WIFI ** edited **3. Vega 564. DDR4 16 GB running at 3200 mhz5. 650 watt PSU6. 512 GB M.3 (PCIe) - (I also have an HDD 3TP)7. My first build - I know that the 3600 would have been as good, but I should have gotten the 3700X (oh well)I will give you my pros and cons. I am not going to hold the size of my case against the AIO.PROS:1. Everything fit well in my case. I did spend a half hour getting all the wire pointed in the correct direction (you will see why that is important) - I would suggest you do the same.2. It seems to keep the CPU pretty cool. Cinebench 20 drives the temperature up to the mid-70's, which is way better than the3. It took less than 30 minutes to install and test. I spent a couple hours with my BIOS getting the cooling/noise ratio where I want it.4. I was glad there was just about the perfect amount of tubing. Any more and I would have been tucking tubing in places I did not need it.5. I really like the way it looks, and the Cooler Master label showing. It is not close to an open loop, but better than in fan I have seen.6. I think the price I paid was really reasonable.CONS:1. I was expecting the system to be cooler. I do want to run overclocking, and for now, I have focused on my Vega 56 (great card to work with). Mind you, my system does not go above 80 degrees, but I have never seen the low temps people talk about.2. The included thermal paste as a let down. Cooler Master makes some really good thermal paste, but that was not included.3. I tried to use Cabonaut with no luck. I could not keep the the pad positioned and I tore the pad during the installation (oh well - not sure I can really blame Cooler Master for that).4. I have my system cranked up pretty high, so it is pretty noisy. I run the pump 100% of the time. I cant think of any good reason not to run the pump (I have run the pumps in my aquariums for 15 years straight without an issue and I dont see much difference).I dont have the best looking system by far, but I am proud of it. My AIO is a major reason for my pride.I hope this information helps.",

                "reviewText": "Don't subscribe to the notion that everything inside a case has to look like an 80's Disco, and the inline \" controller \" is nothing beyond the choice of primary colors. Woefully inadequate. But the main thing should be the function, and it is quiet and seems to do a good job. Not sure if the slightly higher temps ( 2-3 deg c ) I am seeing over a 2015 version of the same cooler has to do with a pump redesign, or the carbon pad heatsink. But overall is it the same dependable CM quality I am used to. Just glad to have figure out how to turn the light show off. Hope it lasts as long as the one it is replacing.",
