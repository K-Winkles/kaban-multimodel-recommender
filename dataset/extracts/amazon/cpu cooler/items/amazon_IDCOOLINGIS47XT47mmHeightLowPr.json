                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent quality with a lot of potential!",
                "reviewText": "The small form factor space has had some exciting cases that have come to market over the last few years. Some of those cases are really small -- I'm talking about the ones that are less than 10 liters in volume. Many of these have severe height limitations on the CPU cooler. This cooler compares nicely to other more expensive small CPU coolers, like the NH-L9i in terms of the way its made. I can't personally comment on how they stack up, but they are very similar in design. I chose to roll the dice on this newcomer, and it definitely performs.First, let's get out of the way who this cooler is made for. You would not try to cool an enthusiast or flagship CPU with this cooler. That means if you're thinking of an i7, i9, Ryzen 7, etc. -- This isn't for you. Those CPUs use way too much power, and as a result, they generate more heat. This cooler really shines on i3 and some i5 applications, because the peak power consumption can be low enough, that this little guy can dissipate the heat effectively. Don't just look at rated TDP either, compare CPU cooler TDP with actual peak power consumption.My travel rig currently has an i5 12400 riding in a Z690i AORUS ULTRA PLUS, and the IS-47-XT does a great job with that. With 3dMark benchmarks, on stock power settings, I only reach temperatures in the high 60s (Celsius). Gaming loads are typically a little lower. The noise levels are very reasonable with my current CPU and case setup.I opted to swap the included non-RGB fan for a 12v RGB fan from Scythe. It works great but you have to carefully screw it down as the screws go deeper into the fan and will push into the heat sink fin stack a little. I've tried both the 15mm and 25mm thick versions from Scythe and there's little difference in performance. I did seem to notice a little less noise and turbulence from the 25mm fan, but that might just be due to that fan resting against the mesh side panel of my case, effectively sealing it off. I had to get creative with finding screws to hold the 25mm thick Scythe fan, but I'm a builder and I have tons of that stuff on hand. Either way, both size fans work well on the heat sink.This cooler should fit in most, if not all, modern ITX boards between the RAM and VRM/NVMe heat sinks. One huge plus about this cooler is that it doesn't need to cover the RAM. ID-Cooling makes the IS-55-XT, which is a little larger, and can effectively cool slightly beefier CPUs. The compromise with that one is the increased height, and it will either need to cover the RAM or VRM heat sink. This limits you to non-RGB low profile memory if your VRM heat sink is chunky like the one on my board. Your case also may or may not fit the IS-55-XTI'm waiting for my i5 12600K to arrive, and I plan to try to tune it enough to tame operating temps enough for it to be my new CPU in this rig. I'll update my review once I have my final findings.If you have realistic expectations, this CPU cooler checks a lot of boxes, and at a total height of 47mm, it fits in a lot of cases.",

                "reviewText": "In all honesty, I wanted to get a new LP cooler that can replace the intel stock cooler in my Optiplex size case because I absolutely hate mounting the intel stock cooler.I didn\u2019t want to spend much so I chose this cooler as it had clearance for the case.For $35, the cooler had some solid weight and quality to it. It didn\u2019t feel cheap as compared to the Intel stock cooler. Mounting it was easy but had a little trouble getting my screwdriver through the fans to get to the mounting screwsWhen I first boot the PC, I was concerned about not hearing any fan noise when it was booting. However it was actually a very quiet cooler! Compared to the intel stock cooler, it was nearly dead silent! When gaming in this 9L case, it was hovering around the mid 50s compared to the mid 60s from the stock cooler!If you are looking for a budget low profile cooler for an i5 or Ryzen 5 chip, this is definitely the cooler for you. A 65w i7 or Ryzen 7 can work as well but just be aware anything about 90W may have some overheating issues!",

                "reviewText": "I bought 2 of theses 1 for my ITX system that runs PFsence with a Ryzen Pro 2400G. Has the stock stealth cooler I was getting like 96F I added this cooler with some Thermal Gizzly Hydronaut I went from 96F to 91-92 in Standard Fan speed in the bios. The Second one is in my Plex Server with a Ryzen 3600. 32-36.6C in idle under load encoding multiple streams I see 39- 42. I have these running 24/7 on both systems I don't hear the fan. These are cheaper than the be quite LP and the Noctua NH-L9a. the heat sink has 1 extra heat pipe over the Pro Rock LP and it had double the pipes on the Noctua. I wouldn't put ANYTHING over 65Watts on this cooler.",

                "reviewText": "It's a somewhat decent cooler, however it really struggles to keep the i9 10850k under 43c, under basic load temps spike upward of 80c. I've tried multiple thermal pastes at this point. I have also a different back bracket to get it tightened even tighter to the chip and same result. I decided to switch it out to a noctua low profile one and that keeps the temps around 30c to 33c at idle. Keep in mind I run all the fans maxed out in my PC running at the fullest speed. I mean this cheap CPU cooler does somewhat an okay job but maybe look for another option if you are using an i9 or i7.",
