At a height of only 37mm, the NH-L9a is ideal for extremely slim cases and, due to its small footprint, it provides 100% RAM and PCIe compatibility as well as easy access to near-socket connectors even on tightly packed mini-ITX motherboards. The custom-designed SecuFirm2 mounting system for the AM5 socket makes installation a breeze and, thanks to the highly optimised NF-A9x14 92mm fan that supports fully automatic speed control via PWM, the NH-L9a-AM5 runs remarkably quietly. Topped off with Noctua\u2019s renowned NT-H1 thermal compound, the NH-L9a-AM5 combines everything users have come to expect from Noctua\u2019s larger coolers into a super-compact, premium-quality package for ITX and HTPC builds with AMD AM5 processors.",

This means that neither the heatsink nor the fan overhang the RAM, so the cooler provides easy access to the slots and is fully compatible with tall memory modules. 100% compatibility with PCIe cards Some AMD-based mini-ITX motherboards have the PCIe slot located close to the CPU socket zone. While larger coolers that exceed this zone may block the PCIe slot, the compact-sized NH-L9a-AM5 provides full compatibility with PCIe cards. NF-A9x14 PWM premium fan The highly optimised, award-winning NF-A9x14 premium fan features Noctua's proprietary AAO frame as well as sophisticated aerodynamic design measures. Supporting PWM for fully automatic speed control, the NF-A9x14 allows the NH-L9a to stay remarkably quiet.",

The installation process however, was a pain and took me at least 30-40 minutes to mount the tiny screws to the mounting hole. The provided screws made things increasingly difficult and at times messy as you have thermal paste and your looking around trying to line up the tiny screws in order to mount. I was able to get it to fit on properly, but was a tedious process.",
