                "reviewText": "Even though my 3-person family does just about everything on either a laptop or smartphone, we still have a desktop office computer for those things that you would do while sitting at a desk. We don't use it for gaming, just simple word processing/presentation creation and Internet browsing. The one we had was dying; looooong load times indicated that either the motherboard or (more likely) the hard drive was reaching the end of its life (10 year old computer). I considered a new, high speed desktop with a separate graphics card and all the bells and whistles, but I already have a laptop for that. All I needed was a basic computer, so that's what I bought.This computer arrived on time, and it was nicely packaged to ensure it didn't get damaged in transit. I don't know how old this computer is, but the condition of the case looked brand new. I removed the cover to look at the guts, and there were no signs of any dust or previous use. Don't panic if you don't see a power cord. The cord is in the nicely packaged keyboard box, along with the keyboard (duh!) and a wireless dongle. Lots of USB ports on this baby (10!), but it also has a few legacy ports like serial, PS/2, and VGA.Set-up was easy. If you've never had a computer with a SSD hard drive, you will be amazed at how fast it is. Remember, this isn't a gaming computer, but it still boots and loads much faster than a \"traditional\" computer. The refurb company didn't load any bloatware on the computer, just good ole Windows 10. The only prompt to purchase anything additional was the expected Office 365 prompts.So far, (this is day 3) this little computer is doing exactly what I purchased it for. For that reason, it gets a 5 due to 1) cost, 2) appearance, 3) no bloatware, and 4) operates as expected.",

                "reviewText": "Works perfectly. Super fast. Set up is exactly like a new pc. Tower is spotlessly clean. You can not tell it has ever been used before. I've loaded 300+ cd's into it and synced them to my cars device with ease via windows media player which is the newest version an already installed. I buy a lot of motorcycle parts and shop Amazon/ebay having many windows open at a time. Nothing slows this unit down. For the price it is impossible to beat. I did have to buy a DisplayPort to HDMI cable for a higher end monitor. But that was just a plug and play situation. Cable was 12$ on.....you guessed it, Amazon. Clarity and definition is unbelievable. Refurbished Dell gets an absolute 5 stars. Thanks, Mike",

                "reviewText": "I have to confess, my expectations of a $280 refurb Win10PC were not all that high. I knew the Optiplex series were built for a business environment with better components than a consumer machine. The computer arrived in a single box cradled in foam spacers and wrapped in a recycled plastic bag. The supplied keyboard and mouse were cheap, but I already had better on hand. Note...this machine has VGA and Dual Displayport outputs, so there was a bit of digging to find a DP to DVI cable in my stocks. Initial boot from the 500GB SSD was fast and smooth, as was setup. The Windows 10PRO activation went without a hitch, something you can be burned on if you go too cheap from a reseller. There was a very minor ding in the plastic face of the DVD drive. This model has a generous layout of USB ports, with both 2.0 and 3.0 front and back. The supplied Wi-Fi dongle is VERY flimsy, I had a bad moment when it came apart on me while I was changing USB ports. However once I snapped it back together and seated it, all was well. The primary use for this machine was for my Amateur Radio operations, and it serves the purpose. The 16GB of RAM lets me have several applications running at once. This is not a game machine, and the small form factor and power supply won't fit a fancy GPU, but performance wise, the quad core i5 is up to most tasks and videos run smoothly. It was nice to find a old school serial DB9 port on the back when a lot of old ham radio gear uses that connection still. All in all, considering the cost of a new 10Pro License, this workhorse PC gives solid bang for the buck when you don't need latest/greatest. As a bonus it's nearly silent operating and has a minimal footprint while not feeling cramped when plugging in externals.",

                "reviewText": "It's only been two days, but so-far-so-good!We needed an inexpensive desktop computer pre-loaded with Windows for my wife to use. Basically for email, surfing, playing simple games (solitaire) and shopping. Not demeaning my wife, it's just what she uses her computer for. This one was a good price. I've been a computer programmer for years and I know that I didn't need a brand new, top of the line, super-fast, computer for what this one's purpose would be, so I went with a refurbished one.I did not need new monitors, which led to my only problem. My existing monitor cables were DVI style and this pc tower has ports for HDMI and VGA cables. A quick trip to Wally-World for VGA cables and I was good to go. This unit also had an extra slot and connectors for a second hard-drive, which I used to attach the hard-drive from our old computer. This made it easy to transfer pics and files from the old drive to the new one.As stated, it's only been a couple of days, but it's working as it should.Fingers crossed and two-thumbs up.",
