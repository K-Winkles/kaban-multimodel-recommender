The top bracket secures snuggly to the underside of my desk, while the rest hangs below, out of my way and OFF OF THE GROUND!! It does allow the CPU to swivel around, but not in my setup since the legs of my desk are too close together. I'm not sure why I would want it to swivel anyways. The overall construction is super solid with nicely welded joints. I have high confidence in it lasting for years and years. Besides making my desk area look a lot better, it also helps by keeping the computer out of the way when it's time to vacuum. This is an excellent computer holder. In am well pleased.",

                "reviewText": "IMMEDIATE WARNING- be careful which desktop you use- it needs a solid core- I used a certain Swedish meatball restaurant that sells furniture tabletop and the screws began to rip out of the hollow core. You can solve this problem by gluing a \u00bc in piece of wood to the location and screwing into it. I have another issue with the design unfortunately- the top holder piece screw pokes thru and will scrape the top of your desktop if you don\u2019t put a felt pad there. Curiously my kit did not come with instructions, please note the pictures on the listing or my review if you need assistance. If you use the included wood screws for the mount- you are going to be much more limited on weight tolerance than I think you need to- they were only about 1/4in wood screws- I'd recommend a 1in thick desktop with half in screws for much higher weight tolerances (IE a gamer rig).Aside from these negatives, the piece is as solid as your desk that is holding it. I think it is a convenient way of mounting the PC. I opted to use the top screw holes but it is worth noting you can also side (or wall) mount the unit. In either case I'd consider weight limits, if you are mounting an extremely top end graphics card and power supply in a larger case, you may need to use a more solid mounting option than the included screws- at that point I'd consider pass thru bolts and nuts and sink the screws flush.It's imperfect out of box, but a little bit of work makes it useful mount- get the felt pad, and make sure your mounting is solid enough to hold the weight- which probably means opting for bigger screws than the included quarter in wood screws.",

Might be nice if they added a securing screw to stop it from rotating around the center pole, but as it's near the legs of my desk it doesn't matter for my setup. Overall would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for the alfd suoke Ergonomic CPU Holder Under Desk Mount.I ordered this to hold my PC tower under my mobile workstation setup.The build quality is ok. The weight bearing components are metal while the two sleeve parts that slide onto the arm are made of plastic.On my unit, the paint or finish on the base part has some kind of stain or to much paint. I didn't bother to do anything about it because it was going to be covered by my computer and it didn't affect functionality.The top sleeve with the width adjustment bracket does not have a locking bolt for the height. If you try to remove your computer, you'll have to hold the bracket up or loosen it and swing the bracket out of the way, otherwise it will just drop down.In the product installation video, it shows four screws for the top mount. My unit only has 3 screws/holes at the top. It did not affect the support of my PC but may affect heavier computers or \"gaming\" computers. As a side note, you will have to watch the video for assembly because there were no instructions included.For reference, I have a standard mid tower (attached pictures) with a standard ATX motherboard, CPU, regular air cooler, and power supply. No hard drives, glass panels, or water cooling, so my PC is fairly light weight.Installation and assembly is easy. Just make sure you visualize and plan for your tower computer and the space it takes up. I did use an impact driver for the screws.In my installation, my tower gets in the way of leg room so I may have to use a smaller build.In summary I did not encounter any major issues with the product itself and the alfd suoke Ergonomic CPU Holder does the job if you have a standard mid-tower computer tower or smaller, and would like to relocate the tower under your desk but off the ground. I would highly recommend it for a workstation style desk setup or rising desk because the computer will move with the desk and you don't have to worry about cable lengths.I did deduct a star because it did not include basic printed instructions.",
