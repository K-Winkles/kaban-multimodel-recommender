                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Extreme cooling and quality at its finest, I was thoroughly impressed!",
                "reviewText": "When building a PC your budget can get out of control fast, and one area it can be tempting to cut back is on the CPU cooler. Certainly, a premium model can't make that much of a difference, can it? Well, I'm here to tell you that it certainly CAN, and when you think about, the CPU is probably the most expensive part in your whole build- it deserves the best protection you can give it!This is BIG and HEAVY and made of the most solid, impressive metal I have seen. There is no cheap aluminum that bends when you press on the grills, or tiny screw threads that strip and flake here, this is tough like a TANK! The CPU contact face is solid copper, not just striped copper where the cooling pipes cross over it. The thick adjustable back plate locks down onto the CPU's own metal backing firmly and pulls additional heat off of the back, which is a lot more powerful than a stock fan with pegs that pinch in from above and offer nothing extra for the back of the processor. What really stands out for me is that once the cooler is on, you can remove the actual heat sink and access the CPU socket for upgrades later on WITHOUT having to flip your case over and remove the back plate! Just unscrew the two screws that hold the heat sink onto the mounting poles, take them off, and the CPU socket/tray is right there, unobstructed, for a quick upgrade that doesn't require removing the back plate or possibly having to take out the entire motherboard to get to it! I absolutely LOVE that!The included dual fans link together for using the same socket, and they were very quiet, but also able to ramp up high when pushed to do so. Even at the highest I could push them, though, I never felt that they added any more noise than the fans in the case itself already did, those fans were almost always louder than these. The included thermal paste is great, I love that they give you a real squeeze tube and not a one-time-use plastic baggie you have to tear and squeeze the paste out of. This is much easier to apply, and you can save some for if you do an upgrade later on and need to reapply it.The RAM clearance is not just great, it is also somewhat adjustable by mounting the first fan even higher up on the grill if you need even MORE space above the RAM. This can easily fit a tall RAM heat sink, even if it is fairly close to the CPU, as was the case in my PC. I'm really amazed at how something so huge in itself also stays out of the way of everything else in the case.Cooling was simply outstanding, this dropped my temps by almost 20C at all times, and 40C from maximum CPU stress, versus the stock fan- it was just crazy! At 265W TDP, this is frankly overkill on all but the most intense builds, and easily accommodates my generic ratio-step overclocking without even breaking a sweat.This is without a doubt the finest, most rugged CPU cooler I have ever had the pleasure to own, and it install and removes easily for nearly effortless CPU upgrades. There is not a single bad thing I can say, this met and even exceeded almost every expectation I had, and I enthusiastically give it a full 5-stars!!",

                "reviewText": "At the $75 price point, this cooler has a bunch of competition, even from big names like the brown and other lighter brown company. So why does this cooler deserve it's 5/5 stars? I literally cannot tell you. This cooler performed great, I've had large air coolers like this from many different brands, noctua, deepcool, Thermaltake, thermalright, Id-cooling, and I'll be honest, All these large coolers perform really close to each other. I mean at most I think I've seen 5 degree differences on some of these coolers. I currently have 5 builds and I have used all these coolers so I speak from real experience. So why choose this PCcooler one? Well I still can't say. It's got the best kind of mounting system, but then again several of the brands I listed also use the same type of mounting system too... The fans are quiet and perform well, but if you go brown you can get some even quieter fans.... But hey maybe it really is a good thing that this cooler just performs well enough that it doesn't become the odd one out of the bunch. PCcooler has been around for a short while, but my experience with them has been pretty good. I remember their RGB ring type fans were really popular for a while since they were so quiet and had RGB when that was really hard to find in a cheap price range. So maybe give this cooler a shot to see how far a smaller cooler company has gotten. I'm pretty impressed and happy with this cooler and I think you would be too. Fair warning though, I don't have a CPU that pushes all these coolers to their limits, just a 12700k. Maybe in the upper limits and you're hunting every degree you can, does it really make a difference. $75 I say its worth it, but shop around and choose by a design you like rather than a name. 5/5 stars!",

                "reviewText": "I had to replace the cooler on my PC because my old one wasn't working properly. It was easy to install on a Ryzen chip/motherboard. It came with a fan, two mounting clips, and a tube of their own brand of thermal paste. The thermal paste seemed a bit less liquidy than some others I've used but it worked well and my CPU temperatures remain well within normal range. It only comes with 2 fan mounting clips, so if you want to use 2 fans you'll need to get additional clips. The fan can be mounted on either side and it has arrows on the side indicating the airflow direction.The cooler is nice and solid. It's pretty unassuming except for the one corner where there's a triangle pattern and a little orange sliver that doesn't light up but refracts any light it receives. With enough light in the case, it looks like it lights up and with very little light you basically can't even see it. It was solidly black, with no chips and no bent fins.I've been running it for days with no issues and good temperatures (Ryzen 7 5800) when playing games. It also runs surprisingly quietly for an air cooler, no louder than the AIO it replaced. The cost seems reasonable for a nice hefty air cooler that works well. I just wish they'd included extra mounting clips in case you wanted to put fans on both sides of the cooler. Otherwise, it's perfect.",

                "reviewText": "I tested this CPS cooler against my be quiet! Dark Rock 4 to see how it would perform. The CPU is a Core i9-10900 on an ASUS Maximus XIII Hero motherboard. My expectation was that, given its size (smaller tower and fan than the Dark Rock), the CPU would probably run a couple degrees hotter using the CPS K4. That would have been fine actually given that this cooler is about half the cost of the Dark Rock. To my surprise, the CPS K4 performed BETTER! The results are below:Cinebench R23 multicore score:CPS K4: 14512Dark Rock: 14293Cinebench R23 single core score:CPS K4: 1292Dark Rock: 1293CPU package temp - Celsius (while running the tests):CPS K4: 30 (idle) to 89 (full load)Dark Rock: 32 (idle) to 92 (full load)Core temps - Celsius (while running the tests - average):CPS K4: 28 (idle) to 89 (full load)Dark Rock: 30 (idle) to 92 (full load)I also got numbers for Cinebench 2024 and they showed the same pattern: The CPS K4 has the CPU consistently 3-4 degrees cooler than the Dark Rock. Add that to the fact that the CPS K4 is priced at almost half of what I paid for the Dark Rock, and you have a good cooler choice right here.I really like the look of this cooler as well and the fact that it takes up less space than the Dark Rock is a bonus. The installation instructions in the manual are clear and easy to follow. The fan is indeed 130mm (not a size I commonly see, usually it's either 120mm or 140mm) and it does a great job at moving air. The only small down side is that the fan gets quite loud when at full speed. Given its cooling performance though, I'm quite ok with that.This cooler definitely gets an easy recommend from me.",

I was also pleasantly surprised with the fan's performance to noise & it is more than enough to keep my 5600 in check.The one thing to keep in mind is that if you have a higher performance CPU, stepping up to one with 5+ heat pipes (or in some instances with the newer intel CPUs, ones designed to target the correct location of heat on the chip) may be better than this one.But for 90% of other applications, I would strongly recommend this cooler,",
