                "reviewText": "ID-Cooling has been making quality PC parts for years and this is not the first item from them I have installed in my computer. I was very happy with my previous cooler from them and this one is no exception- in fact, I think I like this cooler even more because the mounting system has been improved, making it much easier and less frustrating to install. This cooler is perfect for an SFF PC case. Its short stature and small diameter allow it to fit in even the tiniest of cases. Conversely, it can also work in a full sized tower PC case, but in that case I would worry about it not having the proper amount of power. It is intended for and most at home in a small case.This is how I installed mine, in an SFF case, and I was impressed by how sleek it looked- the black, bold lines matching perfectly with my small form GPU and chosen fans. When I turned my new PC on I was further impressed by how quiet it was. Its certainly not the quietest cooler in the world (it wont be beating any Noctua coolers, for instance) but it was nearly as quiet and effective at cooling, and for less than half the price of a Noctua its a total bargain, and I am willing to sacrifice a couple dB to save $40+, and I think many others will feel the same.Yes, I am happy to recommend this ID Cooling air cooler. It has not let me down in any way, just like every other product I have from them. They truly seem to care about quality, economy, and the customer.",

                "reviewText": "Performs shockingly well for a low profile cooler, for it's small size it packs a TON of cooling power into a small but very dense package. Has as many heatpipes as some much larger coolers and a very well designed fin stack to go with them.It is a downflow style cooler so good case ventilation will help a lot with pushing the hotter air away and giving it a fresh supply of cooler air.Compared to the stock AM4 wraith cooler, this blows it out of the water despite being smaller.An absolute king tier cooler for Mini ATI and Micro ITX builds, and from what I have tested can handle the heat pumped out by higher tier CPUs. For a midrange build this will absolutely handle a 5600x or 7600 no problems at all. Upper tier 12/13th gen i5 and i7, no sweat.The design lets it fit with any motherboards I have, low profile or taller ram.All the heatpipes cover the entire coldplate, making sure that no mater what CPU and where the package is under the IHS there will be heatpipe coverage.The low profile fan is exceptional, but if you wanted, could be replaced with any larger 120mm fan should you have the room.An absolute masterclass in design efficiency and compatibility.My new top pick for small formfactor builds not wanting to deal with an AIO.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a low profile for my custom hp elitedesk. I've done some pretty heavy cutting mods to this thing and stuffed in a low profile rtx4060. Mounting this cooler was no different. I had to cut the original standoff mounts that the original cooler mounted to. But everything fit right in perfectly. Had to make sure to plug in the cpu power before mounting the cooler to the bracket as there is no way to get around the heatsink once the motherboard is mounted. This thing is pretty quiet even under load wich is nice. Great value low profile cooler. Side note my copy did come in kinda beat up. Two bent fins and the main heat pipes are slightly bent too. But the cooler works well anyway",

I have thick ram w/ heat syncs that are taller than normal sticks and this still has enough room to not intrude on them, the fan is very powerful yet literally produces no noise. installation was VERY easy and comes with the proper mounting kits for a variety of different sockets! heavily recommend!",
