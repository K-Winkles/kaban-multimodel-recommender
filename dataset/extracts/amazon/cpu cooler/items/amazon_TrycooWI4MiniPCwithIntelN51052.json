                "reviewText": "This thing makes me feel old. I remember when mini-PCs were awful Windows CE machines that were little more than a weird PDA. Some of those things didn't even have internal storage. They'd just have a CF slot. They were...not great. This is just a Windows 11 computer. It works like a Windows 11 computer. Unless I'm gaming or doing something that requires tons of ram or CPU power, it acts about the same as the $4,000, custom built gaming machine that I'm typing this review on. Obviously, if you tried to boot up something like Cyperpunk 2077, you'd quickly see that this isn't a gaming machine, but that's not what it's supposed to be.This computer is currently sitting in my cousin's room in my house. She uses it for her WFH data entry job. It runs Excel all day without a single issue. She usually also has Firefox open and tends to watch YouTube videos all day on it as well. It does just fine with all of that. Her job is not one of those that spies on her nonstop, so there's no invasive software running in the background to slow it down.It does not get hot, at all. I was expecting it to get toasty after running for a while, but it is perfectly cool, even when it's on 24/7. My cousin also has it hooked up to her TV, and she watches movies on it. It doesn't get how with that either, and has no problem streaming whatever.This is perfect for someone who just uses their computer for the internet. If you aren't gaming or editing videos or doing any kind of rendering, this will work just fine for you. Now, it's all but useless for modern gaming. It will run old stuff just fine though. By old stuff, I means stuff from 20 years ago. I don't mean Skyrim. You can watch videos all day and it will work just fine. Want to type up documents on Word? It will have zero problems with that. Now, you will run into limitations if you go crazy with the tabs. I can't have 2000+ tabs open at once like I do on my main computer, but that computer has 128GB of RAM. Also, you probably shouldn't have 2000+ tabs open. I'm just too lazy to bookmark anything. You can upgrade the RAM easily to help with RAM related issues anyway.The one thing I wish this had was a place for an extra HDD. I like that you can replace the M.2 drive that's in there, but an extra slot would be nice.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this to set up a small, home media PC. Out of the box this unit was rattling around like there was something loose inside. Upon closer inspection, several of the screws holding components had fallen out. Two fell out of the external case (I was only able to recover 1 of them). Four more screws were rattling around inside the case, which I needed to open up to service. They were the screws holding the motherboard on. Overall, very unimpressed with the poor assembly quality.Otherwise, the unit is working well. It does have Windows 11 installed. I was very concerned that I was required to use my MSN account to set up the computer. At first I thought this might be a scam to harvest account information, but it turns out it's a dumb requirement Microsoft implemented for Windows 2011. I don't really use this unit for anything but playing media and browsing the internet. It works really great for these purposes. The unit is very small, and very quiet.Took a star off for the poor build quality. Really no excuse for 6 loose screws on important components. It makes me wonder how long this will last. If there are any significant changes involving longevity or parts quality as I continue to use it I will update this review.",

                "reviewText": "These mini PC's pop up all over amazon, they're almost all the same and perform the same as well. That being said, this spec with the n5105 and 8gb of memory makes a great little mini pc for some light work. This is the type of PC I would maybe put in a guest room or for a child's room so that they could have a computer to use if needed. I have also seen others use it in the garage, or even at small businesses in the front area to display ads or something on a TV. These computers are just so small and versatile and that's where they really shine. They obviously won't perform the same as a computer that costs 6x as much, but these mini PC's really do well at just light and basic tasks. Great price for a small window's machine. 10/10 rating for me!!",
