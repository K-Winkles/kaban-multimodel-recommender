All hardware was included and directions were short and to the point.The lian li fans are great. All fans come installed and daisy chained. There is only one cable. Albeit proprietary but with the included splitter the rgb and fan power gets transferred on individual pin sets. This splitter has standard ends and can be hooked to any mobo or other cables. I do like this implementation of the daisy chained fans. Compatible with anything and everything.Highly recommend this to anyone with the space for a 360 aio. I clearly don't and have all ready ordered a new case.",
