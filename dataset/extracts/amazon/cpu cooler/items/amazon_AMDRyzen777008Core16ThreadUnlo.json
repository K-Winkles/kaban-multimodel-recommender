                "reviewText": "After building my workstation (7950X bea$t for work needs) my wife started getting fomo, so I built a more reasonably budgeted machine for her around the 7700 (non X variant) and a Gigabyte Aorus Master as that MB has been consistently solid with mem compatibility (for me anyway).At stock power (65W) it's only a few percentage points off of the 7700X, and with a bit of curve optimization it can even hang with my workstation build at anything below fully threaded loads (i.e., rendering, sim compute, compilation, etc.).In everyday, normal computing use, it's absurdly fast and efficient. Nearly a third less power of the 7950X machine, but delivering between 60 ~ 90 percent of the performance across all of my benchmarks and tested use cases. That's crazy good for a machine that costs 1/5 the price.Unless you're chasing a handful of extra frames in games, or have very specific workloads where time = money, I can't see much justification in spending more money, to use more electricity, that generates more heat to cool, for like ~5% more performance with the X variant. This 7700 does nearly identical work much more efficiently, for less money.",

                "reviewText": "Its a good product and its almost as powerful as the 7700x. Its power consumption is also much lower and thus stays cool. Also, the included heatsink has thermal paste applied already so you don't need to purchase that seperately. Additonally, My pc only has 1 exhaust fan and no intake fans so the 7700 paired with my overclocked 1660ti stays moderately cool at all times. This is also due to my pc case the Phanteks P300a having a mesh front providing less air resistance. I believe this is the perfect CPU bundle to not have to buy other things such as the heatsink, extra fans, thermal paste while at the same time having a incredible amount of performance.",

That being recognized, The AMD r7 7700 is a good CPU, with eight powerful cores on a single CCD, PBO capability which puts it up with the 7700x, and an included, tastefully RGB stock cooler that works fine. This is a good option for a lot of folks, but most mid to high end buyers will probably pass this in favor of other interesting options.",

                "reviewText": "Was building a new pc in the Hyte Revolt 3 mini itx case. Was super uncomfortable with purchasing any Ryzen \u2018X\u2019 variant due to the temperatures reaching up to 95 degrees! So I waited for the lower TDP chips to come out and absolutely love this processor. Running with a 280 mm AIO in a small mini ITX case the temperatures under stress tests settle in at 68 degrees and only mid 50s when gaming.Highly recommend for small builds and even those looking for 95%~ of the performance of the X skus with half of the power drawALSO verify your cooler comes with AM5 compatible mounting hardware. Used a NZXT 280 AIO and had to purchase a different bracket that makes better contact with the AM5 platform processors.",

                "reviewText": "Shipping: Painless. It arrived ahead of schedule, with no damage whatsoever (other items were in the box).Performance: I've seen reviews that have the chip anywhere from ~-5% to +3% of the 7700X and, my particular chip runs at -3.3% that of a 7700X (real world testing, aggregate from LTT, J2C, PC Parts Picker and GN). That is at stock; I haven't overclocked it or changed the power limits.Contents: Besides the chip and Ryzen sticker, the non-X R7s come with an AMD cooler (in my case, a Wraith RGB). This is not going to win any performance awards but it is good enough for most daily driver tasks and non-overclocked gaming.Cost: In my case, I was able to pick this up for $435 all in - $55 less than the R7 7700X.Recommendation: This chip should be an easy choice for anyone looking to build their first AMD rig. The 7700X will offer better performance and better overclocking potential but it runs hotter than the 7700 and uses more power. What I find most people don't talk about is the hidden cost of the 7700X: since it does not come with a cooling solution, the user must provide one - and neither the Stealth nor Wraith coolers will be able to do the job adequately. This means that what was a $40 + tax price hike now becomes closer to $85 + for an air cooler or $100 + for a liquid cooler. (For a 7700X I would recommend a liquid cooler because of the higher temps.)The 7700 performs as well as a 7700X but with a lower TDP, lower power requirement, lower price tag and an included cooler. New builders and anyone looking to game while saving a dollar can't go wrong with any chip in the non-X R7 series.",
