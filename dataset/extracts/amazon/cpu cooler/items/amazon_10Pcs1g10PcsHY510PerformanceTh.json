                "reviewText": "I tested the performance of this brand with offerings from Icy Diamond and Noctua. I used an AMD Ryzen 7 1700, a 65w TDP chip with 8 cores and 16 threads clocked at 3ghz, that can (and did) boost up to 3.6ghz under load. I used a fairly standard single fan tower cooler from Thermaltake. No overclocking was done to the CPU or RAM.By comparison, this thermal paste performed slightly worse than the others by about 1c, within margin of error, so it did pretty well. The long term test of it holding up for a year in a system will have to wait as most of the better brands can generally last at least 2 years before you'd want to reapply it because of dry out. With the testing I'd done though, I'd say you're probably fine using this paste, at least with a lower TDP processor like am i3, i5, Ryzen 3 or 5, and possibly a 7 depending on the cooling demands.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good value bulk-package for some very basic thermal paste. Its not great for high-end CPUs or overclocking, but will be perfectly adequate for average use.I give it kudos for not trying to make false claims about its thermal conductivity and pretend it is some sort of enthusiast-grade product when it is not.It is also a very valid solution for voltage regulators and other types of ICs. I will probably put it to use when making repairs to the power amplifier section of ham radios.Checking with a multimeter, it does not appear to be electrically conductive, so that can be a benefit in some applications as well.",
