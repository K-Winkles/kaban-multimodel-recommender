                "reviewText": "There are surprisingly not a lot of CPU liquid coolers that have LGA1700 compatible mounts. Yes, it's only $8-$10 for the mount separately, but I don't care for that. I want it all included. I just want to turn off my brain, install it, and move on with my life.- Easy to install. Just follow the instructions. And god forbid you have problems - just youtube it.- All provided screws are good quality. Nothing alarming. Just don't be bad. There are a lot of subpar CPU coolers out there (don't waste your time on stock or cheap ones; the radiator, pump, something will die).- Nice LEDs - not that it really matters to me.- Excellent performance - I was able to overclock my 11700k to 4.1GHz and still get 60C peak during gaming. This cooler gives me a false sense of being able to 5.0Ghz (I might get frisky one night with dear Strix II) At base 3.6GHZ - the peak I've seen is 55C. All very good and respectable temperatures.- Excellent fans - relatively efficient and solid airflow. I have a compact case, so the quality fans help keep the GPU cool as well.$125 - $150 is the sweetspot for a high performance cooler, without breaking the bank. I wouldn't waste my time or risk something below $100. Not biased, just have to look at your PC's life with your investment. And this is a good one.Fantastic CPU cooler. It's a high performance cooler that has the bells and whistles (if you so desire; I could care less though). I wanted something that wasn't going to give me a headache and to be worry free for at least 3 years. The stock cooler with my PC was a nightmare. Thank you, Asus, as per usual.",

                "reviewText": "Update... I should have checked the actual core usage when I posted the temperature under load. With only a couple of cores at 100% the system still reports 100% CPU. So more correctly, under 100% CPU load of a core or two the temperature is roughly 60C. With all 16 cores at 100% then the temperature hits 95C fairly quickly but cools off fast as soon as it's idle again. I've done a several hour long render at 95C with all 16 cores at 100% and highly recommend this AIO. Most of the time I'm not aware that it's even running, it's so quiet.*************************I just built a new system based on a Ryzen 9 7950X that's going to be used for rendering, meaning that the CPU will be running all out for extended periods. I've heard how hot the Ryzen 9 series car get and didn't want to let it get that hot. In my first test, all 16 cores and 32 threads running at 100% for 20 minutes, the CPU stayed in the mid 60s Centigrade.Very happy with the performance out of the box. We'll have to see how reliable it is over time but my impression so far is overwhelmingly positive.One nitpicky thing is that I thought I was ordering the non-RGB model but the pump is RGB and needs a USB port. I might have chosen a different model if I'd known that. But the performance is great so I'm not going to complain at this point. But you might want to be aware of that.I run a fan for air flow and also an air cleaner in my room and have to say that I never hear the AIO fans other than at powerup. Even in a totally silent room they're barely noticeable.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this for my son's 13700k, and the cooling performance has been fantastic. I preferred this cooler to the fancier ones that have displays linked to software because there is a lot of negative reviews about the ASUS software and support. My reasoning was that this is just a stripped-down hardware solution with a nice logo, zero software required - and it works exactly as expected. In fact, it's about the same price as a nice Noctua air cooler, and it looks super slick inside the case. I don't really get the idea of the in-case displays anyhow, usually a computer is sitting in a location that would make that useless, and you can just look at a software display on-screen anyhow. Bottom line - definitely recommeded.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars High performance AIO",
                "reviewText": "The Asus ROG Strix LC II 360 is a high performance AIO, and mine did come with the correct Asetek bracket and mounting hardware for Intel's LGA1700 socket. This AIO is keeping my i7-12700K at just 25 degrees Celsius at idle, and I expect it will work very well under load. According to the Asus UEFI BIOS, this cooler scores ~170 cooler points, which I gather is pretty good. It could probably be even better if I were to remount and use Arctic MX-4 or Noctua thermal paste, rather than the pre-applied paste pad.I've never been a big fan of ROG styling or the ROG gamer eye logo. Personally, I like the look of the TUF series a lot better, but ROG/Strix is Asus' higher end hardware brand. However, this AIO liquid cooler does look pretty good and the Aura RGB effects synchronized with my Asus Strix Z690-A Gaming D4 motherboard.Coming from AMD's AM4 platform, I don't really care for the cheap, flimsy plastic back-plate that most Asetek based AIOs are using for LGA1700. AM4 coolers came with beefy metal back-plates that were sturdy, secure, and better all around.Overall, I'm pretty happy with this AIO, as long as the pump lasts a long time and it doesn't leak.",
