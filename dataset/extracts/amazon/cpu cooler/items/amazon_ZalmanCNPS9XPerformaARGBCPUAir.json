I picked up this cooler due to its full black design (I was doing a blackout build) and it\u2019s price. I have to say, with only 4 heat pipes, it outperforms the competition\u2019s 5 heat pipe design (let\u2019s call them TR). The temperature are substantially lower (8 degrees) on this cooler than the 5 heatpipe on the TR on full load.The fan is whisper quite. The only reason I took a star off is the rgb leds on the fan. They do not match the other case fans in the case. It\u2019s always darker than the rest. It\u2019s really annoying. Shown in picture.Overall this product has great potential if they could fix the fan rgb and provide the cooler in white.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Temperatures line up with other 120mm towers for a 105W load",
                "reviewText": "I've tried a few 120mm 4- and 5-heatpipe towers on the same CPU, and this one performs similarly on a 105W (as reported in software) 6600K at 4.4GHz and 1.330V (it is stable a 1.290V which reduces power by 5W and 5C reported, but I used the higher voltage to make more heat for testing). Value at the time of ordering will likely play a large part in choosing a heatsink, as there are many similar options in this bracket. The fan at full speed gets a little loud, though keeps the 6600K at about 54C above ambient, except for one core at 50C above. I suspect that core has better contact under the IHS, as that difference persists across multiple mounts and heatsinks. The mounting hardware isn't great, but it isn't bad. The backplate is keyed for the different pin spacings, but the mounting ring on the CPU side just has elongated cutouts so doesn't naturally center itself. That leaves some play when tightening it down on the pins which could impact performance as it moves the centerline and the heatpipe location relative to the core. Probably not a real issue, but it does make assembly feel a little less nice.",

With its 3-Pin Connector, it plugs into your motherboard like a charm, ready to take on the heat.The 180W TDP is no joke. It\u2019s like having a mini air conditioner for your CPU. The 120mm fan is the perfect size - not too big to hog space, but not too small to compromise on performance.The 4 Direct Touch Heatpipes (DTH) are the secret agents in this operation. They\u2019re on a mission to transfer heat away from your CPU faster than you can say \u201coverclocking\u201d. And they do it with style, all while being whisper quiet.Compatibility? No worries there. Whether you\u2019re team Intel or team AMD, this cooler has got you covered. It\u2019s like the Switzerland of CPU coolers - neutral and friendly with everyone.The black color gives it a sleek and stealthy look. It\u2019s like the Batman of CPU coolers - always there, always vigilant, but never drawing attention to itself.In conclusion, if you want a cooler that\u2019s high on performance, low on noise, and big on compatibility, the Zalman CNPS9X Performa ARGB CPU Air Cooler is your go-to guy. Or should I say, go-to fan?",

                "reviewText": "Disclaimer, when I first tested this cooler, the price was $20. Now that it's $35, which is the same price as the Thermalright Peerless Assassin, and makes this Zalman CNPS9X a bit of a tough sell.Now that's out of the way, I tested this with a Ryzen 5 7600 non-X at stock power settings (no PBO) and \"standard\" fan curve on a Gigabyte B650 Aorus Elite AX, 32GB of Crucial DDR5 at EXPO 1 speeds w/ Arctic MX-6 thermal paste (this is for consistency, I usually don't test w/ the included thermal paste since the cooler might be good but the included paste could be bad). CPU temps maxed out at 83.4C with a reported max package power draw of 78.4W. My room was being heated at the moment so ambient was around 73F for reference. This performance is decent for an entry-level processor, although it might struggle on an i7/Ryzen 7.The mounting system was pretty easy to work with, it uses a giant metal bracket instead of 2 separate pieces that the cooler screws onto. Interesting, if you leave the ARGB pin unplugged, it defaults to rainbow color instead of the RGB being completely turned off. This is something to note if you're trying to use this fan for a non-RGB build.Overall, the CNPS9X's price holds it back when it's not on sale. If you need performance, the Thermalright Peerless Assassin is the same price and is one of the best performing CPU coolers on the market. There's nothing inherently bad about this thing though, but definitely keep an eye on the price; if you need ARGB there's options that are <$20, and if you need performance, there's definitely options too. Overall, this is definitely a \"if the price is right\" product. It doesn't do anything bad, but you shouldn't pair this with a really power-hungry processor, and definitely watch the price.",
