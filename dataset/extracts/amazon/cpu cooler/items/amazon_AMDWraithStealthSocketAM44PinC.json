Though, I wouldn't really recommend using this on a CPU over like 95W. I'd highly recommend using this fan! Great price, great performance, and is silent. It is also very easy to install knowing that it just fits in the AM4 socket and nothing else so there really is no extra steps.",

                "reviewText": "While building my PC, I decided to try this cooler out, considering it is frequently paired with AMD CPUs, and is a cheap name-brand option. It's low profile and sort of noisy; fan noise doesn't bother me, so that's subjective. The only issue I have is the heatsink. It was smaller than I realized, but for its price I can't complain too much. For a cooler that gets my PC up and running, it's worth it, but my CPU runs hot, so I would recommend getting something with a larger/ better quality heatsink. In short, the price reflects the amount of cooling you'll get from this CPU cooler. Does the job.",
