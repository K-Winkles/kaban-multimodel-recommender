The transistors can pass about 25 amps each (x4), so these heat sinks need to handle a fair amount of heat (~100W). The fans generate a lot of cooling and the heat sinks get pretty warm, but they work really well. And for $12 they are pretty reasonable.",

It turns out the fan's pins were shipped in the \"installed\" configuration rather than \"ready to install\", and I was not familiar with these pin types. After some work I was able to get the pins set up right. An instruction manual would have been helpful for us novices so I could spot the problem. Otherwise all seems good and it did ship with a small packet of thermal paste.",

Works great. Some people complained about the noise, but really, it's a cooling fan for a mid-2000's PC. It's not that loud.",

The heatsinks itself is good and substantial enough to cover the socket, without interfering with components, end the clip is easy to operate with just the right amount of tension. Used on a Pentium 200 non-MMX in a Compaq Prolinea. Included adapter to Molex 4 pin. If the fan speed bothered me enough I could run it at 5v and it would probably still be adequate.",

The fan and heat sink are slightly larger than the Intel assembly that came with the processor.Executive summary: you don't have to remove your motherboard to install the retainer plate.A note about installation: when I saw pictures of this product I was unsure about how to install the plate that contains the screw holes. The included retainer plate mounts under the motherboard's base plate, and the screws are long enough to protrude through the motherboard and its base plate to make contact with the retainer panel.",

The mechanism to do this is terrible, the design from this point of view is terrible. The fan has a 3-pin connector\u2026 why? why you do this with a 3-pin connector? Most mobos have 4 pin sockets to handle the CPU fan. I had to buy a separate adapter 3pin to 4-pin to be able to connect it. The support department never answers. As I bought this from overseas It will cost me the same it costs to return it. I finally had to order a new CPU cooler (Screws one). Terrible experience for me with this one, and a waste of time and money. Awful product.Honestly... I feel robbed",

Tiene buena potencia y no es demasiado ruidoso, aunque su base disipadora es completamente de aluminio, en comparaci\u00f3n con el original de Intel que trae un n\u00facleo de cobre. Mi ventilador Intel ya viejo estaba fallando y la ventaja es que se puede adaptar este ventilador a la base original de Intel porque es la medida exacta.
