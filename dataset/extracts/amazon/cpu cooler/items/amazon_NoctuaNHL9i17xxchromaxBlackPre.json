Thanks to the same proven heatsink design and NF-A9x14 PWM fan, it stays true to the NH-L9i-17xx\u2019s successful formula of fusing a height of only 37mm with strong performance and excellent quietness of operation, as well as 100% RAM and PCIe compatibility. At the same time, the chromax.black version with its black fan and black coated heatsink combines these assets with a sleek stealth look. Topped off with the renowned SecuFirm2 low-profile mounting system for Intel LGA1700 (LGA17xx family) and Noctua\u2019s enthusiast-grade NT-H1 thermal compound, the NH-L9i-17xx chromax.black is a premium choice for customers who seek an ultra-compact heatsink that looks just as great as it cools.",

This means that it won't cause issues with VRM heatsinks and doesn't overhang the RAM slots, so it's fully compatible with tall memory modules. 100% compatibility with PCIe cards on mini-ITX Some mini-ITX motherboards have the PCIe slot sitting close to the 95x95mm socket zone. While larger coolers that exceed this zone are likely to block the PCIe slot, the 95x95mm sized NH-L9i provides full compatibility with PCIe cards. New revision for Intel\u2019s LGA1700 (LGA17xx family) socket Since the original NH-L9i for LGA1200 and LGA115x has received more than 200 awards and recommendations from international hardware websites and magazines, the new 17xx revision builds on the same proven heatsink design to provide excellent low-profile cooling performance for LGA1700 CPUs.",

                "reviewText": "My AIO was not working as well as it should have, and I needed a fast solution since my idle temperatures kept climbing relentlessly... nearly 85\u00b0C! To avoid long term damage to the other components, I replaced my NZXT H1 v1 small form factor(SFF) rig's OEM AIO Cooler/Fan completely, and solely used the NOCTUA NH-L9i-17xx chromax.black instead. The difference was immediate, and the temperatures easily are in the high 30\u00b0C to low 40\u00b0C range when idle. I am thoroughly impressed with the quieter fan as well. Excellent product, that I can highly recommend to other users.",

Theres no wiggle room so it will hit around the inside of the vrams and m.2 areas unless you go literally straight down. the easy part is putting the 4 screws into the back of the motherboard but when you're trying to put on the cooler, having just a single extra hand will help because you can have that person hold the cooler and motherboard while you screw in the 4 screws.",

I have idle temps at around 35 C, but it'll shoot up to 70-80 C when playing a game or something.I honestly just thought a big Hyper 212 style cooler was going to be overkill since I didn't plan on overclocking. Hopefully I'll be able to return this and trade up for a water cooled system.Literally this thing is at the same level as my motherboard heatsinks.So between the small amount of heatsink material since it's low profile and my graphics card churning out heat at max load, this cooler really struggles to dissipate any significant amount of heat.Installation is pretty easy but it could've either done with better instructions or a more robust mounting system.I think this cooler would be great for perhaps a firewall or NAS, etc.",
