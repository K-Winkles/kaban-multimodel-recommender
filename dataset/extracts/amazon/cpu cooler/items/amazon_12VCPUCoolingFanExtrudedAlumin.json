                "reviewText": "My 12 year old cooling fan died and the heat buildup fried my AMD Quad core 965 cpu. I upgraded to an AMD 6 core and used this fan to replace my old one. I installed the fan on my original heatsink with no problems or modifications. I did not use the low profile heatsink that came with the fan because the 6 core is a 125 watt CPU and my research indicated that the low profile heatsinks were good for 90 watt CPU's. I could not find any CPU wattage information for this unit. It used to make a lot of fan noise when I powered up because the fan automatically ran full speed until the motherboard controller slowed it down. I found a BIOS setting that eliminated that and the CPU normally runs between 26 to 28 degrees C and the fan is very quite.",

It's fairly quiet and seems to work as advertised.Came with a 1.5 gram thermal compound syring, which is almost worth the cost of the unit.I would not buy again, but I'm fairly satisfied with this one-time purchase.",

However, I do believe my PC is attempting to run it at 3200 rpm instead of 2200 rpm causing my computer to restart. So please be aware of this.",

                "reviewText": "The new fan needed to be mounted on the old heat sink - easily done. Four screw spacers on the fan had to be removed. It snapped onto the old heat-sinkThe heat sink that came with the fan was pre-coated with thermal paste. The assembly was packaged sitting on a piece of plastic. I did not realise that it already had the paste applied and put the head sink down on the table and got the paste on the table-top. This was not a problem as I did not need or use the new heat-sink.The new fan is very quiet.Between the old fan and the old heat-sink there was a thick wad of dirt, dust, hair, etc. In the future I'll inspect the new fan (on the old heat-sink) periodically and clean it as needed.",
