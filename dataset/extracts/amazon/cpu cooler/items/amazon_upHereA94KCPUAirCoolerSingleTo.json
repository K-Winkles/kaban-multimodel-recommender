There's even room for 4 sticks of memory.Installation was easy and the hardware keeps it mounted tight and solid. It's mounted on a Ryzen 5600X and temps have been 25 at idle to 63 deg C under stress test. I used Noctua NT-H1 thermal paste and spread a thin layer over the entire surface of the CPU. I manually set the dual fans to ramp up faster in the bios based on CPU temp. The overall case is fairly quiet even though it has great front, side and rear airflow.",

I should have looked at the reviews instead.I decided to go with the Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo. I already have experience with one of these and it's been great. The retention bracket is adjustable and I can personally confirm it fits my AM3 board just fine and I was able to move it to an Intel board without issue as well.",

I currently have an AMD R7 3700X, running at base clock and this upHere A94K keeps it cool, around 41C at idle and it never goes over 55C while gaming, this summer was particularly hot, but even then it never went over 60C.Installation process wasn't that hard, I just followed the instructions and didn't have any trouble.Something I didn't like is the fans use a single cable (though is kinda convenient), which could be problematic in some situations. For example, you can't just use one fan, you have to use both; if one fan fails, you will have to buy two anyway.Overall, I like this CPU cooler size, design and color, it doesn't get loud and it's affordable.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Edit: I am changing the rating to 5 stars. I have had this cooler on my CPU for longer and actually took time to take the motherboard out to replace the CPU (12th to 13th gen) and the temperatures stay well within the limit. I went from as 12700F to a 13700KF. The fans run now between 1100 and 1350 RPM. Very quiet at 37-38 DBA. I am not running overclocked or undervolted as the CPU delivers enough performance for my type of load.I will add some pictures later when I have the RGB all sorted. The installation is just okay. It is tough to line the brackets up. After some trial and error, I figured it out, and that is the easy part. The fans \"clip\" on, man are those ribs sharp. I got the fans on, but that took me 45 minutes. It does not matter now anymore. Take your time. The temperatures: before change around 50 with normal general usage. Right now they have dropped to 30 degree and that is nice, not going to lie. It took me around an hour and 20 minutes to install this cooler, most of the time was fiddling with the mechanism to get the fans on the cooler. This does require having the motherboard out of the case, it can be done with it in the case, but be prepared for some time to get it right.Cost was certainly a big benefit here, and it fits my ATX mid-tower case nicely.",

I write again (If you can't upload images on Amazon, you are at the wrong place) :I had the original cooler for years. My CPU was going to 85-90 C no stop even in a good gaming case. The last time I changed my thermal past, I saw one of the legs started to break so I decided to buy this one. We are not in summer yet but so far my CPU is always at 30 C idle in my desktop and I think about 45 very max 50 C when I game (Note : I'm on a i7-2600 UNCLOCKABLE CPU so if you overclock it, it will of course go higher).I was a bit mad when I saw I had to unplug everything from my MOBO. The way it work, we must put a part on the other side of the MOBO. I then frustrated a lot with the 2 fans. The clips are hard to understand how they work and to put them in place. And finally, once everything was done and all my wires were plugged and I was in windows 10, I verified if the side of the wind was right (with a piece of paper). THEY WERE NOT ! I had to unplug everything again, frustrate on these fan clips again, switch their sides, and plug everything again. Sigh... nothing indicate the right side.I have read bad reviews about the AMD missing parts. I received Intel and AMD parts in my package. I don't know if that's what they talk about or if we need more parts but I received AMD parts... I used their thermal past and saw nothing strange about it (not too much liquid or anything), it was fine (we seem to have enough for x2 maybe even x3 applications with the syringe). The noise is not higher than my gaming case. The light : I have no RGB plug on my too old MOBO but it come with a sata plug. When you use it, you have the stock color, which is a beautiful and smooth cycling rainbow (a real rainbow with millions of colors). The luminosity is high, you see inside the case if you have a window on the side. (The light come from both fans and they cycle at the same speed and same colors). I found no problem with the manual except understand how these fan clips work.I checked other fans working with my CPU and MOBO. The cost seem average but in general I think they all should cost less (every PC components cost a fortune now). My PC is very old, paying this much for a fan is meh... But so far it work well. Once bought, you probably save on the thermal past cost cause my temp is so much lower now, I will change the past less frequently.",
