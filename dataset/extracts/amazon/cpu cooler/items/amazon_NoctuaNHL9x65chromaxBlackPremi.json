With 65 instead of 37mm height and four instead of two heatpipes, the NH-L9x65 is more powerful than its smaller siblings yet retains the NH-L9i\u2019s 95x95mm footprint, which not only ensures 100% RAM and PCIe compatibility on current motherboards but also makes the cooler more convenient to work with as it doesn\u2019t overhang near-socket connectors. Thanks to the highly optimised NF-A9x14 premium fan that supports fully automatic speed control via PWM, the NH-L9x65 runs remarkably quiet. Topped off with the professional SecuFirm2 multi-socket mounting system for Intel and AMD and Noctua\u2019s renowned NT-H1 thermal compound, the NH-L9x65 fuses everything users have come to expect from Noctua\u2019s larger coolers into a compact premium package for space restricted systems.",

While larger coolers that exceed this zone are likely to block the PCIe slot, the 95x95mm sized NH-L9x65 provides full compatibility with PCIe cards, be it on ATX, microATX or ITX. NT-H1 thermal compound Noctua\u2019s much-acclaimed NT-H1 is a pro-grade TIM solution that provides minimum thermal resistance, excellent ease of use and outstanding reliability. Chosen again and again by overclockers and enthusiast users worldwide, it has established itself as a benchmark for premium-quality thermal compounds.",

I did not want one of the 6+\" high-TDP air coolers since no matter how black they make them, they still look terrible. With my AIO, using Handbrake to convert a video resulted in CPU (i5-8600K) temps of around 85c. A little high, but acceptable. With the NH-L9x65, my Handbrake test showed a max CPU core temp of 64c at 95% CPU utilization. Perfect.Installation was very easy and the instructions clearly written. Noctua includes both the thermal compound and a screwdriver.I'm very happy with this product and it looks great in the case.",

If neve shut down but boy was it heating the house.I needed a LP cooler and I have used this cooler on several different AM5 & 12th-14th Gen processors and never had this issue before. Is it a dud? I do not know. I installed a Deep Cool unit that I use for testing and it dropped temps to 40C idle and 67C while playing Warzone @ 144p on high settings.Better luck with the new Noctua cooler i just bought.p.s. I have to usea 92mm Profile fan. I am using a ITX case for this build.",
