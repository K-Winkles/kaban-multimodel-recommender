This new production process creates a powerful yet very compact radial heat sink. The particularly thin cooling fins of the new Alpine are fanned out in a Y-shape. This increases the surface area of the heat sink and therefore the cooling capacity. Wide RPM Range The Alpine 23 features a new motor technology with a very wide, PWM-controlled RPM range. This keeps the noise level at a minimum while guaranteeing maximum cooling performance when needed. Lower Power Consumption & Low Vibration The new Alpine 23 is powered by an updated motor and works more efficiently. The motor produces only 5% of the commutation oscillations of a conventional DC motor by using the sine magnetization. Without compromising performance, these factors save energy, lower the motor's coil temperature and reduce vibrations to a minimum. High Quality Bearing Thanks to an alloy/lubricant combination developed in Germany, friction within the bearing is reduced and greater efficiency is achieved. As a result, there is less heat development as well as less bearing noise, which means you can enjoy a longer service life from your fan.",

I purchased this to use with older equipment that had broken stock coolers (mainly Windows 7 era hardware) and I'm happy to report that it does a great job at that! I've purchased a few additional units for a few other motherboards I'm putting together in some retro gaming builds, and so far they've all been great an quiet.Do mind the size of this unit on older builds since processor sockets didn't always have the level of open space we have today, but I can definitely recommend this for older systems as this provides more than enough to keep things cool.",

                "reviewText": "Replaced an old and loud CPU cooler on an aged yet still useful FM1 socket system running an Athlon II X4 638 quad core CPU. Even though Arctic only lists this as working with the AM4 socket, it should work with all AMD sockets that use the two clip system.Comes with pre-applied thermal paste. I usually like to use Arctic MX-4 but this MX-2 this comes with seems to work just fine too.Also has a 4 pin power connector for proper PWN fan control by the motherboard.Other manufacturers should take heed of Arctic's packaging philosophy. They strive to be green and it is very apparent by how little packaging material is used for their products. Aside from the external box there is only one piece of plastic and one piece of cardboard inside. Such little packaging but it is smartly done and still perfectly protected for shipping purposes. I always try to buy Arctic products when possible partially because of this. It also helps their products are excellent and typically inexpensive.",
