I would recommend it if you are not looking to spend even more of your set up.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I purchased this cpu cooler to replace another cpu cooler that broke a few weeks months ago. It fits in properly in my lga1151 motherboard cpu socket quite well.The noise it produces isn't really noticeable per say, but if it's open benched like this then yes. It is still audible. However, if it's in a enclose pc case with ventilation, the noise won't be so high.This cpu cooler was a simple install to a point it has no instruction manual to install. Although to be honest it did made me question its compatibility with a Lga1151 motherboard. However it connected in quite nicely with no issues what so ever.It has some cheap barebone cpu thermal paste, but I would switch it for a better brand of cpu thermal paste.Value for the money? Eh, not that much really. This thing is really designed for office pc's and not anything really intensive for gaming. The cpu would skyrocket in heat quickly with this cpu cooler, I would get something better.However, if you want it for a open test bench or for a basic replacement for a office pc. This would work just fine for that.TL:DR - Basic knock off cpu cooler that works fine.",

                "reviewText": "This cooling fan was an identical replacement for the original fan in my Asus desktop. I had seen the temp getting high on my microprocessor, and the fan was noisy. Installation was easy, but you need to get it right the first time. Locking the fan in place consists of pushing pins through the middle of plastic fingers that expand to lock the fan to the circuit board. Once the fingers have expanded, it is hard to get them small enough for a second insertion into the circuit board hole. The new fan is very quiet, and the microprocessor temp is just as it should be.",

                "reviewText": "It's a cheap knock off of the original one. Fan's made out of cheap plastic, the fins are bendable, there's no copper inlay on the back, the power wire's shorter, and the sticker's also a cheap imitation. It looks nothing like the original one in the picture.But so far it does appear to do a good job at keeping the CPU cool. Between 40\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 degrees idle, between 45\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 while under stress.Also contrary to some other comments here I do not experience any loudness from the fan. When putting my ear close enough to where it can almost be chopped off by the fan I do hear a slight rattle.So not too impressed with the quality, but positively surprised by how well it functions for said quality.",

I was looking for the one with the copper core but these are interchangeable. I know I didn't need to buy the whole thing again but it's good to have a backup",
