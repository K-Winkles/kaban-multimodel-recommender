The redux version uses the same proven heatsink layout that ensures 100% compatibility with tall RAM modules as well as excellent case and PCIe compatibility. Thanks to the popular NF-P12 redux-1700 PWM fan with automatic speed control, it provides high performance under load and runs whisper-quiet at idle. At the same time, Noctua\u2019s renowned, professional SecuFirm2 mounting system and the pre-applied NT-H1 thermal compound make installation child\u2019s play. Backed up with Noctua\u2019s trusted quality, the NH-U12S redux is a smart, affordable choice for a quiet, high-quality 120mm cooler.",

Measuring 125mm wide (including fan and fan clips), the cooler stays clear of the top PCIe slot on most standard ATX or Micro-ATX motherboards, ensuring optimum compatibility with multi-GPU setups. 100% RAM compatibility Thanks to its slim design with only 45mm fin depth, the NH-U12S redux will not overhang the RAM slots on any current platform. This gives the user full access to the memory modules and ensures 100% compatibility with modules that feature tall heat-spreaders or RGB lighting. Proven NF-P12 fan with PWM Specifically designed for pressure-demanding applications such as on heatsinks, the classic NF-P12 is a long-standing favourite among quiet cooling enthusiasts. The higher-speed 1700rpm redux line version supports PWM for automatic speed control, which allows it to run near silent most of the time and provide massive performance when necessary. Optional dual-fan kit The optional NA-FK1 fan kit makes it possible to upgrade the NH-U12S redux with a second fan in order to achieve even better performance. Containing a second NF-P12 redux-1700 PWM fan, fan clips, anti-vibration pads, a y-cable and Low-Noise Adaptors, it gives plenty of options to fine-tune the cooler for further improved efficiency or quietness of operation.",

                "reviewText": "I replaced an AIO cooler that lasted less than 2 years. This keeps my system cool, was easy to install, is quieter, and I expect it will last far more than 2 years. The AIO was nice, it dumped the heat out the top, but it was complex, pump, radiator, 3 fans, hoses. I didn't build the machine so I did not have the problems installing the AIO, It was a pain just to get it out. This is far simpler with a single fan attached to the cooler. The heat is dumped in the case, but it does fine and lets the processor run without throttling.Noctua builds nice fans and their coolers are a work of art. As far as cooling they do almost as well as an AIO. The thing is most processors are just fine with a Noctua and AIOs are just overkill. Even a \"hot\" gaming system works fine with Noctua.",

                "reviewText": "Let me begin with some clarification. I have not yet used my pc with this cooler in practical applications yet. However, I have ran the Heaven benchmark and Cinebench R23 with this cooler installed. I\u2019m running a Ryzen 7 5000 series and there is about a 25 degree difference in running those two benchmarks between the Noctua cooler and the AMD Waith stock cooler. The Noctua cooler definitely comes out ahead, which I knew it would, by a 25 degree difference. The idle temp is about 5 degrees cooler. I\u2019d love to say the fan is quieter, but I don\u2019t know. The fan on the Noctua cooler hasn\u2019t had to ramp up like the AMD Wraith cooler fan had to. For the temps I was at, 53 degrees under load, I couldn\u2019t hear the fan. While this Noctua cooler is a \u201cbudget\u201d cooler, it has performed wonderfully thus far. Installation is very straight forward, with clear instructions for the inexperienced. Noctua makes great products and is well established in the PC cooling business.",

                "reviewText": "Compared to other Nactua products the Redux line is missing some small features that allow it to be priced as low as it is. I researched to decide if these differences (a cheaper fan and the coils not being soldered to the radiator blades) and I decided it would be worth upgrading from my AMD Wraith cooler that came with my Ryzen 5 5600x. My temps were always acceptable while creeping on the hot side while under load. It wasn\u2019t till I started ripping and compressing blu-ray files that I saw my CPU hitting 91\u00b0C with the stock cooler. Since installing this Nactua Redux my temps have dropped by 20\u00b0C while idling and under load. I\u2019m not sure how much of a difference you\u2019ll see if you\u2019re already using another cooler brand but if you\u2019re still using the stock AMD cooler I can\u2019t recommend this enough. Instal was a breeze, sound levels are low, and it fit perfectly inside my Corsair 220T Airflow case.",

I've heard many good things about Noctua, so I wanted to give this a chance. The moment I opened the box, I knew I had made a good decision. First, construction is excellent on this cooler; you can tell the craftsmanship was done well, and installation was a breeze. This was the most accessible mounting system I have had to do, which was what sold me. Performance was excellent, and I maintained my CPU at 39 C ( I live in a very hot area, so this is a perfect temperature). I went on to buy an additional fan, and now it's much better. I cannot recommend it anymore.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased this with the optional second fan as an upgrade from the stock cooler that comes with my 5600.I had been looking at purchasing a Noctua cooler, specifically the NH-U12A or the NH-U12S but could not justify pulling the trigger on a $100+ cooler when the stock cooler was doing a good enough job. But then I found this cooler with basically the same performance for half the price, and I knew I had to get it.PROS:-AMAZING cooling! With the stock cooler, my CPU would get to 90+ degrees while performing a 10 minute Cinebench. With this cooler, it barely gets above 60 degrees while performing a 30 minute Cinebench test. While gaming, even under the most CPU stressing game I have (Dead Space Remake) it stays under 65 degrees with PBO enabled.-This thing is QUIET! Like I said, I had purchased the secondary fan for a push/pull configuration on my cooler and even with the second fan, this thing is silent. Really the only noise coming from my PC is from the GPU fans spinning up. Before, my PC was noisy with the stock cooler, but I didn't realize HOW noisy it was until I put this one in.-You cannot overtighten this cooler because of the spring loaded screws on the cooler-Comes with Noctua thermal paste pre applied, so you do not have to worry about paste, but get some just in case. Arctic mx-4 is $5 extraCONS:-It is tough to get the mounting hardware on without help. I managed to do it but it would be 100x easier with someone helping, or by removing the MOBO from the case. But I was lazy and didn't want to deal with that. Plus, some of the standoffs for my board are under where the fans end up sitting, so I still would have had issues with it.-Some people have had issues with motherboard compatibility, but this could be user error. I use a Gigabyte B550M DS3H and had no issues. This cooler uses the backplate that came with the board for AM4. Intel uses the included backplate.-The threads for the screws are on the mounting hardware, and when you loosen the screws on the cooler, they are not free of the screws on the mounting hardware, keeping you from turning the cooler to break the seal from the thermal paste. Since this comes with Noctua paste pre applied, good luck getting this off without a fight.-Attaching the fans is hard as hell, especially if you do it in your case. I found that doing the secondary fan (if you buy one) first, then the front fan is WAY easier than doing it the other way. And the fans might block standoff screws if you put them on outside of the case.I highly recommend this cooler, and its good to see that the Noctua name holds up even on a more budget option.",

If you are swapping your cooler, it can be a little tough to navigate inside your case and may require you to fully take your motherboard out of your case. If it is a new build (or you are swapping the case at the same time), there will be no issue, but be sure to mount the cooler and its fans before putting the motherboard in the case",

Der K\u00fchler wird mit zwei Schrauben an den Halterahmen montiert - ging aber nicht...jetzt kommts...in eine der zwei Schrauben steckte noch das Gewinde von der Intel Halterung die wohl einem K\u00e4ufer abgebrochen war...darum R\u00fccklauf...kurz um...mit Seidenschneider und Zange habe ich das restliche Gewinde herausbekommen und den L\u00fcfter montiert. Mancher wird sagen schick es zur\u00fcck. Ich dachte ich wage es...und es hat geklappt. Hab mir noch eine zweiten bestellt...werde falls es Probleme gibt berichten....",
