                "reviewText": "... why is this thermal paste so cheap, or should we rather be asking, why is all the other thermal paste so darned high?There are several YTube vids comparing all the thermal pastes, so going into it here would be redundant, and of course everyone, it seems, has their particular favorite that they swear by, and others that they swear at, and comparisons as to temps are dependent on so many factors (ambient temps, correct application of paste, etc) that I'll leave all that to the \"experts,\" and just say that like others have stated, this thermal paste works, works well, and does so at a price that undercuts the competition by so much that it has to raise one's suspicions.So, maybe we should be asking we are all the others SO HIGH and not why is this SO CHEAP?For what it is, what it does, and what it costs: Five StarsI am the Totally Unbiased Reviewer Dude (T.U.R.D.) and that is how I see it.",

                "reviewText": "I have used many tubes of this paste to do a test fitment on GPU\u2019s I repair. I get a lot of video cards in for repair that the customer changes the pads and uses the wrong size. The GPU die doesn\u2019t make a good connection which causes the GPU\u2019s to overheat and crash. I also use this during repairs to test not just GPU\u2019s but any device that uses thermal paste. I apply the cheap stuff and test. If everything works I take it apart re-clean and apply a quality paste like MX-4 for basic devices and more higher end I use Thermal Grizzly.",
