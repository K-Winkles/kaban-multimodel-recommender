                "reviewText": "This is a great CPU for general use and budget/mid-range gaming! It's able to keep up with all my computing tasks and when gaming with my AMD RX6700XT. Seriously I am very impressed. I will say that when I first installed it, the CPU was running a little warm, but nothing too bad and after a few days it seemed to settle down and now typically sits around 55-65 degrees even while gaming/computing in this hot SoCal summer. I generally see about 20% to 30% usage while playing pretty recent games on 1440p and ultra quality. Would I prefer a 5600x, 5700x or 5800x? Of course, but for the price, nothing beats the value of this CPU and I'm just not willing to spend double the price on relatively limited performance increases. As long as you're not planning to do some extremely CPU-heavy tasks or overclocking, this CPU should fit your needs perfectly. The Wraith Stealth cooler is a nice free add-on as well, although I would suggest if you're looking for ultimate performance, you might want to contemplate a tower air cooler or AIO. However, the Wraith is more than adequate by itself. Anyway, I can't recommend this CPU enough. Keep in mind though, if you're used to Intel CPUs which typically come with integrated graphics, this CPU does not (only G series AMD CPUs like the 5600G for example include integrated graphics although they don't perform as CPUs as well as non G series), so you'll have to buy a graphics card. Also keep in mind X series CPUs like the 5600x are for extreme overclocking (I would go easy on overclocking non-X CPUs and for a lower ranged CPU like this one I would not recommend any overclocking at all). Hope that helps with your decision! Thanks for reading",

                "reviewText": "For me CPUs like this, which are budget CPUs are mostly about the price. For $100 USD or less this is an excellent buy. If it's more than that, uhhhh. I'll take the 5600 for $130 Bob.While this is a Zen 3 CPU, it's not PCIe gen4 and you should be aware of this before buying. It's not the same line of CPU that most Zen 3 CPUs which are Vermeer. This is Cezanne. There are 3 Cezanne CPUs, the other two are OEM only, meaning they only come in a PC you buy from a company that makes PCs like Dell, etc........ For the most part this isn't a problem because it's a budget CPU, however if you pair this with something like an AMD Radeon 6500 XT which only uses 4 PCIe lanes to connect to the CPU, you'll get bad performance. So don't do that.Otherwise as long as you pair this with at least an 8 PCIe lane GPU it works fine. You take a tiny hit in GPU performance but not enough to worry about.The bigger hit comes with the NVMe drives, especially in 2023 and going forward. There are now MANY NVMe disks that are a lot faster than 4GB/s, and to give as simple explanation as I can, a PCIe lane is a serial data line. The way a PCIe device/bus works is by grouping a certain amount of lanes so that you get the speed of a single PCIe lane times the number of lanes you have. Any NVMe disk has 4 lanes. It also means the port you plug it into along with what it connects to (CPU, motherboard chipset) has 4 PCIe lanes that it will connect with. So, you get 4 PCIe lanes. So now you need to know the data speed for each lane. For PCIe gen3, the speed of each lane is 1GB/s. For PCIe gen4 the speed of each lane is 2GB/s. So, with this CPU, the best you can get is a data transfer rate of 4GB/s to an NVMe disk. That's it. The newest disks coming out the end of 2022, and 2023 can hit speeds near 9GB/s. Now, most data transfers to/from NVMe disks can't run at that speed. However many disks can run many data transfers faster than 4GB/s, so that means a CPU that runs PCIe gen3 is slowing down modern NVMe disks that can run gen4 or now gen5 speeds. But that's not a statement that has a clear meaning, because just because a disk is called gen4, it doesn't mean most of the data transfers to/from that disk will run at the full bandwidth of PCIe gen4 x4 lanes = 8GB/s. Most gen4 disks rarely hit that speed if ever. Only the most expensive ones do. BUT once again many will run different types of transfers above 4GB/s.So that's the description of what it means to have PCIe gen3 when dealing with modern NVMe disks. You're going to slow down some of the data transfers, not all, depending on how fast (which also means more expensive) the disk is.Yes for a general purpose PC build this is good enough and it's a low cost option that's really good at $100 USD or less. However if the price of this starts to get closer to the Ryzen 5600, I'd rather buy the 5600 because that's PCIe gen4 which is as good as it gets with an AMD AM4 motherboard.",

You can easily pair this with an older Ryzen board or low end 520m motherboard and get great gaming performance. With that said don\u2019t get confused by the Ryzen SKU numbering, this might be a 5500 but don\u2019t expect it to perform anything like the Ryzen 5600/5600X, this CPU has 1/2 the L3 cache and only supports PCI 3.0.

Same system specs, new cpu, and it's running much smoother, and faster. Now able to run the RAM at 3200, CBr23 score went up to 10389, and 3dM went up to 8400. Much better score all around.For the $99 price tag it's a pretty solid boost to the system. Worth the price.",

Por\u00e9m tenho que ressaltar a demora absurda na entrega do produto, comprei no come\u00e7o de novembro com prazo de entrega do dia 21 de dezembro ate o dia 5 de janeiro, chegou somente dia 16 de janeiro. O produto ficou preso em curitiba esperando pagamento de taxa mesmo o anuncio dizendo que as taxas ja estariam inclusas, supresa desagrad\u00e1vel, tive que por conta propria descobrir ja que nao fui avisado de nenhuma maneira, taxa pequena, entrei em contato com o vendedor ele prontamente fez o reebolso da taxa paga, responde rapido. Comprem mas atentos na demora, muito devido ao pessimo servi\u00e7o de entregas do nosso pais, e que podera ficar esperando em curitiba o pagamento de uma pequena taxa.",
