The only issue is that it does NOT come with screws bolts or anything else, and you are left to your own devices for a mounting solution. What You need is M3 .50 pitch screws about a half-inch in length. you are also going to want some washers to complement those and some rubber standoffs to counter vibration. That being said. I used this to replace those god awful dart clamps that come with the lga 1150 CPU heatsinks. I now cant push my CPU past 41c. I tried with a stress test, two even. Nothing. It's great but some assembly required, buyer beware. Also, it doesn't like to work with you when you are trying to install it, so I taped it to the back of my motherboard while I assembled it, use electrical or non-conductive tape for this.TLDR: M3 .50 pitch screws, washers, tape, and a firm grip on your sanity.",
