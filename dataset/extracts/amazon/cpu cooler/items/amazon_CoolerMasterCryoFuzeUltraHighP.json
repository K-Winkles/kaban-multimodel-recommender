The tip about heating it with hot air gun helps and makes it flow .I pasted in Rtx 3090 to begin with and it dropped the temperatures by 10 to 15\u00b0 over noctua nh1.my ram got a little bit hotter but that might be new thermal pads or heat sink receiving more heat. Impressed with the results, I used it on 3080 and rx 5700 with same results.I will probably keep repasting till I run out of it. Ordering one more.Can\u2019t comment on stability yet as it has been only a few days. The spreader is useless if you don\u2019t heat. What has worked for me is drop a blob and gently squish it with a metal prong to get some spread. Just dropping it might work too but I did a little extra.",

Just on a whim I pulled the CPU cooler off and checked the CPU for temperature paste. Much to my expectations, there was none. So, instead of sending it back to Asus again, I just decided to get some and do it myself. Well, what do you know, it actually worked, and has helped keep my computer temperature to its nominal settings.",

                "reviewText": "I would sum it up like this: The paste is excellent in performance, but would be very difficult for someone applying the first time to successfully apply.This isn't your MX4 or MX5 -- Cryofuze Ultra is very thick and dry. If you used IC Diamond back in the day think a bit more dry than that. Spreading is nearly impossible without heating the tube a bit with a hair dryer. This gives it just enough pliability to be workable.The plus side is that due to the paste being so dry, it shouldn't have any issues with oil separation. Once it's on the temperatures are great, easily rivaling what I've seen from Kryonaut. The line method seems to be the easiest if you have a high clamping force heatsink. Otherwise spreading it is next to impossible without heating the tube up.Time will tell how long it holds up and keeps good temps. I have it running on a 4790 in a HP Z1 G2 as a test. Those tend to be a little toasty, but it's done a great job bringing the temps down from the MX4 I had on there. I'm seeing 3 - 4*c temp reductions and a much quieter fan profile. The cores now idle only slightly above room temp (19.5*c room, 24*c idle)",

                "reviewText": "I've seen a lot of recent reviews of the newer 2020-21 edition of the MasterGel Maker Ultra-High Performance Thermal Compound noting that it is \"dry\" and therefore, defective because it is difficult to spread. To further exacerbate the issue, it also appears that there was a formulation change from the 2019 edition to the newer 2020-21 edition where the thermal paste consistency of the newer 2020-21 edition is similar to that of a stick of warm bubble gum as compared to more traditional thermal paste compounds, which are much easier to apply (e.g., Noctua NT-H1, Gelid GC-Extreme, Arctic MX-4, Artic Silver 5, etc.). But unfortunately, it appears that Cooler Master did not adequately inform their customers of this new formulation and how to best apply it.However, a quick search on another online retailer revealed that according to Cooler Master (See Newegg Reviews and Manufacturer Response on this exact same product), this paste is intended to be thick like a stick of bubble gum. So in light of that response, I gave it a try as I am optimistic that the long term performance will hold up well particularly for GPU applications. In the past, I've tried many thermal compounds on GPUs (e.g., Noctua NT-H1, Gelid GC-Extreme, Arctic MX-4) and typically, they have lasted between 6-8 months before dry out and the GPU load temperature climbs to 5 to 10 C higher than a fresh thermal paste application. So I thought perhaps Cooler Master might have the right idea here with their newer 2020-21 edition because <Roll Safe, Finger Tapping Head Meme> thermal paste can't dry out if it's dry already</Meme>.So, I applied this stick of bubble gum in a tube by: (1) squeezing out a little bit at a time, (2) pushing down on the surface to ensure what little came out stuck to the surface (e.g., surface of the GPU die), and (3) moving one-two millimeter across the surface. Steps (1)-(3) were repeated until the entire surface was covered, albeit with some moderate difficulty. Once done, this product does perform well, roughly just as well as Noctua NT-H1, Gelid GC-Extreme, and Arctic MX-4 on my overclocked MSI Duke 1070 ti (+120% Power Limit, +175 Mhz GPU, and +450 Mhz RAM OC). So far (3.5 months since application) the performance of MasterGel Maker has stayed fairly consistent, i.e., 72 to 75 C at 100% GPU load with Furmark and 60% GPU fan speed with ambient room temperature between 22-26 C. Hope this helps!",

I ended up using an x pattern because I wasn't sure about how this paste would spread. Despite this, my thermal performance has been quite good. At the end of the day the thermal paste you use doesn't make a big difference in performance but this has been running my Ryzen 5 5600 with a Hyper 212 black a little bit cooler than it did before I had changed the paste. At idle I get roughly 38 degrees C. Great price, slightly cheaper than most other well-known alternatives so that was a plus.",
