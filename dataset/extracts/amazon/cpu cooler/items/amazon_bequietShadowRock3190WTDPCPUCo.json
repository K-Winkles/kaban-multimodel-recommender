                "reviewText": "SummaryPROS-Completely silent at low loads, reasonably quiet at max fan speed-5 to 10 degree Celsius improvement over stock AMD Wraith Stealth cooler (for Ryzen 5 3600)-Relatively easy installation-Well packaged-All required tools and mounting hardware included - even a screwdriver-You can add another fan if you really wanted to-No clearance issues with I/O shield or tall RAM-Minimal aestheticsCONS-AMD mounting instructions could use refinement and diagrams that don't show the Intel bracket-Easily bent fins-Fan doesn't have sleeved cablesNEUTRAL-Very tall - check your case clearance before buying-One color option-No RGB optionI purchased this cooler to replace the stock Wraith Stealth cooler that came with my Ryzen 5 3600. While the stock cooler offers good enough performance for daily use and gaming, its high-pitched noise and small fan size gave it a very intrusive acoustic profile (translation: loud and annoying).In looking for a CPU cooler, I wanted a unit with high acoustical efficiency - the quietest possible unit that could still keep my CPU at reasonable temperatures that wouldn't cause throttling under normal loads (so under ~80 degrees Celsius).I had high hopes for the be quiet! Shadow Rock 3 cooler based on reviews, and I have to say it met and even exceeded all expectations. With the same fan curve from my stock cooler, it is completely silent under everyday use (60% PWM at idle/low-load temperatures) and dropped idle temps by around 5-10 degrees Celsius. When gaming, I can't hear it over my GPU fans (EVGA GeForce 1660 Super), and my CPU maintains the advertised boost clock. Even if I manually turn up the fans to the fastest speed, it's still reasonably quiet and is low pitched enough as to not be intrusive. be quiet! includes mounting hardware for a second fan should you want to do a push-pull setup, but I honestly can't see why you would unless you were seriously pushing a higher-end CPUFor $50, the only real complaints I have are that there aren't other color options (e.g.: all black or all white) or RGB options, and the AMD mounting instructions need refinement. The instructions tell you how to attach the mounting bracket to the motherboard, but then proceeds to show an Intel bracket when telling you how to mount the tower cooler. Additionally, the instructions tell you to mount the cooler on top of the CPU before putting on the screws and screwing them in. If you follow that step, as I did, you'll find that there is no room to squeeze the screws in under the large tower and will end up having to take the cooler off first, which is frustrating.",

                "reviewText": "I upgraded all my fans on my home machine to \"be quiet\" fans and have used many of their products over the years. 4 years in on an AMD 3950X and this does better than a lot of air coolers that cost a lot more and also the big thing, I have installed several of these and never had a problem with ram clearance on ANY full atx board amd or intel and that's a big thing. No RGB but you cant see this machine anyway since I have to have a full metal case so I didn't want it and could care less. To me pc's should not be seen or heard. Changed all the case fans over from stock to the \"be quiet\" fans and most of the time you wouldn't know its running and that was the goal. I have also used their cases which are just as wonderful. If your not looking for flashing lights you cant get much better for the money and the heatsink itself is extremely well built and designed. Cools better and faster than most of the typical stand up radiator coolers out there and is capable of twins in a push-pull but you wont need it. If your an extreme over-clocker then your looking at water anyway and wouldn't want this but for a tame high end machine this will surprise you. As always DO YOUR HOMEWORK FIRST AND KNOW WHAT YOU NEED AND HOW YOU PLAN TO USE YOUR MACHINE. No device made will work well if you don't understand what your needs are first.",

                "reviewText": "The Noise Level is very quiet up past half speed, and not very loud at full speed. You can keep the RPM down around 400rpm completely silent for most computer activity. Except when running Cinebench R23. That will heat the CPU in a hurry.I tried this Be Quiet cooler with an i7-11700 and an i7-11700k CPU, the motherboard was an ASUS Tuf Games Z590. I am a little disappointed the motherboard does not let you set a max core temperate, but that is another story. The option is there in the bios, but it does not allow me to set it for some reason.Temperature Tests I ran used Cinebench R23 multi-core setting to keep CPU busyTests with i7-11700 locked CPU=========================Okay this Cooler will work great if not overclocking, holds i7-11700 down to 74C at 176watts (a little warm)Meanwhile the ASUS motherboard does allow turning off the INTEL default multicore throttle, not good 92C at 194.2Watts. So while it did keep the CPU from smoking, I doubt the CPU could handle 92C for the long haul.Summery i7-11700 (locked cpu):74C at 176 Watts (obeying all intel throttle rules)92C at 194.2 Watts (ignoring intel throttle rules)Tests with i7-11700K unlocked CPU============================i7-11700K not overclocked and obeying Intel throttle rules processor went to 83C at 199 Watts (a bit to warm in my opinion)now if you turn on first level overclock on the i7-11700K forget it, CPU quickly went to 95C at 222 Wattsif you choose extreme overclock forget it, the CPU quickly ran up to 100C at 237 Watts and I canned the test to protect my CPU.Summery i7-11700k (unlocked cpu):83C at 199 Watts (obeying all intel throttle rules and no overclocking)95C at 222 Watts (fast overclock)100C at 237 Watts (extreme overclock) *i shut test down with in seconds, need a bigger coolerSo with all that said, I ran many test and this air cooler, looks really nice in the case, it is extremely quiet under normal load with no over clocking. However if you want to overclock an i7-11700K or ignore throttle rules with the i7-11700 this cooler will not keep up. Which based on the wattage makes sense being as this is sold a cooler up to 190 Watts. I need to get a 250 Watt cooler, which I will eventually do.I can't decide on the newer BE Quiet Dark Pro 4, BK022 250Watt cooler or the Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black 140mm cooler? Does anyone have any suggestions?Meanwhile other positives, It does not cover the Memory at all, which is a bonus because I love the looks of the Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB memory..If I think of anything I will edit this post, but bottom line great cooler with many positives, but it should not be used with an over clocked or unlocked i7-11700k CPU.",
