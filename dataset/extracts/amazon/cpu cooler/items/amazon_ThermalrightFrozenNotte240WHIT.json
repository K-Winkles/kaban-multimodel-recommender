                "reviewText": "Like Andie's review, I installed this AIO into my ssupd Meshilicious case. I didn't have any issues with packaging or damage. The loose screws and unprotected block reported by Ryan on the review with the title \"Works good, great price but the packing wasn\u2019t the best\" was not my experience, so I believe they may have received an open box item. I felt like the packaging was more than adequate and typical. Amazon delivered the box in plain sight with no box or bag around it, which I didn't love, but it arrived in perfect condition.The results are fantastic! I used this to cool a 5600X3D, which has similar thermal properties to the 5800X3D (hot!). I was coming from a 65W chip that I cooled with the Noctua L9a, which left the 5600X3D thermal throttling at 90 degrees C. (To be fair, the L9a was never designed for a 105W chip, never mind the extra-hot X3D series).With this AIO, I get temperatures that refuse to exceed the 60-degree Celsius range even under full load running Cinebench. The chip stays at the boost clock of ~4.4Ghz indefinitely. I have no frame of reference nor measuring tools to test noise levels regarding competing AIOs, but I find the noise level to be perfectly acceptable, especially considering the amount of space the Meshilicious has to work with. Some of the top rated budget AIOs don't actually fit the Meshilicious, or *require* that you replace the fans with slim variants, which I did not do. (Andie isn't wrong about slim fans being easier to work with on the Meshilicious, I just didn't want to spend more money)In a larger case, you may be able to save money and complexity with a dual tower fan and heatsink, but in the Meshilicious combined with the low price of this item, I think going with an AIO is a no-brainer. After all, the case is designed with this idea in mind.My other thought was to buy the Thermalright AXP120-X67 air cooler, which is drastically cheaper, but I thought about how the larger component would probably block access to the RAM and other components, and I figured that an AIO would perform better anyway. And at the price of this AIO, it was hard to say no. I can't imagine any air cooler that fits into the Meshilicious performing this well with an X3D part, so I think it's the right choice.I agree with Andie that if I had to do it over again, I would probably buy an AIO with the pump in the waterblock rather than sitting on the tube getting in the way. In this price class, you can look at IO-Cooling product line (e.g., the ZOOMFLOW). However, I didn't think it was a big problem, just a minor nuisance.Word of warning to Meshilicious users: I do not think this product will fit very well if you've got a full ATX power supply in there. My tubes route between the PSU and the mesh case, and that wouldn't work with a wider PSU. Stick with SFX. At best you would have to do some nasty routing if you have ATX, at worst it won't fit at all.Regarding the pump, it's notable that it is only attached to one of the two tubes. The other side of the pump floats freely over its tube, so it gives the tubes perhaps more flexibility than you might imagine.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this AIO for my living room small form factor PC, Meshlicious case. This is NOT recommended as it is a very tight fit, but it DOES fit, even with the full-size included fans. If you\u2019ll be using this in a regular size ATX, MATX case then you should be fine. If you are dead-set in using this for SSF case then may I at least suggest you get one with the pump on the cpu block. The pump on this cooler is on the tubes which makes it just a bit tough to fit in Meshlicious because the motherboard tray hits the pump.For the price this is an excellent value. I like the aesthetics, white radiator, white rgb fans, white cables, infinity mirror. It\u2019s a very clean looking cooler. Using the silent fan profile, the fans are not audible from sitting distance, about 4 feet. The pump is also very quiet in performance profile, but does have a whine at full speed. I left it in performance. Your motherboard fan profiles will vary.Anyways, I had an issue with one of the fan cables being \u201cpinched\u201d outta the box. I messaged Thermalright and they replaced the fan. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t sell the same fans that come included separately so they are sending a similar but not the exact fan. This is good customer service and will be buying more Thermalright coolers but I wish all the fans would match for aesthetic purposes. \ud83e\udd72 I would have liked if they sent 2 of the same fans. I like the cooler and was ready to begin my build so I didn\u2019t return it for another.But since this is for my SFF Meshlicious case I swapped fans for slim fans that i had on hand to make the installation easier. The actual cpu block installation is easy as pie, though I installed it upside down in order to give the tubes space, and supports both AM4/AM5. So when it\u2019s time to upgrade I can reuse the cooler instead of buying a whole new AIO.This is my 2nd Thermalright cooler and based on quality, price, customer service I\u2019ll keep buying more Thermalright. I have bought stand alone fans from Thermalright and never experienced the pinched cable. Must have just been a fluke. 5 stars for the great value cooler and good customer service. Thanks Thermalright \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc4d",

                "reviewText": "Absolutely crazy how good of a deal this is. Great cooking performance and an unbeatable aesthetic. Don\u2019t even consider any other sub-$100 AIO because this beats them all. Argb fans, all white radiator, and an infinity mirror on the water block all make a great deal. Handles my Ryzen 5 4500 overclocked with ease and idle temps are low.My only complaint is the mounting bracket. To mount the block, you need to twist the block into the mourning bracket. It\u2019s very easy to untwist and remove the block from the bracket before you secure the block to the cpu. But it\u2019s a very small gripe.",
