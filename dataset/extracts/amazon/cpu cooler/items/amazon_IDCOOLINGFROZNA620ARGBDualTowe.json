                "reviewText": "I recently had the pleasure of incorporating the ID-COOLING FROZN A620 ARGB tower cooler into two separate builds, and I must say, it's been nothing short of a game-changer. This cooler isn't just a component; it's the centerpiece of any case, bringing a blend of striking aesthetics and top-notch cooling efficiency to the table.The FROZN A620 doesn't just look great; it performs spectacularly, especially considering its price point. I've tested it with lower wattage CPUs, specifically the i5-13400 and i5-13600K, and the results were impressive. The cooler maintains optimal temperatures, ensuring smooth and reliable performance under various workloads. Its design, featuring quiet fans that require minimal tuning, adds to its appeal, making it a perfect match for builds where noise levels are a concern.One of the standout features is the dual ARGB lights for each tower section, adding a vibrant touch to its visual appeal. Additionally, the inclusion of daisy-chainable fans is a thoughtful touch, simplifying the installation process by eliminating the need for splitters. This feature, in particular, is a boon for both seasoned builders and those new to the hobby, making cable management a breeze.While the cooler is generally user-friendly, newcomers to PC building might find the cable management aspect slightly challenging due to the multiple ARGB cables. Also be aware that you will need to use low-profile ram whil utilizing this cooler. However, this is a minor hurdle in the grand scheme, and the overall installation process is straightforward and quick.In summary, the ID-COOLING FROZN A620 ARGB tower cooler is a stellar choice for anyone looking to enhance their build's aesthetics without compromising on performance. Its visual flair, coupled with efficient cooling capabilities, makes it a highly recommendable option. Whether you're a veteran builder or just starting, this cooler deserves your consideration.I've posted pictures of two computer setups using the ID-COOLING FROZN A620 ARGB cooler, one in a Phanteks NV5 case and another in an Antec P20C case. The pictures are taken from the same angle to show off the coolers' design. You can see how they look in bright light, making them look sleek, and in the dark, where their bright lights really shine, showing they look great in any light.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great cooler and outside of actually going out of my way to search for their coolers, I haven't really seen them pop up on my tech sites often. This cooler is amazing, I actually love collecting coolers and have an assortment from DeepCool, Scythe, Corsair, Cooler Master, and many more. This is now installed on my Ryzen 5700x system and cools as well as the 280mm AIO I was using before moving the PC. Tower coolers are surprisingly effective but AIO's have their place. I was using a AIO before installing this because I needed something that vented directly out of the case because of constraints in space behind the PC and lack of flow patterns behind there. Now that it is moved I wanted something in place there which I think looks better than my AIO which wasn't really on view outside of the tubing and cooling block. I had a DeepCool tower cooler than looks cleaner than this, but this was a dual fan setup, which is overkill, but that also means that I can keep the system cooler while keeping RPM's lower so I took this route and it looks great. I am not using any RGB as I like the clean black look I have setup inside the case and that fits here whereas the DeepCool had a grey top plate to hide the tops of the heatpipes and hole for tensioning the cooler in place and that means that it wasn't the black look I wanted.Install on this was straight forward though. It uses the backplate of the AM4 system and you just put spacers, red in color, in place and and screw the retention bracket in place. You attach the cooler to the bracket and it was surprisingly quick, not as quick as Scythe Kabuto II which you just apply a twist to the lever on the AM4 provided retention bracket but it was still surprisingly easy.Price wise, this is very competitive, but also in the range of many others that are very competitive. Price without sale would be 49.99. There are a lot of good coolers on that price. But it was on sale as of writing this at 42.34, which feels very brief, and may be related to primeday sales, but that is a very very good price for this cooler. You will never have to worry about if it was enough for a 5700x as you can practically cool the processor passively with this tower cooler. I can recommend this and very much like the look of it.",

However, this just has a bracket with 4 rods ready to be put through the other side. With that in mind, it's easy enough to mount together on the front end. The instructions are straightforward and recommended so you know what part to use depending if it is for Intel or AMD Processors. Keep things cool!",

I was using a small fan cooler without a tower and noticed that during some intense sessions of certain games I would get hotter than I wanted so adding this bad boy knocked a few degrees off that and I couldn\u2019t be happier. The install was a breeze and the thermal paste in the box was good. Now I\u2019m running at better temps and I\u2019m pretty happy about it",
