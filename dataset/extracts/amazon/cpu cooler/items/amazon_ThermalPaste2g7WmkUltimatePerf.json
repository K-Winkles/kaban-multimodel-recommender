I needed a simple test to see it its performance is adequate for ordinary use. I used a Cinebench R23 benchmark. The test system was an Intel I3-10100 4C/8T @ 3.6 GHz processor with a Cooler Master i71 CPU cooling fan. The control was a graphite thermal pad proven to be nearly as good as the paste I use currently. With this humble system, the benchmark score and wattage used where virtually the same as expected without thermal throttling. The maximum temperature and fan speed showed real improvement. Thermal Pad Amgchiron PasteMaximum Temperature 71 deg C. 67 deg C. 5.6 % improvementMaximum Fan RPM 1229 rpm 1157 rpm 5.8 % improvementThis is much better cooling than I expected, and this appears to be a good product for the price.",

                "reviewText": "Thermal paste is designed to minimize microscopic air spaces and irregularities between the surface of the cooler and the CPU's integrated heat spreader. Having a good thermal paste is key because it allows the processor to transfer more of its waste heat to your cooler, keeping your processor running cool.The AMG Chiron Model: TG-070 has the following:1. Thermal Conductivity: 7.0 W/mk = Average/Weak. [The more thermal conductivity you have, the better]2. Composition: Silicone Based = Creates a messy application process and poor stability. I would prefer an aluminum/silver/ceramic based formula, that of course increases the cost. However, you don't want it drying up and cracking!3. Density: 2.6 g.cm^-3 = My paste was clumpy, indicating the shelf life (which is listed as 6 months) is pretty weak.Overall, when investing into a computer you want to ensure the longevity of the processor. Sure, if someone only uses a computer to check emails, this paste may as well do the trick, but why risk it. Invest in a better quality thermal paste.",

In performance, I notice no difference in temps on my 240mm AIO cooled 5600X compared to my normally used Noctua NT-H1. At under $4 (after coupon), it's a worthy thermal solution especially if you are one that needs to re-paste often.",
