The twin towers with their advanced cooling technology keep my CPU temperatures around 75\u00b0C on average, and under heavy load, it barely reaches 85\u00b0C. Installation was straightforward, thanks to its compatibility with both Intel and AMD sockets. The dual PWM fans are impressively quiet yet effective. For its price, this cooler is a great deal, offering top-notch cooling performance. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to keep their CPU cool efficiently.",

                "reviewText": "Excellent fan and heatsink setup! It was easy to install with my build. The temps are low and it is almost inaudible. Two things made it dicey: The size made hooking up power cables around it a little difficult and it overhangs the memory slots, so hook those up before the heatsink. Also you need access to the back of the motherboard for a support bracket and rails so it's good to install those before mounting the motherboard in the case. It looks really good and it is a quality addition which is excellent value for the money.",

                "reviewText": "I've been a proponent for AOIs for a long time. I had a NZXT x63liquid cooler for almost 3-4 yrs. And I installed an MSI liquid cooler in my son's PC build. That one was about 2.5 yrs old. I installed some Corsair light strips RGB set to monitor my son's CPU temperatures. Recently, I noticed my son's computer was off and he said he did not turn it off. When i turned it on, I noticed the RGB light strips turned red. I checked the CPU temp and it was through the roof.My sister had an extra NZXT x73 after the original one installed in her NZXT build FAILED (she bought a nicer one and NZXT send her a replacement x73 for the one that failed.) I got a new case and bought the X73 off her for cheap and installed it into my new case.I just built a new pc for hubby and one of the components I bought was the gray Peerless Assassin. I thought to myself, \"Self, do you want to install a cooler that is 'install it and forget it' or one that requires a bit more attention and if it fails, you won't know until the temps make the computer shut down?\" I decided for \"install it and forget it.\"When my son's AIO cooler failed, I had not installed the Assassin in hubby's build yet. So, I installed hubby's Assassin into my son's computer. Since hubby's build is a Christmas present, I ordered a 2nd Peerless Assassin (white). Those two computers are set! The temps stay cool and easy to clean/blow out when they get dusty. The motherboard RGB settings are set to CPU temps on all my builds. I will leave my computer alone for a couple years and probably get an Assassin for myself eventually because of the reliability. Hubby and I are not big on gaming, and my son does Flight Simulator on his pc. These coolers ROCK! The value for the money is awesome, and super easy to install, too. Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "Back story...and review.In 2019 I retired from the Navy and relocated to the Philippines. As a retirement give for myself I built a PC with some modest components purchased from Amazon. That included a MSI B450 Tomahawk mother board and a Ryzen 5 2600 CPU. The system worked great for my needs in stock configuration with no overclocking. A few months ago I experienced a problem I have never experienced. While encoding a video the computer just crashed. This happened a few times and through some troubleshooting I determined it was CPU heat related. I cleaned the fans and the problem sort of went away. My idle temperature still hovered between 45c and 50c. I decided two upgrades were in order...Change the CPU to the Ryzen 5 5600X and the Peerless Assassin 120 cooling solution over the wraith cooling included. Because of a Typhoon the CPU arrived almost two weeks before the cooler. So I installed the CPU with the wraith cooler to test.Encoding the same video so I could compare apples to apples here are the results:Wraith cooler: Minimum Temp 41.6C, Max Temp 81.5C, CPU 4.51GHZ, 194 FPS average.Peerless Assassin: Minimum Temp 38.4, Max Temp 59.1, CPU 4.62GHZ, 200 FPS average.Room ambient temperature is 25C and the the temperature inside my computer case during encoding reached 29.8CSide notes:The Peerless Assassin comes with Thermal Right TF7 thermal paste. However, I did not use. I chose to go with Gelid GC-4 thermal paste.I bought the white fan with the black case because no one sees it where it is located and the white version qualified for free shipping.Originally there were two intake and one exhaust fan in the computer. I have installed a second exhaust fan. All fans except the CPU are now controlled by Fan Control based on a CPU Temp curve.",

It was placed in a nr200 case which I had a AIO before but needed more space so tried this out and was pleased when I went in the bios to see temps under 50\u00b0, fan are silent enough but rpm is not as fast as the noctua fans and if you're not pushing too much load it's perfect for recording music and playing games overall it's a good deal \ud83e\udd1d",
