                "reviewText": "First off, I love ID Cooling Tower coolers, made by the same company who made THIS low profile cooler. However, this low profile cooler should be taken off the market.Here is why I bought this cooler and why I feel led astray.I ship custom built systems across the country for a bond trading firm. Regardless of shipper, I noticed I had a problem with all tower coolers. (This review is NOT on a tower cooler.) In tower coolers, fans are held in place by two springs that always come lose during shipping. Upon loosing the springs, the fan falls into the case. .The springs are hard to fish out, let alone mind-bending difficult to set back in place.If I were at these locations to where they are shipped, I could live with that issue. However, the brokers who get my machines CANNOT do this sort of work.The solution was to buy a low profile cooler that screws into a base plate mounted under the motherboard. Then the fan stays in place during rough shipping.I spent hours looking for CPU fans and reading all the reviews. Having impressive results with ID Cooling TOWER fans, which cooled my i3-12100 to 90 degrees F (also 30 degrees C), I figured I could trust the reviews on their low profile product.Building a computer is time consuming these days and there are a lot of wires to tuck in and clip together. It's a work of art, as shown in my photo.However, when I ran this machine with a low wattage of only 60w on an i3-12100, the idle temps went way above 40 degrees C and when I closed the case, it went up higher. And my work space is COLD.I also placed my fingers on the metal of the cooler while running, which felt cool, but the motherboard BIOS readings were alarmingly high. This means heat dissipation at the core was not efficient. More insulting, the free Intel cooler did a better job.What causes this issue remains to be seen. I did use high quality thermal grease instead of what came with the ID Cooling kit. The cooler did seem to screw down to the base firmly without any issues.I am guessing that this design needs COPPER at its core. And if that does not fix the issue, then something else is going on.Mind you, I had to take apart the computer and start over. I am annoyed with ID Cooling and although their other products might be excellent, they have now imbued me with distrust of what I buy from them going forward. This company specializes in cooling systems... they should know better.I authorized an Amazon return, which I stated that the product was NOT as claimed in its post.",

                "reviewText": "Pros:easy to install since fan is pre-installed; RGB; budget friendly only $18; may give 5-12 degrees improvement when compare to the stock cooler.Cons:thermal paste is not pre-applied; no copper base or heat pipe; not ARGB... hmm, I think usually cooler with all these features will not priced at this price, so maybe I am asking too much for a budget cooler :-)Summary:This is a low-profile CPU cooler that comes with RGB lights, it is a budget-friendly RGB cooler from a decent brand. I have seen a few tech YouTubers tested their other coolers and the performance were acceptable. This cooler looks durable, and the metal finishing is also of good quality.Based on my experience that if you're NOT planning to overclock and will be running multithreaded tasks continuously, this cooler should be even sufficient for i5 CPUs. I mean this is more like an improved LGA 1700 version of the DK-03i cooler that was previously released for LGA1200/115X, which had a TDP of only 100W. However, keep in mind that even the 12900 K has a TDP of 125W, which can increase to over 241W during high loads (Intel has set both PL1 and PL2 to 241W). Therefore, this cooler may not be the best choice if you're planning to run production work with multiple threads. Since there is no copper heat pipe or copper base, based on my experience, this cooler may only offer a slight (maybe a few degrees) improvement over the stock cooler.It's important to note that this cooler is not an ARGB, so you cannot adjust the RGB lighting. The fan comes pre-mounted to the aluminum heat sink, and although the thermal compound is not pre-applied, a small bag of thermal compound is included, which is enough for one application.",

                "reviewText": "This is by far the worst purchase i've ever made on amazon. There is NO install guide and even though it's listed as compatible with L1700 is doesn't install. not with the bracket included and not without it. So it's a waste. Can't even find an install guide or video for this model on the manufacturer's website. Save your money and get something that you don't have to be a rocket scientist to install.",
