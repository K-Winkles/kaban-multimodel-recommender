                "reviewText": "Price to performance is absolutely ridiculous...the cheapest AIO I have seen and some of the best performance I've seen...Only thing I think that may be better for the price is the Deepcool LT520/LS520 series coolers, but it's very, very close.I needed a cooler for this particular build that can be oriented in 2 different ways, one of which and the best orientation for airflow/cooling that would have the radiator mounted at the bottom. For the vast majority of AIOs this is a big no no as air will get caught in the highest point of the loop, which would be in the CPU block where most AIOs also have the Pump installed. This has the pump installed on the tubes close to the radiator making it totally safe for the radiator to be mounted on the bottom. So now , regardless of the orientation of the case, the AIO will work just as good without possibly compromising the pump.All things considered, versatility, performance, price, and looks, this is definitely high up on the list of best overall AIO liquid coolers.The fans come pre-installed on the radiator in exhaust orientation. Installation on AM5 was a breeze and used the clips already present on the motherboard to attach. Radiator mounts the same as any other.",

                "reviewText": "This AIO cooler is easy to install, and the tools included are good enough for a successful installation. However, if the fan can be daisy chained, it would be better. The supplied 4 pins splitter is in BLACK, they should include a white one instead where I ordered a white AIO.It is an interesting AIO, the pump is actually sits on the hose. The mirror RGB looks very nice. However, the fan is so loud since it always goes up to 80%. It is funny that the ideal temp fluctuated from 36-50 with 1-2% CPU usage. So, when it hit 50, the fan starts running. If you set the fan to run at lower speed, the temp will go up to a point that make the fan hit 80% again. Is the AIO working correctly? Yes, it does. I stressed test it with Cinebench. It always stays at 60-61 max. It is very interesting. Or did I do something wrong?BTW, I am using a 5600X.",
