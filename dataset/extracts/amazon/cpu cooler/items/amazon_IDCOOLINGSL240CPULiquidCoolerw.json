Instructions are straightforward, and mounting hardware is great quality.Individual ARGB fan and AIO cables, each with a splitter to daisy-chain ARGB devices, no included fan or ARGB hub.Cooling performance was on par with or better than NZXT and Corsair models due to the slightly larger than average 27mm AIO fans.Overall I give this 5/5 stars and have ordered many more of these, glad to have competition in the market.This is not a paid or sponsored ad.R5 Custom PCs",

I will say the pump was a bit noisy when I first installed it but after running my computer for a bit that noise went away. I mean if you comparing this to something like a NZXT Kraken 240. IMO this ID cooling AIO is the better deal, it got a larger display and the temps are pretty similar. I didn't give it 5 stars because the installation guide was not good, box did not have warranty info (had to go to their official website to check) and no directions for the install of the AIO display software (again went to ID Cooling's official site to download that as well). Other than that I didn't experience any of the issues like some of the other reviews have, all in all a solid AIO.",

I love the fan ring design of this, but this was built to be a quiet machine and the crickets break that intent.Update: On the 4th day it just completely stopped working. The cricket noises were the pump already struggling to exist and it gave it out quickly then. Zero RPM reporting to the motherboard sensor or noise coming from the unit now.",

                "reviewText": "First off I love the look and functionality of this AIO. Fits my theme perfectly. Love how you can put whatever picture you want, as long as it's the correct format, and can even load in gifs. I like the options it gives you for what you can monitor, but sadly I can't get it to read GPU temp. It recognizes that it's there, but can't get any data unfortunately.But, this thing whines like the supercharger on my A7. It has gotten quieter since initial install, I don't know if like some lube in a motor bearing needs to be moved around, air trapped in the pump originally, not sure. As of right now, when you turn the PC on it has a split second whine of the pump whipping up then goes away, and you can hear it gurgling if you put your head close to the glass (my PC is on the floor). At PC idle you can slightly hear the gurgle, but when the fans spin up from a game, that noise drowns it out. Has me a bit worried about the longevity of the pump, I might try reaching out to ID Cooling. Also I probably should have taken a video.",

The screen is sharp and the firmware/app supporting it has abundant features, including rotating the screen based on how you installed the head, so the display is always upright.Highly recommend this AIO, as well as the ID-Cooling Brand. I have also used their Air coolers, and those are equally high quality and good performing.",
