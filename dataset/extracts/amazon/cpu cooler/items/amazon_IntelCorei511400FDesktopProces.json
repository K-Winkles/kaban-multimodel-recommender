For having 6 cores it surprised me how well it performs on FPS games, does better than many 8 Core CPUs . This i5-11400f seems very snappy with Decent frame rates at 1080p and 1440. Maybe a perfect match for an Nvidia 3060 gpu or Radeon 6700 gpu or Maybe an Intel Arc A750 gpu. This CPU is not Top Teir Cutting edge but if you are building an entry level 1080p Gaming pc like i was or maybe a mid tier 1440p gaming setup and limited on funds this Cpu could be a nice Option.",

Be aware that this chip does not have built in graphics, so you'll need one.This worked perfect for my budget build I did with my son for his first gaming PC. You can't overclock it, but it does max out at 4.4 GHz and the 6 cores makes it work faster than I expected. Paired with a decent GPU and this chip is more than enough for a decent system.",

Only using gen 3 m.2 but 20 seconds to boot is nothing to sneeze at. FPS between it and the i7 are about 10% less I cannot really see a difference in gameplay never have a stutter on Horde night on 7dtd. Very happy with this. I was gonna sell this rig but I can.t seem to part ways with it now.",
