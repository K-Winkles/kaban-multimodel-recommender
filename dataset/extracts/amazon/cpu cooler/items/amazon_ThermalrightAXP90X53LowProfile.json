                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Decent Cooler, Terrible Installation",
                "reviewText": "I'm just adding on to what many others already said; I had a poor experience with mounting the cooler. The instructions weren't difficult to understand, but it felt finicky to place the heat sink on the CPU, turn the motherboard upside-down, then install the backplate. I could not tell if I mounted it evenly, and I was reluctant to tighten the nuts since I didn't want to over-torque them and potentially damage the socket.The backplate has \"AM4\" on one side and \"LGA1200/1700\" on the other; according to the instructions, the side you see should match your motherboard socket. I was installing this to an ASRock LGA1200 motherboard, but the LGA1200 orientation did not work because the motherboard had obstructions to the backplate, so I ended up using the AM4 side with the longer screws designed for it. Weird, but this issue seems to be somewhat common.Once I got past the issue of installing the cooler and saw how it performed, I was satisfied with the result. Admittedly, I'm using a 65W TDP CPU (i5-11400F) so it's not hard to cool, but the fan's noise profile is excellent. It's near silent under 1900 rpm, and pleasant until it goes over 2300 rpm. As for cooling, it had no problem keeping my CPU from thermal throttling during a 10 minute Cinebench R23 stress test (it never hit 80\u00b0C).Overall, it's a good CPU cooler at a decent price if you can stomach the installation process. I would only recommend getting this for cases with less than 67mm cooler clearance as I would very much prefer to use the cheaper Thermalright Assassin X120/Assassin King, or slightly more expensive Thermalright AXP120-X67.",

                "reviewText": "Please heed the install warnings you see about this product from other reviewers.Due to poorly written install instructions and odd mounting system I wound up using the heat sink that came with my cpu which was around the same height.You are required to reverse mount the cooler, screwing from the back of the motherboard instead of the front, this is not ideal as you won't be able to tell if you are missing thermal contact; Trying to keep the heat sink slotted while doing this is dicey and the plate they give you can lend to you tightening to the point of bending your motherboard.I would skip this and find something else, unless you want a challenge.",

                "reviewText": "this cooler is being used on an asus Prime Q370M-C/CSM with a i9-9900k cpu. I bought this to do a simple build in a small form factor pc. I'm not overclocking or doing anything crazy. Just general workstation with the occasional movie conversions via handbrake. Again, i'm not doing anything crazy and wanted to stay as simple as possible whilst doing better than a stock intel cooler.The good: it has a low profile, quiet, and in use seems to be effective.The bad: the absolute WORST mounting solution imaginable, PERIOD! even someone with experience could damage their motherboard by over-torquing the mounting nuts. I can't even be certain i'm getting proper even contact with the cpu because the cooler stand-offs don't contact the board. it just kinda 'floats' on the cpu while being bolted to the board. and there really isn't any insulation between the metal backing plate and the traces of the motherboard, so that could theoretically cause issues.upon boot-up and going into the bios, my cpu was idling at around 95f, so it's doing something. I've gotta install the OS and try to see how well it'll do under use. I'm sure in that regard it's definitely more than adequate. I just don't believe saving the $20-$40 over a nactua or bequiet is worth potentially damaging important components like the motherboard. If you're not overclocking, i'd say you might as well save even more money and just use a stock intel cooler, otherwise pony-up and go with a more well-known enthusiast/professional brand like the aforementioned nactua or bequiet.update: this thing is terrible.. it might work if it had a good mounting solution so one could tighten it down properly without risk of damaging the other components, but..i installed linux mint on a i9-9900k based asus motherboard. i wanted to test out how well handbrake worked. not thinking anything of it i tried rendering a movie. it started out at a decent rate but within less than 2 minutes, the rendering fps were less than halved due to thermal throttling. the case is completely open. i felt around the underside of the cooler and the cpu was waaay too hot to the touch.so, i'm gonna try and send this back.. hope this helps someone make a decision",
