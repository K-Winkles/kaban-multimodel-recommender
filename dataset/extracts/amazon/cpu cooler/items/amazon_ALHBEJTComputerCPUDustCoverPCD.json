I though this would be obvious but based on some of the reviews i read I think it should be stated just in case you didn\u2019t know\u201d You put this on when the computer is off to prevent it from getting dust which is honestly probably when a lot dust gets in there***It fits pretty well and has the open back portion for your wires to pass through. It\u2019s very easy to fold back up if you follow the original out of package folds (which is super convenient)I would definitely recommend this product if you live in an area where you get a lot of dust or have pets.",
