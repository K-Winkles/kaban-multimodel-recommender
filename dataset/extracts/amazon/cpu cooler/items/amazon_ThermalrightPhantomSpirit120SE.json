                "reviewText": "Just completed my first new PC build in ages. My build is an i5-12600k with an ASRock Z690 Pro RS motherboard. The entire time I was planning my build, I assumed I would go Noctua for my CPU cooler, because what reasonable person would do anything less? Well, I am so glad I bought the Phantom Spirit instead of the Noctua NH-U12S redux I was originally going to buy.Not only did a I save a ton of money, but I got way, WAY better cooling than I would have with the NH-U12S. I can't believe how well this thing works. For the record, I don't overclock, and I have my PL1/PL2 power limits set to the factory defaults for my 12600k. However, stress testing with Prime95 results in temps that never exceed 67 C! Incredible.It was easy to install, no fuss!It is also completely silent under normal conditions. Could not be happier! I rarely write reviews, but this one is so worth it.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this cooler as it rated extremely well in benchmarking from several reviewers I trust. In many ways this is an updated Thermalright Peerless Assassin, but at a better price. I am using this with a 5800x3D which has a tendency to spike the thermals very briefly but pretty aggressively under certain loads from time to time.I have quite a bit of experience building PCs and didn't find installing this cooler to be any trouble. The mounting brackets and process was pretty typical for a modern air cooler with no surprises. I found the directions to be good as well. I am using an all air cooled system in a Fractal Torrent Compact case. I previously had a Deep Cool AK620 in my system, and while it worked well enough, the temps were a little higher than I ideally wanted and it could get a little loud under heavier game loads.I'm happy to report that the cooler seems to live up to expectations. My temps have improved about 3-4C on average, the brief max temp spikes the 5800x3D likes to do are better controlled as well with a max temp for a split second here and there of about 84C (vs close to 90C before with the AK620). The average temps in my system hold around 75-80C under heavy game loads and tends to idle in the 50s under general usage. Not as impressive as water cooling, but considering this is an air cooler at a very good price I am pretty happy with the results. I haven't tested all the top coolers to speak with total authority, but of the 3 coolers I have tried this is the best one so far for my used case (gaming).Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a cost effective option that can provide top performance for an air cooler!",

The mounting hardware was a breeze to install. It's nice how far that kind of thing has come over the years, and compared to previous builds, this was super convenient. The other nice thing, which threw me off initially, was that this had the fans detached from the main heatsink. At first I thought it was an extra hassle, but when I started attaching the fans, I realized one had to be mounted about an inch above flush with the heatsink, because of the memory modules standing up from the motherboard. Luckily, the brackets had a design that allowed me to do that without a second thought. So yeah, very good hardware all around.",

This cooler does take up a lot of space, though the fans can easily be adjusted to clear RAM height if necessary. Great performance for the price if you don't mind the size!",

                "reviewText": "The Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120SE is the best budget and the best performing air cooler as of now. Previously owning the DeepCool Assassin IV,Noctua NH-D15, and Noctua NH-D15S this easily wins especially for the price. I am currently running a 7950x3D w/ stock fans and have never seen the CPU jump past 70c with any game I played (unlocked framerate). I have tried CS2, Fortnite, Warzone 2, The Finals, PUBG, and Apex Legends without any overheating. If you are thinking about this brand/CPU cooler, there is a reason why you are here. Buy this CPU cooler and you won't regret it.",

                "reviewText": "I've been a fan of Thermalright ever since I got of their Assassin X back then. I tested my Assassin X on my Ryzen 5600g then Ryzen 5700x. It reaches 152F-159F (67C-69C) while testing it through Prime95. It's hot and humid here so that's good for a cheap Thermalright fan. I bought this Phantom Spirit 120 SE because of good reviews.I then replaced it with this Phantom Spirit 120 SE. Testing it again through Prime95 gives me 143F (62C) max which is a good temp decrease. Online reviews said the fans on it is quiet but I don't really care about it.The only downside that I had was that I need to move the front fan a bit higher because of my RAM. I think it's just because of my mobo being mATX which means the RAM slots are closer to my CPU.If you have bigger PC case and Mobo, you need to buy the Phantom Spirit 120 non-SE. It's newer and looks better on the top. Also it has better metal backplate vs plastic on SE version. Also better fins which probably can get better temps though just by a bit, maybe a degree or two. It's still nearly same price as of SE version. I just picked the SE version as it is shorter in height.",
