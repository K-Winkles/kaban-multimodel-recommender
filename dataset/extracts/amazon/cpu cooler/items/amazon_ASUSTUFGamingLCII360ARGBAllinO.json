                "reviewText": "I chose this AOI cooler because it fits the Asus GT301 case in a top mount configuration (even this it's not supposed to). CPU temps are significantly cooler than stock Wraith cooler. My 5700G is purring now since it holds it's boost clocks much longer than before. It's also allowed my GPU to drop a few degrees since the heat is directed out the case and not blowing around. Extremely quiet even when fans are at their highest level. The mounting bracket isn't as bad as people make it out to be and the heatsink is bigger than the picture makes it look. Just be careful when installing it. My hand slipped and the copper face scratched extremely easily. At least it was in a spot that didn't matter. I just used the pre-applied thermal paste and it seems to do the job with no problems. Very happy with this purchase overall.Note: my radiator came with a small dent (hidden under the fans) and the thermal paste looks like it might of been pre-applied twice (can see the edge of a second circle) so I'm not sure if what I got was exactly 'brand new' however, everything seems to be working fine and these are seller issues... not a product issue.",

                "reviewText": "I didn't expect this to be the best cooler I've used, but I expected to not have my Intel i9 12000k hitting 105 degrees instantly on heavy load. I know that this chip runs hot, which is why I invested in an AIO, but these temps are not sustainable for long processing loads. The chip isn't thermal throttling, but it gets close. I've also removed and reapplied my own thermal paste which helped to reduce temps by about 5 degrees, but still not enough for me to be comfortable. After under-volting my CPU, I was able to bring the temps down to around 90 degrees Celsius with minimum impact on the performance, but that shouldn't be necessary to keep temps under 100.The display is the coolest part of this AIO and the iCue software makes customizing it extremely easy with endless variability. There are two modes for Corsair controlled hardware, whatever you configured and the device hardware default. Whenever the PC is locked or booting up/shutting down, the hardware defaults will kick in. Those defaults can be configured in the iCue software as well. Those defaults however only apply to the RBG, not the cooling and fan modes.All in all, one of the coolest AIOs on the market, but may consider looking elsewhere if you have a 12000k.",

This CPU cooler installed in about 30 minutes and performs very well. I did add extra heat sink paste to the face of the cooler before before mounting it to the CPU. Although this is not absolutely necessary.",

I am experiencing a core max of 59c after gaming for 4 hours (after running for 72 hours) with an ambient temp of 78F. This cools better than my corsair h100i v2 in the same case. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good all in one cooling solution! I will update this review should any problems arise with this cooler.",
