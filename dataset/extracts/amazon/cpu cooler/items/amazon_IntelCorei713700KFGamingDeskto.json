                "reviewText": "The Intel Core i7-13700KF presents a compelling value proposition for its price. As part of Intel's 13th Gen \"Raptor Lake\" series, it boasts a robust 8 Performance-core (P-core) and 8 Efficient-core (E-core) configuration, mirroring the previous-gen flagship i9-12900K but at a more accessible price point\u200b\u200b. This configuration, coupled with updates like larger L2 caches for P-cores and improved cache hardware-prefetchers, contributes to its outstanding performance.In terms of raw performance, the i7-13700KF demonstrates commendable prowess. It outperforms the 12th gen flagship Core i9-12900K in single and multi-core tests, albeit marginally, and shows significant performance gains over its direct predecessor, the Core i7-12700K, with a 12% and 32.5% lead in single-core and multi-core tests, respectively\u200b\u200b. When compared to competitors like the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X and Ryzen 9 5950X, the i7-13700KF shows a remarkable 23% and 25% single-core performance bump, and an even more impressive 67% and 15% lead in multi-core performance against these AMD chips\u200b\u200b.However, buyers should be aware that the Core i7-13700KF does not come with integrated graphics. For users who require onboard video capabilities, the slightly higher-priced Core i7-13700K would be the best choice. The absence of integrated graphics in the 13700KF model can be a significant consideration for those who don't plan to use a dedicated graphics card.The i7-13700KF stands out as an excellent choice for its price, offering high-end performance that rivals even some flagship models from the previous generation. Its value is particularly notable when considering its performance metrics against direct competitors and predecessors",

                "reviewText": "Intel is killing the competition. If you want an insanely fast PC, make this the heart of it. Or if you\u2019re really feeling it go for an i9. I would recommend staying within the 13th generation as there\u2019s not much about the 14th gen that makes it worth it. Out of the box this CPU will comfortably run at 5.4ghz, it performs amazing under load and in my system stays perfectly cool.This year-old CPU, blows away brand new CPU\u2019s from the likes of Apple and AMD, I truly cannot recommend the 13th gen lineup enough, this being the centerpiece of it all.If you do get an LGA 1700 CPU, go ahead and get the bracket upgrade for your MOBO, it\u2019ll save you time down the long run and helps to keep temps in check.",
