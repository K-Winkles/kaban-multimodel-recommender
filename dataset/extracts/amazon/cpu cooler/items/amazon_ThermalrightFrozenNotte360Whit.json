Switched from an NZXT Kraken 120 which had only 1 120mm fan but was somehow a little more expensive. CPU temps are consistently lower on the new cooler. The pump is also way too quiet to hear over the fans. Only small gripe is that all the fans have their own rgb and fan connectors so cable management isn\u2019t fun. But I was able to make it work without too much hassle. Buy this cooler if you haven\u2019t already!!!",

Aesthetics speak for themselves, this thing is beautiful. Temps are great as well.Only complaint is that my fans came already attached to the PC, but they were backwards for some reason? Luckily a very easy fix.For those complaining about the loud fans, please make sure you are putting your fans on the right header on your motherboard. I had the same issue and switched things around with my case fans, and it was completely silent. Amazing cooler, best thing you can get for the price!",
