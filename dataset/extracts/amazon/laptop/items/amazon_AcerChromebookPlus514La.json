The Chromebook itself is very sturdy, great build quality. Good speakers and like all Chromebooks, easy to set up with your google account. I did my research and decided that google plus is the way to go. More memory, faster processor and decent resolution. 14\u201d screen is perfect for my needs. I hope to get many years use out of the Chromebook. Great for young students and internet browsing with some added features.",
