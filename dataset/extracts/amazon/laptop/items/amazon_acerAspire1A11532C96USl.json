                "reviewText": "I bought this laptop for writing and taking online classes primarily, and it's just perfect. Keyboard is nice to use. Screen is bright and crisp. Laptop is lightweight.This is NOT a laptop for gaming, video editing, demanding graphics work, and you're probably going to get frustrated if you are a busy, multi-tasker with multiple software and dozens of browser tabs open at the same time.That being said, for basic computing needs (word processing, watching Netflix, web browsing, blogging, writing a novel, taking classes, etc...), this laptop is near perfect and budget-friendly.Couple Notes: - The processor is 1.1 ghz, not 2.8 as listed in description, but really, you wouldn't be doing anything on this that should ever require that much processor speed. - Memory is upgradeable, which is nice, but I've found that 4gb is fine for what I'm using it for right now. - Laptop looks stylish, but lacks that \"high-end\" feel - but it's a $200 laptop. Still, I like it and keyboard feels good for typing at length. - Screen is sharp. Colors are decent. Not the best screen out there, of course, but certainly not bad at all. Not a touch screen...slight bummer but not a big deal to me. - Sound coming from speakers is nice and loud. No, not premium sound, but sufficient to watch movies/video classes and hear it just fine. I'm happy with it, but no audiophile. Use headphones or a Bluetooth speaker if you want better sound. - Performance has been fast and I've been satisfied. - Easy to switch from Windows S to full Windows Home, which is my preference and why I opted for this over a Chromebook. - 81gb of available storage space after OS and apps take up a bit of the 128 gb drive. To me, that's totally fine since I'm not saving anything on this - it all goes in the cloud. - I don't think the battery will actually last 9 hours with normal settings, but I get a solid 5 or so hours out of it between charges.RE: Slowness/Lagginess:A couple negative reviews mentioned this and when it happened to me, I thought that maybe there WAS something off about this computer.Turns out when I logged into my Microsoft account, it started syncing my existing desktop computer with this laptop, and with only 4gb of memory and slower processor, it just bogged it right down for about 20 minutes or so as it synced apps, desktop icons, etc.... Once everything synced up, it was fine and has been ever since.So if you experience slow, laggy performance when you first get this, and you've logged into your Microsoft account, set it down and let it sync for 20 minutes or so, or better yet, adjust the sync settings to be more selective.All in all, it's a great, inexpensive laptop that is super lightweight, super portable, looks nice, performs great, and is perfect for basic computing, an older child/teen, college courses, etc...",

                "reviewText": "I love this computer! Here's why... I wanted a portable computer that I could use for getting information from the web and for typing documents. I saw this computer and figured that for the price I couldn't go wrong. I was more right than I imagined.First thing was to get rid of that Windowa S. Installed Linux Mint 21.2 and my favorite (and ONLY) office suite Softmaker Office 2024. For typing/editing documents this system is incredible. It is as light as a Chromebook, runs forever (8+ hours) on a full charge, has a very sharp display (I have bad vision so this was important), decent sound (great with bluetooth headset :)) and a good enough keyboard that I can type at a reasonable speed. With Microsoft Edge (yeah, I love the Edge browser) and the Brave browser I have no problem finding the information I need. All-in-all this computer is ideal for what I needed to do. I have already shown it to a couple of people with the same needs as me. One of the best purchases I have made in a long time!!!One thing that I did do was get a tiny 64 GB USB drive and make it my primary working storage. That way I wear out a throwaway device instead of my eMMC which probably isn't replaceable.Finally, small reality check. This IS NOT a computer for playing games. Not even simple ones. Hearts or solitaire or Minesweeper should be okay, but graphics games are just going to be a non-starter. I got mine for research and writing and for that it is perfect. But, its just not a gaming machine.And, considering how inexpensive it is, for me it just doesn't get any better.BTW, I own several other computers (mostly Acer) with Linux, Windows and ChromeOS. I am writing this review ON the computer I am reviewing. This is the computer I use most of the time, and the one that goes with me.",
