Needed it for video editing and while I haven't gotten to use it yet, I was recommended this laptop for this very reason. Compared to my last laptop I bought in 2010, which was also $1200 that weighted 15 lbs, this is a massive improvement.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this without finding any reviews online. Here's my take. This laptop is light, thin and has great battery life with web browsing. It doesn't get too warm with day to day tasks, it can sit on your lap without cooking it which is something many gaming laptops can't do. It charges over usb-c and the 150w power brick (not usb-c) is small. Overall performance is great for the size.Updated Review: Turning off \"Smooth edges of images and text\" In Windows made a difference in text readability.But the screen is the weakest part. It's \"okay.\" Just bright enough but I wish it was brighter. It's rated at 250 nits (though it feels a bit brighter), at 1920x1080, 45% ntsc. Colors are good enough but aren't amazing. Viewing angles are okay. It's decent and usable, not horrible but I expect better. If you come a laptop with a great screen this will be a noticeable step down. I did get used to it over time but there were times when I was in a bright room that I wished the laptop was just a bit brighter. Response time is fine.The 4060 doesn't have a mux switch and is capped at 80w. Performance was more inline with a higher powered 4050 out of the box. With tweaking you can get it to low-end 4060 levels.",
