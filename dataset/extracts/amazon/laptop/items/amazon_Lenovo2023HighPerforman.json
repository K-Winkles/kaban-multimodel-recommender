                "reviewText": "Bought this for one of our boys after his $900 laptop died (bad motherboard) after 2 years. What a great deal and perfect for his high school work. The size is small enough to easily carry in his backpack and large enough that he won't get eye strain! Impressed with the quality. Would not know it was refurbished - looks brand new. Runs Windows 11 and Office 360 without a problem. I've been in I.T. for a lot of years and dealt with most brands and IMHO would say Lenovo is probably one of the most consistent quality units. After this experience I won't hesitate to go refurbished again. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Sent to an overseas family member who wanted a laptop with a bigger screen, so it wasn't for me and I couldn't spend more time with it or take pictures. I was also a bit hesitant in buying this as Amazon doesn't say what exact model of laptop this is, but I believe this is a Lenovo Ideapad 3i? If I'm correct, that laptop can cost up to $500 when not on sale. Compare that to this refurb around $250. A refurb Windows laptop at this price range in 2023 is a pretty good value. Anyways, the family member loved this laptop. This is not a low tier Windows laptop by any means. Expect it to handle multitasking for school and business tasks, but don't expect too much power for 3D apps or crystal clear audio from the speaker.",
