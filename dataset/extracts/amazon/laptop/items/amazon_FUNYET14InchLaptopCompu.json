                "reviewText": "Ladies and gents, saddle up because today has been an emotional ride. I bought this laptop with the intent to use it for work. I need to be able to access 9 websites, check my email, and run numbers. Pretty simple stuff that I\u2019m after. It arrived today. Unoboxing was painfully simple. The user manual is all but useless, in my humble opinion. There were multiple updates to be had.. which is to be expected as I can only assume the computer is actually a couple of years old despite this being its first use outside of the quality control diagnostics. Y\u2019all. I was on Amazon chat for an hour and a half, 6 different agents, and no assistance in my issue. This is advertised as included with Windows 11 Pro. I had to call Microsoft and be walked through how to locate the key associated with the device only to discover my product key had already be used on a DIFFERENT DEVICE and was no longer available for my use, despite my paying for it. My new laptop wanted me to pay for a $200+ licensed product key despite it being sold to me with 11 Pro included. I got lucky and the rep with Microsoft support was able to get my Windows activated.Please read and learn from my misfortune.Aside from that huge hiccup upon receiving and set up, I\u2019m now logged into all of my accounts and am very excited to have a computer that I\u2019ve never written a high school essay on. Note there is no Ethernet access, no CD/DVD ROM, nor does it have a full sized HDMI port. These aren\u2019t deal breakers for me simply because this computer was bought for work purposes opposed to personal.I\u2019m very impressed by how light it is, the backlit keyboard, the fingerprint sensor, number pad, and the screen quality. For the price, this full sized laptop didn\u2019t skimp on user friendly design features.Computer itself: 9/10Setup: 0/10Amazon Support: everyone but Mustafa(10), 0/10Microsoft Support: 11/10*Updated Review*Since receiving contact from the company in question, I\u2019d like to state I\u2019m please with their customer service and support. They reached out and were willing to right their wrongs. Upon reflection, I have updated my review as my laptop functions above expectation and allows me to do everything I require for my work and it was also reasonably priced considering its features.",

                "reviewText": "I love the quality of this laptop so much the screen quality and it works super fast! The laptop is nice and big and it\u2019s nothing like the super slow laptops that take 20 years to load and log you in. Some of the things that make it a four star not a five star is that if you want to use it for longer periods of time you need to have it plugged in the whole time because the battery life is at most like 2.5-3 hours which isn\u2019t as good compared to other laptops that have some battery life\u2019s lasting almost 7-8 hours. The battery save helps a little bit but it doesn\u2019t do as much as you think. The next thing that I don\u2019t like is that when the computer dies or you shut it down the updates take a lot of time even getting to almost 45 minutes and that\u2019s might not seem to bad but for kids that takes quite a bit. Overall this laptop was very nice and it\u2019s pretty good but some of the little things need a bit of tweaking but other than that it\u2019s a pretty good product",

Even as a 14\u201d, screen and keyboard makes it so easy to use and it's very light.We generally use it for only for web searches but the 8 gB RAM and 256 gB SSD makes it wicked fast. And the price (which includes Win 11 Pro), well there is really nothing else out there that can compare. I\u2019d recommend this as a utility or backup laptop, especially for younger families (vs a Chromebook).",
