                "reviewText": "Es una pasada de monitor gamer. El m\u00edo es la revisi\u00f3n A3.Cansado ya de los colores de mi antiguo Asus VG248QE, al principio pensaba en un IPS, pero tras investigar los problemas que tienen y ver los precios, volv\u00ed a investigar los paneles TN. Se hablaba muy bien de este monitor, que por cierto es poco conocido, pero no fue hasta que lo vi con mis propios ojos que entend\u00ed que hay paneles TN y PANELES TN. Esto es una maravilla, los colores no tienen nada que ver con mi monitor antiguo, no sufren ninguna degradaci\u00f3n al ir subiendo la frecuencia y con un perfil ICC (imprescindible pon\u00e9rselo) es una delicia para los ojos, m\u00e1s que suficiente a no ser que te dediques muy profesionalmente a fotograf\u00eda, edici\u00f3n gr\u00e1fica y dem\u00e1s. Unos negros geniales y el blanco muy homog\u00e9neo. Los \u00e1ngulos de visi\u00f3n son los t\u00edpicos de un buen TN, pero para m\u00ed ning\u00fan problema con esto.Con la resoluci\u00f3n 2560x1440 y esta calidad, es una gozada para las tareas t\u00edpicas, navegar por internet y dem\u00e1s, pero por supuesto donde se le saca partido es con videojuegos. Os pod\u00e9is imaginar, entre la resoluci\u00f3n, los colores, el tama\u00f1o, nada de lag... es una maravilla. El G-Sync se nota bastante, por ejemplo con juegos de coches todos los movimientos son mucho m\u00e1s suaves y sin tirones que con mi antiguo Asus, parece como grabado con una c\u00e1mara m\u00e1s que un videojuego, todo es fluido independientemente de si es complicada o no la escena, es una senaci\u00f3n muy agradable. Tambi\u00e9n lo he usado para edici\u00f3n fotogr\u00e1fica a nivel aficionado y ya os digo, la fidelidad de los colores es muy buena para no ser un monitor dedicado profesionalmente a ello, de sobra para cualquier persona normal, y el tama\u00f1o y la resoluci\u00f3n son geniales para visualizar fotos de alta resoluci\u00f3n.F\u00edsicamente hablando, viene muy bien embalado y es f\u00e1cil de montar. La est\u00e9tica est\u00e1 trabajada, es elegante. El marco no sobresale del plano de la pantalla y es muy fino, quedando muy chulo. Se puede regular en altura, en \u00e1ngulo, rotar en el plano vertical (girar la pantalla para ponerla en formato vertical) y rotar en el plano horizontal (girarlo sobre la base). Base estable y elegante. El monitor no hace ruido el\u00e9ctrico ni nada raro. Los men\u00fas y sus botones no son lo mejor del mundo, pero tampoco es algo que uso mucho. Tuve la ma\u00f1a suerte de tener un pixel muerto, aunque con tanta resoluci\u00f3n es dif\u00edcil verlo. Incluye cable usb 3.0 (tiene puertos en la propia pantalla) y cable DP bastante largo.La verdad es que estoy muy contento con la relaci\u00f3n calidad-precio. Es todo lo que puedo necesitar, gastarse m\u00e1s son ya o monitores muy profesionales o cosas como el \"quiero y no puedo\" que est\u00e1 ocurriendo con los IPS gamer. Este monitor est\u00e1 muy currando y aunque no incluye nada super revolucionario tiene muy pulido todo lo que hab\u00eda exist\u00eda hasta ahora. Es pura calidad, lo compras y a disfrutar, no te va a dar ning\u00fan problema. Eso s\u00ed, fundamental descargarse un perfil ICC de internet (yo tengo un calibrador, pero tengo que admitir que el resultado no cambia casi nada comparando con los perfiles de internet) porque ser\u00eda una pena no tenerlo funcionando al 100 %",

                "reviewDate": "Reviewed in the United Kingdom on September 30, 2016",
                "reviewTitle": "Brilliant monitor, excels in both the big features and the smaller ones.",
                "reviewText": "A few points to note before I go into this review:- I only have experience of TN panel monitors, so I'm not going to be able to compare it to IPS or any other form of display currently available.- I bought this monitor after refunding an ASUS ROG PG248Q, which was faulty on arrival with backlight bleed and suffered stuck pixels (surprise surprise).- This monitor (at least the one I was given) is the latest revision, the A03 (assembled in June 2016).Anyway, this is a fantastic monitor, that I highly recommend for anyone with the PC hardware to get the most out of it. I did a lot of research before going for this monitor, and I feel that a lot of reviews (both professional and consumers) don't talk about the smaller positives of this monitor over its competitor, so i'm going to try to include those too.For reference, these are the important PC specs I run for this monitor and gameplay at 1440p.- CPU: i5 4690K, overclocked to 4.5Ghz and watercooled.- GPU: MSI GTX 1070 Gaming X 8GB.- RAM: 16GB, 2400Mhz HyperX Fury.- PSU: 850W EVGA 80+ Gold.PROS:- Stunning image quality. Going from 24\" 1080p to 27\" 1440p is like going from a TV to a cinema screen. Honestly the increased resolution makes everything on the screen really pop. From just your desktop wallpaper to games it is a real visual revolution. In games such as Hitman and GTA V I sometimes feel I could reach out and touch things on the screen, it just has such a high visual clarity. Also, in terms of desktop space, if you come from 1080p, you'll have so much space you won't know what to do with most of it!- G-Sync is a thing of beauty. Honestly I was skeptical as to what G-Sync really did, and you can read as many reviews as you like, but you won't truly understand its advantages until you have it. Ever have those moments in games when the game can hitch or stutter briefly, maybe when you're moving at high speeds or heading into new areas? I had those...until G-Sync came along and eliminated them. Period. G-Sync will also smooth over that transition to 1440p, you may drop to 40-50fps at times in intensive games, but G-Sync will make it almost unnoticeable.- 144hz needs to become the new standard. You may think that 60hz is all you'll ever need, afterall 60fps is what we mainly aim for in game performance. However, 144hz just gives that butter smooth feel to everything, and it doesn't need to be games. Even just browsing the web or navigating your desktop, the 144hz makes mouse movements glide, and feel super responsive. Going back to 60hz, you can notice that loss in smoothness. 144fps in games is not as revolutionary, but in some situations you can feel that smooth movement here and there.- The monitors build quality is fantastic. Every piece of the monitor is sturdy, and you can feel that quality to each piece, from the base, the stand through to the panel itself. The thin bezel around the display is very sleek and minimalist, the stand is easily assembled, no tools required. No part of this monitor really feels flimsy. There is a small issue with the buttons, but i'll get to that in cons.- The stand is minimalist and not over-designed. Going from the ASUS ROG Swift variety of monitor, I can categorically say that ASUS are trying too hard to be edgy or gamer-y. The ROG Swift stand is all angular for no reason, the red LED ring around the stand is more of a distraction than something appealing (I turned it off for the short time I had it), and the stand that holds the monitor itself is built like an over sized tree trunk. I have my monitors slightly higher than where I sit, and so I have to set the monitor to lie a little lower on its vertical axis. With the ASUS this meant that the giant tree trunk stand stuck out over the back and it was really unappealing. With the DELL, the stand is minimalist, easy to adjust and keeps itself hidden as much as it can. It looks 100x better on a desktop than an ASUS Swift does. I applaud DELL for making a gaming monitor that remains clean and understated in its design, this edgy gaming design that ASUS and ACER are pursuing is (in my opinion) a bit of an insult, as it makes gamers seem like we are kids that like flashy lights and think that Michael Bay's Transformers are the best thing ever.- This monitor needs no external power bricks. Unlike the ASUS PG248Q which I had, this monitor (which is bigger and has the same features) does not have any external power brick to worry about when wiring it up. It uses a simple kettle style power lead and therefore much easier to wire up and fit into any tight spaces.- Quality Control, Quality Control. Buying an ASUS monitor (which in the case of gaming monitors is the big competitor, alongside ACER) IS a lottery. You might think that the QC lottery idea has been inflated and exaggerated by the internet, and that it wont happen to you. I also thought that, but lo-and-behold, I have bought 1 ASUS ROG Swift monitor and I have had that 1 monitor be faulty. These monitors are expensive, they are a big investment for us and to have such poor QC is unforgivable in my opinion. As I have previously mentioned the PG248Q I had (which is a brand new line from ASUS) had backlight bleed and suffered from stuck pixels straight out of the box. In comparison, I have only needed to have 1 DELL S2716DG sent to me, and it has been perfect from day one. Every monitor has the chance to go wrong, but in the case of ASUS ROG Swift monitors I would say you're more likely to have a faulty one than a perfect one from the box.- If you (like me) are doing a direct comparison between the S2716DG and the ASUS PG278Q and are weighing up some of the differences, connectivity can be an important factor. The ASUS PG278Q only gives you a single DP port, whereas this monitor offers a little more flexibility in giving you 1 DP port and 1 HDMI port. Though as other reviews will remind you, you must use the DP port to take advantage of 144hz and G-Sync.- In reference to the anti-glare, that some people bring up when speaking of this monitor. I do not notice any of it. Maybe I don't have the hawk eyes that some people do, or maybe its because I play in a fairly dimly lit room, but I see no issue with it whatsoever.- Colours. This part of a monitor (in my opinion) is completely subjective. Everyone has their preferences to how they like to view colours. I personally do not enjoy colours being too dark, or rich if that's the better word. I like to be able to pick out details in shadows and darker areas of games. For me, this monitor gives me amazing colours. As I stated to begin with I have never used IPS so I cannot compare, but from the experiences of a BENQ 1080p monitor I moved from, and the ASUS ROG PG248Q I used for a while, this monitor is in a different league for colours. Everything looks brilliant and I havn't even messed with any colour settings or profiles. I will not give much else on this topic as like I said, its a subjective topic that everyone will have their own preferences for.- Pixel Inversion. I had to look up what this was when I read reviews about the monitor, and even now that I know what it is, I can safely say that this monitor does not have it. At least I can't ever see it.CONS:- The power button is a little fiddly, more fiddly than maybe most people would appreciate. Because it is more or less flush with the underside of the monitor it requires a bit of extra pressure to click. This usually means that you need to place a finger or two on top of the monitor to counteract the action of pushing up. This is one area where ASUS do have a win, their power and OSD buttons are much easier to operate.- The glossy black finish to the rear of the monitor is not the best choice ever, but its also one that is vastly common in monitors (my BENQ monitors are glossy black all over for example). I would have preferred matte black all around, but it is at least matte black on the front, which is the really important part after all.- You DO need a computer with some umph behind it. If you're running a older CPU or GPU (even a single GTX 970) I would not reccomend the jump to 1440p. A good CPU with a decent overclock, strong RAM and at least a GTX 1070 are what I would say is the minimum to get the juicy visuals at the higher resolution. However, don't feel that you need a GTX 1080 or more to get the goods at 1440p. I personally was worried about performance with my PC at 1440p, but so far its been excellent.Here are some approximate examples to give you an idea:- Witcher 3 (1440p, Ultra (Grass density distance on High), Hairworks ON) - 58-72+fps- GTA V (1440p, Mix of Ultra-Very High, 4x MSAA) - 55-70+fps- Deus Ex Mankind Divided (1440p, Ultra, No MSAA its a broken setting anyway) - 45-70fps (this game has not got the greatest track record for optimization right now).- Overwatch (1440p, Epic, Everything switched on) - 70-100fps- Hitman 2016 (1440p, Highest settings minus turning down Shadow maps one notch) - 45-100fps (this game again has wild up and down results depending on where you are, even at 1080p....but G-Sync has your back, you wont notice it much at all).- Rocket League (1440p, Everything switched on) - 144fps- Deus Ex Human Revolution (1440p, DX11, Everything switched on) - 230-300+fps (just for fun :P)Overall, this is a great monitor. A superior piece of kit to the ASUS ROG Swift competitor in my opinion, and I think that is an opinion shared by a lot of people who went for this monitor over ASUS. I can tell you from personal experience that I felt a lot more confident in my purchase of this monitor than I did buying the ASUS, and my confidence was rewarded.Purchasing a monitor (especially at this price range) is a big decision, but I hope that this review will get people a bit more in the know of the big positives and some of the smaller ones that make this monitor a great choice!",

                "reviewText": "Me dej\u00e9 llevar por las opiniones de los dem\u00e1s compradores y me decid\u00ed a comprar este monitor. Llevo dos dias con \u00e9l y estoy encantado. Me alegro mucho con la compraLo que m\u00e1s me est\u00e1 gustando es el G-Sync. De verdad, hay que verlo en vivo para apreciar lo bueno que es.En cuanto a que es un panel TN, os cuento que yo ten\u00eda un monitor Samsung con panel VA de 1080p a 60hz y en cuanto a colores, una vez calibrado apenas noto la diferencia. La resoluci\u00f3n teniendo una tele 4K la verdad es que no impresiona tanto. Lo que s\u00ed se nota y much\u00edsimo son los 144hz. Me est\u00e1n gustando tanto que estoy pensando vender mi 1070 para pillarme una 1080ti y aprovechar as\u00edel refresco de pantalla y poder jugar todo a m\u00e1s de 100fps.En cuanto a la est\u00e9tica, es un monitor sobrio, sin colores llamativos o leds RGB, pero a m\u00ed eso me gusta. Tambi\u00e9n me ha llamado la atenci\u00f3n los bordes que son muy finos, tanto que con el monitor apagado te tienes que acercar para saber donde termina la pantalla.La calidad de los materiales es buena, no es premium, ya que casi todo es pl\u00e1stico pero se nota resistente.La peana es c\u00f3moda de manejar, va suave para subir y bajar.Lo \u00fanico negativo que podr\u00eda ponerle es el precio, algo elevado para ser un panel TN. Yo lo he comprado rebajado a 615\u20ac As\u00ed que tampoco es una locura de precio. M\u00e1s de 700\u20ac si que me parecer\u00eda una mala compra porque por 750\u20ac tienes paneles IPS.En conclusi\u00f3n, recomiendo mucho este monitor. Tal vez los de panel IPS se vean mejor, seg\u00fan dicen porque yo no he probado ninguno. Pero con respecto al VA est\u00e1n muy a la par.",
