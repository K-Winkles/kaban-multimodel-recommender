The issue of whether there was a stylus included or not did not matter to me so this was a non-issue.The chromebook came and I checked out the case and keyboard immediately. The case looked like it was brand new and had no scuffs, dings or imperfections of any kind. Also the keyboard was in excellent condition as well as the trackpad.The performance of the chromebook is first rate and works well for me. I am not a gamer so cannot speak to that but it works fine for streaming videos, watching Youtube, reading ebooks and composing and reading emails. Excellent job all around.Finally the video display is excellent and there are no dropped pixels and colors are very vivid. Only negative I would say it that the audio could be louder but I do have a bluetooth speaker and earbuds so not much of an issue for me.Overall, considering the price, I am extremely pleased with the chromebook and would definitely recommend it to others and would definitely buy again.",

May not be original accessories but will be compatible either way, which was fine with me. I specifically bought this Chromebook for my son's digital art so the stylus was kind of important and I'm pretty annoyed there wasn't one. Chromebook also could've been cleaned a little better but whatever. Otherwise was well packaged in a new cardboard box and seems to be working well. Will update once my son actually uses it.",
