                "reviewText": "The system is flimsy and made with low quality components. I suppose it is good for the price and I could live with that if it worked. I have not been able to get the audio to stay active consistently and I have only had this for two months. MSI support has been absolute rubbish and wants me to factory reset it and/or send it to them at my cost, even though it is under warranty. Also, they told me I bought the laptop at Costco. But I bought it here. That means the seller is buying and modding Costco laptops and selling them as new.I've tried an assortment of things including EC reset, BIOS update, driver updates, driver uninstall and reinstall and more. There is sound when Windows starts and all the audio devices go away when I log in. I can't find anything on Google about it and the vendor refuses to do anything more.So, all this to say, don't buy an MSI or at least not from this seller if you want help with it.I may revise this if the seller takes some action to resolve these issues.",
