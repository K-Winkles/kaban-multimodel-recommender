Plays games like GTA and Cyberpunk2077 on med-high just fine.Ultra settings in newer games may stutter, but that differs by user.Battery life unplugged is a joke. 1-2 hours. But that's normal for gaming laptops.Same as in picture.Packaging was good.Positive experience.Recommended.",

So open minded and equally willing, off I went.Trackpad illumination switch - Not working, Control panel not working or responsive at all, Windows update -trust me there are a few -- Updates done Yay !!! windows relaunching it says.....Zzzzzzzz after 3.5hrs it decided to take pity on me and started up finally.......My patience and disappointment at equal frustration boiling points,In summary for me a very bad experience for others I hope your machine works out. as for me back to MSI I go to be honest.",
