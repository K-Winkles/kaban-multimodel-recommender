The screen is 14 inches and is easy to read. The Chrome app is awesome, it works flawlessly and is easy to navigate. I was surprised that I was able to restore all of my bookmarks from a computer that died recently. That was a plus that I didn't expect, thought I would have to redo them from scratch. It is a lightweight laptop, easy to carry around. It doesn't have a cd-rom drive, but you really don't need it since it streams shows and videos. The battery lasts all day, it doesn't lose power in a matter of hours, like other computers batteries. I charged it, then unplugged it overnight, and it still had 18 hours of charge left this morning. This laptop is a choice that I am happy with, I recommend it to those who like Google Chrome OS.",
