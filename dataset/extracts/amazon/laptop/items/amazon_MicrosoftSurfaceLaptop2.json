I haven't had this happen yet, but I've seen photos of more well used laptops having spots of wear, dirt, and sweat on the material. They sell products to cover the material, but I think it was just a bad design choice and a general oversight.The performance is exactly what you would expect for a laptop from this year and with these specs. It preforms office tasks and basic browsing with flying colors. I don't see this laptop doing well for anyone who runs more demanding programs like the adobe suite or blender for example. But for what you pay for, this laptop does beautifully. The screen quality is excellent, touch screen is responsive, laptop holds charge for quite some time and charges pretty dang fast.I absolutely LOVE how thin this thing is. I've owned many laptops in the past and this thing blows my previous MacBook Air out of the water on it's portability and weight.Overall, 100% worth your money if you're looking for something affordable, functional, and sleek.",

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because there is a very small tad bit of wear on the edge on the keyboard. No one would ever notice unless you tried hard to look at it.Spec's were as advertised (8GB RAM, 256 SSD, i5). Screen quality is amazing, Glossy and clean. Keyboard is in brand new condition.I will say I am impressed with how they packaged the product, knowing it's a refurbished device. It came in an authentic Microsoft box.",

                "reviewText": "I, like so many other on here, had some reservations about going with a refurbished laptop. I decided to try this one out, as the dealer had a lot of surprisingly good reviews. I\u2019m sure glad I did! The computer came in original box, and the machine itself looks brand new; no dings, scratches, or chips and it was clean as a whistle. The start-up was quick and streamlined and so far the item functions perfectly. Only drawback was that I thought the surface laptop 2 had a removable screen and it appears I was incorrect. That was a research error on my part however. Digital drawing programs still appear to work great and the surface pen operates flawlessly with this laptop. I\u2019m really looking forward to using this laptop for school and art!",

Quick, keyboard fantastic as is touchscreen. only add on to buy, if you're a numbers geek like me, is a blue tooth 10key (about $14.00) and mini hub extension ($8.00). Then you'll have four USB ports and a fully functional expanded keyboard. Super good computer.",

I am not an expert on laptops, but needed something reliable that I could stream movies on, and have good video for long distance chats. Love the metal, and I got a plastic sticky cover because I was worried my hands would stain the fabric. So far, it's performed excellent.",
