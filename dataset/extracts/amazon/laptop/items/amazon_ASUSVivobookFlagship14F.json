                "reviewText": "I had a very nice Asus Chromebook that was reaching its end of automatic updates life. I love the operating system, but this EAU stuff ticked me off big time and I decided to go with a W11 laptop.This is a VERY nice machine. Screen is beautiful, touchscreen and flip features work as expected. This is not my main computer, so 16Gb, 500 Gb SSD, and a Ryzen 5 5600H are just fine. It has a type C USB, HDMI out, and two USB A third generation connectors, as well as a headphones/mic thing. I'm not a gamer, but the screen is gorgeous and the computer is responsive. Keyboard is nice as well.There are a couple of caveats. These are not negatives, but might be something to consider when deciding what to buy.If you choose to get a keyboard cover, be very careful what you purchase. For an ASUS laptop, the layout is nonstandard. This is a TN3402QA. Make sure you get the right device.Second caveat has to do with power. It really likes to be charged with a dedicated charger rather than USBC. This is despite the USB C port clearly marked as power delivery capable. It would accept input from a UGreen 100W charger, and it didn't blow up, but it kept telling me that the charger was low power. If you do purchase a second power brick, this computer needs a 4.5mm barrel, 3.0mm inner diameter connector. Again, not typical for ASUS and it was a bit of a wild goose chase to buy a backup charger.All that said, I am extremely happy with this purchase. Great price point, great performance for my purposes, great screen",

I got the 24gb ram and 1tb ssd and it runs perfectly so far.Pros:\u20142 in 1 laptop\u2014Touchscreen is great and can be turned off if not wanting to use it\u2014Fingerprint scanner on power button\u2014Webcam Shield for privacy\u2014Backlit keyboard (can be turned on and off)\u2014Number pad on touch pad when needed (SO LOVING THAT)\u2014Charges very quickly\u2014Easy set up. If you know your way around windows and pc, you will have absolutely no problem setting this up without instructions.\u2014Steam games run great\u2014I have good internet but even then, this computer runs very quickly and pops up things immediately.Cons:\u2014Battery life is not great, but I\u2019ve seen that in reviews and from other people. It\u2019s unfortunate but for me the pros of this laptop FAR outweigh this con.\u2014Charger is a 2 piece, which is annoying on Asus.\u2014Some stuff was pre installed and would cause pop-ups and had to uninstall a bunch of things I didn\u2019t want but not a huge deal.\u2014Fan is a little loud but not as loud as previous laptopsOverall I\u2019m still rating it a 5 stars but closer to 4.5 because the pros outweigh the cons for me and because the seller was great when I had questions. Plus the did the upgrade on ram and ssd.",
