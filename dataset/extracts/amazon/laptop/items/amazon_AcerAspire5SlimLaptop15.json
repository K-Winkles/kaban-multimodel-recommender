                "reviewText": "Great laptop at this price point. What makes this such a good value is Acer makes several versions of this. You can spend a lot more depending on your intended use but if that use is more basic you still get the good candy, so to speak. Same sleek design, very good screen, same materials and build quality, and all the latest tech inside along with Windows 10 Home once you switch out of S Mode.If your laptop is four or five years old like my old one you're in for a treat. Everything about this one is better than my old. It's lighter, quieter, sleeker, runs cooler, and the screen is leaps and bounds better. The keyboard feels quality, back lit, and you won't disturb anyone while typing as its very quiet in use. No more clacking!Cons? The screen could get 20% brighter. The volume could be louder from the speakers and varies in loudness from app to app at 100%. No optical drive if you're used to having one, but inexpensive external drives are easily found. No finger print reader or USB-C port as found on the more expensive models of this unit. But as said if you want or need more, pay more.Thanks to the AMD graphics you can do light to moderate gaming with this if you upgrade the RAM to at least 8gb. Quick, easy, and cheap to do. You'll need to adjust settings down, also. Sometimes dramatically. But you can play some games. Less demanding and older ones with no trouble, and on higher settings.I would recommend upgrading RAM to 8gb or more, and storage as well if need be. This isn't a matter of shortcomings with the unit, just a matter of you get what you pay for out of the box. Which is enough for a lot of us. Heck if you use your computer like many to browse the web, social media, stream videos, store photos, online shopping, modest multi tasking, and for school, work, and organization, you may not upgrade at all. I've been using it out of the box for those purposes for three days and have no slowdowns, hiccups, or crashes. It just operates smoothly, quietly, speedily, and looks good doing it. Oh, and boot up time is non existent. This thing is up and running as fast as my phones.I got mine on Cyber Monday and saved $30. But had I paid more I'd be just as happy. If in the market for a sleek and stylish BASIC laptop that doesn't look or feel like a budget unit and with all the modern hardware and software inside, you can do worse. But certainly no better.",

                "reviewText": "I rarely review products but figured this may be helpful to some. For starters, some background context: I am in my mid-20s and have long since finished uni. I am not a gamer. I primarily use my laptop(s)/tablets for streaming shows/movies; occasionally working from home; and crafting/design editing. I used to go through every iteration of a MacBook but, while nice, soon found myself not really utilizing all of its features & could no longer justify its price-point (especially since I do still have an iPhone).This laptop is a STEAL for ~$300. I did my research and honestly, like a majority of the other reviews here said, the Acer Aspire 5 blows every other product in its price bracket out of the water. That said, I went into this fully knowing I wanted an inexpensive laptop and that, because of that constraint, whatever I ended up purchasing would most likely have some limitations. If you purchased this and are disappointed about the specs in correlation to it being ~$300.... I really don't know what to tell you other than that you definitely were looking in the wrong place.I solely bought this computer because I recently got a CRICUT Explore Air 2 and needed something compatible with it (Chromebooks won't work and my MacBook is so old it can barely handle the newest OS); however, I already know now that this is going to become my main laptop and I will get a lot of use from it outside of just crafting.THE IMPORTANT STUFF:1.) This is a solidly-built laptop. Very sturdy, very lightweight. Perfect for on-the-go. It IS aluminum though the whole way around, so I recommend buying a case or sleeve to avoid scratching.2.) The screen resolution and sound quality is surprising very good, crisp, and clean - while I think perhaps it could be a tad bit brighter, that's just me being nit-picky. I would still recommend using external speakers if you want to retain the quality of sound at its loudest setting, especially if what you listen to is bass-heavy.3.) Turning off Windows S-Mode was absolutely painless - it's literally just going to the website that's taped on the outside of the box and clicking one or two buttons.4.) Like other reviewers recommended, I did purchase another 8GB of RAM and installed it myself (I googled YouTube videos on how to do this for this specific laptop model; there are plenty of them, just take it slow and you'll be fine). I opted to leave IN the 4GB stick that was already there, thus giving myself a total of 12GB RAM. The difference in speed is HUGE and, like I said, I'm not using this for *too* much other than everyday use. Spend that little bit of extra money if you can, I promise it's worth it! I can't speak to anything as to whether it would hold-up with gaming, but definitely for a solid several hours of streaming content, crafting, and/or having multiple tabs & apps open simultaneously.5.) The track-pad is VERY sensitive. Not so much so that I would take off a star, but enough to notice. I recommend purchasing a wireless mouse if you plan on doing more intricate work to eliminate any annoyance or mistakes. I bought one (a Logitech one, $10) and so far it's definitely made designing and editing much easier.It's been awhile since I've had a PC but it's nice to know that a lot of its shortcomings (such as memory space & speed) can easily be fixed and modified to your preference. Again, at the end of the day, this is NOT a heavyweight laptop, both literally and figuratively speaking, but that's okay because it's not meant to be! Overall, I would highly recommend this computer to anyone who is looking for an everyday laptop that is both budget-friendly without sacrificing too much of its quality.",

                "reviewText": "I bought two of these laptops in the summer of 2020 for $299 and $310. The first thing I did was pull the stock memory and storage. I added 16 GB ram and put in 1 tb drives. I installed Xubuntu Linux, later installed Debian Linux \u201cbookworm\u201d Release. with no driver issues. I added a USB 1 GB Ethernet adapter/hub combo to the 1 USB 3.1 port. This Laptop has a good screen and I like its lighted keyboard. Its Ryzen 3 3200U processor isn't fast, but its fast enough for my needs. I only use this laptop as a VPN internet share laptop for my work at home 2nd local area network. I could use an VPN router for this, but would get much slower internet speeds. Using the laptop as an VPN share device I always get good internet speeds. The second laptop I have as a backup, if the Linux OS gets a bad update and fails. It has happened 3 or 4 times where I had to use the backup laptop. Minimal downtime that way. Always good to have a backup.The only thing I don't like about the laptop is that every so often I will get a blinking battery warning light. When that happens I unplug the ac power to the laptop and let the battery run down to 15%, then plug in the ac power to the laptop and good to go. No more warning light. I pull the bottom cover off once a year to clean the laptop and make sure the battery isn't showing signs of swelling. So far so good. If that happened I would probably just pull the battery and run the laptop without a battery. These laptops have been a good value for what I use them for. The laptop performs well running Linux, I would not be running windows on the laptop. I think its processor might be to slow for that. In its stock configuration 4 GB of ram would be a bad day for windows.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this entry level laptop for my son to be able to play some basic games. This is the amd version with vega graphic, stock 4 gb ram no upgrades.First off, this laptop is really well built, the design and the look gives it a big boost. Beautifully made, definitely not something you would expect for a 400 dollar laptop.Spec wise, this model suits any general user perfectly, performance, noise, storage are all pretty basic but good for office computing. Documents, youtube, all with breeze.Video gaming, my son play minecraft and roblox on it, both allowed in windows 10 S mode. Depending on the roblox server and games, it does lag from graphic here and there, for minecraft, no problem.Battery is built in non-removable, so you will have to play plugged in with battery. I can't say for long term effect of battery life, you could open it up to take it out, but not sure if that will void warranty, and for the same reason, I did not upgrade the ram (shared between cpu and gpu, possibly enhance game performance).Couple tips and tricks for video gaming, lower your graphic settings, by means of in game, or your desktop native resolution. I know it's default at 1080p, drop it down to 720p will reduce gpu stress and lower heat as well at the same time enhance performance. If it is being used for kids, they can't tell the difference.All in all, I give it a 90/100 for the price that it comes in at.",
