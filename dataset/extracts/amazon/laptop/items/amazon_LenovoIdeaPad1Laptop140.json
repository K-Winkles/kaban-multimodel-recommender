Just need a wireless printer and we are good to go! Goodbye desk top.",

I can't have apps like, Google, Spotify, and Discord open at the same time without having to go into the task manager to force end it. Sometimes I can't even log in. I have had this issue since the end of 2021 when I bought it. I am sick of having to go for a lap around my neighborhood and still be loading. This computer has been giving me so much trouble that I can't even use it. I stopped using it because it was to slow to handle. I have done everything I can to make it faster but nothing works. I tried to reset the computer but still was slow and laggy. This computer is disappointing. I got this computer with windows 11 and had to downgrade to windows 10 because it was so slow. I have finally lost all my patience with this computer that I'm done using it. I am writing this review because I want to warn everyone before they buy this computer. Very disappointed with this computer. I have tried all the fixes for it but nothing seems to work. I also had a problem in the middle of January 2022 when it would not turn on. I am sick of this computer and it isn't like I gave the computer problems, they occurred right after coming out of the box and a couple days of use. I do not recommend this computer.",
