Impossible to connect to my Google account - just kept stalling. Got phone number from enclosed card to call for technical help. REady? No longer a working number. Sure, they will take it back but I got a useless piece of equipment from a company that is out of business and I'm the one who has to pack it up and travel to a UPS store. Stay away. Awful customer service.",

The only downside is it\u2019s not touch screen and my daughter is a kindergartner, still learning to use a laptop, so the fact that it has no touch screen is a challenge. I had to do some updating too but overall, it\u2019s wort the pay. We\u2019ll see how well it holds up.",

                "reviewText": "Firstly, the chromebook I received has less ports than the images on the Amazon page. On the Amazon page each side of the chromebook has 1 x USB port and 1 x USB-C port, for a total of 4 ports. On the chrome book I received only one side has ports, for a total of 2 ports.Secondly, the keyboard was filthy. It didn't go through a basic cleaning process, so my first experience with the device was scrapping gunk off the keys. This wasn't even regular grey/brown finger keyboard gunk either, it was orangey-red. The only time I've seen gunk like this was when I drank too much wine in university and puked everywhere and it was somewhat dry the next morning. Pehaps that's even what happened to this chromebook.On a possibly related note to the filthy keyboard, the '8' key does not reliably work. It needs to be pressed very hard for the pressing of the key to register. It is possible other keys have this issue, I've only noticed the one so far.There is also a crack in the frame above the tracking pad. If everything else was okay, I wouldn't let this get to me, but a crack in the frame is more than the 'superficial' imperfections that were advertised.I would be returning this unit immediately, but I need a laptop in a couple days for work. It does seem like it would be a decent unit if it were new or atleast didn't have keyboard issues.What I received was clearly not what was advertised.",
