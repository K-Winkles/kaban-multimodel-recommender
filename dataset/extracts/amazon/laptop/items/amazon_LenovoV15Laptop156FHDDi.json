I'm not going to bother calibrating but the viewing angles are not great either so there's a good chance you'll have difficulty with content creation. It's best at full brightness, which also annihilates battery life.I'm not a gamer either to know whether the machine is fast enough for those tasks.What I can say is for a budget laptop with that's quick with lots of ram and storage, this is a good business machine. Unfortunately one way they kept the price down is having no keyboard backlight and minimal ports. You can get all that from the description and photos.I have a higher end laptop for production. It has an OLED 4k screen and it's even faster but I also paid more than 2x the price for it. I bought this one for one specific software related to diagnostics and repair on heavy duty trucks and it's more than enough for that.I actually find it more pleasant to use generally since it's a bit lighter. The chiclet keyboard is also pretty good.",

Back to the computer.. never heats up, charges up quickly, has a decent battery life. Keyboard is an 8/10.. It feels great and comfortable on the fingers, tactile feel.. Trackpad is pretty good as well.. Took me a while to adapt due to coming from Apple beforehand and was searching for that command key for the longest haha, but the learning curve was fairly simple for me. Good sound as well. The display is not the best, but it's good for most people. Feel as though it could be more vibrant. Easy to start up and shut down, both are quick. I like the Lenovo, that camera blind is a cool feature. Nice size and comfortable for the around eight hours per work day that I use it. Go buy it! (no proof-read)",
