It was absurd. I received a phone call from HP this morning, they said that this computer was originally a four gig computer. The computer had been opened up by the seller, and 12 gigs of memory had been added to it. By doing this, it voids the HP one year warranty. It also corrupts the computer. There is a reason why it\u2019s so cheap, I really needed a cost-effective computer. This is a very very bad situation. I reported it to Amazon, and they don\u2019t really seem to care.",

I think people are getting tired of the Monopoly Microsoft has had and the secrets they keep. If their OS is so great then let others peer review it? That\u2019s never going to happen though because they don\u2019t want anyone to know what they can do when they want to or decide to.I gave it 2 stars only because win 11 may perform well on the thing.",

Talked to Amazon and they sent a replacement. The replacement came in but still no portable hard drive. So I sent it back.Laptop works good and is fast. But ordered this one because I craft alot and need a extra hard drive to store all my images on. So very disappointing.They really need to fix this.",
