                "reviewText": "A good place to start would be that I got this chromebook at a discount ($749, down from $999). And my needs are mainly to run Citrix (through browser or Chrome app, either works) for work and to casually browse, read magazines/books or listen to Spotify. Not a \"Power User\" by any means, though not sure any Chrome OS user is.That being said, this is THE BEST CHROMEBOOK I'VE EVER USED, and it is more than perfect to suit my needs.Build: The thing is beautiful, a really premium feel to the materials, and the red is really classy and not too gaudy as I was a bit worried and almost went with the more drab grey option - I'm glad I didn't. The chrome ring around the outside is also a premium touch that looks great. It's the thinnest and lightest 2-in-1 laptop I've ever seen, and I know that I like to use 2-in-1s in tablet mode and this is the first time it actually feels comfortable and feasible to do that for more than a brief period of time. The 2.2lbs was a big draw for me when comparing this laptop to the Galaxy Chromebook 2, Asus C436, or the Acer Spin 713 - upon using it I am glad I took it into consideration. Other great things about the build are the relatively loud stereo speakers and the built-in stylus. Minor drawbacks would be the weak hinge that doesn't always hold the screen in place when moving the laptop if open (though for the most part it does the job) and the lack of ports (you just get 2 USB-C ports, which also function as charging ports, so if you're charging you only have 1...adapters easily solve this). Also the cameras are weak but I don't use those - if you're buying for camera quality only for some reason (Zoom?) then this isn't the one for you.Screen: The SCREEN is AMAZING. The OLED is top notch and better than any Chromebook I've ever seen, at full brightness the colors are insane. That being said, the high resolution and the brightness eat at the battery life a lot, so in most cases I've got brightness scaled way down and I don't really miss anything, it works fine. Touch works perfectly, the stylus allows for really detailed notes/drawings in Canva or other apps. One drawback might be the bezel placement, there are 3 super-thin outer bezels and one larger bottom bezel... in tablet mode that one larger bezel functions well as a \"handle\" of sorts, but the other sides can't be touched without accidentally hitting the screen and scrolling or clicking a link, etc. A very minor nuisance at most. Another minor issue is that the resolution is SO GOOD that when I run Citrix, the session almost appears blurry, but still workable - on high resolution windows machines Citrix has addressed this with DPI scaling, but they've yet to master this on the Chrome OS app or the Chrome web app. Not Samsung's issue, but still part of my experience with the machine so I thought it worth mentioning.Performance: This thing is a BEAST. There's arguably no need for an Intel i5 in a Chromebook, but here we are, and the thing is FAST. Scrolling is smooth and even with tons of tabs open I've never experienced lag when playing videos or games. With lots going on under the hood, and no fan, I've heard mention from others that the computer can get really hot under heavy loads - I've barely experienced this while using a decent amount of processing power, and would elaborate that when I did feel heat it was very minor and not unbearable by any means. I'm thinking unless you are gaming a lot or developing in linux or doing something really really processor heavy, you'll be fine. A small performance gripe in general is that Android apps don't always play well with Chrome OS and have re-sizing issues or some lag, but this is not a Samsung problem, more of a Google problem.Battery Life: Some people have called this the achilles heel of the laptop, but I don't have much issue. Again, I'm not a real gamer/developer/super user - I am Joe Basic using it for administrative work and browsing/music/reading. On an average day at like 70% brightness I can unplug at 8am and make it to about 3 or 4pm before having to plug back in while working in Citrix doing basic tasks on MS Access, Excel, etc - nothing intense but that's pretty much constant screentime for about 6-7 hours before it starts getting low and I've got to plug in. Obviously this is not great in comparison to 10+ hours at full brightness seen on other Chromebooks - but you are getting more than the average Chromebook here and this is a bit of a concession made on Samsung's part to provide the rest of the goods. Overall if you don't need to be away from a charger for more than 6 hours every day, you shouldn't have an issue.Should you buy it: If you have read this far and think your needs/usage are similar to mine and you want the sleek-est, coolest, thinnest chromebook out there, DEFINITELY BUY THIS (especially if on discount, which it frequently is between Amazon, Best Buy, and Samdsung's own site).",

                "reviewText": "Early impressions - Impossibly thin. Android apps are surprisingly better than web app variants. Red is the laptop color I never knew I needed. The keyboard travel and \"thud\" is satisfying and the trackpad is Apple level.Like every other review, the battery is abysmal compared to any ultrabook in 2020 (3-4 hours max with comfortable brightness). However, this is the best home laptop you can get right now. The design is hard to appreciate until it's in your hands, but I have never seen a thinner device with an i5 chip. It gets warm without a fan but nothing uncomfortable. The pen performs better than the gen 1 Apple Pencil I'm coming off of. I can't say this is great for art, but you get access to Concepts in the Play store and Adobe Draw. I do wish Samsung Notes was an option given the Galaxy name, but here we are. Big, big fan of using my mobile only fantasy football app (Sleeper) on a bigger screen. Most Android apps I've installed are responsive which helps to avoid going fullscreen/forced to use the touchscreen in portrait.Connecting a Dualshock4 controller was effortless, didn't need to configure for Among Us either. Some games like Shadowfall will need some effort to work. No CoD Mobile support was a bummer, hopefully in an update.Complaints: The screen looks great, however no 4k support on most streaming options AND due to the OLED this screen is very dim by default. If you have it at 50% your eyes will be strained after an hour. 70% is comfortable, getting 4 hours average.If you're looking to continue your Android experience in laptop form, this is the way.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this Chromebook because it was decently priced (under $600), didn't have a Celeron, was thin and wanted to try my hand at something that wasn't Windows based.Took a bit of time figuring out how to navigate and am kind of still learning but this laptop is very appealing for what I was wanting to use it for. It's the only Chromebook I know with a 4k resolution screen, not that I was wanting it for that, but the image quality looks stunning. The i-5 processor is fast enough to handle most any daily functions and the thin stylings of the laptop itself is very appealing. It comes with a stylus that's installed directly into the machine and works flawlessly. Audio isn't anything to brag about but does get plenty loud for most entertainment options. I normally use it to watch a sports game while playing board games with friends or watching Youtube videos to learn said board games. Convertible mode is exactly what you'd expect but was surprised the laptop doesn't get extremely hot when the screen is folded to block the air vents. Is small and light enough that it doesn't seem so burdensome but large enough that it doesn't feel like I'm typing on something meant for a child.My biggest issue though is the 4k screen. I can watch all forms of resolution on this laptop but have no options to force the resolution to something lower to help save on battery life and boy is the 4k screen a energy hog. My entire view point before buying this was that I knew the battery life wasn't that great but figured I'd just lower the resolution and get whatever I could out of the battery but was disappointed to find out that's impossible. Don't get me wrong the 4k screen is beyond beautiful but now I need to plan accordingly if I'll be out and about with this Chromebook, something I didn't really expect when purchasing the product.All in all I'm happy with this product and as long as the battery life isn't a complete deal breaker then I highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Jahre lang das Samsung Galaxy Book benutzt. Aber das Windows Betriebssystem wird immer schw\u00e4cher und bietet nicht wirklich viele Neuerungen. Deshalb habe ich mich f\u00fcr ein Chromebook entschieden. Und zwar das Samsung Galaxy Chromebook in Rot.Verarbeitung: Das Chromebook sieht super aus. Ist leicht, d\u00fcnn und hochwertig verarbeitet. Mit integriertem S-Pen.Die rote Farbe leuchtet sch\u00f6n. Sieht Edel aus.Ausstattung. Das Ger\u00e4t kommt mit Ladekabel (USA), man braucht einen Adapter f\u00fcr deutsche Steckdosen. Ersatzspitzen f\u00fcr den S-Pen. Kurze Anleitung.Display: 4K8 GB RAMSpeicherplatz: 256 GB. Kann durch eine Micro SD Karte noch erweitert werden.Sehr n\u00fctzlich ist der Fingerprint Reader. Damit l\u00e4sst sich das Ger\u00e4t sehr schnell entsperren.Betriebssystem: Chrome OS. Ich selbst nutze Chrome OS Beta. L\u00e4uft rund ohne gro\u00dfe Probleme.Batterie: Das ist das Problem bei diesem Ger\u00e4t. Die Akkuleistung ist nicht gerade berauschend! Man kommt auf 4 bis maximal 8 Std. Je nachdem wie voft man es benutzt und was man alles eingenstellt hat. Ich kann mit der Batterieleistung leben. Nutze es nur Privat und nicht f\u00fcr den Job.Man kann es ganz aufklappen und dann den Tablet Modus nutzen. Ideal um mit dem Stift zu arbeiten. F\u00fcrs zeichnen ist der S-Pen nicht geeignet!Da es nur in Amerika erh\u00e4ltlich ist, kommt es ohne deutsche Tastatur aus. \u1e9e,\u00d6,\u00c4,\u00dc gibt es nicht.Fazit: Es w\u00e4re das Perfekte Chromebook wen die Akkuleistung besser w\u00e4re.Kann es aber trotzdem empfehlen. F\u00fcr den Gelegenheits Chromebook User.Wer es f\u00fcr den Job braucht, sollte zu einem anderen Ger\u00e4t greifen.",
