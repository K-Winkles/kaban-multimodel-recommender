                "reviewText": "The product arrived on time as expected, but unfortunately the product had been damaged during shipping. I do not believe the damage was in any way negligence on the seller (Olive Computers) as much as the courier (FedEx). I was able to successfully start up the laptop and go through the Windows 10 setup without any issues. I think just shy of the shipping damage the product would've been exactly as advertised with very minimal noticeable scuffs or scratches to the plastics. The screen had zero dead pixels, and the keyboard keys were all functional. Wifi worked as expected and no dead USB ports on the board.I did make three attempts to contact the seller (Olive Computers) via the provided phone number on the setup sheet that was provided with no success, so I have to deduct one star for communication. I really would've preferred an alternate solution or perhaps another back cover replacement, but I suppose in this situation a full return is necessary. No harm no foul in my opinion.Conclusion: You will absolutely get what you paid for in the condition that's advertised. Fast 2-year-old laptop. Honestly just bad luck of the draw for me and my set of circumstances.",
