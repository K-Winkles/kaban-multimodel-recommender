                "reviewText": "I've been testing this computer for only a few days so here are my first impressions:The computer looks like new, have very very minor scratches in some corners but nothing more. It has extremely solid build with an amazing keyboard one of the best I've had, no lights though. Its a heavy 14'' laptop and its not for you if you are looking for a super slim fancy laptop. The other thing you might want to consider is that it lacks the HDMI port.Its a very fast notebook, I bought it because of the SSD and it makes a huge difference. It takes less than a minute to get online and working from a shutted down state. It can handle many opened programs with the 8 Gb of RAM and the intel HD 4000 integrated graphics allows to play low requirement games (no hardcore gaming).The audio is pretty good, sounds loud ofcourse not in the best of qualities but you can watch any movie without the need of any external audio device. The screen is not that good because is very sensitive to the angle of the viewer, but once you get it to the right angle it looks good. The battery life is not that good it only lasts 3 hours.I recommend this laptop for those searching for a budget friendly, fast and tough laptop that will get the job done.Overall I am very happy with this laptop, they made a great job refubrishing it and I would buy it again.",

Although the hardware seems to function well, the included Windows 7 operating system was so far out of date that the product key had expired. As a result, updates were unavailable. Resolving that problem, and obtaining printer drivers that worked, required several hours of professional attention. Moreover, the refurbisher does not answer phone calls and does not return calls seeking assistance. You're on your own, so if you're not an IT specialist you'll need expensive assistance.",

                "reviewText": "Although it shipped with a bad pixel on the screen (not a horrible thing, but I'm OCD), the company is shipping me a new one within the next week. Once I receive that one, I will return this one, no harm no foul.The streaming video was extremely choppy and unwatchable, so I simply found the latest BIOS (which is easy using HP's updater assistant, freely downloaded at hp's support website), installed it and once I did that, the video streamed perfectly. Took maybe 2 minutes.There was a corel wordperfect suite (or something similar) which I got rid of pretty quickly and replaced with OpenOffice, but hardly a spec of bloatware anywhere on the machine.One thing about this laptop, the screen resolution is 1366x768. There's another version of this exact same laptop with 1600x900 resolution. I would strongly recommend that one over this one. Had I known it was physically limited (and not just a driver update issue) I would have bought the higher res version instead.Awesome laptop for the price, super fast (11-12 second from dead to windows screen) and upgrade-able to 16 MB RAM (which I just ordered for this laptop).I'm giving this 5 stars because the screen resolution wasn't the company's fault, and they responded within a couple hours to replace this unit with one without a dead pixel issue.",

                "reviewText": "It started off fine but I'm now regretting going with a refurbished laptop. I've only had it 4 months and am already having problems. From the beginning, the bottom plate kept falling off. I'm guessing there should be a screw or something else that is missing. And now the \"right click\" function isn't working at all. LOL - never realized how much I used it until it stopped working. I've only installed 3 programs (chrome, open office and silhouette) and it slowed WAY down. Another thing that drives me NUTS (but has nothing to do with it being refurbished) is that the touch pad is large and super sensitive. So I'll accidentally brush it and my cursor will jump someplace else on the page in the middle of me typing. I'm SO glad I'm not in school and typing up long papers. I would seriously lose my mind. Even getting through an email can be really frustrating. So... it's a laptop, it works (mostly) and I can watch Netflix without additional speakers. But not the amazing deal I thought it was going to be. (I bought from Electro. Express)",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this laptop in September 2015. It has taken me through graduate school and law school. I have spilled every liquid imaginable on it, and it simply will not die. Some days I wish it would die so I could have an excuse to buy a new laptop, but I really have no need. I run windows 10 on it, the SSD is great, and the speed is excellent. I wouldn't use if for gaming or large data processing, but it is a wonderful computer for students and people who work from home who need a reliable machine that can run most programs in windows.This was also the computer that I used when I worked for the Big Four, so if it's good enough for them, it's good enough for me!One thing you should be aware of - you will need to replace the battery. I replace the battery approximately every 2 years on this machine; no issues.",
