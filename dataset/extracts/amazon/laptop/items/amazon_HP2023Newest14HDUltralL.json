                "reviewText": "This was a Christmas present from my husband. It was exactly what I asked for, but I could not have been more disappointed. Straight out of the box there were so many bugs. The computer was so slow and majority of the functions didn't even work. Which normally, okay Amazon has amazing return policies; no harm no foul, but in this case he bought from a third party seller and paid $45 for expedited shipping. I just dropped the package off to be returned and had to pay $35 of my own money to return the completely faulty laptop. Literally the only good thing I can say about this purchase from this company is that the laptop was a really pretty color. Other than that though - completely unusable. Took a whole 5 minutes just to launch a web browser and that's straight out of the box. I definitely think this company is selling refurbished items as new. Will never buy a third party on Amazon again.",
