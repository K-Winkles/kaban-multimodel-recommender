The internet is super fast and almost instant in changing web pages/pictures. The problems I have is that you have to register with Microsoft to get into the computer before using. Why? One other thing is that be aware of the VPN you using might limit access to internet. One final complaint is that we can't cover the WebCam. Why manufacturers do not include a manual cover is beyond me. Overall, it is a great system.",

                "reviewText": "Cyber Monday buy. Needed an updated computer with more storage, number pad and memory - and I got that. However, I didn't account for the bells and whistles that make me happy to see it and open it up. What is that you might say? Esthetics - Natural Silver is kinda blah and it's blah all over. The hand rest, the touch pad, the front, the back - all over. The buttons are not backlit and without ample light you are straining at the buttons. The letters on the keys are just a darker shade of blah. There is no indicator for number lock (there is one for CAPS). Typing on it, which I am right now, is very tinny, the buttons don't feel or sound solid and sturdy. The display is high white and washed out. Even moving the display forward and/or backward doesn't give a lot of contrast. The best I can do is dim the brightness. The battery life is pretty good but most everything is when new, that will have to be judged over the test of time.This is a hash of complaints but that's on me as I was constraining the purchase price to a certain point.Overall it meets the need but I could have done better given more patience and maybe a slightly higher price point. Oh and by the way - it's not touch screen.",

                "reviewText": "For years I have used Acer computers. But the last one I bought was a disappointment! 2 of the 3 ports failed. I was holding my breath that the last one would hold out until I bought a new one. Looking at the new computer reviews was dismal. SO I looked at HP. It arrived quickly, and was very streamlined in looks. The silver color is a pleasant change from my old black one. Price point was good and my husband switched over all the software to the new computer. I do wish it had 3 ports, but if these 2 last it will be great. It ran quicker than the old one. Hopefully it\u2019ll last several years for me. So far I am very happy with it!",
