                "reviewText": "I was looking for a machine that was about the same size and build quality as my 13\u201d MacBook Pro. This machine is perfect, for just that. Good build quality, very nice screen, portable form factor, good battery life and powerful enough to perform creative tasks as well as light gaming. All that for an affordable price. I bought open box, Amazon was the provider and everything was packaged well and works great! I play rocket league and this machine does well. The 90hrtz screen and 5mp web camera also make it a great all around machine for the price point. Sure ram is soldered but most ppl don\u2019t need more than 16gb. That along with the i7 and 1tb storage\u2026 perfection!I don\u2019t usually like hp, but this one has an upscale build quality unlike most of the machines available at the local tech stores. If you are looking for a light duty gaming machine that can stand in as normal ultra book. This is the one to get. Thanks for reading.",

Probably my bad by not reading further, now I have a computer barely able to do the rendering I needed.",

                "reviewText": "First off - the specs of this laptop are great. Latest gen i7 processor, a nice 16GB RAM, SSD, and a discrete GPU. All driving a high density OLED panel in an aluminum chassis.While it doesn't quite reach macbook quality and power, it certainly punches above its weight for the price. The screen is very pretty, but be forewarned, you can not use HDR when the laptop is on battery power. Not a deal breaker for me as I wound up turning it off anyway. Standard mode with this oled screen was plenty contrasty and watching any content or performing productive work is just great in SDR. Text is rendered nice and sharp, pixels are nowhere to be found.Beyond the screen, I found the touchpad to be very good. A nice size, very responsive, and fairly easy to click when needed. The keyboard is just 'ok' to me. I'd like it to be a bit more tactile, but it isn't bad. It is also backlit, which is needed, often even in lit conditions due to the way the keys are cut for the markings. They don't stand out at times to be legible without the backlight.Performance-wise, no problems. The PC is snappy and has enough memory and speed to handle any office tasks you throw at it with gusto. Annoying are the more than occasional pop-ups courtesy of HP's bloatware. Much can be disabled or removed thankfully. As mentioned it also has a discrete (albeit older) GPU from nVidia. I'd love it to be a bit more current, but I'm still happy it is here. I was able to run a few games from my steam library nicely. Nothing particularly heavy - this isn't going to handle intensive AAA titles at anything but the lowest settings, but for casual gaming, it runs great... which leads to..Battery life. This could be better. But couldn't it always? I found myself needing to charge it about every 4 hours with heavy browser based usage. I'm sure it can last a lot longer with simple surfing. That said it charges reasonably fast, and when in use, it makes hardly any noise.I also appreciate the inclusion of two USB-A slots, a micro SD slot, and that it charges via USB-C. Unfortunately, you can't drive an external display off of the USB-C (I tried), but you can do so via HDMI out which is also there, so there is that.If I had to complain, I'd say that I don't care for the material of the lid. It isn't metal, and it scratches down to an ugly black plastic quite easily despite me babying it. Of course, this thing isn't 2000 dollars either. For the price you're paying, it is quite capable of keeping up with more expensive units for sure.",

                "reviewText": "Purely by chance I decided to pick up the HP Pavilion Plus. I was in the market for a new gaming desktop PC as the one that I currently have is coming up on eight years old. It still performs, but can't be upgraded to Windows 11. I have always been a person that prefers desktop over laptop, with the thought that bigger is always better (or more comfortable to use). LOL Think again. The HP Pavilion Plus not only matches my desktop and GPU in performance, but exceeds the performance that I was getting on the desktop in like tests. It is also very sleek, lightweight and slim in design.The first thing that I noticed when I booted up to the introduction page were the eye popping graphics displayed on the OLED screen. Wow! Rich saturation with images that really come to life in stunning quality and detail. It is my opinion that OLED is far superior to other display options out there if you game or do anything with graphics.Setting up the fingerprint reader was easy and is a breeze to use. Of course I needed to test the security and so I had several people attempt to use their own fingers to satisfy my curiosity and concern.What I do mostly with my PC or now new laptop is edit photos, game and surf the web. A Chromebook will suffice for surfing the web, but for my other two hobbies I need a more powerful GPU and lots of memory. The HP Pavilion Plus has what I need in terms of power and graphics. In fact, with the SSD hard drive, the OS boots in 15 seconds. Everything about this laptop screams performance. Don't let the 14\" display scare you, it is edge to edge and to me looks larger. Maybe because it is OLED.If you like gaming such as World of Warships (graphically intense) then this is the laptop you have been waiting for at a price that gets you quite a bit of performance hardware for the money. Nothing is held back! I also use Photoshop extensively and not only do images look better than on my desktop monitor, but there is no lag in performance will processing.Some of the positives or likes I have for the laptop are its size, weight and comfort on the keyboard. The battery life will easily get me through a work day and it charges fairly quickly in under two hours to full charge. I can plug in my microSD cards or my USB 3.1 reader for transferring images quickly. With graphics, I am using the highest settings in games and I see super smooth flowing graphics.I have a docking station, and it connects effortlessly, but honestly, the HP display is much better than my high end widescreen monitor.I am overall very pleased with my choice as a gamer and graphics user in the HP Pavilion Plus.",
