                "reviewText": "Bought this for my son's 13th birthday. Hoped it'd last a while, made it 3 months. System crashed, cannot be recovered. Fought with Asus for a bit, but it's warranty with them was over 8 months before I even bought it, there was no way to know that. The warranty with the seller was over 3 days before it crashed. Fantastic. Pretty crappy that they can sell brand new in the box electronics and not cover a 1 year warranty on something that's never been used.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good little computer and it's an annoying little computer. It is good that it is light weight and easily slips into a knapsack with no noticeable weight increase. Watch the battery life, it drains rather quickly and is slow to charge. The unit also cannot be used at night, unless, and this is a big unless, you are a master of the keyboard. The reason I say this is because the keys do not light up. That is a big deal to me, because my last little laptop key's lit up and I could continue to work into the night.Perhaps this is a new feature, or I haven't figured out how to fix it, but the icons line up on the left side of the screen and do not save. Meaning, every time I want to go to Google, I have to manually type it in. I set Google as my default search screen and it always defaults to Bing, another thing I do not like.So, in the end, I believe this was a get what I pay for system. It's good in that it's light weight, the processing speed is awesome, but that could be my internet provider. I do not like how the websites that I go to on a daily basis do not save on a top rack that I can just click on. The keys do not light up and that is a big downer for me.2.5 stars for this unit, but I gave it three, because it really is a solid little computer, the set up is just not to my personal liking.",
