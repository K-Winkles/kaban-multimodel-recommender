No touchscreen but a good quality keyboard and touchpad make up for it. One little quirk: Google assistant only works when plugged in. That's weird and the only downside I've found.Great quality on my telehealth visits. Video and camera quality were good and smooth. Sound surprising since there are no visible speakers. Construction quality seems substantial. just what I expected from Samsung. Lightweight, sturdy, battery life of 10+ hours makes this unit fine for me so far. My first Chromebook and I was skeptical of them, but so far, for me, the usefulness. performance and speed for the price makes a great value. Can't find anything to complain about. 5 star happy after 6 months of daily use and I don't give 5 stars lightly.",

Last year I got a wfh job that ran on ChromeOS. So I started using it for work.Since then I've dropped it down a flight of stairs, kids spilled a drink on it, it's gotten tossed around a great deal, and it's dented on multiple sides (Don't recommend doing this, it just happened). Still works great. Battery life is as good as ever. Hasn't had any issues whatsoever.Screen quality is what you'd expect for the price point. Speakers get about as loud as a phone would. So that's the only drawback I could see for some people. :)Hope this helps!",

                "reviewText": "This is my first Chromebook. I did alot of inquiring and research prior to purchasing. When it arrived, therse was an issue with getting signed on. After trying myself for a couple of days, I decided to call support. I am pretty sure the gentleman I spoke with has never seen a Chromebook. He had to stop and look up every possible issue and even argued with me at times. One for instance, he told me to find the 2 buttons on the scroll and click the right one. THERE ARE NOT TWO buttons. It is one smooth pad like most laptops have. After an hour of speaking with him, I was getting quite irritated. He finally decided I had to mail it in for service. They sent me a shipping label with an incorrect name and mailing address. I then had to contact them again. The \"supervisor\" stated she would send a corrected label. This NEVER came. Eventually my son came for visit from 2000 miles away and had it fixed in less than 15 minutes. SAMSUNG: PLEASE get some people in your tech support that have a clue.Once signed on, this is a great little machine. I read so many negatives about the poor quality of the screen and I DO NOT see a problem. It is clear and bright. The biggest thing I am noticing is the speed - WAY faster than my old laptop!",

                "reviewText": "I'm split on this device. On one hand it doesn't have a great screen, it's memory and storage limited, the processor isn't very powerful, and it only has a single standard USB port. On the other hand it is compact, has decent battery life, an alright build quality for a cheap device, has an SD card slot, and does an passable job when it comes to writing, spreadsheets, surfing the web, watching videos, and even light gaming.Chrome OS, on the other hand, seems to struggle with most things. It lacks some of the basic functionality you expect of a modern OS and can be anti-intuitive to use. It has stability issues with apps, especially ones that compete with Google's own (such as Firefox).Thankfully you can install a basic Linux build for things like Libre Office, but many programs installed that way also seem to have stability issues (like VLC Media Player).The built in media player works but has a terrible interface and limited control, and only the terrible mobile versions of other media players seem to work right. The device has speakers, but they aren't very loud and seem crackly -- thankfully a headphone jack is included.It has no touchscreen and the trackpad is possibly the worst I've ever used, to the point of being frustrating and/or not working the way I want it to -- partly because of the OS, itself, and partly because it doesn't have any buttons or anything available to assist its functionality. A mouse is necessary for comfortable use.The keyboard is alright, comfortable to type on.Honestly, though, if I had the choice to go back and purchase something else I probably would. I'm not sure Google's operating system is for me -- you can't even use the desktop to place shortcuts or folders! I would just get a regular laptop and install Linux Mint on it. Doing so would result in an experience that is far more intuitive, stable, and with the benefit of having access to the functionality of a full fledged OS (and all the programs available for it).At the same time, this will do for most the things I bought it for, just less than expected in some respects.Buy if you want something super basic to write on, look stuff up on, and to keep records. Anything more than that and you should definitely go for something else.",

Yo la uso para archivos PDF, Word, Excel, correos, etc. Muy liviana, c\u00f3moda. Si quieren una laptop para el d\u00eda a d\u00eda esta es una excelente opci\u00f3n. Muchos se quejan de la pantalla, para mi est\u00e1 bien.",
