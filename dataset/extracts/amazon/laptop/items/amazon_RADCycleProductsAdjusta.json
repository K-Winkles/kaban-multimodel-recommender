                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Nice desk overall, makes pc gaming much more fun! [Review at ~4 days]",
                "reviewText": "I recently bought a trainer (wahoo Kickr Core) and had the idea of trying to play a few PC games while indoor cycling (spinning?), so I can be less lazy. I already had previous success with my Nintendo Switch (detached joycons make this easy), so I decided to give this a shot. This desk fits my small wireless keyboard and mouse pretty comfortably, is easy to use, and feels pretty sturdy. Plus room for all my other stuff (phones, water bottles, etc...)Assembly:Not bad, I have three left over nuts for some reason. Basically, assembly is just tightening a few nuts/bolts and this comes with the required tools. Was up in running in ~10-15 minutes.The worst part is the styrofoam used in the packaging, it's the cheap kind and there were large pieces that I had to break down to fit in the trash, and it created a mess of small particles all over my floor. Have a shop vac ready if you don't have a large trash can or otherwise plan on keeping the box around.Pros:- This really works, I can easily play PC games while cycling indoors. I tried out Halo: TMCC on PC (Reach co-op campaign w/ friend) and Minecraft, both were easily playable while my heart rate was ~150-160bpm. The desk is actually pretty comfortable (no sharp edges/bad materials to lay arms on). Easily some of the funnest gaming sessions I've had. - Cycling provides a lot of additional enjoyment to my games, this desk helps deliver that experience. - I wouldn't try this for any competitive gaming, just cooperative stuff on easier difficulties :S- Easy to raise/lower height. You can use this as a normal desk without a bike as well, it's just a little high at the lowest setting (raise your seat/use a bar stool). - You can also easily use this as a standing desk, I'm reasonably tall and this scales up to my standing level easily. I am currently typing this review while standing.- Cupholders! They fit my cycling bottles (that usually fit into the cages) perfectly- Stands for your devices: it easily fits my iPad Pro 12.9\", which is a pretty hefty tablet. There appears to be holes for some cable management as well.- I like the grippy materials on the surface of the desk, they make things sliding around less likely. If you plan to use a mouse, you will need a mousepad.- Seems like good value compared to the Wahoo desk, but tbh I never tried that one.Cons:- Bumping into the desk may knock a few things onto the ground if they aren't secured (computer mice). Just be careful if you're using this in a tight space like me.- The stryofoam. Ugh.- My USB-C cables wouldn't fit through the holes as the plastic surrounding the connector was too large, but my lightning cables do. Should be fixable with a dremel/drill if you are brave?Conclusion:Good value and versatile (usable while standing/sitting/spinning). None of the cons above are enough to detract a star IMO. I have only had the desk for ~4 days, and will update the review in case anything goes wrong (I plan on using it aggressively), but so far so good! I can see myself using this desk every day, and have so far.",

Sturdy! Works exactly as intended.Needs Improvement: the three-wheel (caster?) design is NOT super stable. Despite the wheel locks, if you use this, as I do so you can do work while you ride a smart bike (awesome), the entire desk will slide all over, which is annoying. There is nothing to be done about the wheel position (a tablet screen got smashed after it fell off this desk because the desk itself is so easy to tip. Since I hadn't put the protective cover back on the tablet, I won't blame the desk, but the tippiness is a factor to be aware of). A wheel (caster) at each corner would make this much more stable, so hopefully this manufacturer considers that and adds a 4th wheel to future iterations of this product.As for the wheels themselves, we got wheel chocks at the ye local hardware shoppe and voila! Desk sliding up as I ride is no longer an issue!",

Needless to say, I won't be returning this. Here is why I gave it 5 stars:1. It is easy to assemble and the tools needed were included included.2. It is a quality product. From the steel base to the arms to the tray, it is solid.3. Good value. I haven't tried the Wahoo version but this does everything I need for one third the price.4. Features....the desk pad is soft and grippy, height is easily adjustable, 2 cup holders, tablet/phone stands, wheels lock",

                "reviewText": "This table is perfect for indoor cycling training when using a smart trainer. It's height can be adjusted in seconds, so you can easily access the perfect height whether using different bikes or using a laptop, tablet, etc. Also, the wheels are a great feature since you can easily move the table while riding. Before I used the table I had thought that it was useless having the wheels, but during my first ride I immediately realized how useful they are. As you make adjustments in the saddle or change hand position on the handlebars, you can easily move the table back and forth to be at the right distance from your laptop or tablet. I think someone mentioned that this table is an imitation of the name brand, but it's still a very sturdy table and looks great. I bought this table from Amazon Warehouse and I suspect it was a return. This was an added bonus because I got a discount and the table came out of the box looking brand new. BTW, easy to assemble, took me about 10 -15 minutes moving at a snail's pace.",
