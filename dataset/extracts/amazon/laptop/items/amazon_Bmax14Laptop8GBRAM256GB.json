The older processor series is a bit slow for power users; but I bought it for simple stuff, which works great.Battery life is awesome!Computer has no fan which helps with power consumption....but could it overheat?

There is a provision to add another SSD, so storage really will never be an issue.Hopefully, it lasts and will serve me well.",

I can't say that you get what you pay for anymore, because my last 2 laptops cost a grip and they were both trash too. Quality is Dead, just building new junk every day. C.R.E.A.M.",
