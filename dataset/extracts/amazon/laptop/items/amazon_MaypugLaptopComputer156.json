The Maypug had the specs, and I decided to take a chance on it even though the price was far lower than similarly equipped models. I have been blown away by the speed, response, and capacity of this very lightweight but sturdy laptop! Set up was incredibly easy and all of my personal files were easily accessed in the cloud after I transferred my MS360 subscription. Graphics are sharp, video calls are crisp and the audio is every bit as good as my work HP. I added a Cakite 9 in 1 doc and I have a complete system that I would recommend to anyone.",

                "reviewText": "I spent quite a bit of time looking for a laptop for my 10 year old grandson for Christmas. He is very advanced at math and board with school and was complaining that some other kids at school with laptops were able to move ahead in math, and he wanted to do the same. Unfortunately, this is something his single mother could not afford, so I decided to do my best and fine something inexpensive buy a good value for the price. I have a lot of grandkids and definately could not afford this for all, but with his situation, I wanted to find him a laptop.I searched extensively for something that will be fast, have some minimal ability to play at least some simple games, good storage, good ram. I came across the Maypug 15.6 inch laptop, but kept looking and comparing, but I just kept circling back to this Maypug 15.6 inch laptop with Windows 11, 512 GB SSD, 16GB DDR4 and an Intel Quad-Cre processor. Nothing else I could find measured up as such a great computer at a great price. My grandson has had it for a couple weeks now and has been thoroughly enjoying having a laptop. It has been suitable for the things he is doing. It seems to respond fast and he has learned how to create some of his own games on it.I think this is a great computer, a real value for the money.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this laptop for my wife so she could do everyday tasks and browse the internet. It has good boot up speed, does great with her browsing, and functions well for what she needs it for. Price was good for the simple things she does and she has been very happy with it. Totally recommend for those needing a laptop to interact with the world, but not really needing to do anything complex. I've not tried to do anything with it past that since I have my own laptop so I can't attest to any added functionality.",

It has enough ports to connect directly without having to use bluetooth, which is known to be unstable for cricut makers. The keyboard is a little flimsy, but it's fine once I got use to it. Battery life is short but I always have it plugged in on my craft desk so that isn't an issue for me.",
