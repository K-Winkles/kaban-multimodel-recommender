I bought it for my wife who is an architect and does a lot of work in Autocad, so I putted 32GB of RAM in it, which combined with the i7-12700H (beast of processor), means that she can do her work without any type of problem, even though this laptop only comes with Iris Xe graphics.",

                "reviewText": "Specs list graphics as Intel Iris Xe, but it can't be enabled unless you have 2 sticks of memory installed(comes with 1x8gb). Until you do that, you're stuck with Intel UHD. Neither is amazing, but Iris Xe performs at least twice as well as UHD.Regardless of the graphics, you shouldn't buy this machine unless you plan to upgrade the memory immediately. This is because Windows 11 dedicates about 4.5gb of memory at all times for a new feature. You probably want at least 16gb of memory.The laptop itself runs pretty quiet most of the time(normal fan setting). With Iris Xe, it has some gaming capability, but nothing special, and the fan will likely be noisy while playing. It has vents on the back, side, and bottom which seems effective at keeping it cool through most normal operation. The processor is fast and apps load up quickly. Keyboard button locations take some getting used to. The machine looks clean and I love that the IPS screen is easy to view at most angles.Overall, I'm happy with this laptop, but only because I bought it with the expectation of upgrading the memory. You're going to need the upgrade so expect to spend a little more.",
