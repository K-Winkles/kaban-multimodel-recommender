There is no way to use this webcam in a professional setting for online meetings. The images are blurry and the highest resolution you can set on this camera is 480p. There is no place on this page that lists the resolution. This is a disappointment. 1080p has been around for many years, there is no reason that a webcam should be anything less than 720p, especially on a laptop listed as a Business Laptop! The only reason it's getting 3 stars is because of the other features. If I only rated the camera, it would be ZERO.",
