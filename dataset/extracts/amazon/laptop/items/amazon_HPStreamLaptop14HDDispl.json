Bing has too much advertising and I am just used to chrome... the only thing I hate that it doesn't have a keypad. which is my fault for not realizing this, but I bought a wireless keypad, and it does the trick. keeping my fingers crossed that it runs as long as my windows 7!!!! ASUS computer did. (.almost 8 years)",

                "reviewText": "I saw a total of 320GB memory and thought, that's plenty and the price is right. Figured it would be perfect for my wife, who would just use it for basic computing and online school. Most of the storage is on a 256 GB plastic thumb drive, worth about $20. Stil, I thought maybe we could live with it. After I set it up for her, I noticed that it was already using half the 57 GB of actual storage and aside from MS Office 365, I haven't installed anything or saved a single document. I'd say by the time I add all the peripherals, it will be out of storage! Ridiculous and not worth the few bucks I saved. It's being returned tomorrow. I gave it 3 stars because it is very lightweight and looks good and it's partly my fault for not being more careful in reading about it's features or lack of. One other thing, it is packed full of what are basically ads and solicitations to buy things that it doesn't need.",
