The 720P camera performs well in well-lit conditions, but may not perform as well in dark environments. I tried games like Resident Evil 4, Warzone, Apex Legends, and Valorant, and they all ran at maximum settings. If you have a tight budget and want a laptop for gaming in 2023 and 2024, this laptop is ideal. The only downside is the battery life, which lasts a maximum of 3 hours. Also, if you play for extended periods, it will heat up, so it's necessary to use a powerful cooling pad. Other than that, everything is in order. I also want to thank them for the gifts they sent: a mouse pad, an HDMI cable, and a USB extender.",

Problem, non-translucent black keys with printed red alphanumerics. The keyboard was lighted, (yes I knew about the function key that increased brightness), but the light shone around the keys and not through them. I couldn't see the markings to use the keyboard. Four stars because it worked fine and because Amazon's return policy gave me my money back without a restocking fee.",
