There is a lot of junk Macrosroft included in it's spyware festival and programming brainwash so I deleted most of it. It seems Windows 11 is designed to RUN THE USER and it takes control and makes the user do extra work. I am in love with W7 and this W11 has screwed with just about EVEYTHING good about W7 and turned the OS into a freeking nightmare. I hate W11 and W10 but the 'system' is set up to screw us for their profit.That said, it is fast and efficient and so it should be given it's guts and components.

HOWEVER, I have to say it came extremely well packaged, it arrived early and I was able to set it up with no problems. Keep in mind though that the first time of booting up a new OS, it does take a bit longer than normal but don't lose hope, this one did just fine.It looks like a new one with no visible marks or scars or scuffed places.I thought I ordered a \"touch screen\" so I find myself touching the screen now and then, only to remember this one is NOT a touch screen. Which is no big deal, just comical for me.I do recommend this seller. If this one takes a turn for the worse, I'll update my review. But I think it's going to be a keeper.update.I had to contact Customer Support over an issue (totally my fault) and they were quick to respond, gracious and VERY helpful.",

I was thinking it\u2019s so pretty, got to get used to it being slow. After all not brand new. But after spending a lot of time updating windows. It came to great speed. Lightweight. Doesn\u2019t have overheating problem. Great screen, contrast, brightness. Love it.",

                "reviewText": "I hate leaving bad reviews for anyone, but I guess this was a bit of bad luck for me. Usually I strike gold with Amazon renewed products, but this was was a dud. I opened the box, in which the laptop was shipped just in the normal laptop box and not inside of another protective box. I selected English and waited for Windows to start. I got to the part where it asks for an email, I entered it and the laptop froze. I kept clicking and nothing. It finally unfreezes, allowing me to re-enter the email and click Next. NOPE! It froze again! When it finally unfroze another time, I was able to sign in.After the laptop finishes and windows completes, I click on McAfee and it takes forever to load. So I give up on that and try to open Edge to download Chrome and it also freezes and then goes into the \u201cNot responding screen\u201d and stays frozen until it closes. I ran the McAfee to make sure it wasn\u2019t a virus on it or anything (I just opened the box right?). After it kept freezing I gave up and the boxed it and ran to the UPS Store to return this. It wouldn\u2019t even allow me to remove or access the email account because it kept freezing.Maybe I will wait until this Retrograde is over around Jan 13th 2023 to try another laptop.",
