I think it is an excellent Laptop, overall, to use at home. I cannot speak for its gaming abilities, but I think av gamer knows what they need.

Laptop dimensions exterior are 16 1/4 x 10 3/4, so fits nicely in Amazon Basics sleeve exterior17 1/4 x 13. And whole thing easily into 18 inch Komal Passion Leather messenger bag. Screen is stunning. Set up remarkably easy including Canon printer, Elements keyboard, Kensington trackball, etc.I only got this because there is a program that is essential for my business that will not run on 64 bit Catalina, so best choice was switch to PC for that application But I am impressed. PC has come a long way. And probably 1/3 the price of comparable Mac.Shipped promptly from this seller.Highly recommended.",

It's light weight which I thought would be a problem because I like things with a little heftiness to it, but this is just the right weight (5lbs) on average and the screen displays a clear wide field. The keyboard is designed as to not accumulate undesirable debris in and around the keys. To me this computer is beautiful. The camera display is a little gritty though, you may want a monitor display with a higher pixel number, but seeing internet information and document information is all great, clear, vivid colors and well defined. Even my Zoom meetings the picture comes out clear and well defined, it's just the fuzziness when you click on the camera.",
