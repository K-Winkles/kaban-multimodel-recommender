                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this for my wife to replace our older Dell E6400 which still works but is getting old. I received it yesterday and it looked great. It powered on fine and I went ahead and set it up a long with buying a Microsoft 365 subscription for Office. Well, after I walked away for awhile I came back and couldn't wake it up. Checked everything I could think of but ended up calling Dell tech support. I ended up doing a \"hard reset\" as instructed and it did come back on. But less than an hour later I came back and couldn't wake it up again. So I did a hard reset again and this time all I could get was a blinking led light by the power connection. So I did a hard reset again and it powered up ok. 15 minutes later it wouldn't wake up. I've contacted Dell again and hope to get help tonight with it. Meanwhile now all I can get is a blinking led light. From what I can tell on Dells website the particular pattern of blinking lights indicate a CPU failure or a Memory Ram failure. I lost a half a day yesterday messing with it and if I can figure out how to get my personal information off of it I likely will send it back. And to add insult to injury I just had bought Microsoft 365 for it. Meanwhile, I think I will just hang on to my old Dell.Update, Dell support was able to determine that the upgrade memory stick was defective and causing the issues. The upgrade memory was removed from the device and everything started working properly. I just had to remove the back of the PC carefully by using a small Philips screwdriver but I have a background in service and that was no problem. I let the seller know about the problem and they worked out an agreement with me to reimburse me for a new memory stick. They were helpful and kind. I wasn't happy I had this problem but sometimes things like this happen. I'm just glad they worked with me to make it right. I moved my rating from 1 star to 4.",
