                "reviewText": "At first blush, this laptop seemed like a fantastic bargain given the price. But not realizing until it arrived, the version of Windows installed is in 'S' mode, which means all software must come from the Microsoft store. However, the Microsoft store doesn't carry or certify several common applications - like Adobe Acrobat Reader for viewing PDF files or Firefox if you prefer a different browser than Microsoft Edge. Luckily, breaking the software out of 'S' mode is relatively straightforward, however it is important to note that once you do, you can't go back. So, if you believe Microsoft should be the only source of software for your laptop, keeping it in S mode should be fine - and you can pass all the security worries on to Microsoft. Similarly, for security and anti-virus, the laptop comes with McAfee already installed and changing it while in S mode is nearly impossible.Beyond the operating system, this laptop is great. The display is medium-sized but clear, and the keyboard big enough that it is easy to use, but note there is no separate number pad. Performance of the laptop is outstanding with plenty of RAM (8GB of DDR5) and hard-drive space (128GB solid state drive). I use this laptop purely to surf the web and play puzzle games, and for that, it is outstanding. I have not used it for graphic-intensive MMORPGs or for more intensive business purposes like graphic design - I have other computers for those activities.I have not been able to get the touch screen to work, but again I'm not using any software that really requires touch screen use. There are standard USB 3.0 ports on either side, as well as a single USB-c port and HDMI port for connecting to a larger monitor. The integrated wi-fi connection works well, though the sound is weak and tinny. There is an output for headphones (or speakers) that greatly improve the sound from the laptop. There is an integrated webcam and microphone for video conferencing.Overall, this laptop has all the quality features needed in a laptop. So, for surfing or general use, this laptop is a great purchase for the price.",

                "reviewText": "Right away here. This is a tiny bit underpowered going into the future. 8gb of ram on ANY device is not ok, nor is a 1080p display. However if you buy this to emulate cube/ps2/psp or play indie titles or older games at lower resolution, this isn't such a bad device. It could be a good first laptop for some one younger that also needs laptop use. It has a full OS in W11 but with S mode. Not much that matters for general use is missing.Screen is bright and colorful. More than usable even at a lower resolution. Keyboard and trackpad are more than usable as well. It runs fairly cool and quiet also. No signs of overheating or throttle while emulating. Wireless was decent too.Battery was a good few hours. I expect as low as 2-3 hours and as much as 12 depending on brightness and what you are running that day. Charges in under 1.5 hours to max.",

                "reviewText": "Technology is moving so fast, our old laptop couldn\u2019t keep up. This is a small but great laptop. Of course, understanding what you need helps. I just need something to connect to the internet so I can access my work portal. It is important for me that it\u2019s easy and quick to set up and this was a no brainer. Up and running in about 15 mins with the laptop doing all the work. If you\u2019re needed something for gaming and loading a lot of software on, maybe look further but for an everyday laptop that you can connect to a second monitor\u2026this is really a great affordable option. I\u2019d be happy to gift this to my teens as well for school work. Affordable to use for the basics.My star ratings are based as follows:5\u2b50\ufe0f - love it, can\u2019t live without it. Outstanding and amazing.4\u2b50\ufe0f - pretty great, no major flaws.3\u2b50\ufe0f - got some issues going on.2\u2b50\ufe0f - pretty flawed product.1\u2b50\ufe0f - don\u2019t waste your time or money. Just not worth it.",

                "reviewText": "This laptop is good for the price. It's good quality, I used it for 4-5 hours straight watching streams and doing some work the other day and the battery level went down to about 35% from full. It seems like it has a good battery life and it didn't get too hot either. The specs on it aren't great but I expected it to be much slower than it is. It doesn't have a lot of ram but I didn't really have any major issues with it.I think it's a great little laptop for the price and the screen quality is good. If you just need it for light work (documents, things like that) and aren't trying to do heavy editing work or something of that nature that you'd need higher specs for this is great!",
