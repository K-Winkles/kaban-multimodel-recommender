It is lightweight speedy and sturdy as well! It charged very fast and stayed charged for at least 10 hours so I could not be more pleased! As far as the amount of storage I did go smaller than I always have but I do have an external hard drive in the off chance that I decide to save anything which I typically don't intend to do other than a few pictures so I should be covered as far as storage goes! This laptop was the best value and had everything I wanted other than the touch screen you should purchase this laptop if you are in the market for something that is very reliable and sturdy and has a keypad for the numbers which was very important to me the keyboard is also backlit which is another important selling point to me this computer is so easy to use and easy to set up I'm glad I made this purchase it is hard to find a good laptop for under $600 and this most certainly is a good laptop!",

                "reviewText": "It was time to replace my six-year-old HP 15\" laptop. After quite a bit of research, I decided I wanted the HP 17\" model with as much SSD capacity RAM as possible. This one more than filled the bill with 1TB SSD and 32 GB RAM. I was a little apprehensive about buying it online after reading several negative reviews about the seller (RightBuy Electronics). My experience was flawless. The PC was promptly shipped to my winter home on the Florida Gulf Coast via UPS Express Overnight Shipping. It arrived just as described and in excellent condition. Understandably, a receipt signature was required. The UPS driver was already preparing to leave a non-deliverable note on our door when my wife failed to answer the door within 15 seconds. Fortunately, she caught him before he could flee.The setup was pretty easy. There has been a little bit of a learning curve since this was my first experience with Windows 11. But after just a few days it's working fine. It is much faster than my old laptop and the large non non-glare screen is great.",

Got my new laptop, was loving it, then about 3 weeks after I got it, my windows says I need to activate it. I go to settings and it won't activate. Upon further investigation, I find out the product key loaded on my new laptop is for Windows 11 Home. I contacted the seller, they asked me for my order number, I gave that to them. Then they asked what assistance I needed. I explained my issue and they have NEVER helped me! I have messaged them 3 times and they have ghosted me. They have not replied back at all. Amazon was no help either the 2 times I've contacted them. This seller is making false claims and they will not stand behind their product. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. BUYER BEWARE. HORRIBLE - THEY TELL YOU YOU ARE BUYING ONE THING THING then a week from the time frame when you can return your laptop, the Windows you thought you purchased with your new computer suddenly stops working and the seller WILL NOT EVEN CONTACT YOU BACK. THEY ARE LYING TO YOU JUST TO GET YOUR MONEY. DO NOT, REPEAT, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!!!",
