The only negative is there is no back lit keyboard. This is minor and I have a fix for that by ordering a USB light that plugs into the side of my laptop. Give it a try!",

I've tried it on different systems and it just hasn't worked. Other than that minor problem, it works great and it was a good price. Under most circumstances, I don't even notice it because I would play the sound out of external speakers.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this laptop (3511 Laptop, as an early Christmas gift for my adult son who is returning to college in January. I ordered it on October 15. My son used it in November to apply for admission in January. This week while on a zoom call with the college, the computer screen went blank, except for a white horizontal line. If you check, you will find few options to get through to Dell for either service or to give a review. Since I bought it from Amazon, I called their customer service number. My only option is to return it to Amazon and they will credit my account with over $135 less than I paid for it. It is their policy not to give full refunds after 30 days from purchase date. The customer service representative was thorough, professional and sympathetic, stressed that he had no choice but to refund my account for a fraction of our cost when we send back the useless Dell computer. I\u2019ve used Amazon for a long time as many people, particularly senior citizens, use for their shopping during the holidays, especially. Please be careful, especially when ordering an expensive item from Dell or through Amazon. Neither stands behind the products they sell.",
