                "reviewText": "I purchased this laptop with the 64GB hard drive for everyday web browsing, small Microsoft Office projects, and light streaming such as Netflix and Paramount as I haven\u2019t had a PC in more than a few years and have been using my iPhone for everything and it\u2019s nice to have a full keyboard to type and rest your wrists on.Straight out of the box this laptop was extremely slow which I expected taking the price into consideration \u2014 I was able to get everything set up in a reasonable amount of time and once I was finished with the initial set up I removed any unnecessary apps on it with one of the preinstalled apps I uninstalled being McFee Security which helped tremendously. (I feel with most budget computers you can run Windows Defender at minimum and get away with that without having the constant scans of third party security systems that slows the PC down in general.)The computer was shipped in the original box and arrived on time and in excellent/like new condition. It did need to be charged before I was able to begin the setup process. The keyboard feels nice. Display/Screen is nice. Multiple USB ports, external card slots.All in all, I am satisfied with my purchase and it meets my needs for the moment and if I decide it no longer does I am able to send it back for a refund.Great buy for the light laptop user!",

                "reviewText": "I admit that my loving husband purchased this Lenovo IdealPad 1 14 Laptop computer to show his support towards my long term navy career ambitions. Some of the professional requirements that relate to my navy reserve goals require a computer equipped with a working cac card reader that will enable me to access certain online navy related sites for professional courses and other military related online training requirements. The good news: I was able to at least test drive going to at least the front page of certain navy related sites easier than I thought it would be. Additionally, I was able to get into establishing a new hotmail account, signing into one of my gmail accounts and easily signing into the amazon account (that is connected to the review I am writing this on). The caveats: patience is necessary with this type of computer because I had noticed already logging on to some of the websites required some time. Additionally, both my husband and I realized that I am obviously going to have to both eventually browse around and inquire both online and offline for help towards permanently installing the software necessary to access a multiple number of the required online navy sites with the cac card reader I already bought (for training and other requirements mandatory for my navy reserve career). Aside from those caveats, I truly feel lucky that my sweet husband surprised me with this laptop gift and I obviously intend to utilize this computer for multiple months to come.",
