It blue-screened SIX TIMES in 20 MINUTES, and I couldn't get it to stay alive long enough to even put in my pin.I added two things to this laptop: Chrome and Finale. Both trusted programs that I have used without issue before; both compatible with the computer specs. To not be able to use either without a BSOD when I've only had the laptop for THREE DAYS is unacceptable.",
