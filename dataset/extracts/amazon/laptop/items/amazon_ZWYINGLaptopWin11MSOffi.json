For me I have it for little bit of programing and to do some home work in between classes. Carrying around this Alienware I have is just becoming to much all the time. It weights about 6-7lbs. Let me also start with the specs that it claims to have, are not updated. I got the 512 version was supposed to come with 8gb Ram and for the CPU was supposed to be J4105. This one came with 512, 12gb Ram, and for CPU J4125, it has the Intel UHD600 GPU. Which makes it a little faster then the previous the J4125 speed is 2.0-2.7ghz. the J4105 is 1.5-2.4ghz. Also the back side of the monitor is magnetic guess to hold things out of the way. Not sure why it is there, I do see how it can come in handy. I have a few photos of that I put in to show.I have played some games it. The video is Fallout New Vegas. It was left at the auto select graphics at medium. I haven't messed with the graphics much on here yet. It runs good and doesn't lag. I have ran Valhiem as well. Had to put everything on low, and it ran fine. It is fun little thing easy to close the top and go. I have a little messenger bag it fits fine with my raspberry pi, and flipper zero. It also came with a wireless Bluetooth mouse which was nice to have. Even playing fallout or doing work on it for a few hours it doesn't get all that hot. My Alienware will bake your legs. The battery life is decent for it's size. I can get 2-4 hours depending what I am doing. It does have Windows 11 PRO Active fully installed, also it has MICROSOFT Office full version installed. Some reason has MineCraft education edition it runs fine too. It is a nice laptop I do not have any complaints really a backlit keyboard would be nice, guess can't always get what you want. You can not go wrong with it.",

                "reviewText": "We've been looking for a portable laptop to bring with us to a cafe or while traveling, and the specs on this little machine ticked off a lot of boxes: 1) well performing 4105 Celeron chip; 2) sufficient RAM (12g vs the typical 6g or 8g on lesser mini laptops); 3) good storage (256g should be sufficient for most and was the model we got); 4) good connectivity (two USB 3.0, mini-HDMI, TF card slot); and 5) good battery life. This was perfect for our needs and came in a very light, responsive package. Most important for us was to have Windows 11 loaded and legitimate, and super convenient to also have Microsoft Office pre-installed so we didn't have to pay more for that productivity suite later on.This little thing was wonderful, and we only have two suggestions for future improvements: a) the mouse buttons were a bit too close to the space bar and frequently were mis-hit while typing leading to some deletions or unintended text; and b) perhaps switch out one of the USB 3.0's for a USB type C port, which is more common these days. Bonus points to make it chargeable via that port to standardize the charging block. For (a), the seller helpfully includes a wireless mouse so you no longer have to use the keyboard mouse. What a great bonus!We had a problem with the mouse on the keyboard, and contacted the seller. They were responsive and responded within a day to try to trouble shoot and solve the problem. Be reassured that if you purchase this unit via Amazon Prime you will have customer support to work through issues and come up with a solution.",

                "reviewText": "A surprisingly well-built computer sold by a responsive seller. Other reviewers have examined its hardware\u2014touchscreen, 12GB RAM, ssd sizes\u2014so my notes are more specific to the software side.My device arrived with a genuine copy of Windows 11 Pro, but already set up as Administrator with Office 2019 installed. Concerned, I reinstalled Windows via USB Creation Disk, but there are no machine-specific drivers available for download. So before a reinstall, you must back up the existing drivers through an elevated cmd command such as: dism /online /export-driver /destination:\"full path of folder on a usb/sd\"When you search the web, you can find other ways to save your original drivers, but do NOT reinstall Windows without first putting them on an external drive. After the reinstall, direct missing drivers in Device Manager/Unknown Devices to your saved directory of drivers and all hardware will successfully reinstall except for the mouse buttons, which will need reprogramming through Autohotkey or some other key remapping application (for a Autohotkey script to address this, google reviews of \u201cTopton L4\u201d and one will provide a download).Secondly, while the machine mostly performs well with very current Linux distros, internal sound/headphone requires a custom kernel compilation. If you google yangxiaohua2009 and visit his github, you\u2019ll find his work with the ESSX8336 audio chip and a couple of ready-made .deb kernels. His kernels do not include 32-bit capability in the .config, which I need, and only his latest kernel solves the issue of no sound after resuming from suspend.As another reviewer states, a usb headphone connection will produce sound in Linux and perhaps that\u2019s enough for a user that doesn\u2019t want the hassle of compiling. The hassle was worth it for me, and I run a 5.19 kernel on MX Linux 21 ahas (ahas has wifi working out of the box), and with his patches found on #9 in his github issues, I have internal sound and sound after resume. I imagine that ESSX8336 drivers will be available in mainstream kernels, maybe 6.2 or 6.3Also: a properly-working left mouse requires Linux terminal commands \u201cxkbset exp \"=mousekeys\"\u201d followed by \u201cxkbset m\u201dOne thing I have not been able to solve is the always-on fan. It seems un-programmable in either Windows or Linux\u2014on the other hand, this device can produce significant spikes in temperature, even during light browsing, so constant cooling may be necessary.Ultimately, these software workarounds prevent me from giving this computer 5 stars, but if you\u2019re willing to tinker, both freshly-installed Windows 11 Pro and Linux can perform admirably, and I\u2019m glad I bought it.",
