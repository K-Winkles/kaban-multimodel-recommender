It still charged up, but then less than 2 days later it crashed and won\u2019t even turn on when plugged in. I returned it, but was charged a $55 restocking fee because it had passed 30 days \u2014 since my daughter didn\u2019t open it until Christmas (I bought it in November). Can\u2019t trust this seller I guess.",

Plus, I think this was used before and recycled since some applications show someone else's ID and emails come up! And lastly, instead of throwing in a 256GB hard drive as a normal part of the deal, you had to sign up for it?!?! And when I go to contact the seller, since Amazon shipped it, they can't do ANYTHING to help. Never again - this machine, this seller, and Amazon for a PC!!!",
