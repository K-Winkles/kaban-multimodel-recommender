I rarely use it but I noticed when I first began using it weeks after I purchased it, it went dead fast and barely wanted to come back on. I used it today for the first time in along time and it went dead on me even tho it had been on the charger. Now it\u2019s acting like it\u2019s not going to come back on after being on the charger for 4hrs or more. It\u2019s still saying battery dead. I\u2019ve already thrown the box away so I can\u2019t ship back but I hate I did. Never again will I order from this vendor.",
