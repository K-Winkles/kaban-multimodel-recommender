I use my 2013 Asus laptop daily & am very comfortable with it, but it's time to update (a little).Chose this HP Elitebook 840 G5 because it's fifth generation (less bugs I hope!).I don't need or want all the bells & whistles (been there, done that). Shocked at the amount of info Microsoft collects (if you don't opt out). Really enjoy playing games offline, have collected Hoyle board & card games, Tetris Elements, Scrabble and many versions of Mahjong (2000 to 2017) love them all!! Tried the Microsoft solitaire on this computer - very addictive & animated, I like it! Very different than my Hoyle solitaire CD-ROM I purchased in 2001 & still play, 20 years & works perfectly.Refurbished & seems to operate perfectly. I really like the backlit keyboard but not a touchpad fan (my wireless mouse is quick & easy & also 10 years old).TekRefurbs did a terrific rehab job - I grew up with durable goods (I value a long product life, not just a couple years - then trash).I learned COBOL in 1974 (DoD version) and wow how computers have changed since then! I still enjoy them.Happy holidays!",

I purchased a replacement keyboard on Amazon for only $30 and can fix it myself. Everything worked out of the box with Llinux Mint 21.2 Cinnamon. Cost was $288 USD and is a good price for this refurbished laptop. Bought December 2023.",
