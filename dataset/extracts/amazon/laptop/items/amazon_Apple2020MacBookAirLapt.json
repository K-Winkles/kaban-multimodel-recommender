                "reviewText": "UPDATE 3/8/2023: i bought parallels desktop and a windows 11 license. I need it to try a certain amount of things in IT, however, the performance when running windows in a virtualized environment (like parallels is) it gets seriously affected on the M1, something that didn't happen with intel processors. You notice the performance degrading (but not that much, maybe 10, or even 15% i risk to say) when switching between full screens and main desktop with windows (full separate screen, remember that there's an option to seamlessly integrate within your macOS). You kinda feel the stutter but i can see the M1 processor get in the way and prioritize the screen, and that's a good thing to re-prioritize tasks that are being done in one screen or another (take the word \"screen\" as full-screen apps or software that switches between desktop and full-screen apps or between apps). In my case, running windows 11 makes the mbp m1 run hotter than i'm really use to, but it does not affect battery performance as much as i expected!... weird, isn't it?... love it!If you're going to virtualize something, that isn't Windows, you shouldn't worry that much on this laptop. Just remember that's still have 8gb ram and usable 228gb, therefore, performance wouldn't be the same as bare metal.Still, other regular software from apple or safari (or any other browser), Office365, Adobe XD, Photoshop do not affect performance nor consume that much battery, although if you are a graphic designer or a photographer making a quick change could make you brighten your screen, in which may lead to higher power consumption, which also could be confused by software running.One bad thing that i found with heavy usage is that the keyboard gets \"oily\", meaning, it wears in time and amount of usage per day; funny enough, the aluminum part of the palm rest don't have any signs of wear.Another thing that i found is that the left speaker sounds like it broke when hearing at 70% volume, i don't know if that's fixable or not, anywho anyhow... i'm gonna stick with that because i rarely use it.One thing that i've also found is how i got used to the fact that this mbp m1 takes nothing to return from suspended state, why? Because no matter what other laptop i use (or desktop, for that matter), all of them takes a few seconds to access to their respective desktops and another few seconds to actually be productive (after booting software)... This one literally takes nothing to wake and start using it... that's why i'm not changing this laptop... and yes, even with its flaws... why? because in critical cases when i need to go somewhere and fast react to do something at work, i just do it! it takes me 0 seconds to wake up the mbp and enter another desktop via anydesk or teamviewer or ssh... this takes time on most windows laptops... i love it!I just wish this laptop was upgradeable... after all at the end of the day, it makes my life so useful and convenient despite the down side of it... what a masterpiece! i just wish i could do more and more with it, i feel limited... but happy!and by the way, i still stand on my original review.ORIGINAL: I believe i've found my unicorn because this particular macbook air still lasts an insane amount of time! Although i don't use it on full brightness, i regulate it a lot. Connecting several devices to it via bluetooth is transparent, but unfortunately, Apple made the macOS more inconvenient to handle in terms of simplicity.User experience on the macOS is weird, you know as a mac user where things used to be, then you have to relearn some things and it doesn't feel like home, the new normal isn't good so far.Keyboard is relatively quiet, also, there's the missing keyboard light on this iteration of the macbook air, why did you take (probably) the most useful key from us?! if you're watching a movie you have to literally stop the movie, go through the menu from above and turn off the keyboard lights, or if you're on a presentation and everything is dark, you just turn your screen light down but you can't with your keyboard because you need to actually stop paying attention to the presentation and go through the menu, inconvenient as heck!I know (and i'm very well aware) that there are some workarounds to change to the keyboard light again using a small software... but that isn't the end-game, the thing is that we shouldn't need an extra software or aditional configuration just to use something the macbook had for, literally, over 10 years!Speed on this macbook: you don't even feel it... everything is instant, nothing is slow, if something is, it's most likely the software or the website you're on, is that simple! If you're planning on using massive storage, you should use an usb-c one, not an usb-a through usb-c dongle, you will have a bottleneck, that's guaranteed.I haven't used it on games because that's why i have my pc and xbox for. However, if you're planning on developing software on it, just make sure your libraries fit within 228gb (the half of it is recommended for all ssd's) of storage, if that's gonna be an issue, then go for usb-c massive storage.Weight isn't a problem, it makes you feel like you're having a premium laptop on your hands, but not enough to make your bag heavier. Construction feels like you own something premium and well-made.",

                "reviewText": "I was a bit wary of ordering such an expensive device on Amazon but it was on sale and my 10 year old 15in MacBook Pro was on its last leg and was far too heavy for me to take with me places for school and work, so I took the risk and got it. I'm glad I did. I LOVE it. It works perfectly, came double-boxed (triple if you count the standard Apple box) and the Apple box was still sealed. Easy to set up (although I've been an Apple user since the early 2000s so I'm familiar with the process). Even got to have the turn-on sound/Apple logo experience upon opening which is always satisfying. So much lighter, quieter, and faster than any other Apple computer I've ever owned. Doesn't overheat and the battery life is AMAZING. I'll use it all day (~14-16hrs) without charging it and it still has about 30-40% of battery left. Quick to charge as well. The best technological investment I've ever made.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this 2020 MacBook Air (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage) to replace a 2014 MacBook Air (4GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage). I am undeniably a fan of Apple products in general, because they work with little fuss and are built to last (note that my old MacBook Air is more than 7 years old and still working perfectly). Although I've been underwhelmed by some Mac models in recent years, this one is stellar IMHO. Unless you have very heavy system requirements this machine would be an excellent choice.The M1 processor is very impressive, delivering outstanding performance and power/thermal efficiency simultaneously. Battery life is every bit as good as advertised; I can charge overnight and use it all day without plugging in. Connecting USB devices such as external drives will shorten battery life, but that's to be expected. I love the fanless design, which means the machine is absolutely silent at all times, while the thermal efficiency of the M1 chip allows it to remain amazingly cool. In use, this computer feels very fast, especially with apps optimized for Apple processors (as MacOS Big Sur is). Interestingly, Microsoft has been on board early with M1 optimization; the latest Office 365 version is smooth and fast on this machine. I also tried out MS Edge on my new laptop based on a recommendation from another user and have been so pleased with its speed and efficiency that it's my current default browser. The touch ID and Apple Pay capability is a welcome addition.The only cons I see are minor in my opinion. Because RAM is integrated into the M1 processor, post-purchase memory expansion is not possible; if you think you'll need 16 GB of memory that model can be had from the Apple Store. There has been criticism of the fact that this machine has only two ports, which is fair. For me that's not insurmountable; I simply use a USB-C hub to provide additional connectivity. I've read recently that some users have had certain hubs cause problems with their M1 Macs, which appears to be related to battery charging through these hubs. To be on the safe side I use a built-in port for charging and have had no issues.Reading through the relative handful of critical reviews, it looks to me like most (excluding actual defects, which happen with all products) are based on lack of understanding. For example, I saw a large number of reviews complaining that this machine \"has NO USB PORTS!!!\", which is patently false. In fact, its two ports are both USB, they just require a different connector. What these users are looking for is the old USB-A connectors, which this MacBook does not have; however, that's easily fixed by using a USB-A to USB-C converter cable, or with a USB-C hub. USB-A peripherals are gradually disappearing as well, in favor of the new connector.All things considered, I really love this machine. The $899 price (at the time I bought mine) was $100 less than I would have paid at the Apple Store, and I believe I can probably get $200 on eBay for my old MacBook Air (try that with a 7-year-old PC!) leaving me with a total outlay of $699. Considering that I'll almost certainly get 5 or more years use out of this model, I'm very happy with my purchase and would do it again.",

                "reviewText": "I have been a windows user forever. I used to HATE on mac, and really apple in general. Owned android phones up until 2019 when I had spent some time using a friends iphone I started to fall in love with apple products. I got my first iphone (iphone xr) and I was hooked. I never thought I would own a macbook, I always used windows laptops/computers until this year. I had bought a few different windows laptops as I was returning to school to finally pursue a degree, and I ran into some issues. The first laptops wifi chip quit within the first couple of weeks and I tried everything to fix it, found out chips were commonly faulty on that unit so returned it. The second one was better, it had a good battery life, was small, but it got really hot. The last one was a gaming laptop because I thought maybe I would game on the go more (I ended up not) and it turned out to be way to bulky and heavy to conveniently carry around. That's when macbooks started to look real nice. Lightweight, battery lasted a while, small, and fanless (which is a game changer if you wanna actually use it on your lap). When the M1 went on sale, I knew it was time. I do not regret it. Getting used to mac os has had its moments, but the actual macbook is insane! It does everything I need and want it to do, and it doesn't feel like a hassle. It's also nice cause I can transfer anything and everything from my phone to the macbook with minimal effort. I have to admit, apple has done it well this time around, even though the m1 is a few years old now, its still an impressive machine and built so well (best speakers on a laptop I have ever experienced). It definitely beats out most windows laptops on build quality too. No gaming, I have not tried, and I don't intend to. I have a computer, its great, and I don't really have time to \"game on the go\" so I have no need for mobile gaming. Anyways, I highly recommend the macbook air, anywhere up from the m1 simply because they work well, and have high build quality.",

Se voc\u00ea tiver algum problema com monitor e ele tiver entrada DisplayPort, recomendo usar com o cabo Displayport para Thunderbolt.Acredito que um dos problemas com a qualidade da imagem no monitor externo seja contraste entre telas, j\u00e1 que a tela do macbook \u00e9 muito superior, ou pelo fato do sistema operacional da Apple ser voltado \u00e0 telas retina, com alt\u00edssima resolu\u00e7\u00e3o e muitos detalhes, diferente do Windows e outros.- S\u00f3 tive tramentos quando abri o Android studio com emulador iOS e mais diversas IDEs e servidores simultaneamente. (Peguei pesado)Se voc\u00ea for dev React Native ou Flutter esse computador \u00e9 perfeito, pois voc\u00ea pode usar o simulador iOS, que \u00e9 muito leve.Se voc\u00ea for trabalhar especialmente com Android, recomendo o de 16gb, porque voc\u00ea vai ter que racionar mem\u00f3ria",

A concorr\u00eancia vende produtos de pl\u00e1stico, com tela ruim e poder computacional mediano e cobra acima de 3 mil, 4 mil ou mais por isso. Considerei melhor investir um dinheiro a mais e comprar um equipamento de qualidade. N\u00e3o me arrependi: o Macbook Air M1 \u00e9 compacto, leve, bonito, a tela \u00e9 muito boa, o teclado \u00e9 muito bom, o trackpad \u00e9 sensacional e dispensa o uso de mouse, a bateria dura dias fora da tomada, o MacOS \u00e9 flu\u00eddo e f\u00e1cil de mexer. Une qualidade, poder computacional e tecnologia de ponta. Cobra a mais por isso, mas penso que vale o investimento. muito satisfeito com a compra.",
