The hard internet connection is through a \"standard\" USB port so you loose one of only 2 of those if you don't want to use wifi. (You may have to buy an internet cable adapter if you don't have a USP end on your cable - $10 from amazon, $20 from a brick and mortar.) You may need a USB extender adapter if you hard connect your printer or you use a remote keyboard/mouse with a USB receiver. There is one USB/c port. No optical drive or dedicated card reader ports. Poor contrast between key color and printed characters - white on grey. Power-on key now on right \"hidden\" among function keys - a bit of a p.i.t.a. until I stuck some red electrical tape on it Small SSD hard drive (128 GB) supplemented with 512 GB USB flash drive, so there goes one USB port. (Total of .64 TB.) So for speed, more RAM, light weight and slim profile you loose a fair amount of versatility and internal HD space. But I have an external optical drive, multi-card reader, twice the RAM now and a number of flash drives so I'm not going to miss my old laptop, which died on me anyway, too much - other than the software, some of which I've recovered already. As I get used to the new laptop, and keep loading new apps, I probably will come to love it as much as my old one. But right now I really don't. Would I buy it again? Very likely - I like the 15\" screen and very packable light weight, the longer lasting battery and the speed. which I will no doubt come to appreciate even more since I am traveling internationally again after nearly a decade of static retirement.",

                "reviewText": "I chose this item because the memory capacity was double that of a same priced HP item. I probably shoud have looked closer at the features.There is NO touchscreen. The touch pad sticks and you need to manipulate it to get it to click where you want. When you 'pinch' the screen open it's a fight... it will expand and then shrink if you attempt to expand it a little more. Very time consuming to operate.The \"ON\" button is on the top row of \"F\" keys, and not a separate button not near any other keys so you can 'feel for it\". You need to have a light on or be in daylight to find the key, unless you memorize how many keys from the right the on key sits.I've had this device for about a week and find I use more time than any extra memory may be worth. I would NOT recommend this item... check the features on one will less internal memory, but the modern features you expect. Not having touch screen is a huge step backwards.",
