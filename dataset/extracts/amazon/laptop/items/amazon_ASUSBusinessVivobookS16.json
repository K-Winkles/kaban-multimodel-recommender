                "reviewText": "I took a chance on buying this unit since it had 0 customer reviews but was not disappointed. This is a very serious business machine in the configuration I am reviewing it for. It is -not- for gaming, let's just get that out of the way right up front. The video card is not up to the task and that was a conscious choice on my part. I wanted a very fast laptop w/ touchscreen capabilities for work, this fit the bill.With an Intel Core i9 processor, a pretty fast SSD drive, and 48GB of RAM this fits the bill. The specs listed 32GB but there is apparently onboard memory so at 48GB you can't go wrong and the RAM is pretty fast too. Very fast boot time, about 20 seconds from power up to functional Windows environment.This is a very snappy and responsive unit. Touchscreen works flawlessly so far. I use this as part of a multi-monitor setup and it can easily drive 2 external monitors + the built in display can be used in touchscreen mode too.So that is all the good, and there is a lot of good for the price point. Now the not so great:Battery is \"meh\". Not awful, not great, under high load you will get 2-3 hours maybe but given that a Core i9 is a VERY power hungry processor and this is a high performance laptop this is actually not much worse than you'd get w/ other models. If you are 'gently' using the machine (web surfing, etc.) you can squeeze 4-5 hours out of it.It is heavy. Again, there is a lot of hardware in this model so I wasn't expecting otherwise but a MacBook Air this is not. Expect some weight with this one.Lastly, and this is my chief complaint. There are simply NOT enough ports on this unit. If you are driving 2 monitors you are eating your USB-C port with video output. HDMI port for the other monitor. This leaves you with just 2 ports remaining. If you have many peripherals (most business power users do) then you are going to 3rd party options like Powered USB 3 hubs. I had to do this, you will have to do this. So know that going into getting this.Overall for the price point, this is a high performer but gamers look elsewhere and know that you will almost definitely need a powered USB 3 hub to get it to do what you want.",
