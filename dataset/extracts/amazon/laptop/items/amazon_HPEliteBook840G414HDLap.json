I had previously purchased 2 of these laptops (not from this supplier) and the both got returned. They were faulty from day 1.This was my 3rd attempt to purchase this make/model refurbished device and I could not be happier. The machine as been working perfectly. There have been no issues. Battery life is excellent. It is lightweight and fast. I had previously purchased the HP Docking Station that goes with these models of laptops and all of my devices connect flawlwesly.Excellent product and a steal for the price.",

The backlit keyboard and camera work fine. I'm on a run of good success with refurbished laptops so far. My last one I got in 2016 and got about 5 to 6 years in before having issues. If I can at least get about the same with this one, I will be satisfied with the savings and tremendous value though I was smart and got the extended warranty to take care of any issues past the manufacturer warranty which I would recommend everyone to do. I'm looking forward to being very productive with my EliteBook.",
