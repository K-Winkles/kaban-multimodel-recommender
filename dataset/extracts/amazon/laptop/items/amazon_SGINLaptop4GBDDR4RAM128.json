I purchased it for my teenage son after his gaming laptop stopped working. It was just a filler until we got another. However he has been gaming on it ( for a couple of hours), he has used it for homework, 3D printing, and even created a couple of his own games on it. There is no fan ( that I know of), but it doesn\u2019t over heat. Has a nice amount of storage. The only con is that the sound isn\u2019t superb, but it gets loud enough for me to tell him to turn it down.I will be ordering one for me to use for business purposes!",

                "reviewText": "I used this computer a couple weeks before reviewing to test its functionality. Because of its price and the fact it's a brand 'X', I bought a four year warranty. Bye the bye, I got an email from the warranty company that they would help with any set up if I needed it. WOW! The computer is performing as good as my four year old $500 HP. That laptop has had a lot of issues including two major repairs. Understand that this new unit is built cheap. The biggest issue is that it runs hot. The 'legs' are not high enough so I have used a piece of weather stripping to raise the back of the unit so more air dissipates. I also would not recommend plugging and unplugging the power cord as the port feels flimsy. The same with the USB ports. There are two of these ports and I will use each on a 50/50 basis to prolong the their useful life. I also experience slowness when I use Photoshop. This app probably uses a lot computer power so it takes time to catch up with the key strokes on occasion. All and all it should last through the 4 year warranty period and what more do you want from a $300 17\" laptop.",
