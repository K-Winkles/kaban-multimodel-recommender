That is, what many of us are doing now and this laptop excels at this.Pros:Long batter life - this machine has a much longer battery life than my macbook air.Decent Screen - large touchscreen that lets you pinch-and-zoom, scroll, etcGood build quality - It is plastic, but after almost 8 months no incidentsPlenty of horsepower for most tasks - no hiccups on web-videos, email, web surfing, and light computing tasksPrice - this thing is a great deal.Cons:While the keyboard is decent, it does not have a backlit keyboardThat's about it for the cons! If you are looking to do video editing or cutting edge gaming, this is not the machine for you. However, if you are looking for a laptop with a decently sized screen and long battery life to do emails, word processing, and web-surfing, this is a great choice to do it economically.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this item brand new and it wouldn't connect to the internet except as a guest. I had to wait until the next morning for tech support to arrive to work. They walked me through steps to try to reset it back to factory specs (???) which it got stuck at about the third step. She told me they would send me labels for FedEx to pick it up, I told her I didn't have a printer, she said FedEx would have the QR label. After two more phone calls, I found out I have to jump through hoops, find a FedEx onsite place, after waiting a day for the QR label to hit my e-mail, take it to an onsite location where they can use my email to print out the label and send the computer in for repairs. Due to my health problems, none of this can happen. I have to send my phone with someone else, to the next town over to the nearest FedEx onsite location, with my \"NEW\" CHROMEBOOK, to ship it back, wait for them to receive, fix it, return it to me, and hope it works.I have had two Chromebooks in the past and loved them both. Unfortunately, I will never trust this machine now, and I will never buy another Chromebook. Lost a lifelong customer over this one. What happened to \"We'll send you a new one?\" If you send out a faulty item, you don't ask the customer to jump through hoops so you can make repairs and send the same crappy item back to the customer! You send them one that works in the first place!!Update: I received my Chromebook on 11/29 (my sister received hers the same day, same problem). I was able to get it shipped out on the 12/5 via FedEx using Acer's QR label in my Gmail. It was supposed to be delivered on 12/8 but got hung up and wasn't returned to them until 12/11. I received at email saying it was received and would take 7-10 BUSINESS days for a certified technician to look at the machine. This is the worst customer service I have ever seen. Buyer Beware!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this just to tide me over because my MacBook Pro\u2019s keyboard broke. I bought a Chromebook about 5 years ago and they have definitely improved. This Chromebook is very good. Scrolling can sometimes be choppy. The screen is very good. Images are crisp. I don\u2019t do formal testing but I did put it side by side against the HP Omen gaming laptop I bought a year before and they are quite comparable when watching HD videos from YouTube. It starts up quite fast which is expected. I used Microsoft 365 while I had this laptop and it\u2019s probably the only negative for me. I\u2019d rather have it installed.I am very happy with this product but I gave it to my father so he can have a new laptop. I bought another one that is more expensive (a proper laptop) and I\u2019m more satisfied with this Chromebook. No issues here except: I don\u2019t like that they say it\u2019s 2022 when it\u2019s manufactured in 2018 and the updates only last until 2027. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019d still have bought it because I don\u2019t plan to use it past 2027 anyway.I may buy the 17\u201d version of this Chromebook just to have it for watching videos and browsing. It\u2019s not that much more compared to this version although the 17\u201d one is not touchscreen.",
