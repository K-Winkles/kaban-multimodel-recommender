                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this thing! You can\u2019t beat this price for any laptop stand. Raises my laptop screen up to a great height and looks great doing so. The clear acrylic blends into my desktop instead of being another eyesore. It\u2019s a little squeaky when you move it around because of the acrylic on acrylic so you might not like it if your plan is to be typing on your laptop while using this, but I use a Bluetooth keyboard to type on and wanted this just to raise my screen up so the squeaking doesn\u2019t matter to me. I almost didn\u2019t buy this because I thought my laptop might slip off of it and it might be slipping around on my desk. It didn\u2019t really, but they also included little adhesiveness slip pads in the package. Once I put the pads on, this thing doesn\u2019t slide at all and my laptop doesn\u2019t slide at all on top of it. You have to lift either of them up as opposed to sliding them off. It\u2019s a really great buy if you\u2019re in to a neutral aesthetic. Highly recommend!",
