I also am about to go back to school and the Chromebook I had purchased previously is older and does not update any longer so some websites will not open at all. I liked this Chromebook, but forgot to look if it was touchscreen. This model is not. My previous Chromebook was touch screen and I didn't realize how much I use that feature until I didn't have it. One particular site I access regularly is sized oddly so not have a touchscreen made it near impossible to scroll down to the options I needed. I ended up returning this laptop for that reason, I have to have a touch screen, and luckily now I know that that is a deal breaker for me when I am looking for future devices.",
