                "reviewText": "I've been a gaming laptop guy going on 20 years. After my last two Asus machines had power problems, I did a deep dive into reviews of the current options. MSI is the current answer (like Asus, when they work) to, who makes a gaming laptop less expensive than Alienware and Razer, but higher quality than the cheaper brands that sacrifice quality. And for my use case, the GE76 Raider with a 1920x1080 screen is the sweet spot in the MSI lineup.Out of the box, my Raider works almost flawlessly. \"Almost\" - like many current gaming laptops, it has silly RGB lights, both keyboard and chassis, and the controls available for them are less than ideal. That's it, that's the only thing I haven't loved so far.I recommend MSI, I recommend their Raider GE76 line, and I recommend Techno Intelligence as a great laptop seller here.The Raider line has a lot of options. If you want a bleeding edge GPU, and are willing to pay for it, they have one. If you need to keep it around twelve hundred and are happy with 16gb ram and 1tb SSD, they have it. (Under that, they have the MSI Thin lineup.) If you want a machine pushing the envelope in all ways, rivaling Alienware and Razer, they have that, at the same high prices.I went for 32gb and 2tb, and an RTX 3060, with a 144hz 17.3\" FHD, and on Black Friday, that was fourteen hundred even plus tax. I'm happy, and when it's time to shop for another laptop, I'm going to start by looking at the current lineup from MSI.",

                "reviewText": "Mostly I use this laptop for work and playing MMORPGs. It handles the rendering that is needed as well as our internet can handle the traffic speed (rural, long-range wifi) and doesn't seem to heat up excessively. There is enough storage for my work and temporary placement of photos and videos until I get them to the backup drives.It is very quiet to operate, except if you have the fan on high. The keys on the keyboard have just enough resistance and 'pop' for me to be aware of key presses, and not enough to cause fatigue for long periods of typing. They don't click, but they're not silent, either.I wish it had a DVD drive, but none of the laptops do anymore, and I'm aware that I can get an external DVD drive to attach. There are enough attachment ports for decent use. One holds a wireless mouse, one holds the power for the cooler, and another is open for backups, drives, or card readers (although it has a built-in SD card reader).The screen has a nice color balance, and I haven't had issues with any of the pixels going out, like I did on my previous laptop. I can also rest my hand and wrist on the anterior of the keyboard without causing the computer to restart (also an issue with my previous laptop). It has a variable fan setting which I like a lot, because it's too noisy for workday use if it only had high speed.The color-changing LEDs on the keyboard are programmable, pretty much infinitely, which is fun. I also like the fact that I can change the intensity of illumination separate from the color.The main negatives for me have been keyboard arrangement. The power button is inside of the 10-key area, and I had to use the software to turn off its functionality, because I keep hitting it during gaming (I use my right for keyboard controls instead of my left). The 0 key is in an awkward position for using the 10-key effectively during accounting or data entry work, and where my thumb falls naturally is the right arrow key instead (so it's a little crowded).",

                "reviewText": "I've had laptops in the past when I got out the box, it was amazing for gaming. The last one which was 5 years old started to slow down, so I got this one. It was ok out of the box as it was better performance than what my old one was at the end of life of that one. It does get hot but yea most gaming laptops do. One night playing, It hard locked. I mean it wouldn't respond to anything, keyboard, mouse, not even the power button. Under normal circumstances with laptops you can just pop the battery out to get it to shut down. This laptop you have to take the bottom cover off. The battery is not easily accessible as most laptops I've had in the past. I had to get a screwdriver, unscrew all the screws just to pop the battery out. That's crazy. I paid quite a bit more for this one than I did the last one and I'm not thinking that it's all about you get what you pay for.",
