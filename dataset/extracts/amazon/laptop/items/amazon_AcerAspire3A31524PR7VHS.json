And the AMD Ryzen 3 7320U processor rocks with its performance, I was looking for a cheap Ryzen for the internal graphics processor they have. It's an awesome machine for lightweight old games, web browsing, and light stuff. It starts up in like 3 seconds after the screen turns on, the battery lasts some hours but I mainly used it connected to the power.The first boot-up was slow, I started it up without using the power cable, and it was really really slow, after connecting the power chord it became better and I was able to set up everything on Windows, it installed a bunch of updates and after that, the performance has been awesome, with the power chord and with only the battery. I assume at the first boot up it was overwhelmed by the number of updates and maybe it also needed some critical driver updates.",

If it lasts a year I will be extremely happy. Time will tell regarding longevity.Important tips: 11/5/23*You must update the system BIOS as soon as possible as there is a flaw which causes poor performance on battery power.*This item includes Windows 11 with \"S\" mode enabled. At the very least you need to remove this mode and without a microsoft account it is not straightforward to do so.*Install Windows 10 instead. Use the Windows ISO USB media creation tool. Save an image of the current SSD drive.. create a recovery thumb drive and then wipe the SSD. Doing a clean Win10 install from a USB stick does not require a new license key! The Win11 key automatically applies to the newly installed Windows 10 Home version. Go to the Acer website and download/install all the newest available drivers for your model.*Ditch (save) the power adapter and charge it instead with a USB-C - USB-C cable.Pros:Very acceptable screen quality for this price range.Measured USB and NVME speeds are goodDecently built and should hold up to light abuseWith proper drivers the CPU/GPU seem more than sufficient for light tasksGood battery life and seems to run cool with little fan noiseCons:There is no keyboard backlight despite the listing descriptionYou cannot upgrade this laptop. Internally there is no spot for a second drive and as far as I can tell no way to increase the RAM.The touchpad and buttons require more force than usual.No page up or page down buttonsNo ethernet or SD card portsHobbled Win11 OS requiring more than the average skill to get right",

                "reviewText": "My second ever Acer laptop. I had a small one in my younger years, and that thing struggle quite a long. This laptop is pretty much better in all it\u2019s way, but that because of today technology. Honestly speaking, this laptop isn\u2019t that great, but it\u2019s good enough for what I need it for, which is good enough for me. For $300, and even less on sales. You can do some light office/college/business work, light browsing, and very very light gaming on low setting. Unless it\u2019s an old MMO, you could probably get away with medium or higher, but don\u2019t expect much. This thing may have \u201c8\u201d gb ram, but in honesty. You\u2019re probably going to have around 3.5-4gb ram free, as window system will eat majority of it. My biggest complaint is that you can\u2019t upgrade the ram, it\u2019s sadly soldered on. Unlike the storage, which is upgradable, but do know you\u2019ll have to reinstall window. The casing feels \u201clight\u201d, very light, enough to where to I don\u2019t want to apply too much pressure as it might deform or bent it in a way, maybe cheap material. The display is\u2026.. uh do able? It\u2019s very dim and the color is like off, very off, don\u2019t expect to do any artsy stuff with correct colors. As for battery, it leaves a lot to be desire. Depending on what you\u2019re doing you could be around 2-7hr battery life, so make sure to always keep it plugged in. The keyboard is fine, it\u2019s nice to have a laptop with the side pad, it\u2019s something I use for when I do light gaming. Other than, it\u2019s a pretty all rounder budget laptop for a cheap price. Worth it for my use case, as I already have a gaming PC and a Steam Deck.",

                "reviewText": "Hardware choices, such as AMD CPU + onboard GPU, IPS screen, SSD, USB-C charging and battery life are all great for this price point.However, the RAM is soldered on, and therefore non-upgradable; for the technical, it is LPDDR5-5500, 8GB (2x4GB in dual-channel config). I am uncertain whether this will become a bottleneck, but so far, so good.The user manual suggests to initially cycle the battery 3 times from low battery to full to maximize the battery life long-term. The small pin on the charging connector seems likely to bend or break over time, but you can charge the laptop via the USB-C port as well, which should fix that problem if it ever becomes an issue, and is a cool feature to have.Physical construction seems pretty solid; it is made of plastic, but not flimsy, with a reasonably nice metal finish.Software wise, google how to take it out of S mode. Remove as much Windows 11 bloatware as you can. Or install Linux. Software drivers for Windows seem to work well so far. Haven't tested on Linux. Last BIOS update was 4 months ago which is a good sign in terms of support. This seems to be a fairly popular model, so I'm guessing that translates to better hardware support and bug-fixing in the long-term from Acer, but I could be wrong.Overall, quite pleased. Good hardware at a great price point. Solid construction. I think the designers at Acer made all the right trade-offs.Getting the software, I mean especially removing the cruft in Windows 11, is up to you.",
