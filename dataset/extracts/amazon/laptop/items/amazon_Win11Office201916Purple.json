I searched for a laptop to work from home and I was so indecisive for a while and finally I came across this purple beauty and just fell in love and read everything about it. It was what I needed for the storage and the speed for multitasking. I have no complaints really love the 16 inch screen the graphics are amazing, I love the backlit keyboard is my favorite and love that it changes colors and comes with a cute little pink mouse. I would definitely recommend it. You can\u2019t beat the price with the screen size and the features and of course the purple and the back screen being all colored, you won\u2019t regret it!",

I downloaded Fallout Shelter through steam for this laptop and it stuttered so much I'm pretty sure it was running tourettes.exe. For those who don't know Fallout Shelter is a MOBILE APP and almost ANYTHING else in the world can run it except this laptop. This laptop is NOT for gaming at all. It can not run ANY game at all and you should absolutely save your money. Not to mention that the RBG backlights for the keyboard are so light that you can't see them unless it's pitch black and your face is shoved directly into the keyboard. I have never returned a product so fact but this is easily the worst computer I have ever purchased. It has NO processing power, It can't even run games meant for cheap mobile phones, I wouldn't even recommend it for office use. The fact this laptop is 400$ is one of the biggest scams I have ever seen as it's not worth more than 35$ (note how I priced it less than the 40$ phone I used to to compare speeds to)",
