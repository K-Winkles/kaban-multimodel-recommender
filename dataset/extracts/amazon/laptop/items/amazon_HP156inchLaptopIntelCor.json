This computer has a \"delete\" button (surprise, some computers don't). Others have the backspace button, but I have found incredible utility out of the \"delete\" button.The computer runs fast too. Great for gaming and doesn't lag. Haven't tried online though (but also have no intent to do so).It's a wide screen, holds its charge well, and the key stroke is satisfying.The sound quality is descent. My old surface pro 4 had better sound, which surprised me. But the speaker for this guy is right in front of you below the screen and puts . Other computers I tried had the same speaker design above the keyboard with little holes to let the sound come through. They were definitely just for looks - their sound came from the underside of the computer, which sounds terrible. Not so with this HP.Macs and surface pros are great, but their costs are steep. This HP is an overall solid windows-based computer for the price when you want something to perform on a budget.",

Unable to return because i am no longer in the USA. I reached out to HO because it is under warranty and i am still waiting for a follow up response having gone through an online call with them showing the issue and sending the requisite logs. I am utterly disgusted and disappointed because it seems all my money is down the drain. I would not recommend.",
