Runs low end games relatively well, but do note it's not a gaming computer if that's what your looking for. The only thing I will say is I'm not a fan of the integrated battery, and if you do play your games on it or something else pretty power intensive it will drain the battery insanely fast, but it charges fast too. I'd recommend keeping it plugged in if you decide to run a game, but all other activities--searching the web, typing documents, etc--it's totally fine. I'd definitely recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I was getting a laptop for college and I needed something that I would be able to do CAD on (at least a moderate amount with decent performance) and all other laptops in this range did not offer nearly the specs this one did. The ryzen cpu, and 8gigs (technically 6 since 2 are dedicated to the iGPU) are all fast and having the gtx 1050 for dedicated graphics perfectly fits my needs. Also, it comes with a 512gb SSD, something no other laptop in the price range offered. The catch all to all of these is that the battery is pretty bad. The only way for the system to use the dedicated graphics card is if it is plugged in, at least if you want to use it for more than an hour. However, using it in low power mode off the charger for basic things like web browsing, studying, and watching Youtube the battery lasts several hours. The charger itself isn't too big either so it is not a pain to carry around. I recommend this if you are looking for performance per dollar and don't mind carrying around your charger.",

However, as another reviewer noted, it didn't come with the mouse like it was supposed to.The monitor is not a high DPI despite its high resolution, due to the fact that the monitor is quite large. I'm still deciding how important that is to me - if it is, I might return the laptop.This laptop also came with S mode enabled on W11 Home, which again was not described anywhere and is insurmountably annoying because you can't run any executables other than Microsoft Store apps. If you don't want to connect your MS account to Windows (which MS pushes so hard, but is not a great idea for a number of reasons), you have to reinstall Windows to disable S mode.The keyboard also looks and feels like something lifted off a cheap HP laptop from 6 years ago. Overall, it does the job, but it's not impressive.",

Great, SSD is awesome, but plan to add a harddrive for extra space. Dedicated drivers? AWESOME. Runs everything so smoothly. Price? Completely justified.
