                "reviewText": "I really got him this because it's cheap and does what he needs (web browsing). I set it up for him initally, and he's put it through the paces in the year and a half he's had it. It's got a ton of dirt and debris, from him eating on it and taking it outside to watch his nascar races as he smokes his cigarettes. It's taken the beating and abuse so far so that's cool. I can say he'll probably get 3-4 years out of it before he gets another one, and before it becomes obsolete, but it's great for now and does what he needs.We did have some issues getting it connect to a wireless printer, but updating it and powercycling it fixed that. Albeit, if you don't know how to troubleshoot, many people might give up. This isn't specific to this brand, but the the Chrome/Google OS in general. I sometimes think an iPad would've been better for him, and I think that's what'll want next. He was a laptop user his entire life, and as long as he can play his words with friends, smacktalk on facebook, and watch youtube videos and browse fourms. He's happy. It does it snappy enough for him to not complain. It's worth a buy for the price.",

I don't want to take my work laptop, as I can't risk it. I've now done a couple of trips with this Chromebook - and it fills the bill. Is the screen brilliant sharp? No. Is it lightning fast? No. Does it do the job I bought it for? Absolutely! And for not too many sheckels. I rate this a great buy and am glad I picked it up. Wifi works well. Battery life is great. Recharges quick. I've used it for web surfing, meetings, on-line documents, you-tube watching and movie watching when the hotel options sucked. If I have any complaint it would be I wish the speakers could put out a bit more volume.",
