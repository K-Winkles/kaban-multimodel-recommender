Because the drive is solid-state, it boots up in mere seconds. And it got here when they said it would, so no problem there, either. I haven't tried the tech support, so I can't comment on that.But...I'm not completely onboard with Windows 11, though: there were things I could do on Windows 10 that are not possible on 11 (having each active task show up as a separate button on the taskbar, for instance). But I can't blame that on HP, or on Computer Upgrade King. So, yeah, I give the computer 5 stars.>>> And now, a little update (a couple of months later) about an update: Apparently I wasn't the only one who wasn't thrilled with how Windows 11 was displaying buttons on the taskbar. Windows did an update, and the update solved the problem. So now I like the computer (still a whole lot!) and I'm fine with Windows 11 too. Count me a happy camper!",

                "reviewText": "When I purchased this, I realized, not only was I purchasing the HP laptop (my last HP worked for many years so it was my choice of brand) but I was also paying for someone to upgrade it, which left room for errors. I was very pleased with the specifications offered as it was exactly what I wanted, but was a little nervous to order based on some of the comments in the review. The checklist that was included with the laptop from the tech who worked on it and the manager who approved the work, helped to calm my concerns about the quality of the work on the upgraded components I requested. The setup went smoothly, and the laptop is working perfectly. It has only been a few days, and so far so good! It is amazing how other reviews can make you hesitate to purchase something, and I am someone who reads all of the reviews before I purchase. I'm very happy with my laptop so far. Pretty close to perfect!",

Even within 6 feet all my audio bluetooth devices have frequent drop outs and difficulties making connection. These devices work fine with my older HP Pavilion laptop. Often laptop will indicate that the bluetooth audio device is connected but audio still comes through the speakers. HP support made sure laptop had the latest drivers and still could not fix the issue. Don't buy this laptop if you plan on using the bluetooth feature.",
