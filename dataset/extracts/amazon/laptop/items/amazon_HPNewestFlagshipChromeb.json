                "reviewText": "Searching the internet, buying off amazon, looking at social media...this machine is perfect. Do not expect to get a laptop and do a bunch of power points or complicated Excel spreadsheets. I would say that an iPad leans a bit towards fun, and the chrome book leads a bit towards work (like email). Biggest benefit...USB ports! That is one of the biggest reasons I bought the chrome book. I can now download a lot of SD cards with pictures to the iCloud because I have access to a USB port (most of my video and photography equipment will download without removing the SD card). Would I buy it again? For $65, yes I would but keep my expectations limited. Overall, pretty happy as long as my expectations are in check.",
