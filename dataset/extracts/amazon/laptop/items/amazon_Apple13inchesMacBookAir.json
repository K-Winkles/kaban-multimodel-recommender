Even though this computer is a much older Mac - it's still in new condition. The price is excellent! However, I need to learn more about recent Macs to compare features well. I guess that more recent Macs have better technical parts (CPUs, RAM, etc.), but the software is the same. My next PC purchase will be a MacBook because MacBook does almost all the things my PC can - but it can do some great things my PC can't do well or at all (like iMessage and FaceTime, to name a couple).",

However, when it came to me in the mail, I had to clean it myself and I had to call Apple Support to help me get into the computer and delete the previous user off the Macbook. When it arrived, the previous user was still LOGGED IN and I couldn't do ANYTHING with the Macbook without his password. Luckily I have some computer literacy and Apple Support helped me wipe his user profile, update the computer and return it to factory settings. Oh, and I also had to CLEAN the physical computer because the keyboard had some gross stuff on it (not too bad though, not a biohazard or anything!).Basically, tl;dr, if you are prepared to do some work yourself and maybe make a phone call to Apple Support, heck yeah this is a great product for great value! If you don't know much about computers and you hate calling tech support... maybe pass on this deal, another one will come around.",
