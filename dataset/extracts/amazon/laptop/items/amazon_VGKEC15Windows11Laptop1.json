                "reviewText": "I purchased this laptop with a grain of salt, considering the price to features ratio. I needed a new laptop for my garage, and didn't wish to spend a fortune for a garage laptop. The setup was normal and time equal to other laptops I purchased. I was pleasantly surprised my the fit and finish. It's a good looking laptop for the money. It seems to be performing very well so far, and I haven't had any of the issues others have mentioned in their reviews. maybe I got lucky. I'm a little worried how it will hold up in a dusty garage environment. I try to keep it covered when it's not in use, but I guess we'll see. It replaced a HP laptop, which I've had for years, but has Win 7, and it's getting harder to keep it going. I'll update this review if issues arise, but for the moment I'm very pleased with my purchase.UPDATEI have been using this laptop for a few months. While my opinion hasn't changed, I would like to add that the CPU isn't that great. I tried playing some older games on it, and it struggled to keep up. It's a great laptop for browsing the web and light computing, but if your looking to play any steam games on it, you may want to invest in a laptop with a stronger CPU.",

                "reviewText": "This laptop was a great price for all the specs, but if the quality of the outer parts are important to you, I don't recommend. It is made fully of plastic, it feels very cheap/weak. It has a plastic smell once it heats up, also sounds like a small plane when the fan kicks on.However, aside from the cheap shell, the innards make it worth it, in my opinion. I really needed a laptop that could smoothly run adobe programs (indesign, Illustrator, etc.) and so far so good. It's pretty quick overall, but I've only had it a couple days. The screen is very crisp and vibrant. My only complaint is there are weird pressure points on the edges of the screen (shown in image 2) but they're only noticeable when the screen is dark. I HATE the charger that it takes, it's very odd and cheap looking. It probably wont last long and I'm not sure where I'll be able to get a replacement since I'm not familiar with the input. Also, the power button is weird, it's a key on the keyboard and I have to press it about 3x to get it to turn on.Also, it was packaged very nicely and securely. I was impressed by that part. I was at first worried about it, but the laptop was encased in a very sturdy bubble wrap sleeve, inside of a decent box.Overall, for a brand new laptop, that supports windows 11, somewhat quick, crispy screen, for less than $300, it's worth it. Maybe not a laptop that'll last for more than a couple years, since the shell, keyboard, track pad, feel very cheap/weak (I wouldn't trust my cats to sit on it, that's for sure) but I'd still give it about 3.5 stars",

It still does preform but my main concern if for how long will it.Wi-Fi: has issues with staying connected to your Wi-Fi.Terrible graphics . Barely even loads the search engine",

                "reviewText": "Ok let me start off b by saying overall I didn't expect much but it is well worth what you pay trust me I was shocked. The laptop itself is a great deal but it did take a little time to turn on and start up fully. (I expected this because it being new and all). Finally when I got it to start to start inputting my information things ran smoothly and it was quite fast. The battery life seems to be good on a full charge I can go almost the entire day without needing to charge again and I use it regularly for school and to check emails so I say the description of battery life is accurate.My only issue is that I get Microsoft 365 through my school and I can't seem to get to any of the apps like Microsoft Word, excel , PowerPoint the computer will not download Word at all and that is what I use for my school work so I've resorted to just using the online version of Word which sucks! Other than that great buy.\ud83d\udc4d",

                "reviewText": "I bought this laptop on Cyber Monday for a slightly lower price than the original price. The computer has really good specs but after setting up the laptop I noticed that Windows 11 Pro was installed instead of Windows 11 Home that the product should have come with. This was an issue because we were given the product key for the Windows 11 Home instead of what was actually installed by the manufacturers (Windows 11 Pro). This was annoying for the first few hours trying to solve this, but after a quick message to the manufacturers, they gave us a new product key that worked.All in all, it was frustrating but I now technically have more value than what we would\u2019ve originally had without any issues in the first place. Very satisfied with the customer service.",
