                "reviewText": "The screen really is a QHD IPS display. That is basically the entire reason to buy this thing. The display punches waaaay above it's weight.The keyboard is above average for the price ($110). The trackpad is...serviceable at best. It doesn't click in the middle? Kind of weird. Anyhow it works and I'll mostly be using a mouse with this thing.The processor is dual core garbage, but modernish and supports hardware video decoding. The hard drive is SATA and replaceable. The speakers sound like trash.It uses a 12v barrel jack for power. Personally I would prefer usb-c, but I guess there is a whole 12v thing with certain communities, so this may be a bonus for your use case.The WIFI is single channel 802.11n. This means ~40mbps max in the real world. Probably closer to 20mbps. This means that you can't realistically stream video at the native resolution for this display. It's also soldered onto the motherboard and only has one antenna. So it's not realistically upgradeable.I got this thing to stream video games. With the decent keyboard and the amazing (for the price) display, it's soooo close to perfect for my use case. The wifi is the achille's heel. I managed to get it working by using my phone to tether to my wifi. I'm sure you could probably use a usb wifi dongle as well. So just a minor PITA.Sooo close to 5 stars for my use case. But using a 14 year old wifi standard which can't support it's gorgeous screen is gonna cost a star I'm afraid :-/ But still a good value imho, just with a minor thorn.",

I was able to get a small zippered case to store it in. It's light and easy to get around. I was pleasantly surprised when I was offered an upgrade to Windows 11 after setup. I like the color of the laptop, kind of a metallic brown. The new version of Windows makes it easy to navigate and get things done. It has some power for a small laptop. It starts really fast and streams like a dream. You also have a HDMI port. I would like to have had at least one more USB port, it only has two. Another version with a touchscreen would be awesome. I see no reason why this laptop can't see me to graduation.",
