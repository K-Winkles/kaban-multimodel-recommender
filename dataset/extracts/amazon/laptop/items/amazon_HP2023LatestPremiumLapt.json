                "reviewText": "First, the laptop came with no manual or any kind of booklet or anything. I strongly suspect that this laptop was refurbished and I did not want a refurbished one, I wanted a new laptop.I am returning it for a NEW laptop cause the fan inside of it sounds broken. It's making this loud obnoxious noise constantly like it's struggling to keep the laptop cool which is odd since it starts as soon as I turn on the laptop and it's not even warm plus I keep the underside of the laptop circulated. It doesn't not sit directly on anything, I have it situated so that the fan can work and air can move in and out from the bottom of the laptop with ease.The sound of the fan is making me crazy. It won't stop. It's very annoying. It's not a constant hum, it's more like it's keep trying to push itself into gear over and over again.This is terrible.First, it comes late and then I'm sold a refurbished laptop when I ordered a NEW laptop.This seller is terrible.",

I have to keep screen straight up or slightly forward to maintain clear images/color. Poor design in pricey hardware.Dell screen images always remained constant when adjusting screen forward or backwards.HP Keyboard is not as user friendly as Dell laptops. Markings on keys could be better defined.Will go with Dell Laptop next time.",
