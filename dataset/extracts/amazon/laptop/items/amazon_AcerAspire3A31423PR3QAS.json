                "reviewText": "This has been an absolutely great laptop for me. It's plenty fast enough for normal use, I find 14\" to be great for portability, the screen is nice and bright, the trackpad works great, they keyboard has a sensible layout and feels nice, there's pretty good port selection, and the overall look-and-feel are great. The included sleeve is a nice bonus as well.I already have a gaming desktop, so my main usage for this is when travelling, and sometimes if I'm not in my office it's pretty convenient to have something to poke around and shop or whatever with. I've also had good success remote streaming games from my primary system with it.I think the main thing here is to keep speed expectations in check - if you're a heavy PC user and looking for a primary computer, you may find the specs limiting here. It's very responsive under normal load, but it won't handle gaming or anything heavily performance-bound. The 8 GB of RAM might at some point be a limiting factor, but today it's plenty for normal usage. As a secondary PC or a primary for someone who's not doing much beyond the basics, I think it's plenty fast enough.The laptop is affordable but to me doesn't feel \"cheap\". Sure it's plastic construction, but it's very well laid-out. I haven't had any quibbles over the physical layout or construction, and if I'm being honest the performance is a bit more than I was expecting. For what it's worth I had far more complaints about my work-issued Dell workstation that costs 10 times this much.At the end of the day I think the laptop is easy to recommend so long as it's the class of PC you're in the market for; no compromises except heavy workstation/gaming performance you can't do at this price anyway.",

I picked out a Mac Book Air 2 and it was 3 times more expensive but I thought that would be better. My Nephew (who builds computers in the Air Force) researched for me and suggested this laptop and I was so skeptical but trusted him and I'm glad I did. This is a great laptop! I love the ease of use and the size and the speed and the screen quality and all the storage! I don't use it for gaming so i can't say anything about that but i needed lots of storage and some speed and it's great. I highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve had this laptop for a few weeks now and its been great so far! Works just fine, plays games decently, and I can get my work done. There have been a few minor glitches that I was able to resolve with turning it off and on again, I\u2019m not sure if those were the laptop\u2019s fault or a browser/program\u2019s fault.My main complaint was the time it took to ship. I have prime and it took two weeks past the original date to arrive, and customer service was really unhelpful. Again, unsure if this is a amazon problem or a laptop problem, I usually don\u2019t have issues like this with amazon products so im not sure. Overall, its a good laptop; just be wary of shipping times if you need it asap.",
