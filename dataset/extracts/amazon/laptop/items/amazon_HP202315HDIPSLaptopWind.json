I read the details and because there was a good return policy I decided to buy it. Second, when it arrived I thought it was brand new. Not a scratch or blemish on it. Third, I had a HP Z1 desktop at work with a solid state boot drive and I had forgotten how quickly this drive boots up. Very fast. Fourth, I work mainly in the Microsoft universe and I logged in and Windows 11 installed everything from my desktop to my laptop (I did have to download the apps to my laptop, but they appeared showing what I already had.). Updates were also fast and painless. Fifth, the build of the laptop is very solid and the display is beautiful. It is also very light and slim. Keyboard and trackpad also have a very good feel.The SSD is only 256GB and it doesn't come with a DVD drive. No big deal. Thanks to HP for not having a ton of bloatware. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a budget laptop that performs well and get the job done.",

                "reviewText": "So far I am absolutely in love with this little guy. Perfect for my simple needs. I'm a 66 year old grandmother that hasn't owned a computer/laptop in probably 7-8 years (only tablets) but with severe arthritis in both thumbs and the small keys on phones and tablets I thought I'd give a physical keyboard a shot. I just needed something simple for social networking, email, banking etc. This little jewelry fit the bill perfectly. The back-lit keyboard was another huge plus. Set up was a breeze, connecting to my wireless printer was no problem at all. And the ability to download apps from the Amazon App Store an amazing and fun find. Now I have both my Kindle and Audible apps at my fingertips. With the 15\" screen it's easy to maneuver in my lap or not take up a huge amount of space on my desk. The Bluetooth option made connecting to my wireless mouse so easy. I also love the color (Blue) which is my favorite color and the blue splash of color carried over to the keyboard area make it look super neat. I did all set up myself without calling one of my children for assistance. Since it is a Factory Refurbished computer the price was affordable for a retired senior citizen on a fixed income. Will update as time progresses should any problems arise1 week later: Returned due to computer froze up after completion of most recent update. Exchanged for one just like it, a month in and an update completed and it's still doing great.",

I thought it meant saving money by buying good, reliable things at a lower price, but unfortunately it means wasting your money. I bought this laptop three months ago because I study online, and I only used it to study and prepare homework, but it suddenly stopped working. Work, and when I called Amazon, they told me to contact HP because I have a repair warranty, and when I did, they asked me to send it to him, and I did so to send a message that I had to pay $317 to repair it, which is the amount I originally bought it for. If this is a joke, it is a very bad joke. Advice: Buy a new computer that suits your budget and has a warranty. There is nothing worse than having your device break down when you need it.",

It couldn't handle my new 10 g WiFi, so I was forced to get a more up to date model. I got this because I'm used to HP, and as it is refurbished, it was reasonably priced. I don't need game speed or flashy stuff, so this seemed to fit the bill. I am thrilled with it. Set up was easy and fast. I was worried that I wouldn't understand the \"new fangled\" apps etc, but there was no issue. None. I regularly Zoom with a close circle of friends and they all commented on the clarity of the picture they were seeing. The battery lasts at least 8 hours on a full charge. And it's RED!!",
