                "reviewText": "For the price it is a good buy for having a backup computer if needed. It is not a speed demon.Small amount of ram and ssd size. I would not use this as main computer since it is so slow. CPU runs @ 100% and ram at 90% just sitting there doing nothing. This I think would be overtaxing components. I also bought an Asus Vivobook quad @ around $450 and am very well pleased with its performance. This off brand computer would be good for a beginners 1st laptop but not good for being used as the main computer because of speed and lacking storage and ram. I hope this helps",

When I received this laptop, I have was amazed by its appearance. It has a very minimalist look which is my favorite style. This laptop has a 512G SSD. This storage space is totally enough for me to use. Because usually I use the computer to record some simple things, or for temporary work. So I don't require much storage space. The laptop has a 15.6-inch display, which I like, plus it's not heavy at all, so it's very easy to carry around. The resolution of its display is also very high definition and I played with the computer for a while and didn't find it hard on my eyes. Its processor is also very good, so it is very smooth in use. So far, I haven't found any problems while using it. I highly recommend buying it.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This laptop exceeded all my expectations!It is solidly built and performs exceptionally well running the pre installed Windows 11 Home Edition.The Processor is a genuine Intel Celeron N5095A running at 2.0GHz which, combined with 12.0 (yes!!) GB RAM and 500GB SSD, make this a high performance and well specified laptop.I tend to use my laptop for advanced office work, running email, Word processing and Excel Spreadsheets. The laptop has handled these tasks with ease even when multitasking as I tens to be a little lazy and leave applications running in the background.The delivery from Amazon was very quick and, being a Prime subscriber, I received the Laptop on the next day.In terms of the packaging and when unboxing the laptop is basic, as you can see from the attached video. The contents of the package are as shown and listed below: - Laptop - Power supply - UK and European adaptor for attachment for the supply (this can be easily attached and removed - useful when travelling) - User manual - 8 different plastic country keyboard overlays (including UK)When setting up Windows 11 you are asked to input your keyboard locale. In my case, living in the UK the, I selected \"United Kingdom\". The keyboard supplied with the laptop is not UK and so, some of the keys do not type the same character on the screen. This is resolved by finding the appropriate, UK, overlay. These can be found in the white box. The best way the identify the correct Uk overlay is that it has the \"\u00a3\" symbol over the \"3\" key, (above the \"E\"), and the \"\\\" on the \"Z\" key. As you can see from the video to type \"\\\" press and hold the \"Fn\" key then press the \"Z\" key. Please refer to the latter part of the video where I show this process.The overlay performed well and I soon forgot it was there. It also has the advantage that it could protect from minor spills and helps keep the laptop clean as it prevents ingress of dirt and dust and can be easily removed and cleaned! If you are not happy with the inbuilt keyboard then you can always use an external keyboard which is connected by either Bluetooth or one of the two USB 3.0, or USB-C, slots.Nice laptop Waicid! Keep up the good work. I look forward to future products from you.",

Plays videos fine, sound is fine.I was a bit concerned about the keyboard overlay but, you forget it is there and - big bonus, it keeps the keys clean!It is a slim case but no obvious flexing.No idea on battery life yet but prpbably OK.Good to have full size USB ports as well as USB C and mini hdmiNot mentioned in the description but it has a very nice camera, and it is at the top of the screen which is a bonus.The touch pad is large and bit too sensitive but that was easy to change in settings.It worked hard over the weekend in a field driving a large screen through mini hdmi port with lap display for our 500 lap mower race (youtube video of the event playing in one of the pictures).To sum up a really good laptop for a surprisingly low price.

After checking this Laptop out, reading the spec, which is very impressive and reading the reviews I decided to give it a go. Well what a great Laptop, very light, high spec, Windows 11. Amazing crystal clear screen.Was a little concerned about the rubber key board cover, but it was a concern that didnt last long. Took me a while to get use to Wondows 11 and set the system up to my liking, but it was worth the hassle and patience in doing it.You want a laptop with a high spec at a low price, I can recommend this one.I am sure there are some geeks out there will pull it to pieces, but it does the job for me. My only negative issue is the virtual touch pad, I prefer the old toggle type, but I am sure in time I will be using it with no problem at all.",
