I could not download non Windows apps. Apps like Chrome and Norton. Even after turning off the S mode I was still bombarded by Microsoft alerts, got those turned off. I reset the computer and did not use the Cloud. The Cloud slows the computer down a lot. Other than the Microsoft issues the HP is a fine computer.",

Once it updates to windows 11, it will slow to such an extent that you will need a book to read while its thinking. This is a common issue for windows on a com with a SATA drive (was supposed to be faster!) The machine comes loaded with windows and the update to 11 is automatic, so blame Microsoft if you want, but HP sold the machine as one that could handle windows 11. It absolutely can not! I literally sit with a kindle fire while this thing is running, so I have something to read while its just poking along, doing whatever it's doing. Less than one year old now, and almost completely worthless at these speeds. Not a fan of chromebooks, but will order one now just so I can achieve the basics.",
