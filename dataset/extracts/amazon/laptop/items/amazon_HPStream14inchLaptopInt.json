I'm downloading all our wedding photos to it so it will probably take up most of the 64 GB of space but I'm ok with that as well.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this HP Stream because my 2012 Mac is dead and I really don't use a computer anymore. My iPhone 12 Pro works just fine for everyday use, and I just can't afford to buy a new Mac right now. So, I just needed an inexpensive little computer to connect to the internet to do personal business and take online classes. I do not intend to store anything on this computer, but rather continue to use my iCloud for storage and Google Apps if necessary.You can download the necessary cloud apps such as iCloud, Google Drive, and shortcuts to Google Docs, Sheets, or whatever you like. Once I got the computer set up, I went in and uninstalled Microsoft Office. I don't care that it's free for a year. Google Suite works just fine.I've used this computer quite a bit, and this is what I think about it...Contrary to the negative reviews, this computer doesn't suck. You just can't have high expectations of a $350 laptop. You will be setting yourself up for a bitter disappointment. With that said....The mouse and keyboard are horrible and uncomfortable to use for my taste. Granted I don't intend to use it away from home very often, but I did a couple of times and it really doesn't function like I'm used to. Also, I can't really say for certain that the wi-fi connections were all that great. It could've been the networks I was connected to. For some reason it wouldn't let me connect to my iPhone hotspot. I don't know if there is a setting that I have to adjust, but it shouldn't have been that difficult to connect.However, it works FANTASTIC when I switch out my work laptop and connect it to my desk set up where it's hardwired to the internet and connected to a USB keyboard and mouse. I am able to do personal business that requires me to use a computer rather than my iPhone. This computer IS NOT built to have sophisticated software installed such as Office, FilemakerPro, Quickbooks, Photoshop etc. It is also, not meant to store large files or photos. It is PERFECT to use cloud based software and storage.I recommend this laptop as an internet terminal and NOTHING MORE! I cannot express this enough....do not expect it to perform in any other way. It's a perfect light use laptop to connect to social media (if that's your thing) or even school, or access websites that you really can't on your smartphone. It's an affordable option as a transitional workstation.Some people complained about not being able to update Windows due to lack of disk space. I suggest that you make sure you purge temporary files, internet cache, and downloads often. Also uninstall applications that you do not use or are unnecessary. This will free up a bunch of disk space. If you are using Office360, this will take up a ridiculous amount of disk space. I know it's free for the first year...but is that really worth your low disk space frustration? While you could get a Chromebook, I'm not keen to them. In a Windows OS you can set up Google Suite. It's cloud based, free, and doesn't have a trial period. You won't have to pay a subscription to keep and all your documents, photos, etc. They will be gone if you don't move them out of OneDrive and to another cloud storage at the end of the trial period. Why bother? Just set up Google account, which comes with free storage, use their version of Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc and you don't have to install it on your computer. WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!",
