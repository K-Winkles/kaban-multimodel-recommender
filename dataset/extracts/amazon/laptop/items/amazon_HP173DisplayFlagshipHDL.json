All I wanted to do was download my Citrix so I could connect to my work Network. The computer is locked it does not allow you to install any apps or any other programs. I was not even able to download Chrome it blocked that too. Now I have to go to a local store and buy a new laptop so I can actually work today.",

In addition, the sound low. I have to put it up to almost 100% when I have it at arms length on Zoom or listening to streaming video. Again, my 2017 HP laptop had much higher quality sound!This also came in Windows 11 Safe mode, which even after undoing, I after calling HP tech support after getting errors trying to install my printer to learn that this still left drivers disabled. It cost me $100 for HP to fix everything.I also didn't like the fact that there are no keyboard lights-- the small things that I thought would just be standard when buying a new laptop.I will say that it runs fine and the performance is good. The built-in HP utilities are useful.",
