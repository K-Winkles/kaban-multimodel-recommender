                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Work Computer, NOT For Gaming!",
                "reviewText": "To start out know what you are buying before you buy it. This is by no means a gaming PC and is not designed to run graphic heavy games. Yes, I suppose you could run games on low settings and get away with it, but I would not purchase this laptop with the sole purpose of playing games on it. With that being said this computer is fantastic for work use and general web browsing! I will go into the pros and cons of this device to give you a better understanding of the uses of this PC. Before I do that I will start out by saying that this was VERY well packaged in the box and had foam around all sides to protect the computer from moving and being damaged during shipping. Honestly I was concerned about this right away but this was not an issue at all and the computer arrived undamaged and well packaged.Pros:-Great graphics and display for backgrounds, internet browsing, and general applications. Also plays videos really well. I use this to teach CPR/First Aid and it loads the videos very quickly and has no issues with buffering or pausing during playback.-Responsive: The PC is very responsive when clicking tabs, opening applications, and running applications. There is very little delay when clicking to open an application and it loads very quickly to your screen.-SSD: Being equipped with a 500gb SSD is a great feature as the drives are very responsive and offers plenty of space to download applications for general use.-Variety of ports!: This is great for this size of PC. This is equipped with 3 USB ports, an HDMI port, a micro SD card port, a USB C port, and an AUX port. This allows you to add multiple devices such as keyboard, a mouse, or even a second monitor via HDMI.-Bluetooth: Being able to run Bluetooth is fantastic to be able to connect to speakers when teaching CPR/First Aid as I do not need cords running all over to get audio.-Compact Size: This PC is super lightweight and compact for carrying around without any issues. My previous PC was very heavy and you definitely knew it was in your bag, but this one is not noticeable and is easy to travel with.-Battery life: The battery life is great and you can easily get multiple hours out of a single charge without any issues doing basic things like downloading, browsing the web, or typing in a word document. I fully charged my PC on January 6th and 5 days later on the 11th it was still at 65 percent battery lite with roughly an hour of use each day and put into sleep mode while not in use.Cons:-Touch Pad: The touch pad on this is very sensitive and will take a lot of getting use to. I have clicked many apps on accident as the touch pad registers my movements as a click and brings me into apps when I am over them.-Charing cord: The PC uses a USB C charging port, but you will need a higher voltage charger to actually charge the PC and can\u2019t use just any USB C charger. The charger that comes with the PC is very short so doesn\u2019t offer a lot of options when it comes to charging while using the PC.Overall, this is a great PC for the price point and offers great performance for work use. The cons aren\u2019t deal breakers by any means as you can add a keyboard/mouse or buy a longer charging cord without any issues. The computer has preformed well over my expectations and preforms as well as brand name laptops. If you are looking for a gaming PC this is not the computer for you, but if you work from home and need a very reliable work PC with a great price point I would highly recommend this laptop!Just a not as I mentioned it in my \"Pros\".. This DOES charge with a USB C cable, but it will not changer with a standard phone charger as it needs a higher wattage than a standard phone charger.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. So, I got my hands on the ACEMAGIC laptop, and let me tell you, it's like a caffeinated cheetah in a sleek tuxedo! Sporting 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD, this bad boy handles multitasking like a pro \u2013 it's practically juggling apps and tasks with one paw tied behind its back.Now, let's talk about the brain of this operation \u2013 the Intel N95 processor. It's not just good; it's like having a tiny genius inside your laptop, making everything run smoother than a buttered-up waterslide. I half-expected it to wink at me when I opened it up, it's that smooth.The design is so slim; I'm pretty sure it's on a secret mission to out-slim all other laptops. It's light as a feather, but don't be fooled \u2013 it's tougher than my grandma's cookies. And speaking of cookies, I can stream my favorite baking shows in HD without a hiccup, thanks to the crisp display.Battery life? It's like the laptop sips power like it's fine wine. I've been binge-watching cat videos for hours, and this thing acts like it's just had a power nap. Plus, it stays cooler than a cucumber in Antarctica \u2013 no burning laps here.In a nutshell, the ACEMAGIC laptop is the superhero of laptops. Need a sidekick for work or play? This one's got your back. It's so good; I'm half-expecting it to start making me coffee in the morning. If you want a laptop that's both a powerhouse and a party animal, ACEMAGIC's got your ticket to tech nirvana. Five stars? Nah, make it a galaxy of stars! \ud83d\ude80\u2728",
