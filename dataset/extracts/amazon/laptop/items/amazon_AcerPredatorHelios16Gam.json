                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars WoW Player Here - Excellent Bang for Your Buck",
                "reviewText": "TLDR; This is an excellent machine for the money if you are an MMORPG player. No regrets about buying this one. It's a keeper.I recently got back into World of Warcraft after many years away and my old laptop just couldn't keep up. I started looking around at laptops capable of WoW gaming and actually tried out an MSI Stealth for a couple of weeks. It was a pretty laptop and lightweight, but man it struggled to keep up just being in a main city. Then I had a battery issue with it and decided to shop around instead of sending my brand new laptop in for work.How I use it: Play WoW, I use it for my side gig (AI Chatbots) and general doom scrolling. I don't overclock or do anything fancy to try to squeeze more out of my machine, other than minor upgrades and settings tweaks.I looked at a ton of laptops and combos of specs and finally thought I'd give this one a try. It had slightly better specs than the MSI at around the same price. This laptop is awesome. It never struggles to keep up at. I haven't done any raids yet so I don't know how it will perform in that situation but I will update once I know.Pros: performs beautifully playing World of Warcaft. Fan almost never needs to kick in, yet it also doesn't get that hot.Cons:Size/weight: this thing is heavy and huge. It packs a punch but you sacrifice portability. Yes it's a 16\" laptop but I hadn't imagined just how big and heavy it would be. I have a 16\" laptop for work and this is far heavier. It feels well made though. Yes you can still carry it around, but you won't want to much. I mostly keep it at home anyway so that's not a deal breaker for me.Battery life: yeah, it's pretty bad. I've been on battery power for almost an hour on \"eco-mode\" and it's down 15%. The power brick is also huge, so if you are communiting or traveling with this often, the weight and size of the computer with brick is going to be a drag.RAM limited to 32gb: I'm suprised such a big and powerful laptop can only take up to 32gb of ram. I have not yet upgraded my RAM yet because it's performed so well so far. I do have 32gb on hand and plan to upgrade anyway. But seeing how well it's performed so far, not having 64gb might not be an issue at all.Can't (yet) figure out how to wake from sleep with bluetooth keyboard/mouse. I have changed every possible setting under the sun, including tweaking the BIOS and it still doesn't wake on bluetooth mouse/keyboard. That's annoying. I have a really small desk that houses to 27\" monitors and two laptops. I keep the laptops in a vertical stand which saves me tons of space, but it's super annoying to have to pull this thing out, open it up and wake it up.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars One of the best mid-tier gaming laptops available!",
                "reviewText": "My gaming rig was on its way out, with an outdated i5 processor, GTX 1060 graphics card (which I paid too much for used on eBay) and 16GB of RAM, so my partner and I discussed what our next PC purchase would be. After much research, I found that the Acer Helios 300 provided a decent integrated graphics card (3060) that could play older AAA titles on Ultra, and newer ones on either High or Medium with little overclocking using stock settings most of the time. Most recently I played the Diablo IV Beta & the Resident Evil 4 remake on High settings, and it looked great on the 1920x1080 screen.On occasion I do plug it into my 4K LG Monitor, or the 4K TV in the family room via HDMI port or Mini Display Port (and doing so increasing the screen resolution to 3840x2160). At this point, its when the overclocking tool(s) become most advantageous. Yes, the fans are a bit loud, but that's normal for these devices. To combat this I pair either my Apple Airpods Max via BT or my Razer THX headset when gaming on the TV. I also use a cooling mat that has a couple fans on the bottom that help dissipate heat.I've also been using this laptop for school work which it does in a flash on anything Office 365. Webcam and built-in mic are more than enough for Zoom calls and proctored exams. This thing is overkill for school work. (Which is just an added bonus.)I've also done a bit of video editing using Adobe Premiere and it renders video files much quicker than my old PC. I'm not much of a content creator, but I imagine this computer would be great for extensive 4K video or other more complex projects.Finally, this machine has several options for expand-ability and future-proofing. Since purchasing it, I have upgraded the RAM to 32GB and have installed a second SSD drive (using the included adapter that came in the box). And I'm happy knowing that there is an empty M.2 slot available when I decide to install a third hard drive for when I need to.I have no qualms about the price, and believe it was more than fair for what's available on the market today. It's a solid mid-tier gaming laptop that's more than capable with keeping up with newer titles. With chip shortages, supply chain issues, not to mention the folks who do bitcoin mining grabbing up all the graphics cards, which in turn jack up prices to insane amounts, it was a no-brainer to replace my aging gaming rig with this laptop instead of holding out hope for a better graphics card in the future.",

                "reviewText": "Nothing much to say, really. My main purpose reviewing is telling you about the gotchas in video for this PC. Overall, though, it is absolutely excellent. It is utra quiet even with the fans running at high speed. It does get hot, but no performance issues.What I learned about video setup: There are three display ports in this PC:1. Mini DisplayPort v1.4.2. HDMI port v2.1.3. Thunderbolt port v4 (USB-C).All display ports are capable of 4K @60Hz at least. I run my PC connected to 2 LG UltraFine 31.5in monitors at that resolution and refresh rate. However, the DisplayPort function embedded in the Thunderbolt v4 port is run by the integrated Intel HD graphics card, NOT the nVidia RTX3060 card. This is VERY IMPORTANT for gaming: The Intel integrated graphics card will NOT support DirectX 12 Ultimate.On the other hand, displays connected through ports 1 or 2 above will be un by the nVidia RTX3060 card that does support DirectX 12 Ultimate. The difference is night and day. True, I am not loading the most hardcore games ever, but still. So you get a frame of reference, my main 2 games are Age of Empires II DE and Age of Empires IV. I run both in full desktop mode, meaning the 2 monitors treated as one big monitor. AoE II DE reports consistent FPS of 60 (I have V-Sync on, which limits FPS to that of the monitor's refresh rate) with all graphics settings on. AoE IV does not seem to have a way to show the FPS, but it does run super smoothly.So there. Enjoy this super high end PC at a super low price. Oh, and you MUST use quality 8K-graded cables. FYI, the HDMI cables that shipped with my LG monitors are garbage. Get Vanky or some other reputable 8K cables.",
