In the planning stages of an international vacation, I decided that I did not want to take a large laptop, nor did I want to use only a phone or tablet for web browsing and communications. This small, ruggedized, and relatively inexpensive Chromebook seemed like the perfect solution for my travel needs, which fall mostly into the categories of casual web browsing for travel and weather information, and the use of Google apps (maps, email, online voice and video comms, file storage). Getting it running was extremely easy, and Wi-Fi and processing power seem perfectly adequate for my needs. Storage is sufficient to accommodate pdf versions of my travel guides and maps for offline use. The charger will work internationally with an inexpensive adapter, and will fast charge our phones as well. This has been a great tech experience with no regrets so far. (I must disclose that I am receiving a warranty extension from ASUS for my feedback. That said, I take my Amazon reviews very seriously. I will report back if I encounter any issues before or during the holiday trip.)",

                "reviewText": "I thought I was happy with my 11\" Lenovo Chromebook but this new 14\" Asus is a great improvement. The extra screen size makes a great difference. The display looks really nice, the keys and trackpad are responsive. The speakers work just fine, just take into consideration that they are budget speakers (don't expect Bose sounding speakers). The MediaTek chip performs great, I don't notice it's not an Intel chip. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Asus Chromebook, it doesn't perform or feel like a budget device. I highly recommend it!!!p.s. The keyboard on this model is a standard Chromebook keyboard, I ordered directly from Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this laptop refurbished as a backup for my primary (and increasingly unreliable) older Windows laptop. I have had nothing but good experiences with ASUS laptops.Pros: 1) Easy to use for most apps out of the box; 2) Adaptive options (I need visual adaptions); 3) Chrome OS is stable; Excellent camera for video calls (I didn't have to balance this laptop on a box.); 4) fast and no hang ups.Cons:1) Not all Android apps work on the Chrome OS. Microsoft 365 apps can only be used in the online versions which lack somefunctionality; 2) Initially, the computer wouldn't let me log in. I had to reset the operating system in order to be able to initially log in.;If you want to use Microsoft 365 apps on this computer, don't install OneDrive or any MS Word related extensions for the Chrome browser. Any of these will prevent MS 365 apps from running online.",
