The processor is powerful enough to easily handle Raw camera files and the 32GB of ram and the Terabyte SSD make the process much easier than my old laptop. The size and weight make it easy to travel with. I am not a gamer so I can't really speak to that. On the down side, the card reader isn't as fast as my external USB3.0 card reader and it doesn't have a DVD player. Fortunately, I rarely need a DVD player when traveling. Those two things are minor as far as I am concerned. It is perfect for my needs and I'm a fan.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this laptop to replace an older HP model that had broken.It comes with S mode enabled however you can easily turn that off in the Windows Store. You are not locked into S mode. While for some users, S mode is probably safer - I am a power user and I need S mode off.I installed and setup Microsoft 365 easily. I get Office products for free from my University as part of my Masters program.The fan does kick on occasionally though it is quiet and not noticeable.This laptop is snappy and fast. It has minimal \u2018cruft\u2019. Things like links/apps to Spotify, Tik Tok, etc are easily removed.It comes with McAfee but McAfee is crap. Just get Windows Defender. Go ahead and remove that.Keys aren\u2019t backlit. That\u2019s not a huge deal for me. I know where the keys areIt is efficient on battery power.",

It comes with a Dell 'warranty' and the option to buy additional coverage through Asurion, which we did, just in case. After 4 months, one of the pins inside the charging port came out when he unplugged the cord from the computer. We called Dell since it was a product defect, and we are still under warranty. We were told by Dell that they do not cover 'product damage' even after we submitted photos showing there is no abuse/damage, also no damage to the surrounding pins, nothing bent or broken-the issue is one of the pins came out. We then called Asurion to see what they could do and were told, per Dell's warranty, it is a mechanical/electrical issue that their (Dell) warranty should cover and initiated a three way call with Dell. The whole process started with Dell all over again, with them telling us its not their problem. Avoid the headache-DO NOT BUY!",

I relied on Dell support software - finally the computer would not boot up and there was an error message - \" No boot device found\" - I got in touch with Dell support. on each occasion though they give case number, but when they ask to perform tests - it takes time - Agent reassures not to worry we will wait for test to complete. But they leave the chat.The issue was with BIOS - on my BIOS screen it showed different to what the agent was saying. The agent cut and pasted large number of things that I could do though I asked to be taken step by step. Eventually after three days of calls - Dell support did not resolve the issue. Eventually, I got in touch with Amazon, they immediately said they will refund full amount I paid and postage. Amazon agent was very good and sent me labels. In future, I will be vary of buying large 1 Tigabit disk drive - lot of data to loose.",
