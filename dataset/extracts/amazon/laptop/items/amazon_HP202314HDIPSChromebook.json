                "reviewText": "I own a fleet of computers. Several Macs, several PCs, and several Chromebooks. They all have different purposes. Macs for music and video production; PCs mostly for work; Chromebooks for browsing the internet, checking email, etc. But in the short time I've had this $200 machine, I've been blown away by the key features. I write for a living so a good keyboard is critical for typing. This is hands down the best keyboard I've ever used on a Chromebook. Just the right amount of resistance an a great feel. Plus backlighting, which was not a key for me but nice to have. The screen, which is the second most important part of the laptop for me, is crisp and bright. The whole package is lightweight but feels sturdy, and the battery life is excellent. Given that my work has migrated everything to the cloud, I'm using this Chromebook for everything (except video and music production -- nothing better than a Mac for that stuff) and just really pleased with this purchase. Mine was refurbished but there is no indication anywhere of any problems at all -- looks and works like new. The review asked me to describe the touch screen -- but this model doesn't have a touch screen. That's fine with me as I don't like fingerprints on my screen anyway.",

Second, I was very pleased at how good the display is for this price. My last Chromebook had an abysmal display. Thirdly it came up and worked as it should right off the bat. Now I have only been using it for a few days but that is a good indication. The keyboard is great or my fat fingers. I love the fact that the keyboard is backlit. It isn't blazing fast, but it is quite responsive and a pleasure to use. Battery life seems to be about 12 hours or so which works well for me. I had no trouble connecting to my router and getting on the internet. So, I am very pleased at this point.",

Iv actually almost taken it over lol \ud83d\ude06 I'm probably gonna have to buy a second one for myself lol.It's not slow I think it works and processes at a very normal speed. Works just as good as my galaxy s23. But obviously more capable. Works great for all my trucking load boreds and ect.. I will most likely buy another. I will say it's not steel or anything don't set anything on top of it. Don't leave it plugged 24/7",
