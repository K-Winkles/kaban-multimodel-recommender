                "reviewText": "I already read the other reviews so I knew the speakers were not very powerful, but I just needed a lightweight laptop with light up keys to work quietly at night while kids sleep. The speakers are a bit tinny and quiet, but the laptop works excellently with Bluetooth headphones (or AUX). It comes with a bonus mouse, mousepad, and a cute little kawaii magnet bookmark which was a nice touch. The charger looks nonstandard for what I\u2019m used to (very short cord), but make sure you\u2019re plugging into the small round port on the left side of the laptop, not the AUX port on the right side. There will be a small indicator light if you plugged it into the power port properly! The laptop is lightweight, and the screen is super big for the size of the laptop because it has very little in the way or frame or bevel. I powered it up with no issues, and Windows is already all set. Ran a few updates and tried out a YT video on highest resolution (Halazia by Ateez) and was blown away by the resolution and screen image quality. It\u2019s beautiful really. I\u2019m gonna switch to using this laptop to stream video (with headphones) because the video quality is so clear and crisp and bright. The purple outer is all smooth, comes wrapped in clingy protective film (which I\u2019ll leave on until my BTS stickers arrive), and it\u2019s pretty light. I would not treat this item as if it were a rugged built chassis IMO\u2014it\u2019s very lightweight plastic (I already bought a protective case\u2026color matches to F\u00a1ntie purple or lavender laptop case). That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got for now, but I\u2019ll update if anything changes my opinion of this device as I continue to use it! Thx for reading if you got this far.",

She is not a gamer, so she doesn't need to track satellite positioning. And with Barbie being the hot item right now - the color was perfect. It's very light-weight and came well protected in the shipping box and comes with a pink mouse - another Barbie Bonus. It was hard to track down, but the warranty is the very common 1-year duration. On a sidenote, the Barbie stickers that were on her stocking went immediately on the laptop shell.",

                "reviewText": "Love the color and big screen. However, the power cord they sent broke within the first month, being so short that I pulled it out of the port 3 times by accident. When I tried to determine what kind of cord to purchase, I could not find on specs anywhere. No computer store I called had EVER heard of this brand, so I ordered six cords before I found the right size.It froze once and I had to let it run out of power before I could get it to reset. I asked for my money back that time but dealing with assurance is a nightmare. I spent over 2 hours trying to file a claim before I was hung up on, thereby negating all that work.The touch pad is not working again. The first time it happened, I have no idea why it started again. This time it has been 3 days since it works and I have had to purchase a mouse so I can use my laptop.Do not buy this! You get what you pay for and this isn't worth it!",

Some people were complaining that you can't see the keyboard too much, which is partially true but they did include this black silicone to put over the keyboard and I actually enjoy using it. They included a cute mouse which was really nice. I love the fast log in with finger print scanner. I just needed a laptop to work on for my CPA studying so I didn't want anything super fancy and this was just perfect. Love the price point and love the look. Would recommend.",
