So far, so good. Battery life is also good, just as advertised. Of course, it depends on how much you use the laptop, sometimes you may have a 4 or 5 hour long use as it may increase up to 8 hours. Smooth and soft keyboard. Big screen. Maybe the brightness will not be enough at night, but it's acceptable. The quality of the sound is good, but it isn't as loud as I expected it to be. Also, the speakers are located below the keyboard. Finally, and this may not be totally related with the overall performance of the laptop, it said it included an HP Stylus Pen and a mousepad. They gave me a generic brand regarding the pen and they told me they were out of stock regarding the mousepad. I was given a partial reimbursement. The customer service attention was really good. I am completely satisfied with this product.",
