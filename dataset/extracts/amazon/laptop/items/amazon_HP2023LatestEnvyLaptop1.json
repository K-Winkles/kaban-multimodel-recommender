This is worth dropping the review to 2 stars for the time being.I'm hoping this was a fluke, but I can find absolutely no documentation for this laptop. There's no warranty or other information to be found. Normally there are cautions and warnings, getting started, etc. So far, the only help links present are for Windows, not the hardware. I may want to upgrade the second SSD or RAM and do not know if that can be done by the owner.I had to search for the power button - logical location but different location from my 20+ years owning and using laptops. So far I've been unable to find a manual on the SSD either. The only information I have on this laptop is what is written here on Amazon in the product description.On more positive things, once the setup routine is followed, personalizing, installing new hardware is typically Windows so if you're knowledgeable about Windows, you'll do fine. From a complete shutdown (not hibernation), boot up is fast. The computer is very responsive. I'm a ham radio operator and find all proprietary drivers to operate equipment via computer works flawlessly.I forgot the keyboard was backlit and rediscovered that by accident. The two levels of lighting are nice.Again, I'll gladly update if I can find or receive the documentation that I'm sure should have been included. I'm sure I'll have more comments on using it.",
