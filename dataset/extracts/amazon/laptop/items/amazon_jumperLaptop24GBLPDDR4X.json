I was able to run a high CPU intensive game with no problem at all. The storage is superb with the RAM at 24GB and with 1024 NVMe SSD. I also like the fact that is very light weight. As a business traveller myself, this lab top came in handy. It fits well on the small tables on planes, and also very light to carry around. The price was a little high for being a not usual brand of laptop. But, I am very satisfied about the Performance, features and style of this laptop. It has a modern look and shape. Based on my experience so far, I would recommend this laptop for all those cpu lovers.",

Great for the money\u2026 as long as it lasts. We shall see. If you wait for a review in a year this computer will be obsolete. So they\u2019re all kind of a crap shoot. This one seems good.",
