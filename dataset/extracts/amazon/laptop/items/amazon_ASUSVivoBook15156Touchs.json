                "reviewText": "At first I was skeptical because I couldn\u2019t find anything on asus that had a 24gb ram vivobook so I was thinking it was going to be just a normal 16gb version. Lo and behold, it was true to spec 24gb Ram with 1TB memory! I regret not buying the 40gb ram as that would have been nice to have for speed and efficiency. But the 24GB of ram will be plenty for what I need this laptop for.Only complaint I would have is I wish the power/HDMI was on the left side of the computer due to my secondary display being on the left side that\u2019s setup for my work computer. also wish it had an Ethernet port but when it\u2019s priced like this, you aren\u2019t going to get all the bells and whistles. But I can live with it.",

I wouldn't want to type a book out on it, but for normal typing needs, it's fine. There are some \"Do this first when you get your laptop\" videos on YouTube that I recommend to help you turn off some Microsoft's tracking, etc. I paid $600 with tax, and think it's a good deal. Will update my review if I have any issues.",
