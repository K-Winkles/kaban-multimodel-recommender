                "reviewText": "For $500 I expected more. With the brightness turned all way up the screen is still very dull/ poor graphics for everyday work. The battery life says 11 hours in description, it doesn't withstand half of that. It lasts about 4 hours max, and I haven't even installed many things on it. By this laptop having a lot of space on it, with time I feel as if I install things, the battery life will lessen. With me working from home within a few hours, I'll be charging this laptop up to continue with my work day. I really could've looked past the quality and feel on the keyboard being low quality made, but the screen quality and battery life is what steered me to write this review. I love how dimension of the laptop. I love the overall color of it. BUT the battery life and graphics need to be fixed. Don't advertise 11 hours if it goes up to 4 hours MAX.UPDATE: 2/14/23 I have had this laptop for a month and a half now. I use it almost everyday, I have never did anything to destroy it. The screen is completely dim to point of me can\u2019t even seeing what is says without holding a flashlight to it. I can\u2019t use it. It has to be fixed! Mind you, this happened just one day out of nowhere. The brightness is turned all the way up and the screen is dimmm. I contacted the customer service number that\u2019s attached. A representative was rude and basically led me on to thinking they would fix it. She later said that since my purchase is beyond the \u201crefund\u201d timeframe, even though I didn\u2019t want to return it, they can not do anything to help me. I was told to contact HP. For $500 this is crazy. This laptop malfunctioned within 6 weeks, not at my fault and there is nothing the seller can do to fix it.",

It is much faster than my previous HP laptop, the video and sound quality are good for what I need to use it for, and it is light enough for me to take anywhere, without it being too difficult to carry. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t give up on HP. This was a good value for the money I paid and I\u2019m grateful I didn\u2019t have to buy a super expensive laptop with what I\u2019m trying to use it for.",

Screen quality is adequate, but I do not plan on using this laptop outdoors. Keyboard has a nice feel. Separate numeric keyboard helps. Trackpad works well, but I am used to working with a mouse.I did have to hardwire the computer to my router to set it up as it did not recognize my wireless network. After setting that up I was easilyable to connect wirelessly. Sound is surprisingly good for a laptop, but I will probably use hesdphones to listen to music.",
