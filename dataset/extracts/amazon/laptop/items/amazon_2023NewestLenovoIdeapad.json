                "reviewText": "I'm a casual gamer, really like to play but mostly old games and also like a powerful yet not so flashy laptop for work. I was a bit biased on Dell, not the best as every know but they have interesting things in this budget and my last Dell laptop did work for good 5 years (with bad thermals and underclocking the intel cpu), but Lenovo got my attention with this combination of Ryzen cpu and Nvidia gpu.This unit is extremely powerful and well done. Seems that Lenovo is doing a really good job with the thermals. The laptop is pretty functional, sturdy, not very heavy and a very good screen, mouse pad, connectors, without being too flashy on the design. I usually use a secondary screen so the laptop is mostly working as a desktop unit until is time to leave. Is a bit \"big\" on the back, where are most of the input/output connectors, but I'm starting to like this setup. No thermals issue ATM, no screen issues and when you need raw power the unit totally deliver. Fans are a bit noisy but is expected with this little nuclear reactor cpu.The only missing parts that i would like to have is the Thunderbolt 3 connector for possible eGPU in the future AND also a rear hatch to access hard disk and ram.Some benchmarks with ultra setting at Full HD:- COD Warzone: between 75 to 100 fps.- Borderlands 3: 60 - 90 fps- Ghost Recon Wildlands: 85 fps average.- Forza Horizon 4: 100 fps or even more.- Dirt Rally 2.0: is a very badly optimized game but usually something between 65 and 90 fps.- Windows and software performance is fast as you expect on this kind of configuration.I know UHD and 4k is the new way to play but for me FHD (1080p) is more than enough at this time of my life, would like to upgrade to some rtx 2070 or new 3000 series but for now is fine.",

                "reviewText": "Two year update: Laptop still works great, battery life hasn\u2019t declined. Laptop fan noise eliminated after taking the bottom panel off and cleaning thoroughly.Still a dust magnet, requires regular cleaning. Invest in microfiber clothes and compressed air.Update after one year of use:Still performs well, no major defects despite heavy usage, keyboard and touchpad remain like new. Only exception is that fans are much louder despite regular non-compressed air dusting. Computer collects dust in huge quantities, invest in a soft brush for dusting and electronic wipes.Battery life remains excellent. Case has no damage despite extensive travel.Original review:This review is for the 4800H + GTX 2060 + 16GB ram.Fit and finish is nice, despite everything being pure plastic. Don't drop or abuse it.Bought it MSRP at $1099, and the price has since risen to over $1300, although I did see it at mid $900 during Prime day. Time your purchase right, and don't get price-gouged.Other reviews have mentioned the quiet fans even when gaming. Absolutely true and a real treat to have such low fan noise compared to the alternatives. Very little heat generation as well, so far.The low unit weight is also nice, very portable and easy for the couch.The port placement is also good, one USB-A port on each side, then the rest at the back.Battery life is supposedly 5 hours on low load, and that seems to be fairly accurate so far.The monitor is bright, contrast is nice, response times are pretty good for an LCD.At the price point, it seems like it will be perfect for the 3-4 years of gaming you'd expect from a mobile device.The keyboard layout is very good, but the keys feel \"budget.\" The surface of the keys is nice to the touch, but don't expect a premum/mechanical feel to the key action.At this price point, you're simply paying for the CPU and GPU capabilities, so don't expect it to deliver all the bells and whistles. Also, don't buy a cheaper version with worse hardware. You'll only disappoint yourself. Buy the best hardware they offer for the year or you'll be missing the real reason to purchase this slick little budget laptop.Lastly, Lenovo thankfully didn't bundle too much trashware into the OS. Setup was fairly quick and only McAfee \"Livesafe\" and Lenovo's \"Vantage\" in-house software was preinstalled. There's the usual trashware that microsoft bundles, of course, but that's not Lenovo's fault.This review will be updated at a later date after more thorough use.",

                "reviewText": "The laptop shipped quickly. It appears pretty sturdy, though a bit plasticky. The keyboard is great, much better feel than my work laptop or my older samsung laptop. The screeen is bright and sharp. I'm impressed by the system speed. Proper dual channel 3200MHz ram, fast 4800H cpu. While running a few quick tests, the system was running 4.09GHz all core for the cpu-z stress test. The fans are quiet and the keyboard and deck area were cool during ~20 minutes of gaming. There are always better products on the horizon, but overall I'm pleased with this laptop.Update 5-10-21: I continue to be impressed with this laptop. It runs newer games very well and older games at ridiculous frame rates ( Portal and Talos Principle running at 200+ FPS). The cooling system works very well and the integrated graphics can run many of my games at reasonable frame rates. The battery life isn't that great, but long enough to watch a movie. Very pleased for the price.",

                "reviewText": "The design is beautiful, the keyboard feels nice to type in, gaming experience is great (although I recommend disabling Hybrid mode on the Lenovo Vantage app to get higher fps), fans get loud with high demanding games but is not noticeable with headphones, battery life is okay and what you would expect from a gaming laptop, I like the option lenovo gives for having the battery charged until 60% for preserving battery life (for me it's perfect since I always have it plugged in). The only thing that disappointed be a little was the screen, which when I compared it with my previous laptop had some of a yellow tone in it (it was not night mode since I checked it was turned off). I had to configure a color profile for getting it to a normal tone, although this decreased the max brightness it can give and also some green pixels appear in the screen here and there which I have not figured out yet what they are, but they are not dead pixels. Apart from that the laptop is great and the shipping was very fast, I think it is a great value for the money you pay. Would definitely recommend.",

The machine boots very quickly and runs well. The person plays some online games and does the usual email and social networking and is really happy with the speed and quality of this machine. Small scratch on casing (which was warned about by supplier) is not even worth moaning about as the overall effect is a really good machine for the bargain price.",

I was pleasantly surprised - all the components look like new and it is squeeky clean.I installed Linux Mint when I sarted it up the first time - so far it works like a charm.",

I don't do gaming hence the lack of any score for that.",
