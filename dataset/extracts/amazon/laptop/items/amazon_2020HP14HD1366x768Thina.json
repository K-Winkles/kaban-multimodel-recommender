                "reviewText": "I dislike the fact this computer would fight me every step of the way while I was setting it up. Appearently it was already set up. I know it said this computer would come with several Microsoft Apps. That's fine, I use a lot of them daily at work and at home. It was never made clear that I would be in for a battle to change browers. It's like inviting a person from Antarctica to plan your beach party in Florida. The Microsoft browser has no idea what I;m interested in and the people who designed it probubly don't care. It has it's own agenda and that's fine, but not in my house. Back to the battle.",

It came in 3 days, and straight from the box it gave an easy setup, with minimal effort. This laptop exceeded my expectations especially based on the price. The laptop came undamaged, with a nice screen and comfortable keys. The quality is amazing and has great preformance and speed. This is the best laptop i\u2019ve ever used and i hope you all find this review helpful.",
