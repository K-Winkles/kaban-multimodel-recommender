Overall it's a good value for your money and what you need to use it for. It would make a decent gaming computer but if you are a hard-core gamer go with something computer that does have more power because this while powerful won't be enough to handle the games out there now. Like I said it's a good computer overall and I would definitely recommend it for work or school or just a personal computer that you want to use and have one.",
