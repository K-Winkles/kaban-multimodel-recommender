                "reviewText": "I started using this laptop recently and I've been fairly impressed; it's been a solid choice for my day-to-day use. Ran a benchmark software called 'userbenchmark,' and the Intel N95 processor, 32GB RAM, and the 1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD all held up well, performing in the high percentiles across the board.The design is decent, featuring a backlit keyboard and a fingerprint reader, and it has a MacBook-style look that I'm a fan of. It's worth noting that the laptop charge voltage is 12v, making it super easy to charge from a vehicle. They even throw in a keyboard cover as a nice bonus. In terms of connectivity, it boasts 2 USB 3.0 ports, 1 Mini HDMI, 1 headset jack, and 1 micro SD card slot. Plus, the M.2 door on the bottom makes it super easy to swap M.2 drives, requiring only 3 screws if you want to increase the storage capacity. Comes pre-loaded with Windows 11 Pro along with a decent-sized battery.Now, onto a couple of quirks. The speakers are located at the back, so sound may get a bit muffled on soft surfaces. It's not a major concern for me; the volume is still satisfactory. Additionally, the CPU isn't geared towards gaming, but that's not a dealbreaker for my use. For serious gaming, a laptop with a dedicated GPU might be a better fit. Overall, it's a practical everyday laptop, and I'm satisfied with my purchase.",

My biggest issue is if you move around the house with it, it will drop your wifi connection and you will have to reconnect. This is the only device that I have that has this problem so it is not my wifi. Another issue is the battery does not last long, like not even an hour. This is ok for my needs because I don't ever plan to travel with this laptop but it may be for others. Also the key board is a bit sensitive, as I am constantly erasing whole lines of text. I have no issues with multiple applications open, it moves seamlessly from one page to the next. I would not purchase this brand again but it serves the purpose till it dies.",

I am a Certified Recovery Coach and I work online (via Zoom) with women in recovery, I do this voluntarily, I do NOT charge them! When I received the computer, it seemed fine, I set it up and packed it away until my trip... fast forward to 12/9/23 and it's time for my trip... I got here and started using it on 12/10. Within ONE HOUR, the battery died! It will NOT last more than that... I have to keep it constantly plugged into the wall... then, last night (12/22), the mouse pad went crazy!!! This is the most disappointing purchase I've ever made... now I have NO WAY to have my meetings or anything!!!! I do not have the money to buy another one. Amazon said since it's past the return date (12/3) they won't do anything and to contact the seller... when I try, it just sends me back to Amazon. I don't want anything fancy, I just want something that works! I need help!",

The back lit keyboard is a lifesaver, and it came with a cover for the keyboard for it to be converted to the spanish keyboard which i thought was cool. I wish they would have included one for the english keyboard as well, just to have a cover to protect the keyboard.Battery life isnt bad, i can use it for a few hours before needing to charge it.Bluetooth works great! Sound quality is great too.Charger is shorter than the average laptop charger but i can make it work, so not a big deal.The laptop is also extremely light, which has saved my back.All in all, especially for an \"off brand\", its awesome and it saved me some money when i lost my previous laptop. I have zero true complaints.Also i can play games on flawlessly. MMO games are kinda slow but it still plays well enough to enjoy the game, and rpg games like stardew valley are flawless.",

I have been able to load all my Microsoft office programs and use them without issues. Have also used some photoshop and illustrator without any problems, no crazy renders though, just small things. Started doing some neck arms on this laptop and attached you can see the results. Temperatura have been stable through all test. All core seems to be working well, there are 2 that push more than the others but that\u2019s normal. The 1TB SSD moved quick, benchmarks came back at over 1000mbps read and write, that to me is awesome for anything at this range.The laptop itself is nice. Has a sleek design, and the frame seems sturdy. The 15 inch display is perfect, not too small and not too big. The display also is super bright which is something very important to me because I need to see things as shiny as possible. The keyboard comes with a number pad on the right which you don\u2019t see much in laptops, that\u2019s my favorite feature so far.This laptop is more for regular daily use than any type of FPS demanding gaming. If you\u2019re in an office dweller like I am, this will work perfectly. However, I was able to get Knox and blue stacks on it and I played plenty of android games without any issues. That\u2019s as far gaming as I go. :)",

                "reviewText": "Bei dem Angebot beim vergangenen Black Friday bei Amazon habe ich nicht lange \u00fcberlegt. 15,6 Zoll Display. 32 GB Ram, 1 TB SSD, Windows 11 Pro ist vorinstalliert und nach dem ersten Start bereits aktiviert, Celeron CPU,12. Generation. Einschalten, paar Einstellungen, fertig. Ich bin begeistert. Da ich das Ger\u00e4t erst ein paar Tage habe, kann ich noch nicht viel berichten. Das werde ich hier noch erg\u00e4nzen.Nur so viel: Performance ist sehr gut. Die Ausstattung der Anschl\u00fcsse ist f\u00fcr mich ausreichend. 2 x USB 3xx, Micro Sdcard Reader, 2,5mm Klinke, Mini Hdmi. Der Dolby Atmos Sound ist \u00fcberraschend gut. Auf Grund der sehr flachen und leichten Bauweise fehlt nat\u00fcrlich ein LAN Anschluss. Den habe ich per USB LAN Adapter kompensiert. Es gibt eine Website von Auusda, auf der man das Produkt per Mail registrieren lassen kann und bei Bedarf Support, aber ausschlie\u00dflich per Mail bekommen kann. Ich revidiere hier meine urspr\u00fcngliche Bewertung, weil der Wlan Chipsatz aus welchen Gr\u00fcnden auch immer st\u00e4ndig nach wenigen Minuten die Verbindung zu meinen Unifi Netzwerk verloren hat. Dabei spielte Frequenz, Kanal und Kanalbreite keine Rolle. Alles m\u00f6gliche getestet. Alles negativ. Habe mir nun einen USB WiFi Sick von Zyxel zugelegt. Mit dem sind die Wlan Probleme Geschichte. Kann aber normalerweise nicht die Norm sein. Fazit: das Wlan des Ger\u00e4tes taugt einfach nix. Und ich lasse mir auch nicht einreden das es an einer schlechten Wlan-Config liegen k\u00f6nnte, wenn alle anderen 62 Ger\u00e4te meines Heimnetzwekes problemlos funktionieren.",
