                "reviewText": "Doing this review on the notebook computer just purchased. I'll start by saying that overall, this notebook is actually pretty impressive. I was very hesitant to get an unknown brand, but I'm glad I did, especially for the price.The packing was done well. The notebook was in a little fabric sleeve, and that was inside a very well made bubble pack. I could drop the box on the floor and have no concerns about any damage. When I went through the box, it also came with a USB wireless mouse with a USB dongle, as well as a waterproof anti-bacterial keyboard protecting film...both I didn't expect, but was a nice surprise.When I got the notebook, I went through all the Window updates, which kinda took forever... gotta love Microsoft. I really couldn't test anything until Windows was completely up to date. After that, I timed bootup time, which from hitting the power to getting to home screen took 32 seconds. Not too bad considering it's a celeron processor.The keyboard has a nice feel to it with a fairly shallow key travel distance. The screen is definitely sharp and bright! It has 2 USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI port, as well as a memory card slot. I haven't tested the HDMI port, but not expecting anything unusual with it.The instructions that came with the unit is kind of useless, but didn't really expect much of it. When I booted the system up, there's a note on the splash screen about a free lifetime warranty upgrade with an email address, so I sent an email but haven't heard back yet.It does take a second for Edge to open up, but again, it is a celeron CPU, so I'm not expecting it to be as quick as our quad intel CPU desktop will be, but the SSD drive definitely helps with the performance.The notebook is much lighter than our previous older Dell, so we're really happy with that. It also has a sturdy and solid feel to it (which I was concerned about a cheap feel, and very glad it wasn't).If you need a notebook, but don't need it to be super fast (mostly to use for email and surfing), this is a great option at a great price. Try it out!",

I was able easily download google classroom and other school apps for the kids. It has a 5000 mAh battery and battery life is phenomenol. I have used the laptop a couple of times now without charge. Speed of the laptop is good with smooth transition from one app to another. The 6gb RAM is excellent to run many tasks/apps at one time. Usually kids need to open a couple of tabs and apps at once for their school work. The laptop is very light and sturdy making it easy to carry and take outside. Overall for the price, this is a great laptop. I am loving this laptop so far and I recommend it for this price.",
