(MacBook Air is in the photo.)My MacBook Pro can get very hot and this was a great solution to get air flow under it while working at the table.This little stand came with foam pads, but I didn't need them. Don't want to try to take it apart now, but if it comes apart easily I'll pack it in my briefcase when I travel.Simple and visually \"clutter free\" solution that's all upside.",

I mostly wanted this for zoom calls, where having the laptop below head level does not make for a very flattering view. This only raises the laptop a couple of inches, so not a big difference, but when put on a book or two, does the trick. If your goal is to just get some clearance for heat venting, it would work well for that. The plastic itself is pretty thick and not likely to break, but the connection between the pieces feels a little flimsy. I'm not really worried about it falling apart, although it probably wouldn't take a lot of pressure to snap it. But since there's a little wiggle room in the connections, it squeaks a bit as you move it around, kind of like the sound of a styrofoam ice chest in the back of a car, that plastic friction squeak. But it only makes that sound when you move it around.",

It is sturdy once you snap it together, so I\u2019m not worried about that, but it does creak a little when you move your laptop and you can\u2019t adjust the height. I have other metal stands that I prefer, as they sit a bit higher, I can adjust them, and I can actually put a pen underneath them or a notepad to clear space on my desktop. Rubber stick on pads come with it, so I put some underneath to keep it from sliding around, and one on each of the top brackets so my laptop kind of sticks. This one is functional, but for the price I would look for a metal one that\u2019s adjustable and sits higher.",

It lifts my screen exactly 3\", which helps with my spine condition so I'm not looking downward as much. And the keyboard is still easy to type with (maybe a little easier actually because I can see it better), so I don't need a separate one. I'm happy with it.

                "reviewText": "I ordered this because I have a laptop connected to a VR headset that was sitting flat and needed some added ventilation. I didn't use the laptop much because it was also awkward to type on it due to the way it was sitting flat. The rest helped put the laptop in a position where I can use it now to browse the internet while I'm watching TV instead of using my phone which requires me to constantly put on and take off my reading glasses. I may even use this while traveling because it breaks down into three pieces that would be easy to place in my carry on. Great buy!",

                "reviewText": "I've been on the hunt for a laptop stand that checks all the right boxes, and the SOUNDANCE Acrylic Laptop Stand certainly does the trick. This transparent riser elevates my laptop to just the right height, making long hours at my desk a lot more comfortable. The ergonomic design not only promotes better posture but also aids in cooling, ensuring my laptop stays at an optimal temperature during heavy use.One standout feature is the clear, transparent design, which seamlessly blends into any workspace. It's sturdy and supports laptops ranging from 10 to 15.6 inches with ease. However, I did notice that the surface can accumulate smudges and fingerprints over time, so regular cleaning is necessary to maintain its pristine look. Overall, this laptop stand is a smart investment for anyone looking to enhance their workspace ergonomics and keep their laptop running smoothly. It's a clear win in my book.",
