                "reviewText": "This laptop is excellent for every day use. It boots up fast partially because of the included 256 GB ssd. It comes with 6GB of DDR4 ram and an Intel CeleronJ4105 Processor. As far as the processor goes, it definitely offers an above average performance. While it might not be a powerhouse, it certainly gets the job done for most tasks. I did attempt to do some light video editing, and it did it just fine. I wish it had an extra usb port, but two is good enough for most users. The laptop's 15.6-inch FHD display is impressive, offering vibrant colors and decent viewing angles. The laptop provides an array of ports, including 2 USB 3.0, HDMI, and an micro SD card reader. The build quality is up to par with my other laptops. In terms of battery life, it holds up well, offering enough power for casual use without the need of frequent charging. I'm very-satisfied with the capability of this laptop and would recommend it for a student, remote worker, every day user, streaming movies, or someone who wants a reliable workhorse. I think this laptop is a solid choice.",

                "reviewText": "This laptop was quite a surprise. It booted right up into Windows, so it was like Windows was pre-installed, not where it sets it up for the first time when you boot it. It had an \"admin\" account already created, so had to create my own and remove that one. It has Wifi and Bluetooth, two USB ports, the mini-HDMI out, a TF card slot, and the power plug hole. It also has a speaker output jack that is the same size as the power plug, so don't mix those up. It won't hurt anything (I know) but don't do it. I haven't had any issues with it at all. Battery life seems pretty good and device manager shows all the parts advertised. My only real complaint is that some of the items are listed in Chinese. For instance, when you click the speaker in the bottom left to change the output, \"Speaker\" does not say \"Speaker,\" it is chinese letters, so you'll just have to know that that is the speaker. The laptop is in English, but I feel like it's something in the driver that is writing some things in Chinese. Other than that, it's a perfectly good entry-level laptop that will perfect for the kids for school or even adults for school or light office work. Very pleased!",
