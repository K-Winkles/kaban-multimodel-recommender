                "reviewText": "I'm not an IT Person but I have worked on computers for over 20 years and I'm not stranger to setting them up. I can't use the keyboard unless I have a light on. It's silver and the letters can't be read even with a little daylight. I have tried to download my email address, all three of them and it puts me through the ringer and I still, after hours of trying cannot get 2 of them to open. It insists I use Edge when I prefer Firefox. I should be able to decide my defaults with having to answer the question every single time I open login if I want to change my default. Get a life......On the plus size, the price was right, the camera quality is great, the keyboard touch is okay. I can send it back and I'm probably going to and get a different brand. I'm disappointed in HP. I have used their computer products many times. The only reason I'm replacing my current laptop is because the camera is on the bottom of the window. On zoom or the like, it looks up at you and that's not a good site. I need a camera that looks straight at me and this computer was just the ticket. BTW, I don't usually leave reviews but I couldn't pass this one up.",
