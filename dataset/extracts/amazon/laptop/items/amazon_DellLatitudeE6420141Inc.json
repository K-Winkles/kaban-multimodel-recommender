                "reviewText": "I am giving this laptop 5 stars, as this really is a great value overall.On the positive side, my \"refurbished\" laptop arrived in extremely great shape, with no discernible scratches and fully functional. I went ahead and checked the internals as well, (not for your average home user), and it was very clean. My particular unit was manufactured in May of 2012, and I am thinking it did not have a lot of mileage to it. It does come with a new clean installation of Windows 7 64 bit Professional, ready to boot up and install. The battery seemed in good shape, and passed the Dell website battery diagnostic test. In addition, while these machines are out of original warranty, (3 years), the Dell website is full of easy to use support options, even offering an extended warranty if you wish to pay for it. A machine like this, refurbished from Dell proper, will run $700 to $800. You might want to read the reviews on the Dell E6420 on the Web, as it is a robust laptop, made for travel and not made of egg shells. Fantastic machine.On the critical side, my unit came with the i5-2410M Intel Sandy Bridge processor, and not the i5-2520, (as advertised), and the i5-2410M is slightly slower, with a base of 2.3 Ghz., and turbo boost (sustained) of 2.8 Ghz. In addition, the 4 GB of RAM, (2 x 2 GB modules), were miss matched in speed, so they were only running at 533 Mhz, and not 667 Mhz. I went ahead and changed them out to new 2 new Corsair RAM modules at 4 GB, for a total of 8 GB dual channel memory, now running at 800 Mhz. I was not crazy about the old Samsung 128 GB SSD that came with the Laptop, so I changed it out to a new Toshiba 256 GB Q Series Pro SSD, and I ran an additional clean install of Windows 7 64 bit Professional. The new RAM and new SSD made a reasonably fast laptop even faster. You can use this laptop for very demanding applications without the computer lagging or slowing down. The only area this laptop might fall short on would be for intensive graphics associated with complex PC games, 3D rendering, or intense video editing. For most business and home applications, this laptop will more then keep up.Keep in mind, that if you need any additional drivers or support, you can get it all at the Dell website. I went ahead and updated the BIOS and checked for the most up to date drivers off of the Dell website.Also, be prepared to take some time on the first install of Windows 7, that there will be about 200 to 220 updates needed almost immediately once you get the machine up and running and hooked up to the Internet. On the bright side, you did not get a new laptop with a \"ton\" of stupid bloatware and junk you did not want or need.These Dell Machines do come in slightly different configurations, and are being sold by different secondary vendors. Mine came from TechHarvard, but there are 2 or 3 other vendors selling these as well under this same heading. While I feel very positive about buying this refurbished laptop, and I know I got an excellent value, individual results may vary.Quite frankly, I would buy this machine again, and I would buy this refurbished Dell laptop ahead of most of the new junk that you can find in the Retail stores. If you are on a budget, and you need a great laptop, you could not go wrong buying this unit. If you are not on a budget, go ahead and get the new Dell E6440 laptop, but be prepared to fork over $1,200 or so for the privilege. Trust me, the Dell E6440 is not going to perform much better then this refurbished E6420, and if the new E6440 comes with a standard hard drive instead of an SSD, it will be a slower machine.If in doubt, just buy it.(Edit and Update Jan 2017). I did go ahead and upgrade this Laptop PC to Windows 10 Pro, during the Summer of 2016. I am happy to share that I ran into \"Zero\" issues with the upgrade, and had no driver issues. Even at this particular time of update, a year and a half after I have purchased this machine, it is still running strong and it is a better value than the Laptops you might get at a Big Box Store.

                "reviewText": "Excellent Laptop !! As my current laptop stopped working, I have been looking for a replacement. With the help of my IT friends i understood that Dell Latitude 64xx series is a work horse. Very powerful machine. Little skeptical as this is my first refurbished product in any category. But this company didn't disappoint me. They had sent clear notes on how to boot the machine and register. David even sent an email asking if i need any help. I got 6430 even though amazon description says 6420. Very decent configuration. Hard Drive size is less but you cant ask more in $200 laptop. It comes with 1 year warranty, which is a big plus. Booting is very fast as the hard disk is SSD. Able to setup easily and the laptop was up and running in no time. Overall, i believe this is a very good buy and value for money. Hope Blazing Prices could support if there are any issues. Its been 1 week and the review is based on that. I will come back and write more after few months.",

                "reviewText": "I really wanted to be excited about these computers. I know others who have bought them and are really happy with their purchase, but that was not the case for us.We 2 for our kids to use for school. They have heavier cases and built in cd/dvd drives. Both computers have trouble charging. The screens go black when the charger is plugged in and one of the computer's screen goes dim for no apparent reason. They both run extremely slow and have trouble connecting to the internet - none of our other computers/devices have this trouble. One of the computers freezes on a regular basis making it impossible to use. Neither computer has anything other than basic programs loaded (Microsoft Office, Dragon Speak, AVG, Firefox is all they have on them).Bottom line: they aren't worth the money saved.",

                "reviewText": "Mine arrived quickly and well packaged. I was disappointed to find a dead pixel in the lower left corner, about 2\" from either side (so very in the way).However, the only job this laptop has is to output to a 32\" television in our front room as a media center PC. As such, the actual laptop screen is never used.Had I been using it as a real notebook, I would have returned for an exchange.My unit does have light scuffing, indicative of a definitely used item.Having said all that, the laptop is very speedy. The clean install of Win 7 booted up and has caused me no problems. I haven't bothered entering the included product key, though I'm sure it's valid.I was hesitant to see how well the notebook handled 1080p videos in VLC and YouTube and was pleasantly surprised to see it plays all videos well.All in all, it was a good buy for its intended use.",
