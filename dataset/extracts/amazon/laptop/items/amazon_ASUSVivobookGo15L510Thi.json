After a month of trying various things that did not work, i finally disabled Microsoft edge and installed Google chrome as the web browser. Instantly everything is quick and responsive, no more lag. Apparently Microsoft loads everything they own onto these laptops forcing you to use it. Just remember, you can use aps and programs that are much better.",

                "reviewText": "I am a Chromebook lover. Guilty as charged. Those machines are lightening fast, easy to connect, and never fail. The only real difference in the price points is due to screen size, battery, and touch screen capability.Why did I write about Chromebooks? Because they're everywhere that this machine isn't. The sole reason why I bought this is because most professors are dinosaurs and refuse to accept Google docs/sheets for assignments, so I needed something relatively cheap with MS Office. That was my only criterion. Well, it does have Office and it was fairly inexpensive. However, once I'm done with my classes, I plan to smash it \u00e0 l'Office Space. It takes roughly 10 mins to connect, which would be annoying enough, but then you have to fight it to do anything at all. Bear in mind, once again, I am not playing games on this or watching films. Just trying to perform basic functions feels like pulling teeth. At this point, I complete all of my papers on my Chromebook via Google docs, then boot this slug up and just download my Google doc as a Word doc. That is literally the only thing it's good for.Save your money and either spend a bit more for something that actually works, or use your friend's desktop to transfer documents. This is utter rubbish.",

It can handle at most three open tabs in Chrome reliably, I attempted to open 25 tabs and the PC crashed. It's horrifically slow, from CPU to RAM to the WiFi card. That being said, the screen is pretty decent, I like the keyboard a lot, the touchpad is a decent size (I prefer larger touchpads) and the light weight is very handy. It's got a numpad which is a weird must-have for me, and it doesn't make the laptop massive to accommodate the additional space on the keyboard. The build quality seems nice so far and I appreciate the HDMI port on such a slim profile. All in all, it's exactly what I need, even though it's incredibly slow, I'm only using it to type out documents, check emails, and print shipping labels, so it's doing what I need, which is the bare minimum. I wouldn't recommend this laptop if you need to do any sort of actual work, it should be a subsidiary computer.",

(may take a few hours).. it\u2019s like the experience of the Wizard of OZ transitioning from B&W to COLOR. (Or that 13 Yr old that just beat the Tetris game). Suddenly, with some patience, this is a GREAT BUY.If you need a streaming only computer, or basically an internet only web device, and wouldn\u2019t mind also having the entire Microsoft Office Suite \u2026 this is the computer for you at a measly $170ishI can\u2019t tell you enough how much I\u2019m loving this product. Initially purchased for a College student (she required Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint).. after configuring it I had to have one for my own. At under $170\u2026 ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!! (Basically $99 if you take into account the Microsoft office 1year)In total, 3 of these have now been bought.FULL DISCLOSURE : This is my second review, i deleted the first (last month) only because i provided some I\u2019ll informed advice of how to set it up\u2026 to be honest \u2026 just let it update on It\u2019s own\u2026 and DONT LISTEN TO THE HATERS \u2026 if you are purchasing the Windows 11 offering \u2026 you will not find a better value.",

After you get to the homescreen, it was completely unusable!! Extremely slow to the point you couldn't open any app or browser at all. Completely unacceptable for a new laptop on the market. I was ready to return and purchase another.Before I shut it down got it ready to be returned, I took some advice from the forums and deleted any and all Microsoft related programs. Microsoft teams, edge, anything that comes pre-programmed from Microsoft. I'm currently using Google Chrome as my default browser and not touching Microsoft edge at all. This will save your laptop and now it is running smooth like a laptop should. Completely fixed all performance and speed issues.Anyone who buys this laptop needs to ununstall all Microsoft programs off of the laptop because that is what is causing it to be extremely slow! Otherwise, you will have a nice smooth, easy to use laptop!",
