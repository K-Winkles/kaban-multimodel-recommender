I'm upset I wasted my money but we all learn. It can barely type sometimes and will just shut off every three hours. Plus the battery life is awful. I've taken it to two people to fix it and they tried and it's just the specs on it that are terrible. DO NOT BUY TRUST ME. plus it is cheap plastic so doesn't even feel good \ud83d\udc80",
