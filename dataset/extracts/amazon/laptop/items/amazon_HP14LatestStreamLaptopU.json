I like the SD module that came with it, gives me an extra option for backup. The one thing I struggled with was adding certain programs outside of the Microsoft store, but once I figured it out everything worked good. The laptop was preconfigured in S Mode, which kept pointing me to the Microsoft verified applications. Once I found out where to turn it off it was smooth sailing. It doesn't come with an Ethernet port, so I used a USB port with USB & Ethernet port connector. I like the Ethernet connection, but setting up using wireless worked good. I hope this helps.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this computer for working from home. I just need to access the intranet and a shared drive. I don't do much that requires me to use the space of the computer. So space to save is not an issue. I also just need it to watch Netflix while on down time. This computer is the slowest computer I have ever used. It takes FOREVER to load a page. It takes FOREVER to even pull up Outlook to look at my emails. It takes FOREVER to pull up TEAMS. This by far is the worst purchase I have ever made. I started the computer to get it up and running for work and about an hour in I gave up and closed the computer. It took me an hour just to sign in to Outlook and try and pull up Teams.Save your money and DO NOT BUY this computer. Only if I could return it and get my money back.",

This laptop is incredibly fast and responsive, making multitasking a breeze. I also love the variety of connectivity options, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, HDMI, RJ-45, and USB type A & C. The webcam is high-quality and works excellently for video conferencing. Overall, I highly recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a reliable and high-performance machine. I can't stress enough how exceptional the low price point is for this HP laptop. It's one of the reasons I decided to purchase it, and I'm so glad I did. For such a great price, I got a high-quality, reliable laptop with all of the features it includes.",
