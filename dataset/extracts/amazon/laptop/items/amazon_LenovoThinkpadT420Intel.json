                "reviewText": "I did not expect to receive the quality of product I was sent for such a low price! The product description is spot on, it comes with Windows 7 Pro SP1, 8GB DDR3 RAM, and a lightning fast Intel Core i5 clocked at 2.5ghz. This isn't something that you should expect in a laptop that ships for a little over $300! The overall product build is sturdy, very few visible light scratches on the case, and all the pixels on the display seem to be in working order. I don't often review products, but considering this was my first go at a refurbished laptop I couldn't be more happy! I highly recommend the Thinkpad T420 from Park Deals.Update 2/1/2016: I've had this Thinkpad for awhile and it still works perfectly, I opted to switch to a 128GB SSD that really makes this laptop fly for $50,. The one issue I came across was that the internal microphone didn't work, but after updating the driver from Lenovo's website it works again. I'm considering upgrading the RAM to 16GB, I heard it takes 1333mhz 204-pin SODIMM, I might give it a try, but this thing still is a fast computer with 8GB of RAM and the only thing I think it lacks is a Dedicated Graphics Card, but for a little over $300 I can go without it for most practical applications.",

                "reviewText": "I received the t420 laptop and could not find the Windows product license key sticker on the bottom side. I emailed refurbsupport@metropc.com and got a very fast response that the sticker is under the battery.Just needed to download and apply windows 7 updates from there.The performance is very fast. The computer also boots up and shuts down very fast. (I have the same pc at work which runs a lot of applications at times, and it still does great with 8 GB ram).There is a glittery black sticker covering full top surface of lid, but does not look bad with it. The sticker appears robust and has well aligned cutouts for the Lenovo/Thinkpad symbols as well as the battery/sleep indicator lights. I am not sure but I assume it gives it a new look if there might have been light scuffs.In short: The sticker is fine with me : )Everything else has the original look and is in very good condition. The lid hinges are nice and stiff like new. Have not gotten around to testing battery life yet, but just based on some other reviewes it seems like many people expect more than 2 hours on a full charge. All I can say is that with the same high capacity battery, my t420 at work will last about 1.5 hrs of use.",

                "reviewText": "Needed a new machine for the office to replace the old Vista clunker for spreadsheets and word doc proposals. My kids run Thinkpads for school, and I was impressed by the build. My machine was running Windows 10 (not 7) and was upgraded to 8 gigs of RAM as advertised. The hard drive has enough space for work files and the years old processor is plenty snappy for office stuff. There were some scuffs here and there as well as dust in the hinges- however the machine booted up and is running flawlessly. The T420 is a 2011 produced machine (I think?) so come on guys, at that age there will likely be some superfical scratching here and there. The keyboard feels flawless new and is really \"clicky\", and the screen is fine. It picked up the printer and mouse no sweat, and gets a wi-fi signal at a decent range. at $210, its a great option for productivity- just don't plan on DOOM at 60 fps.",

                "reviewText": "Recieved my t420 from klamp electronics fulfilled by Amazon, it didn't take me more than 10 seconds after it booted for me to figure out there were multiple tiny black spots on the screen indicating dead pixels. On top of that, anytime I scrolled down a webpage or had any kind of video playing, a certain section of the screen would continually flicker. Those are major problems for me considering I paid 280 dollars for a \"certified refurbished\" laptop that wasn't supposed to have problems. I also noticed a few days after the price went back up to 320, which is a complete rip off considering I got the same t420 laptop at a local refurbishing company near me for 140 DOLLARS LESS (180$), for a laptop that looks amazing, has no signs of wear and tear and a beautiful screen, unlike the one I received from klamp electronics which was visibly heavily used, had multiple areas showing signs of wear, keys that were bent, and an extremely defective screen. They offered to replace it after a few days of badgering them, but after I thought about it, I couldn't see why I would take another chance on a company that would send me this laptop in the first place. I ended up going on Craigslist and getting THE SAME LAPTOP, IN WAY BETTER SHAPE FOR 140$ LESS. I realize some people have received very nice laptops from klamp but do keep in mind, YOU MIGHT NOT GET A GOOD ONE!!! terrible experience, terrible price, terrible product.
