My Windows laptop died at a time when I really needed one and I saw this and thought what the heck, I'll give it a try.I'm very pleased. For online use, it's absolutely fine. The screen resolution isn't up to my Mac, but my Windows laptop wasn't either. I don't really like that I'm logged on to Google (and being tracked) whenever I use it, but I don't do anything online that I'd be ashamed of so I guess that's OK.It was a little bit tricky to get online for the first time, but that's pretty well documented out on the web, and it was easy to get beyond the issue. Not really anything to worry about.The battery life is very good. Haven't used the camera, so I don't know about that. But it's lightweight and portable and runs plenty fast. I think it's a very good value.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m an elementary school teacher who uses google drive for planning & bought this chromebook to function as my planning tool, for email communication, internet surfing, and to transport back and forth from school/home. I\u2019ve only had it a few days and it\u2019s great!! I never write reviews and I was hesitant to buy because of some of the negative comments about the \u201ctech specs\u201d of this chromebook (idk what they mean anyway). Honestly, it\u2019s great. I can make my slide shows, view videos, and work with all my TPT resources in my drive. Mine was carefully packaged and in perfect condition. It was so easy to plug in and start working! In my opinion- it looks great too! My boyfriend didn\u2019t know I bought it and when he walked in the door and glanced he said \u201cWait did you get a new MacBook?\u201d Before he saw the \u201cHP\u201d lol! It\u2019s a great little chromebook if you\u2019re looking to do similar day-to-day things for your classroom! I can\u2019t speak to its Zoom capabilities though I haven\u2019t tried it (and hopefully that\u2019s all behind us now).",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased seven laptop/chrombooks last three years. The PCs have not fared good. One died and another is on its last leg, as the screen became detached from the keyboard. The only one that remains on the PC scale is an 11.6 HP I bought after this one which is super slow and has a poor camera. The Apple is ok but needs a battery. Then I have four chromebooks of different sizes from 11.6 to 15.6. This fits in the middle at 14 inches. The design is slick and very flat. It looks like a mac. It feels lighter than the others which are described as heavier. I think because of the design. It has a white keyboard which is the best thing next to a lit keyboard. I purposely looked for a white keyboard. The computer works fine dependent on what you want to do. I like to do light programming, store and edit pictures, writing, internet, music, movies, and games. It is not a powerhouse but it can do alot more than the HP PC I also got (11.6) for about the same price. This works so much better. It works better than the other chromebooks. The camera is better than the HP PC. But the best thing is the amazing battery life. You will get 12 hours easy. The battery does not drain when closed. Other chromebooks have died after a couple of days of just being closed. Not this one. It uses the same plug for my android. This gives you charging options virtually everywhere.Overall a good purchase. Best Chromebook I got and better than the 11.6 HP PC. The apple beats it of course, but the battery on this one makes up for any glaring deficiences.",

I have had it for a little over 10 weeks now and I am so pleasantly surprised with the quality of this (cheap) laptop. The battery life has been outstanding. If you are a fan of Chromebooks and need a cheap/conventional laptop-- this one is for you! The only thing I would be aware of is that some applications for students in college might not be compatible with a chrome book, so I would just make sure to figure out what you're needing a laptop for and if the chromebook is compatible. As far as using Microsoft, Word, Teams, Zoom and other \"common\" school apps-- this laptop is very reliable!",
