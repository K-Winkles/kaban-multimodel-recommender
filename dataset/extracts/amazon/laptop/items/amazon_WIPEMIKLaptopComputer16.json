My only \"complaint\" if you want to call it that, is the layout of the numeric keypad. As notice in other reviews, the zero key is right of where it by standard is and the decimal key is above the numeric keys. I would also add that I miss having an Enter key on the numeric keypad. Very little documentation provided, like a Quick Start Guide, but really not needed. Turn it on and it runs you right through the process, quickly and easily. I also would have preferred a longer AC power chord. All pretty minor things in the overall, but enough to bring the reveiw down from a 5 Star.I also noticed that the USB ports were quite tight and difficult to get anything connected or disconnected, though they have lossened up a bit with use. After several contacts with Support and their response to my concerns I am impressed with their quick response time and concern regarding my comments I have raised my rating up to 5 Stars.",

One of the few inexpensive laptops that actually still has an Ethernet port. The power cord is only about 5 feet. Big annoyance is the non-standard layout of the number keypad. The point of having that is so you can enter numbers quickly. But the zero is not under your thumb and the decimal point is ABOVE the keypad. Very weird.",
