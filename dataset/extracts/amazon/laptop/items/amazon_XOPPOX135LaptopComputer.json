                "reviewText": "This is the best laptop I have ever tried. What I like most is the aspect ratio of the screen. It is actually usable for work. I can write documents, do spreadsheets, etc. easily. None of that wide-screen movie watching. The resolution is fantastic as well--I can read tiny scripts. The size and weight are perfect. I only wish the CPU speed was higher at 2.0 GHz or better. This one runs at only 1.0 GHz.The only problem I have had is that I cannot get Windows 10 to connect to my Wifi router. I have spent weeks trying different settings, etc. but to no avail. My modem/router is an old DSL model using 802.11b/c protocol and this laptop is fixed with a Realtek Wifi chip using 802.11ac protocol. The laptop sees my network and others alright, but I cannot connect. I have decided to return this laptop before the return window closes. Besides, I already have a desktop PC running Windows 10 Pro anyway. (The only way I was able to connect to the internet was to purchase a wired-ethernet-to-USB-C adapter and use that instead.)Update: I have decided it is time to switch ISP providers, get rid of the ten-year-old 12Mbps DSL modem/router, upgrade to the newer protocol, and get 50 Mbps for less cost (I don't need anything faster than that). Then, I might later reconsider buying this laptop again (if Xoppox upgrades the CPU) and possibly install Linux.",

                "reviewText": "I have been unable to track down any way to contact the seller/manufacturer. My computer has had network issues from the start that i assumed i could fix with a simple download. I was unable to find a way to fix the problem, however, and could not find a contact number to seek help from the seller/manufacturer. Recently there have been problems with the physical parts: the top is loose and only stays open in a certain position. Today a screw fell out from the back along with its attachment part that must have come out of the inner part of the computer which was exposed until I gently closed the lid and pushed it all back together.Is there any help to be had out there? I'd sure appreciate it!",

                "reviewText": "I have to give this machine a good review primarily as it was cheap as heck, yet seems to work fine so far and has good excellent resolution and supports up to 3000 x 2000 which is nice. I'll come back and remove some stars if the machine dies within a year, but so far so good.Several months have now passed. I use this laptop 2 or 3 times a week, usually while my primary computer is busy doing other things. It still works fine. No issues. It's not especially fast, it feels a bit flimsy so I would not want to carry it around with me all day (e.g probably not ideal for students taking it to all their classes) but it works. The track pad is pretty awful, so I switched to using a mouse, and I would say that one flaw in the design is that the rear of the screen pushes down on the desk when you open it all the way up, but for the most part it's fine.",
