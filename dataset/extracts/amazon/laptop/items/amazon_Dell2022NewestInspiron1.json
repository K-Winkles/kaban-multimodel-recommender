Ok now that we have that established.... this laptop is my first upgrade in 6 years. My old laptop is still trying to open the sign in screen. If you are using this for gaming It's probably not on your level of needs, but if you're using this to surf the internet, read your emails, type up some papers, store your pictures and music. I have the 2tb 32gb ram variant and it loads stunningly fast. I am not a power user I don't need a crazy expensive computer. For what I use it for it's well above any expectation I had for it coming in. I do some zoom meetings on it and it's flawless. I transferred photos and videos and still it opens fast and acts like it's got nothing on it. The wifi is solid, doesn't lose signal in range. Sound is ok, nothing special, the screen is nice. There are definitely nicer ones but again $500 computer.... you get what you pay for and to me this is more than I expected at this price point.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first experience purchasing a \"reconditioned\" computer from anyone, anywhere. But one of my \"geek\" friends told me not to worry about it and I trust him. Plus Amazon does offer a decent return policy. The laptop I ordered from PCOnline Renew via Amazon was delivered on time and came packaged very nicely in a double box for secure shipment. Even with my limited laptop experience (I prefer desk tops and use one daily at work.) I was able to get the laptop up and running in fairly short order. Also, I was able to confirm (by going into settings) that I did receive the computer that I had specifically ordered. It does include all the specs that I wanted in a laptop. After a day or so, I realized that there was an issue with the webcam or the speakers or the microphone. I contacted customer support at PCOnline and they were with me through the process of getting it resolved. They replied in a timely manner and even though it took some back and forth messages, they told me step-by-step what to do to resolve the issue. At one point, they offered to send a pre-paid shipping label, for me to return it and have their technicians fix it and then return it to me....no mention of additional money required from me. I cannot speak highly enough about this company and their excellent customer service and I would not hesitate to order from them in the future!",
