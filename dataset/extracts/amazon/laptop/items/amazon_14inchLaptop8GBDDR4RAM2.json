                "reviewText": "My child is a Roblox fanatic. That\u2019s all she loves to play. To hear her constantly complain about how slow this gamer PC was became so draining. As a precaution, I scan the system files prior to downloading anything on the laptop, I do this with ALL computers and laptops I purchase. While doing a PC scan we discovered corrupted files. Big no-no for me. I was not expecting that from a brand new laptop. I sent it back for a refund. As of now the laptop has been received and is being processed. I didn\u2019t have to pay for the return so that was why I rated it a 2. I guess I\u2019ll have to save up a few more hundred for a top-tier laptop for her \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f For now, she\u2019s back to taking over my MAC \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude21 It was in perfect condition from the outside view but had some things going on in the inside.",
