                "reviewText": "After my 2 year old got ahold of my 2020 MacBook Air and caused complete water damage to it, I was forced to get this HP laptop as a replacement since I\u2019m a student and couldn\u2019t afford to go out and buy a new apple product. I had high hopes for this computer considering it\u2019s good reviews.Immediately upon setting up, I received a message on the display saying that the battery storage capacity was low and that the battery would likely have to be replaced soon since it was old. Not what you expect when you\u2019re buying a new computer but okay. I figured I would just exchange it for a new one once I got my school assignments for the week completed.Yeah, no. This computer was slow in all aspects, took incredibly long to start up, opening the internet browser took FOREVER, and it just felt so cheap overall. Never again. I found a used MacBook on offerup for about the same price as this one and decided to just purchase that and return this crappy computer.Take it from me, get something else. Im pretty tech savvy, being a 23 year old college student and I still couldn\u2019t make this computer work.",

It is still a nice system even though it is not crazy expensive. For everyday Office programming and internet browsing, it will last a long time.",

However it is actually Windows 11 S-mode which makes it impossible to download any app that is not in the Microsoft store. After an hour of trying to download an app I use everyday I finally found a way to turn off S-mode. Real pain.If you don't want to deal with Big Brother Microsoft get a computer that doesn't have S mode.In the web title it does read Windows 11 S but nowhere else & not in the specs",
