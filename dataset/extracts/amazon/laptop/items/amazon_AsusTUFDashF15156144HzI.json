Mic test with noise cancellation proves to be really bad, so you're better off with something like Nvidia Broadcast or just getting a normal microphone like a Fifine or a yeti,; a gaming headset like a Sennheiser or Hyperx; or even just normal headsets like Koss or Bose.It'll run a ton of games.

It is thin and light weight and currently much cheaper than through other sellers. It does come with Windows 11 which is a bit of a bummer but with a few tweaks most of the issues are solved. It handles Rust like a champ and will be playing a few other games soon on it as well.",
