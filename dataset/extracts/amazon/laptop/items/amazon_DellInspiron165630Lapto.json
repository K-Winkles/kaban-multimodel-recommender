                "reviewText": "I'm writing this review with sheer disappointment about my recent Dell laptop purchase, and I want to make sure others are aware of the nightmare I've endured.The laptop, which was delivered on November 25th, initially seemed promising with its sleek design and lightweight build. However, any optimism quickly turned to frustration when the laptop suddenly died on January 4th, out of nowhere. No physical damage, no spills \u2013 it just stopped working. My work, dependent on this machine, came to a screeching halt.Dell's response was to replace the motherboard on Friday, January 5th. Great, right? Wrong. The laptop showed signs of life for the rest of the day but decided to die again on Monday. At this point, my patience was wearing thin.I sent the laptop to Dell's repair center for a thorough inspection. A week later, on January 11th, I received a call informing me that they had replaced the motherboard. Again. This is unacceptable for a work computer \u2013 the one I rely on daily to get things done.To add insult to injury, the laptop was stationary in my office and wasn't even in use over the weekend. The level of frustration I've experienced is beyond words",

                "reviewText": "After only 5 days of usage where it was immobile on a desk, a black screen appeared and there was no power.Spent over 2 hours with Dell support troubleshooting the issue. After I told them there was no power, they had me repeatedly push all kinds of combinations of keys. They had me unscrew the back cover and remove all of the RAM, and disconnect the motherboard from the battery. Not surprisingly, since there was no power going into the unit, nothing worked.They then suggested that I mail it to Toronto and that they would repair and return it in 10-15 business days. When I said I could not go 3 weeks without a computer, they said they would replace it, but that it would take 10 days. I agreed, though not happy with the delay.I got an email from them asking for an invoice. I sent the Amazon invoice and they waited 24 hours to tell me they would not accept the invoice from Amazon.No choice now but to return it to Amazon and get a refund since Dell will not accept my Amazon invoice.Overall, I\u2019m shocked that they sell such defective products and then make it difficult for you to get any resolution.Amazon should let you give a zero or negative score for situations where both the product and service are extremely poor.",
