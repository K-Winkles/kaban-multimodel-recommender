                "reviewText": "First off, I want to say that I am a diehard Apple user. This HP 2022 Stream 14\" is the first Windows product I've ventured into in a long while. My main motivation to switch things up was to see the contrast in user experience between a Windows laptop and an Apple one.One thing that definitely drew me to this laptop was the price tag. Unlike its Apple counterparts that can run into the thousands, this HP laptop was an affordable $319.00. That's incredible value for money!However, there was an immediate downside I noticed: the absence of a keyboard backlight. With my not-so-great eyesight, a backlight would have been a big help. Despite that, the laptop itself feels light, even more so with the protective case I added.In terms of battery life, I manage to squeeze out a good 4 hours, especially with tasks like schoolwork and Zoom meetings. As for the Windows system, it's taking some readjusting, but overall, the laptop has been holding up well. It's been a worthwhile shift, and I appreciate the balance of cost and functionality this HP offers.",
