                "reviewText": "I ordered the 2 pack. They arrived quickly, appropriately packaged, and mostly assembled. All I had to do was insert the metal supports for the top shelf into the base, attach the included suction cups to the bottom and hang (literally) the top shelf. The suction cups work great and keep the unit in place when pulling and pushing the bottom shelf forward and back. The bottom drawer slides forward for easy access to things stored in the back. One drawer slides smoothly, the second not so much, but I can live with it. The organizers are sturdy and hold everything that I had in the cabinet. The top shelf is large enough to hold plastic canisters of wipes, sponges, bars of soap, powdered cleansers,, etc. I can see and access everything easily. I am happy with these organizers and would buy them again.",

It\u2019s a little flimsy but will work for what I\u2019m using it for. If you are going to take things out of it and slide the drawer a lot, go for a more sturdy model. Well worth the price though.",

I\u2019m keeping them because I think they are useable & I\u2019m being very lazy but they seem smaller than I imagined..so get out the tape measure & it\u2019s 11 x14 each. So those pics of the under the sink space on line must be a VERY SMALL..and I live in an apt so my under the sink is small..so not sure what those online pics are about? Because 11 x14 didn\u2019t go far under my sink. So small & felt wobbly & wonky..don\u2019t expect any kind of sturdy here. No way. The metal is sturdy but nothing else about it is. I wish I had not ordered them but I\u2019ve been under the sink for an hour & a half trying to figure out some kind of yes this works but it really doesn\u2019t and I am OVER it. Not worth it no way on my opinion. No no no.",
