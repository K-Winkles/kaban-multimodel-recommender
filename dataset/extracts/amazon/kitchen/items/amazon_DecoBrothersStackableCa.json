                "reviewText": "Overall this did save space and allowed me go store more cans in the same space it takes up. It is easier to see what we have and to remove it. However, I measured the space efore ordering using the dimensions and it just didn't fit on the shelf I intended. While assembling it felt like it would not be sturdy at all. But once together it is holdinf up ok.On top of that, it holds fewer cans than shown in the photo. I even have the exact same Libby brand corn show in the photo 4 deep, but it only fits 3 cans properly. I managed to squeeze in 4 deep by the 4th can is halfway off the back and only held in place by the wall behind it. If it were just slightly shorter and slightly deeper I would buy more. I'll keep using the one I have but won't buy more.",
