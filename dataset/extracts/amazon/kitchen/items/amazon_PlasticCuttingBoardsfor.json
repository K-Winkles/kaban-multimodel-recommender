                "reviewText": "I was really impressed with this cutting board set. They arrived quickly, simple packaging. They are BPA free, dishwasher safe, and have no -slip on the back. I like that it comes with three sizes so you can choose which one depending on what you need. They are easy to clean & just make sure you dry the bottom well before and thus will help the mat to not move. As for the cutting mat I like that it is a little thicker than most, has a little texture which helps keep the food from moving around a lot. This also made it easier when chopping items. The largest size is great for larger items or amount. I\u2019m very impressed with this product, quality and affordability and I would highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "Love these. I placed the large black one on my electric glass top stove over 2 burners I never use. Protects the stove and I can set utensils there and not scratch the stove. Use the smaller ones for chopping vegetables or cutting meat. So easy to pop in dishwasher to clean. More sanitary. I won\u2019t go back to my wood cutting board. Beautiful but impractical in this age where you worry about cross contamination and salmonella.",
