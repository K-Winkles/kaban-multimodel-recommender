My landlady put it there, and I think it's done an OK job, but there have been times where water ended up pooling enough down there that it was a problem. I wanted something that would contain a bit more water without having it soak into the wood (and damage it, obviously), and I thought this would do the trick. I haven't loaded it up with water, but I can tell it's not going to hold a whole lot. Obviously I wouldn't want this thing trying to contain water all the way up to the top of the walls on it, but... I think it's fine for what it does.Also: The material is smooth, but has a bit of grip to it, so it's not just going to slide around. I actually used it on the counter next to the sink for a couple of weeks because I was too lazy to get all the stuff out from under the sink so I could put it down there. It's pretty nice! I actually might get another one just for that exact purpose. It was really handy to have there.",

                "reviewText": "I love this mat so much more than I probably should love a silicone mat. I thought it would be little small for under my kitchen sink but it fits perfectly (so I must have measured incorrectly). It feels thick & fairly heavy duty but very flexible & not too heavy. I love the high lips to contain any liquid. I also like the dark color to hide any dirt or potential future stains from cleaning chemicals (even though I highly doubt that this material would ever stain - I'll update in the future if there is anything to report but I think any spill would be easily wiped up & leave no trace). It definitely has a non-slip texture that keeps anything from moving. It was actually a little tricky getting my organizational stuff back under the sink & into place because it wouldn't slide at all and kept trying to grab the lip. I have zero concerns about anything leaking or spilling under there now - I know that it will stay contained and it'll be a lot easier to clean up. Everyone should have one of these bad boys under all of their sinks! I highly recommend!",
