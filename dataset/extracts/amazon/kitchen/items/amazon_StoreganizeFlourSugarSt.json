I needed to store some 2 lb. bags of sugar in a hurry. These containers arrived, and I was so impressed with how sturdy they are. They are not flimsy like some containers I have seen. Clear and see through, and the lids snap down tight and seal great. Nothing is getting into or leaking out of these. I cannot say enough; they are fantastic. Yes, you have to snap the closure things on to the lid, but it was simple, and you know it is sealed. They even give you extra snaps, some measuring cups, and labels. I am very pleased. I will buy more and stock up my pantry safely.",

They're tough. However, I will give one mention that you have to kind of put them together yourself with the latches. They all for coming to bundle. They come with measuring cups which I did not expect which was a nice extra. And since I am not using them for flour, sugar and other things.. I have an extra cup measuring set. And adding the latches to the lids is not that hard and it gives a good snap. Good seal. I feel confident that my food items will be safe from the little mices that seem to be poking their heads around my house lol which we now have traps for lol. That's the joys of living in the country.",
