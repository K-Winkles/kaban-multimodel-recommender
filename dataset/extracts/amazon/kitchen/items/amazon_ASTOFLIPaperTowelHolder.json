We're now using 3M adhesive strips. It is very sticky and it can stick on the wall for over a year. Most unsticky situations are caused by low temperatures. if you buy this in winter, please heat the strips with hair dryer before you use them. Do I have to wait for 24 hours after I stick this on the wall? No need to wait that long if you only hang your paper towel on.",

Really streamlines my kitchen and frees up counter space. The fact that it ships with 2x adhesive things that work super well annnndddd quality drywall anchors AANNDDDD black screws for solid panel mounting is just unreal. Thank you ASFLOWGUCI for your amazing product. Or whatever your name is. Amazon is weird. But this product is a total winner. You should totally buy 3.",
