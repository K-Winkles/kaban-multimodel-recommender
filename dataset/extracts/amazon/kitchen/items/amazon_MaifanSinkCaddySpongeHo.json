                "reviewText": "Awesome addition to help keep my kitchen sink organized and clean. This caddy comes in 3 pieces so you can use the taller basket or you can leave it out if you just have smaller items. I really appreciate that the tray is angled to drain and very easy to remove to clean (I do not enjoy emptying trays of accumulated dirty water and debris -- much prefer this method of direct drainage into the sink). It works very well and no issues with liquid catching on the end and running back under the tray -- it drains into the sink only.I wasn't sure if it would fit our Mr. Scrubby sponges (which often don't fit in the in-sink baskets), but it fits 2 of them plus a bottle cleaner and a bottle of soap. So, my scrubby sponges no longer have to just live in the bottom of my sink.Two areas that I wish were a little better:1) I wish the drainage shelf was a little longer than the bottom of the stand so that it would hang just a bit further over the sink. It works as is, but I have to have the bottom of the base right up on the edge of the sink and I am afraid it will tip in if it moves. Which brings me to my second concern.2) I wish there were a more adhesive contact point between the base and the counter (we don't have a little groove for it to sit in like in the company's photos) -- it slides on my countertop. Small suction cups (even on just the back bar of the base) or gel pads I think would have made it more stable. HOWEVER, when I first put the caddy on my sink, it was a little wobbly (base wasn't quite straight out of the package) and it easily slid with any touch, but over the rest of the day it seems to have straightened out with the weight of the items and has a little more grip/friction to the counter as it has sat in one place. So, it isn't as much of an issue as I initially thought it would be right out of the box.I like the caddy and I think it is a great option for my larger Mr. scrubby sponges that often have no place to drain, and I like the design of the angled drain tray. I would not hesitate to recommend this or give it as a gift even, and I actually wish they had a larger version as well to hold even more items that tend to accumulate on the edge of my sink.",

                "reviewText": "My kitchen sink is metal. Every drop of water shows. Water splashes everywhere, and I swear I spend more time cleaning up the edges of the sink than I do actually washing dishes. I really dislike cluttering up the top of the sink with anything, but do keep a small dishwashing liquid bottle, Powerwash (if you haven't tried Dawn Powerwash DO IT NOW!), and a small bottle of disinfectant hand soap on the sink top. I am forever--forever!--moving them to wipe the water underneath. I debated getting this caddy, wondering if it would really work or would just be one more thing on the countertop that I ended up putting somewhere else. But the price was reasonable, it was just exactly the right size to hold the three items (the hand soap fits perfectly into the little spot designated for brushes), so I ordered. OMG. It is perfect. What is especially great is that any water drip from the items in the caddy falls onto the drip pan and is directed into the sink. If I need to wipe under the caddy, it is ONE THING to pick up, not three. And so far, my attitude is that if I don't see water under it, then I don't need to move it and wipe. I mean, realistically it is just water, and removing the spots once a week seems to work just fine. It looks nice, doesn't take up any more room than the items just sitting there (less actually, because it keep them together), and even Hubby doesn't mind it--he thinks I have some need to put things in boxes and caddies, and I do, IF it helps keep it in one place! AARGH! Anyway, this works beautifully for my needs. It would work for you too. Give it a try. I recommend it without hesitation.",

The brush holder is not deep or tall enough to adequately hold the brushes. I love the sturdiness, the color. I really love that the water from the Caddy flows right into the sink. Because no matter how you squeeze the sponges or shake the brushes there is going to be some water. You don't have to worry about dumping etc. It looks so nice in the kitchen. I did have a problem putting it together. There were no instructions or picture and I had to go online several times to look at the picture. It would help if they just included a picture.",

This drains directly into the sink which is great.I could see the design being a little awkward if your sink has the little lip around it. It could also stand to be a bit taller to accommodate longer brushes, but I've made it work. It really is a lot better than the alternatives.",

                "reviewText": "When a sponge can't drain, it gets so gross. Also, I hate grabbing a cold, soggy sponge. I love this little holder that is perfect for my small sink in my small kitchen. It holds these little things that can end up all over the counter. Since my sink doesn't have a backsplash, this little caddy is essential to keep things organized. Also, because it is designed to drain into the sink, it keeps that area dry. I also love how it looks with this other item I got from Amazon: HarJue Glass Soap Dispenser Set with Marble Tray, Refillable Dish Soap Pump Dispenser, 2\u00d7Hand Soap Dispenser https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNWZD8RG",

                "reviewText": "This item has a couple of design flaws that could be easily fixed. First, if you have an over-mount sink that sticks up significantly, it can be difficult to get this to sit with stability so that it drains into the sink. Adjustable rear legs would fix that issue. The lip of the drain could be longer as well. Finally, the bottom drain piece moves around too easily. They should have made it snap on and off.",
