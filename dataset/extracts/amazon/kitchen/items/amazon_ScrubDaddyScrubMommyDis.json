If you use cold water, the abrasive side stays stiff which is perfect for washing things that are really stuck onto pots/pans. However, they are not so rough that I am worried about scraping the finish on whatever I am cleaning. It's the perfect Goldilocks in-between. If you use hot water, the sponge becomes more malleable and you can better get into the nooks and crannies.",

Yes, they cost a lot, but they last forever! I used my first sponges for over a year.2. They are so absorbent! They really keep soap in well and have a fantastic scrubbing ability.3. They remove grease and the rough side removes food really well.I was initially frustrated because they are very stiff at the beginning. However, they soften up in warm water and with use become less stiff in general.",
