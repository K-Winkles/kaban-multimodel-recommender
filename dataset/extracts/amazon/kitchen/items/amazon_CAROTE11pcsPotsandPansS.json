It's soo nice that they're space friendly! It came with pot/pan protective pads that you put inside them so you can stack them in your storage without scratching them! That was a nice touch. And they are nonstick so cleaning them is super easy. Overall great gift worth every penny she cooks me amazing food in them.",

                "reviewText": "I \u201clove\u201d when ppl post reviews of functional items on the day they receive the item. Are you reviewing successful delivery?? Have you USED the item in its full meant capacity?No? \u201cIt just looks cute you guys!!\u201d\u2026.ok,no thanks. If it\u2019s a static item such as candle holder or a vase which whole purpose is to stand there and \u201clook cute\u201d then sure,why not,but pots and pans? Common now :)Let\u2019s get back on track,I\u2019ve purchased this set in August of 2023 and HAVE used it quite a bit. Durability, efficiency, reliability and quality. The set is very affordable for those who are looking to invest into \u201cdecent\u201d pots and not break the bank. For those who care to match it to your kitchen,then yes,it IS very estatic and doesn\u2019t make you hate your life every time you throw spaghetti in it. I can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve used it \u201cproperly\u201d 100%,there\u2019s been a few times where I\u2019ve used a fork to turn a pancake over and OH MY GOSH of course I scratched the surface. Which is\u2026.okay. Because it\u2019s not meant to be used with metal forks and spoons and the packaging says so,so I am not taking any points off for that. The handles are very sturdy and even though,6 months later I am still feeling uneasy to pick it up just by the handle alone if it\u2019s full of boiling water thinking it will somehow unclip and burn my so many times sunburnt legs again\u2026it never happened and yes I have carried a full pot of boiling water ACROSS my kitchen and waltzed back with it to the stove. Bottom line-the handles are GOOD and reliable. They are extremely easy to clean,by hand or dishwasher,so why 4 stars you might wonder\u2026Ahhhhh,well\u2026they ARE easy to clean INSIDE\u2026BUT,the bottom of the pans for some weird reason have this black grease on it that wouldn\u2019t come off for the life of me and oh I tried to get it off! BELIEVE me I\u2019ve tried! For those who made it this far,pictures would perfectly relay to you what exactly I mean by black grease,or whatever that stuff is..scrub it,wash it,nothing gets rid of it. Is it a dealbreaker??No,not for me,but it\u2019s nice to let y'all know in case you\u2019ve experienced that before with other cookware and have this in your cart already :) Overall,decent set and quality matches the price.",

                "reviewText": "I loved these the moment I saw the size of the box they came in! Normally, this kind of set comes in a box that is at least twice the size.This little set fits in a tiny box and is actually very light as well. The packaging was done very well with plenty of protecting material in between. The handles fit onto the pans pretty securely with a very slight wiggle that isn't really a big deal. Time will tell how they hold up. The glass covers actually look very nice and form a great seal on every single pot and pan, leaving room to vent. The plastic covers that come with the set are good for just basic covering, but do not fit on to any of the pots or pans airtight.So far the performance of the one pan I have used is awesome. The non-stick coating is great at the onset and hopefully will continue to stay as strong as it is now. They actually seem to heat up pretty quickly and are easy to wash, especially since you can remove the handle completely for washing. My range is electric so I'm not worried about the handle burning, but I can see that being an issue with a flame on high.I am loving the very little space that they take in my cupboard. Great buy! Wish I had bought these while I was living in my RV and needed space for dishes and pans.",

They STACK in a small space so that saves, so i bought one for my daughter and her husband said it was absolutely PERFECT! A friend boasted she LOVES them in her cabin and got excited to hear we got our first set. The handle works more like your hands so you take it off when you remove your hand, which can be annoying if you're trying to stir things in a frypan but i've served food in these also, stored it, NONSTICK FOR EGGSS though i do use a little butter. One issue may be that it's hard to get greasy residue off and you have to use a sponge without texture. SLIPPERY WHEN WET for sure but I've cooked many things and still nonstick.",

Despu\u00e9s de leer todas las rese\u00f1as negativas me dio un poco de miedo comprarlos PERO presumo que la gente que no le resultaron simplemente tienen cocinas muy fuertes y por eso los han quemado o manchado.En el v\u00eddeo se ve un huevo revuelto con tomate, no se pega nada y calientan muy uniforme la superficie.Tenemos cocina inducci\u00f3n y calientan s\u00faper r\u00e1pido. Tenemos cuidado de remojar despu\u00e9s de usarlos y los lavamos en lavavajillas sin problema, est\u00e1n perfectos.El mango es s\u00faper c\u00f3modo de poner y sacar, y de limpiar.Son muy ligeros, parece q son de juguete, pero va s\u00faper bien si tienes que verter contenido en alg\u00fan sitio porque no pesa tanto todo junto y te las arreglas bien con una sola mano.Leer bien las instrucciones de cuidado antes de usarlo y listo! Estamos muy contentos con la compra.",
