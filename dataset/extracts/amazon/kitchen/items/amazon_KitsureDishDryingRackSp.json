                "reviewText": "Kitsure Dish Drying Rack- Space-Saving, for Kitchen Counter, Durable Stainless Steel RackThis dish Drying Rack is great for what I needed.The pan on the bottom is made of sturdy black plastic and has a spout in the middle of the bottom of the tray that can be moved from the front to the side.This is about medium sized, it will take a few dish plates, bowls, some cups and silver ware.Absolutely fabulous for drying your dishes after you wash them. Put them in the rack and forget them. They will be dry when you come back to put them away.Lets talk about the Drain Spout..............The Drain Spout is designed to be on the side or front of the tray, and be directing water into the sink basin.It does this very well, no leaks.BUT lets talk about the sink.If you have a sink that is mounted under the counter top this will work perfectly.If you have a sink that has that ridge around the sink that is about 1/8\" high, the spout will go over it with no problems.BUT........... yes there are buts in this description.MY SINK has a lip on top of the counter top that is roughly 3/8\" high and the spout cannot fit over that lip.The SOLUTION is to raise the drain tray 1/2\" and the drain spout will fit over the sink lip perfectly.The cheap easy solution to raise the tray would be to get a card board tube that your paper towels come in, and cut it 1/2 longer than the legs on the tray. make 4 of them, then put them over the legs and tape them to the tray.as long as the new legs do not get wet, they will handle the weight. when they do get wet, just make new ones.for more permanent footings, find something that is not made of card board.Now this is what I had to do because my sink has an unusually high sink lip on the counter. But it works great with the slight lift added.Don't think that this drain tray is the problem, it is not. There are other sinks that will not work because of the sink lip height. Most should not have any problem at all.I recommend this Dish Drying Rack absolutely. It does everything I needed it to do.I do not know the seller, nor did I get any product or money for my random review.230915 0207",

I also have very little counter space so when I saw this double tier option for a metal dish drainer, I just knew I had to grab it! It takes up very little counter space while still allowing to place a lot of my dishes that I wait to the last minute to wash! I am very much satisfied with this item, and assembly was so easy and quick! Definitely recommended for anyone who tends to have a lot of dishes and a small kitchen!",

The holes won\u2019t let water drip due to the angle it leans when it is hanging on the outside. I love everything else about it so definitely not a deal breaker.",

However, it is only for very small quantities of lightweight items, perhaps a few glasses and dishes -- and I mean lightweight dishes, not heavy stoneware-type plates. The utensil tray is **extremely** shallow. I put steak knives in with the sharp points at the bottom of the utensil holder, and it is not even deep enough to conceal the entire sharp edge of the blade. Also the utensil holder is far too small to hold more than a few items. Unless you are using plastic utensils or tiny dessert-sized forks, etc. they will be falling out of the holder because it is not deep enough to hold any weight.Okay for the price, but I use it as an additional drying rack for a few glasses etc. I would not trust its stability for anything more than that.",
