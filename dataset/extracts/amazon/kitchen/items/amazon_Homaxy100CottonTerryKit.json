                "reviewText": "Great product that after they were washed they fluffed up a bunch. They are very pretty, I like the dark color so that stains do not show as much! Very interesting packaging that confused me until the first washing and drying. The vacuum packed package is thin and stiff. When first opened the towels are very thin, but when washed and dried end up with fluffy absorbent towels. I saw some negative reviews about the towels being thin, and I would have written those reviews if I had not yet washed and dried these towels. I wonder whether the reviewers were discussing the towels when they are first unpackaged and before a wash and dry? The towels now in my drawer are absorbent and soft and just the size I like for drying anything that I hand wash. Also, the size and absorbency are just what is needed to dry the water that pools in the recesses in the tops of mugs and glasses that air dry after going through the dishwasher. Delighted with this product.",
