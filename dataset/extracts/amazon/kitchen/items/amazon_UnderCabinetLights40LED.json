                "reviewText": "Few reasons to give this a 5 star.1) I appreciate no batteries needed. It has a cord with USB port for charging2) they are held up with magnet strips w/adhesive back. So you can take the lights off and on and don't have to be too exact when positioning under the cabinets. Made for super easy install - Also makes for easy RE charging. It has a button that is red while charging and turns green when fully charged.3) the motion detector works well. it is a little slower than would like, but overall pretty reactive.4) you have different levels of brightness, which I loved having the control over - under cabinetry was more dim, or closet area where i prefer brighter light, adjusting was easy.",

                "reviewText": "I own three sets of these. They work very well. The motion detection is very good. The light is a very cool white (think moonlight, not sunlight), which is crucial because I get migraines from warm light. It\u2019s adjustable to five (maybe four) brightness levels. But they\u2019re in a strange order. It doesn\u2019t cycle brightest to dimmest or vice versa. It gets brighter then dimmer and back again, making it very hard to keep track of what brightness level you\u2019re on. It\u2019s a very brightness-by-vibes thing. I\u2019ve only changed the brightness on my lights right out of the box, so it\u2019s annoying for about a minute per light, then not again. If you\u2019re planning on doing something else, this could be a major annoyance. The on/off/auto (auto = motion detect setting) button is a very small, poorly-marked slide lever. I took three different color permanent markers and colored over the word \u201con\u201d in green, \u201coff\u201d in black, and \u201cauto\u201d in blue for all of them. That solves the labeling issue very nicely. I just discovered a very strange thing that may prove to be a real and un-solvable issue: a charging bug.Tl;dr here is these lights will sometimes charge with some cords and sometimes won\u2019t. If the red light doesn\u2019t come on, even if you know the cord/setup works with other devices, it\u2019s not actually charging.The full story: I charged all six lights out of the box with my usb-c tablet charging cord. All six glowed red on the motion detection dome while charging, then lasted a long time. It\u2019s been over two weeks on the motion detect setting and I just had to recharge a light for the first time. (It gets noticeably dimmer when it needs charging, it doesn\u2019t just conk out on you.) I plugged it into the same usb-c cord I initially charged all the lights with and that I had just used to charge my tablet last night. Also the same charging brick, power strip, apartment and location within the apartment as the initial setup. No red light. I unplugged and replugged and still no light. I plugged my tablet into it and it started charging. I Replugged into the light again and again no red light. I thought maybe it only happened the first time for some reason or maybe the battery was just too low, so I left it there for over an hour. I checked it and the light was still very dim. It hadn\u2019t been charging. Took it inside and plugged it into the usb-c in the kitchen, red light immediately on. Brought that cord into the living room to switch with the first usb cord and the red light didn\u2019t go on. Checked the kitchen cord with the tablet and it works. Got one of the tiny usb cords out of the light box and that worked in both places immediately. No idea why these would charge correctly sometimes and not others, but be very aware of the red light.",

It's been going on and off religiously at least 4-5 times a day for 3 weeks and still hasn't required recharging.Has two short charging cords, extra magnetic mounting plates, screws and decent instructions. The light is bright and adjustable. The motion detector is sensitive enough to do the job but not annoying. And the light turns off in 30 seconds or so if unattended. Excellent value!",

                "reviewText": "I needed lights in my stereo cabinet to illuminate my albums. These were very easy to install, look good and do the job. The \"auto\" mode is excellent -- the motion sensor turns on the light when I open the cabinet door and then turns off in about 15 seconds after it's closed. I liked them so much I bought two more for other cabinets. I was concerned about recharging but that's no problem since they're magnetic. So once you mount the metal plates, the light is easily comes on and off. Tip - - The plates are already installed on the back and it appears they are adhered - they're not - - just pull them off for installation - - they're only magnetically placed there.",
