It\u2019s good quality material too and goes so nice with all of my new black accents I have in the kitchen! There\u2019s a cool little adjustable drain thingy that drains the water from the little tray into the sink in whichever direction you\u2019d like the water to flow and empty to. Very nice for chic and minimalist lifestyle. Thank you so much!",

                "reviewText": "I've been looking for a Kitchen sink caddy like this for a very long time. This is exactly what I was looking for. The caddy provides a water drain pipe can be pivoted to save space when you are not using it or can be extended outwards into the sink should water drainage be desired. The size is minimal so it fits perfectly on my Kitchen sink counter where space is very limited. It holds the scrubbers, sponge, a bottle of dish washing liquid, and hand soap just perfectly.The caddy is made of solid steel construction that is sand blasted with a coat of black paint, which blends nicely into the decor of the Kitchen and remains light weight. The water tray is easily removable should it requires cleaning and it comes with an optional silicone plug to prevent water from being drained from tray. A divider provides the proper separation between the sponge that I frequently use from the hand soap and dish washer liquid preventing the soap from the sponge from making a mess on the bottle and automatic soap dispenser.Overall this design is very well thought out. I would highly recommend this caddy.",

What really caught my attention to this specific organizer is that it has a tall section which will hold your brushes in an upright position. Having a drain spout which can be positioned in any positions allows you to place the organizer where you want it. 10/10",
