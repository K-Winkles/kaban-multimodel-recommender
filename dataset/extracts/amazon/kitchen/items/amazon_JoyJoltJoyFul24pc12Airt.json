The only down side is there are 9 (nine) lid and storage container sizes, so with the hinged keepers, you have a sizable storage situation .So with plastic microparticles sluffing off with those containers I'm reading about, these containers fill the bill pretty good.",

Especially for a family, a lot of meal leftovers wouldn't fit in one container.During Thanksgiving, my dad was eating leftovers out of one of the dishes and like them so much he asked me to order him some.",
