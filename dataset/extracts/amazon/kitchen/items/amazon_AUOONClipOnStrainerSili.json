                "reviewText": "I bought this on a whim and I love it. It takes up way less space than a strainer. Easier to clean. And easier to store. I thought the pasta would fall over the ledge but it hasn\u2019t. We eat pasta weekly and not one noodle has fallen out of the pot! Definitely recommend for people who hate washing dishes (strainers in specific), are pasta eaters, and/or are looking to save storage space.",

This was such a handy tool to have whenever I needed to strain something from a pot, like noodles, veggies, or small amounts of potatoes. The silicone means you can adjust to fit a variety of pots sizes, and it makes for a snug fit on the pot. No more trying to hold a pot lid askew to drain while steam rises in your face! Just clip, dump, and return to the stovetop. To clean, you unclip, and then rinse and wash. It can also go in the dishwasher. I loved mine so much I ordered one for our older daughter who was living more on her own at college. Way better than the old dump into a strainer in the sink routine.",

I think I am beginning to LOVE this funny little contraption!! It makes life easier when straining anything, even a big pot of noodles!!Just clip onto the side of your pot and you are all set to strain away with little effort - pun intended!Certainly easier to clean than a big strainer which always gets sticky with residue from pasta. This thing is easy to hand wash or toss into the dishwasher since it is small.You can't beat the price even if you are just giving it a try!!",

I bought the black one and it gets a white residue on it from the washer. Although it is easy enough to wipe off.I would def recommend this clip-on strainer! What a cheap solution to small kitchen woes :)",
