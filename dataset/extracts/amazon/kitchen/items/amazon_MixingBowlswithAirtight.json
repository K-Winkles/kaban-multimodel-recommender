            "AIRTIGHT LIDS & 3 GRATER ATTACHMENTS The airtight lids that come with this mixing bowl set make it easy to store ingredients and leftovers without worrying about spills or leaks. 3.5qt had a removable lid inside the main lid, for adding contents or pairing it with your blender without removing the entire lid to prevent splash. This bowl set comes with 3 different grater attachments (slicing/grating/shredding) just shred or slice right into the bowl! Perfect for preparing salads!",
            "NON-SLIP SILICONE BOTTOMS The rubber on the bottom of the mixing bowls is great for gripping and staying put which prevents sliding on the countertops when mixing and also protects the desk from high temperatures. There is no doubt that the silicone base is more wear-resistant, you do not need to worry about the wear of the stainless steel bowl bottom caused by long-term use",
            "NESTING BOWLS & DISHWASHER SAFE These kitchen serving bowls can be nested together and offer space-efficient storage in neat kitchen cupboards. The mirrored interior makes cleaning a breeze, This mixing bowl set also is dishwasher-safe, just put it in the dishwasher after use, and you will get a new bowl set. But pay attention that it's best to hand wash the lids, as the heat of the dishwasher can warp them",
            "6 SIZES BOWLS & EXTRA KITCHEN TOOLS SET The range of sizes from 7QT down to 1QT, makes this set incredibly versatile and suitable for a wide range of tasks. Each bowl comes with a QT label to make it easier to choose the right size, Bowl sizes fit on standard-size refrigerator shelves and cabinets. Comes with a brush, spatula, whisk, measuring spoons, and so on allowing you to save money on tools",
            "PREMIUM STAINLESS STEEL The stainless steel construction is durable for many years. This bowl set is constructed of a mirror-finish interior and matte-finish exterior ensuring dent resistance and rustproof. Food-grade stainless steel will not corrode or produce spots after long time use, please attention that after each cleaning, it is necessary to dry the inside with a cloth to prevent the corrosion of the remaining water on the bowl"

I love that each bowl comes with the lid and it\u2019s very easy to store salads or anything leftover. The only complaint I have is that after washing the water stains remain on the stainless steel material, even when I dry them with a cloth. Otherwise it\u2019s still a really really good purchase and I\u2019m still pretty happy with it.",

Everything was unused, in perfect condition, and packaged properly. My main reason for purchasing was the bowls/lids. The additional cooking tools are a useful extra, but I have not used the grating inserts as I already have tools I use for such needs.My main reason for posting a review is to point out that the lids should be hand-washed and not cleaned in a dishwasher. The lid on my large bowl warped as a result of it being cleaned in a dishwasher. I contacted customer service via Amazon and the person I communicated with went above and beyond in helping me with this issue.",

The non-slip bottoms work great to keep the bowls in place. I only have 2 complaints; one is that I wish the cheese grater would fit into the center of any bowl. It only works with the second largest bowl, and second, is the actual grater is a little flimsy. It is easily bent so you have to take care when washing/storing it. Other than that I really like them.",

They're actually so nice that you could probably serve from them as well. Love the quality and Packaging. Everything can be stored inside the largest bowl so it is not hard to store or take up lots of space.Update- Missing pieces \ud83e\udee0 I don't want to send it back. Hopefully the seller will send the 2 items I don't have.",

Au\u00dferdem nimmt das set nicht viel Platz in Anspruch.Der Versand hat jedoch total lange gedauert und zudem wurde unn\u00f6tig viel Plastik verwendet!!Der Verk\u00e4ufer wirbt mit einem Foto wo der Aufsatz die Gurken in Scheiben schneiden soll. Leider ist dies nicht m\u00f6glich, mit keinem der angekommenen Aufs\u00e4tze!!! Der Aufsatz der dies tun sollte hat eine geriffelte Seite statt zwei glatte. Unglaublich dass hier mit Sachen geworben werden, welche nicht eingehalten werden k\u00f6nnen. Schade, vorallem f\u00fcr den Preis!",
