                "reviewText": "At first I was shocked when these sponges came in the mail - that they only had one half the normal sponge on top, but after using one I realized I didn't need all that extra sponge at all or the excess soaping power of a large topped sponge. I got a super price break on this 24 count non scratch blue scrub sponge pack by AIDEA-Brite. I actually like them alot better and they are easier to use on my dishes and pots and pans than your normal non scratch sponges and are of better quality. They take up less room to store in storage cabinet and on the sink backsplash area when using one. Huge part, I saved tons of money over all the overpriced and expensive name brands and their overrated knockoffs. Not sure why but over the last few years but the name brand sponges & knockoffs don't last long because their non-scratch bottoms don't hold up. These AIDEA-Brite sponges already proving they last a lot longer and cost a whole lot less.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using the pictured sponge for cleaning dishes, pots and pans for just over 2 weeks now. It does not smell bad at all and is holding together well IMO. I expect I'll get another week out of it. As others have said, it is a little on the thin side, but I don't think it's too thin and it's very comfortable for me to use. Gets into the edges easier than some of the thicker sponges I've had. It does not scratch my non-stick. I would definitely purchase these again. They came quickly and the price was very reasonable!",
