                "reviewText": "These are perfect for helping me clear some cupboard space and to move stuff off my counter near my stove. I have an island stove with a metal vent hood over it, so I don't have any wall space to use for spices and such I use for cooking a lot and counter space is prime real estate. This attached perfectly on my vent hood and can place some of the cooking stuff I use but was keeping on the counter. I put three more on the fridge near my cupboard that was where I kept less commonly used spices, but it was always a hassle digging through the cupboard and I've dropped spices several times. These shelves on the fridge are great and cleared up my cupboard for things more suited to be stored there.",

I loaded so many spices onto them and they\u2019re wide enough to fit two rows of the square spice jars (think like the signature select spices from kroger/frys). Definitely worth it!",

The magnets are ultra strong, so I can actually put glasses and utensil in them and they will hold no problem. I am also using them for some of my flower pots as I do not have too much shelving space. I am not sure how to do it, I am writing the review now, but I will have some pictures to show a bit later during the weekend. Hopefully I can put them in so you can see. It is a fantastic storage and very contemporary looking.",
