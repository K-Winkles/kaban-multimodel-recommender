                "reviewText": "I like the product and it works well, but not perfect. It's made well and comfortable to use for home use. My only comment has to do with the upper press part. It is a little small for the lower bowl, and so although you do get most of the garlic going through the small holes, as it is meant to do, there is some that oozes up the sides around the presser. It's just a matter of then pushing it back down and putting it through again. Not a big deal, but leads to giving the product a 4. Overall a good product and it's getting lots of use. Much easier and less messy than doing garlic with a knife or grater. I would buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I ordered the bronze garlic press, and it is absolutely beautiful! I have tried it only a couple of times so far, but I like it.I used to own the OXO brand earlier, can't remember why I don't have it anymore. That one is definitely good too, but I like this one better. For one, I can squeeze the garlic through with far less pressure, so it's easier on my hands. I can't imagine how hard it would have been if I had had actual arthritis, ouch! The OXO one has a larger cup and can hold two or three cloves, it also let's you twist it backward to push out the leftovers. But I did not like how it left the outer portions of the cloves still in the cup, unable to push them through at all because of the flat pusher, wasting it. So after you peel away the dry outer shells that must go, the rest of the clove is edible and there's no need to remove more. So now that I'm tired of mincing garlic with a knife and wanted to order another press, I decided to go with one that allows you to use the whole clove. The little bumps on the Zulay cut the clove as it forces it through the holes.The downside is that it's a little harder to clean it since some leftovers stick to the little bumps, but a brush takes it right off. I also was able to rub it off with my fingers under running water. I wouldn't say it's easy to clean, but it isn't hard either.One positive with the OXO is also that you can put a completely unpeeled clove in the cup and give it a squeeze, then peel off the dry skins easily. The Zulay has the tags on it but I tried it anyway, and it worked pretty well. It cuts into the clove a bit so you can't do it too hard, or tiny fragments of the dry skin will get stuck in the tiny indentations you just made in the clove. But they're so tiny it won't matter at all & don't think. I'll experiment on how hard to squeeze to do the trick without much residue.In the reviews some people don't like how some of the garlic squeezes up and out of it, and I too foud that this does happen to a small degree. But I just push it back in and give another squeeze to press this out as well. You can even see it happening in their own video of their product, but I think the press is designed that way. Not that they're intentionally wanting garlic to squeeze out the top, but the little pusher has some room around it and I'm guessing it's necessary for it to have a small amount of wiggle room to move freely into the cup without hitting the sides. Probably they'd receive complaints if that happened, right? So there's a little bit of wiggle room to make it work smoothly, and as a result a small amount of garlic will sometimes squeeze out. To me that's no biggie when it works well otherwise, just push it back in again as you go. Easy peasy.",

Puree comes out, skin stays in the press.The clever prongs on the plate make sure that no garlic gets stuck in the press, roughly doubling the amount of puree that comes out if you're just doing one clove.I've tried it side by side with the (very good) industry-standard IKEA KONCIS press and this is much better in all ways.Other reviews mention a lack of durability. As new it seems solid as a rock, but I'll update this if it does break.",
