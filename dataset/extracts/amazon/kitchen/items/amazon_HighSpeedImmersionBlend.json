Very powerful, makes everything a very smooth consistency, and it takes two seconds to rinse it clean. I use a glass measuring cup to blend the smoothies which makes it easier to measure consistent amounts of ingredients and it has a handle so it won't slide around. I also mashed potatoes and a sweet potato in record time. Plus, it does not take up any counter space. Just drop it in the drawer. Fantastic!",

                "reviewText": "I have used the immersion blender several times since receiving it and have just noticed that the chopper has \"grooves\" on the inner vertical plastic at the same levels as the blades, which means that some of the recipes I've made may have had some plastic bits in it. The inner-vertical supports on the chopper bowl may not be a hard enough plastic for some food processing needs, so be sure to check the chopper bowl if you are using it with harder ingredients.The immersion blender itself works great and I have only seen 100w to 250w used so far out of the advertised 800w measuring on a kill-a-watt when using the stick blender and food processor to make hummus, sunflower butter, peanut butter and smoothies so far.This is my 1st experience with an immersion blender and I primarily got this item for the food processor. Its the perfect size for making small portions of nut butters and hummus. Overall, this product appears to be working fine with the exception of the food processor bowl showing noticeable chips on 3 of the 6 inner plastic supports at blade height within the first 7 days of use.It may just be a defective bowl and I will attempt to contact the seller for a replacement food processor attachment, making this immersion blender kit an excellent addition for meal and snack prep.",

Very easy set up and use and then clean afterwards. I went with the least expensive colour, black. But I think it\u2019s fun that you have a variety of colours to choose from.",
