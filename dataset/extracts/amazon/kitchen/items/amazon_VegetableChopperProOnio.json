                "reviewText": "I've had this tool for almost a year now and despite its downfalls, I love it and use it all the time as it really is a helpful and time-saving tool.Here's what I don't love:1. It, like all other choppers, is not all that easy to clean because it has so many holes. This is a down for any chopper like this. It is unavoidable. It does come with a fork-like cleaning/scraping/picking tool to help clean but I really only use it for the green top of the \"presser\". I wouldn't use it on the sharp cutting section for fear of breaking it or dulling it.2. The metal of the slicers are pretty fragile, I cannot use the small cube slicer as it is bent from the pressure of a quartered onion. It wouldn't go back into place when I tried to realign them.I still love this product though. I use it all the time.",

                "reviewText": "Tired of cutting the vegetables/fruit from scratch and wanted something that will save me some time. Was able to find this product and purchased to see if it will do the trick. Let me tell you it has been so far. First use and I felt like it saved me a lot of time and was very effective with cutting. It\u2019s very easy to assemble and easy to clean as well. It comes with so many options on ways to cut your produce. Also very easy to clean and put away. Great buy and I\u2019m glad I got something that will take away the task of chopping up vegetables at a longer time.",
