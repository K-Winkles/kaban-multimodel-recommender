These wipes are a game-changer for parents who want a natural and safe option for their little ones.The fact that these wipes are 99.9% water-based is a huge relief. I feel confident knowing that I'm not exposing my baby to any unnecessary chemicals or harsh ingredients. They are unscented and hypoallergenic, which is perfect for my baby's sensitive skin.Not only are these wipes gentle, but they are also incredibly effective. They do an excellent job of cleaning up messes without leaving any residue or causing irritation. I've used other brands in the past, and these are by far the best in terms of quality.The packaging is also convenient. The resealable sticker keeps the wipes fresh and moist, so I don't have to worry about them drying out. It's also easy to grab just one wipe at a time, which is a lifesaver in those moments when you need a quick clean-up.Overall, I highly recommend WaterWipes Plant-Based Original Baby Wipes to any parent looking for a safe, natural, and effective option for their baby's sensitive skin. These wipes have become a staple in our household, and I'll definitely be purchasing them again in the future!",

                "reviewText": "When I first delivered my son the hospital supplied us with Huggies Little Snugglers diapers and Pampers Sensitive Wipes . When he was very little the diapers were perfectly fine even though I had my heart set on pampers and pre-bought a bunch of preemies, newborns and size 1's. Long story short - after a couple of weeks the Huggies started to leak and we we had to switch brands.I was super glad we had stocked up on Pampers diapers, which haven't failed us thus far.HOWEVER, I do have to say that the Pampers wipes were not so great. The hospital gave us some wipes to take home with us and I bought about a million before little man was born.After just a few days out of the hospital, we noticed that his little bum was a bit red and irritated and I assumed he was somehow getting a diaper rash - which was perplexing because my fiance and are I always on top of his hygiene. We took him to the pediatrician who told us NO to Pampers, even the sensitive kind, and that she has had babies come into her office with chemical burns from wipes such as Pampers and Huggies.Her suggestion (or kind of demand) was that we buy giant cotton balls and use warm water. WELL, if you're a new parent or a parent in general and living in the real world - this is not as easy-peasy as it sounds. I was willing to do it because, well, doctors orders and I don't want my son to be harmed in any way. My fiance was less than convinced about this process but I was not about to let him use Pampers or Huggies or basically any other kind of chemical wipe. But I certainly I wasn't going to let him get out of diaper duty because it was too much of an inconvenience to use cotton balls and water.I did some investigating and was a little unsettled about the hidden ingredients in most baby wipe brands.According to the Environmental Working Group's analysis of ingredients commonly found in products such as cosmetics and baby wipes - up to 95% of baby wipes, specifically, may be contaminated with impurities that are, mind-boggingly- not regulated by the government. While the ingredients in the wipes aren't necessary toxic in themselves - chemical carcinogens, namely nitrosamines, can potentially form during the manufacturing process, during interaction with what the item is packaged in and after the product has been opened and stored. Essentially, some of the ingredients in baby wipes become contaminated for the aforementioned reasons and thus become entirely different ingredients that technically are not required to be disclosed to customers.I'm not a chemist and I know plenty of people who use and swear by Pampers and Huggie's wipes. Their babies and children are seemingly fine. It's doubtful every pack of baby wipes is going to cause cancer or contact dermatitis. And while not an alarmist - nonetheless, I was concerned about the information I came across. Also, I did not want to defy our son's doctor because she's totally awesome and an itty itty bit intimdiating. So that was it for me. I love you Pampers Swaddlers but your wipes gotta go and you can take most of your competitor brands with you.Except WaterWipes. When I found out these wipes were made of mostly water with a hint of grapefruit extract - I felt like this could be an excellent compromise between warm water and cotton balls and easily disposable and safe wipes IF WaperWipes lived up to its claims. I read up on the Amazon reviews and the majority of the reviews were positive and encouraging; thus I decided it was definitely worth trying. I must say that WaterWipes has lived up to its promises.Some of the reviewers claim these wipes are too dry. I kind of find this to be an issue with wipes in general. I've never used a brand of wipes that were super moist and stayed that way. It's just par for the course, IMO.I love these wipes. They are gentle enough to use anywhere. I even sometimes use them to remove my makeup in a pinch, even scrub off mascara. At first I thought the tiny bit of grapefruit extract might burn my eyes, but it did not. Also, there is no heavy fragrance to WaterWipes, which I can't stand in most baby products. The wipes don't dry out while being stored. They don't turn yellow or start to look burnt in the wipe warmers like some of the other brands I've used or seen used.I find it silly that some people complain about the price because it only has water and grapefruit extract. I'd rather pay more for simplicity that pay less for a bunch of chemicals that gave my baby red skin that was on the verge of becoming raw had our doctor not stopped us in time. I don't find the price to be outrageous - but even if it were - I'd probably still buy them for the sake of convenience. And, as I said, I like having them around for myself. I have a wipe warmer in every room and if I need to wash little man's face from spit up or his hands from drool or my hands from baby formula - no need to dash to the sink every time. I use these wipes instead, they are very multi-purposed.The one little complaint I have is that they don't seem to come apart easily. I'm NEVER ever able to pull them out individually from the wipe warmers so we just lift the whole thing up and grab what we need. My fiance, my friend who is frequently here and mostly anyone else is able to take one wipe at a time this way. But I can't help but manage to grab AT LEAST four every time, but that problem seems to be on my end. Also, before we got the WaterWipes, we seemed to have a problem with ANY brand of wipes easily dispensing from the warmer or their packages. This annoys me about wipes in general but nothing is really perfect. These wipes, however, come pretty darn close.I won't buy anything else and I won't recommend anything else.",
