I have sensitive skin and many wipes feel drying, irritating, or have an unpleasant residue where these feel comfortable to use and non-existant afterwards. And I can't say enough good things about the scent, which is pleasant but not heavy and doesn't hit that \"baby wipe\" smell.",

It\u2019s a ruly baffling to me that companies don\u2019t grasp that no one wants to smell like that or THINK about that regarding their most private area, ahem, but these ones smell great. Yes all adults should use these. Why? It\u2019s gross that you don\u2019t. If you got poo on you cheek, would you swipe at it with a dry tissue? I didn\u2019t think so. #convert You\u2019re welcome. xxx",

                "reviewText": "Our baby was allergic to EVERY SINGLE NATURAL WIPE except this one. It\u2019s expensive, no doubt, but it\u2019s worth it. The wipes are strong and soft, they work well even on tough diaper messes, and the scent is awesome (not floral, not artificial). Best of all, they work well for kiddos who have allergies or get rashes easily. There\u2019s never too little liquid, either. Nor have I had a wipe disintegrate on me. The best wipes around, hands down.",
