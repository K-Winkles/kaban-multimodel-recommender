I saw this listing and was so excited to be able to have our wipes delivered. However, the listing states 480 wipes total but we only recieved 120 wipes (12 packs of 10). That will only last us 10 days at most using only one wipe per change (which let's be honest some diaper changes are messy and require much more). I was very disappointed that I waited to receive these and it was less of a quantity that I needed. Now all the local stores are out of wipes and prices have jumped greatly for what is available online. Their product is good, but the description is not just misleading, but flat out wrong.",
