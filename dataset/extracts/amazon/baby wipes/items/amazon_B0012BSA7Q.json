It was nothing major, but irritating enough to feel some discomfort for a couple of hours, even after I washed my face. I wouldn't recommend for a baby's face since they can't talk and tell how they feel.They are thick full sized wipes. Perfect for cleaning off poop effectively. They measure about 8\" by 7\". The container is soft, but has a hard plastic snap shut lid to keep them moist. The container is not bulky. Easy to carry in a diaper bag.I decided to use them clean up my dog who doesn't like baths. They do a good job of cleaning the dirt off of him.",
