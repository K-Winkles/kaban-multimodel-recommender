                "reviewText": "I've tried out so many brands of wipes to figure out which will be best for my baby. These wipes are super thick so they don't tear. They are perfectly moist and don't get dry at any point in the pack. They also have a design on them, which is cute as well as it gives the wipes texture so it cleans better, grabbing onto the mess, in a way. The lid is a push-button top with a one-handed pull. It truly is one handed, as only one wipe comes out at a time which is super convenient.Comparing these with Huggies Simply Clean:Classic Clean seems to have a soapy residue that gets left on your skin. They also leave little fuzzies on your skin or whatever surface you're wiping. Pure Water does not feel soapy nor does it leave fuzz.Compared to Kirkland Signature Fragrance Free Wipes:Kirkland brand is a close second. They are very strong and thick, but Pure Water is a little thicker and again, the texture picks up messes better. Kirkland is cheaper but the quality is slightly lower. Kirkland wipes have a good one-handed pull, usually giving you one wipe at a time. The lid is flip-top instead of push button as with Pure Water.Compared to Amazon Mama Bear 99% Water Wipes:Amazon brand is just not good. Mama Bear wipes are thin, on the dry side, and they are smooth therefore they slide across the skin and don't clean up messes very well. These wipes are a lot cheaper than Pure Water wipes but the quality isn't good. You get what you pay for with them. These wipes fall short in all the places where Pure Water goes above and beyond.Compared with Pampers Sensitive Wipes:Pampers Sensitive wipes are good quality but one thing I can't stand is they come with the sticker top. It eventually loses its stickiness and the pack is just open, drying out the wipes. There's no such thing as a one-handed pull with these. As for the quality, these wipes also have a pattern with gives them a good gripping texture. They are moist when the pack is closed and they are a nice thickness but not as thick as Pure Water.Overall Huggies Pure Water wipes are the best and I'm willing to pay a little more for this quality.",

I bought ten other brands, and these are the thickest and softest of any wipe I have tried (except for the hospital grade Huggies wipes that aren\u2019t available for retail purchase). The 56 wipe pack of these wipes is taller than most 72 and 80 pack wipes because they are so thick. They don't have any fragrance and they don\u2019t have the strange chemical smell of many fragrance free wipes. I have repurchased 4 times already, these are great for my son.",

                "reviewText": "We received so many different types of wipes at our shower and I kept searching for the perfect ones. I wanted to be comfortable with the ingredients but as all parents know, there are other qualities you want in a good wipe. This checks all the boxes. The opening is unique and so convenient. Only requires one finger to open (push to open top). Much better than water wipes or other wipes with sticky top that collects hair, debris, and dries out. The wipe itself is also thick and big and after using water wipes for the last couple of weeks, this is like a dream come true. Wish we'd known about these sooner. I love them.",
