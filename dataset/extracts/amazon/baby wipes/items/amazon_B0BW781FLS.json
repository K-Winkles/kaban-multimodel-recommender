Upon first of the wipes I noticed that it was almost akin to paper towels and it\u2019s not to say it\u2019s a bad thing. For the messed like poop from the baby, I\u2019d have to say that it did the job and there were a few times, maybe due to user error, that they almost ripped whereas most of the wipes I buy from other brands or big box stores, they hardly ripped. As far as wetness they were the perfect wetness and not too dry or wet. Overall it\u2019s a good product if I was mainly buying all sustainability products but I\u2019d recommend others based on cost",

My husband worked at a paper mill when he was young and they have to use a ton of chemicals to make paper. What I don\u2019t understand there is not one single company in the USA making unbleached tissue paper and toilet paper.

The absorption capability and softness are the prime features which makes skin non-irritable. These are free from harsh chemicals and great for daily use. They effectively clean and absorb moisture, leaving the skin feeling fresh and dry.The packaging is thoughtfully designed for busy parents on the go. The flip-top lid ensures that the wipes stay moist and are easily accessible. These wipes are not just limited to diaper changes. We've found them to be incredibly useful for wiping little hands and faces, cleaning toys, and even quick spills.Overall for the price and quality of the wipes, these are recommended to try and worthy.",

                "reviewText": "I really like these wipes. I find there a really great substitute for baby wipes, but you have to wet them yourself. Because of that they\u2019re great to put into my diaper bag and just keep there as a back up, because if I put wet wipes in the diaper bag they\u2019ll sit and grow with bacteria because of the moisture, but that doesn\u2019t happen with these because they\u2019re not wet!I will say that I do not like using them on my face. They are soft and thats fine, but they smell like sulfur. I don\u2019t know why, but it\u2019s not pleasant and it gets stuck in my nose and I don\u2019t like it. They also have a very strange texture when wet. It\u2019s not a bad texture, but it is something that I\u2019ve had to get used to.I love to wipe up spills and clean messes with these and clean counters. They are super durable like paper towels, except more so. So I can really scrub and they stay intact.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Admittedly, there are things I loved about this bamboo dry wipes. One is that it is a multipurpose wipes. I use it for house cleaning like dusting surfaces or wiping spills on table. To reuse it, I hand wash them, let it dry & use again for 3-4 times. Also, I use it for skin cleaning such as wiping my LO face & body. Another great thing about it is that it is suitable for sensitive skin. It doesn\u2019t irritate my face like other wipes & tissues do. I have been using this almost everyday.Despite these wipes are reusable for a couple of times, they can\u2019t still be cost effective. These wipes are ultimately disposable, which means that I will need to purchase more once they are used up, unlike washable reusable wipes. Additionally, I am hesitant to reuse them for cleaning the skin due to potential contamination and hygiene concerns.Overall, I would recommend these bamboo wipes due to absorbency, softness & versatility. However, if you are seeking a product that can be reused multiple times, these wipes may not be the most suitable choice. Thank you for taking time to read my unbiased review. I hope you\u2019ll hit \ud83d\udc4d if you find it helpful.",
