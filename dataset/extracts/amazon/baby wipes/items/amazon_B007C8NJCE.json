All of Huggies baby wipes are made with at least 70% plant-based fibers by weight to ensure a gentle clean that\u2019s free of harsh chemicals. Are these wipes easy to grab one-handed?

They are smaller than what we\u2019re used to so I have to use more wipes with #2s. We also have a wipe warmer and have to reach in each time to grab them bc they separate too easily from one another instead of bringing the next one up. I think bc they aren\u2019t as moist. They are however very durable and thick. Also, since they separate easier they do come out easier from the package it comes in. They also are pretty gentle on his bum.",
