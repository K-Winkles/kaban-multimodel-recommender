They are SO soft and get the job done. My son is breastfed and only 4 weeks old so we have A LOT of diaper changes; I keep these wet and in a warmer and they seem much more gentle on his sensitive skin. Even starting out wet they soak up any mid change \u201caccidents\u201d (you know what happens when you change a baby boy!). I have also used them dry with a squeeze bottle and they absorb all excess water well. I highly recommend these wipes!",

No problems with the seams coming undone like other brands (that were the same price or more). LOVE THESE and I've been using daily and washing tons for over a month with no problems.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered one pack of these when my baby was born a year and a half ago. We have used them every day and washed in the machine and put them in the dryer. Not one of them has unraveled. But just like with other cotton products like his diapers you have to wash them and dry them three to five times before use because cotton has a natural anti water absorption coating on it and these are unbleached organic cotton. After a few washes they are amazingly absorbent and I use a squirt bottle that has a few drops of lavender in it to wet them that's on our changing table. The Disposable wipees are made of plastic and are terrible for the environment to be using them once and then throwing them away. These are great because there is zero waste and we throw them in the washing machine and they come out really clean. They would also dry very quickly if you were hanging laundry to dry. We absolutely love this zero waste option for baby wipes. We just ordered another pack for him to take to preschool for hand wipes instead of sending him with those awful chemical wipes they ask you to take with them. We'll just include them in a wet dry bag and one section will be for clean wipes and one section will be for used wet wipes. I highly recommend these to any one with a infant we use them from day one and we will continue to use these and will relive their life as rags once we're done using them for the baby.",

                "reviewText": "These wipes are pretty good. Love that they're organic, and they are very soft. We dampen them with water, use them, and throw them in the wet bag for washing. The edging does tend to run / lots of threads after just a few washings, but the wipe itself seems to be holding up fine. We have an old-fashioned top loader, not sure whether they would hold up better in an HE machine.",
