But for really big messes (poop) I can't rely on the wipes. So I have to give him a bath. I never flush wipes of any kind down the toilet. Not good for the drain. I also leave a pack in the bathroom in case you need something more gentle than toilet paper. These wipes are not really juicy which means no drying time needed. I keep my package in a ziploc bag to prevent the wipes from drying out. I would buy these again.",

However, the wipes are annoying to get out and sometimes stacks of wipes come out when I am only trying to grab 1. They stick too tightly to each other. I bought the pack of 3 at first and those were kind of dry but the larger 12 pack was perfect amount of moisture.",

You can't pull out 1 wipe without a clump of 6 coming out of the tiny dispenser!!! You have to pull, pull, pull and by that time, your baby wipe is a foot long!! Then, you have to try to shove that wad back into the tiny opening and that flimsy closure falls off of the package!! Plus, there's a very odd scent.....and they're too thin...",

                "reviewText": "These are our new go to wipe. We had started using Honest which are great but the price tag isn\u2019t. We switched around and found that most \u201csensitive\u201d wipes made our baby\u2019s butt break out in rash. Water wipes agreed with his skin the best. However they don\u2019t continuously feed, which drove me nuts especially when trying to use a wipe warmer in winter. After a long search I found Pura and tried a single pack out before going for the whole box. They\u2019re very comparable to water wipes and are made of the same material (which is what I think was the biggest issue for my baby rather than the ingredients of the wipe solution itself) - but Pura has a continuous feed so they can work in a wipe warmer! They\u2019re maybe a little drier than other wipes but I simply add water to the pack every so often and they\u2019ve been great. I appreciate that there EWG verified and have a reasonable price tag. The picture is of Pura, water wipes, and Honest for a helpful visual comparison of size and texture (Pura in center). My only complaint is that the packaging leaves some to be desired but you can always use a wipe warmer or dispenser to solve that issue.",
