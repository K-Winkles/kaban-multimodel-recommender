I use them on my two year old\u2019s dried sleep around his eyes, his nose and have even used them as a regular wipe in a pinch at the park. He has very sensitive skin and these have never bothered him. TMI in a normal conversation but for this product review it feels necessary to note that it takes hard/crusty boogers off very easily. Price is waaay better than boogie wipes and since they are so cheap I use them much more often than I did Boogie Wipes. Daily staple, keep packs in car, diaper bag and at home. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The boogie wipes brand are completely out of stock for awhile. We\u2019ve tried frida baby and that is awfully. I\u2019ve looked around. There\u2019s not much reviews on this one but quite positive so I decided to give this a try. I have no issues unfolding it\u2026just take one out and kinda swing downward and ta-da;) Quality is good. Everything seems to be good so far. Most importantly it\u2019s unscented!!!There\u2019s a lightning deal + 20% off coupon going on so I reorder more. Great deal but otherwise price wise it is still lower than other brands. I would recommend if you too are shopping around for nose wipes.",
