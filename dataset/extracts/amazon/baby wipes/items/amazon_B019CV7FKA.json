                "reviewText": "My son has had an issue with his tear duct draining since he was born. His pediatrician kept saying it should clear up, but at 10 months old, I was beginning to fear he might need a surgical procedure because absolutely nothing was helping. I was skeptical about this product but I was desperate. I wiped his affected eye multiple times a day, and lo and behold, by day 5 his eye had cleared up!",

                "reviewText": "My 3 month old son has a blocked tear duct that has not cleared up as of yet. I keep these wipes in my purse and diaper bag, they are great for on the go when his eye needs a quick wipe. They are gentle and do not irritate his eye further. We will be giving some to daycare so that they can use them throughout the day as well.",
