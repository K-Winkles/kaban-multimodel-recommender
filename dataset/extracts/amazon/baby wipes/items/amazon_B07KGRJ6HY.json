                "reviewText": "These wipes are more wet than any other brand we have tried, which makes for easy clean up regardless of the type of mess.. They are gentle on infant skin. Minimal scent makes them more tolerable for face wiping! Only complaint is how they are layered in their container--they often get stuck to each other an pull out more wipes than needed.",
