                "reviewText": "Our 3yo and even our 15 month old absolutely love these! Even if they are fussy or crabby after they are done eating, or before bedtime, when they see me pull these out, insant improvement in their attitude! Lol.These wipes come in an individual foil type packet, you tear open the top, and the wipe itself is about the size and shape of a credit card, perhaps slightly larger than a credit card. They are moist with the xylitol solution, and you simply wipe the teeth, gums, and inside of the cheeks. And since they are wrapped in their single packets, they travel great, so you can use them everywhere & on the go!Our periodontist (served as president of the Michigan Academy of Pediatrics Dentistry) highly recommended these for the xylitol to help against the battle of the bacteria that causes tooth decay! I tried them myself and they do indeed have a grape flavor, it's sweet almost like \"candy sweet\" from the xylitol, but the periodontist swears they are effective. I've only been using them for a couple of months now for my little guys, so I won't know the extent of their effectiveness until they get their teeth checked out again. But in the meantime, they sure do taste great, and help with crabbiness too! Lol I will be sure to give an update after their next check up!UPDATE ~ I used these, along w/ xylitol suckers & our check up had zero cavities! 5 stars for sure!",

                "reviewText": "I use these for my infant as they constantly demand a drink, usually milk which in fact is not great for teeth.These have Xylitol which is a sugar alcohol, the same reason I myself chew orbit.In other products this chemical stimulates the taste receptors for sweetness, has no fructose and and has negligible effects on blood sugar and insulin - info for diabetics - worth reading into for his group.SO! Studies have determined that xylitol boosts dental health and helps prevent tooth decay!One of the leading risk factors for tooth decay is an oral bacteria called Streptococcus mutans. This is the bacteria most responsible for plaque. excess plaque encourages your immune system to attack the bacteria in it. This can lead to inflammatory gum diseases like gingivitis.Bacteria in your mouth feed on glucose from food, but they can not use xylitol. As you replace sugar with xylitol this reduces the food available to them,BUT WAIT THERE IS MOREthe bacteria can't use it BUT they still ingest it. After absorbing xylitol, they are unable to take up sugar, basically like if you were to sew your mouth shut - so the bacteria then dies as it is unable to eat!Thus there are the benefits for you- certain bad bacteria in your mouth will die! thus saving your teeth!",
