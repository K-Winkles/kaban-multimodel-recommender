                "reviewText": "These are a good value for the price and quality! I was originally using the Honest company dry wipes and while I love the Honest wipes because they are textured making poop cleanup a tad easier- they are very expensive for the amount you get- especially because we go through wipes like crazy since our little one is sensitive to regular baby wipes. I also tried the Winner brand dry wipes but those were way too thin! The Whoopsie dry wipes are larger in size than the honest dry wipes and they are much thicker than the winner wipes. Clean up is easy, we use a water spray bottle and spray the Whoopsie dry wipes right before cleaning the baby (with plain water), this routine has worked wonders as the regular baby wipes were giving our baby severe diaper rash! We also use the whoopsie dry wipes to dry the baby\u2019s bottom after clean up and before applying diaper rash cream, so they are good both dry and wet. I only wish they came textured similar to the honest company dry wipes and that would make them perfect! However, with that said, for the 6 pack of wipes and 100 wipes per package, these are a much more affordable and practical brand for long term use, also they are decent quality so I would still recommend these over the other two brands I mentioned. Highly recommend!",

My little one is prone to diaper rash and I find these are a life saver - I use a wet wipe to clean up the mess and use these dry wipes to dry him off before a little diaper cream and a clean diaper. No more diaper rash! These are also great as a substitute for paper towels when cleaning up my messy little eater after meals. Much softer than paper towels.",

                "reviewText": "Wonderful wipe for rubbing alcohol and runny noses and things that tissues are too light weight for. I\u2019m using mine to clean with white vinegar for delicate glassware.Update: I\u2019ve been using these for most of 2020 with rubbing alcohol for covid-19 prevention on surfaces and my hands, and to remove makeup with baby oil, and to apply lotion or body wash. They are really useful if you cut a slit lengthwise across the top of the plastic wrapper you create a dispenser like a tissue box. I bought a plastic snap top travel squirt bottle that was bpa-free and cosmetics rated and filled it with isopropyl rubbing alcohol and throw them in my pocketbook to squirt on the wipe to clean shopping carts and my hands when I go grocery shopping. They are really sturdy and wonderfully soft. Probably the best purchases I ever made on Amazon and certainly the most useful. I used to be a nanny and these would work great for snotty noses, drool and spit up, and diaper changes with water for cleaning and also for applying rash ointment.",

Happy to say since we have bought these, he has never experienced any more open sores, no diaper rashes, and so very soft and easy on his sensitives skin! We have been using them since AprilOnly sad part is the price. I feel like 20$ for a 2 pk is a smidge high. BUT if you keep an eye out for the 6pk it goes on sale often =) QUALITY & COMFT 5 STARS",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased these dry wipes and have found them to be a convenient and versatile addition to my daily routine. While they have their minor drawbacks, overall, I am quite pleased with the product and would highly recommend it.First and foremost, the dry wipes are incredibly versatile. They can be used for a variety of purposes, such as removing makeup, applying toner, or simply refreshing the face throughout the day. The lint-free material is gentle on the skin and does not cause any irritation, making it suitable for all skin types.The packaging is well-designed, with each wipe individually sealed for hygienic use. This makes them perfect for travel or on-the-go situations. The compact size easily fits into a purse or toiletry bag, ensuring that I always have them handy whenever I need a quick refresh.What I appreciate most about these dry wipes is their absorbency. They effectively soak up excess oil and impurities, leaving my skin feeling clean and refreshed. The wipes have a soft texture that feels gentle on the face, providing a pleasant and comfortable experience.However, there are a few minor drawbacks to consider. The wipes can be a bit smaller in size compared to some other options on the market. While this is not a major issue, it would be beneficial if they were slightly larger for more efficient use.Additionally, I found that the wipes tend to be a little thinner than I expected. While they still get the job done, a slightly thicker material would provide a more luxurious and durable feel. However, considering the price point, this is a minor concern.In conclusion, these dry wipes offer convenience, versatility, and effectiveness in a compact package. They are gentle on the skin, absorbent, and perfect for various skincare needs. Despite their smaller size and thinness, they are still a reliable choice for daily use. If you're looking for a practical and multi-purpose dry wipe option, these wipes are definitely worth considering.",
