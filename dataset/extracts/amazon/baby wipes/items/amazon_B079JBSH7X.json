                "reviewText": "Many years ago, I stumbled on these wipes as a part of my daily hygiene regimen on trail and on the water where showers are few and far between. Upon running out, I grabbed any old brand, and regretted not having these instead. No big deal, I\u2019ll pick up more when I exhaust my supply of second-rate wipes.Problem was, Simple Truth\u2019s marketing department fails utterly to distinguish their wipes from the inferior wipes which act like moistened paper. I was left to sample all of the high-end, unscented competitors, and my propensity toward economy had me buying multipack packages to get the best deal. What an exercise in frustration! Part of the reason I\u2019m leaving this review is so I can refer to it later if I ever again forget which brand to buy.Simple Truth wipes are, hands down, the best wipes around, and it all comes down to the material (see pic). Simple Truth wipes don\u2019t fall apart. They don\u2019t disintegrate in use to leave bits of paper all over my body. A good stubble on my face will literally tear up an inferior moistened paper wipe before I can use it anywhere else. Simple Truth wipes are more like cloth than paper, and I can perform a thorough once-over with a single one rather than two or three of the moistened paper variety. They don\u2019t disintegrate in use. Of course, these are also superior to their competition and standard toilet paper when it comes to efficient post-deucing clean-up.For what it\u2019s worth, I employ wipes in my daily hygiene regimen with a few drops of tea tree oil as an efficient means of disinfecting, except for my face. Tea tree oil shouldn\u2019t be used around one\u2019s eyes. This leaves me feeling and smelling clean all day, and I can regularly go a week between showers by daily wiping with a few drops of tea tree oil.I\u2019ve used \u201csport wipes\u201d which are just larger versions of regular wipes in considerably more expensive packages. They work fine, but they\u2019re simply more than necessary, and vastly more expensive.I use Simple Truth wipes everywhere on my body, and while they sting a little around my eyes, it\u2019s not as bothersome as getting soap in my eyes. They don\u2019t contribute to irritation elsewhere, and I feel the cloth-like material is able to clean more aggressively and effectively than the moistened paper variety. It goes without saying that regardless which wipes I use on trail or at sea, I always practice \u201cLeave No Trace\u201d principles, saving used wipes in a Ziploc or used freeze-dried meal bag for responsible disposal.The package is frustration-free. The flap (see pic) that contains the wipes in the package is thick and easy to manage, whereas the cheap competitors tend to use what feels like a piece of packaging tape which is initially difficult to open, and fails to seal shortly thereafter. The wipes separate easily into easily dispensed individual pieces, whereas the moistened paper versions have regularly tested my sailor\u2019s repertoire of curses.I can\u2019t speak to a baby\u2019s preference, because I\u2019ve no experience in that department, but they\u2019re absolutely the best for my use scenarios. I\u2019ve tried at least a dozen brands over the last couple of decades. There\u2019s simple nothing that compares to Simple Truth unscented baby wipes. Again, I use wipes on a daily basis, and my snobbery comes as a result of extensive personal experience.I bought these locally rather than on Amazon, and I\u2019ve not received any incentive to provide my review.",
