                "reviewText": "Wipes perforated, lid holds wipes in place for easy dispensing, extra liquid in the bottom to keep wipes moist for extended shelf life, what more can I ask. Definitely takes the extra step of getting a washcloth and putting soap and disinfectant on it out before beginning to clean. In other words, I can just whip it out and I\u2019m ready, which saves some time. Even the extra liquid comes in handy if I already ran out of the wipes themselves, I could put a couple of wash clothes in there so it doesn\u2019t go to waste. It can all be used! And even the smell of it is not too overpowering, the citrus smell of it makes it easier on my nose when I\u2019m cleaning.",
