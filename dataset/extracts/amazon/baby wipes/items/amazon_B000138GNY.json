                "reviewText": "UPDATE:We have now had these for 13 years!!! We bought a 12 pack in 2010 for $7.69, so the price is essentially unchanged, which is amazing. These lasted through regular use with two kids and after a hiatus for a few years we now use them as slobber rags for our assistance dog while we are out and about. I am so impressed with these!UPDATE:We have now used these wipes for about 2 of the last 3 years and are now on our second child with them. Through MANY washings, and a lot of use, they are still going strong. They are still soft, wipe well, and absorb great. Very happy with these wipes and would buy them again in a heart beat.Original review:We have been using these wipes for about a year now and don't have any complaints. They didn't shrink much upon first wash. The stitching is still strong after one year (I think we have only had one little string we have had to cut off). How you use the wipes, what the solution is, and how you clean and dry them WILL make a difference...it has nothing to do with the wipe, it's how you use them!Some things we have learned:- Putting the wipes in a container with your wipe solution and ringing them out just before use has been best for us - no absorption issues that way (we use hot water, a natural and scent/dye free liquid soap, and a little bit of oil - we prefer the oil vs. no oil because it seems to wipe smoother and easier)- Make sure you change your wipe solution out at least once a week or else you may run into a myriad of issues (mold, stiffness, etc.)- If you use baby oil or essential oils in your wipe solution, it may decrease absorption (same with cloth diapers)- If you line dry, the wipes do get \"crunchy\" or rough over time. We simply throw them in the dryer about once a month and they are nice and fluffy again (same goes for many cloth diapers)- When line drying, we give them a snap before hanging and that helps keep them straight/flat - we have never had an issue with folding or curlingThe wipes have worked great for travel for us as well. We put them in a wipe sized wet bag, rung out but not completely. Overall, the wipes have been great, and you can't beat the price. Most of these tips will be the same for any kind of cloth wipe. Don't hate on the wipe...learn proper usage and care!",

                "reviewText": "I tried a couple cloth wipes for cloth diapering, and these have been fantastic! We use a wipe warmer with water and baby wash to keep the wipes moist and warm. 2-3 days of these compact wipes fit in the warmer, which is fantastic. They are very soft and absorb such a lot that I could use them to clean up a mess if needed. Actually work best when moist, I think. We use a bidet for the first rinse, and have not had poop or pee staining, though the one downside is the red color has stained multiple other items that wash together - some red, some pink. The green also faded almost immediately to tan-yellow? But that doesn't matter hardly at all for our use! Very glad we tried these and would highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I am one of those people who has to try one of everything. I have the Thirsties 6 Pack Fab Wipes, Boy , the Imported Flannel Wipes 15 pack - All unbleached, and some two sided 100% cotton terry cloth wipes from Green Mountain Diapers. In my opinion they all have pros and cons it really just depends what you are looking for.The Thirsties are by far the softest, even after washing in our very hard water. After a couple months the colors have stayed well and they are the cutest. I like the two sides, the longer side is great for getting bulk and the other side is very soft and gets anything that's left behind. They are the largest but fit ok (about 12) in my Prince Lionhart warmer if they are folded in half. They do kind of stick together so pulling one out one handed is more difficult. If you want something really soft and cute, go with these.The flannel wipes are the most cost-effective option. They are thin and sometimes require a little bit more scrubbing to get sticky messes clean. They are pretty soft also. The best thing about this is you don't have to worry about running out of wipes in the middle of a diaper change. You can fit at least 30 wipes folded in half in a warmer. They are also wash cloth size so they cover your hand well and I like that I don't have to worry about using too many wipes. So if you're looking for cost effective and ease of use I would go with these.The 100% cotton wipes are nice because they clean messes really well and they are fit to go into a warmer, so I don't have to do any fancy acrobatics to unfold anything. These are the least soft of the 3 and even though they aren't folded they take up a lot of room in the warmer and don't fit perfectly (the edges come up). They say they are two sided but I don't like using the smooth side at all, it doesn't seem to have much use to me. They are also smaller and so I usually have to use more and I end up with stuff on my hands more often than with the others. If you like 100% cotton these would be an ok choice but honestly I would probably go with Under The Nile Organic Cotton Baby Wipes - 6 Pack which sound like they're softer.",

They\u2019ve been wonderful with how soft they are and doing great being run repeatedly through sanitary cycles on a washer. Love them!",
