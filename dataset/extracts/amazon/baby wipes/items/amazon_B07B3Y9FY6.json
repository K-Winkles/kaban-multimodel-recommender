                "reviewText": "I like these wipes a lot. I've experimented with them along with other brands to see which ones break up in water the best and I was pleased with these. The feel is nice and gentle. You do have to be careful when taking them out of the package because they can tear. I personally feel better flushing these than others but you will have to judge that for yourself. I like ordering them in the box from Amazon because in the stores they are stuck together with some type of sticky banding material that I I don't enjoy dealing with.",
