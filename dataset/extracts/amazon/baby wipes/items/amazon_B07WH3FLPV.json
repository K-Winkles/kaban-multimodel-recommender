                "reviewText": "I love this product. I have been using cleansing wipes of various brands. But none of them are as good as any wipes that I get that are meant for babies. These are particularly soft and sturdy. They smell good, they smell very good. Sorry but nowadays nothing is worth the money that we are charged so I can't speak on that. But I will buy these again.Updated rating 2/7/24So suddenly there was a caution sticker added a few months ago.Do Not Flush.I definitely don't need more wet trash to wrap up.Stopped buying these months ago.I would recommend them to folks who have the patience to discard wet wipes.",
