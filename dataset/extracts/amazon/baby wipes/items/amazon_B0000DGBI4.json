Then Whole Foods, and now I can't find them there either, or really anywhere. They are without a doubt our #1 preferred wipe. They're soft, but not the flimsy soft of other wipes. They're thicker and textured which are THE BEST for poops. They have enough water in them but not too much to drip down when you wipe your baby/toddler. IDK what it is lol but every other wipe I use after is just mediocre lol. My husband doesn't give his opinion on baby products very often, but even he agrees and prefers these! I hope they're just revamping the wipe and not discontinuing!",
