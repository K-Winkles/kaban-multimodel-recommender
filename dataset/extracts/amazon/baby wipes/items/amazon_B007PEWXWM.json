                "reviewText": "LOVE this! I'm ordering on subscribe and she bc we use so often w my 8 mo old. After every meal, whether home or out, we use em to clean him up. Smells wonderful, not harsh at all and we can scrub his entire face, mouth area, hands and body without him being affected. Dries well also. We had been getting boogie wipes and they leave a very sticky residue so we dropped boogie wipes and went back to these. Wonderful for his runny noise when sick as well. Will be giving these to other new moms as shower gifts!",

                "reviewText": "I was gifted this brand of wipes at my baby shower, and fell in love with them on day one of use.Smaller than baby wipes, and with a gentler solution, they are perfect for cleaning up little hands and faces during meal and snack times. My daughter loves them as we'll and will not hesitate to grab the yellow pack whenever a mess pops up (she's 21m old).I am thrilled to find this product available for bulk purchase. With one and one due days away, it is a load off my mind to know such a great product is available at an equally great price.",
