Safe and clean and should not cause you child any harm. In fact, will help by keeping them fresh and clean.Of course, it's no secret by now that baby wipes are good for the entire family. Especially for those times when getting to a sink might not be all that easy. I like to keep a pack in my beach bag. Great for cleaning up before and after a snack or just to wipe down a bit when I'm feeling all hot and clammy. Also good to keep with you while at work when you can't always keep running to the restroom to wash your hands. I'm not quite OCD about handwashing, but I do like to keep them clean more than my normal bathroom runs might allow. Especially if you are doing a job that has you wanting to clean up a bit more than usual. Great to keep in the car too for those unexpected needs.They smell fresh and barely have any scent at all. Honestly can't speak to them containing probiotics. Sounds good and I've had them do wonders when in my foods and other skincare products, but I can't really tell anything one way or the other as of yet regarding these. Seems fine so far.",

                "reviewText": "We are a wipe family. I wish we weren't because they really are terrible for the environment, but here we are. These wipes make me feel a little better because they are biodegradable and plant based. Our usual wipe, Kirkland Brand, is decidedly not either of those things.These wipes come in those extremely aggravating packets that are neither useful or helpful to any parent or person who has ever used a wipe. I have no idea who came up with this packaging, but the first person who designs a better package will be a trillionaire.These wipes are the same size as my Kirkland wipes (read: larger than a normal wipe) and therefore do not fit in most standard size wipe bins. When I have smaller packets like this, I usually just open them up and keep them in a reusable zip top container. The wipes do not easily pull one at a time and I found I either got ten wipes in a bundle or I had trouble getting one wipe. It was a feast or famine situation.The wipes themselves are tough. I took one wipe and pulled and could not tear it apart. This is the test I use and this wipe passed. I also wiped down my bathroom counter using some Odoban cleaner and a wipe and I did not find a bunch of fuzz left behind (this is not normal for me, this was just a test - usually I use a washable bathroom cloth).Also, if you are looking for a truly scent free wipe, these are not it. These have a sort of mild cucumber scent. It is not offensive and I have incredibly sensitive skin and was not bothered by it, but there IS a smell.",

They are a decent size and don't have a scent, so I think a good use for them would be to remove them from their packaging and place in a ziplock bag with diluted bleach water for a DIY disinfectant wipe.",

                "reviewText": "The thing I like most about these wipes, compared to the others I am used to purchasing in store, is the fact that these are not made with harsh chemicals. In fact, these actually contains probiotics, which are healthy for the baby.The question is, do the probiotics these wipes contain actually help or benefit baby, only being used externally? I don't know. I'm no doctor. I do have to say that I do have more of a peace of mind about these, compared to other wipes though. As far as size and consistency of texture are concerned, I would say these are pretty comparable to most of the other brands I am used to using. They are a little larger but are not extremely noticeable. These have a light scent to them but are not as strongly scented as most of the other ones I am used to using.All in all, I think these are good. They are durable and hold up well. I haven't had any issue of them ripping.",
