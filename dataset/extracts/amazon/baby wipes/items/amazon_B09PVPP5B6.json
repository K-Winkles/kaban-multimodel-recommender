I appreciate that they're made with naturally derived ingredients, alcohol free, chlorine free (free of parabens, phthalates, sulfates, dyes etc.) and vegan, making me feel confident using this product. They feel good on the skin without drying it out and are non-irritating. These would be great to have for travel or my gym bag. Overall, it's a decent product.

                "reviewText": "There are several things I like about these wipes... but also a few areas where they fall short.PROSWipes are thicker than most brands, so they don't fall apart or tear.There is plenty of moisture, so the wet wipes are indeed wet wipes... and that makes cleaning easier and faster.CONSI am not a fan of stronger smells, like strong perfume or incense. That being said, I don't care for the smell of these wipes. Cucumber is not what I smell, but something much more floral and dated. It reminds me of the decorative soap that my grandma had in her bathroom. It's just not my thing, and several reviewers say they like the smell. So it comes down to personal preference. It's not a \"bad\" smell, it's just too old-rose petal-grandma smelling for my taste. I'm already nauseous from the smell, after wiping my hands with a wipe. Conversely, my wife thinks they smell great!The main problem with these wipes is the dispenser design. After you thread the first wipe through the dispenser gripper (shaped like an X), the first sheet will rip off at the serrated end. However, when the first sheet is ripped off, the next sheet is not held by the X and falls back into the container. It's not that big of a deal, but I do find it annoying to have to fish out the next wipe with your fingers each (almost) time.I'm not sure what it is, but there first 2 wipes had what looked like dried glue on them. I'm guessing that this is the glue that is used to adhere the sealed top.",

                "reviewText": "Decent little container of wipes. They're adequately moistened, but I feel like they could use a bit more and may dry out faster than other wipes due to this. The towelettes are a bit flimsy and seem to tear even at the non-perforated points with some tugging.The container itself has a durable foil seal that was a bit difficult to remove; I was unable to puncture it. The the lid is a nice convex shape, so theres a bit of room for the bunch of wipes exiting at the top.I got the fragrance free kind, and they do still have a bit of a scent, but just the generic clean smell; not at all harsh or chemically. Doesn't seem to leave much residue behind either. They feel cleansing and don't dry my skin out.",

                "reviewText": "\"Fragrance Free\" means that it has no added fragrance, but a scent can still be noted--more than one would anticipate. Probably because it doesnt contain \"masking\" ingredients. This has a fresh, clean, pleasant scent. I find that the wipes are plenty damp. More wet than a lot of body wipes, or wet wipes for toilet use. I think they are a good size and strength for doing a quick wipe down of the body as a means to freshen up anytime (especially post workout). I like using them as a \"bird bath\". I just take 1-2 and do a quick wipe down all over. The wipes hold up very well. No irritation.I had no trouble peeling off the protective seal. The lid is secure and snaps tight. The internal clip holds a wipe securely, and I find that it helps the wipe to break away from the next one with ease. I seriously just havent had any issues with this at all in any way. I imagine I will use these up way before there is any concern of them drying out.I dont rate on price (we all have different budgets, needs, values, we can see the price before purchase, prices fluctuate, and more recently prices of things across the board have gone up so I am not going to say what it worth it and what isnt...you decide that.). That being said.. 30 wipes for $10? A little much for me. Thankfully they are plenty wet, and I could get a good wipe down with these. Also, appears to be a healthy products, so if you use stuff like this a lot, it can be good to avoid or reduce some ingredients.",

It really is something that you can use for bathing. It has a really nice fresh cucumbery smell. It does feel soft and I didn\u2019t find that irritated my skin or anyone else in the family skin. These wipes are thick so you cannot flush them down the toilet. It does not say that the wipes are biodegradable either. It only says that you can recycle the plastic carton it comes in. It\u2019s some thing that I would like to keep in the car however I\u2019m afraid with the heat of a closed up car it will definitely dry these wipes out quickly.",
