All the positives out weigh that tiny issue. The packaging is good, they are staying wet and coming out one at a time with no issues. They are moist, but not dripping, which is good. I have had no issues with them being to thin or tearing. They are easy to throw in a bag or just in the drawer next to the toilet. These will be great for camping and traveling also. I will be purchasing these often.",
