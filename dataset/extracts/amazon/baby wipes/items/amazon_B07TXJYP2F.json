My kids have sensitive skin and they haven't had any rashes from them though which is what matters.",

Additionally they are the prefect amount of wet, not too wet like the economy brands and not to dry. They are just right. The cloth is soft but not as large as the mainstream brands and also not as thick. I find it a reasonable compromise for being environmentally responsible. The only con to these wipes is that because they are thin, they stick to the next wipe when pulling them out and sometimes it can be hard to separate them with only one hand. Otherwise, these are the best wipes I\u2019ve found so far. I give a pack to every expecting mother I know with their baby gift.",

Another complaint I have is that they are hard to get out. I wish they would come out with a better design for pulling them and not ending up pulling out a quarter of the bag. Considering how expensive they are and also how you end up going through a ton due to the inability to pull out one at a time I will probably not buy these again. I did like the product though and if you want a decomposable and soft wipe I would recommend these.",
