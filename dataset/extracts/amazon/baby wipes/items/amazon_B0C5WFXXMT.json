This product has great value, has the same softness, is slightly thicker, has more wipes per pack, and is overall just as good as the brand at a fraction of the cost. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for Sensitive Wipes who want to save a little extra money on other important purchases like Formula or baby food.",

They are on the stretchier side, which isn't a bad thing.The scent is throwing me off a bit. It will definitely fight any unsavory scents that you're cleaning up, and to that end, it is very effective. However, the scent itself is reminiscent of the perfume that is used by an elder generation, perhaps a little more on the tropical side. I've seen a lot of wipes get the smell right (fresh, clean, and doesn't stick around for too long), and this doesn't quite meet that standard - it will smell like you just hugged your grandma for a couple of hours after use.",

Wiping my babies bottom wasn't a pleasant experience but that wasn't because of these wipes. The experience of wiping just isn't pleasant. The wipes did their job - they just have a very strong scent which I do not necessarily enjoy since it spreads right when you take it out of the bag. It's quite overwhelming and though it's a very familiar baby powder scent, it isn't something I want to be breathing in or spreading around what I use it on. Besides the strong smell, they are great wipes and I know I will be completing the pack in no time.",

                "reviewText": "I noted a strong \"snap\" of the lid as this is a pet-peeve of mine for any products like these. This is lid gives a good \"snap\" to prevent the wipes from drying out. That said, the wipes are strong and hold up well. I think the scent - though I like it - might be annoying when there's a \"big\" mess. The combination might be unpleasant for some...but then, a \"big\" mess is unpleasant to begin with!",

                "reviewText": "The first thing I noticed about these wipes was the smell. It has that class old school baby wipe smell. It was off putting at first but now it doesn't bother me since I'm used to it and expect it. The wipes itself work fine, they remind me of the Rico brand from Costco, except these have a smell to them. Would I pay $6 for these? Never. Maybe $2, they're just okay, not as good as Huggies or Pampers, but equivalent to maybe Kirkland wipes.",
