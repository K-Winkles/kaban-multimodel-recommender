I had another wipe that was just normal saline (not wanting to name names, but it was a major name brand) and the top kept coming loose and falling off. these come in a really sturdy flip top that can take a beating and still keep the wipes fresh. I hope they never change that. I also love the Boogie Butt Spray, such an awesome, easy solution, but I'll save that for a future review! :)",

                "reviewText": "My family couldn't live without Boogie Wipes! When my 3 year old gets sick, his nose runs a LOT. And wiping his nose with tissues leaves his nose raw! Wiping with these leaves his nose feeling better than before it was wiped and I swear that somehow the saline in these HELPS the mucus get released from his nose quicker, too. Love love love this product! It's great for adults, too!-As a wife and as a mom of 3 kids, I spend a lot of time shopping for deals on the best products out there for my family. It's important to me that if we're spending our hard earned money that we get a top notch product in return. I often rely on the reviews and opinions of others when contemplating purchasing a new product that I haven't tried before myself. Because of that, any products that I buy (whether on Amazon or from a 3rd party) I always make sure to leave a detailed review of the product to help others when selecting items to purchase, as well. My family tests these products fully before forming a solid opinion and writing a review. When I write a review, I keep in mind that those reading are also looking for honesty about the product and want an unbiased opinion to go by. If my review has been helpful to you, please give me a \"Yes\" vote on my review. Thank you!",

                "reviewText": "When I had my first child, I thought, \"OMG, how silly! New parents will fall for any gimmick to take their money!\" Now we have 2 kids, a 5-year-old and an infant. We have ALL caught EVERY. SINGLE. COLD. this winter! I'm seriously considering burning down the house and starting over in a cleanroom!Anyway, the pediatrician's office has a sample display of these, so I grabbed a couple when we were there for one of the innumerable visits we've had over the past year. Fast-forward to a day when both kids and I had noses so sore we could scarcely LOOK at TP or tissues without crying a little. So, I grabbed one of the sample packs and opened it, tentatively revealing the life-changing contents. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and placed the moist towelette to my nostrils. Then, I wiped. And I wiped again! And I blew and wiped! Oh, sweet relief! The cooling moisture made me want to strap one of these puppies to my face and leave it there all day!Only after I was sold on these for myself, I tried one on the baby. Her reflex to cry at having her nose wiped was quickly reversed to a look of peace and tranquility (well, as peaceful and tranquil as a sick baby can look...). The 5-year-old now asks for Boogie Wipes by name!I would pay TWICE this much for these! Don't listen to the haters who say, \"OMG, you fell for that?!?!? Who needs special wet wipes for their nose, anyway?\" This is worth every penny!",
