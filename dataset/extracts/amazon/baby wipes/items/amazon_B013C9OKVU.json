Though the price is a bit higher than many well known brands, the quality is unmatched. If you are on the fence - buy these wipes. The texture is very soft, the durability is incredible and it is not scented with unnatural fragrances.This is wipe that is large enough to cover a big mess and soft enough to be gentle on baby's delicate skin.Works great for wiping faces, hands, diaper clean ups, etc. Very versatile and durable.",

My kids are now nine and I still use them everyday. They're perfect for wiping down chocolate and spaghetti covered faces. I usually take a few and fold them up and put them in a plastic bag and keep them in my purse and they stay moist for when I need them when we are out and about. This is the first thing my daughter wants whenever she scrapes her knee because it's not water or anything that she deems that will hurt. She will let me put one of these on her boo boo to help clean it up. They are super soft and the whole family can get used out of them. They definitely don't hurt your skin. No allergic reactions here!",

Quite frankly if I did have a baby, I\u2019d be scared to use some of the other brands out there that are flimsy and smaller in size; I\u2019d only trust these for a blowout.They\u2019re really gentle on my hella sensitive skin. Super durable which is a pleasant surprise for being a compostable wipe! And they\u2019re a lot bigger than the average wipe.
