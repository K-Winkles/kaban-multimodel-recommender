                "reviewText": "Amazing wipes but the wipe dispensers are incredible!SO MUCH BETTER THAN HUGGIES OR PAMPERS WIPE DISPENSERS!There is a grippy rubber around the spot where you pull the wipes out, so it catches each wipe... you don\u2019t have the constant issue of having to open the box and get the wipes pulling as they should again. There is also a rubber grippy on the bottom of the box so it doesn\u2019t slide around the tile floor. The button is large and makes it easy for kids to open. When closing it is also simple because there is a rubber grip that holds the lid closed tight so you don\u2019t have to worry about wipes drying out.The boxes also came with cute, high quality groggy stickers so the kids can enjoy customizing their own box. They loved this and it encouraged my 2 year old to try to potty train!These containers are the absolute best.(I swear I wasn\u2019t asked to write a review and I\u2019m getting nothing in return for this)I was going on and on about how impressed I was with these wipe dispensers that my husband laughed and told me to write a review lol",

Defeats the point - you have dirty hands touching the lid trying to get what you need to get.... The pack of two containers - and both lids are not going to pop open.",

                "reviewText": "Great deal. I don\u2019t have small children, but I prefer these wipes over Cottenelle and other brands because I have very sensitive skin. This was a really good deal, as it comes with 2 containers and 4 packs of 50 wipes. My only dislike is that the opening is much larger than Cottonelle and other brands that aren\u2019t made for children. I can see where this would be helpful for children, but for me I have to tuck the wipe back into the plastic package to keep it from drying out, and even then if there\u2019s a bit of time between uses (I would say anything over an hour) the next wipe is at least somewhat dry.I also prefer to be able to completely remove the wipes from the plastic package and put them directly in the container, and I haven\u2019t tried doing this, but I feel that they would dry out quickly if I were to do this, because the only way I keep the \u201cnext\u201d wipe from drying is to tuck it in to the plastic package inside the container.Still, I\u2019ve used Cottonelle for years, and I definitely prefer these wipes for my own use over those or any other brand I\u2019ve tried.",

                "reviewText": "The wipes are great! However, if you don\u2019t cover the wipes back with the seal sticker, they dry out. So, when you put the wipes in the container, you have to open the whole container to open the package of wipes otherwise the wipes are dry. So the container is useless. I would recommend the wipes but skip the container.",

It's simple and both my 4 year old and 2 year old are able to open it easily and, most importantly, they can close it so the wipes don't dry out. I'm very happy with both the dispensers and the wipes themselves.",
