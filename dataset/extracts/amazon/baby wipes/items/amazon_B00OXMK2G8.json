I really think it\u2019s similar to Kirkland brand baby wipes because that was all I was using. And just to mention, Cuties baby wipes DOES NOT have a foul smell like Kirkland brand does. Cuties wipes has a light scent (not strong) and does not stink! It feels comfy, durable, and soft! I was using Kirkland brand baby wipes all the way because I loved the way it felt and how durable it was but the smell was not so great. I do not enjoy using pampers, Huggies, etc\u2026 just because I felt like it sucked period! Even tho Kirkland brand may have more wipes than Cuties in a box, I will And from now on, choose Cuties baby wipes over anything. Plus Cuties wipes has a lid cover that\u2019s easy to open. I\u2019m so glad I gave Cuties baby wipes a try because I met my needs for my baby\u2019s sake.",

                "reviewText": "My son has really sensitive skin. He can only use certain brands of diapers and wipes. I was buying the pampers pure aqua diapers. They\u2019re definitely on the pricey side, but they\u2019re the only kind he could use without getting a rash. I read the reviews on these, and decided to chance it. I have to say they are the closest wipes I have found that are equal in quality, softness, and durability to the pampers wipes. They are truly fragrance free. We have not had any issues with a rash at all. I also love the fact that they come with the lock closure on them. It keeps them fresh and moist and keeps him (2 yrs old) out of them. I would definitely recommend.",
