Highly recommend these pacifier wipes!",

                "reviewText": "I was hovering between 3 and 4 stars... I would give them 4 stars for their intended purpose - pacifier/toy wipes. However, I really bought them in an effort to save money compared to the Medela pump part wipes I have been using, and for that purpose I'd only give them 3 stars. They are much smaller than the Medela wipes, and far less moist. So they don't do as good a job wiping the parts between uses. Also, because they are so small, it's difficult to wipe the inside of the pump bottle - the Medela wipes are large so they can reach the bottom of the bottle. These Munchkin wipes really require at least 2 wipes to do the same job as 1 (or even half of one) of the Medela wipes.For wiping off pacifiers and toys that fell to the ground, I think they are the perfect size, and a good value for 36 wipes. I just don't use them for that purpose.",

I would just wipe the parts down, put them in a plastic bag in the fridge until my next pump, then wash when I got home.
