(unlike natural care fragrance free and simply clean.) they smell so so good - the scent is thick, soft, and fresh & sticks to the skin. they don\u2019t leave my babies skin feeling raw and dry like the sensitive natural care (fragrance free. the worst wipes ever) nor does the fabrics of the wipes come off as I wipe (like the natural care fragrance free, sensitive. my favorite before these were the natural care refreshing wipes with green tea and aloe or special delivery) it\u2019s just none of them were moisturizing enough. the refreshing wipes had a fresh scent and feel but they were still a tad bit drying. the special delivery wipes were great for when she was a newborn but now they just don\u2019t do the job. i can\u2019t get over these wipes. my baby has mild eczema and I was using the natural care sensitive scent free only because someone was thoughtful enough to buy her the three pack (I used them after running out of the refreshing wipes) but they were making her have dry patches on her privates. I bought them before when she was younger and hated them. they dried her face out and privates. I was like they have to have wipes suitable for black skin types and eczema prone skin and boom. These. My babies privates are so moisturized after using these & no longer dry. Ugh they just leave her skin so smooth. I also tested them on my skin first and it felt like i washed my hands with creamy lotion soap lol I will now be purchasing these only. reading reviews I seen a lot of people were let down by receiving wipes without the pretty black baby but luckily I got those. I think to prevent that from happening I\u2019ll just buy these wipes from the store from now on. Love them. Definitely try them out.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I live in a basement without a bathroom or sink to wash my hands when I need to for quick cleaning. To avoid running up and down the stairs to wash my hands every 10 minutes, I keep baby wipes on hand. I'm also a chronic pain patient and have to deal with wound care occasionally and these come in handy for simple cleaning (when it's not necessary to be antibacterial, just to clean things up). I got tired of the fresh scented ones that I had been using and stumbled across these. I love coconut and shea scented candles and body lotions so these are right up my alley! The scent is nice and light, it doesn't linger (though I like it so much that I wish it did stay around for a while!). These are definitely thicker than the other brand that I used. Very soft too. The only downside that I can think of is that maybe they're just a little smaller than what I'm used to because I keep trying to unfold it more even after I have it all unfolded! Lol (they're thicker so I keep thinking there's more to unfold!). Definitely buying these again! And I love the way it opens with just a touch! I could play with that all day! :)",

The thickness and texture were perfect.Now my son is 4 and we've been through a few batches of different types of Huggies.As of 2021, these are my FAVORITE Huggies wipes.I use them on myself after physical labor (we're renovating a house), after a workout when I have to run some errands, or even if I'm a little funky from just living in Houston.I have even used them on my face occasionally and they do not make me break out or give me dry skin.Of course little man is not quite there with all of the bathroom actions, so I also use these on his little rear end. We use them for his hands and face also and no redness / itchiness/ dryness.The fragrance is not \"perfume-y,\" it is a light coco butter scent and I really like it.Hopefully Huggies keeps these around and I can buy them forever.Update 12/13/22:I still purchase these 3 packs to have around the house and in our vehicles. Our son is almost 6 and uses them to wipe his face after messy / sticky foods or playing with slime or paint.",
