Not this product for I have bought and reordered the same product with the same result. I thought about this as to why this product is different. I came to at least one possible explanation. The round opening is larger than most opening could be the answer. It is also possible that the sheets are placed inside to prevent this annoying and costly way of selling wipes. No matter the reason I will continue to purchase until they change their packaging that the wipes eventually come out in bunches then I will go searching again.",

So I can honestly and confidently say I've tried all the brands.What I like most about these wipes:- they are folded/perforated enough that you get a single wipe every time. With Pampers wipes, they often got stuck together when I tried to pull one out- the wipes themselves have a quilted texture on them. This texture helps pick up and hold the waste. The Pampers wipes were too smooth of a finish, the poo just smeared everywhereI browsed over a dozen product listings for wipes. These were the most cost effective when it came down to $ per wipe. Even cheaper than the Amazon brand. Even cheaper than Costco.I am very pleased with my purchase. I would easily and highly recommend these wipes. I will purchase them again when needed.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Huggies Simply Clean Fragrance-Free Baby Wipes, and overall, I am quite satisfied with their performance. The pack contains 11 individual packs, totaling 704 wipes, making it a great value for money. The wipes are a lifesaver for quick clean-ups and diaper changes, especially when I'm on the go.One of the standout features of these wipes is their fragrance-free formula, ensuring my baby's sensitive skin is not exposed to any unnecessary irritants. The wipes are gentle and soft, providing a comfortable experience for my little one.Another positive aspect is their effectiveness in cleaning messes. They do a fantastic job of wiping away dirt and grime, leaving my baby's skin feeling fresh and clean.The packaging design is also convenient. The wipes are well-sealed, preventing them from drying out, and the flip-top lid allows for easy one-handed access when dealing with a wriggling baby.However, one minor concern I have noticed on occasion is that the wipes tend to tear while pulling them out of the package. While this doesn't happen all the time, it can be a bit frustrating during those moments when you need a wipe quickly.In conclusion, Huggies Simply Clean Fragrance-Free Baby Wipes are an excellent choice for parents seeking gentle and effective wipes for their little ones. The pack offers great value, and the wipes themselves are gentle and efficient. Despite the occasional tearing issue, I still find them to be a reliable option and would recommend them to other parents looking for convenient and fragrance-free baby wipes.",

Bidets are common in Europe, but here in North America they expect us to use our out-in-the-woods-skills like we are all maple-bacon-loving-lumberjacks in plaid, and tight jeans, Mukluks and Canada Goose jackets with no class.They are a staple in my bathroom routine and go anywhere I go. I have turned many people onto them as well without saying a word because I am telepathic like that.It is the only way to ensure that I am feeling squeaky clean not owning an essential life saving bidet. Because in Canada, we love being extra dirty.This has avoided getting UTIs ( urinary tract infections) for years now.So not only are they good for babies, but adults too. I never had an allergic reaction and I am sensitive to chemicals. They are perfume free, which is great.I highly recommend adding them to your bathroom routine. Toilet paper is not enough ever in my opinion. It\u2019s not like we have an auto A$$ wiper machine like the year 2035 will.",
