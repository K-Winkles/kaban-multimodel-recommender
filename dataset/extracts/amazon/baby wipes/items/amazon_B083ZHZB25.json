Good thing, because I wouldnt have otherwise found these wipes. While a bit pricier than my ordinary wipes, well worth it for the value and peace of mind. You know you're getting a high-quality product the second the wipe touches your fingertips-- non-irritating and soothing for those with allergies and sensitive skin (yes even adults). And they don't price-gouge and delivered in a timely basis. That alone was worth the five stars!",
