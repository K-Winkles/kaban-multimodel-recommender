                "reviewText": "These wipes are amazing! They are so soft yet durable. You can use them to wipe anything. As someone who tries to refrain from using chemicals and artificial scents, these are perfect. They\u2019re all natural, fragrance free and have absolutely no chemicals. Just put a little water and voila!What\u2019s crazy is that the wipes are super soft and gentle yet feel very heavy duty. They don\u2019t leave streak marks or break apart like regular paper towels or tissues. You can also let them dry and reuse them a couple of times before throwing them out.Also, given COVID and as a healthcare worker, I use these as disinfectant wipes too. Simply add a little alcohol on them and you can use them to wipe down surfaces, counters, phone screens, etc. I like to leave a pack in my living room, kitchen, car, and work bag because they always come in handy!I\u2019m so happy that I got these. I highly recommend!",

It can be a bit time taxing having to get them wet for they do come dry, however I use these babies for all sorts of things and always get such an amazing clean feeling. I use them to wipe down my couches, blanket on my bed, sheets b4 crawling into bed, if I\u2019m not able to change my sheets as scheduled! Plus, I have hard (WELL) water and I also use these to almost the wash by hand if you will after I put new fresh sheets in my bed. I spray the sheets first with filtered water, then the wipes, it\u2019s not soaking wet by no means, and the difference in how clean they feel, no words, but amazing! Leaves no lint behind ither that Inhave noticed. Very strong too. Not quite sure how or where the water even goes tho. I do need to re wet them quite a bit when using one, but whatever I\u2019m cleaning doesn\u2019t feel super wet ither, sooo\u2026",

The fact that cleaning wipes are so difficult to find if not extraordinarily pricey, these wipes are just what the doctor ordered. Use these for mildly stained surfaces or even areas that are heavily soiled. Just apply preferred cleaning solution or water and voila, just like your typical lysol or clorox wipe. These are also super soft and gentle enough for pets. Another poster shared this with an image of their adorable dog so we gave it a try. Our little fella loves getting belly rubs, so we use this after we go out to clean her down with and she is a HUGE fan. These multipurpose wipes are super convenient, ultra affordable, and made of high quality material. Store them in your car for those just in time cleaning moments and you don't have to worry about them drying up in the heat. Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "These wipes are so versatile and soft! Great to have in the car, and not worry about it drying out. Use them dry or wet with some added water. I like to use them for my hands when I\u2019m out . After using these for a few days, I\u2019ve found myself looking to place these in more areas that I frequently visit. It\u2019s great to have in the baby room, kitchen, work office, etc. On a hot day coming home from work it\u2019s a great way to wipe up the sweat . They they don\u2019t burn or dry out your skin . I\u2019d say they\u2019re great for babies bottoms and beyond ! Best part is that it\u2019s fragrance free and biodegradable. Buying more for backup.",

                "reviewText": "I'm so glad I found these cloud wipes! They're super soft, unscented, and chemical free so it's perfect for my super sensitive skin. My skin usually get irritated by certain wipes but not these cloud wipes. On top of that, it comes as a dry wipe so I don't have to worry about them drying up and going to waste. When I need to use them as a wet wipe, I simply spray some water on it and it's a perfectly soft wet wipe. As soft as these wipes are, they are also super durable and can be used to clean a wide range of surfaces as well. The compact packaging makes it easier to bring or store anywhere which makes it even more easy to use. These are definitely my go-to wipes from now on for everything!",
