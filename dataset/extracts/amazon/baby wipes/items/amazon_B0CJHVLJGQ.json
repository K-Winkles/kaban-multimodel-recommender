These dry wipes fit the bill completely.They\u2019re soft but sturdy, and don\u2019t tear easily. They can absorb quite a bit of liquid and that\u2019s important with toddler spills.They also work great if you spill things as an adult!I do wish they were in a more travel friendly container.",

So many times I'd go to clean up a mess, wipe a nose, or clean up drool or something like that and be stuck doing the job with a wet wipe. I feel like these dry wipes offer a better approach when trying to clean up a baby or toddler. No worries of a cold wet wipe creating an uncomfortable moment. However, water can be added to create a wet wipe if desired. These dry wipes are certainly ideal in a variety of scenarios. I like that they're thick, eco-friendly, free from harsh chemicals, fragrances, and bleach. I have used them for a variety of things, including cleaning up a number of spills and messes. I'd like to stress the importance of not flushing these. They are not made to flush. The appropriate disposal is to throw them in the trash.",

I prefer the wipes to already be wet enough to wipe up or clean something, otherwise I would use a paper towel.As far as using as intended, a diaper wipe, I find getting these wet before using an extra step I don\u2019t usually make time for, so I would always use a traditional diaper wipe over these.You could moisten these yourselves, but the box these come in is paper, so you will need another container to store these in that case.Overall, quite expensive for the purpose\u2026",
