                "reviewText": "These wipes work really great for really anything. You can add a little rubbing alcohol to one wipe to turn it into a disinfectant wipe to disinfect any surface that you want. On top of that you can use it for private areas to keep extra clean, or even as a makeup removal wipe as they have simple and honest ingredients to where they do not bother sensitive skin as I have very sensitive skin and it is very hard to find a wipe that does not bother my skin. These wipes are also great for cleaning up if you spray a surface and use them after to wipe the area, they are great for wiping your car or wiping up small messes around you. I love the fact that they just say honest on them and not baby wipes so it doesn't look like you're carrying around baby wipes for a baby when you don't have a baby! As an adult female you tend to need something to clean up after yourself even though you're not a baby, they are great for those menstrual cycle times as long as you don't flush them in the toilet of course, they are also great for wiping your hands and really for anything. I only wish buying a big pack of them was not as expensive as they are somewhat difficult to afford.",

Another brand I was using always left lint on my face after using, embarrassing seeing yourself in a mirror after walking around like that! I think the cost is very reasonable for what you are getting. Nice packaging and a durable wipe. The wipes have just the right amount of ingredients on them to not make your face really wet and sticky.Charlie B.Chelsea, Massachusetts",

                "reviewText": "I wear make up and do my best to take it off each night before I sleep. Sometimes I get lazy to wash it off, so I resort to wipes to do the job. When I do wash my face, there will be some residue around the perimeter of my face, so using a wipe to wipe off the excess make up has been helpful. I used to use Burt\u2019s bees wipes but didn\u2019t like them as much and couldn\u2019t find a value back that was economical to keep on purchasing. I discovered the honest wipes several months back and continue to purchase them. I like that they aren\u2019t drying and they do a decent good job of cleaning the face. The only thing I dislike is that I have to use wipes in the first place because it can be wasteful and costly to keep buying them but I try to use them sparingly as needed. I am also very sensitive to smells and these wipes don\u2019t bother me one bit. Happy with this product.",

                "reviewText": "I read a lot of reviews regarding the foul odor of these. I do notice that after washing my face there is a mildly unpleasant but mostly neutral odor. However, that \"negative\" is immediately countered by several things;-They clean very well. Picking up grease, dirt, grim, etc. (They aren't great at mechanical or car grease that you might get on your hands)-The number of towels is great. I'll never run out.-The moisture lid works surprisingly well(even after I broke it)-They are sturdy and don't tear very easily(definitely NOT flushable)Overall 4.5/5",
