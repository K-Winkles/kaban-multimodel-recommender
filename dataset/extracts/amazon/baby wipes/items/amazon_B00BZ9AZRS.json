I love that they are biodegradable. They smell great! Good ingredients. But my gosh I had to wipe hard for them to do the trick, and I change my baby frequently. I felt like they weren\u2019t wet enough. Any time my baby had a poopy diaper, I just got out other wipes because I didn\u2019t want to deal with it. I am so happy I just ran out! Woo hoo on to wetter wipes!",
