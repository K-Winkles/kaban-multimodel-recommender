These bamboo based wipes are soft and durable. They work just as good as the toilet wipes with just a spray of distilled water.Only draw back is you cannot flush them, but I bought a sealed trash can and I dispose of them that way. No smell and very environmental. Not to mention safer for your home plumbing.",

They also are good to have on hand in the purse during travel, work as a tissue/napkin as well. Good material. Only down side is they are a bit small, maybe that is good bc creates less waste, it is sufficient size just much smaller than your typical wipe. I will probably buy again. Does the job, I am happy with this product.",

                "reviewText": "I used these as an alternative to wet wipes on my baby. They are pretty good, soft and durable. The drawbacks is that the yellowish color blended in with my breastfed baby\u2019s yellow poop. So it was a bit hard to tell when there was no more poop to wipe. So i still ended up using white wet wipes. The material is so soft though. And pretty durable/thick.",

                "reviewText": "These are perfect for backpacking. Small and lightweight, but also durable. I mix a few drops of antibacterial essential oils to a little water in a 1oz craft bottle with a twist nozzle, shake, and squirt onto one of these dry wipes wadded up (they are very absorbent). Then I un-wad them and wash my face and then pits, private bits, and finally feet. Perfect lightweight way to clean and sanitize your face and body while on the trail to prevent skin infections and body odor. Since the wipes are bamboo and naturally antimicrobial, the used ones don't stink when you store the trash in your pack until you can dispose of them.",
