Takes a while to confirm I am getting the product I have been using. No negatives that I find with this product.",

Sometimes two come out of the dispenser and I just push one back in and close the lid. I usually store them with the lid on the bottom to keep them the wettest possible. I also use the sticky papers that were used to keep the three packages together for an additional cover to keep the lid closed tight. I really do not like the lid on the dispenser but the wipes are great! There is little scent to the wipes.",
