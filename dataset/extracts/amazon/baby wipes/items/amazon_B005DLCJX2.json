                "reviewText": "I have tried all different brands of wipes for my children in order to save a few pennies. The cheaper brands are just that: cheap. No other brand of wipes cleans as nice, is as sturdy, or as fresh smelling as Pampers. While I do admit they are more money, paying the extra is worth it for my kids. I try to make the difference up by waiting for sales and using coupons. It is worth the effort. I wouldn't trust any other wipe next to my childrens' skin. I even use them for myself from time to time. They are gentle and last long. You only need one or two, compared to double that of the competitor's brands. Pampers baby fresh wipes are great! They are the only wipes we use. Extremely great value and such great quality. We have used store brands before but we ended up using more wipes than we would if we would have just used papmpers wipes.Also, Beside the pampers baby fresh wipes being the best smelling wipes ever, they clean like no other! I have used every wipe on the market trying to match the smell and endurance of pampers wipes and not any come close! There is nothing I hate worse than pulling a wipe out of a wipe warmer and it tearing or smelling terrible because of the prolonged heating element and pampers wipes never disappoint. They never tear because of the way they are woven together and the smell is long lasting and masks the instant smell of a dirty diaper. The smell is very baby and refreshing! Love these wipes!!! Thank you pampers for making such a great product that i plan to use for many years to come",

                "reviewText": "We've been using these wipes for years! They're perfect for kids with sensitive skin, and the quality is superb. They hold up very well and stay nice and moist. You can use just one wipe for most diaper changes. They're well worth the price. My son has had bad eczema and has gotten rashes since birth from any type of lotion - these wipes have been a life saver! We've tried other non-scented or sensitive wipes and have found that the quality doesn't compare to the pampers brand. Some non-scented actually put off a non pleasant smell, while the pampers are great. These wipes are also thicker than others we've tried.Not only are they great for their intended purpose, but I have a two year old who LOVES to help clean. I don't want him cleaning with any harmful products so instead I give him a package of these wipes and let him go to town. He loves being able to help, and I love knowing that they're sensitive enough to not harm him while still letting him actually CLEAN things (and of course I'm still watching him closely to make sure he doesn't actually try to put any in his mouth). They have SO many other uses beyond just this!",

                "reviewText": "When my son was born we were first using the Kirkland brand baby wipes that all my friends/family raved about (we had received a box as a baby present). After only a few weeks our little boy had such a bad rash and a friend recommended switching wipes - so I thought i'd give these a try. Diaper rash disappeared in two days flat!!!! They are as soft and wet and wonderful as any wipe needs to be - in fact I usually only need to use one wipe per diaper change, sometimes two if its REALLY bad (and you moms know what i'm talking about there). The only thing that some moms might not like is that they are very wet and it sometimes feels slightly slimy. For me, it just makes it easier to clean,particularly with those sticky diapers and if i'm in a picky mood about it I just put some baby powder on him and problem solved!Bottom line - Get these wipes. They are cheap and perfect for any baby bottom ESPECIALLY if your baby has a sensitive bum like mine does :)",

                "reviewText": "I had previously purchased s box of pampers sensitive wipes from Target ($15.99 for 576 wipes) when prpearing for our baby to arrive. After we used up the Pampers supply, I turned to a stock of Huggies wipes that we received as a gift. Comparing these top two brands of baby wipes, my personal opinion is that Pampers brand far exceed Huggies for the following reasons:1. Pampers are much thicker and more durable. When removing them from the packaging (I've used the refill packs, individual pop top packs and plastic tub packs) they come out easily. Huggies wipes seemed to rip more often than not when removing them from their packaging.2. Pampers wipes have more moisture content. They make wiping easy and smooth and I dont feel like I'm rubbing hard to removed any residue off of baby. Huggies wipes felt dried out in comparison to the Pampers. I felt like I was rubbing baby's bottom raw and noticed her bottom started to turn red after just one day of using them.Specifically reviewing this Amazon purchase of Pampers wipes, I give this purchase 5 stars. Price wise, the value is great compared to in store purchases. Sometimes additional coupons are even offered on Amazon, making the purchase an even better deal!",

                "reviewText": "We've used these since my baby was born and love them. The size of the wipe, strength of each wipe, and the moistness of each wipe is just perfect to wipe your baby's bum. We've tried Seventh Generation, Honest Baby, Earth's Best as they have less harsh chemicals than the big brands like Pampers or Huggies-however, the Earth's Best was WAY too foamy and I felt like there was a layer of foamy soap on my daughter's bum every time I used them. All three of those \"natural\" brands were also too thin and flimsy, which is really terrible when you're trying to clean up messy poo! These Pampers Sensitive wipes are a great value and did not seem to bother my daughter's sensitive skin. You can also easily pull out one wipe at a time without them all clinging to each other when pulling them out of the wipes container. This is unlike the \"natural\" brands which seriously all tend to stick to each other making me waste more wipes than I needed to use in the first place.",
