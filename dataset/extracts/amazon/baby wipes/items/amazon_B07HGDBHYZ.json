They are soft, and doesn\u2019t leave you with any film or unpleasant feeling on your hands. No urge to rewash your hands after using these (like some hand sanitizers). The wipes are super soft and very durable. We love having one of these in the glove box of the car at all times. They\u2019re great even as kids get older to help clean hands after eating, before jumping back on an iPad or gaming device. I definitely recommend these.",

Love that they are safe for the face, they don't leave a soapy or greasy film, and the scent is very light. I keep one in the car, but now that the kids are older, and we use them slower, I do double bag them in a zip-loc bag to keep them from drying out. We have had some packs that have taken us up to six months to use, and they stay in good condition without any molding or anything for that period of time. I had one kid with eczema and three of us with skin that is sporadically sensitive, and we have never had trouble with these.",
