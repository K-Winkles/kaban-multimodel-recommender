                "reviewText": "For the environment, I refuse to use anything but biodegradable. I switched from water wipes the moment I found out that they weren\u2019t biodegradable. Tried Aleva for the first time and I\u2019m not really impressed nor am I unsatisfied. I just wanna try another brand.The packaging is probably the most annoying part. Every time I open up a new one, I have to tear a bigger hole because idk what tiny fingers can reach inside the package to grab the wipe. Ofc they don\u2019t use glue to hold the wipes together so when you pull it doesn\u2019t always follow. So you\u2019re gunna be putting your finger in that hole multiple times in one change. You\u2019re gunna need to break the hole open so you don\u2019t struggle so much when ya need it.You also would need on average 4 baby wipes per doo doo changing. Much much more for the messy ones.I\u2019m okay with the lemon scent. I love lemon but it\u2019s a very odd smell for baby wipes lol. I associate lemon with cleaning products, not my baby\u2019s tush.No rash, no pink/red bottom. So it\u2019s gentle enough for my boy.Currently searching for another biodegradable baby wipe brand to try out. \ud83d\ude29 I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend to friends. Instead I\u2019m asking them lol",

I guess if you have an allergy to almonds just maybe that would cause it - don\u2019t forget everyone is unique. To me there is no smell and I can smell literally anything at a much greater height than a normal person - yes we do exist, research us. Is the hole small enough to reach it every time or that you have to get it one by one - doesn\u2019t bother me. What bothers me is that the company has a mega pack at 900 something and Amazon just refuses to sell it here. Can we get you to sell the mega pack please for these wipes and the feminine ones because it isn\u2019t fair that the company can\u2019t ship to the US and you do have a choice to sell the mega packs but yet you refuse.",

The wipes themselves are big, but I don't use them for a baby, I use them on myself. So I just tear one in half and put the other half back in the package, make it last twice as long haha. 6 come in each box. It will take me a while to get through them so I'll be gifting them for sure. LOVE that they're biodegradable AND body friendly. 10/10 would recommend",

                "reviewText": "I've been using these wipes for about 6 months now. I use them in a wipe warmer so I add distilled water to them and they stay nice and moisturized in the warmer. They don't cause any skin irritation to my sensitive skin babe. They're a good size, thick, feed decently (could definitely be improved though), smell clean, decent amount of moisture when not using in wipe warmer, convenient resealable package for diaper bag. The package is TOO hard to break open though! I've sliced my thumb on the plastic ring on top trying to break into these wipes. Super annoying. You can't just rip them open like you would a bag of chips, you have to peel off the plastic ring, take the sticker part off, and then rip the bag open from that hole. It's ridiculously inconvenient. But, the ingredients are worth the pain of opening a pack every couple of days.",

I like the way they easily clean up dirty hands and messes so easily without leaving a residue on my skin. They\u2019re unscented as well which is perfect for adults and babies especially. They also come in a formula for sensitive skin. I\u2019ve recently started buying these wipes from Amazon as the price is amazing and I get more for my money. The wipes are also biodegradable which is great.",

They have a light, un-offensive scent that doesn't linger on your skin. They leave my face very soft & do an adequate job removing make up. A good wash is always needed regardless of the wipe but these help with stubborn eye makeup & no chemical burn or irritation.My only concern is the light amount of moisture & what little moisture there is dissipates very quickly. I usually need 2 of them to complete the job making them rather expensive compared to other options.",
