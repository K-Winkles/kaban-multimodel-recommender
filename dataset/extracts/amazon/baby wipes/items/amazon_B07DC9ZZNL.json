I like that the package is small and easily will fit in a diaper bag without taking up much space. My only issue with the product was I wish it was a bit more moist to make it easier to wipe away messes. I find myself having to use 2 wipes when our little one eats. Overall I like these wipes and will buy them again. Our little one doesn't have sensitive skin and these were fine on her skin and it doesn't have a perfume like over powering scent which I like as well.",
