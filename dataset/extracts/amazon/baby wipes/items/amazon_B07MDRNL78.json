                "reviewText": "I've tried many other wipes in my search to find something less expensive. But I have to keep going back to Huggies because of the quality. The material of the wipes for Huggies grips well and doesn't slide on itself when you're trying to wipe. They are soft and they are a nice size. I usually get the scented kind and the scent is very pleasant and mild. I've never noticed any irritation from any of the sense. Huggies is just a great quality product. Huggies please don't ever change the quality of the material. Every other brand that I've used slides on itself when folded which makes it really hard not to make a mess.",
