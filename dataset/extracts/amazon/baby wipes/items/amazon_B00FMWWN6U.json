Urine and bowel movements have pH levels that vary from baby's skin and are further affected by diet and health. When higher or lower pH levels contact skin, they can cause irritation. To help prevent irritation, pH must be balanced or neutralized Do Pampers wipes come with a pop-top? Yes!

We immediately had to change over what brand of diapers we used and we have tried tons of different creams, but she has always done well with these wipes. As we had more kids, we kept returning to these. They are much softer than some other wipes and a good thickness. I feel like I can get a lot with these. These are hands down our favorite wipes.",
