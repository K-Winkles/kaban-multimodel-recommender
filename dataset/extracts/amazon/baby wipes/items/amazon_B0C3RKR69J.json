What I like most is the texture of the wipes, it really helps clean whatever mess you\u2019re using it for. This was the first time purchasing this brand and we will continue to do so. The price is less compared to the other two brands I mentioned but the quality/value is better.",

That presents a number of problems, especially for personal cleanliness.After using TP to remove most of the\u2026stuff, these wipes are handy for keeping things neat and tidy where the sun doesn\u2019t shine. Don\u2019t flush them. I wrap them in a lysol wipe and toss them, but you could use whatever cleaner you have, or even baking soda, to eliminate unpleasant odors.The wipes are also convenient for a quick hand cleaning at your bedside if you can\u2019t walk to the bathroom for whatever reason. If you have to temporarily delay bathing because you\u2019re not well enough to stand up in the shower, the wipes are convenient. They don\u2019t have any scent. I would love it if they had a gentle baby powder scent and were thicker, but I will would but them again.",
