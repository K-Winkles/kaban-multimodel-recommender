The one drawback is that they can be difficult to get out of the package one at a time, but, on the flip side, they are not intertwined to pull one after the other \u2014 helps to keep the packet closed and the wipes moist.",

                "reviewText": "I use these wipes for everything from wiping my sons face after he\u2019s finished eating his meals to wiping his hands when they are dirty from playing outside. The package is small enough to keep it in my purse for on the go cleaning, from small spills in the car to just having to wipe my own hands. The wipes pull easily out of the package and if closes securely enough that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything opening and getting anything in my purse wet. The only thing I would change is the size of the wipes, maybe half the size would be better so I can use two for bigger messes instead of a larger one for small messes then the whole thing goes to waste and I go through the package faster. Other than that this is a pretty great product and I still recommend it.",
