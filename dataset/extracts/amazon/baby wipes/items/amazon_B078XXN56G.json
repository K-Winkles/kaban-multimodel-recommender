                "reviewText": "Honestly, this is exactly what I ordered. We don\u2019t have any kids, I don\u2019t purchase them for those reasons. My husband and I usually buy the boxes from Costco of the Kirkland brand close to monthly. We keep these wipes in our cars for hands cleaning, in our RV, in the bathrooms, craft rooms, and use them for quick clean up of dog messes, or spills, etc. They are quick and easy and can keep them everywhere! We use to purchase the Walmart generic brand wipes which were the cheapest, but I\u2019ve learned they crumble almost, and you need to use more than one for a \u201csmall\u201d job. The huggies are thicker, don\u2019t crumble, and are softer (and no weird smells). Kirkland are still my favorite, more wipes, same price, good quality, but honestly sometimes I just really don\u2019t want to drive to Costco just for wipes, since it\u2019s packed, and a good 20-25 minute drive. So I\u2019d rather order these from Amazon which I know are reliable, and just have them dropped off a day or two later. Can\u2019t go wrong!",

Many wipes are thin, too small to cover the hand of the changer, not soft. Simply unsuitable for the job. Huggies are worth the extra price over bargain brands that require twice as many wipes, negating any savings at all. We stick with this brand and this particular product. We love the subscription feature, with it, we never run out!",

You only have to use a even on messy diaper changes. And the flip top packs are easy to get into, and stay sealed well. Also i like the smell of both the fresh scent, and the fragrence free, just nice and fresh and no sticky residue, so you can use them for everything (wiping hands and face too)",

They smell great, which ro me means there is zero scent. And the the packages dont leak, which is a huge plus. They clean really well too. They just arent the softest wipe. They feel kind of papery. And they will burn a diaper rash. And sometimes I feel like your fingers my smell bad after using it I'd I dont double the wipes up.
