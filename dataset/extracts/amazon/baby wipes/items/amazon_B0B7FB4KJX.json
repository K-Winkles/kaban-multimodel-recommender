They dont fall apart nor does your finger poke through them. Im very sensitive to smells and these are virtually scent free. They have a tiny scent if you bury your nose in them. They have enough moisture to clean but are not sloppy wet and are large enough that I dont need 2 each time I use the rest room. I shop Wmart to get the best price on generic items and these are less per pkg and softer than their large house brand wipes. I'm sold on these and will continue to buy as long as everything stays the same. I'm sure it was a fluke if someone got something so bad they had to give these 1 star. Dont be afraid to buy these.",

                "reviewText": "These are very good wipes! I highly recommend them. The size is perfect & being unscented is better for skin.I spent lots of time reading reviews & then comparing price, quantity, size (6.7\" x 8\"), thickness, moisture, type of packaging, & how they exit the package when used. (Some reviewers expected the wipes to \"pop up\" like a dry tissue when pulled. That, in my view, is not reasonable for a wet wipe.)Read & compare the product descriptions regarding additives & fibers used. The Nice & Clean wipes are ideal.These have the \"lift type\" plastic opening that snaps closed to avoid drying out.These would not be suitable for a countertop box as they have their own closure & are not packaged as the \"refill peal off sticker\" type.There are 56 to a package, just right for take along. (Or pull out several to a zip lock type bag.) Great for the car or shopping.The size is excellent as they can easily be torn in half for makeup or counter wiping. The size is ideal for personal use or for little folks bottoms.Hope these observations may be helpful in your decision to buy! I will continue to reorder Nice & Clean.",

They are strong, they don't fall apart in your fingers, and they large enough, and moist enough, to do the job with just one or two wipes.What do i use them for? They are great for dogs too! Our bulldog sometimes needs to be cleaned up a little after \"doing his big business\", and one wipe takes care of things. I hope the company offers these wipes forever!",
