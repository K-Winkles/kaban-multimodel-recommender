                "reviewText": "I was reluctant to use these due to the mass production focus of Kirkland products but I did a bit of research. Tencel, the fabric cannot be flushed but it is biodegradable (lyocell fiber is the technical name and it's made from wood pulp or cellulose). The other natural and unscented ingredients are no different than products like 7th generation. The price is good. What I like the most is that the Tencel material does not pill up and leave any pills or fabric residue on your skin even if you use it on rough surfaces of your body (i.e. hair or razor stubble). Unfortunately this is a problem I have found with other brands. This is important to me since I use them on myself and adults, not on the soft hairless skin of a baby.",
