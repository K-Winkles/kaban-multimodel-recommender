                "reviewText": "These are soft to the touch, work extremely well and don\u2019t have an over powering smell. They are great for many different uses, a quick wipe for the hands and face.. diaper changes.. etc.While they aren\u2019t textured or \u201cthick\u201d like other brands that I\u2019ve tried, they work just as well. They are much thinner but no less absorbent.The down side (not enough of a down side imo) They do stretch though. So if you\u2019re pulling one out and it gets stuck.. the wipe can stretch and sometimes rip if it gets stuck on the diaper. So just be mindful of that.The plastic bit that covers the hole the wipes come out of is too flimsy and comes off easily as well. Easily in the case of leaving the bag in the diaper bag and it gets caught easily. Again. Just something to be mindful of. I keep them now in a big plastic bag of their own.Again. Not enough of a down side too outweigh the fact that they are truly clean and non toxic for my baby at an affordable price. Especially on subscription.",

He has sensitive skin and these work great for him. They are much softer and I can smell the difference too (is that weird?). The old wipes smell so strong to me now. So glad The Natural Minded Momma recommended these. They are the most affordable non-tox, disposable wipes I have been able to find. Win!!",

Non-toxic, mild, good ingredients, fragrance free, and chlorine free are imperative in a wipe for my children. These wipes fit the bill! I am very sensitive to smells, and, although these do have a scent, it is not offensive or strong. I also like that these wipes come in smaller packages than some so it's lighter to carry in my bag. Cons? The sticker type closure and wetness of the wipes. I prefer a plastic top that closes securely. Although better than wipes that are too dry, these wipes are actually too wet and sudsy sometimes. Overall very good wipes, in my opinion.",

                "reviewText": "These may be my favorite baby wipes. They are soft, very moist, no strong odors or chemicals. But they are expensive, so I will hesitate to purchase them again unless the packaging changes. First off, the wipes don\u2019t come apart easily. You need two hands to pull out a wipe, so that you can test it apart from the next wipe. As most parents know, that\u2019s not ideal when dealing with a squirming baby. Ultimately, I often wind up using more wipes than needed. The second complaint I have about the packaging is the piece of plastic that is supposed to keep the package sealed close. It loses its stickiness once I open the package and doesn\u2019t reattach. I would give the wipes 5 stars, but the packaging issues bring down my overall rating.",

Particularly when they're on offer at \u00a315-\u00a316 for a box of 12 packs. I've had 5 bulk boxes now and never had any problems with the packaging. Sure they stick together occasionally, so do all of them, but these no more than others. They really are kind on babys bottom and face etc and have no real smell at all. They're damp enough and don't dry out. I love that they're vegan and biodegradable, our planet needs more of this due to the crisis coming up if we don't act now!Overall.. I wouldn't use another brand ever again!",

                "reviewText": "We are now on our second bulk lot of this wipe and like them for a few reasons. 1. Made in the UK 2.Biodegradable 3. Contains aloe 4. Price isn't bad. 5. Good moisture content. The only negative and the reason why I gave 4 and not 5 stars is due to the wipes sticking together making it very difficult to extract a wipe with one hand while the other is occupied with holding the baby up. We now extract the wipes before we start but there are always times when you need just 1 more and then have to try to wip it out of the pack quickly to unstick it from the others. This rarely works and normally results in us getting 3 or 4 wipes stuck together.",
