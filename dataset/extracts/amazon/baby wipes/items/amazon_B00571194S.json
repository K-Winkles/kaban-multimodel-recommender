They smell AMAZING, they are never too wet or too dry, and they have the perfect amount of stretch and grip, so I use far fewer than I did with other brands, rarely more than one for a change. We cloth diaper our little dude, and use cloth wipes as well but want some disposable wipes for poop and on-the-go, but I hate to use polyester ones that won't break down in landfill and I want safe, gentle ingredients. Used Jackson Reece for a long time, but they increasingly would not pop up when you pulled one out and left you digging, we finally got fed up with it. I like water wipes, but not biodegradable. Tried Honest, Joonya, and others, but then Natracare and I loved them from the very first one, they're perfect!!!",
