My go-to has always been Huggies Natural Care, which is great. But even with those, my boys would sometimes get discolored patches on their cheeks since they have very sensitive skin. I have not had that problem with proudly wipes yet. They are durable and easy to handle. I love the packaging look, but the heart can be a bit tough at times. Otherwise, these wipes are awesome!",

                "reviewText": "This review is going to be in comparison to Water Wipes, which is our usual disposable wipe brand.The PROUDLY wipes remove easily from the package. They don't have any added fragrance, which is great! They're less moist than Water Wipes. They slide well on the skin - I think that might be due to the glycerin? The PROUDLY wipes are about equally effective as Water Wipes at removing stool from a one year old during a diaper change. There may have been some minor increased irritation, but nothing significant and is likely more due to a transition period than anything else.It's not clear if the wipes are 100% plant-derived vicose or not - if they are, it would be nice if they could make that clear since it's a struggle to find plastic-free wipes for anyone concerned about their environmental impact.",
