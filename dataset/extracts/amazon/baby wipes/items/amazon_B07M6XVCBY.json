These wipes are outstanding and the price....you can't beat the price point. These wipes are tough. They are thick my little baby has some messy jobs and two wipes do the trick. They are great for sensitive skin. My.baby is 3 months old and we have not experienced any diaper rash or rash from these wonderful wipes. They also hold strong for my dogs paws.He is a wonderful pit bull and his paws get cleaned after every outside walk again these wipes do not rip fall apart. They are unscented Hypoallergenic and I just love these wipes. I even use them for myself. Great for removing eye makeup with your favorite make up remover. I also use them for personal use. These wipes also last me a month. I have looked at all other places for all these wipes at this price and Amazon beats every store out there. I am a Huggies fanatic. I highly recommend these wipes. Great price durable great for my babies gentle skin. This is one happy Mommy. Oh also not toxic to my doggie that licks his paws.Love Huggies. Oh I did the pull test where you tug on the wipes and these are extremely sturdy. I cant say enough. Also Amazon got these delivered on Easter Sunday...thank you!",

                "reviewText": "These huggies wipes are the best wipes hands down!!! As a mom of two toddlers, I have tried pretty much every wipe that there is on the market. As a new mom I was looking for a wipe that was free of all the harsh chemicals that you here about on the web and in magazines etc. As I was preparing for the arrival of my first born I though that pampers was the top brand but I wasn't sure.... So I purchased a few packs of wipes to try out. Upon opening the pampers wipes and the huggies wipes it was clear to see that the huggies wipe was of way better quality. The pampers wipe is not as strong and durable as the huggies wipe. I then compared all of the different \"models\" that each brand had. Clearly, when it came to my baby, I wanted to use the purest wipe that was available while still doing the job and ensuring that my baby is clean and fresh after their diaper change. This wipe from Huggies is made of mostly water and having babies with extremely sensitive skin, I have never had a reaction from these wipes even with the worst diaper rashes we were still able to use these wipes. I would recommend these wipes to anyone looking for a high quality wipe that is great for baby. I order them via the subscribe and save feature on Amazon so I don't have to worry about running out of wipes and I am getting the best price available.",

                "reviewText": "These are great, basic baby wipes! We've been using them for about three years now. Every now and then, we buy different brands that are on sale and such, but always end up purchasing these again. They are perfect for pretty much any job: wiping faces, hands, bottoms, high chairs... They also seem to be more gentle on baby's bottom than other brands we've tried. I've used them on two babies from their very first day, and never noticed any problems with irritation or sensitivity. They also have a nice thickness to them, they hold up very well and don't rip easily.I also love that these are refills... Huggies is the only brand I know of that offers baby wipe refills. You can buy these super cute plastic tubs, and then just refill them. They look so much better around the house than the regular plastic packs. We keep one in the bedroom, the kitchen, and the living room, so we always have wipes on hand when needed. This particular pack of wipes does NOT come with a dispenser, so you'll have to purchase one separately. Once you have one, it's super easy to refill . I highly recommend these wipes to anyone!",

                "reviewText": "When I first brought my newborn home, we used Pampers Pure wipes we had been gifted and absolutely loved them. But they were really expensive, so we got some from Costco. Those were not very soft at all (even though they're labeled as such), so I started looking for an affordable brand that didn't make my kid's skin look like I was wiping him with sandpaper.These wipes are a good middle ground at an affordable price. They're soft enough for newborns, and I feel they clean better than some of the \"all natural\" wipes I've sampled.One thing to note is that each of the wipe \"bags\" have a zip-loc top, not a snap-down flap/lid like most wipe packaging. It's not a big deal but it does require two hands to close it, so I've sometimes forgotten during a 2am diaper change and had to throw out the top wipe because it will dry out.Pros:- Affordable- Soft- Clean wellCons:- Packaging- You need to tear each wipe from the previous one, something that sometimes is tricky with one hand",

                "reviewText": "We've been experimenting with different wipe brands since our little one was born, and these seemed like a great option for the wipe warmer.PROS:- Soft, absorbent.- Good size.- I eventually figured out that there is a separator for approximately how many go in a warmer (at first, was VERY frustrated that it was hard to get full load to go continuously because I transferred several smaller stacks).- Essentially scent-less.- I like that there are two individually zipped pouches to minimize them drying out.CONS:- VERY wet. You'd think wetness is a given, but when the wipes as this wet, I've needed to wait for my little one's bum to dry off a bit before putting on the diaper to avoid diaper rash.UPDATE: As a first time mom, it took me a while to decide on what's my favorite, but these made it to the top the list! Now with a toddler, we use the separate packs of this wipe and wouldn't switch to anything else unless forced to. Great even for runny noses!",
