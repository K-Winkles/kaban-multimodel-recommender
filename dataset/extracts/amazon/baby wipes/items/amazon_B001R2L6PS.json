The everFRESH system was invented to solve a problem. How do you keep all the wipes warm, especially reusable cloth wipes? From the bottom up. After all, heat rises. The everFRESH pillow consists of billions of tiny chambers that are saturated with water and an anti-microbial solution. The saturated pillow is placed in the Water Reservoir, a special tray designed to keep it elevated from the heating surface. As the pillow is warmed, water vapor and the anti-microbial molecules are slowly released into the wipes chamber keeping the reusable cloth wipes warm, moist, fresh, and clean. The entire stack of bamboo cloth wipes is warmed ... bottom to top ... with no yellow, dried out wipes. The everFRESH System keeps cloth wipes moist by an evaporation and condensation process. Highly dense micropores in the pillow trap and release water as needed to maintain moisture content. Both the wipe warmer tub and the everFRESH pillow are treated with a proprietary germ-fighting additive to inhibit the growth of microorganisms that may cause spoilage, odors, and mildew. Parents love knowing their baby is getting the freshest diaper change possible while using the everFRESH pillow. How often do the pillows need to be replaced? Every 3 months.

                "reviewText": "I've been using a combination of these wipes and Babykicks for 5 months now. These wipes are bulkier than the Babykicks, so fewer fit in the warmer. However, they are very soft and textured nicely to clean baby's bum effectively. The instructions do say not to put them in the dryer; when I did by accident, two of them did fray at the edges.However, I avoid this problem easily by keeping a mesh lingerie bag near our changing table and placing the dirties in there. When it's time to wash, I zip the bag, throw it in the wash, and pull the bag out between washer and dryer. Using this method, the Warmies are actually outlasting the Babykicks (which I also like), which are starting to become thin with wear. It also convenient because when baby wears G-diapers, I can throw the plastic liners in and keep them out of the dryer, too. Overall, I recommend as long as you can find an easy laundering routine.",

The towels are extremely soft on new skin and hold the perfect amount of moisture for cleaning up messy diapers. I never used the warmer, but my kids never minded cold water. The only down side is that they tend to fray if not washed carefully according to the instructions. I tend to be rough on laundry and don't always follow the directions, so that's my fault. Otherwise they hold up well.",

                "reviewText": "Received these along with the Prince Lionheart wipes warmer at my baby shower and thought they were both totally unecessary...but kept them since it was a well-meant gift. Now I think of these as indispensible! Gets the baby cleaner than disposable wipes, with no chemicals and no waste.As stated in other reviews, the bamboo material is somewhat delicate and may fray at the edges- IF you don't care for them. But care is simple! I keep a lingerie bag next to the changing table and place used wipes in it. When I get 5 or so wipes soiled, I toss the whole bag in the washer with other baby clothes or cloth diapers. You don't need to dry them (they're WET wipes!) This has worked great, my baby is now 4 months old and we're still using the original wipes. We do also use other, thinner cotton wipes (available on Amazon also), generally for pee-only diaper changes. But these thicker bamboo ones are fabulous for cleaning up poopy messes!My favorite part is that I mix a few drops of tea tree oil, lavender oil, olive oil and organic baby soap in 2 cups of water and pour this mix over the wipes before putting them in the warmer. The end result is a soft, warm wipe that smells great, softens baby's skin AND we've never had diaper rash! LOVE this product!----UPDATE: my baby is now 8 months old and we're still using the same wipes, which get washed in hot water every few days, and I'm now too lazy to mess with the lingerie bag ;) They just go in the wash with the diapers and that's that. Oh, sometimes they go through the dryer too. A couple have frayed at the edge but we still use them. Am back today to order more since we never use disposable wipes any more. These are great!",

I wish they'd make a colored version so I could buy them for facecloths and keep them separate.
