She would wake up with her eye shut and was desperate to try to help. Now like everyone else, you are scared to try thing on your newborn but these wipes are a must. I tried to cure her eyes for about 2 months like her pediatrician suggested but didn\u2019t seem to work. Within 2 days of using these wipes, I saw a HUGE difference, I was mind blown. Her eye completely cleared and I still use it to clean her eye if there is any lint or fuss in there to clean it out. Will definitely recommend 1000%",

                "reviewText": "I have had blepharitis for nearly 30 years and have seen several opthamologists for treatment. All have prescribed steroids and/or antibiotic ointments like Tobradex that have already caused noticeable damage to my eyes - not surprising after 3 decades of use. Earlier this year I stumbled across these eyelid wipes on Amazon and thought I would give them a try. I have been using them for six months now and have been able to keep the blepharitis under control without using any medications. I prefer the BABY eyelid wipes to the 'adult' version because they have more texture that works better for clearing debris, and it just feels better to use. The only difference between the two is the saturation of the liquid solution on the wipe (says so on Dr Fischer website and it is very noticeable between the two wipes). Since it is more saturated the 'adult' version feels like it has less texture than the BABY version, and the excess solution runs into my eyes with the adult version (this doesn't sting or cause any irritation to my eyes, but I don't like it). I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR BLEPHARITIS SUFFERERS.",
