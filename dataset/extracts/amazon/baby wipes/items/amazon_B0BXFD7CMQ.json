We usually use water wipes but have been very frustrated with the packaging as the wipes are hard to remove.These wipes are super easy to take out of the package (one handed, and during big messes!), AND they are much larger than the wipes water wipes makes. They are very wet and clean up easy. Plus they smell wonderful.The only con is that our son is getting a diaper rash. He was starting to get one with the water wipes as I don\u2019t think they were cleaning him very well, so we are unsure if it\u2019s wipe related or not, but have been using earth mama\u2019s diaper cream which has been working wonders.Overall, we are happy, but will see if we decide to order again!",
