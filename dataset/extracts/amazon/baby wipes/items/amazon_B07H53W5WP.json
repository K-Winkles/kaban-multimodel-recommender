Is this product different from the discontinued 810-count Amazon Elements Baby Wipes? Yes it is. A manufacturing defect caused accelerated oxidation and discoloration in our now-discontinued 810-count wipes. This defect does not affect our 720-count packages, which have been rigorously tested to meet our quality and safety standards. Can I use these baby wipes to clean other parts of my baby? Yes. Amazon Elements Baby Wipes are safe for cleaning your baby's hands, feet, face, and diaper area. Baby wipes should not be used to clean inside your baby's mouth, nose, ears, or eyes. What ingredients do you keep out of your baby wipes? Amazon Elements Baby Wipes do not contain dyes, parabens, phthalates, or alcohol. Can I rehydrate baby wipes that have dried out? Unfortunately, no. Our baby wipes are manufactured using pharmaceutical-grade purified water to keep them clean and effective; adding tap or bottled water might cause discoloration, odor, or even unwanted growths on the wipes.",

The recommended shelf life of Amazon Elements Baby Wipes is two years.",

These wipes are incredibly gentle on my baby's sensitive skin, yet effective enough to tackle even the messiest situations. The fact that they are fragrance-free is a huge plus, ensuring no irritation or allergic reactions. They are also very moist, which makes cleaning up easier, and they don't dry out quickly like some other brands. The packaging is convenient, easy to open, and reseals well to keep the wipes fresh. I appreciate the transparency in ingredients and manufacturing process provided by Amazon Elements. Definitely a five-star product and a staple for any parent!",

They're not just for babies \u2013 they've been amazing for all messes. We initially bought them when we had our child seven years ago and never stopped our subscription. We take them on picnics, park play dates, or road trips. The material is durable and doesn't rip apart like other brands. There has never been a surprise cleaning up a mess where our hands touched something we didn't want.The packaging could have some improvements in that occasionally, the plastic part where the wipes come out sometimes comes off. Most times, we can stick it back on, but there are the occasional moments when the glue to keep it there gives up, and it winds up drying out. Even if they dry out, though, they are still excellent for cleaning up wet spills like juice.",

The texture would always be too rough - like sandpaper or the wipe would be too large or too small. I heard about the Amazon Elements wipes from another mom friend and tried it. WOW it really is the best. It's soft texture (not as soft as waterwipes, but similar) and perfect sheet size won me over and the price is amazing! One wipe container can last us a whole month (this is with a newborn). There are a lot of wipes in there and they always stay wet as long as you keep the top closed. I have these wipes on subscription because we love them so much!",

                "reviewText": "I am so conflicted about these wipes. The wipes themselves are great. They aren't too thick or thin, they aren't too wet, and therefore don't rip quickly like some other brands. They are great and affordable.The issue, the plastic packaging. This thing is so LOUD lol. You pick it up and try to pull one out, and it's just so annoying. Might just be a pet peeve of mine but it seems like the plastic is just such bad quality or something. Also, not sure if it's related, but sometimes the wipes get stuck and you end up pulling out more than one at a time.If for example, you are using these to refill a container. PERFECT.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Amazon Elements Baby Wipes in the fragrance-free option, in a bulk pack of 810 wipes. As a parent, I am always looking for convenient and high-quality products that are gentle on my baby's skin, so I decided to give these wipes a try.One of the standout features of this product is the sheer quantity of wipes included in the pack. With 810 wipes, I don't have to worry about running out anytime soon. This is particularly helpful during those moments when my baby needs frequent diaper changes or when I need to clean up spills and messes. The bulk packaging also ensures that the wipes remain fresh and ready for use.In terms of quality, these wipes have exceeded my expectations. They are incredibly soft and gentle, making them perfect for my baby's sensitive skin. I appreciate that they are fragrance-free, as it reduces the risk of any skin irritation or allergies. Despite being gentle, the wipes are still effective at thoroughly cleaning and removing dirt, making diaper changes quick and easy.Overall, I am highly satisfied with the Amazon Elements Baby Wipes in the fragrance-free option. The 810-count bulk pack ensures that I have an ample supply of wipes on hand, while the sensitive and high-quality formula provides peace of mind for my baby's delicate skin.

These felt a lot dryer to the touch than other brand wipes that feel soaking wet, but I think it\u2019s just the material used because they clean just as good. I thought they were defective and all dried out but I gave them a shot anyway. They\u2019re perfect! This is a nice for feature since babies often don\u2019t like a cold wet wipe on their bum.
