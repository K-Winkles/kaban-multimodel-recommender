They were excellent wipes very soft to baby skin, clean very well, lightly scented, expensive but worth it. It appears those wipes have been discontinued. These new wipes are awful, they are rough, do not clean well and the packaging is terrible. They turned an excellent product and made this instead. I will return and do not buy again.",
