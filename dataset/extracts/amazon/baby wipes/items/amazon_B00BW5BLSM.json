Cost way less than most brands for greater quantity.CONS : Closure made of sheet of plastic with glue that eventually wears off then package no longer closes. (Bought wipes dispenser to remedy the issue) Wipes aren't aligned properly. You either have to pinch / scratch them out with nails or search far into the package to find the edge.",
