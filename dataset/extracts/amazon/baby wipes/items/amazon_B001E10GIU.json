I was going to get the Natracare intimate wipes, but when I realized how much cheaper the baby wipes are I couldn't resist getting them instead! Then after they arrived they had this nice light scent, just the right amount of wetness & feel amazing on your skin, so I decided to try them as makeup wipes. I don't usually purchase makeup wipes because I much prefer to just clean my face, but these work great for it on the days that for whatever reason I just want to wipe it off real fast. I will repurchase these over & over again. & when I have kids, I'm sure I'll buy these for them too!",

But they are pretty thin (I know this is part of being eco-friendly), which made them a little difficult to separate with one hand while also holding on to a squirming baby. Maybe if they were folded in another way this could be solved. I was glad to find wipes like these without a strong smell, so much baby stuff is heavily scented. Overall good wipes.",
