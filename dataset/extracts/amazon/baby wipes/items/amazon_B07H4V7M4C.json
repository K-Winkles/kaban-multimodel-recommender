Is this product different from the discontinued 810-count Amazon Elements Baby Wipes? Yes it is. A manufacturing defect caused accelerated oxidation and discoloration in our now-discontinued 810-count wipes. This defect does not affect our 720-count packages, which have been rigorously tested to meet our quality and safety standards. Can I use these baby wipes to clean other parts of my baby? Yes. Amazon Elements Baby Wipes are safe for cleaning your baby's hands, feet, face, and diaper area. Baby wipes should not be used to clean inside your baby's mouth, nose, ears, or eyes. What ingredients do you keep out of your baby wipes? Amazon Elements Baby Wipes do not contain dyes, parabens, phthalates, or alcohol. Can I rehydrate baby wipes that have dried out? Unfortunately, no. Our baby wipes are manufactured using pharmaceutical-grade purified water to keep them clean and effective; adding tap or bottled water might cause discoloration, odor, or even unwanted growths on the wipes.",

The recommended shelf life of Amazon Elements Baby Wipes is two years.",

We generally purchase the pampers sensitive wipes because they don\u2019t irritate my kiddo and they are wet enough to clean up messes without needing so many wipes. These, however, they are:- thick/ durable without the perfumes and additives = don\u2019t rip easily-size of wipes fit my hand well for easy wiping- you can\u2019t see through them ,so they are thick* my only complaint is that they aren\u2019t wet enough to clean up yucky full diapers and require more wipes than necessary because there isn\u2019t enough moisture in them. *",

Anyway, gave the Amazon brand my 1st try since it was a Today\u2019s Deal- and am dry satisfied w/the size, softness and it\u2019s a decent quality wipe. Not flimsy see thru or easily readable- like a dollar store brand could be, nor overly scented. Will probably repurchase w/ subscribe & save price point. Recommend.",
