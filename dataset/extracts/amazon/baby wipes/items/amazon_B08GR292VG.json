                "reviewText": "I like the product and it works well on sensitive skin ... in that regard it's perfect. However, I'm deducting two stars for the packaging which, quite simply, is terrible. The dispenser lid is a thin flexible plastic tab affair (see photo) that uses what looks to be a layer of adhesive to bind the lid to the dispenser. It's not a positive closure mechanism (e.g., not like other lids that click into place so you know its locked closed) and when the inevitable happens ... you go to pull out one wipe, get ten, then try to put nine back for the next time - it doesn't work very well because the dispenser surface is no longer flat (because of the nine clumped-together wipes) meaning that there's less area for the adhesive to bind to.The seam between wipes is virtually undetectable both visually and tactilely, leading to a lot of over-dispenses. This is not a problem unique to this product. Why, oh why, can't someone come up with a solution to this? It's a common complaint and an issue the manufacturers seem tone-deaf on.If you have your own dispenser and are transferring these wipes to it, then I would say go ahead and buy without hesitation ... but if not, be aware of the annoying usability problems you'll likely have.",
