The only logistical thing to note is that the first couple of wipes are a little tricky to pull out of the package at first and can tear easily; once you know that, it's easy to avoid ripping those first few.",

It does a good job cleaning things up and my hands remain clean, I could probably get by not washing them afterwards (but I do anyway).The package is easy to open and reseals very well, keeping the contents moist for the next emergency.I would have given 5 stars but it is not easy to remove just one from the package, there's nothing to grab, you have to pinch a tissue and often you get two for that one pinch.

While they may contain less chemicals or be healthier for the skin than mainstream commercial wipes, why not go the whole way and make a product that actually breaks down? Plus, it is easier to flush dirty wipes than to have to find a place to dispose of them.Some \"flushable\" wipes are thin and break apart in your hand. These Babyganics are the perfect thickness and durability for one use, but still flushable. They do not dry out prematurely in the package, which has a thick sturdy flap over the opening instead of a flimsy sticker. As far as I'm concerned, this is the perfect wipe (and not just for babies-- our whole family uses them).",

                "reviewText": "Those wipes are very decent. In six bags, I didn't notice any mold issues (unlike others have reported), and although they are pretty thin (all flushable wipes are), they're not so thin that you can't wipe. And unlike some others I've used, they're no irritating.Unfortunately, the pros don't overweight the ONE BIG CONS: the way the wipes are folded!!!You know how baby wipes are usually folded so that the back flap of one will be under the top flap of the next one, so that the wipe underneath start coming out as you're done pulling the one on top (like tissues)? Well, those are not folded like that; they're pack-folded on top of one another, so you have to claw at each and every single wipe to get it out. Because they're so thin, not only you don't see where the fold is, but there's every chance you'll tear half the wipe. Most of the time, I have pull a couple together and end up using double quantity.Note: Putting the wipes in a good wipe dispensers will NOT help, as the problem is not the dispensing system itself but the way the wipes are folded.I'm keep ordering them because they don't irritate my little one, but they'll be gone in favor of something more convenient as soon as I find that something.Manufacturer: Take notice! The fix is easy enough...",

                "reviewText": "LOVE these things. I had been using Charmin, Cottennelle, store brand, etc, wet wipes for years. I mean, come on... Who doesn't want to be clean after going to the bathroom. We use wet wipes on babies, but nobody ever thought of making flushable wet wipes for adults until 10-15 years so. Anyway, slowly over time, I noticed my butt was having \"issues\" after using other brands. Let's just say it was majorly inflamed, raw, bloody, etc. Gross, right? It was a horror story having to go to the bathroom. Because this happened slowly over years, I never attributed it to the wipes. I even made the most embarrassing doctors appointment to get \"it\" checked, thinking maybe cancer, or something else that was horrible. Bending over a table and haven't a doctor prod my starfish was humiliating. Even he didn't know what was wrong, and advised me to get a diaper rash cream. It wasn't until one day that I was wiping with a wet wipe (in agony, mind you) that it finally occurred to me. What if it was the wipes?!?!? The bathroom buddy that I considered a necessity?!?!? How could I get along without them!?!?! I decided to try switching to a natural version of wet wipes. After some research, I found these on Amazon, and guess what... I was right! These wipes have literally saved my sanity, and my butt. I used to dred going to the bathroom, because I knew the pain I'd have to go through associated with wiping. I honestly would take Imodium just to avoid going to the bathroom for a few days (I know that's terrible for your health, but I hated going to the bathroom that much). So when I say that these wipes are a lifesaver, I'm not exaggerating. I suffered for YEARS due to the toxic chemicals that other manufacturers put in their wipes. I can't say thank you enough to Babyganics!!!!!",

                "reviewText": "These wipes are amazing. There is no scent or sticky feeling and they are flushable. I do not have a baby, I use them for everything else; my puppy, travel wipes, standard supplies for the bathroom. They have an absorbent quality as well so it does not leave a wet streak across the surface it is wiping. These are available at Target but it's hit and miss. It is cheaper and more convenient to keep them on subscription from Amazon.",

As a side affect to this feature though, they are a bit flimsy....as in you may want to use 2sheets instead of one .",

                "reviewText": "These wipes are pretty terrible overall. It\u2019s great that they\u2019re flushable, but in an effort to be flushable the wipes are flimsy and I end up having to use way more of them to get my baby clean. In the end, I don\u2019t flush any of her wipes anyways since a) even flushable wipes can mess up your plumbing and shouldn\u2019t be flushed, and b) Most diaper changes happen on a change table and not in a bathroom. Additionally, I have found that the wipes don\u2019t stay together when pulling them out of a wipe case so I have to dig around and try to find the edge of the top wipe every single time I pull them out. At the end of the day there these wipes are more of a pain in the ass than anything.",
