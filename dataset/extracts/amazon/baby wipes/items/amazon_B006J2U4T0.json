                "reviewText": "After all of the toilet paper scare with the pandemic, I started being more cognizant of how much toilet paper we used on a weekly basis. We were using quite a bit! We decided to buy a bidet. Upon installing and using the bidet, it quickly became evident that toilet paper was not the most efficient way to dry off afterward. I bought a 12 pack of these cloths to see if these worked better. I was so impressed with them, I bought 2 more 12 packs.Upon first washing, these do shrink a little bit, so be prepared for that. For my purposes, they are still a good size. I have attached a picture of an unfolded cloth and under it a folded cloth and 2 squares of toilet paper to give you a size comparison. Both of those cloths have been washed several times. As you can see, there is no unraveling. None of the cloths I received have had any unraveling. When I use them after using my bidet, I fold the cloth into fourths and flip over to dry more. I have had no problems doing it that way and always feel nice and dry afterward.When I wash the cloths, I put them in a mesh bag and wash on normal wash with warm water in my front loading washing machine. I typically hang on wired clothes hangers to dry because I find that very easy. I put 2 cloths on each hanger. Since they are single ply, they dry very quickly. I have dried some of the cloths in the dryer and they came out fine as well.These cloths are not as absorbent as a terry washcloth or microfiber cloth would be, but they are much more absorbent than toilet paper and they don't have the bulk that a terry wash cloth or microfiber cloth would have.",

They are not as thick as the double-layer wipes I have (duh) but sometimes it is nice to have a smaller wipe for a smaller job.The stitching on one wipe came un-done the first time I washed it but this seems to be just a fluke as the others are all holding up well after several washes.I use my wipes by spraying with a spray bottle, and at first these wipes did not seem very absorbent. I would spray a wipe and the water would just pool on the surface. After many washes this problem has resolved and they now work great and soak up the water immediately.",

They're also good for little messes around the house. The terry cloth wipes are too absorbant. These have stood up wash after wash, and now I want to get rid of my old kinds and buy just these! (Believe me. I am on my 4th child and have tried lots of wipes!) These are perfect, and it's okay to use one or two more for extra messes...but normally, I only need one for a diaper change. These are also priced so well. I've never seen any other item this good at this low of a price.I have a spray bottle with water and my own wipe solution. I spray it on my little one's bottom and wipe it off with one of these wipes. They get washed with my cloth diapers. Easy!",

                "reviewText": "When I first got these I liked them a lot- they are thin and a good size, seemed like they would be very efficient at cleaning up baby's bottom. After the first wash I was very disappointed that the seams pulled at the edges and the pretty rainbow stitches were all frayed and strings everywhere. It didn't affect the use of the wipe, though, so I decided it was okay. After a week of newborn cloth diapering we decided we needed more wipes- I decided to try Osocozy brand cloth wipes and I LOVE those. They are just a hair more expensive and so worth it. If i could go back I would have ordered all Osocozy for sure. They are the same size and same thinness that's so good for cleaning bottoms- but they are SO SOFT and comfy on my baby's bottom, and have held up so much better in the washer. My baby has diaper rash right now and I won't even use the Bumkins currently because they're so much scratchier.",

                "reviewText": "These are nicer than the OsoCozy ones, IMO. The turquoise color is prettier, for one, but more importantly, the stitching doesn't get frayed and fuzzy with washing. The downside to these is that each wipe has a great big tag sewn along the edge. Still, these work, they're cute, the price was good, and these still fit in the OXO wipes carry case despite being a bit larger than the OsoCozy wipes.",

I've been waiting to take a major step in my life and that was to get rid of a very guilty pleasure of mine, and that is old growth tree toilet paper. You know, the super soft multiple ply toilet paper... It's really horrible for our environment but I couldn't bring myself to buy cheap scratchy young growth toilet paper. I can't stand the stuff, and the roll is empty so quickly.So I got rid of all of it!After looking and looking, these sounded like they were quality, absorbent, cheap and a good size. These met all my expectations and more. They wipe adult bottoms well, so they should easily clean up a child. They're soft, absorbent, wash and dry very quickly, I just keep a little cotton muslin bag on a hook on the wall. I rinse them off after use and just toss them into the bag to be laundered, they dry discretely inside the bag until I wash them in hot water and oxyclean. I keep clean ones in a cute drawstring tote that sits on my counter top. I bought 4 packs, and I will be buying more!I just love them.
