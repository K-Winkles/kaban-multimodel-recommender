Despite the name, baby wipes are useful for more than just changing diapers. They\u2019re a modern convenience that kids and adults of all ages can use to take care of spills, cool down dry skin, or help sanitize dirty or dusty surfaces. Even though dry toilet paper may be of some help with removing dry debris, pre-moistened wipes are sturdier and far better at picking up or cleaning off grime. They also come in conveniently portable packages, so you can always have a handful within easy reach. The Baby Wipes by Dynarex will help you conquer any mess.",
