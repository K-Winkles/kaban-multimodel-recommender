Because his skin is so thin, you know he\u2019s cranky when it turns red and blotchy, or he\u2019s chilly when his hands and feet are a little bluish. Skin that thin can also easily absorb harmful industrial contaminants \u2014 that\u2019s why our products don\u2019t have any! ATTITUDE Baby Wipes are made from plant-based materials and use worry-free, natural ingredients. They\u2019re also biodegradable and compostable, making them as gentle on the planet as they are on his cheeks.",
