She\u2019ll get a little pee dribble down her back leg. When this happens, I grab her and give her booty and back legs a good wipe down with these wipes. They\u2019re sturdy and don\u2019t tear apart, but are soft enough on her fur and little booty. The scent is clean, not at all overwhelming. They work well for our random non-baby/diaper needs.",

                "reviewText": "These wipes work well. Very gentle and no strong deodorant smell. It is great to have a wipe that doesn't have a baby wipe smell. The opening could be improved. I understand that the lack of a lid opening is most likely for environmental reasons and I respect a purist approach. But when you have a squirming toddler or fussy baby it is not always convenient to make sure you open them carefully to avoid tearing the opening which we found way too easy to do. We are way past the diaper year's but still find great value in having wipes handy. I will buy these again but hope they might consider improving the opening for a more successful reseal. In the meantime I will just put them in a large ziploc to compensate.",

We have literally tried every brand of wipes available from the cheapest to the most organic and premium brands. The thickness and strength of these wipes is at least twice that of anything else out there. We can regularly change a diaper with just 1 wipe but almost never needing more than 2, even for the toddler. Buying these in quantities of 600 or 1200 with subscription also makes them very affordable. it is a complete bonus that they are very good for our babies, too.",
