                "reviewText": "I recently decided to try out Dude Wipes, and honestly, I'm wondering why I didn't make the switch sooner. As someone who's always on the go, these wipes have been a total game-changer for my daily hygiene routine.Firstly, the size of each wipe is just perfect. Unlike regular wipes, they are large enough to provide a thorough and satisfying clean. This is a big plus, especially after workouts or during those hot summer days. The packaging is also really convenient \u2013 easy to pop in a gym bag or even a back pocket if needed.What really stands out for me, though, is the quality. The wipes are sturdy, yet gentle on the skin. They're infused with aloe and vitamin E, leaving a fresh and soothing feeling post-use \u2013 no irritation or dryness like some other brands. And the fact that they are 99% water and plant-based makes me feel good about using them regularly.The fragrance is another highlight. It's fresh and clean without being overpowering. I've found that it's a subtle enough scent that it doesn't clash with my cologne, which is a big plus.",

One other thing that surprised me is that they are rather delicate, they will tear easily.... have to handle the wipes carefully not to tear a hole in them. I wound up folding them in half to give them strength. Beyond all this, they did what they are supposed to do. I just returned from a rehab hospital for major back surgery and was kind of spoiled by their bathroom wipes - larger size, thicker, and very strong - can't tear those! However I must point out that the hospitals wipes were not flushable. And these ARE, which was the greatest selling point for me. I will use these up and then go shopping again and try out some other brands. These are good, but I hope to find something even better (larger, stronger, in a flushable wipe).",

                "reviewText": "I did my business, flushed what came out of me, wiped myself as clean as I usually do with my toilet paper (which is probably far cleaner than most people because I wash there every day too), and then I finished the job with just one Dude Wipe. I used that one wipe several times by using different parts of just one side of it, and I even folded it when I used up one side even though I didn't really need to use it all that much to begin with. Hey, it felt good so I didn't want to stop. I wanted to grab another after that one even though the Dude Wipe I used was still white. While I was wiping myself with it, I was thinking this must've been what it felt like when I was a baby getting my butt wiped perfectly clean for me.So yeah, after folding it and using just one side of the folded version of it, I tossed it and flushed it and seriously, that's the best I've ever felt after taking the brown clown downtown. I am using these from now on for the rest of my life!However, unlike almost everyone else, I will always use one of these to FINISH the job, as opposed to just never using toilet paper ever again. That way, I think I'll pretty much guarantee 2 things:1. No plumbing problems from flushing too many of these, even though I seriously doubt I'd ever need enough in one sitting to end up with enough in the toilet to create plumbing problems. These things are huge and one wipe can be used SEVERAL times as I described above, especially if you get most of it with toilet paper first. If you don't use toilet paper, then I think you'd need 2 or 3 at the most.2. My supply will last longer and my butt-wiping expenses will remain very low.Thank you for reading my story about me wiping my butt. This was the best butt-wiping experience I've had so far in my life, at least that I can remember. Again, I bet this is how good it felt when I was a baby getting my butt wiped clean for me.Before I end this, I have one more thing to add: prior to today's experience, I planned to only use these for those unpleasant times when dry toilet paper isn't enough. Like those times where you can start with dry toilet paper but something wet and strong is definitely required. After today's experience, I will always at finish the job with one Dude Wipe. So for me it will be just like the package says, grab ONE and wipe, dude!It took me way too long to figure out that I can just use them this way. I avoided ordering them for several months because I worried about being another customer with plumbing problems due to using these INSTEAD of toilet paper. When I finally had the idea to use them to FINISH the job, I happily ordered without any hesitation. I'm actually looking forward to the next time I have to go now thanks to these. It felt that good.",

                "reviewText": "As a person living in shared housing, cleanliness and buying shared toiletries can be a bit of a problem. These are great because each person can just buy their own and not have to worry about wasting toilet paper. They are incredibly soft and don't tear that easily. All of my friends buy them as well for their ease of use and because they clean well. Due to their size, one pack can last at most a month and it does come in a six-pack, however, it will not last 6 months guaranteed. One thing to note for sure is that you may have to flush multiple times. The most amount of wipes I have been able to flush without clogging the toilet at one time 3, thus if you need to use more, make sure to flush after every 3 wipes.",

It's a refreshing departure from overly fragrant wipes on the market. The absence of strong scents makes it suitable for individuals with sensitive skin or those who prefer a clean, neutral experience. True to its promise, DUDE Wipes are flushable, making disposal hassle-free and environmentally conscious. The wipes maintain their structural integrity during use and dissolve efficiently, minimizing the risk of plumbing issues. This feature adds a layer of convenience that sets DUDE Wipes apart from traditional alternatives. DUDE Wipes Flushable Wet Wipes Dispenser is a must-have for anyone seeking a reliable, versatile, and convenient personal hygiene solution.",
