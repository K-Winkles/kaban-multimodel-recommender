(Yeah I know dad jokes)We recently brought our twin girls home, and one of them had a bit of sensitivity to some of the wipes we tried. I found these dry wipes on Amazon, and for about $20 thought the price was reasonable.The dry wipes are a little smaller than most of the wet wipes we use, but just big enough to get the job done. The wipes themselves are both soft and very strong.The wipes are great when wet and used as a wet wipe, but also very useful when dry cleaning up your little one's mouth after spit ups. Because these are made from 100% cotton, they are very absorbent.The only problem is the price keeps going up. After I ran out of these wipes and went to buy more, I balked at the price increase. I ended up buying a bunch of medline ultrasoft wipes. After using the medline wipes, I realized how nice these Happy Bum Bum ones are. The medline ones are made from polyester and rayon, and wick up moisture instead of absorbing like the Happy Bum Bum ones.",

Only wish I would have realized it sooner!When my baby was born, the hospital gave us dry wipes to use. Confused, we brought in some wet wipes from home. We quickly realized how nice dry wipes are. We ran out of what they sent us home with, and I came across these after reading several good reviews compared to other brands, and I liked the price.I change her happily knowing my baby's completely dry when I put her barrier cream and new diaper on, preventing rashes. They're great for spills and having handy if you need to apply creams. They're good for cleaning baby's mouth out. So many uses. I keep these near all over the house.Waiting for another 50% off promo. I'm nearly out of my 3rd box since baby came home. We go through about 1box per month.",
