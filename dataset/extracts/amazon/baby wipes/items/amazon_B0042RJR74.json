                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best low-toxicity wipes, see EWG's Skin Deep website",
                "reviewText": "I like these wipes. Compared to other eco-friendly/non-toxic wipes, these are my favorite. They are very soft (unlike Tushies, which I think were discontinued anyway), thick and large (unlike Seventh Generation), have just the right amount of moisture, and the smell is very mild. Our son sometimes tries to hide dirty diapers, occasionally leading to dried poop sticking to his bottom, and these do a very good job of \"grabbing\" stuck bits so we don't have to scrub as much (sorry for that mental image, but if you change toddler diapers you're probably familiar anyway). This scrubbing issue seems to be big with most of the eco-friendly wipes out there, with Seventh Generation being the worst. We don't have to use as many thanks to how large and thick they are, and the price is decent per wipe, so they also end up being the most economical. Occasionally they do leave a bit of white fuzz, but it doesn't seem to bother either of my kids, who both have very sensitive skin.Some other reviewers have claimed these wipes contain toxic chemicals. Yes, they contain chemicals. *Everything* contains chemicals, and just because the chemicals have long names does not mean they are necessarily harmful. Before you rule out these wipes based on these reviews, check out Environmental Working Group's website on cosmetics, SkinDeep, and decide for yourself. (If you're concerned about the toxicity of chemicals in our daily lives and you've never been to this website, please go. It is a great site and EWG is a non-profit organization, not industry-sponsored. For the record, I am not affiliated with them in any way.) These get an overall 2/10 for safety (0 being totally non-toxic, 10 being the worst) so they are considered \"Low Hazard\" according to EWG. For me, this is good enough. The few wipes that get better ratings on their site are either completely unaffordable for us so I haven't even tried them (like, $0.10 per wipe), or they are torture on my poor son because we have to scrub so hard when stuff gets crusted on.",

                "reviewText": "I've tried several different wipes (amazon, pampers, huggies, honest, 7th generation, target, maybe one or two others I've blocked from memory) and these are my fav for a few reasons:1) when you pull one wipe, you get ONE wipe! Seems so basic but with so many other brands I would pull one wipe and then two, or three, or more start coming out of the package.. ugh! Now I'm trying to rip these multiple wipes apart and jam the extras back in the pack while simultaneously holding a squirmy baby with my other hand or forearm or elbow.. you get the idea - these wipes work great with one hand.2) they're the perfect texture and thickness -in my opinion- moist but not too wet, even when you get to the bottom of the pack; not too thick or too thin, I'm not worried about it ripping and getting poo on you (ahh!! ok, let's be real for a minute, once you're a parent getting poo on you is really no big deal, but still!); and they're a mostly smooth texture without being slippery (if you've used the Amazon brand wipes you know what I mean about slippery texture.. they were not my top pick).3) they have some fancy oil blend that they advertise as being the best thing to touch your baby's skin (my words, not theirs) - I don't know all about these claims but I do know that these wipes are amazing! They do not irritate my baby's skin at all, I use them according to their name - on face, hand and \"baby\" (which we all know means \"bottom\"). My kiddo has had some issues with other wipes but I wouldn't say that her skin is exceptionally sensitive. These wipes with their fancy oil blend are just great - even when the skin isn't 100% dry we have never had an issue with a rash/reaction.I've been really happy with these wipes, plus their packaging is nice and the top re-sticks easily. They're a great product and a great value. Would recommend to all caregivers tasked with wiping face, hands and babies!",

                "reviewText": "I decided to try these out because it was a good price for the amount of wipes you receive. Previously I was ordering the Amazon Basics wipes, and they are really good. These wipes came in a box of four separate wipe containers, each with 100 wipes. First of all, they don't have any texture like other brands. The Amazon Basics had little bumps, which are great for wiping or gently scrubbing. I use these on my face to remove makeup, and the lack of texture makes it more difficult to get the job done. Secondly, these are unscented, but they have a natural aroma. It isn't really great smelling, but it isn't horrible either. It's just...tolerable...that's the only word I can think of that really captures the natural scent of these wipes. Thirdly, they aren't as wet as other wipes, they're more dry. Maybe when you get further down, near the bottom, they'll become wetter. But so far, they are slightly damp, so it was like rubbing regular toilet paper on my face. I took off one star for the lack of texture and wetness/moisture on the wipes. I can't imagine people using this to wipe up a baby's bottom when they're so dry. Yes, they will work great if you turn the sink on and wet these wipes. But for a mother on the go out with her baby, I would think these would be a pain to deal with. As of now, I would buy them again in the future. I use other Babyganics products and have been pleased with the brand. If my second pack is better I will come back and update my review and give it five stars.",

I was using Water Wipes first, as they're as gentle as you can get, but they're pricey, and I was frustrated with how they came out of the package in clumps. I usually use Pampers Sensitive or Natural Care wipes, but since my baby (my 2nd) is so new, I wanted to use something better quality at first. I really like these wipes. They're so gentle and natural, but they clean very well.",
