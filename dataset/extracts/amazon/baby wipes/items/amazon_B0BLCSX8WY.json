I fluff them a few minutes in the dryer and then line dry them. The colors have not run, as some other reviews have claimed, and the shrinkage has been minimal.I keep these soaking in covered plastic tubs in solutions of either water/witch hazel/Castile soap or rubbing alcohol/aloe vera gel.They work great, and although they are not truly square as stated in the ad (they\u2019re slightly rectangular), they are a good size for hand wipes.",

They work great in our kitchen to wash dishes, clean little messes, and we use them as napkins for the kids. They are easy to wash and we throw them in with the towels for the week.",
