This is way too expensive compared to the one that had 6 in them!)Not only do they smell SO good, but I quite like the thickness. It's also wet enough, but not drenched. I'm not too fond of wipes that're completely soaked, as it makes it VERY annoying to use. I'd normally have to leave them out a bit to dry slightly\u2014but this, it's the perfect amount.It's quite good at wiping off oil from your hands without drying your skin. Overall, I highly recommend this over any other baby wipes (even from the same brand) if you want something scented. Steer clear if you are particular about smells as this one is still fairly strong.",
