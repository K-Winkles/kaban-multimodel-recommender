I read that the manufacturers have changed the formula recently and I am not alone! These wipes only have water and citric as a preservative, I guess. Happy to report these are gentle and as yet, no allergy. They are flushable too. Glad I found them. If you can get over the kiddy theme, they are just fine.",
