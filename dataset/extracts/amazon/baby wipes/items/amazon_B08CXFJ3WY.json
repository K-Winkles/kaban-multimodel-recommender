Personally I have always though that papers wipes were way to soft, and Huggies wipes were way to stiff. Though if i have to choose between those two I would pick Huggies. But these wipes from a brand I had not hear of previous to getting these are a nice mix of both.There not to soft, nor to stiff, there just right. There also longer than they are wide, which makes it very easy to get out of the pack because it always pops the next one out unlike other brands. The scent isn\u2019t strong at all either. I do have a hard time describing it, but it\u2019s almost like a grassy, earthy scent with a hint of flowers that actually smells surprisingly fresh. There definitely moist enough wi try out being completely soaked. Quite frankly I actually really like these wipes! They come out to around 3 bucks a pack, which isn\u2019t terribly expensive, but also not cheap either. But I would say that\u2019s a fair price for something biodegradable and that performs well. Personally I don\u2019t think they are to thin at all as others have stated either. I\u2019m quite likening these!",

                "reviewText": "We don\u2019t use wipes on our baby too frequently only because our newborn\u2019s skin is still too fragile and gets rashes easily. However, occasionally we\u2019ll use them if we have to. We have been using these to wipe his neck rolls to get rid of the sour milk smell. I usually don\u2019t purchase any scented wipes but in this instance I was kind of glad the wipes are scented. These are scented with essential oils so I was a little bit more accepting than if it was to be scented with chemicals. I tried it on my skin first, then used it on baby. His skin did not have any reaction or rashes after use so I decided it was ok to keep using it on him.I like these wipes knowing they won\u2019t be sitting on the landfill for 100+ years! I know these wipes are a little on the thinner side but it works for what we are using these for. If you really need a thicker wipes you can just double up. The fact that these are biodegradable just makes me really like these wipes! Why can\u2019t all wipes be like these?",

                "reviewText": "I have been trying to figure out what I would compare the scent of these wipes to. I just cannot think of it. My husband thinks they smell like a citrus fragrance. I feel like they have a cleaner type smell to them. I say that hesitantly because not in a bad way. As far as wipes go I think they are one of the more perfumed wipes that I have ever used. I wasn\u2019t sure at first how I would feel about it but I actually like the fragrance. It can even be quite helpful with a sensitive stomach like mine changing some very potent diapers.Texture wise they have some raised bumps to them which is helpful for gripping and really cleaning baby bottoms. They are also sturdy and do not rip apart in your hands. I can use one wipe comfortably without worrying about getting my hands dirty or the wipe ripping before I am ready. They are soft and very moist.To know that they are 100% biodegradable and compostable is pretty amazing to me. For something so sturdy I would not expect them to be so good for the environment. The fact that they have made a wipe that is good for the environment but also safe for baby and helpful for mom is pretty impressive.",
