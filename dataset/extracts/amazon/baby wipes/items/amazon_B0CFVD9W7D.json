                "reviewText": "These are nice wipes! One thing I noticed immediately is that the sizing is a bit smaller than average. I actually use these for cleaning up my parrots\u2019 messes or wiping down my bunny\u2019s fur. Since they are intended for delicate baby skin, the wipes are gentle enough for my exotic pets\u2019 sensitive systems, ensuring no irritation. Plus, they have ZERO SCENT, which is a huge win for me. They are slightly less moist than most wipes I\u2019ve used in the past, but nevertheless, they seem to clean effectively and easily freshen up my furry and feathered friends. I also appreciate the sustainability of bamboo \u2013 I do work on lowering my carbon footprint and cut down on using disposables but some things don\u2019t yet have an even replacement. Whether using these for babies or pets, these wipes are versatile enough to handle any mess, and they are a true asset in my house.",

                "reviewText": "These are very soft but also strong, not like Huggies or pampers wipes that rip when you\u2019re trying to pull one out of the bag. I feel like the size of the wipe runs a little smaller than the ones I usually get. They don\u2019t have a scent which is great, they\u2019re hypoallergenic and my eczema prone baby has done well with them and not having any type of reaction. The ingredients look like every other type of wipe. These are compostable, which is great as well but I\u2019m used to rolling dirty wipes into the dirty diaper and making little diaper footballs to get tossed into the trash so I don\u2019t see myself trying to use them for compost but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s lots of others who are into having a compost bin and would probably like these a lot.They do come in a 3 pack and nicely packaged together so it\u2019s a pretty presentable bag of wipes if you plan on gifting any at a baby shower these would be nice.",
