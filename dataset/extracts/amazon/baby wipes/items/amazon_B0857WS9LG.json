I've used the regular water wipes since my oldest was born (4) and love them - but the fact that these are four times the size means I can use them easily to wipe the girls down when we get into the car from an adventure without having to go through a pack. It's a fantastic design and I love the option!",

Dropped down 1 star because it says you should use all the wipes in about 14 days after opening the package. We were able to use it until 30 days after opening, but I was very careful to make sure that I was sealing the packet completely. I wish they had bigger packs!",
