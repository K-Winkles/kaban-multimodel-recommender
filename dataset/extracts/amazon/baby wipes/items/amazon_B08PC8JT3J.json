                "reviewText": "I had been purchasing a product that our local hospital uses. The sheets were super thick, but they cost around 33 cents per sheet when purchasing a case of them.I read through the reviews on the Inspire Adult Wet Wipes and decided that 6 cents per sheet was worth a try, even if more than one came out at a time, as many reviewers reported. I don't find that to be the case. Yes, they are MUCH thinner than the other brand. However, they serve the purpose and the majority of the time I get just one sheet. If a second sheet starts to pop through, I just push it back in. I would definitely recommend.For those who complained about the thinness, keep in mind that you are paying less than 1/5 the price. You shouldn't expect the same quality. These are wet wipes, not disposable bathing cloths.",

This cloth is strong, stretches out wide in one direction, very moist. The bad part is that it is folded too many times. Trying to separate the wet folds is like sweeping wet leaves after a rainfall. It also comes out in lumps of five but in order to get one out you'd have to allow air in the bag.",
