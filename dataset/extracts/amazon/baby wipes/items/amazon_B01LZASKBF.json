                "media_text": "Zero Cut. One Planted. Choosing Caboo saves trees and replants them, too. Working with the U.S. Forest service, we plant a tree for every pound of paper sold. More trees means better air, water, habitat and chance to combat climate change. We believe most people want to do better by the Earth. But where to start? We started Caboo: two brothers, a wife and a friend. Wiping out forests along with a spill or a bum just didn't make sense to us. So we figured it out, building relationships with trusted farmers, retailers and folks along the way. Ten years and two kids later, we're even more committed to making tree-free the go-to. Daily decisions like choosing Caboo do make a difference. We and the forest thank you! The paper industry clear cuts 1,000,000 acres of North American boreal forest each year. While trees may be replanted (and re-cut) the forest is gone forever. But, Trees Grow Too, Right? Yes, but the complex ecosystem that is a forest is gone forever. A forest is biodiverse. Over time, it is populated by different species of plants, animals and other living things at all stages of growth. They depend on each other, creating a complex ecosystem our climate depends on. It can't be replicated. Big Paper basically replants tree farms: only 1 or 2 species of the fastest growing trees all planted at once so they can get cut down again. This is why tree-free matters. How is Caboo a more Earth-conscious choice than recycled paper? Bamboo and Sugarcane are grasses, not hardwoods. They both grow very quickly and, after harvest, grow back just as quickly. No replanting is necessary. Unlike trees, which can take up to 30 years to grow and mature, bamboo and sugarcane grow back as quickly as in three to four months. When a tree is cut, it never grows back. In addition, bamboo\u2019s natural rhizome (root) network protects soil from erosion and retains moisture, and bamboo can grow in environments with depleted soil and little water. In fact, it actually returns nutrients to the soil; improving degraded areas. How Caboo gives back. It's not just the trees impacted. Bamboo vs. Trees Tree-Free > Reused Tree Paper",
