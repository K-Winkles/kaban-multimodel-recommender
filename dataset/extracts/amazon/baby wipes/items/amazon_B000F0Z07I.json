I like how they come two in each pack so I don\u2019t have to worry about them drying out. Each pack inside comes with two refills that each have a tab to pull up so you can just use the refill pack and seal the tab back down if needed. My toddler LOVES these!! They are very good. Definitely BUY!!! Also look for the refill pack holder, separate purchase, its so CUTE to use these with and it came with stickers!!",

                "reviewText": "I bought these to help teach my daughter to wipe herself. So far these are the best wipes I've found because a lot of the other ones are very small, these aren't huge but big enough that she folds them length wise and it's good enough. Another very nice thing is these wipes pull out of the package like they should. Almost all the other wipes I tried would pull out 1 wipe and the 2nd wouldn't come with it so you would have to dig around in the package for the edge and that was frustrating for my young daughter trying to wipe by herself so I was very happy to see these worked great. I also bought the OXO wipe dispenser so they don't dry out and it's works very nicely. I'm sure there's a lot of other dispensers that would do the same thing but I would suggest getting one to keep these in or they can dry out.",
