                "reviewText": "Overall I like this product. I have been using PrepH ones for years. These are a decent competitor and in fact win over the PH in a couple of areas.The wipes are a very decent size but they are packed way too tight in the package. They often tear or come out in multiples. Very frustrating and probably the most common complaint. Hopefully they are reading these reviews. They seem to lack the amount of Witch Hazel that PrepH has in their wipes and they don\u2019t have the same cooling effect as PrepH either. They could be more moist, and this would probably solve these differences. I wish these came in individually wrapped ones. The same brand has some individually wrapped ones but Not in the Medicated (Witch Hazel) version.I would recommend these and will probably buy again.",

                "reviewText": "Every time an adventure - You have your brand new fresh pack of Dude Wipes. Carefully, you pop the little flip lid on the pack and peel off/discard the cellophane seal. You see what appears to be the first edge of the leading sheet inside the pack, grasp between thumb and forefinger; pull ... and thennnnn:CRAP! The product is packed so tight, everything binds, and instead of just withdrawing a sheet, one ends up tearing and dragging about the first four sheets, wasting what isn't a necessarily cheap product. Once open one has to continue using caution to get the product out of the pack, lest one waste even more product. Such a buzz kill on an otherwise great product.UPDATE: I wrote to the customer email address for Dude Wipes. Here is the first response:----------------------------------Berni DUDE (DUDE Products)Sep 13, 2023, 1:24 PM CDTHi DUDE!Thank you for reaching out to us at DUDE! I'm sorry to hear that you received a bad apple pack of wipes. I would be happy to replace them for you.If you would please answer a few questions?- How many packs do you have this way? Which DUDE Wipe scent are you having issues with?- Do you still have the packs? Please provide the lot information found on the side of the pack.- What is your full name and shipping address so that we can send out your replacements right away!All the Best! ----------------------As one can see, \"Berni\" first failed to even read what I was saying (per above re packaging). I didn't need replacement product, but (on behalf of many) fixed packaging. I replied to his message as follows:--------------------------------------------Sep 13, 2023, 2:44 PM CDTI have purchased 3-packs of DUDE Wipes - Medicated Flushable Wipes - 48 Wipes - Unscented Extra-Large Adult Wet Wipes nine (9) times. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re understanding my concern. I am pointing out a defect, as reported by MANY other customers (see: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B092YDFRBX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1). The product is consistently packed to an extreme tightness making it impossible to extract, sheet-by-sheet when first opened, and the difficulty continues through the duration of the pack. That said, if you wish to send an additional three-pack to mitigate the waste caused by your packaging, I\u2019m fine with that. The panacea, however is to **fix your packaging.**The current lot # is: 201964 (a photo of pkg side/rear panel attached). Full name and shipping address below. Many thanks.Respectfully----------------------------------------------------The next response was a 'non-response:'---------------------------------------------------Berni DUDE (DUDE Products)Sep 15, 2023, 2:06 PM CDTThank you for your message DUDE! We truly care about constantly improving and value your feedback. This has been documented to pass along to the DUDES.----------------------------------------------------We can conclude that Berni and Dude Products are satisfied with their product packaging and performance and are complacent about doing anything in response to customer complaints. Furthermore, while I'm fine with the product name, I kind o' take exception to being addressed as \"DUDE,\" when I communicate a concern, only to then be blown off, and since my complaint was about packaging; not product, I guess he withdrew the offer of free replacement.Alas, I like the product; just not the packaging, and I don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. For those of us at wits-end with Dude Products crappy packaging, my solution was to find a good-quality dispenser, remove the wipes from the original packaging and dispense from the replacement. The solution works great, as the wipes are no longer packaged tightly with a draw-slot that prohibits easy withdrawal. The container I found was a bit pricy (over $20), but it will pay for itself in the long run.The dispenser is the OXO Tot Perfect Pull Wipes Dispenser at: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0771FFWPX?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details.The dispenser includes a heavy composite plate with a large slot that holds the product down, but also gives a bit so as one pulls up, it allows the top sheet (with a little finesse) to slip through. It's been a pleasure to use. I just open the Dude Wipes Pack, withdraw the wipes, place in the OXO and throw the original package away.",

                "reviewText": "Edit: added one star as I have learned that these just come out of the package differently. Once you figure out how to pull them it\u2019s no issue. Also I\u2019ve had a chance to use them side by side with Prep H wipes and the dude wipes are vastly superior. They could be a little moister but that\u2019s the only area Prep H wins.Not the worst I\u2019ve used but nowhere near the quality of the Prep H ones. The wipes are a decent size and thickness but they are packed way too tight in the package. They almost always tear or come out in twos. There doesn't appear to be much witch hazel in the wipes as they don\u2019t have the same cooling effect as prep H. In fact the wipes aren\u2019t very moist at all. These are however available which the Prep H variety hardly ever are.",
