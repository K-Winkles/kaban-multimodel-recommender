It cleans well enough and the scent smells fine without being too overwhelming.We keep the pacifier and bottle wipes in the diaper bag as it\u2019s most helpful if they drop the pacifier when we\u2019re out and about. Also great for a quick clean of the pacifier while at home.All the packs are compact to be used on the go if needed, but you\u2019ll use some more than others based on the situation. They are great quality as expected from Dr. Brown\u2019s products. Overall, I would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "The wipes are pretty decent. The scented ones are lightly scented so nothing too overpowering and Dr. Brown's is a trusted name so the wipes are relatively chemical free with naturally derived ingredients. I appreciate that they are great for sensitive skin as well.Now, the wipes feel like wipes, its rather interesting that they are split up into specific uses. I feel they're the same wipes, just packaged and marketed different for various uses. Seems a bit overboard and unnecessary. Nevertheless, I've been using the pacifier wipes as table wipes and hand wipes since the little one doesn't use bottles or pacifiers anymore. I did find the most usage in the nose and face wipes. Its great to use especially now during colder weather when the little guy has dribbles down the nose. The packaging is small and convenient to take out on the go and throwing in the diaper bag.Decent product but I do wish they sell them single pack because for older toddlers, the pacifier and bottle wipes doesn't seem that useful.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great set of wipes. The face wipes contain calendula which is super helpful with baby and toddler's sensitive skin. The tooth wipes are super helpful when littles are cutting their first teeth and need to begin getting used to brushing their teeth. The pacifer and bottle(or cup) wipes are great when you've got a little one that likes to throw things on the ground or drops things a ton. The face wipes and teeth wipes are only a 30 pack, not a 40 pack like the pacifer and bottle wipes.NOTE: Xylitol, the natural cleaning agent in the teeth wipes and pacifier and bottle wipes is HIGHLY toxic to dogs. It's has many great benefits and uses for humans but per the VCA: xylitol is extremely toxic to dogs. Even small amounts of xylitol can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), seizures, liver failure, or even death in dogs. If you have a dog that gets into trash or likes to chew things, especially since the teeth wipes are grape flavor, you may want to avoid using in your home.",

                "reviewText": "I love the variety of this set as I use all three. The pacifier and bottle wipes are great to keep in our diaper bag when we are out. Especially for dropped pacifiers, which happens quite a bit. The nose and face wipes work well, especially when my daughter wakes up with a dried drool after a good night's sleep. But my favorite of the wipes are the tooth and gum wipes - and my daughter's as well! I was using a different brand of these and those haven't been available for purchase for a while. So I was happy to see these. She seems to like these even more than the other brand. We brush her teeth daily, but she will always ask for one especially when she is teething, which seems to calm her a bit. I noticed that you can purchase these on Amazon individually, which I plan to do once we run out. Great value set!",
