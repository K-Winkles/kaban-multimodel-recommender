They're cheaper than typical brand-name cleaning wipes, yet they do just as good a job on everything (except actual disinfecting). We also use them for personal/beauty wipes, for the same reason - they work fine and are FAR cheaper. Removing makeup/facial cleansing, freshening up, cooling off sweaty brows on hot summer days, wiping down sticky hands/faces ... extremely versatile.Normally I just buy whatever is on sale, but I was putting in a big Amazon order last week and added these in since we needed them. I am HOOKED! First of all, they SMELL. SO. GOOD. I can't even describe it, except that it's a fresh, sweet scent. If food smelled this good we'd be in trouble. Yet it's not overwhelming - just a ghost of it hovers around the skin after use.They also have castor oil in them, which is one of my most beloved go-to ingredients for everything. Because of the castor oil, the skin doesn't come out dry or irritated after use. The wipes just glide across, and skin feels like it's been cleansed and moisturized/lotioned without needing a second step. And did I mention it smells great?I highly recommend these. As a part-time esthetician, I teach simplicity in routines: find the most uncomplicated system, with the least (and least complex) products, that will work for you. I've never used big collections of products, just a simple basic cleanser followed with moisturizer (for me almost always one or two EOs with a coconut oil base, which I mix myself based on what mood my skin is in). These wipes are a fantastic way to remove makeup completely and/or cleanse your face. I'll be 50 in October, and my skin hasn't changed substantially in the past 10-15 years, so it must be working to some extent!",

                "reviewText": "First and foremost, one of the standout features of Pampers Multi Use Baby Wipes is its gentle, fragrance-free formula. This aspect is particularly appealing for parents who prioritize minimizing exposure to potential irritants for their little ones. The mild scent, or rather the absence thereof, is a definite plus, especially for babies with sensitive skin or those prone to allergies. It provides peace of mind, knowing that the wipes are less likely to cause any adverse reactions.However, the experience of using these wipes is not without its nuances. One notable observation is the thinness of the wipes. While they effectively serve their purpose in terms of cleanliness, their thinness can sometimes lead to challenges during use. The tendency for the wipes to stick together can be a minor inconvenience, especially when trying to extract them quickly during diaper changes or other baby care tasks. This issue could potentially be addressed with slight improvements in the manufacturing process to enhance the structural integrity of the wipes.That being said, despite the thinness and occasional sticking together of the wipes, their overall performance remains satisfactory. They effectively clean and soothe delicate skin without causing irritation, which is paramount in any baby care product. Additionally, the packaging is convenient and user-friendly, featuring a resealable flap that helps maintain moisture and freshness.In conclusion, Pampers Multi Use Baby Wipes, Fragrance-Free, presents itself as a reliable option for parents seeking a gentle and fragrance-free solution for their baby's daily care needs. While the thinness and occasional sticking together of the wipes may pose minor inconveniences, the product's cleaning efficacy and skin-friendly formula outweigh these drawbacks. With a few refinements, such as enhancing the thickness and texture of the wipes, Pampers could further solidify its position as a trusted name in baby care essentials. Overall, I would recommend these wipes to parents looking for a gentle and fragrance-free option for their little one's hygiene routine.",
