Nicely scented, and not super thick. Made well, with plenty of moisture. They do not rip or tear easily, or start to get fuzzy in the midst of using. That's something I didn't like with other wipes that I used for wiping my face down. Other brands fuzz up. These are just really good for the money.",

I love the scent, they are packed in each individual package that when you go to pull one out, only one comes out instead of 8, lol! My granndaughters both have sensitive skin, but they have had no skin issues with this brand. I also like that they don't make their skin feel sticky or leave any type of residue when they dry.

The alcohol-free wipe is the only thing we can use that she doesn't cry when changing her diaper during those times. It's been a game- changer for sure!",
