Designed for cushiony softness and durability, Huggies baby wet wipes don\u2019t easily break down after flushing. Please don\u2019t flush baby wipes, and instead use the trash bin for your wipes and diapers.",

Thick enough so they won\u2019t break and easy on hand deployment. It has a plastic cover that snaps over so they remain moist. And moist they are. The scent is vaguely reminiscent of cocoa butter but by no means over powering or cloying. Very sturdy for almost all tasks. Gentle on skin. The packs are a bit bulkier than you might be used to but I have them about the house. It would be a bit unwieldy for the average purse. Definitely a good buy",
