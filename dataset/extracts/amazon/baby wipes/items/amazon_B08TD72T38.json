Homeopathy, or homeopathic medicine, is an entire medical system that began in Europe and has been practiced in the United States from the early 19th century. 1). LIKE CURES LIKE- the concept of \"like cures like\" dates even farther back, and may have been suggested by Hippocrates around 400 BC when he prescribed a small dose of mandrake root to treat mania, knowing it produces mania in much larger doses. Essentially, a substance that produces a certain set of symptoms in a healthy person can cure a sick person experiencing those same symptoms.2). MINIMUM DOSE = EFFECTIVENESS & SAFETY - homeopathic medicine is believed to be more effective when its active ingredient is diluted. In fact, homeopathic medicine gains increased effectiveness with each additional dilution-succussion step. As a result, the safety profile of the medicine increases with increased dilution, which is of utmost importance when dealing with a children's range.",
