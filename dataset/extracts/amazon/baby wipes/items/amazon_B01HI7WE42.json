                "reviewText": "These came in handy for travel. Our little one,2.5 months old, tends to spill or spit up a little during feeding and these helped clean her up. She's also a bit hot in nature so wiping her between baths during the day is good. It is very soft and large in size. I've used it myself just to see and it was nice. The scent is very very very strong for us. Wish the scent was lighter, much much lighter. We're not able to use this on baby's face, neck, hair or hands. We just used on her body, legs and feet. I only used on arm and underarm. If you have sensitive skin, like us, the scent may be bothersome.",
