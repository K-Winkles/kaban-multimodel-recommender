                "reviewText": "My daughter has extremely sensitive skin so we\u2019v been using cloth diapers for over a year but cloth wipes didn\u2019t work very well for us so I\u2019ve been searching for natural wet wipes for so long. I literally tried all the natural brands out there and none of them were good enough. I don\u2019t like the ingredients, materials (too thin or hard to pull, etc.), and most importantly it would give her rash every time.When I was going to give up and go back to cloth wipes, I finally found Nikki\u2019s. I didn\u2019t like the strong smell at first but it\u2019s actually quite nice now that i\u2019m used to it. The material is soft, tough, perfect length, and it\u2019s easy to take individual wipe out of the bag. It\u2019s so gentle on baby\u2019s sensitive area it never gave her a rash!!!! It\u2019s that perfect wipes I\u2019ve been looking for. I love how each ingredient is explained so people can understand more easily. Highly recommend, it\u2019s simply the best on the market!",

                "reviewText": "These are SO soft! It feels moisturizing and soothing like a light lotion wipe. Doesn\u2019t leave a film feel or any artificial leftovers. I can wipe the same area several times and not irritate my sons skin. He\u2019s actually been letting me wipe his face more when he realizes it\u2019s not the other wipes. I\u2019ve tried every sensitive skin, baby wipe under the planet for myself and they all give me a scraped/burn-like filmy feel for 10-30 min after. Makes me think babies hate their face and diaper changes after a certain point because of that irritation I feel too..? Also, my sons had the same rashes pop up for several months and never fully go away. I use every high-end oil, diaper rash cream, let my son air out with nothing on and it would go down but never fully gone. All I\u2019ve done is change to these wipes and his rashes cleared up completely and almost immediately! I\u2019ve seen some reviews about the smell. The smell is light and okay. Smells similar to a jar of coconut oil.. kind of like my jars I bring for tanning that sit in the sun for a while. Not coconuty though. I don\u2019t smell unless put up to my face. Either way, they work so well! And they distribute wipes perfectly, no tangles and pulling out 5 wipes with 1.Update: I\u2019ve been using these a year now and I only seemed to have one batch that had that \u201ccoconut jar smell\u201d. None have smelled since, not that it bothered me but everyone is different. They\u2019re still my go-to choice especially since coconut oil and honey are both very powerful cleansing and healing substances. So I love that these have actual benefits that do work after use.",

                "reviewText": "These wipes are strong and durable. They have a light scent. Most importantly, they are anti bacterial, gentle, etc. in fact, they are a good substitute to keep in the car to wipe your hands instead of harsh chemical hand sanitizer. Get rid of your make up wipes too. Always use these types of items in moderation-save the planet and dispose of them appropriately - but if you use sanitizer and have skin issues-consider this product. FYI-I do not have kids but these wipes are versatile.",

                "reviewText": "Niki's Natural Baby Wipes are the best baby wipe product my wife and I have ever seen on the market and we cannot recommend this product highly enough. Our 14mth old daughter (second born) struggled constantly with terrible nappy rash and frequent UTI's/bladder infections and were concerned about what was causing the issues - we wondered if it was the wipes that we were using (a \"natural\" wipe). We found Nikis Natural wipes on line through Amazon and having read the information we decided to order the wipes. We saw an immediate difference, she has had nappy rash once and no UTI/Bladder infections! However when she started daycare, they commenced using the traditional wipes and not long thereafter the rash and infections started again. We have provided the daycare with Nikis Natural wipes and again the issues have gone! As Nikis Natural Wipes are completely toxin free, and have manuka honey as an active ingredient they have changed our daughters life for the better. And they smell and feel great, my wife has started using them for makeup remover as well. Again I cannot recommend this product highly enough - it is a must have for any young family.",
