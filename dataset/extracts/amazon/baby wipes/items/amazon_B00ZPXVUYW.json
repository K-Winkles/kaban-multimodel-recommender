                "reviewText": "I recently started using Balm Baby Juice Baby Wipe Concentrate, and I\u2019m absolutely thrilled with this product. It ticks all the boxes for what I look for in a baby wipe solution \u2013 convenience, great value for money, a pleasant scent, skin-friendly, and ease of use.First and foremost, the convenience factor is a standout feature.

This not only saves me money but also helps reduce waste, which is a win-win for both my wallet and the environment.The cost-effectiveness of this product is hard to beat. A little goes a long way, and the concentrate bottle lasts a surprisingly long time, making it a fantastic value for the money.The scent of the Balm Baby Juice is delightful. It\u2019s not overpowering, yet it leaves a fresh, clean fragrance on my baby\u2019s skin. I appreciate that it\u2019s not loaded with artificial perfumes but still manages to make each diaper change a pleasant experience.One of the most significant benefits is how gentle this product is on my baby\u2019s skin. It leaves the skin feeling soft, moisturized, and free from irritation. I\u2019ve noticed a considerable improvement in my baby\u2019s skin health since using these wipes.Lastly, the ease of use is worth mentioning. Mixing up a batch of baby wipes is a breeze with the provided instructions, and it\u2019s a quick process. Plus, the product doesn\u2019t leave any residue on the wipes, ensuring a clean and comfortable diaper change every time.In summary, Balm Baby Juice Baby Wipe Concentrate is a game-changer for parents seeking a cost-effective, skin-friendly, and convenient solution for baby wipes. It\u2019s an outstanding product that delivers on its promises and has become a staple in my baby care routine.

From wiping faces, to runny noses, to ear gunk, to messy hands/knees/bums, to even wiping down the changing table or a restaurant table...these suckers do it all! And the reason I love mine so much are 100% bc of juice those wipes. It smells good and it cleans so well but is super gentle on skin. I've used it with different brands of wipes (my fave are the more washcloth-like ones) and I use the max amount of water on the instructions with the solution. One batch over a stack of wipes fills my ubbi wipe holder and lasts me a week. The bottle lasts me months as you only need a tiny bit per batch. Make sure you mix your solution and water before pouring over folded wipes in your wipes holder. You won't regret this stuff!",

I still have almost a fourth of the bottle left so it has lasted almost 2 months! Highly recommend! The fragrance is citrusy (made with all natural ingredients) so it smells great and it\u2019s perfect for super sensitive skinned babies (my son broke out with huggies wipes and we gifted our box of those to a fellow new parent that used them) I bought a spray bottle and keep my mixed solution in that(good for 3 pack of wipes approx) and open and pour the mix directly into the reusable wipe cases I have and voila!

Also to note- I have insane sensitive skin and this doesn\u2019t irritate my skin at ALL. I even made a tiny to-go spray bottle for my purse\u2026so when I\u2019m out and about running errands I am able to freshen up!I would give this a 5/5 if the scent was better! It\u2019s not that the scent is bad- it\u2019s a nice clean scent- but I don\u2019t LOVE it. On the other hand\u2026if it had more of a perfume scent it would probably irritate my skin.I forgot to mention: it totally comes with a tiny little funnel so it\u2019s very easy to use to fill the tiniest of bottles! The funnel was the icing on the cake!",

                "reviewText": "I went the first 4 years of my cloth diaper journey (2 1/2 of those years cloth diapering two kids, 6 months cloth diapering 3 kids at the same time, somebody potty train, PLEASE!) before I tried this. I shouldn't have waited so long. First I tried pre-wetting wipes and have them in a wipes container ready to be used. But in only a few hours they didn't smell awesome, and forget using them the next day. Then I went to only wetting wipes as we needed them. Kept them fresh, just plain water, could make them warm which was nice, but it was a pain in the butt since the changing table isn't near a sink. Did that for several years. Then tried wipe solution cubes/wafers that you dissolve in water. They worked well once dissolved, but had to use near boiling water to get them to dissolve, not great when you need a wipe RIGHT NOW. Then I saw this liquid. I was skeptical because it cost more than the ones you dissolve. But it takes such a small amount for so many wipes that it has lasted over 2 months of cloth diapering 3 kids and I still have half a bottle. I use 1 tsp for 24 wipes. SMells good, keeps them fresh, I like that there's some additional cleaning power for the dirty jobs.",
