I have used Medline wash clothes when I was in hospital last for a minor incident for DKA. Not fun. Though these wipes are somewhat thin but that is fine because helps them flush easy. They do work great!!! Comes in a nice box that snaps open and closed. The wipe package has a nice string resealed pice of tape similar to Oreo cookie package. The scent is very nice and pleasant. I would buy again hopefully u can order just a package replacement to save a plastic box. You can use several together for a stronger swipe or wipe depending where ur at. Well hope that helps some of you. Also it\u2019s a cheaper option to those medline wash clothes they are thicker but honestly for $10 these work fine for me. Also feel refreshing on your face, behind your ears n elsewhere. For durability I put five stars they are not sturdy bec they are flushable but they work awesome and are great for in between showers.",

It didn\u2019t bother my skin, had a clean smell and would be a great price if it didn\u2019t take so many. Oh, they don\u2019t dry out bc the lid secures well.",
