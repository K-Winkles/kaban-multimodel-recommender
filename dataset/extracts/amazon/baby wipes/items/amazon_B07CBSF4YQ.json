                "reviewText": "I bought this with the intention of using it on my newborn, but I have made a complete switch from any other insect spray to this for my entire family. Not only does it smell amazing, but it doesn't feel disgusting on my skin. It doesn't contain harm chemicals like deet which makes my mama heart happy and the spray bottle ensures you spray with intention unlike the bigger wider sprayers that waste 1/4 of the product.",
