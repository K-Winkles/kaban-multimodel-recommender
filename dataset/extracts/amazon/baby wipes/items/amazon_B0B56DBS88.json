Other wipes: burn, difficult to wipe, pain...all the negatives reactions. Not so this one!!! Able to tolerate the pain with ease and the fissure healed fast. Wish that they make a bigger bulk for subscriptions, we will see!-----I'm a guy who use baby wipes and I have tried different brands without success until I discovered this brand. It works perfectly, I read some people who mentioned how it feels like lotion, oily....in negative way BUT not for me, it is exactly what I need. I prefer wet/lotion-y that provides \"glide\" feeling unlike \"water\" wipes. \"Water\" wipes are great for cleaning up hands, etc and definitely not for the hole. For years I used 7th Generation until they changed the wipe texture and formula- less \"lotion\" feeling and it causes burning/rash to my great disappointment. Other brands- thought I found the \"one\" and decided to keep it yet it does not have this \"lotion\"/glide feeling (Dudewipe). It does not cause burning or rash so that is a pro for this brand. The Babycozy- I tested it for weeks and no any negative symptoms and it provides great feeling. Babycozy- please keep the way it is!",

They are truly the best wipes I have used and despite being expensive, when I went back to the cheaper wipes I immediately noticed the difference and started back on these again. You can\u2019t go back to lower quality after these.What makes them great is that they\u2019re not super wet but they have moisture every time, and you can use a lot less of them to get the job done. They are thicker than other brands. They come out of the package a few at a time but you cna shove the extra back in and they don\u2019t dry out.I also trust these ingredients on my baby\u2019s face more than other brands. Baby doesn\u2019t have a diaper rash when I have to clean her extra times due to the glycerin and oil balance in these. They have no scent added, just a very mild scent from the ingredients.",
