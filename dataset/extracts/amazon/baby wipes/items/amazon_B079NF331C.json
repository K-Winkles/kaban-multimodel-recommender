When my daughter has a BM, it would take 3ish disposable wipes to get clean and it felt like the disposable wipes just smeared it around. With these reusable wipes, we need one... maybe two if it\u2019s a disaster.I use a spray (made from Baby Bits cubes) on then use these wipes to wipe off.If a stain remains after wash, I let them sit outside for a sun bleach. I\u2019ve been using them for about 3 months now and overall, they still look pretty clean.We still have disposables around as a backup and for travel because i haven\u2019t figured that out yet but I hate to use them because of the residue, waste, and chemicals.",
