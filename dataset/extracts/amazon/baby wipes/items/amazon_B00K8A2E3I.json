                "reviewText": "Wow\u2014I just popped in to amazon to order more of these and was curious why only 3.5 stars. I guess a lot of people have been getting a product that wasn\u2019t stored properly or something. We have had these on our subscribe & save for 5.5 years\u2014since my first child was born. I\u2019m very wary of chemicals in products\u2014especially those I use on my children. I tried other wipes over the years but always came back to these. To us, they are the perfect thickness, and we use them for just about everything\u2014cleaning hands & face, in a pinch: high chair tray, tabletops, countertops, and of course, diapering. We keep one at the changing table, one in the bathroom (they\u2019re not flushable but my 5YO still asks for them!), one in our diaper bag, one in any bag we take anywhere with the kids, one in each car... I often joke I will be subscribing to this item for the rest of my life\u2014we have so many uses for these! I\u2019m sensitive to smell and have never noticed anything offensive about the way these smell... A few years ago, these were in low supply for some reason and we had to switch temporarily...we were so bummed by competitor offerings (even my kids noticed), I called Babyganics to ask what was up\u2014just a manufacturing delay. (Whew!) In a perfect world, I would have made my own water wipes, but as a busy working mama of 2, that was never in the cards. If I had to find a complaint about these: the price fluctuates substantially on Amazon. Other than that\u2014to our family\u2014these are practically perfect in every way. \ud83d\ude09",

                "reviewText": "These start out a little scary because they sort of look like wet dryer sheets. You can imagine wiping a baby's mess with a dryer sheet might be a bit frightening. But lo and behold they've never ripped and my hands have stayed free of baby poo. We use these on both my 2 year old and 3 month old and they work wonderfully. They stay wet enough to wipe even the driest mess (you know what I'm talking about). The best part is we don't have a wipe dispenser and have accidentally opened about 6 packages. We have one in the car, in the diaper bag and on the changing table. The packages seal up perfectly! You never reach for a wipe and have to pull out the first three to find a wet one because the adhesive top sticks well enough to retain all the moisture. We bought these because the ingredients appear to be the best for baby's skin, and so far we've had no redness or rashes. I am happy subscribed to receive these monthly.",

The only downside is that they dont have the plastic flip top so you have to rely on the tape closure to keep the wipes moist and fresh.",
