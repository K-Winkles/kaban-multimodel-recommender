                "reviewText": "Decent quality product yet smaller sized wipes than other companies we've used. (The only reason I marked 4 stars vs 5.) The wipes do have a slight texture to them allowing for easier removal of \"sticky\" situations. They are also a bit thinner than others which does not seem to affect performance in any way. No scent which is perfect for our sensitive allergy family. They are tough and I have yet to have any tear apart. We use wipes for potty clean up, camping, you name it. These are great and I hope they really are bio so we can do our part protecting our Earth.",

                "reviewText": "The wipes are thin but strong. Being thin they take up less space, packs are smaller. And they are strong enough that they don't break during use. They are large enough to be effective for clean ups. They are moist enough to work without too much moisture that would result in drips. And they are easy on the environment. The package does not say if they are flushable or not. I do not flush them and would not even if they are quickly biodegradable.",

                "reviewText": "I researched biodegradable/compostable wipes & this brand is one of the few legitimate ones I could find. They do not have a scent & are thinner than most disposable wipes, but that's a fair trade off for a truly green product. These work well, stay moist, & are affordable. I'm almost through my first box & will be repurchasing soon.",

                "reviewText": "I'm really enjoying these wipes so far. They are soft, clean well and I love that they are biodegradable and don't have any \"crappy\" ingredients. They also have a pleasant scent, even though they're unscented - nothing perfume-y, just not the typical, somewhat unpleasant, \"unscented\" smell that other products give off. Very comfortable to use and, lastly, each wipe comes out of the package easily bringing the top of the next wipe with it, which I really appreciate! With so many other brands, I have to dig for the next wipe and tend to pull out half the package at once, which is annoying. These are great all-around!",
