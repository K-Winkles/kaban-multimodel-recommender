                "reviewText": "These are such a great product. Sure, they're just squares of cloth - but they're well made, using soft and absorbent materials, stitched well, and include an actually usable storage box. We use these alongside the cloth diapers for our baby girl, born in October. They work so much better than the disposable variety, and they're far nicer on baby's skin. They're bigger than I had expected as well, performing double duty as a burp cloth, wash rag, you name it. If you're using cloth diapers, simply throw them in your wet bag and wash with the rest in a good detergent formulated to disinfect and clean well, and you have a system that will outlast most of your other baby products.Pro tip - keep a spray bottle with the re-usable storage container. then you can store them dry and clean, and give them a couple sprays prior to use. It's no more trouble than the disposables while being an eco-friendly alternative that's easy on your little one. One of those simple things that makes life way easier for new parents.",

                "reviewText": "Highly recommend!! Super soft and reusable. They wash up 100% clean white every time. These are much more durable, soft, and safe compared to pre-packaged wipes. The are larger and your finger will never poke through like disposables! We use a spray bottle with water and wet them before changing. Wonderful addition to a fully cloth diaper decision. With these soft cotton wipes and cloth diapering, we estimate that we will save $3,000 over our babies diapering lifetime and not send thousands of diapers and wipes to the landfill which do not biodegrade. The holder for these and way that you fold them makes them such a joy to use and clean baby much better than disposable wipes. Plus they are 100% pure because you use only water while disposable wipes all have some amount of toxic chemicals. Avoid scented wipes at all costs if you care about your babies long-term health. We can\u2019t recommend this product enough!!!!",

                "reviewText": "For the fact this includes not only 54 baby wipes, PLUS the wipe container itself and a little mesh bag, this can't be beat! I compared prices of other flannel wipes and honestly they were more expensive for less wipes and no container/bag.These are flannel, so don't expect hyper \"baby soft\" - I mean they're soft, but moreso sturdy and slightly thinner, with the feeling that they're going to hold up for a LOT of washes which is just what I was looking for. I've been using them for over a month and they've been working great! I just fold them as the video says, spray each one a couple times with my baby wipe solution, use them, and toss them in the laundry! Easy to clean and my baby's bottom is happy for using the natural solution :)",
