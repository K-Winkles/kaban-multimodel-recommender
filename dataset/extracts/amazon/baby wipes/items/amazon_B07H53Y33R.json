Is this product different from the discontinued 810-count Amazon Elements Baby Wipes? Yes it is. A manufacturing defect caused accelerated oxidation and discoloration in our now-discontinued 810-count wipes. This defect does not affect our 720-count packages, which have been rigorously tested to meet our quality and safety standards. Can I use these baby wipes to clean other parts of my baby? Yes. Amazon Elements Baby Wipes are safe for cleaning your baby's hands, feet, face, and diaper area. Baby wipes should not be used to clean inside your baby's mouth, nose, ears, or eyes. What ingredients do you keep out of your baby wipes? Amazon Elements Baby Wipes do not contain dyes, parabens, phthalates, or alcohol. Can I rehydrate baby wipes that have dried out? Unfortunately, no. Our baby wipes are manufactured using pharmaceutical-grade purified water to keep them clean and effective; adding tap or bottled water might cause discoloration, odor, or even unwanted growths on the wipes.",

The recommended shelf life of Amazon Elements Baby Wipes is two years.",

                "reviewText": "Loved this product for its quality. It is definitely a premium one. Works for what it is designed for. Multi-purpose and great for babies. However, we felt the wipes could have been a little large in dimensions than the current ones that we get from the supermarket.My 2 cents below:Pros:- Smell is amazing and loved it- It has nice ingredients- Very good quality tissues and in the premium category one- Very soft & great for daily use on infant babies- No chemical or whitening agents are used in manufacturing these hence non-toxic and safe for baby- Very reasonably priced for the bulk packCons:- I wish it had a larger dimension",

                "reviewText": "Amazon really made these baby wipes with quality and value in mind. They increased the size of packs, so you get 9 90 packs instead of 8 for the same price. The wipes have the aroma of cucumber and aloe, that hides the smell of #2s. The fragrance might irritate sensitive skin, so settle with the purple pack for sensitive skin. The texture of the wipe is delicate and soft as well. Each individual package also has a lid to keep the baby wipes nice and moist with a little snap sound. Overall, there's no other baby wipes that top these!",
