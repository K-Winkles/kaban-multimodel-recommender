It's way larger than the wipes inside now. And I know this is nit picking, but the packaging also used to have a matt black ink that looked higher quality and less like children's wipes... Lol. But yea they should definitely switch back to their old packager/producer.",

These wipes help smooth and cool the most delicate area of your body. Price is good and packaging makes it less baby like (they are essentially baby wipes for big babies). The wipe itself is big enough and not so moist it makes a mess. Overall I feel fresh and clean and am happy with product. Certainly recommend for all sexes, not just dudes.",
