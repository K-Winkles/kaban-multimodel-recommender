So I bought it, but come to find out it's just a liquid with no cleansing properties at all. It's strictly for moisturizing dry skin for babies, bug bites and the lot.Not sure that its going to be safe for what I need. Totally neutral on this product, as I wasn't expecting anything from any body when I make a mistake, as I did here. The company out of the blue refunded my cost's associated with the order which surprised me, as it wasn't their mistake but mine.Outstanding Customer service like this is refreshing, and completely surprised me when it happened.I will donate the product to the local food bank in hopes it can find a home with someone with a small child that can benefit from this product",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Soothes skin (not a cleanser). Lightly fragranced; leaves non-oily aloe, glycerin \"film\" on skin",
                "reviewText": "I use witch hazel for many different things, including as a facial toner and on my hands when they get an itchy rash. Without thinking, the first thing I did with this bottle was to put it all over my face. I was, to put it mildly, surprised when it left a bit of a film (not greasy or oily but not what I'd expected). That was my fault as I had not read the label, which clearly states that it is a \"soothing solution\" to be used for diaper rash, sunburn, chapped face, chicken pox, bug bites and more.Off and on, I have an itchy, dry rash on my hands (reaction to whatever is in our water), which only stings when any type of lotion, no matter how specialized for dry or itchy skin is used. I put some of this on and it did not sting. It also greatly diminished (and sometimes eliminated) the itching and drying.So although I can't use it on my face, as I thought I could, I CAN use it as a soothing lotion for abrasions; itchy dry patches; stings and the like.It comes in an 8-ounce size that although not small, is easy enough to carry around.I am highly allergic and super sensitive to fragrance. However the light fragrance on this is neither irritating on skin nor is it annoyingly odiforous.The residue that it leaves on your skin is not greasy and once it dries, it will not rub off on material.I like that this product seems to be free of a lot of skin-irritating ingredient.It has one of those little push tops, which means you can use one hand to open and dispense it.Overall, very good product.",
