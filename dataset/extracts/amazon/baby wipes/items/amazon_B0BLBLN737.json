Designed for cushiony softness and durability, Huggies baby wet wipes don\u2019t easily break down after flushing. Please don\u2019t flush baby wipes, and instead use the trash bin for your wipes and diapers.",

                "reviewText": "I have tried so many wipes over the past year in a half and Huggies are definitely my favorite! I have loved the Natural Care line in the refreshing and fragrance free, but I think these new calm wipes have moved into first place! They are nice and thick and have a good amount of moisture to them, but not overly saturated where it leaves my daughters skin wet. Do a great job of cleaning and not smearing anything, if you know you know. These are fragrance free and don't smell chemically how some fragrance-free wipes smell. I also love the updated packaging to the push button pack. The wipes come out even better now! and I of course love the new design to the packaging, SO cute. Huggies will forever be my go-to for diapers and wipes!",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve tried a few brands and there are some that fall apart, super fragrant or leave the fuzzies behind on little ones bottom. But this one doesn\u2019t do any of those and is nice and thick. I can pull it out of the package without ripping it and it\u2019s soft for wiping. AND big bonus, it\u2019s recommended by the national eczema association. It\u2019s great for sensitive skin. I can use it on her hands too and not worry she\u2019s eating some nasty scented stuff. Licking your fingers after using a scented wipes is not fun. Trust me. They\u2019re spendy if you buy them in the smaller packages so buy the big box to save some money and trips. Get these they\u2019re awesome",
