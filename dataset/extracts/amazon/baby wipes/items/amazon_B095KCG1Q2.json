                "reviewText": "These Amazon branded flushable wipes are just okay. I use a flushable white every time I go, and have this tested a handful of options. These Amazon wipes do not come out of the package nicely. Often two will come out at the same time or they will get stuck. It also does not have a very substantial closing and sealing mechanism on the package; it's more or less sticky tape without any hard back. They are difficult to close fully to prevent from drying out. These Amazon wipes are also not particularly durable, it can be a bit precarious if you wipe with too much pressure. They aren't wimpy wipes, just okay.If you have a Costco membership I would recommend the Kirkland branded wipes if you are looking for a similar product that is more user friendly. The Kirkland packages close nicer and have a hard plastic latch and seal. They are roughly the same size and durability but they will come out of the package one at a time and not dry out.If you are looking for a \"premium\" flushable butt wipe experience, I would say Dude wipes are the best. They are larger and more durable. They don't produce lint if you need to wipe a bit aggressively.And they also have a plastic latch that typically works well, though I have had it fail before. Just came right off. Couldn't close them. Far in-between occurrences with that complaint though. However, I think the size of Dude wipes and the price is a little bit overboard. That said you can find them on Amazon on sale throughout the year.Happy wiping folks.",

                "reviewText": "BYE-BYE Costco brand and Cottonelle! These have a VERY light clean scent. I appreciate that it's not over powering. What I like most about these is that when you pull a tissue out only ONE comes out. Im so sick of these other brands pulling one out and the rest of the pack comes with it!. These are on the same price point as the other brands without the hassle of having to go to the store. Even better if you add it to a subscription.",
