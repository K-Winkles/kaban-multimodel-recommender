                "reviewText": "I've tried so many 'natural' and 'water' wipes, but these are hands down the best. They are the only wipes that are truly effective at cleaning up messes off the wood floor and are gentle enough to use as makeup wipes and daily hand wipes. These actually check off every box for what I needed: not sticky at all, minimal ingredients, no harsh chemicals, no greasy oils, no strong fragrance, they are compostable, and interestingly they clean up stains and spills instantly with no extra scrubbing. I have cockatiels and often have to clean up their \"poop\" on the floor on their perches, sometimes dried poop. These wipes clean it up instantly with no extra effort. It makes sense that they would be great baby wipes being the perfect combo of being super effective yet ultra gentle. They are not big in size, but not too small either. For my needs they are a perfect size. I hope they never stop making these.",

                "reviewText": "Bamboo has been embraced by manufacturers and consumers eager for eco-friendly products. This plant is perfectly sustainable as it regenerates after being cut back. It's amazing what a wide range of products bamboo can be made into - tableware, packaging, kitchen utensils and wipes like these.In the relatively quick move towards plastc-free wipes, fibrous bamboo is naturally playing a big part. But there's money to be made from sustainable eco products which means that the quality can vary as companies attempt to fuel our appetite.One thing you may have noticed is that bamboo baby wipes are generally much more expensive than regular baby wipes - and \u00a33 a pack is not unusual. This box of 12 packs of vegan Eco Wave each containing 64 wipes presently work out to just \u00a32.08 each.So are they any good? I'm pleased to say they're great. They're far and away the best bamboo baby wipes I've had and no real compromise to be made when compared to plastic based wipes - but so much better for the planet.Add to this the fact that Eco Wave Baby Wipes are unscented - hurrah! - biodegradable and compostable. They're also alcohol, sulfate and paraben-free, cruelty free and hypoallergenic.But the single thing you'll really notice when you take delivery of these? - The weight of this box of 12 packs. That's because these wipes are very, very moist as well as a good size at 15x20cm/6x8\". They contain 99% purified water too. Nothing to irritate or harm baby here - whether now or in the future given their lack of plastic.I'm overall enthusiastic. Just one thing - I'd like to know the wipe's country of origin. I couldn't find this on the pack or anywhere in the listing and I'd like to know, hence my 4 star rating.",
