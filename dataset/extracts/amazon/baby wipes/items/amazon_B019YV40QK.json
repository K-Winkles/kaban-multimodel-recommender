Easy to wash and only once have I had an issue with staining from baby poop. Lying or hanging them in the sun does the trick if they are more resistant. It doesn't cause fading either.The one downside.... once my husband used them to wipe dirt from his hands when we were out and the stain from that has never gone away. I, unfortunately, did not pretreat it as I had such good luck. That may have prevented the now permanent stain.My baby is 4 months old and has not started solids.",
