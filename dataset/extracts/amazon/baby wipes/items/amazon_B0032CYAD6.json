One of my babies has super sensitive skin and this is one of two brands she can actually use without getting a rash.",

The package is kind of small so I am going to have to repurchase them rather quickly and remember to keep a back up, but so far the results have been well worth it! )I purchased these at a little cheaper rate because I agreed to test them and offer a review/feedback, but I fully intend to buy more because the results were that great.)",
