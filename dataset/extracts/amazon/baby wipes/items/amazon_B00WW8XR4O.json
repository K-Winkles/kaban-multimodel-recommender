                "reviewText": "I purchased the Eco by Naty Unscented Baby Wipes with high hopes for an eco-friendly and non-toxic makeup wipe alternative. Unfortunately, my experience fell short of expectations.While the compostable and plant-based aspect is commendable, the wipes proved harsh on my skin, particularly around the eyes. I encountered a rash after using them to remove mascara. The texture of the wipes is not soft, and they lack the durability needed for effective makeup removal.Considering the sensitivity these wipes caused on my skin, I would be cautious about using them on a baby or child, especially on delicate areas. The intention to choose an eco-friendly option is appreciated, but the product's effectiveness and potential skin irritation need improvement.Currently using them for cleaning and they have worked better for that.",

The only two things I can think of are that they lose a bit of tissue (tiny fluff balls) that collect in the usual places and the scent is a bit comparable perfumeless sunscreen. All in all a very good alternative to the less environment friendly brands.",
