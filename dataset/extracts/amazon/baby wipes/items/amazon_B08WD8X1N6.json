                "reviewText": "A while back I got into switching my everyday products for more sustainable ones, and that's when I found Eco by Naty wipes. I initially had no clue they were baby wipes, but I loved that they were unscented, flushable, eco-friendly/biodegradable, and thick enough to do the job. I have repurchased these things 10243947 times and will continue to do so now that we are expecting our first baby. They are super gentle on the skin, flush with NO problem (have never had issues with plumbing or toilets clogging), and last us forever. They are genuinely the only thing that help me feel clean, and I love that I can have peace of mind, knowing they're far safer and more environmentally-friendly than some of the competing brands.",

Just a few small things, they have a scent that I personally don\u2019t like (doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t like it!) and they are very thin - which makes it hard to separate them and pull them out of the packaging one at a time. I kept having to just pull a few out all stuck together and shove the extra back in ha. But if you like thin wipes, maybe they\u2019re for you!",

                "reviewText": "The wipes themselves are great, my issue is with the packaging. The sticky clear piece covering the opening will not re-stick after a few times, resulting in the wipes drying out and getting discolored. We have never finished a package without at least the last 25% drying out, such a waste. The wipes are also difficult to remove, often resulting in many coming out, this is especially problematic when your 5 year old attempts to pull one, and ends up with 2 feet worth of wipes.",

They dispense easily from my OXO dispenser (more easily than most!!). They aren\u2019t scented. I only have to use more than 1 wipe with really big poops\u2026no more than other bigger wipes. They\u2019re cheaper than most eco-friendly wipes.And most importantly, they don\u2019t irritate my daughter\u2019s sensitive skin.The only downside is the size, but that isn\u2019t a big problem. Also, the package is small, so that\u2019s a lot of extra plastic.If there were issues in the past, the manufacturer has certainly resolved them. My guess is someone was selling old wipes. Who knows. Certainly worth a shot if you want disposable wipes that degrade faster and are more eco-friendly.",

They stick together and it\u2019s impossible to get just one out of the package. If you do somehow manage to get one, there is a 99.9% chance it\u2019s going to rip. They are so thin and flimsy and you cannot wipe without them further ripping. I have an entire case of these wipes and I\u2019m just going to throw them out and continue my search for a better wipe!",
