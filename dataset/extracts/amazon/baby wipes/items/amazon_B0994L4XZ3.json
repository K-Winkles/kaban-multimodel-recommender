These are compostable so that compromise is acceptable to me. These come in a small resealable pack so they can easily be slipped into a bag. They do not irritate my sensitive skin and are great for on the go cleanups.IngredientsAqua (Water), Glycerine, Sodium Benzoate, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, Disodium Cococamphodiacetate, Sodium Chloride",
