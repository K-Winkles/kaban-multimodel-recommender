I was quite impressed.First off, I used these as a post-surgery adult who'd had bladder removal surgery and was adjusting to body changes. I needed wipes. These are 99% water wipes, 100% plant-based, hypoallergenic, plastic free, fragrance free, and great for my ultra-sensitive skin.They might be a little less thick than some wipes I've used, however, I've found them to be quite effective and absolutely wonderful for my skin. They help me clean without leaving any weird residue and they don't trigger any of my skin allergies.I'm absolutely a fan of these and would definitely recommend them. These are particularly wonderful for those seeking an environmentally healthier baby wipe or for those with sensitive skin.",

I love that they have baby safe ingredients for reasonable price. I only wish they were more moist. I actually use another non toxic safe baby brand along with these because of it. But that would be my only negative. I will purchase them again.",

                "reviewText": "I like these wipes. They\u2019re very thick and durable. However, they\u2019re a bit rough. They work great for what I bought them for (long haired kitten butt cleanup lol) and while they\u2019re fine to me (and my fairly sensitive skin), I feel like they may be a bit much for a baby.But my actual complaint is the packaging is terrible. Or maybe more specifically, the way the wipes are folded? Every time I try to grab a wipe, I end up with 3 and am only able to jam 1 wipe back into the package with one hand. And I\u2019m just trying to clean up a kitten, not a baby.I would NOT recommend getting these for baby care.",
