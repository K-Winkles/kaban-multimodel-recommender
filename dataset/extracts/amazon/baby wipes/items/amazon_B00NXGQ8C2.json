They're a lovely and very mellow little scent, smaller in size than Honest and other wipes which creates less waste, and the wetness level is neither too wet nor too dry. Additionally they are not textured like Honest and Seventh Generation, which I like.",

I can\u2019t describe it but it is not very appealing to me not even to my 6 year old. It\u2019s soft but it stings! I used it to wipe my face and it stings not gentle at all. I stopped using it maybe just save it for messy hands. Will not use on baby bottom or face.",

My next switch is getting away from plastic/synthetic clothes by renting to Upchoose! Just so much waste caring for children that these three companies try to combat and help the earth while caring for little ones.",

                "reviewText": "Commercial-grade composting companies accept a wide variety of organic and man-made products ranging from food scraps to wax paper and paper towels. One thing they don\u2019t accept is any kind of plastic-based material. That meant that the Huggies wipes I was so fond of for bath and baby cleanup (not diaper cleanup since that would be a biohazard and strictly verboten) had to go since they have polymer filaments woven into the cloth. The biodegradable and compostable Eco-brand wipe by Naty seemed like a good fit for my new earth-friendly lifestyle.Eco may be earth friendly, but they aren\u2019t human friendly due to their small cloth size, a dispensing design that makes the cloths difficult to get out of the packaging one at a time, and which have only a semi-moist feel \u2013 perhaps due to the lack of quilting on the cloth. I tried and liked the Honest wipes better (see pictures comparing the packaging, design, and cloth size of both brands; Eco on left, Honest on right.)The Eco brand may work for you and your family. For my time, money, and needs it just didn\u2019t clean up.",

My baby did fine with the Huggies wipes that came from the hospital, but after we switched to these he developed horrible diaper rash. Our pediatrician recommend ointment and to stop using all wipes until it healed up. After that we started using Dyper wipes and had no problems. Ran out and went back to the Eco Naty wipes and by the end of the first day the rash started to come back. Will not be using these on my baby again. Sad that I have almost a full case left.",

I know it costs more than your supermarket brand, but they cost the Earth a lot more, it will cost your children more in years to come to deal with the amount of waste we have produced. Perhaps you should give up the wipes full stop, I don\u2019t know, but definitely not the standard ones.As to product itself- it is actually not that bad- decent size pack, moist wipes, soft. The odour is not that great, but quite reasonable. I have also used them to remove makeup. Somehow I find these stinging less than some other brands. Overall I have to give it 5stars. I just hope it is not a gimmick.",
