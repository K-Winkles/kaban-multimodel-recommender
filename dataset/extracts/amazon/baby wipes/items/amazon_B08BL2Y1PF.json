                "reviewText": "Updated Review:I ordered these in November and it's now January 1st. I was sick all of December, first with an upper respiratory infection (head cold), and on top of that a bacterial infection attacked my lungs, then a week later, I got sick with Covid! Being so sick, I wasn't able to shower as frequently as I prefer, and the fevering (for both viral infections and the bacterial infection) got me nasty sweaty.These wipes came in very handy! I was able to wet them with warm water from my tap (below freezing temps in my area, while sick) and clean the important parts (lady bits, under breasts, arm pits, inner elbows, tummy, etc) before crawling back into bed.Because of the convenience during one of the worst sick times I've had in years, I have increased from 3 stars to 4 stars. I can't rate these a 5, because when I do wet them with plain well water, there's a chemical odor. I haven't had a negative reaction, yet, but I do find this to be concerning and a potential drawback for persons who are more sensitive than I am.So far, I'm pleased with these dry wipes. Simple, easy, and convenient. I do recommend giving these a try.End Updated Review~~~~~~~~Original Review:My photos tend to get lost, so I'm uploading the photos now; will write review after using.In the meantime, the English translation is pretty funny and I got a kick out of \"be careful not to eat by mistake.\" \ud83d\ude02Perferated top for easy opening; no reclosing, as it becomes similar to tissue box or dried out wipes. Packed well. No odor! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb I'm very sensitive to scents and odors, so I'm glad there's none while dry. I did purchase for myself, an adult; if product works well for me, I'll see how it does for my grandson.Dry sheet is softer than a paper towel or dryer sheet (another reviewer said it was the same -- it's not). Feels clean to the touch and soft. I'm looking forward to using these for in-between shower time clean ups.I will rerate & update review at a later time. Meanwhile, I hope the pics are helpful.",

                "reviewText": "I got these dry wipes to help with my baby\u2019s diaper changes and to deal with drool. I\u2019d bought them before and had some left from my previous order. But I just noticed that the absorbency was lacking. The wipes felt smoother, which I think affected how well they soaked up stuff. After using them, my baby\u2019s skin would still be a bit wet, and when I tried them on my face, they didn\u2019t feel as soft, kinda scratchy, to be honest. I've washed my face, but even after patting it dry with this dry wipe twice, it still feels damp.I got contacted by the seller after I received the stuff, and they asked to take the review down. They sent a screenshot showing they canceled my order and promised I\u2019d get my money back. But then I noticed that the order status said it was canceled before shipping. But guess what? I already got the stuff, and my bank charged me for it. . In general, once the bank has deducted a payment, the bank does not automatically refund it. The seller continued to claim that canceling the order would result in a refund, but in reality, that wasn\u2019t the case. Frustrated, I contacted Amazon support, and they quickly sorted it out.",
