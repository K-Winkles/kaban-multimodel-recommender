They are primarily water and aloe based so they are very gentle on my little one's skin and no fragrance has been added which is a huge plus for meThe wipes are a smidge bigger than some of the others I have used, and they seem quite durable, they have not torn easily and hold up to big messes. The opening is a little smaller than I would prefer but manageable.",

                "reviewText": "These wipes are great. I found them to be durable and sturdy to use on my toddler. We don't have too many blowouts type of situation anymore so I didn't get to test these wipes out under those circumstances but for normal cleaning these have been effective. Each pack has 80 pieces of wipes so it is a pretty bulky pack. The size of each wipe seems pretty standard, I didn't find it to be unusually large nor smaller than the other brands we've used in the past. The wipes doesn't have any odor or scent to it, it just smells like unscented wipes. I made sure to test it out on my skin first and didn't experience any irritation, just a refreshing sensation of water cleaning my skin. I've since used it on my toddler and it is great. I really have no complaints about these. While price wise these aren't the cheapest nor the most expensive, if you can get it with a discount coupon that'll be even better.",

My husband also keeps a pack in his work bag. These don't leave a weird feeling on your hands like some wipes do. They feel like I rinsed my hands with water. These aren't the cheapest wipes out there, but if you can catch a coupon on them they're definitely worth trying.",

Sometimes you need to run your fingers around the whole rim to hear it snap closed, others it just seems to close if you press right behind the tab. Not a bad wipe, but weird to get them closed, not something fun if you rush around and can't check the closure.",
