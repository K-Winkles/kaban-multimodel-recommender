As a result, I have to be very careful what products I try to use.Thankfully, most baby products are gentle enough for my skin, but even then, I still occasionally get a reaction.Luckily, these wipes have been super gentle and soothing on my skin and eyes!I never used to clean my eyes/lashes (I rarely ever wear makeup). But recently I got a nasty case of infectious Conjunctoblepharitis in my left eye. It took weeks and multiple antibiotics for the infection to finally clear.During those weeks of trying to fight the infection, I learned that I have Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD).I now use these wipes (and warm compresses) religiously at least once and sometimes even twice a day. I love the refreshing feeling when I use them!I agree with other reviewers that the wipes are a tad big \u2014 especially for only one eye. I tend to cheat and will use half of the wipe on my right eye and the other half on my left. I know \u201ctechnically\u201d you should use a fresh wipe for each eye, but as these wipes are pretty costly, I have to be as economical as possible.I read reviews about cutting the wipes in half, but that too can introduce and spread germs on the wipe (from the scissors). For me, it feels safer to use just half of the whole wipe on first eye and simply flip/rotate the wipe to use the other half on the other eye. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

I trusted Dr. Fischer wipes, and after some time of using them, by baby's eyes are fine. The wipes never irritated her eyes. The wipes are large enough that I could actually tear each in two and use each packet two times. the wipes are moist enough, but not too wet. I bout these wipes 4 times and will buy again, if needed.",
