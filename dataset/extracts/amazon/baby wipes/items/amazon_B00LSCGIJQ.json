                "reviewText": "If your familiar with Babyganics Baby Wipes -- This is by far the best value I've been able to find. Typically retail stores selling the 400 count for $25 before tax. Amazon offer the 600 count, which is difficult to find in stores (in my area at least) for a fraction of the cost. In addition to it already being cheaper, Amazon usually offers a free coupon to be clipped. When I purchased these they provided me with a free coupon good for 15% off. I ended up paying $20 and some odd cents for 600 wipes.If you aren't familiar with the product and now know that this is an excellent deal, here's a little bit about the wipes. My son is extremely sensitive to the point that where we actually had issues with diapers & chemical burns. As was already planned, I strictly used chemical free, natural wipes since then. I started off using Honest wipes. They were durable but the price is steep for a small amount of wipes & they are more on the dry side so I was finding that I had to use several wipes for even the most minute diaper change & was using an increasing amount of wipes when I really \"needed to get the job done\". Also, Honest products can only be purchase either online or at Target. I already use Babyganics Shampoo/Bodywash and Lotion on him so I decided to give the wipes a try. They are durable & a perfect in between moisture wise, not too wet but not too dry either. It was a huge plus that they offer larger qualities for a cheaper price. Win, win, win already. An added bonus, they can be purchased at several locations & are not just limited to 1 retail store. Babyganics also offers coupons, which Honest does not. They'll occasionally give you a promo code to use online but then you face shipping cost if you don't spend $49 or more.This is definitely a product worth buying. I'd recommend them to any expecting, new or any parent asking me for my opinion.",

Good size for women or men too not just kids.Safe enough to clean pet paws etc from worse chems etc and as surface wipes for tiny and Van/rv living...I really enjoy the toilet paper and the wipes are a nice combo for keeping super clean.Travel friendly as one pack can simply be used as small face and body wipes as well as in bathroom as needed!As I\u2019m so very highly sensitive and these do not set off any issues for me personally. I\u2019m pleased with their products all around...",

They clean without leaving me feeling sticky or drying my skin. They don't have a actual scent but they do cut odors.They are PH balanced and do not have the chemical ingredients I try to avoid.I will continue to buy them.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Decent wipes, but don't work well with our warmer",
                "reviewText": "We switched to these after using Luvs(gift from baby shower), Pampers Sensitive, and The Honest Company wipes mainly because they rated as one of the top non-toxic, most natural ingredient wipes according to ewg.com website and when ordering in a big bulk like the 600 wipes box, it seems reasonaly priced. Since having a baby, I have been using the ewg.com website to ensure I am using the best products possible for my baby.I do like that there aren't the toxic ingredients and the thickness of these wipes. I also like that so far these haven't left the white pieces of lint on my baby like Pampers wipes did. However, my only drawbacks are 1)They aren't as wet as I would like and since we keep our wipes in a warmer, they are even less wet and they don't seem to get as warm as other wipes 2)Additionally, for whatever reason, in the warmer, these wipes don't stay together where the next one pops-up automatically after you remove one. You have to get each one individually from the warmer. This isn't a problem when all of the wipes are in there, but when you are down to the last few wipes, having to dig for the wipes is a pain. I am not sure why these work this way. This is the first brand we have used where we have had this problem.My real rating would be 3.5. I am not sure if we will continue to use these-mainly because of the warmer issues.",

We noticed that other standard baby wipes had a quite strong chemical/detergent odor and my wife and I both noticed that they dried our skin out significantly. While we didn't notice this drying effect on our child, I'm assuming there was some effect we may not have been able to detect. We've experienced none of the drying effect and no chemical odor from the Babyganics wipes and find them to be as effective at cleaning up messes as the other brands, though none seem to be perfect at cleaning up poop!",

                "reviewText": "These are great, we use them for wiping our dog's paws when he comes in the house. We also sometimes use them to wipe off his fur when he gets really dirty at the dog park. I like them because they don't contain anything that will harm him when he inevitably licks his paws, and they don't have any weird scent to them. They also feel like they're not leaving any kind of residue on your hands. But don't use them to wipe off your phone screen\u2014they leave a filmy residue on glass.",

It's not a bad smell, but it's obviously a smell.Otherwise, they are a good, sturdy wipe. They don't pull out of the package well, and I often have to pry one out (and hope I don't get 3 or 4 at once, which is usually the case). I like these wipes. If I can find a better deal on another brand I would switch, but I have no problems reordering, either.",
