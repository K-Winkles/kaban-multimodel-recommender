There\u2019s nothing I can say about this product that isn\u2019t already said in it\u2019s product description. I\u2019m not capable of verifying every point is true by means of laboratory testing, but as far as using my own body for testing\u2026seems to check out?I don\u2019t love how there\u2019s talk about REDYPER on the packaging, yet no easy way to access what in the world that means. After further investigation, while a great start\u2026it\u2019s only available to 21 cities in the US. And at the cost of 20 bucks for each pickup\u2026doesn\u2019t seem like much incentive when you factor in the footprint of the process. I was hoping for a biodegradable product at the very least\u2026but I understand there are many complications to that. I was JUST HOPING\u2026anyway\u2026I would use these on my baby, on my pets, and on myself on a regular basis if I desired a fragrance free, plant-based wipe. I took a star for how much extra work I had to take to find out what REDYPER is considering in the product picture, one of the slides is all about \u201cKind Disposal\u201d.It\u2019s a bit too selective to make it a selling point at this time.",

                "reviewText": "This baby wipe is thicker, wetter, and sturdier than most wipes.To be honest, I got this as an adult because having baby wipes around is useful for quick cleanup, having something to wipe down a muddy dog paw when they are about to hop in the car, and more.However, I've used a lot of baby wipes with my nieces and changing diapers as a nicu nurse.This wipe seems larger and more texture than the common name brand wipes I was familiar with. While I haven't tested it on baby bottom with stuck on poo, this seems like it would do a better job than the smooth wipes. Don't get me wrong, this is very soft, but it's like the difference between the brown paper towels in a public restroom or using a name-brand thick quilted paper towel for soaking up water on the counter.I was pleasantly surprised by these wipes and look forward to having them around the house. I wouldn't hesitate to get a pack of these for a new mom or part of a baby shower gift.Hope this helps!",

They're nice and thick so they hold up well, requiring fewer wipes to do the job. They are soft, but don't leave lint behind like some other wipes I've tried. This is a huge plus for me, as I don't want flecks of lint showing up in my work. The embossed texture helps get into nooks and crannies, making them great for cleanup tasks.These wipes have the right amount of moisture to do the job, but not so much that they are drippy and wet.There are no fragrances added, and although I wouldn't say they're totally unscented, the smell is faint and not unpleasant. I have sensitive skin, so appreciate that they are plant based and hypoallergenic.As a side not they're made in the USA.",

Not a fan of the closure for them but they are an extra pack for the diaper bag. Overall a quality product.",

The wipes are strong and holding up very well, even for some \u201c tough\u201d jobs. The only downside is sometimes I only one wipe one time it may come out with a few, causing some unnecessary waste.",

The thickness on the wipes is very good and they are sturdy and do not tear apart when in use. I love that these are water based, as chemicals and strong fragrances are just so irritating to those with sensitive skin. I\u2019m really happy with this order.",
