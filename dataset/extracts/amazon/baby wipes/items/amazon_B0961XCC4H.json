I like the pop up top, as long as you close it correctly, they shouldn\u2019t dry out. They are great for travel and for home! I would purchase again.

                "reviewText": "I like that they're really truly unscented (no fake scent, just the aloe vera smell as it's a main ingredient). I tried it on myself first, and I was so glad to learn that it wouldn't irritate my eyes or bring the stinging sensation (when it accidentally touched the corner of my eye). No harsh chemicals there, it seems. Plus it's so smooth!I guess I'm using these as facial wipes from now on. \ud83d\ude05",

The wipes are unscented, so no need to worry about irritation. I like the tight locking flip top closure, keeps the wipes from drying out. I would recommend these to anyone!",
