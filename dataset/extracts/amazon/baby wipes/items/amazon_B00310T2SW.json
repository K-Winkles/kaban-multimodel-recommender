The seller took care of the issue immediately.The wipes are a little on the thin side and stretched a bit while I was pulling it out of the package, not really a big deal for me because I'm only using them for quick clean ups for my toddler who is potty trained. For cleaning your hands, wiping your face, simple spills, etc they're good. Although if you're looking for a stronger wipe for a baby, I'd pass on these and continue to use the Amazon or big box store wipes including generics.They seem very moist, while not sopping and are truly hypoallergenic. No scent which is totally nice and they don't smell like the inside of the package either! The packaging was easy to open, just peel back the sticker inside but make sure to keep the plastic lid closed! Don't want them drying out. Recommended if you get the entire 12 pack!",

I found that these were economical in the long run b/c you didn't have to use 10 of them with each diaper change. I would say 2 per change on average. They are soft and I can really clean my grandson off without rubbing his skin raw. I highly recommend these. My daughter-in-law thought these were better than Huggies brand.Just a note, b/c I'm trying to spread the word: Use GLOVES! I keep hearing mom's say how \"natural\" it is and that gloves are not necessary for changing their child's diaper. Bull hockey! Germs are germs...whether the source is related to you or not. I bought some gloves on Amazon, but Costco has a great deal on gloves that fit me better. Give me a pair of gloves and I can do almost any job...lol!",

                "reviewText": "I will comment that while each sheet is thin, folding it in half before use definitely helps, and there is still more than enough surface area left for wiping. I also need to mention that in addition to all of the perks listed (no funny smells, hypoallergenic, and usefully textured), this product is also comparatively inexpensive. Since I use wipes frequently for personal hygiene rather than for baby care, my main goal is finding something that will keep me as fresh as cheaply possible.Do a price comparison between 80 sheets of this product vs. the 84 sheets refill by Cottonelle, and you'll see that you're still saving money here. Cottonelle Fresh Folded Moist Wipes Refill 84 While I did not see this product being labelled as being safe for septic systems or sewers, I took a risk and have been able to flush a couple of sheets at a time down the toilet without any issues.The pop-up top is secured very nicely, and did not peel off with use like other portable baby wipes. The non-box packaging conforms to purses and bags when on-the-go moreso than plastic tubs.Sadly, there is one fault: The sheets are not truly dispensed \"one at a time.\" When you pull up a sheet with one hand, the next one clings quite a bit. Thus, you're likely to have one sheet in hand and then an extra halfway onto the counter. The only workaround is to hold down the other sheet with your other hand, which can be a hassle for a parent talking on the phone, trying to calm down a fitful baby, and trying to do damage control on a very very messy diaper... all at the same time. Otherwise, this would be a five-star product.I am currently ordering more.",

                "reviewText": "These are hands-down the best baby wipes on the market. I know, because I have literally tried them all. They don't have the offensive odor of Seventh Generation (those dry out FAST too) and they seem bigger, or maybe it's just the fact that they're the perfect wetness and consistency to clean any mess. I have left a pack of these open for days and they are still just as wet when I come back...I don't know how they do it! I have a wipe warmer and every other brand of wipes seem to be dry the day after I put them in, but these are wet until the very last wipe. I recommend these to anyone. GREAT for diaper bags too because of the plastic snap top, which is a heck of a lot easier to maneuver with one hand than those little \"sticker\" tops that some other wipes have.",

I have a Maltese (all white) and we use this for two reasons, 1) his paws have a tendency to get dingy after walking around outside and 2) I allow him on the furniture, including my bed and I don't want outside dirt and grime in my bed. These are a lot cheaper than buying doggy wipes and extremely effective. He has sensitive skin and they don't irritate his skin and the smell isn't overwhelming by any means. I like that is isn't in a plastic box so I can pop it in my car if we're going to the park but the plastic lid helps to seal in the moisture so this isn't quick to dry out. I hate the wipes that just have the 'sticky cover' that loses its' stick and dries out the whole pack",
