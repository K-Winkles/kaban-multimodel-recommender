I always carry one un my bag in case I ever run into a public restroom that is out of paper. I absolutely LOVE that they are flushable and don\u2019t leave anything smelling bad in the bathroom and it has a great size.The first wipes might be a little tricky to pull since they may get ripped if you are not careful but that is all.",

We\u2019ve been buying the adult version of these Nice n Clean wipes for a while and really like them.This Kids Version is the best one yet in our opinion. The wipes are a little thinner, but are still remarkably strong and don\u2019t rip in your hand at all. They seem more flushable. But they are still very soft, and have some magical ingredients that my 9 year old described as \u201cI dunno dad, these feel nice.\u201d My kids don\u2019t want to go back to TP. \ud83d\ude2c",
