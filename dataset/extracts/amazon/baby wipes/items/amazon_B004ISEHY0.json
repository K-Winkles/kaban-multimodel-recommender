                "reviewText": "These may be the cleanest wipes you can get, but they're really not easy to use. The wipes themselves are fine, the problem is how they're folded in the pack. It's very hard to get only one at a time, and they stay folded when they come out. So here I am having to use two hands to unfold them, and at the same time I'm trying to hold a lucky baby's feet out of her poop. It would work better if I were an octopus. I may end up keeping these for hand cleaning in the car and such instead of using them for dispersing.",

                "reviewText": "I searched biodegradable wipes, hoping the ingredients would also be of a higher quality. This product fulfills both of those personal preferences--the best I've encountered. I am a repeat customer who buys a 3-pack and gifts to friends/fam who have kids and/or similar interests. I am very happy with the weight of the cloth and the mild natural ingredients. The wipes are gentle on sensitive skin, and leave skin feeling clean. There is no fragrance added, and the slight odor is from the ingredients themselves, pleasant, not overpowering. *Important to add, the packaging clearly states \"septic-safe\" and \"compostable.\" However, I am not on septic. I choose not to flush these wipes, just to avoid any plumbing issues. So, I cannot vouch for that particular claim.",

I found these instead and I do love them for the fact that their more natural and no strong scent. I prefer to use the least amount of chemicals on my daughter as much as we can in products. They are not super wet, just wet enough too which I like. My only complaint is that their smaller than the ones were used too. We used to get the Chlorine Free Earths Best Wipes. I also do wish for the price there was more than just 3 packs of wipes. Doesn't last as long as I'd like. Thankfully since our daughter is no longer a baby we don't go through them as quick.",
