No offending smell, not overly oily, strong enough for the job, and reasonably priced? k thx",

Costco wipes last so long that I save them up and wash them in a sock if they're not too dirty. Fold up a few and keep them in your pocket for a man-sized hankie to blow the dust out of your nose.Wally World baby wipes fall apart. HEB baby wipes fall apart.
