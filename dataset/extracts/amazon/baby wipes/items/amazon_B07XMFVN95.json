The pack is big so sometimes it\u2019s harder to fit in the diaper bag but we try to use some at the changing station and then when it\u2019s down a little we put them in the diaper bag. They tear easier than other brands so just beware but overall we really enjoy them and the price ;)",

They hold a crap ton (pun intended) lol. You get so many for a small fraction of the price of the big brands and in my personal opinion with a 10 month old little girl these have been well worth the money. I have tried ever diaper and wipes and mama bear is the winner. Hands down. I\u2019ve told so many of my friends and new mommy\u2019s or mommies to be about them and they agreed 100 percent. Don\u2019t waste ur money on brand name go for mama bear. The quantity you get as well as the hypoallergenic quality is perfect. I really don\u2019t think there is another product that can even come close or comparable to how amazingly awesome mama bear products are. Absolutely amazing product!!!!!!!",

I also like that if I use her baby\u2019s face\u2026skin doesn\u2019t turn red.I\u2019ve bought twice. The first time. The wipes were continuous in my wipe warmer. I never had to reload the mouth of the wipe warmer. The second purchase..not continuous. The wipes break into about 8 sections per package. Annoying to have to reach in to reload the wipes.\u2022 don\u2019t dry out quickly. I\u2019ve keep a package around for travel, still hasn\u2019t even dried out at all.\u2022one package fills up Wipe Warmer Dispenser.\u2022size is perfect. Not too big or small.\u2022hold up well. I haven\u2019t had any issues with tearing.\u2022don\u2019t come out in clumps of multiple wipes per pull.\u2022awesome price.4 stars for not specifying if continuous pull through, and for not being consistent.

                "reviewText": "We used to get \"boogie wipes\" when my son was little, but we found those to irritate his skin and oftentimes they're scented and expensive...We found these and have used them for 6 years now! We cannot live without these! They're really great on his sensitive skin, they smell great - no fake scents, and they work really well. We live high up in the mountains where we're always either in the snow or in the heated environments so nasal issues are a common thing, these not only resolve said issues but they work quickly and I don't have to spray my sons nose or use anything invasive. He can use these on his own now and they're a household staple. They're great to keep in the car or in a bag, we all use them around here even the adults. Very highly recommended!!",

The only annoying thing is they sometimes are difficult to get out of the package and when you're holding the feet of a poop 2yo in one hand the last thing you want is to struggle getting wipes out of the pack. I'm being facetious, they are great wipes.",
