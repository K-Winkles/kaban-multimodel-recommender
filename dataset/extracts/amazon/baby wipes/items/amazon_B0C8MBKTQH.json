My toddler has never had sensitivity issues to wipes or diapers, but my infant has gotten rashes from some wipes. Luckily, this didn't seem to irritate either ones skin. I do think it has some type of scent to it and they are not super soft compared to other brands. But it gets the job done and doesn't irritate my kids so overall I think it's just fine.",

They are soft yet strong and have the perfect amount of moisture. They come out of the packet easily and are easy to pull out one by one. They don't have any weird smells and feel very clean and good for sensitive skin. I might continue getting these over the leading brand ones in the future.",
