                "reviewText": "I have mixed feelings for this review. There are two products with the same SKU but different formulations. The UK formulation, that has the picture of the girl with the straw hat, is great. It provides more hygiene than I can achieve with dry toilet paper and I have no skin allergic reaction. The formulation made in Turkey with the the picture of the young girl with no hat in a red dress works well, but I have a skin allergy to the ingredients which are not the same as the UK version, even though the SKU is the same. I have also tried the Kirkland (Costco) flushable wipe brand and developed a significant skin allergy (it took about 8-months). My problem with Naty is that I make purchases based on the picture (the UK version), and since the SKU is the same, I often get the product I'm allergic to (the Turkish version). Bottom line, the product works great but, if you use it for an extended period of time and develop skin irritation problems, it is likely due to the product. I wish they would have distinct SKUs for the two formulations, since I would happily pay extra for the formulation that does not irritate my skin.",

They don't separate easily so you have to use two hands to peel them apart, which is tough when one hand is already contaminated or holding a baby. They also smell a bit weird, like faint chemicals. This is meh. Two stars because they are purportedly truly biodegradable, but who knows, eh?",

The way the ad is worded is quite misleading in my opinion, \u00a310 odd for one pack of 42 wipes is just astronomical! It\u2019s such a shame that to be eco friendly you have to first have the luxury of a big fat wage packet!!! On top of that they just fall apart when you try and take them out of the pack. Definitely won\u2019t buy them again!!",
