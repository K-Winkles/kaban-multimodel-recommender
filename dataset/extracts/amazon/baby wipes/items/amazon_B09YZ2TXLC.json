Perfect size for a pacifier or a wipe of little fingers, or a small high chair tray.Don't make the mistake of thinking these can double as any other kind of wipe because they are quite small. That being said, the size makes them a good choice to tuck in your bag without taking up a lot of room, and you don't need an oversized wipe for quickly cleaning a paci.And they might be small, but they stretch quite a bit. That makes them more effective for tiny fingers and hands. And you don't have to worry about any kind of residual mesh because they aren't overly wet. But that means you have to use them up before they dry out.The video shows me taking one out, using only one hand, something that multitasking parents and caregivers will appreciate!",

                "reviewText": "Overall, these are great sensitive wipes for not only babies but also for people in general who have sensitive skin. I have used this for our small babies, but also for our young children and for myself and my husband. I have used these wipes from head to toe without any issue of breaking out or having any skin irritation. They are multi-use wipes, and they are great to have around. Came in a four pack, great value.",

                "reviewText": "I have two little boys ages 4 and 5, I already know what shopping feels like and the quality I want in baby wipes. Messy mouth are wet wipes that you can use in many ways and as described they would be exact to meet the needs of the little ones. However, I was not to my liking because they are not so moist and the packaging is very small, despite the fact that three packages come for $9.95 dollars, I think they are expensive since with this money I could buy more quantities and a good thickness and humidity . Honestly this product will not be able to be in the list of my hygienic needs when using them.The convenience of them is that you can easily pack it because of the small size of the package and that they will clean without soaking.Personally, I like them moister and larger because that way I don't have to use too many in one use.",
