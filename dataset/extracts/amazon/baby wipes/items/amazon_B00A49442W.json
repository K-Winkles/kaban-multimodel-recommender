I have done outside research on the wipes and cannot find any acknowledgement of this issue by Burts Bees, despite seeing similar reviews on Target and Burts Bees websites.The product is likely unscented with perfumes, as advertised, but the ingredients do not equal a pleasant smell.As these are not returnable to Amazon, I've thrown all three packs in the trash.

Even though they all say fragrance free, there is still a smell, and this is the only one i find pleasant.They wipe well and the pack is small enough to put into diaper bag.Burt's bee is generally a bit expensive, but this is a great deal if you can store 12 packs some place.",
