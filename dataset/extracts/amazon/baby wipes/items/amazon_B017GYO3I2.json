                "reviewText": "As a nurse, I know the use of saline is commonplace in almost all wound care. In fact, in many-if not most all surgeries, saline is the irrigation used for it's antibacterial qualities.THIS IS A BIGGIE WITH ME-and one of the many reasons I love this product.On another note,I wouldn't write what I am going to say next if you knew me, because it would be bragging in a way...but since you don't know me, I can honestly say I have a very young looking face-very fair skin-and rarely use make-up (I am in my mid-40's, and am post-menopausal). I have worked hard at keeping my skin pure looking...and one of my keys is NEVER EVER touching my face with my hands unless I have washed my hands well.With that said, These \"BOOGIE WIPES\" are a miracle 'wipe'....The ingredients not only have saline--[and that antibacterial quality is TOPS on my list]...BUT what makes these even better is that added to these is VITAMIN E and ALOE...other mainstays for my facial care.I will forevermore use these as my \"wet wipe\" of choice not only for my face (for the 'in between' washing times), but keep them in my purse at all times for hand wipes, use in public bathrooms, and basically wiping off anything I sit on, eat off of, etc.I also am keeping a pack in my bathroom for feminine hygiene and basic freshen up moments when in a hurry.Great to even clean your ears with...I can only imagine they are wonderful for babies and children....I haven't tried the grape-but am sure they are another plus when needing to use them with children. (I will say though, the 'fresh scent' is mild and truly appealing).I cannot emphasize as a professional and a consumer, what an amazing combination is found in these wipes....and is a true 'find' with the purpose to use for the original intent of wiping runny noses that need those \"crusties\" and tender spots addressed.I am taking this time to write this lengthy review because I never want these to go out of production....so BUY, BUY, BUY!!!!I wish stores like TARGET or WALMART, etc. would keep these with the facial care products...as you will need to go to the baby section to find them. They could actually be placed in several department of any store as these.At TARGET, one pack was about $4...However, I was able to find 3 packs-of 30 wipes each for about $10 online.I strongly recommend these...keep a pack in your car for sticky fingers, in your purse, in your bathroom....even with your cleaning products!I often wipe off a door handle or my cell with them when I am done...Safe....ANTIBACTERIAL, and soothing (VITAMIN E and ALOE).PLUS, with all the \"bugs\" we are facing today, you could never go wrong.Another thought as well...they would be a great replacement for antiseptic gels....for in my opinion, those gels are so harsh, they dry your skin, causing cracks which just strip you as one of your first lines of defense...being unbroken skin... (Even a paper cut can turn into an infection).Also, because these are wipes, versus a gel, they can be used to wipe underneath your fingernails.",

Honestly I\u2019ve also used them as hand wipes and diaper wipes when I had nothing else. And I\u2019ve used them on my own nose too. A must have, in my book. id recommend giving these to a mom to be even if it\u2019s not on her registry.",

                "reviewText": "From natural ingredients, to MADE IN USA, these wipe are incredible come flu-season. I use them on my infant along with my toddler, and I can't think of any better product. The scent worried me at first because they smell SO good, but no reaction to the NATURAL ingredients. 8 thumbs up.",
