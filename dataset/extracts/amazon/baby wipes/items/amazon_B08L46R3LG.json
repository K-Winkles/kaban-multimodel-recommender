They are relatively thick and textured so they reminded me of The Honest Company but I thought these were better, especially for messier clean-ups. I also felt like the wipes came out of the package easier versus accidentally pulling 5 wipes out instead of 1 or 2. I didn't notice a difference between the plain wipes and the Manuka honey ones.",
