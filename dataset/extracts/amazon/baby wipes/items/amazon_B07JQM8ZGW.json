I also dislike water wipes packaging as it\u2019s very inconvenient.",

                "reviewText": "We\u2019ve been using Pampers Sensitive Skin Wipes on my son for the last 4 1/2 years. When I seen these Pampers water wipes for sensitive skin, I decided to try them. I believe these are even better than the regular sensitive wipes. They are much more wet but with the same thickness and durability of the regular sensitive wipes. My son has broken out from other wipes, even other name brand sensitive skin wipes. So we are loyal Pampers users. My son is autistic and wears a pull up so we still use baby wipes and will for awhile. The great thing about these is that they can also be used to clean the face when needed, without causing a little rash on his face like the regular sensitive wipes did. These are the best! Priced the same as Walmart but easier to purchase via Amazon Prime and having the subscribe & save option is even better!",

                "reviewText": "These are the best wipes we have tried, out of about 11 other kinds for sensitive skin that we've tried since our daughter was born 14.5 months ago. They have the perfect amount of moisture to easily clean a baby or toddler's privates and bum. They are sensitive enough for most poop and rashes, but not really bad ones where a parent has neglected to catch or change the diarrhea for too long - then there is a slight sting. I just use paper towels moistened with luke warm water and lightly dab, for those rarer times. These wipes are truly fragrance-free/healthier/have less chemicals than most other so-called sensitive skin brands. They are average sized wipes not larger wipes, but not too small. They're easy to pull out of the container, and I love that the size isn't too bulky - they're the perfect height size and weight for traveling, for diaper bags, and even at home, for easy grabbing. I would definitely recommend these! They're worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "These are my favorite wipes. We have tried several different brands (even different Pampers wipes) and these are my most favorite. They are incredibly soft; they feel like a thin cloth vs a wipe. They also hold moisture well. We use a wipe warmer and this is the only wipe where I don't have to add water to the wipe warmer to keep them from drying out. My only complaint is when pulling out a wipe you'll get 2-3 at once, which is annoying when you're trying to use one hand while using your other hand to hold down your baby. This is an issue with plenty of brands, though, and the only downside to these otherwise amazing wipes. I have tried other brands to try and avoid this issue and have literally had other wipes cause diaper rash on my baby (rash goes away after 24 hours of switching BACK to these wipes). We no longer buy any other wipe but Pampers Aqua Pure for diaper changes.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love how soft, gentle, and moist these are. I also love the fact that they are fragrance free as babies have sensitive skin. They work great with my wipe warmer as well. That being said, they are ideal for pee diapers...I find that they are so soft and smooth that they kind of just smear the poop around rather than gripping it and wiping it away. I really like the seventh generation free and clear wipes for wiping away poo. I find them to be more thick and textured with a design that really just grips the poop and wipes it away with ease.",
