Have a supply handy while changing diapers to help keep your baby clean and fresh.For baby girls, while changing diapers, always wipe from front to back to minimize the amount of stool material that gets near her genitals. Also, be careful to clean all areas, as the folds in the skin around her genitals can hide urine and soil.How can I treat and prevent diaper rash?Red bumps on your baby's bottom may mean diaper rash. It can be caused by many factors, including leaving urine or bowel movement on the skin too long between changing diapers or even as a result of taking antibiotics. And when your baby starts solid foods, wait a few days between introducing each new food to see if the rash was caused by a particular food.If your baby has diaper rash, clean the entire diapered area gently but thoroughly with a baby wipe. It is also helpful to allow air to reach the skin. Talk to your pediatrician or pharmacist if the rash does not improve.Goes Great With... view largerPampers Swaddlers Sensitive diapers.
