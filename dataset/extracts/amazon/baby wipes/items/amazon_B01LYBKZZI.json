        "description": "Stack of 10 eco-friendly alternative to paper towels, napkins, and throw away baby wipes. This is a great way to help eliminate trash, and an easy way to help the environment. These are made from Super Soft 1 layer of GOTS Certified 100% Organic Cotton Flannel,very soft polyester thread and measure 8x8 inches. The Little Wipes are perfect for little hands, but are thirsty enough to dry big hands, too. Great for casual, every day napkins (and they won't fall apart like paper napkins do). Nice and gentle enough for baby's face or behind; and, a great thing to keep in your purse for messy emergencies when you are on the road. You can expect these work-horses to last for a very long time. Use them to mop up any spill, dry your hands, or for any typical use of paper towels. I throw mine in the washer and dryer with any and all loads of laundry (they take up very little space), because no special care is required. Unbleached Organic is softer than the white or printed flannel, lasts longer, and is better for the environment. Natural, unbleached flannel fabric is from a certified Fair Trade Factory, and cut, sewn and finished here in the USA by Americans. This set is in stock, and ready to go. Try them and love them, or send them back for a 100% refund.",

Guests have asked me about them because they also loved them. I have two small children and they didnt blink an eye when I showed them to throw them in the laundry basket (2&6) . We purchased a small hanging laundry basket and hooked it on the side of our recyling bin. Adds so much to our country vibe & love that were being eco friendly while saving $ on napkins",
