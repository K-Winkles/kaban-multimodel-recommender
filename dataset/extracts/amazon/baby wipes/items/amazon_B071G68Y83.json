But this is a product I am passionate about. And you do have to be careful pulling them out that they don\u2019t all clump together like others said. And that you seal them good every time.I use these for so many things. I\u2019m so grateful these exist. To wipe the eye burgers off my dog. To take my makeup off when I\u2019m lazy. To wipe down after a workout. They don\u2019t bother my skin. I originally was looking for a safe pre/post intimacy wipe. And everything out there was loaded with chemicals. With over bearing scents. These are barely fragrant which I like. I think they are helping prevent me from my constant UTIs. I even use them after I wash my sex toys. These do not irritate me at all I actually like them enough to subscribe. I\u2019m really glad a holistic wipe like this exists. Yes they are pricier than others but they are so much healthier for your body.",

I\u2019ve now replaced so many of the products in my beauty arsenal and bathroom in general with the simplicity and efficiency of these. I especially have discovered how useful these are to remove my makeup. My face feels so rejuvenated and fresh after using these. I have very finicky skin and basically all it can tollerate is micellar water. I dont\u2019t use makeup that often and only rinse my face with water in the shower, and since doing that my skin is the best it\u2019s ever been. But these wipes make my skin feel PERFECT and so balanced. My skin literally sings after I use these and I can\u2019t explain how good the feeling is. My skin has improved just from using these occasionally.Also, very balancing for the sensitive areas we wipe with. I now understand the meaning of balanced skin! I can feel the deliciousness of organic ingredients and how much my skin appreciates it. Just top notch ingredients, experience, and product. I never leave reviews but this one I couldn\u2019t let pass unsung!",

                "reviewText": "I like having body wipes on hand to freshen up with if I'm out somewhere or otherwise can't shower. I bought these after trying Seventh Generation baby wipes and not caring for them. So I will be comparing the two a bit.These have a slightly medicinal scent I don't super care for, but it dissipates quickly. I will take it over the 'baby wipe' smell of Seventh Generation however. Those say \"0% Fragrance\" (not \"no added fragrance\" or \"fragrance free\" which I know means the same thing) but the ingredients definitely produce a heavy scent, just not as 'chemically' as conventional wipes.I also like that the ingredients in Doctor Butler's are simpler than Seventh Gen. Seventh Gen is a good option over conventional wipes but they do contain plastic as well as a few other ingredients I wasn't already familiar with and had to check out. Doc Butler's wipes are plastic free and actually made of organic NON RAYON bamboo cloth. There has been some greenwashing regarding bamboo going on (I'm looking at you Boody!) and I urge everyone to research bamboo viscose/rayon before buying anything made of it. Furthermore I just personally like the ingredients in Doc Butler's wipes are easy to understand and I didn't have to spend a lot of time evaluating the product before purchase.Both wipes are about the size of a tissue, Doc Butler's being slightly larger. They're equally thick (thin?) and strong, and both left lint in some places which I think is just a general wipe problem. Since Seventh Gen's are specifically meant for babies they have ducks and leaves on them because you know, babies care about that sort of thing. I don't mind having both form and function in some situations, but on a wipe (or toilet paper for that matter) it just seems silly. Being an all purpose wipe, Doctor Butler's are plain.Both come in plastic packaging, which I'm not sure can be helped since they are wet. However Doc Butler's have the press and seal lid, while Seventh Gen has a flip top. I would expect Seventh Gen's closure to better preserve the wipes, but I can't be sure since I bought the brands at separate times. I will say that after a few months and about half the package the Seventh Gen ones are drying out. Though if you are using these as actual baby wipes you'll probably use them up before that happens.Design wise Doc Butler's is unassuming, while Seventh Gen's is typical baby wipe cute packaging complete with image of a baby. It's fine for the purpose, but another reason I prefer Doc Butler's general body wipe to a baby wipe, even if both can do the same job. As someone currently without children I can leave Doc Butler's out in my bathroom or carry it in a bag without people asking questions lol.Overall, both are good choices for a cleansing wipe. But personally I'll take Doctor Butler's and leave the baby wipes for the babies!",

                "reviewText": "I really, really hope these are restocked soon!! They are absolutely perfect! They have a wonderfully effective list of organic ingredients and materials without any of the bad stuff that other companies claim they just \"have to\" put in their wipes. They are also durable, soft, and smell subtly pleasant. Baby loves them - giggling when they are used - and likes to hold them and play with them. We use them all day long for hand wiping, diaper changes, spit-up cleaning, face/chin/neck wiping, etc., etc. I am positive we will keep plenty of these around for many years to come.The company told us they will be restocking these soon. Our household anxiously awaits their return :)",

                "reviewText": "I really like these wipes. I use them every day as an adult wipe.I love that they are organic and made of bamboo.A little disappointed that there are imported ingredients. Really wanted a product with all USA ingredients, but glad they are made in the USA.The wipes work well, compared to most other wipes. They don't tear, or my fingers don't poke a hole in them! Grabbing just one at a time sometimes doesn't happen, but it is usually 2 wipes and not a whole glob of them. Using them is a breeze, doesn't easily roll or bunch up. I found the best way for me to use them is to wipe in one direction, and not up and down (like I am used to doing).These are the only wipes I use, and I get them every month on Subscribe and Save. Definitely recommend!",
