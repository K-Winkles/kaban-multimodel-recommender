It's like poo-pourri or something which is just covering the smell of feces with an even nastier smell. These have no scent and they are 99% water, because duh. What do we use in the shower? Water. We're lucky to not have to bathe in the river or something and have access to fresh, clean water. These wipes mimic a nice, clean, shower. Blowouts? No worries. I don't need five wipes. They get the dirty work done and efficiently. My baby isn't exposed to nasty chemicals that are completely unnecessary. WIN WIN WIN. I used these for my elder child as well.

For that reason, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll buy this brand again, but maybe the lack of chemicals and reasonable price will sway me in the future - just not sure at this point.",
