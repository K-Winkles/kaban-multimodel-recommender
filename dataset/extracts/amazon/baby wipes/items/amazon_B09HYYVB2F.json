        "description": "No job is too big, no pup is too small! Luvs diapers with new Paw Patrol designs have your back\u2014and their butts. Luvs now has up to 12 hours of protection, day and night. Like Chase and Marshall would say, our highly trained paws are at your service. And diaper leaks? We\u2019re on the case with nonstop leak protection. Luvs Triple Leakguards absorb quickly to help stop diaper leaks before they happen. But our leak protection doesn\u2019t stop there. Secure cuffs and stretchy sides keep leaks locked in where they happen the most. Forget about cheap, leaky diapers and spend more time enjoying this ride known as parenting. With Luvs you know when they go, thanks to a wetness indicator that turns blue on contact with wetness. You care what your baby wears, so Luvs diapers are 100% hypoallergenic, made free of parabens and free of latex* (*natural rubber). When it comes to the ultimate diaper protection, these paws uphold the laws. Our diapers are so good, you don\u2019t need this, but Luvs does offer a money-back guarantee. If you aren\u2019t fully loving your Luvs diapers, we will gladly send you a refund. See luvsdiapers.com for terms and conditions.",
