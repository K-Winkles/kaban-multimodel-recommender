                "reviewText": "My youngest baby (and I have four kids, so I have gone through literally tens of thousands of baby wipes) has sensitive skin, and we had previously had an issue with a generic brand of scented wipes, so we had to switch to unscented.Well, these wipes are actually a better deal than the generics we were buying. I meant to buy unscented Pampers wipes but spaced out and bought the scented kind. My husband reminded me that I was supposed to buy unscented when I went online to track the order, and the package was almost to our house. So I was a little nervous about using these, but so far we have not had any problems. My baby is happy and rash-free, and the wipes smell great. Pampers has a different smell than other wipes, but it's a good different. It's more of a fresh, clean, maybe a hint of citrus, smell as opposed to the \"old lady perfume\" smell of scented wipe competitors. More importantly, these wipes are good at their main job, which is to wipe the baby with. I have never had to use more than two for a single diaper change, and my baby isn't old enough to generate solid waste yet if you get my drift.I cannot reiterate how good of a deal this is. I will never buy wipes at the store again as long as they stay at this price on Amazon. Even the cases of generic wipes at the store are about the same price or more than these, and Pampers wipes are higher-quality than any other brand I know of.The only downside is that these are the refill packs and are not resealable, so you have to have a container to put them in. But I had a few wipe containers laying around the house, so this was not a problem at all for us. Just putting that out there, though, in case anyone thought they were the resealable packs.",

                "reviewText": "I like these wipes because they smell nice, are thick enough (without being stiff) and are wet enough to clean the poo off easily. These packages come wrapped in plastic without a flip top lid like the Huggies but I simply cut a slit in the top and throw the whole thing in my Prince Lionheart Warmies wipes warmer. Wala! I tried doing the whole reusable wipes thing and it was a poopy hassle and mildewy nightmare. I didn't feel good about throwy poopy wipes in the wash with baby's clothing and it seemed ridiculous to do a load of wash just for a bunch of wipes. When mildew started creeping in despite my anti-mildew home remedy efforts like adding vinegar to the solution, it was game over. Disposables are so much easier, more hygienic and cheaper at this price. My son has sensitive skin in the form of small dry patches on his arms and legs and irritation if I don't clean spit-up off super well but I've never had any problems with these. I keep a 4x6\"ish piece of thin cardboard by the changing table to fan baby's bottom for daytime changes to dissipate moisture and air out the booty periodically. He loves the breezy sensation and gives big smiles. It's hilarious.",

I was able to get these for a lot cheaper than I've gotten any other wipes from the store before.

                "reviewText": "Pampers is by far the best brand in wipes. Pampers lasts longer because the wipes are thicker. It only takes one to two wipes maximum to get a poopy diaper cleaned up. The ridges on the wipe are fabulous at cleaning the extra pieces so that I don't have to do any \"scrubbing\" I also am able to feel secure in that I am able to provide my baby with a gentle wipe that won't irritate her. It is definitely worth the extra price to have a better quality wipe.Think about it..... It takes 1 wipe with pampers to do what 3-6 wipes of other brands can do.Overall: the non irritating, gentle, high quality wipes are well worth the price!",

                "reviewText": "\"JIMMY!!!\"The sudden screeching of my name came from upstairs...In the baby's room.I trip over myself as I'm sprinting upstairs -- I can't get to the baby fast enough.Then, the wretched stink of liquid rotting apple strawberry banana...Freshly digested, and smeared over everything.My wife is staring at me in disbelief.My baby? Giggling, and smiling at me from ear to ear...Inside his sh** smeared crib, with a brown-yellow striped exploded up his back.Immediately, I grabbed a garbage bag, and a pack of these wipes.My wife turned on the shower, and we went to work -- she would hose down the giggling baby, who's obvious well aware of the crap he caused...And I would wipe down the everything.Scrape by scrape, each wad of sludge would find its way to the bottom of the bag.Once the mess was over, a gentle scrubbing with bleach and fire would ensure a sterile environment.Could I have used paper towels? Sure -- but they weren't handy when I needed them.Could I have sold the house instead? If this happens again, that IS an option.But if you have a baby who poops, then these wipes will handle anything.",
