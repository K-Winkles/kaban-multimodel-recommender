Huggies Natural Care Sensitive Baby Wipes are hypoallergenic and free of fragrances, lotions, parabens and dyes.

But what does it mean that our wipes are plant-based? For your delicate skin, baby, we like to keep things simple. All of Huggies baby wipes are made with at least 70% plant-based fibers by weight to ensure a gentle clean that\u2019s free of harsh chemicals. Are these wipes easy to grab one-handed? Mom\u2019s got her hands full, baby. But don\u2019t worry, our wipes have EZ Pull 1-Handed Dispensing so it\u2019s easy to grab just one wipe at a time without wasting sheets. Using the toilet is an important lesson to learn, baby, but are Huggies Baby Wipes flushable? Designed for cushiony softness and durability, Huggies baby wipes don't easily break down after flushing. Please don\u2019t flush baby wipes, and instead use the trash bin for your wipes and diapers.",
