We haven't had a baby in this house in 30 years, but we use wipes like they were going out of style - to clean hands, eyeglasses, wipe up muddy pet prints, and clean all sorts of things. We keep a package in each vehicle, and a couple of packages around the house to be handy to grab. These wipes are nice and soft -- and thick! -- and durable! You really could rinse them out, hang to dry and use again, if you wanted to be really ecologically responsible. We've used two cases so far, and will keep ordering.The only 'con' is that they are as difficult to remove from the package as every other type of wipe we've ever tried. It would be soooo nice if someone would invent a way to pull out one at a time without it taking two hands and four teeth. lol",
