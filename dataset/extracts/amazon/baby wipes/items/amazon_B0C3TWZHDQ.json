                "reviewText": "Pros: biodegradable eco friendly bamboo viscose fiber;Cons: is at the expensive side;Notes: a subtle fresh scent, which I believe comes from the \"Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\"I ordered a pack of 4 of these biodegradable diapers, and I really like them because they are made with bamboo viscose fiber, which is environmentally friendly. The pack comes in a bag containing 4 small packs, and each pack has 60 wipes. The package indicates that it contains 99.7% reverse osmosis (RO) processed water, which is supposed to be very clean. Although it claims to be fragrance-free, the wipes still have a subtle fresh scent, which I believe comes from the \"Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\" mentioned in the ingredients.More about the \"Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\" (I didn't go through the details about these papers but only checked some conclusions and part of the results section):According to some journal publications [1], this extract is believed to have antimicrobial and antiviral properties and is not toxic (as stated in publication [2]). Aloe barbadensis gel has been used for thousands of years to moisturize the skin. And in [2] it mentioned that \"Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract\" has \"No reactions on either irradiated or nonirradiated test material contact sites were observed. No dermal phototoxicity observed\" in Table 14 of the publication. And in the conclusion section it mentioned \"are safe as cosmetic ingredients in the practices of use and concentrations as described in this safety assessment, if anthraquinone levels in the ingredients do not exceed 50 ppm\".About the size of the wipes:Without unfolding, the wipe is approximately 15 * 8 cm (6 * 3.5 inches). When unfolded, each wipe measures about 19 * 8 cm (7.5 * 3.5 inches). The wipes are highly stretchable along the longer edge (I tested and could stretch one up to 30 cm, and it didn't rebound), but they do not stretch along the short edges.Overall, I believe these wipes get the job done while also being eco-friendly. However, they are slightly more expensive than regular wipes. I would rate them 4.7 out of 5 stars.References:[1] Sharrif Moghaddasi, M., and M.

In my initial review, I stated that I thought the product was good and packaged well, but I had concerns about disclosure about the ingredients and testing.The manufacturer reached out and clarified for me that the listed ingredients are in fact the full ingredients. I understood that the list of ingredients was the full ingredients, but that the ingredients on the labeling had been mislabeled as \"main ingredients\" only (implying that certain ingredients were not listed) due to a translation issue.In addition, the manufacturer provided me with the product testing and certification report prepared by their third-party testing vendor, via the Amazon seller messaging system. I did not have any concerns about the test report upon reviewing the report. You should feel free to ask for it yourself, as they sent the full document without any issue.",

                "reviewText": "Second to the worst wipes I\u2019ve ever tried. I was SO so hopeful about these because I love the EcoBoom diapers, but they let me down. For starters, they are very thin. Second, they don\u2019t seem to grab poop or food well as they don\u2019t have much texture to them. Lastly, the way the wipes are folded inside the package make it exceedingly difficult to pull the wipes out. I\u2019m used to wipes being folded into each other, accordion style, so that when you pull one it gets the next one ready for you. That is NOT the case here. Each wipe is folded individually, causing you to have to dig for the each one. Suuuuper frustrating in the middle of a poopy diaper change. I am so glad we are working on the last pack, and I will not be buying these again.",

                "reviewText": "These wipes aren't sanitizing, which I didn't realize when I initially purchased them, but if you are looking for a gentle, environmentally friendly wipe to keep your baby clean and fresh, these do the trick. They are a little tougher than cotton wipes, and each container of wipes is surprisingly heavy. They also can bunch together when you try to take them out of the package, which is annoying. However, they are sturdy, well moisturized, unscented and definitely do the trick.",

                "reviewText": "These are the worst baby wipes I have ever tried!!! They DO NOT come out of the package, they stick together in clumps and you have to carefully unfold each individual wipe. Who has time to do that when you have a squirmy baby smearing poop everywhere? They are small in size, making them more difficult to use. Also they come wrapped in multiple layers of plastic, defeating the point to be environmentally friendly by spending more on bamboo. Don't waste your money on these, If you are super curious at least buy one individual package to test them out. I purchased the large quantity thinking it was a better deal, but now I am stuck with so many packages of wipes I dread having to use up!",
