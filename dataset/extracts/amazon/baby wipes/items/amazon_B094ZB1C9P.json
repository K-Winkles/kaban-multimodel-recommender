                "reviewText": "Why is 'seals well' a top consideration? Because i have lost too much money paying for 'convenient' containers/dispensers of moist towelettes that dry out and become useless as is. You get one towelette, and another comes out halfway. But there is ample room in the cap to close it inside. There is no drying out. The cap seals really well. To test this, i opened 2 of them. One to use and one to take one out and re-close. That one i put aside and didn't use for four months. Result? The top towel was just as moist and useable as the container i was currently using. Now, keeping it in the car during the summer when it is really hot, will not give you best results, you will loose some longevity, so I would not leave it in the car, but maybe a cooler part of the trunk and change it out every time you need a new one inside. That works for me. (temps don't get or maintain higher than 85deg F) They are big enough to get a job done and damp enough to do some good cleaning. And they do not leave a scent. I like that too.",

                "reviewText": "I love, love, love these. I've used baby wipes, every brand. Nothing compares to these. Taking care of my 85 year old mom for the past 4 years, she's also had \"accidents\" and I've tried every brand of sensitive wipe on her. Some made her red and she actually said that they hurt, burned. What do they put in the other ones, the ones for the babies? I've used the other ones on my hands and they dried my hands out. My niece handed the \"other brand\" to my mom to wash her face, I didn't know why my mom's face was turning red. After a few days, her face was dried out and looked burned. Then I found out why. After that I was using bamboo wash clothes because they are soft, but that's a lot and laundry.Ok....so, I saw this on Amazon. I read reviews. I decided to give it a try. HONEST COMPANY. I bought a 3 pack box, 60 each pack in SWEET ALMOND. I used the first one on MY FACE; it felt soft and smelled so good, like almonds (or should I say an odor from my childhood, a lotion). These are sturdy, strong as I used the same one on my hands too. The best part, my face felt nourished and soft all day long (I'm 66 with dry skin).When it came to using it on my mom. She no longer complains, is red or in pain from wipes. They are so good, I give them for her face too. My MOM and a BABY deserves the best one can afford.",

I personally would not use these on a young child as their skin is also very fragile. I have no problems with this on my skin as I use these to freshen up in the hot GA summer and I am 51.",
