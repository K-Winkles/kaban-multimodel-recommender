I did not receive monetary compensation to write this review, just the product itself.Picked this up because I need a new \"utility\" knife in the kitchen that was a low profile chef's knife and this fit the bill. Straight out of the package (which was a nightmare to undo, let me tell you) it's a pretty solid knife. It's got a built in V notch sharpener in the blade sheathe and it comes pretty darn sharp so no need to get out the honing stones for this thing. It chops well enough (I ran it through some root vegetables for making soup to really test it) and it's nice and light in the hand. It feels a TINY bit cheap but that's because it is; a whopping $9 or $10 (it's currently not in stock as of 10/8/23 so I can't give you a definitive answer). It's a decent knife for a cheap price that'll really last a long time between sharpening so I can't fault it at all. Hand wash only though, which is a bummer, but dishwashing knives isn't great for them anyway. Bacchus approved.",

                "reviewText": "Very nice kitchen knife, exactly as described in the product description. This has everything I was looking for. The blade is designed for meat trimming, but since I'm not a pro chef, I use it for soft veggies too like tomatoes and peppers since it's sharp and cuts well.* Sturdy and sharp blade for trimming and cutting meat.* Built in sharpener works well. The blade stays sharp, I can feel it running through the sharpener as designed.* Nice solid handle.* Sheath to store knife in, which protects fingers & blade when stored in a drawer or storage.Overall, I like it and it does its job very well. I use it as my travel knife when I cook at different kitchens (like at churches or commercial kitchens). So the sheath and sharpener are really, really nice for me, because the knife goes with me wherever I cook. It'd also be perfect for camping and deer camp. Nice innovative knife with a lot of uses.Hand wash only is recommended. No big deal, I do this anyway. I have a theory that automatic dishwaters can dull a knife edge (detergent), so I wash cooking knives by hand anyway.",

My wife particularly likes it with it being nimbler than our other chef\u2019s knives.

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m all for sharp knives. Did you know that sharp knife is safer than a dull one? Yea, that\u2019s something I learned in Boy Scouts. A sharp knife cuts like it supposed to while a dull knife slips and requires excessive pressure which leads to you getting hurt.This is the first time I\u2019ve ever heard of a self-sharpening knife. In case you have not figured it out, there\u2019s a small sharpener in the sheath. Thus, every time you put it back in the sheath, you are sharpening it.Personally, I prefer serrated knives. The downside to a serrated knife is that it\u2019s impossible to sharpen. Thus, you end up throwing it out. The advantage to this knife is that it potentially last much longer since it\u2019s constantly kept sharp.PROS: - Long blade - Blade is sharp - Self-sharpening - Attractive design - Good handle grip - Sturdy constructionCONS: - Hand wash only (no dishwasher) and then hand dryOverall, this knife cuts well, appears to be well-made, and if it can keep itself sharp, that\u2019s a bonus. I hope it lasts a long time.",
