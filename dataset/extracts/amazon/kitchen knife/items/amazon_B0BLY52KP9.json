Traditionally its single beveled edge.This thing is WAY to thick, has a curved blade, the balance is way to far forward (and yes I understand you should be holding it on the back of the blade not fully on the handle, its STILL too far forward) Then is the metal 1095 carbon steel chips easily, dulls quickly and rust almost as soon as it gets wet. If you really just want this look, just buy it from the factory... its identical without the laser etching of the name, and cost less than half as much.",
