And I love that they all match my color scheme in the kitchen with the all black. I usually have silver knives but I love that these are black because the older ones I had you started to notice oxidation on them and with these the black coating prevents that. The knives are super great quality, very sharp and the handles are very comfortable and have a good feel and grip when your using them. The shears where great used them to cut up chicken with ease. Big plus is that it also comes with the knife sharpener to help keep them sharp. There\u2019s nothing like a sharp knife when preparing food and these have definitely shown me that",

I don't need super fancy cutlery which is why I shopped on Amazon for knives. If you are looking for Japanese 8 fold metal, keep on looking. However this set is an excellent budget item and so far I'm happy. I haven't tested how well they hold an edge but the steak knives are serrated so I hope they stay sharp for a while.",

I bought this because my last set of knives were not dishwasher safe and I was tired of having to hand wash every blade every time I used one. I've run these through the dishwasher several times with no evidence of any kind of surface rust or deterioration at all. The block looks like it might be plastic or resin of some type in the pictures, but it is just black painted wood. Having a built-in knife sharpener on the block was a bonus as well.",

They'd also make a terrific weapon in case of a home invasion!",

My favourite to cut with is the big chef knife and the utility knife. I would buy them as a gift for people too! Great price for the quality of knife set",
