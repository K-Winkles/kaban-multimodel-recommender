                "reviewText": "I bought the 8\" chef's knife with 5\" utility knife combination (\"Beginner Chef\") for my mother in-law. My first impression, out of the box, was that the chef's knife felt quite heavy. I washed it and used it to fine dice a whole onion and a huge amount of carrots (julienne). The knives are super sharp out of the box. The blade went thru the onion with no effort at all. After using for all the chopping and dicing, the chef's knife did not really feel heavy. It's well balanced.The shape of the both the chef's knife and utility knife are a little unusual. The curvature of the cutting edge of the chef's knife is ok, I tried rocking the knife while chopping the onion and it felt fine. Attached are photos. They are taken with my Cangshan A-Series chef's knife which has a more traditional German chef's knife shape. Both knives have cutting edges of exactly 8 inches, but the backside of the ZongChuan 8C blade is about an inch longer, explaining the extra weight of the knife. The width is about 2.25\" compared to 1.75 inches for the Cangshan.The width of the utility knife is 1.1 inches, while the Cangshan utility is about 0.875 inches. Personally, I would prefer a more narrow utility blade.I give these knives a 5 star rating. They appear very well made. The edges around the handle are smooth and all flush. The blade is thick and strong, but not too thick. The edges of the back of the blade are rounded and smooth. The reported hardness of HRC 58 +/-2 should be hard enough to hold a sharp edge, yet soft enough to easily sharpen with a whetstone. This is the same hardness of my Cangshan knives, which I have had for 5 years and sharpen about every 6 months.At $60, these knives are good value.",

However, if you're thinking of getting some for or as a beginner and wondering what a beginner's impression would be, it's this: wowThe damascene on the metal is very impressive, and is extremely eye-catching. It really sets them out as looking like something special. In the hand the handle is solid and nicely sized, and the weight of them is confidence-inspiring. You feel like you're important cooking when you use them.To be honest I'm kind of intimidated. I'm used to the zero-maintenance life of ceramic knives. But these definitely feel like they're worth it.",

                "reviewText": "Ok, I cook for a living and a set of sharp and well balanced knives is essential if you want to have fun at your job. So, I am always on the lookout for an improvement or an addition to my knife set. When this knife became available, i just had to give it a try. Here is what I found:1. Most of the knives I have seen are light weight and not worth buying. People have a false impression that a light knife is easier to work with. Nothing can be further from the truth. The lighter the knife, the more work required from you to do the job. There is a point, of course, where too much weight is not good, but being light is NOT a positive point for a knife. This knife is in what I would call a mid range which means it is good as a general knife. Just enough weight to get the job done efficiently with a minimum of extra effort.2. This is a well balanced knife as well, that makes handling it easy and cutting a breeze. A poorly weighted knife puts strain on your wrists and arms and is a waste of energy.3. This knife is thick enough to do the job without being excessive. There is NOTHING worse than a light weight knife that flexes and cause poor cuts. Great way to cut yourself and have a poor product to serve.4. This is the first knife under $100 that I have NOT had to sharpen!! It is actually sharp and the rough edges have been taken down without me having to take a steel to it.5. Decent knifes are NOT cheap!!! If you are getting a block of knives for $100, my only comment is you are probably getting what you paid for! The price on this knife is decent for the quality that is provided.I am very happy with this knife and I have added it to my B&B collection. I would recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I would not by any stretch of the imagination characterize myself as a chef, not even a beginner one, but I do enjoy cooking and have been doing so for a long time. I also appreciate the utility of quality knives.I\u2019m not clear why the Zongchuan knives included in this set are referred to as \u201cbeginner;\u201d are they less dangerous than an advanced set, or what? Its not something I would know anyway. What I do know is that the two knives in this set arrive in a state of extreme sharpness, and they are quite attractive, not that I would have recognized the patterns on the blades as sea waves had I not read that in the description, but ok, sea waves it is.The knives are well balanced, especially the chefs knife. The fulcrum is right where it is being shown in the picture on the point of purchase page; right at the juncture of blade and handle. This facilitates an even distribution of cutting pressure as the blade is pulled or sliced through flesh, vegetables or what have you.As I\u2019ve mentioned, these knives are, and can be, sharpened to a very fine cutting edge; handle them with care. As soon as I took them out of the box, I did the paper cutting test for sharpness, effortlessly shaving off strips of the paper. They scare my wife; she won\u2019t touch them. In fact, inspired by their finely honed edges, I immediately ordered a set of whetstones. As yet I have never used whetstones, I have electric diamond grit sharpening wheels, but I think learning to hone and sharpen the knives by hand will be a relaxing challenge. And the comparison between the two sharpening methods will be enlightening as well.In any case, both knives included in the Zongchuan Beginner Chef Ultimate Edition Series, the utility and the chef, are impressive in style and performance and a pleasure to use. Furthermore, there is nothing I can find to criticize about them.",
