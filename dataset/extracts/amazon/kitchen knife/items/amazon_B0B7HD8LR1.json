What is both wonderful, and thoughtful, are the durable protective covers designed for each knife. This is imperative as the blades are SHARP and cut decisively! So, do not allow small children to handle them. Also, don't let the economical price fool you. These blades are the boldest, brightest and baddest (most effective) in the box - and they're cute too! I almost hate to hide them away in my cutlery draw. They are so fine that they should be displayed. A HUGE value for the price.",

I used it to cut up a slab of ribs and it sliced smoothly through not only the meat but the bones, fat and cartilage as well. I didn't have to saw or hack or worry about slicing through my fingers if the knife slipped. One word of caution though. Even after cutting through all of those thick pork rib bones, the knife was still extremely sharp and I nicked my finger while cleaning the knife. Just by more careful than me.",

They cut, they seem to hold an edge reasonably well. The colors are easy to distinguish from each other in case you are using each one for vegetables/fruit, meat, chicken, fish and you don't want to mix them up.You can never have too many knives!",
