                "reviewText": "For the home chef, this is probably the best deal you can get for a vegetable and boneless meat slicer. It\u2019s not intended for heavy chopping, trimming your doorframe or hacking through brush. But it will slice the thinnest vegetable and meat slices imaginable. It is precisely ground and tempered, holds its edge reasonably well and is easily sharpened. It responds well to both strop and honing steel. My hat is off to this company for providing such a useful and practical tool ,of this quality ,for such a more than reasonable price. I honestly don\u2019t know how they do it.They do require some sanding of the sharp edges where the blade meets the handle. You could cut your finger. But that is easily accomplished with a piece of sandpaper wrapped around a stick in about two minutes. Still the best deal out there. If this wasn\u2019t necessary, I would give it five stars in every category. At this price, buy two. You\u2019ll want to give one to someone you love. I have one and just bought two more.",

These are great if you need to grab a knife quickly and then throw it in the dishwasher (my higher quality knives are not dishwasher safe, so I save those for actual cooking / meal prep). The handle is hollow, so center of balance is a bit more forward than is ideal. Edge comes razor sharp from the factory, although it is on the thinner side so be sure to hone often. Overall 5/5 in terms of value for money.",

Al ser de una pieza, se mantiene intacto. En todos estos a\u00f1os no he tenido nunca que afilarlo y mantiene un corte f\u00e1cil y suave pese a cocinar mucho. Precio muy competitivo. Muy ergon\u00f3mico, c\u00f3modo y de peso adecuado, bien nivelado. De hecho, compr\u00e9 otro igual despues de unos a\u00f1os por si este se me estropeaba, y todav\u00eda no he tenido que hacer uso de \u00e9l.",
