                "reviewText": "Great value for the money with a large variety of different knives for the occasion.What I really found to be nice was how well the knives gripped in my hands - the wooden handles were serenely polish, but was not slippery.The chef\u2019s knife as well as the santoku knife was also nicely weighted, giving a comfortable chopping and slicing pattern on meat, hard vegetables, and other produces.The blades as the other reviewer mentioned was sharp, and the included sharpener are pretty standard.The 6 piece steak knives were also quite the upgrade compared to the ones I already have. They have a teethed section and a non teethed section, so you can control how you want to cut the meat. If its a tough cut, use the riveted section, and for melt-in-your-mouth or softer cuts, use the non riveted portion of the knives.I have been using iMarku knives for a while and I will say that they are definitely a great value. I\u2019m also impressed they offer a 1 year warranty. The knife holder/case is also solid wood with a nice finish - there is no chemical smell that you find in some other cheaper brands - this one is heavy, has rubber grips at the bottom, and looks phenomenal on my kitchen table!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this knife set looking for a quality home set. From what I can see and feel, it appears to be of decent quality. The knives are extremely sharp and I tested it on cutting grapes. Very smooth and easy cut; no issues. The feel seems pretty solid as well and they look very nice. The only negative I have is after reading all the packaging and the brochure sent in the box (see pictures). The reputation of the company comes in question when the brochure shows two different ways of spelling their company name in the logo (imarku vs marku). Plus, there are so many misspelled words (even misspelled their name in the brochure) that it makes it comical and hard to understand. When you visit the site, same thing. It claims to be based out of California but really traces back to China. For now, after a week, the knives feel of decent quality. But, I fear they may not be based on other products purchased from China similarly provided with poor quality marketing. I think the company profile showed creation back to the 70s, but there is far and few information that can be found and traced on the internet. For a company to be in business that long yet can\u2019t spell their name right, it makes me question the quality of the business and it\u2019s products. Maybe they focus too much on autocorrect and can\u2019t afford a quality control person. But, this seems to be they way of Amazon\u2019s future companies and products. Advertising great products only to get lower Chinese quality on the back end.",

We\u2019ve had them for over a year now and have only had to sharpen them once or so but the best part is they\u2019re just beautiful cherry wood so I feel perfectly happy with leaving them on the counter. Great price, great value, bought as a gift for my sister she liked mine so much",
