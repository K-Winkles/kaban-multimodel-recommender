                "reviewText": "It's not every day you purchase a top-quality chef knife, so it's crucial to choose wisely.Upon receiving this treasure, you'll first encounter the attractive wooden box it's encased in, increasing the anticipation for the reveal. And what a reveal this is! The blade itself is gorgeous, with a very cool pattern. And the handle boasts a marble-esque design to die for.But, of course, none of this would matter if the knife's function fell slave to failure. And I can confirm that it most certainly does not. At our house, we enjoy making homemade shoestring fries, which can be difficult to cut with precision. Not with Excaliblades! The thickness of the blade is distributed well along the length of the knife. And it slices through the the thickest potatoes as if they were made solely of air. Yes, this sucker is SHARP.Like most high-end blades, this knife has some weight to it, but not enough to make it unwieldy. In fact, it takes little effort to use at all. As long as you use it safely, it could easily become your go-to blade for any meal prep. A comfortable thumb rest seals the deal.Fortunately, you don't have to be King Arthur to wield this blade\u2014you only need to click \"Buy Now.\"",

It\u2019s beautiful and the box it came in is awesome. Absolutely perfect for your starting chef or loved one that likes to cook! Absolutely recommend! I opened this before Christmas dinner so the pictures are from after but it still looks amazing",

WELL\u2026..I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the knife. Everything from the box it comes in, to the handle, to the steel used for the blade is top notch. Fantastic craftsmanship. I like to cook a lot, and this will be my new \u201cgo to\u201d knife. Feel very comfortable in my hand and it\u2019s SUPER well balanced. Very nice. I would buy this again, even if I didn\u2019t know the sellers. \ud83d\ude02",

                "reviewText": "I saw this knife on a cooking channel, Drunken Migos, and saw how easily the host was able to slice through a cardboard box like it was nothing. He also took the knife and cut razor thin slices of the box and immediately I had to research the knife myself. I own a taco catering business outside of Chicago and I do all of my own prep work. Well I had my last even of the season this past Saturday and decided to put this knife through the ringer. Keep in mind that out of the box this bad boy glides through paper and sliced a tomato like butter. I cut up about 50 avocados, 3 red onions, 12 bunches of cilantro, 6 white onions, 3 yellow onions and like 15 jalape\u00f1os\u2026then once I was done I ran the knife through the paper/tomato test again and same out of the box sharpness. I purchased the knife so this is a god honest review. If you\u2019re looking for a handsome looking blade that performs as good as it looks then do yourself a favor and order it.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The Excaliblade shines like the light of 30 torches as soon as you take it out of the wooden box in which it\u2019s delivered. It\u2019s immediately comfortable in your hand, light, razor thin and very sharp. It is so sharp that if I am ever in a horror movie, and I have to grab a knife to defend myself from the killer, this is the life that I am grabbing. I have been using this knife for a while now, putting it through all of its pieces in the kitchen, and it cuts like a dream. If this blade truly had \u201cthrow me away\u201d on one side and \u201ctake me in\u201d on the other, I would definitely be taking it in because it\u2019s worth every penny that I paid for it. My advice is to put it in Ye Olde Amazon cart and buy it.",

                "reviewText": "I won\u2019t lie I had super high hopes for this knife\u2026 considering it had 5/5 stars even with 27 reviews that\u2019s is still extremely good. Sadly I am going to have to be the one to bring that from a 5.0 down to a 4. Something because I can\u2019t with good conscious lie in a review.I just purchased a set of 3 Damascus knives, and the full set was cheaper than this 1 knife alone; and immediately upon opening, this knife actually underperformed. I looks beautiful and the quality of it is excellent. But it was not nearly as sharp as I was expecting. I tried to cut an orange and it was pretty good. Then I tried to cut and apple and was actually kind of struggling to get it to slice through, I actually have to push down hard to get it to cut through. Then yesterday I was cutting some chicken breasts, and this knife was giving me a lot of resistance and did not at all give me the \u201csmooth like butter\u201d cut I was highly anticipating, and when I was trying to dice up some sundered tomatoes out of the jar the knife wasn\u2019t cutting like at all and I actually ended up just breaking them apart with my fingers because I was so frustrated at how poorly my knife was performing.",
