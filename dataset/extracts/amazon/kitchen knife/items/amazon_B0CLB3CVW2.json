The blade invokes the appeal of a hand-forged Damascus blade, thanks to the beautiful wavy patterns. The combination of the shiny stainless steel and black handle gives the knife a luxurious appearance. A metal butt on the handle, engraved with our logo, further gives this kitchen accessory an exclusive air. Cleaning And Maintenance Tips To ensure that your knife remains durable and looks new for longer, you'll want to make sure that you clean it thoroughly. We suggest washing the chef knife by hand using running water and dishwashing detergent. Do not use abrasive sponges like steel wool. Dry the knife immediately with a rag or paper towels after washing to prevent water stains from marring the surface of the blade. A Solid Investment Whether you're a professional chef or a budding home cook, you'll want a knife that gives you the best bang for your buck. That's exactly what you'll get with this chef's knife. Aside from lasting sharpness and an ergonomic handle, our knife is durable and can stand the rigors of daily use. It has a full tang construction so there are no worries about the knife snapping or breaking. The scales are held together by 3 rivets, helping ensure a secure attachment.",
