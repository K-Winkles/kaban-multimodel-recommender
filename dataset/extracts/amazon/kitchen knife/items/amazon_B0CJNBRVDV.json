The knife edge is super strong and durable carbon stainless steel. It cuts through veggies and fruit very well.The main issue I have with it is the shape of the whole thing. The handle feels bulky in my hand. It feels too thick and doesn't have any ergonomics in the design.I do feel that this knife will be in my utensil drawer for a long time, probably forever. It can be sharpened over and over. I just wish I had a bit more control with it.",

The packaging is excellent and the knife is well protected during shipment. Construction is a well-shaped and sharpened stainless steel blade that attaches to the quality wood handle with a full size bolster. The bolster to handle transition is very smooth. The metal butt does not fit as well and their is a very edge on the metal where it sits proud of the handle. Creating a star pattern on a tomato was quite easy. Unfortunately, residue from the etched logo started to smear, possibly from the acid from the tomatoes. Cleaning it with soap removed the residue, but still, this comes in contact with the food while the knife is being used.",
