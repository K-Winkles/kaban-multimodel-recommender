AllynX hand forged boning knife that features razor sharp edge, outstanding edge retention, and elegant Easten aesthetics is made of high-quality carbon steel, gets top marks for its comfortable hand feel and balance, its sharp, long-lasting edge, and excellent maneuverability. Professional chefs tend to use their chef knife cleaver upwards of 40 hours a week, while home chefs typically use them for about 20 minutes a day for meat cutting and processing to prepare dinner. To have a suitable meat cleaver/butcher knife among your kitchen cutlery would be the most important thing for every chef. AllynX chef's knives are coveted for their beautiful and detailed design as well as the cuts they produce. From heating and hammering the metal, to sharpening the chefs knife's edge and polishing the final blade, AllynX has chosen to use the best metals available in Western and combime with Eastern traditional masters, to create this art kitchen knife.",

You have more control over what you cook. This is one way to get the exact cut you\u2019re after, be it thick, thin, fatty or lean. What does AllynX do to achieve more precious and sharp cutting with its kitchen knife? -The stamped blade is constructed of high-carbon steel, through ice-tempered, hand sharpened and boned to 55 HRC for durability and toughness. -Hand forging creates the distinctive Tsuchime finish of blade of this butcher knife\u2013 striking in appearance, forging also has a functional practicality as it creates small air pockets to prevent foods from sticking, and allows morsels to be gently pushed from the blade. -The hand-sharpened edge reduces drag for fatigue-free use, and excels at slicing tasks such as trimming away fat and silver skin.",

                "reviewText": "My sister hit a deer Tuesday with her car and asked if I wanted it. The knife worked great, but the sheath didn't hold up well. The upper stap for the handle didn't make it out of the ditch. I'm not sure when it fell off somewhere between taking the knife out and putting it back in.As you can see by the picture, the strap for the blade won't last much longer, certainly not another trip in the field.TL:DRVery pleased with the knife, but sheath is poor quality. For the price point, I'm still very pleased with this purchase.",

Very sharp, stylish knife. Even used it to carve the New Years Eve prime rib. ONLY thing I didn't care for was the holster quality, but, it's about the knife, not what holds it. Holds very well in the hand for a \"uni-hand\" handle. Awesome job\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffd(it wouldn't let me add a photo of the meal, sorry)",
