                "reviewText": "Very reasonably priced for a vg10 core+damascus cladding. Ergonomics are pretty decent, and it seems to be quite solidly built. The weight was a little heavy and was expecting it to be a bit thinner as it's for slicing veggies. But... it chops really well, and comes super sharp out of the box. The only knocks I can give it, are it's a bit heavier, and the wood choice on the handle seems a bit cheap, but in the end, it's a knife, and it's meant to cut, and it does so very well. No more accordian peeling bits apart after cutting veggies because the blade is flat when it hits the cutting board. It was nice that it came with a plastic blade guard too, so if you store it in a drawer its safe, and keeps the blade sharp.",

                "reviewText": "Very nice, VG10 laminated-blade Damascus-style santoku knife. Good balance, good handle, super sharp out of the box.The layering looks nice, comparable to Shun. VG10 knives have a hard, tenacious alloy steel center layer, for edge holding ability. The layered Damascus pattern is mostly for looks, the magic is really in the steel metallurgy and the tempering. I was pleasantly surprised, I did not expect much for the inexpensive price, and the silly brand name. The core steel looks and feels comparable to some of the well-known brand VG10 knives which are priced at 3-4x. These knives are not for cutting frozen stuff, the edge is so hard that it may chip..but they are perfect for vegetables or meats, It has some heft to it, and it is a bit short to serve as your main chef knife, but it will find a role in your kitchen. The price is usually less for shorter knives, you are paying for the amount of VG10 core you get.Of course I have to see how it holds up (how long it keeps a good edge when in use)Will post an update when I have and idea. I have several VG10 and SG2 knives, so it will be easy to see how this compares.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Are you home cook looking for good quality knives at reasonable price? If so try these out. You can easily pay 5-10x as much for good quality knives & while theyre not quite as good as top of the line professional knifes that are several hundred each they are more than adequate for home use.Ordered paring 1st have never really been happy with the quality of the paring knives I've had and always liked the looks of Damascus so decided to get while the price was $15 due to prime days deal. It's sharp, handle is good size for me and has mosaic pin in it, overall very good quality knife for the price. After liking Japanese paring so much I also ordered Japanese utility, same as paring it was sharp, looked good.Both became the 2 most used knives I have and have held up well so decided to order the nakiri. So far is great another sharp, goid quality for the price knife that looks cool. Honestly the santoku or chefs knife probably would of been a better choice as they can do the job a nakiri can as well as others but I just liked the looks of the nakiri and don't have one yet & have other chef/santoku (although not as good quality ) already. May very well end up ordering them especially the santoku later.",

I have large hands so if I could improve it I would make the handle a bit more massive for better grip. Also the distance from the grip to the base of the blade is quite close and twice now I have sliced my thumb when adjusting my grip. I think it is just a matter of my getting used to what I am working with, and I still reach for this knife every time I can.",

Very pleased!Edit: Been using this knife for about 2 months now and it is still razor sharp.I wanted to mention how nice the handle is, gently contured to fit your hand.
