Other than the initial confusion, I am very happy with this box. All of my knives fit inside. My biggest knife is 14\" long and 2\" wide, and it had no problem. If you have a lot of knives with thick handles, you may have difficulty fitting them all. The box comes with the combination lock installed, and the combination is easy to set to whatever you want. The lock works smoothly so far, but I just got it, so I don't know how it will hold up over time. The box looks nice, and seems well made. I am surprised that I couldn't find many products available to lock up knives, since I imagine we aren't the only family with a need to keep knives away from members with mental health struggles. Ideally, I would have liked a box with a fingerprint lock for quick access while cooking. The orientation of the combination is awkward, and would be difficult to enter the combination while the box is in a drawer, since you have to look at it from the side. I intend to keep it on my counter.",

All but one of my knives are currently in the box and the lock won\u2019t work, the reset button isn\u2019t working on the lock so it seems like.

                "reviewText": "This is a nicely made storage box. It holds all my steak knives correctly with a little room to spare. I'm not using the locking devices but like that you can have key or combination access. It also included a small sharpener that fits in the box. This is a good value.",
