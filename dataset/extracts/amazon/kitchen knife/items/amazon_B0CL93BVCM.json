Nowhere in the item description does it say that the pattern is etched. The description is very misleading. Again, this is a sharp capable kitchen knife, but buyer beware if you\u2019re looking got forged Damascus, this isn\u2019t it.",

After about two weeks of usage still sharp. Will have to see after a month or a year how well it works. My favorite knife brand prior to this was the Korea.mn Kai brand. So far this one has beaten it out and I was able to get this one at a great price.",
