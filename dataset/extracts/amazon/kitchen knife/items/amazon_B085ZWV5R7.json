This knife has been a joy to use, for someone who didn\u2019t know he needed these, I can\u2019t look back.The knife is heavy and solid, but is extremely well balanced, making handling this EXTREMELY sharp knife a breeze. I was unsure about the black finish, but have had no issue with it, and absolutely find it helpful while using. The stark contrast helps me eye my cuts as well. 2 weeks in and not a single issue with the quality of the item.I recommend this for anyone looking to expand their culinary learning, or just moving up from a $60 full set.Only issue...I ordered the black finish (also the vegetable blade and two others) and I did not get the plastic sheath to store it. I am scared the edge or finish may be damaged. \ud83d\ude1e",

                "reviewText": "I bought this on sale for about 2/3 the normal price. I was a little disappointed that no sheath is included but not a deal-breaker. It does come with a little sharpener, which I've never used. I've so far only used a steel on it and it's held up well. I use this as a sort of utility knife or the knife that leaves the kitchen (outside bbq stuff, for instance); just sort of the bang-around knife. The coat is still holding strong and it's honestly still performing well (6 months later). I don't like the western handle much, but that's a preference for me.I'm not sure how it will hold up under a whet stone yet - the coating may be compromised. I would say if you're looking to replace your every day knife and can get this one at a good price (I'd say 1/2 or less) AND want that unique look then I would recommend it. If you're looking for something more long-term then it may be better to look elsewhere; especially is aesthetics aren't a priority.",

I have used it for the past four months and the coating has not come off nor is the knife dull fro it's use. My only complaint is the fact that it didn't come with the finger guard nor the knife sharpener. It only came with the plastic sheath.",
