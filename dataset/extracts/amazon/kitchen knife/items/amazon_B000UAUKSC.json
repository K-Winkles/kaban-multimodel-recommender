                "reviewText": "Pretty darn good for the price. I wanted to try this style of knife in a cheap version before going for the $200 version. It does very well. I chopped up a head of lettuce with it and the blade was almost long enough to cut from one side to the other. The blade went though lettuce very easily and worked great as a scooper after. I would say it was only about 1/2 inch too short to make it. I did try a think skinned tomato and have to use a little slicing action to get the skin to break, but not much. This does come pretty sharp out of the box just like it should but not impressively sharp. Its as sharp as you would expect a cheap knife to be. This seems well constructed. Nothing is loose, and I doesn't feel like I need to be careful with it. The weight is designed for a grip with forefinger and thumb on the blade while the rest of the fingers grab the handle. This is the preferred grip for this knife anyway and it balances well with it. The wood on the handle is not rough and felt good.After using this I will be purchasing a high end version one day but I plan to continue using this for awhile. I wanted to get familiar with this type of knife to see if I wanted a Nakiri or and Usuba. This is a Nakiri not an Usuba. I say that because some of the labeling on some knives can be vague on this. Nakiri's are sharpened from both sides and Usuba's are only sharpened from one. This knife worked well enough that I am not in a hurry to replace it and will be spending some time getting familiar with the different style and shape before I make a decision on Nakiri or Usuba.Picture for size refference.",

                "reviewText": "I think this knife is a good value if you want this specific kind of specialized knife.You might want to know that I'm a bit of a sharpening geek, and I spent some time getting the edge just how I wanted, but now that I have it slices like nothing else in my knife drawer (of about 20 knives). I'm not sure I would be this satisfied if I hadn't known how to resharpen the edge to my satisfaction. Others have noted it doesn't hold up to multiple re-sharpenings which I'm sure means they haven't known how to restore the edge properly. The steel is just fine. It's not super high-grade knife steel perhaps, but it takes a keen edge just fine and holds up when ground at the right angle.I'm sure it's not for everybody. I'm not sure how long the factory edge would hold up without some loving care. And it's a very specialized knife, really optimized for slicing fish into sashimi-sized slices.But I wanted to try out this style of knife and the next price point for a knife of this style was about $100, more than I wanted to pay to experiment.For those who might care about the sharpening details, I started by flattening and then polishing the back to 2000-grit (actually just the edges of the back get flattened and polished since the back is hollow-ground). This is a must-do step to get a really keen edge since the edge is only ground on one side (like a plane iron). Then I trued up the primary grind on the other side to 15 degrees (seemed like it was about 17 to start), then put a secondary edge at about 20 degrees when the 15 degree edge wouldn't hold up very well. With the secondary edge polished to 2000-grit, the edge cuts (slices, not chops) extremely well, better than any knife I've ever used, and seems to be holding up well with a gentle (ceramic) steeling before each use.I feel like I have a good feel for this style of knife now and might invest in a higher-end model later if the spirit moves :)Do note that this knife is shorter than described and as it appears in the picture. The blade length is 200mm, not 300mm, and the overall length of the knife, including handle, is 320mm. Knife length is properly described by the length of the cutting blade, not including the handle.",

                "reviewText": "Okay, a little dramatic, but it's true if you're not careful. Love the scabbard. Love that it's Japanese made. Shape of blade is excellent for working on a cutting board. That said...I tend to use smaller knives in my hand, pulling the blade toward my thumb. I've used knives like this for a good 40 years so I'm used to it. I'd not recommend that method if you're unfamiliar with how to do it or if you're new to using knives.If you use them as I, the back corner of this blade (by the handle) is sharp and tends to stab you while you're working. It's not so bad that it's stopped me from using it, but it is something of which one might want to be aware. Adjusting your grip helps avoid it most of the time.It takes a nice, thin slice while pealing potatoes. That speaks volumes.The sharpened area is nice and large...see the different \"coloring\" of the blade. It's narrow, which I anticipate will make it easier to sharpen. Wide-width blades tend to be awful to keep sharp. Think Samurai sword and you get the gist.Wooden scabbard (or is it bamboo?) and handle. The blade is tight inside the handle. The scabbard helps keep that sharp corner from cutting or grabbing onto other things, so I intend to use it whenever the knife is not in use.The price is amazing given how nice this blade is. The scabbard looks \"unfinished\", but I don't really care. It's a tool I'm going to use, not an art piece to put on display. All in all, I like this knife and would recommend it to anyone who knows how to use one. Beginners...keep it to the cutting board. ;)",
