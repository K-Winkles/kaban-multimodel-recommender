                "reviewText": "Disclaimer: Not a normal review, this is a vegetable knife, but also a very versatile butcher knife! If you are queasy, or anti-hunting/meat - probably not the best for you to read so avert your squimish little eyes, por favor.As an avid hunter/outdoorsman who processes their own game instead of taking it to a butcher, finding the right, no, perfect tools for the job make it much more pleasing and satisfying. If you don't like reading, let me just tell you right now, buy this knife; I have tried so many types of knives for processing deer and this is the best one hands down!During the 2020 hunting season I went to the butcher with a friend and noticed that ALL the butcher hands were prefering to using this knife and I mean they USED them. They struck bone, they dropped on the concrete, they were stepped on and tossed into a bin, they were abused. Inspection of the magnet strip on the wall showed many more displayed that had been sharpened so often they lost the manufactured shape, but still sharp as a razor (more of a reflection of the butcher shop admittedly in this aspect since they were re-sharpened) and they had gobs of them up on the magnet strip. If one of the biggest butchers in town use these knives in abundance like this and can abuse them for so long that they are re-sharpened until the metal is worn to a knub, then I might as well give it a shot for 7 bucks right?As a base control - previous preferred knives I are/were 9\" Dexter fillet knives. Dexters are made with a high carbon steel material with a large handle for better precision. They resharpen fast, but also rust fast too due to the high carbon. I love Dexters' still, and will still not hesitate to use it. However, this season I vowed to try this Victornox knife. I put it through the ringer and it worked SO WELL!*To the Review*1.) Unboxing:PRO:Unboxing the knife I was pleased to find the blade in hair cutting sharp condition. Although, not scary sharp. Some people would refer the condition of the knife as razor, however, my definition is a bit different. Regardless, a few passes on each side of a leather strop with some buffing compound really cleaned up the edge nicely and was infact razor/scary sharp.The knife is SUPER lightweight and VERY small! This is a huge plus for for me as putting it in a backpack doesn't take up much real estate and won't weigh down the pack with unnecessary weight. This is untrue with the Dexter. It is a bit cumbersome, although I still used it because of its superb edge retention and precision.The contours of the handle, along with the plastic material are grippy when wet. This is a big deal when hands are covered in blood, or when trimming silverskin/tendon from meat later in the meat processing stages.Con: The knife did not come with a sheath. For a hunter that wants to carry the knife in a backpack this is a big turnoff. My Dexter did not come with a sheath either. I made a sheath for the victorinox by using some thick cardboard paper (think double a battery packaging) I double folded this heavy duty cardboard paper material and duct taped it. Whalla, sheath!1.) Field dressing/gutting deer review: The first step to gutting deer is to make an incision that runs from the tail, to the middle of the ribcage. Making this first cut proved the knife's thin blade and scary sharp edge made it perform like a scalpel. I was very impressed. After this point, most of the removal is done by hand except for a few select cuts which I noticed little difference between dexter and Victorinox.2.) Skinning: This knife did SO well. This is where I was most impressed with the knife. It handled the contours of the body and stayed so sharp throughout this process. I skinned two deer this night with this knife, with no touch ups to the blade. The edge retention was amazing!3.) Meat processing: Cleaning the silverskin off deer meat is not a very fun task at all, but it is necessary. This little knife made the process so much smoother than using large fillet knives.Overall, I highly recommend this knife for hunters like me. They are amazing tools that take up little-to-no room in the pack and for 7 bucks, what's not to love?",

You have to be really careful not to cut yourself, especially if you are not accustomed to extra sharp knives. This knife stays sharp, does not seem to ever need sharpening. I got rid of all my old paring knives, this one beats them all. You can cut tomato slices tissue thin. It\u2019s an amazing product.",
