                "reviewText": "A friend of mine who is a Chef at a major 5 star hotel told me once, 'All you need is one good knife.\" It is the best knife I ever owned and I had some more expensive knives before. The other day I tested it and cut a pineapple to see how sharp it would be the following day, when I wanted to cut a pizza. It cut the pizza like it was nothing. Before someone says something, I do not put pineapple on pizzaIt cuts like a dream and all you need if it ever gets dull is a knife sharpener. My issue is 1 the blade is not sharp and 2 the weight distribution is off. You can easily rock the knife and cut anything you can think of.Now for a $50 knife you are not going to find elaborate ornate details but the craftsmanship is well-made and put together. Whomever crafted and designed the knife, knew what they were doing",

BUT\u2026 she sharpens up well and holds a good edge, it\u2019s very comfortable and well balanced. For the cost vs quality I\u2019m not sure it can be beat. Hand wash only, use your steel to touch up the edge, and take good care of it and it\u2019ll be pleasure to use for years to come. Love this knife!",
