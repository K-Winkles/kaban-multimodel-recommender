                "reviewText": "I bought these back in Jun 2022 and am finally writing a review in January 2024. These were my first Joseph Joseph purchase, after admiring and drooling over so many of their products over the years. I live alone, don't cook a whole lot but can't stand blunt knives. Before I purchased these, I was on the hunt for a new chef's knife (I had a basic one I'd purchased from Amazon, it was 8\" vs the 6\" in the JJ set) and a knife sharpener since I'd never owned one and let my existing knife get pretty dull. That knife was honestly just kinda too big for me, and I felt a little uncomfortable wielding it around. Plus it was heavy. I LOVE my Joseph Joseph set; they're perfect for me for a number of reasons. One, I love that I am taking care of these knives. Because they have the sheath that stores them, I find myself cleaning them quicker and drying them off sooner, so I can run the blade thru the shapener and put it back in the sheath. I definitely wouldn't want to put it in there if it were still kind of dirty or wet. So, these just help me take care of the knives more. Second - they have a built in sharpener! Not sure what else to add to that. Again, I'm not a pro chef and I don't cook a ton, maybe twice a week - mostly just cutting vegetables and tofu and herbs. But it's SO CONVENIENT to have the shapener right there built into the sheath - no need for a separate tool floating around the drawer.... And at first I wondered if it was redundant having two shapeneres - one on each sheath - but after a solid year and a half of using these, I can tell you that no- it's not redundant because each sharpener is proportionate to the knife, and IMP this helps sharpen better - if only because it takes the guess work out of it for me. I love that they're light weight, i love the handle grip, and i Love that they have a nonstick coat. All in all, these are just perfect for me and I'd highly recommend them for anyone. I can see them being excellent for a young adult who moved into their own place for the first time, or someone like me that is tight on space and isn't a gourmet chef and tries to keep things pretty simple. I actually bought a second set shortly after the first set. It's unopened. But i got it as a back up, to potentially give as a gift, or just to have for myself in the future!",

                "reviewText": "J\u2019ai achet\u00e9 le set de couteau Slice&Sharpen de Joseph Joseph, qui comprend un couteau d\u2019office et un couteau de chef, avec des aiguiseurs en c\u00e9ramique int\u00e9gr\u00e9s aux fourreaux de protection. Je trouve ce produit tr\u00e8s astucieux et efficace, car il permet d\u2019aiguiser les lames juste avant de les utiliser, en les glissant dans les fourreaux. Les couteaux sont de bonne qualit\u00e9, avec des lames en acier inoxydable anti-adh\u00e9sives et des poign\u00e9es ergonomiques. Ils sont faciles \u00e0 nettoyer et \u00e0 ranger, et ils coupent tr\u00e8s bien. Je recommande ce produit \u00e0 tous ceux qui cherchent des couteaux pratiques et performants. C\u2019est un set indispensable dans ma cuisine.",
