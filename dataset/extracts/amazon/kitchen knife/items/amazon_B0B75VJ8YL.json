That is a nice feature and one of the reasons that I am replacing an almost twenty year old Farberware block set set with this one. I am not going to part with my old reliable set, I am going to put it on standby duty although I am not sure why I would need to do that. I think that it might be an excuse for my sentimentality or worse...hoarding disorder. (:-)))).This Farware set is the same quality, the same fine tempered hard steel blades as my old set and the manufacture of each is exact and precise.Farberware makes a good product and this one is up to their standards.I took a picture of the set. The image will show the full tang of each blace.I also took out the butcher knife so you could see it full length. Again, full tang tempered steel. Tough hard steel but you can still flex the blade.Quality product all the way.I am pleased with the set.My interest in reviewing this Farberware item was predicated upon my past experience with the Farberware name. I was interested in determining whether or not Farberware was maintaining their standards and reputation for making a nice looking quality product at a fair price. Without doubt in my mind they are! This is a really nice set, and like I said...it should be at home in kitchens everywhere...even in yours.I give this sixteen piece Farberware Edgekeeper sixteen piece set five stars.Five Stars for the Farberware Edgekeeper 16 piece set.",

                "reviewText": "Today I am looking at the Farberware Edgekeeper 16 piece knife set. If you've ever bought knives on a budget, you're well familiar with this brand. These are actually replacing my old Farberware knife set, so I already had a good idea of what to expect. With that in mind, let's hop in, shall we?The first impressions were a mixed bag. The block looks nice, and I definitely like the new sharpener, as my 11 year old set still had the pole sharpener. All of the knives appear to be sharp enough for the task at hand, but, I couldn't help but notice there are some imperfections in the knives themselves. On pretty much every knife, the front side top of the handle looks like it was broken off of the mold used. It doesn't affect the quality, and honestly most people would never notice it, but it is there.Beyond that, I definitely like the knives. They're sharp and cut without too much of an issue, they sharpen with ease thanks to the updated knife sharpener built right in to the block, and outside of the aforementioned blemish on each handle they feel pretty well made. They definitely don't feel like the handle is going to fall apart on you when you're dicing shallots for your meal. Obviously, these aren't $100 a piece high end knives that will split a hair on contact, but I sincerely doubt you could find a better set at the price these are presently at.I have no qualms advising these knives to anyone who needs knives but are on a budget. It really is a great set for the price, even if there appeared to be some Q/C issues on the fabrication of the handles. I'll give them 4 out of 5 stars, only removing one for the handle situation.",

                "reviewText": "I got this knife set thinking that it looked pretty nice for the cost, and I've been using an Amazon Basics knife set for the last couple years, so I expected them to be a great value. These knives are decent, but somewhat of a letdown after using cheaper knives that are more sturdy feeling.Points worth mentioning:The pins holding the handle on one of the knives was loose when I got it. I didn't notice it until I washed them, and when I turned the water off, water poured out of the handle. I used a pair of pliers to pinch in the pins further, which successfully tightened it down. I don't really trust the included sharpener either, but it is definitely better than the rods included with many cheap knife sets.While this may seem overly negative so far, the set has some positive qualities too. The knives are definitely sharp enough for normal use. In addition, I think the knife block and the set overall looks great compared to other sets in the price range.",

                "reviewText": "We don\u2019t have a lot of counter space, so this knife block set is the perfect size for us! (See in my photo how it\u2019s a bit smaller than my standard 2 slice toaster). My old set was much taller, bulkier, and not as angled, so harder to grab the larger knives when needed. This set has a nice profile and more angled design for easier access. My husband\u2019s impressed by the built-in sharpener, and uses it probably more often than necessary;) The small steak knives are smooth and not as serrated as my old knives from IKEA, but they cut through chicken and steak just fine. For this price point, they seem sturdy. I wouldn\u2019t call them flimsy, but definitely not thick blades. They meet our needs for how often we cook and use them which is a couple times per week. The scissors actually have a good weight and feel to them. I\u2019d definitely recommend this set to anyone who has limited space and likes a simple clean design with built-in sharpening capabilities.",
