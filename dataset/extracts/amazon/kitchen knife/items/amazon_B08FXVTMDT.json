It is a great knife, perhaps the equal of the Henckels I grew up using 40 years ago. I am going to get the 7\" santuko and if the grips are as large it will be a winner. As good as it is, it would still benefit from a 10% bump in grip size. As far as the others in his set, unfortunately knifemakers seem to think like screwdriver makers do and assume if the blade is small the grip should be small. Human hands beg to differ; they want one size, one comfortable fit for even the smaller size blades. Notwithstanding, a great starter set or vacation home set. Super sharp, super value",

                "reviewText": "If Amazon allowed it, this would be a 4.5 star review. If you are looking at these knives, you are probably in the market for German style forged knives at a more affordable price than the actual German knife makers. In that market, Mercer is the big player and Tramontina is often overlooked. But the Brazilians are running an old world forge down there and the under twenty five dollar price for this set of three is hard to beat. Note that I am ignoring the \"budget\" lines that Zwilling and Wustoff make in China; I do have some experience with those and I do not recommend.I have a fairly ridiculous collection of kitchen knives and these are not the equal of those. But once you factor in price, I think this set is an excellent value. I bought these to give to a family member who has the most atrocious set of knives imaginable and I expect them to give good service for many years. I was not sold on the handle to look at it, but I found it to be pretty comfortable if you use a pinch grip.The negatives I found included a chip in the handle that should not have cleared quality control. The spine of the knife is not rounded at all and is fairly sharp. The full old-style bolster will make future sharpening (which will be me) a pain. When you factor in that this set of three cost about 25% of the cost of a basic German chef knife, those issues come into perspective and don't seem so bad.All three knives came with pretty decent sheaths, which was an unexpected bonus. I think this set is ideal for college students, people starting out with cooking, as a traveling set when you stay in AirBnB type places, or knives for family members who have no idea what a good knife is like.I don't have any Mercer knives, so I cannot directly compare, but this set of three was still less than the cost of one forged Mercer Chef knife. For the price I paid for these I am pleased. They are likely better than the knives in 75% of homes and cost less than a good bottle of wine. I am honestly tempted to buy another set to run in my own kitchen just to see how well they do.",
