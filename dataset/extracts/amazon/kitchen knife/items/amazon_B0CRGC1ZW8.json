                "reviewText": "This is a decent knife storage system made by Cook N Home. I bought two (2) of them to go in my drawer & they are a perfect fit for my W\u00fcsthof Classic 20-Piece Knife Block Set and still left room for a few random pieces.This allowed me to securely store them securely in a drawer. By removing my knives from the knife block, I was able to free up valuable counter space.Some reviewers mentioned their meat cleaver didn't close in the drawer. Mine fit just fine, I just had to reverse it around in the drawer. This will also depend on how deep your drawer is as well as the size of your meat cleaver. Just be sure to measure the inside of your drawer & compare it to the dimensions in the listing.As far as a description goes, this item is made of bamboo, as stated. The bamboo looks as good as any other wood species. It is nice & smooth to touch & has a hefty weight to it. It functions as intended and looks good on display.If you need a safe place to store your knives, this one may be just what the butcher ordered! :)",

However, it didn't come with a knife block and we hardly ever have the counter space to store them anyway. This was a lifesaver! Instead of these expensive knives being loose in a drawer, my entire home maker set fits like a charm (not including the two carving forks).It looks perfect in my drawer next to our bamboo silverware organizer! Would buy again!I will say, when I first opened the package, there were bugs inside. I don't know if this happened when they packed it or while it was traveling. Per the instructions, I rinsed it in hot soapy water and let it air dry. I waited a few days to be sure before I used it. No problems since.",

This is universal, so it's larger than it needs to be (my longest knife is probably 8-9\"), but there's plenty of room in the drawer. And I'm sure others have longer knives.There's room for six large knives on the bottom, and 5 smaller knives on the top (like steak knives or paring knives). This should really be 7 on the bottom and 6 on top, since most steak knives are sold in sets of 6.",

I had a block holder for my knives and although at first it was nice, after a while it would get filled with dust and gunk and just looked pretty gross. I dont like clutter on my counters so a knife block wasnt really for me. I love this knife organizer and the way it stores all of my knives both big and small nice and tidy in a drawer! And its super sleek and modern, everyone loves it and thinks its super cool!",
