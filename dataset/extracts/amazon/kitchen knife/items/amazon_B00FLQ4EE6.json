I purchased myself some knives elsewhere and was very disappointed in them, and along came Cuisinart.I like how they have a knife for every situation with a matching sheath, and I also really enjoy the rainbow colors they come in. It helps to remember which knife you used with what type of food to avoid cross contamination.These knives have worked like a charm when I've used them, and I was very surprised by their sharpness. For the price point, I was only expecting a minor upgrade from my previous set, but they have exceeded my expectations.",

In addition to knowing I have a sharp knife when I need one.10/10 would recommend.",
