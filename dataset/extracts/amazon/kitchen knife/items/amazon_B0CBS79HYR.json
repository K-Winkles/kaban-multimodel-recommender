                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars *SHORT TERM UPDATE* Avoid if you don't sharpen your knives; needs a polish right out of the box.",
                "reviewText": "*Update-from 5/5 stars to 3/5*Initially, I expressed doubts about how long the edge would last with such a rough ground bevel, but considering the knife was razor sharp, I did not dock any stars. Now, I can confirm that this is a problem. I care for my knives well--always use a cutting board, always wash by hand immediately after use, always store in a knife block--but that wasn't enough to maintain the edge on this knife. It is still sharp, but degradation at this rate is unacceptable at this price point.For comparison, I have a cheap <$15 8\" faberware chefs knife that I put a polished edge on once or twice a year. It's our beater knife and the one everyone else grabs most frequently, but despite more use, an even more aggressive edge angle, and not having been sharpened since July, it's holding it's edge better than this knife. \"Cheap\" vs \"Expensive\" steel...it's more about the edge.To me, this means, despite the cost, despite whether the knife is sharp out of the box, it will need a new edge. This is unacceptable for a knife as expensive as this and a deal breaker for those who don't sharpen their knives.One additional complaint: the knife has a point right where your hand sits. Maybe this is normal for this style of knife, but I did cut my hand on it. I immediately ground off the point . It doesn't need to be there in my opinion, but I'm not making nigiri here.*Original review for reference*I cook a lot, I like sharp knives, I have quite a few of them, and I regularly maintain them. Much about kitchen knives (and tools in general) is personal preference and use case, but this knife is a functional work of art. Material and finish feel very high end. It puts all of my knives to shame in that category. In the hand, it feels very light but well made and rigid. Choked up, fingers pinching the blade, gives plenty of fine control. The handle is also long enough that I can pivot it, playing it like a drum stick- extremely fast mincing.Overall, this is a nice, useful addition to a traditional chef's knife and a smaller knife for pairing. I will say, you'll probably want a cleaver for meat prep, but again, it's all about preference.Still, knives are tools, and when the near $100 MSRP is considered, I feel they missed the mark, by JUST a hair. I do not like the bevel they put on. For the uninitiated, you generally want a polished knife bevel; this aids in edge retention over the long haul. It's hard to see in photos, but the bevel is much more crude than even my workhorse victorinox that hasn't seen my sharpening stones for months. Don't get me wrong, the edge is razor sharp, but it's a bit jarring to go from polished steel to a rough machine ground edge edge. I feel I could put a smoother bevel on with just a 750 grit sharpening stone.Still, sharp is sharp, and I can't remember the last time I got a knife or tool with my perfect, preferred bevel/edge. I'll use it for a while as is before giving the ole shapton 8000 grit beauty.",

                "reviewText": "We have a lot of knives. We've spent a lot of money on knives. I have brought single-edge knives back from Japan. I've been known to hone favorite knives until I can shave hair from my arm with them.The blade of this knife is one of the finest cutting experiences I have ever known. It glides through anything as if the 'anything' were not there. Since the day we received it, this is the knife both my wife and I reach for, when cooking. It is gorgeous to look upon, and a pleasure to use.The Olive Wood handle is beautiful, as is the Damascus look in the blade (see pictures).For personal taste, I find the balance to be a bit forward when gripping the handle, perhaps more balanced when pinching the back blade edge for certain motions.As much as I love this knife, I do think a hundred bucks is a little much for it, and so I must take that into account. But, had I decided to spend a hundo on a knife .... this might just be the one. Seriously, it is nearly 1am, and I almost want to go cook something, just so I can use it again.",
