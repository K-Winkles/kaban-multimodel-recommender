                "reviewText": "Really cool looking. Better for outdoor camping use. Not sharp out of the box except for the amazingly sharp point. Knife is too thick for most food prep jobs. Any firm product like cheese or steak will get spread and hang up your downward pressure before being cut (maybe not a problem if the knife were sharper) the hole in the blade is really nice and would make you much more confident in a battle in the woods. I haven't had discoloration problems like others report. Should probably be dried and oiled after use. For the money, very happy. It's cool looking!",

                "reviewText": "This is a good knife for cutting most things but excels in cutting up chicken. I was a meat cutter back in the 1970's and using an old fashion butcher cleaver, I could cut up 60 lbs of chicken in around 5-6 minutes. The old cleavers are hard to find now but this knife has a strong tang and back which is suited for cutting thru bones and joints. Also works well for chopping vegetables for soup. Made in Japan and easy to sharpen. If you work in the kitchen, this is a great knife.",

Upon receipt of the knife, I tried to cut a tomato and the knife was so dull it would not even pierce the tomato skin. I took the knife to a piece of paper and again, it would not even cut thru paper the way the video said it would. Truly disappointing- sending this knife back to get my money back.",
