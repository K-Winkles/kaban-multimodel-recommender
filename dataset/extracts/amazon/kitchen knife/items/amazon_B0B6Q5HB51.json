                "reviewText": "I really like these knives. I do a lot of cooking, I enjoy it. I took a few cooking classes with some pros when I worked as a manager at a large chain restaurant that has good quality food & I discovered that to me preparing a large gourmet meal is relaxing & rewarding, especially if it's for friends & family. It does mess up your \"groove\" though when you are trying to chop, slice, etc. with dull, badly handled knives.At the restaurant we used great knives & they were kept sharp. I loved them, but for some reason I never invested in a good set for myself at home. My knives weren't bad, & I sharpened them regularly, but I think my continue use of them was mostly sentimental. The knives I use were (some still are) my mom's & she received them as as wedding gift. They were expensive, nice knives, but they have aged & it's hard to keep them sharp now.So, after that story that no one really needed to hear, lol, I'll tell you about the Cuisinart set. Even though I mentioned investing in a nice set of knives, these definitely weren't not priced that way. In fact, the price almost deterred me at 1st; I thought good knives could not be that cheap, but I think our brains in the US have been trained to think anything good must be expensive & it's just not always true.I like that these are colored; I can quickly grab the knife I want from the larger ones based on color. Some ppl might want them uniform if they keep them out on display, but mine are in a drawer. They are all sharp, I tested them all when I received them after reading a few reviews that said some were dull. They've cut through everything I've used them on beautifully, raw chicken, bread, lots of melons & pineapple, etc.I like having covers so they can't get beat up & dulled when storing. I used a set similar to these at my sister's & asked where she got them. She sent me the link but they aren't available anymore. I found these & I think they are actually better.I think whether you do a light amount of cooking, or cook larger meals almost daily, like me, you'll like these. There's a knife for everything. They sit very nicely in your hand & have good weight to them.",

                "reviewText": "I love these. This is such a great set and for the price - they are a steal (I got them when they were around $20 I believe - but even at $30ish, I believe they are a good value - the price on these seems to fluctuate so I would keep an eye on it if you want to snag them for less)They wash extremely well in the dishwasher, they are super sharp and the variety is a perfect set for a starter set.I had a small 3 knife set I bought a couple years ago that wasn't that great when I bought it, but had a chef's knife and a serrated blade and a small pairing type blade and it worked for my needs. But I moved into my new apartment last year and that small set of 3 knives just wasn't working as well with me doing more prep and cooking for myself at home. This set gives me enough variety, and enough pieces to do everything I need to do and never come up empty when I need to grab a knife. It has everything I need and nothing I don't.The covers are very nice also just for safety and keeping the knives sharp. I keep them in their covers in a jar on my counter so they are in easy reach when I am cooking and it is a fun little thing on my counter to have basically a vase full of colorful knives out lol.They definitely feel like quality knives and I am going to keep them in as good of condition as I can to ensure they last me a good long while because I like them so much.Really don't have a single bad thing to say about them - unless you count \"please for the love of god learn how to curl your fingers like a claw when cutting things so you don't slice off any of your fingers!\" lol - which I did not say, but my best friend did - about 10 minutes before I nicked myself exactly like she said I would lol. So yeah - they do what they say and they are very sharp, even after several months of use now - so make sure to look up proper knife skills lol.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: 2 years late and this knife set is still holding up. Absolutely no rust and dishwasher safe.HOWEVER we are buying a nicer set because we cook more and these knives aren't good enough. The large knife bends whenever we cut carrots or something hard and I'm worried it will break. Also most of the knives have dulled so cutting things like tomatoes is inconvenient, even though it still does the job. Still A+ for beginners but not for the long term.we just moved into a small condo and needed a basic knife set for cooking meals, nothing elaborate. this is fantastic value! to be honest i only use 3 of the knives in this set but for $25 you can't go wrong. They're very sharp, durable, and easy to clean. The Sheathes make storage very easy too. I am concerned however because when chopping carrots, the blade feels like it bends slightly. If I cook more often I will need a better set. However for chopping meats and small vegetables, this is great!",
