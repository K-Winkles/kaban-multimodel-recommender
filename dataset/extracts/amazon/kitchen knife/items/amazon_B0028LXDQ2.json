They are cheap for starters, very sharp and you will used them a few months and they get dull you hone them a few times. Some do this before each use. until it eventually stops with the sharp edge then toss it and use the next knife in the package... To hone pull the knife across the steel, maintaining a 15 - 20 degree angle until the tip of the knife meets the tip of the steel. Repeat on the second side. Many have those long narrow long bars with a handle that comes with knife sets with the block. Use this if you have it. Some people use two knives but be careful it is very easy to cut yourself. go slow with it. I bought two packs because I knew how good these would be. You can buy the one pack and use my suggestion above to make them last. I bet you buy them again.",

I've had that knife twenty-five years and never sharpened it once. These knives came too dull to even slice apples. It makes me nervous to use them trying as they seem so flimsy I'm afraid the blade is going to snap away from the handle, propelled with just enough force to slice something - just not what it's supposed to slice! Even slicing snack cheese with these seems a risk - and they rusted at the base the first time I washed them, by hand!Not worth the trek to UPS to return them, I'll either try to sharpen them - which might be difficult with the sharpening contraption that I have due to the small blades, or I'll just toss them. I do not recommend this product.",

I work in a professional kitchen and bought this knife to leave on the counter and not worry that someone would damage my $250 Japanese knife.Is it a fine-tuned Japanese piece of steel? - NO.Will it keep a razor edge longer than one full day of work? - No, BUT you should be maintaining any knife with a steel regularly in order to keep a good edge.Is it worth the money? ABSOLUTELY! It is such a good value that I ordered one for a co-worker; we use them everyday.",
