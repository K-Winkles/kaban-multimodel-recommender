Last time I didn't know he left it on the dishwasher and it's fell breaking the tip of my forged chef's knife. So I got his lazy butt this one that goes right in the dishwasher. It's pretty sharp, the edge is put on a little rough but I can even that out. Survived the dishwasher. Partner says it's pretty good but not as good as my knife, but I guess he should have thought about that before he got downgraded to sous chef. .",

The new ones arrived and proved to be razor sharp, so they do require some caution! Paper thin tomato slices, work well on meats and chicken, and having blade covers makes them easy and safe to store. So, far totally pleased with the quality and all at a reasonable price.",

The knives arrived with a nice sharp, straight edges; the metal isn't as hard as you'll get in a higher-end knife, so you'll need to sharpen them regularly, but they're great for the price.The knife covers (sayas) are a helpful inclusion too.",
