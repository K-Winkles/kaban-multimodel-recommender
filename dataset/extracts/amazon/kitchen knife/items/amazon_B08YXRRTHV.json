Makes my prep work easier. Just don\u2019t get your fingers in the way.Update.Downgrade to 4 stars. Yes it\u2019s very sharp but the edge is very weak. I tried to cut a thawed turkey neck in half and the edge rolled badly. Before doing that I noticed a nick in the edge and I hadn\u2019t cut anything hard. Always hand washed it, carefully.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Got this as a gift from my son. I'm not a professional chef, but love cooking at home for my family. As such, I've never owned a knife this expensive, so I was super excited. Out of the box, the knife is absolutely beautiful from the Damascus pattern on the blade to the very end of the handle. The first thing I tried the knife on was a potato. Quite frankly, it was like sliding a hot knife through butter. The knife handle fits very comfortably in my hand unlike most of my other kitchen knives. The handle's shape and location on the knife are such that my knuckles don't hit the cutting board while using the knife. As of right now I am excitedly giving this knife 5 stars - would purchase again. Will definitely update down the road if needed, but so far, this is a must-buy for me.UPDATEJust a quick update. The knife is still awesome! I did have to hone it a bit, as it's my go-to when I'm in the kitchen and even the best blade will start to dull with use. It takes very little effort to put that edge back on and lasts for quite a while. I am STILL in love with this knife and would give an extra star if I could.",
