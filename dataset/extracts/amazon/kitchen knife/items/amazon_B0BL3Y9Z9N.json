It is sturdy, but heavy. Heavier than I expected. Its more like a 2 inch cleaver. Its very sharp. So far only used times to cut onions, cabbage, carrots and does cut through with no resistance. Its a good value",

                "reviewText": "I love this knife! I have seen a few people talk about this knife. I had one before that came with a different set, but it dropped and the handle broke. I was so bummed because that knife was the one I chopped onions and other hardy vegetables with. So I bought this one and wow, it's even better than the one from the set. But be careful! It's so sharp and I accidentally swiped my fingertip across it when I opened it. Guess that's a testament to how well it cuts. Seriously though, it's an amazing knife and works well through really hard vegetables and fruits, like pineapples, sweet potatoes, onions, carrots, and even my butternut squash cut like...well, butter.",
