                "reviewText": "This is a fantastic blade for the kitchen, camping, or wherever you may like to use it. It's incredibly sharp right out-of-the-box. The hand grips are held in place nicely and don't wiggle around. The design looks fantastic on it, and it comes with a nice sheath for protecting it while carrying it around. But ultimately, what I really love that sets it apart from my other knives, it's that little hole up by the handle, as silly as it sounds, that makes it super fun for finger spins, and it's actually positioned perfectly to where the balance is very natural. It's very unique and fun to just play with. I love it, highly recommended!",
