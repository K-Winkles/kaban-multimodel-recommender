If you don't have a sharpening device, GET ONE, 'cause you'll need it for these knives. I still like them, though, but I now have to sharpen them every time I need to use them. The price was reasonable, and they looked good to me, had to have them because of it, but if you want knives that stay sharp a lot longer and are of quality, get yourself some Cutco knives.

Haven't had them long enough to judge durability but they were extremely sharp out of the box and look durable enough. I can take or leave the colorful blades but I can see how they would look good accenting your kitchen. Good value for the money, I would buy them again!",
