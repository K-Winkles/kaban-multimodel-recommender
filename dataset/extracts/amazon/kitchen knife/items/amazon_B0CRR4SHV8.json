I can't speak to that, they don't seem exceptionally sharp. They are holding their edges after a couple days of use, but it's too soon to know longevity in that respect. If premature, I will definately update. They are made in China, which is clearly marked in the advertisement.The holder is nice especially if you want to store in a drawer.",
