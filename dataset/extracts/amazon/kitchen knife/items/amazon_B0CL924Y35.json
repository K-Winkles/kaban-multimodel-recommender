There have been complaints that knives show rust if you clean them in dishwasher so we decided to hand wash and dry them by hand. Only takes a few minutes and have never seen any signs of rust or defects on knives. Knives hold their sharp edge extremely well and have not used the Sharpener yet! I'am sure the sharpener will do its job if needed. If you are looking for everyday Great knife Set at a Lower price try this set. The wife likes the lightness and sharpness of these knifes and the looks are outstanding.",
