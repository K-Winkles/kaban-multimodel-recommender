                "reviewText": "Really like the wooden handle and it fits well in my small hands. Nice and lightweight, but has a good weight too. Nice length and easy to wash. My only complaint is that it's not quite as sharp as some of my other knives for fruit and vegetables. It's great on meat. The tip is definitely sharp. I still think it's a great knife for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I can\u2019t add a picture because it is currently wrapped in Christmas paper. I did inspect the knife when it came in. For such a low price it is a stunning piece of cutlery. I bought this for my daughter she\u2019s currently taking culinary classes, she just turned 18 this is her first kitchen knife. I\u2019m very satisfied with this knife the handle is beautiful, the Damascus pattern is way nicer than in the photos. Don\u2019t judge this knife too harsh for the photos it is truly stunning, the type of steel and the length of the blade are both printed on the blade close to the handle by where a hilt would be. Beyond its look I wasn\u2019t willing to use or test it so I can\u2019t speak to how sharp it is, but if they put so much work into the appearance I\u2019m sure the made sure it was razor sharp. I would highly recommend for a starter knife, I can\u2019t wait to see my daughter\u2019s face. Happy Holidays everyone!",

The knife box was not taped closed, so the knife was out of its box banging around the other shipped items... a piece of tape could've avoided this, seems cheap, but it WAS cheap so I guess that makes sense",
