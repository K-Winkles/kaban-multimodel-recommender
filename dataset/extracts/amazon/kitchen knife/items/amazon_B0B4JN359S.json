The knives cut most veggies and fruits easily. She cuts cheese and some meats too. These are great for teaching knife safety and how to use them properly.

                "reviewText": "I love it. Plus it\u2019s super affordable for that many pieces. This Kids Kitchen cutting set has made a remarkable difference in my culinary space. It arrived with small, medium, and large knives that are equipped with effective grips, allowing for efficient cutting. The wooden knife, in particular, is excellent for my son to neatly chop items in half. The addition of a cutting board is a standout feature that effectively prevents messes during meal prep. Despite being made of plastic, the peeler is surprisingly functional when it comes to peeling apples. The crinkle cutter, though not razor-sharp, provides a unique texture to cuts. For younger children, I recommend removing it initially and taking the time to educate them about proper safety and handling.Also the green knife, which serves its purpose remarkably well. My son effortlessly uses it to cut strawberries and various other fruits. This setup has granted my 2-year-old the opportunity to embrace culinary creativity while remaining consistently safe.As a parent, the idea of letting a toddler handle knives can be unnerving, but this kitchen knife set effectively alleviated my concerns. The inclusion of these heavy duty plastic and wooden knives with serrated edges has allowed my child to dive into the world of cooking without the potential dangers associated with real metal knives. Beyond their safety attributes, these knives hold a striking realism that makes my little one feel like a genuine chef. He thoroughly enjoys the sensation of the serrated edges and enthusiastically \"chops\" his real and play food alike.I saw some reviews where people said they felt cheap, that\u2019s not at all the case. We\u2019ve had our set for a year now and they all are used regularly and appear like new still. The quality of these for me deserves applause. They're solidly constructed with dulled edges, ensuring that my child's hands remain unscathed during usage.What's more, cooking together has transformed into a cherished bonding experience for both my child and myself. Witnessing his joy while working alongside me is truly heartwarming. This product has not only facilitated these precious moments but has also empowered us to craft meaningful memories within our kitchen. Definitely get them asap!",

                "reviewText": "I have an array of knives that are inexpensive and they keep going dull. I have a very nice sharpening tool/stone but it seems like after I use them a couple times, they're dull again. So I decided to invest in a decent chef\u2019s knife. I got this on sale for $14.99 which was quite a bit cheaper than the original price. I was a little hesitant because usually when things get slashed so much, it\u2019s because there\u2019s issues with the product and they\u2019re just trying to move their surplus. But I have to admit that I was pleasantly wrong.I will admit that right out of the box the blade protectors had come off and I almost cut myself. So I would suggest having a coverage for the length of the whole blade and not just a small little plastic piece on the tip or the sharp point closest to the handle. But that aside, the blade is definitely is sharp!I cook a lot of veggies, being a vegan, so the first thing I wanted to test it on was raw onions because I use them every single day. Not only did it slice through an entire solid onion like it was water but I was able to slice pretty close to paper thin slices just holding the onion with my hand and not having to use some sort of a guide. The knife rinsed very well with just a little warm soap and water on a sponge. However, do be careful because I am used to dull knives and this one did slice a piece of my sponge off. LOLI was hoping they had a smaller set of knives so that I could get like a paring knife, etc. but unfortunately - at least here on Amazon - I don\u2019t see that yet. But I don\u2019t see any problem with using this knife for all of my slicing needs.",
