                "reviewText": "I\u2019m a tool guy. I have often researched and tried many edged tools for carpentry, wood carving, camping, cooking, EDC, and just for personal preference \u2013 before settling on a design and specifications that I feel works the best, at least for me. Several years ago, I discovered this Serbian style of chef knife, and found it delightful for all-around kitchen and camp use. This \u201cGrand Sharp\u201d 8-inch model (edge is actually 7 7/8\u201d) is a great fit and exceptional at its price point. Some Japanese- and Chinese- \u201ccleaver\u201d type knives can cost several hundreds of dollars and won't exceed this tool\u2019s utility. It is well balanced, and has a useful edge curve. The 56 Rockwell hardness is perfect for maintaining its very sharp edge. This is not intended to be a heavy meat cleaver; but with its thin profile and attractive \u201chand hammered\u201d appearance, it is perfect for mincing, chopping and cutting ingredients. The leather sheath will go well with my camp gear, and make this a favorite outdoors barbeque and camp chef tool. It does everything a basic chef's knife does, plus it adds extra surface area and spine for food handling convenience. I like it!",
