These knives put the desire in fading hearts whose dinner regiment has become boring, a fantastic desire to Chop, dice, and slice up a delicious meal for the whole family to enjoy. they are beautiful dynamic and ergonomic! Great for singles or families.The knife block is sturdy and streamlined, it doesn\u2019t take up much room on the counter top at all.

These well crafted knives are an elegant focal feature for glam kitchens.

If I was going to give them an award they would get the Glam kitchen award for excellence in design and cutlery.I think the manufacturer of this product really thought of us especially with the bonus scissors, one set can be used for clipping herbs like cilantro and mint outdoors, the other can be used for cutting fresh pasta in doors. Thank you for the amazing glam-gold knives and knife block with sharpener and bonus scissors. Life would be so much sweeter if all products were created as thoughtfully to the consumer as this one, because they thought of space, ergonomics, quality of materials, cost, and in the event a pair of kitchen shears are lost or broken, they included a bonus. Not to mention a gorgeous aesthetic!. Great job!",

When my boyfriend saw what I had done, he cringed because he wanted \u2018manly\u2019 knives that cut things well and didn\u2019t care about how they looked. I\u2019m happy to report we both got what we wanted. Not only are they pretty to look at and don\u2019t take up much room on the counter, but they are also sharp and solid feeling. So far neither of us have any complaints. The one thing I don\u2019t care for though is the built in sharpener. He prefers to use his own sharpener, and I feel like they could have used that space for something else. Maybe a peeler or small scissors for herbs?! Just an idea for the manufacturer to think about. Overall, it\u2019s a great set for the price!",

Even the holder has a very modern look to i and looks great out on his countertop! I am very pleased with this purchase, They also arrived in a very short time in spite of the fact I ordered them very shortly before the holidays.",

While these new ones are a cheaper set than many available, they are sharp and functional; great for our needs to chop meat and vegetables. We are hand washing and drying them. Great value as there are pizza and cheese knives as well, and a built in sharpener. Convenient for us.",

                "reviewText": "I have to say that I really like this knife set. Overall I find the quality to be surprisingly good for a budget knife set. I've had nice, expensive knife sets and for the price this set compares favorably to those sets. The set came nice and sharp and I have found that they retain an edge pretty well. The handles of the knives are not solid and the knives look heavier than they are in actuality. These knives do need to be taken care of and you cannot put them in a dishwasher. These should be hand washed and dried. Although the handles are made of metal, I found that I had no problem maintaining a good grip on them. The included steak knives are serrated. The one issue I have is the built in knife sharpener. I found this feature less useful for me and I would have preferred a steel to the built in sharpener, since I already had a more than adequate knife sharpener. But that's a small niggle. This set looks good on my counter and is very functional and I highly recommend it if you need a nice knife set on a budget.",
