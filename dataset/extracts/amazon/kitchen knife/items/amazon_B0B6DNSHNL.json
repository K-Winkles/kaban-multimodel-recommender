                "reviewText": "I did like the knife overall. For the price, it wasn't too bad, but I could find a nicer knife for the same price in my opinion.That being said, it is exactly what it says it is. It doesn't feel particularly flimsy, it is a large knife and has some weight (though not an absurd amount).The handle is nice, beautiful colors and feels solid. It is certainly not going anywhere.My only complaint aesthetically is the fake \"Damascus\" engraves. It is clearly a Stainless Steel knife, there was no real reason to laser etch Damascus markings. It only looks like Damascus from preeetty far away, but up close it is not so appealing.There is nothing wrong with the etching, I just would rather have had this knife as a plain polished stainless steel blade.It is sharp enough to use for most people's home kitchen needs. Just be sure to read the measurements, and actually take a ruler so you can see what you are getting into. 8 inches is a fairly large kitchen knife.",
