Instructions recommend not putting them in dishwasher which we haven\u2019t done and so far have not had to sharpen them. They have stayed very sharp! Only complaint was with the scissors. The bolt area started rusting after a while and they just broke the other day. The handle cracked and then broke in two. I\u2019m not sure if the lifetime warranty applies to the scissors or just the knives but I\u2019m going to contact the company.I would have given a 4.5 star due to the scissors but the knives and block are fantastic.",

They can be washed in the dishwasher, but make sure to dry them well right away to prevent any spots or staining. I learned this from their customer service which is 5 stars for sure. It is hard to get a solid knife of this quality in this price range and I am very happy I did. The steak knives are much better than some of the bigger name brands we have used. Overall a great purchase and hopefully will last for years to come.",

                "reviewText": "Very stylish and really light weight. Although, I know it\u2019s best to hand wash, but I wanted to find a set that I can put in the dishwasher and this was one of them. I don\u2019t have time in the day and I just wanted a good quality set that could withstand being in the dishwasher use after use. No worry set. I had one steak knife so far in the dishwasher and he had like a rusty spot on it like my last set. \ud83d\ude23 I got it off and since then, been hand washing the set. \ud83d\ude23 I thought about returning but really don\u2019t want to go through and look for another. It took a lot of research and days to finally settle on this set. \ud83d\ude1e Plus side is the knives are super sharp.",
