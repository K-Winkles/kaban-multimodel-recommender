                "reviewText": "Ok...if you are ultra picky about your knives and just can't bring yourself to spend less than $30 (if the 20% discount still applies) on a set of carbon steel knives. Then, you should look elsewhere. And yes, that's right, I said a SET of knives, not just one knife. Of course, I have purchased more expensive knives, and yes, they perform a little better, but honestly, these TOPFEEL knives hold an edge very well. Some of our friends who are former chefs and caterers have used them right alongside our other knives, and everyone is quite surprised at the performance.Honestly, we've found ourselves using the smaller paring knife more that we thought we would. The smaller size along with the sharp carbon steel edge is great for cleaning up chicken breasts or cutting veggies where a smaller blade is more useful. As promised the Santoku knife is great for mincing and chopping, and the chef's knife stands up to our other more expensive knives quite well.If you or your family like to cook and you've never invested in better knives, I'd highly recommend this set. All in all, at this price, what's the risk?",

                "reviewText": "These came quite sharp, but without the taper that I get with a whetstone. After a few months, I have now resharpened them by hand to get the more durable gradual taper that I like on my knives.I do have a few pet peeves about knife usage:-Use a slicing knife with a slicing motion, not a chopping motion.-Use the right size knife for the right job.-Don't use a slicing knife to cut hard things like carrots, raw potatoes, and preferably even onions.With careful usage, knife edges last a lot longer. At the microscopic level, they go dull by getting knicks and chips in the very edge.By the way, note that these knife tangs have a slanted edge, so they insert nicely in a slanted knife block, but not so nicely in a square position. Most knives are the reverse. The positive side of this is that the knife blade and the handle are completely unified and there is a tapered edge between the handle and the blade, all part of one piece of steel.",

                "reviewText": "These knives cut beautifully and I absolutely loved them for probably about the first 6 months. They're still my go-to knives but they're starting to become a pain to maintain. I'm no sharpening expert and I'm sure most of us aren't, so the most I'll do for these is try to run them through my V-sharpener for a few minutes but it's never quite as good as they were out the box. That being said, they've got a good weight to them and they've stayed shiny and beautiful, so for the price I'd definitely recommend buying.",

                "reviewText": "I bought the three knife set while a long-term guest in a house that had no good knives. I'm an avid amateur cook and a bit of a knife junky, and I needed something decent to work with. These knives blew me away. They arrived much sharper than expected, no need to hone them at all. They are sturdy and ergonomic. They balance well. I've used them quite a bit now, and they hold their edge as well as any knives I have owned. I have paid more for lesser knives. I would expect to pay much more for knives of this quality. Seriously, I don't exaggerate in my reviews. These are wonderful knives.",

Maybe it will rust after several times\uff1f\ud83e\udd14 But I want give it a try after reading their reviews.When I received the goods, nice package , shiny knives, you can see the manufacturer's passion.I am so grateful for choosing the right knives set for myself.
