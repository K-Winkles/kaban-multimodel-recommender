                "reviewText": "For less than $25 I bought this as a spur of the moment since I was traveling for vacation and wanted to take some of my knives with me. I was surprised at how robust this was, clearly has room for many knives. Includes a number of tip covers which did have the tendency to come off in transit, but my knives were chip free. Cannot speak to long-term durability, but there was no damage to the canvas bag throughout the trip, so I suspect as long as it's not been excessively abused it should last for many years. It comes with a shoulder strap as well which is a bonus for carrying. The latches on the straps allow it to be tightened down nicely and feels very secure. When unrolling, there was no movement of my knives or the honing steel that I had also put in there. Overall it seems like a great value and recommended if you need an inexpensive but functional knife roll.",

                "reviewText": "I almost didn't order this because of mixed reviews, but on first inspection I think this a great knife roll...I'm not sure what people expect really. It is durable and made from heavy canvas. People have commented that it is shipped folded and appears warn... this is true however, I think this adds to its character. It is rustic looking, but it is canvas and army green at that. It holds 9 knives and has a small spot for a honing steel plus a narrow zipper pocket for tweezers, pens, peelers, or whatever you choose. What I love most about this is it is a true knife roll and rolls up tight. The knives are well protected and secure. I purchased Chef Sac blade covers and they fit perfectly into the knife slots to protect the roll from the sharp knife blades. This roll allows you to either store the knives with the handle in the pocket or with blades sliding into the pockets...both ways work well, it's a matter of preference and knife brand. Either way, I would always reccomend blade protectors no matter what knife roll/bag you buy. This is going to last a very long time. I am a professional Chef and have owned many knife rolls and so far, this is my favorite.",

                "reviewText": "I couldn't be happier. The seller has clearly listened to the complaints some have posted about this economical knife roll. Included with the roll was a bag of 30 knife tip protectors to use when knives are in the roll. The roll is made from heavy, stout canvas with excellent stitching. When received, the roll had no odor and and was clean except for a few errant thread remnants from the manufacturing process. There was one small flaw that had been caught and repaired in manufacturing, leaving a small cosmetic blemish on the inside stitching - no big deal since functionality was not impacted. My knives, ranging from my large 10\" chef knife to my smallest paring knives all fit securely in their pockets. The roll is excellent and should serve me for the few trips that I take each year accompanied by my blades. I will post a follow up if there is anything noteworthy to report.",
