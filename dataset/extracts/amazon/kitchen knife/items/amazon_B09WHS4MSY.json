Shorter than the 17\" long older Wusthof, but not so short as the newer Wusthof one being sold now, and it fit fine in our case. The first photo shows it in our small 19\"x9\"x3.5\" drawer with the empty Wusthof one on the counter above. The second shows the longer knives we have on their side for a sense of how much length they take up, and the third shows how you need to make sure you've got vertical clearance between the top of the biggest knife and the drawer opening (we have 1/2\" to spare). Nice looking and solidly built from all appearances.",
