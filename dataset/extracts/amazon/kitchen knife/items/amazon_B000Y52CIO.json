The blade is very sharp and slight pressure from the handle when cutting meat makes it incredibly easy to cut in bulk and not cause any wrist pain. It will rip up a thin cutting mat or board. But if its a thicker wood or plastic cutting board it won't cut through. Would recommend for someone cooking in bulk or meal prepping.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this after hearing a friend rave about it. Now I know why! You can cut things with one hand, no pushing, pulling or yanking. I cannot begin to tell you how much prep time and aggravation this has saved me! I know some think it should only be used for herbs, but this is a quite sharp knife ready to tackle a wide variety of cutting, dicing, mincing tasks with little effort on your part. I LOVE IT and recommend it to all my friends!",
