Don't just store it wet and expect it to remain in new condition. Could it rust, sure. You also paid like 6 bucks so don't expect the quality of a multi hundred dollar knife. You get what you pay for and for what you pay this is an incredible knife. Stay humble. Peace and love \u2764\ufe0f",

It cleans up super easy and polishes nicely for next time needed. Its handle fits well in my smaller hand grip and its hefty enough to keep control over. It's very sharp. So far.

Frankly, I think any one who has to cook should have a chef's knife.I'm no knife expert so I'm not sure i'm using the right lingo but I'll try to explain why I think this is a great knife. My experience with chef's knives is limited. I only have one other knife which is a really nice (and expensive) 10 inch German Wusthof knife that was gifted to me about 30 years ago. It's still going strong but I wanted to get a secondary chef's knife because another person in my household has decided to use that knife to de-skin and de-bone meat which infuriates me because it was rapidly dulling the edge.Anyway, this product is well made. It seems to be of good quality. The knife is made from one piece of steel which includes the handle instead of having a separate handle. It feels good and balanced when handling and using it. The knife edge came very sharp. Honestly I was worried that a lower-priced knife would be poorly made and dull so I was very pleasantly surprised.I'm sure other more knowledgeable or professional people can expound on the many other great features of this knife but from my lay(wo)man's view, this is a GREAT knife for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this chef's knife. It appears to be made from a single piece of stainless steel, with the transition from the blade to the handle appearing to be seamless. The knife is actually a bit lighter than what you initially think it will be when you first pick it up. The knife came with a very nice edge, and has quickly become a favorite \"go to\" knife when either myself or my wife are preparing meals. So far, after a few weeks of using this chef's knife, we have yet found the necessity to re-sharpen the blade, as it still cuts very well, even after multiple trips through the dish washer.",

                "reviewText": "The most important thing is it's sharp and cuts well. Not sure how long it will hold it's edge, but for now it's great. It's very basic so not something you want to have on display, but I do enjoy the face that it's solid stainless steel so I can throw it in the dishwasher and not worry about the handle getting damaged, and hopefully no rust or discoloration. I know you're not supposed to put kitchen knives in the dishwasher, but I'm a bit OCD when it comes to cleanliness and germs. I won't throw my high end knives with handles made from wood or other premium materials in the dishwasher, so this one will get lots of use from me.",
