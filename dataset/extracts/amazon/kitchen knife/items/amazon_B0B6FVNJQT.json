He has used it multiple times with no issues and loves how sharp it if. I think he has mainly used it on meat so far but has had no issues. I took this thing out of the package when it arrived just to see it as it was one, I was looking at purchasing. I will say it is a beautiful knife. I am one of those people who love a good knife and won't particularly use a knife if it doesn't fit my hand well, but this knife is a keeper.",

                "reviewText": "Heavy knife with good handle. Wasn\u2019t very sharp when it arrived. It was packaged in a plastic bag with some kind of sticky coating on the blade. Took a lot of time to strip the bag off a piece at a time. Still haven\u2019t removed all the sticky gunk on the blade after 4 washes. I\u2019ll have to be more aggressive with thinner Or acetone to get it cleaned off I guess. Good knife for the money but I\u2019d rather have paid a little more and gotten a knife that wasn\u2019t such a pain in the ass to get in usable order.",
