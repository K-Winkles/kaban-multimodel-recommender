                "reviewText": "Ok, after seeing other reviews I have been waiting to find a reason. But, I have to say, so far, so good. These bad boys are sharp as hell. Just like I want them to be. They glide thru what ever it is I\u2019m cutting. Nice handle and design. The hammered steel look is pretty nice added looks. They are a bit off balance and a couple of knives are bent along the length toward the right. The don\u2019t look that far off but you can see it and tell when you are dicing food. We will see if I return them for that.Overall, I\u2019d giving them a try.",

After that, the knives just slide right in and are ready to use! It even comes with a sharpener and a little cleaner brush as well! I used a lot of the knife options the day I got the set to make a dinner for my family and it was so easy to do everything I needed with all the options of knives I had. My mom loved the set so much it\u2019s in her Amazon cart right now! Such a great housewarming gift, bridal shower or even just to treat yourself!",
