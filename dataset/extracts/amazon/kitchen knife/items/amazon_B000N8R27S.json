These German steel beauties are the iconic brand everyone is supposed to want. However, when using another chef's Henckel paring knife, I was amazed at the sharpness and precision offered by this nimble little knife.So, why use a heavy forged tractor for small work when a Ferrari gets the job done faster and easier? These Henckel paring knives make me smile every time I use them. This very affordable paring knife set is highly recommended for the home cook as well as for professional chefs.",

Yes, I know that they're not the same quality as the \"good\" ones that are actually made in Germany. Yes, I know the difference - all of my other Henckels knives are German made and I am very careful with them. But gosh, darn it, sometimes it's just nice to have some stuff you can throw in the dishwasher! I purchased these to replace a set (same thing, colored handles) that I've had for at least 10 years - not because there's anything really wrong with them, but I just need more of them (and to have backups - just in case). My fave is the 4\" paring knife and I always seem to need it when it's in the dishwasher. I am not the least bit careful with these, yet they hold an edge well and are easy to sharpen. The blades are of good quality and not too stiff. This would be an excellent set for garnishing - While sturdy, they are thin enough for fine slicing, peeling and curling. A great deal from amazon -",

                "reviewText": "These knives are very good for the money. They aren\u2019t a forged blade, aren\u2019t german steel, but work very well for what they are. You won\u2019t mistake them for a high quality blade, but are perfect to use as your everyday paring knife. The blades have a bit too much flex due to their thinness, but sharpen easily. They also have a decent warranty.",
