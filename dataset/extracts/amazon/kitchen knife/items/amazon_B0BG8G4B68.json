I wanted to use it daily for a few weeks before I reviewed it but I can say now that I agree with my fellow chef 100%, this is a great knife for the price!!! The look of the blade and handle is absolutely beautiful but of course with any knife it's all about the sharpness, ergonomics and durability. It has a great handle with a comfortable grip, the blade came super sharp and retained its sharpness for weeks of daily use on vegetables and meats. As it is a combination of a cleaver and knife it's ultra-versatile and can be used in any kitchen application. It sharpened easily and continues to retain said sharpness during daily use...and it has a great price! I'm happy to have discovered this product and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking to buy an affordable chef's knife!",
