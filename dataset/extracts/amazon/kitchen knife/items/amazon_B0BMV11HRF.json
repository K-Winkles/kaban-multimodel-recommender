                "reviewText": "I almost didn't buy this knife set due to its extremely low price. How could a complete set of knives be any good at this price point, I asked myself. I decided to give them a try as our much more expensive \"Chicago Cutlery\" set was breaking down after 4-5 years of light use. Upon opening the box and handling the knives for the first time, I was very surprised and impressed with the heft, weight and balance of each one. Compared to our old ones, these felt like a $400+ set. I then assumed they wouldn't cut very well, wrong. After hand cleaning them (recommended by the manufacturer), I cut a very ripe tomato with perfection. We have had this set now for a number of weeks and can't imagine going back to our old set, even if it was new. These knives are that good. There are a few small caveats to note. First, the openings in the storage block aren't exactly uniform, which can cause the knives to rest slightly out of alignment. This isn't a bother for us, but could be for those looking for a perfect presentation on their counter. Second, the angle that the knives rest at are more vertical and require pulling nearly straight up to remove the longer pieces. We had stored our old set under the upper cabinets, but can't remove the longer pieces as the handle comes in contact with the bottom of our cabinets before it is completely removed. Relocating our block fixed this issue, but I would have like to have been aware of it before ordering. Longevity is unknown, but if they last a year, I'll break even compared to our old set. Based on how they look and feel, I expect many years of service.",

Easy to clean and the block is decent. The handles are okay. I like a little bit bigger handles but these are fine. Overall I am impressed with the product considering the price. They are not a high end set of knives but the quality is far better than I originally expected. I\u2019ve been using them for a month or two and have not needed to sharpen any of them. I have another more expensive set that seems to constantly need sharpening. No regrets.",
