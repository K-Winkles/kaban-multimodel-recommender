        "description": "Product Description Experience confidence with each cut. The Henckels CLASSIC 4\" Paring/Utility Knife boasts a precision, fine-edge blade that is honed for long-lasting sharpness. Peel apples, remove blemishes and slice garlic effortlessly - this small, versatile knife is ideal for detailed tasks.With a seamless transition from blade to handle, the knives' fully forged construction provides balance as the traditional triple-rivet handles encourage tireless cutting.Henckels makes essential kitchen tools every home chef needs. From steak knives to spatulas, every product boasts high quality at an exceptional value. Created in 1895 by Zwilling J.A. Henckels, this value-driven brand guarantees the same durability, design and ease of use for which the global company is known. Equip your kitchen with expertise with Henckels. Amazon.com Classically shaped (center-tip style, with curved back and edge), this knife comes in handy at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In the afternoons, when no one is looking, it'll slice open a package. Henckels' International Classic is a moderately priced cutlery line made in countries other than the company's home of Germany. The steel is of lesser quality than that used in its premier lines. Also, the handles are narrower and shallower--which the small-handed might appreciate. While this parer is dishwasher-safe, hand washing is recommended. --Fred Brack",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good little knife, solid value, needs some tweaking",
                "reviewText": "So I recently have bought 4 new knives, three lower end Henckles (NOT Zwilling Henckles which are the good German steel/ two figures in the logo\u2014 don\u2019t compare the Henckles with one figure, those are Henckles and their low end models).This Spain made paring knife shown in the photo is also NOT the same as a Zwilling Henckles German made knife. The handle is much lighter, and the balance on the Spain and India made knives are a bit off and too light in the blade. This is more disappointing in the Classic paring knife as it was $27, which is still less than the Zwilling model/German made blade (about $45 usually) , so this is an actual mid grade knife bc the Spain made knife is German steel, just not the quality German steel. I am, however, satisfied with this Classic line knife. The steel is nice, has a little flex to it, I think it will hold an edge reasonably well. The handle is ok, could be rounded off on the edges some and a be bit larger, but it\u2019s ok. The price is fair for the quality and this knife should last reasonably long, I\u2019d say 15 yrs with moderate use and decent care at least. (Hand wash and dry, NEVER dishwasher, don\u2019t leave it in the sink and sharpen as needed).Now, if you are in the market for just a knock about knife and don\u2019t want to pay much/aren\u2019t looking for especially great quality, the India/Solutions made knife is the way to go. Skip the China/Statement line Henckles unless you literally find one for $5 or less, are fine sharpening it frequently and don\u2019t plan to keep it long. (My good Zwillings are going on 27 years now, and only a paring knife has needed to be replaced due to a tip snapping off, I need to return that to Henckles).Another brand that popped up in my searches was Hammer Stahls, which are tempting bc they are made with the same German steel as Wusthof Tridents (which doesn\u2019t make them the same, but you\u2019re in the ballpark). The HS\u2019s LOOK well designed and made, and you will think they are a deal, but they aren\u2019t. The steel is nice, but the handle has 8 rivets that stick up annoyingly, the handle is too short even for my small hands, and the balance is way off. Horrible, horrible design. Go with the Henckle Classics made in Spain instead. The steel isn\u2019t quite as nice, but the handle build and feel will make up for it. If you must have the good German steel but don\u2019t want to pay Henckle prices, go with the Scan Pan knives over the Hammer Stahls. Scan Pan makes amazing cookware, their knives are reasonably priced, good steel and scored very well in independent tests.TLDR- India made Henckles are a good value for the low price, if you want a little better quality go with the Spain made Classics. Avoid China made/Statement line Henckles at all costs unless you pay $5 or less and have zero appreciation/care for quality cutlery and will just abuse it.Check out Scan Pan knives for a huge steel upgrade, comfortable design, good build, and still reasonably priced. Avoid Hammer Stahl due to extremely poor machining and design/not comfy in the hand, definitely not for larger hands.",
