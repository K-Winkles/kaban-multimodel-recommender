I don't know if there is a quality control issue or what with the reviews saying arrived not sharp, has to be, but the knife I got was absolutely razor sharp. This made slicing through ham, turkey, prime rib, and my finger like slicing through butter. Got it on sale and it was worth way more than I paid. Razor sharp is not a lie. Nice, heavy blade, solid handle. Feels like a very expensive knife. I know it is Chinese made, so who knows what type of QC occurs in the factory, but the one I received, no quest 5 stars.",

I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted another electric one, so while searching for \u201cmeat cutting knives\u201d I saw this one. The reviews were really good and I decided to give it a try. I am SO happy I did! It cuts through the meat like a hot knife through butter. My electric knife never worked this good. I\u2019ve tried it a few times now, cutting both cooked and raw meat ( when I cut my own pork chops) and it glides into the meat so well, that my cuts are so nice and even. It also comes in a really nice box for storage. Definitely recommend!",
