                "reviewText": "I ordered these after seeing higher end versions reviewed on a food programme. My old go-to knife was a stainless steel santoku, which works really well and I will still use for really large jobs. These are work really well for cooking dinner and smaller jobs though as they are much lighter. I find that I need to be more careful with these though, as they are lighter, thinner, and sharper than my previous favourite The extra focus that is required would not aid my safety in a longer usage time-frame such as a big cooking task requires.The nigiri knife (square one) is optimal for slicing and chopping vegetables and fruit, while the other one works better for meats. These push through the food almost as easily as a \"knife through butter\". They actually allow a very thin cut on sturdy vegetables like celery, softer items like tomatoes, and ruffage like Napa cabbage, as well as good small slices on slightly frozen meats.At about 10USD, these are a really good bargain for those that need them or those that are skilled with knives. They are quick and easy to hand wash and they seem to stay sharp as long as I take care of them. I am rating these four stars, as I have been using them everyday for three weeks without switching... though I have been extra cautious and I have narrowly avoided injury. As always, your mileage and preferences may vary...",

                "reviewText": "This is an amazing story. 40 years ago I originally bought the 8 inch, Thai Knife in a Thai grocery store I shopped at. Back then the knives were being sold for about two to three dollars depending on the store. I tapped the blade while holding the handle, it had a nice ring, to me that suggests spring steel. The blade is thin and durable.Two weeks ago My daughter was helping me cook and I handed her one of the knives she commented how she really liked how functional it was. I asked if she had one, she sighed and said she wants one but they are pricey. So I checked. They run from 50 to 100 USD and up. Then I put in the name, 'Kiwi' and found the same knives, and again so reasonably priced. I ordered them on the spot. What a testimony, 40 years of work, and they still handle whatever I need, and stay sharp. The Angled tip allows a spatula use, and the blade is so sharp that I turn a raw, chuck roast on its side and slice it into two or three steaks. (super sharp, be careful) It will chop, slice, cut, anything you cook with.So, 40 years later I bought the same set as a surprise for my kid. What arrived for a good price of about 12 to 14 dollars, was the same exact knives with the same Kiwi logo. I am blown away at this. So why is this knife cheaper? Remember, mine sees hard use, stressful cuts, weighted down, slashes, chopping, and they are 40 years used by me.They may be cheaply priced, but they are not cheap. To say they are not built as well as some, is true, but what does that really mean? Considering I have used mine almost daily for 40 years, and they have outlived my high-end blades that fade into dullness. As you go up toward the spine of most blades, the metal thickens. At that point, one either regrinds the entire knife or buys a new one. This Kiwi blade being thin, is a big factor in maintaining its razor edge.Take care of them, they will serve you perfectly and will be very enjoyable to use..",

                "reviewText": "I cook daily due to food allergies, I have to make every meal from scratch so that I don't get sick.I use my kitchen knife a LOT. and these knives make preparing meals effortless. forget falling through tomatoes these fall through POTATOES like they are made of tissue paper.They are cheaply made and kinda flimsy looking and I had to hone them a little because the blades had small burrs on the blade when I got them. They were very sharp, just not cleaned up after sharpening.,Despite the cheap appearance and unfinished sharpening job they feel solid when you use them and they are light enough that you don't get fatigue when using them for large meal prep.The first time I used these I took my old kitchen knives and put them away, these took over their place in the knife block. They are just that good.Pretty much these are going to be my daily drivers until I break down and get a hand forged set. I have tried lots of knives in the under 50 price range and these just beat everything else I have used. My knife hunt is over until I get a showpiece set, and that just got put way back on the to do list because these work so well.I don't know what else to say, At the price of $16 for the 2 piece set this is an impulse buy that you won't regret.",

                "reviewText": "These are basically a minimalist design for good inexpensive knives.The handles are small and light, but they feel ok and work.The blade is extremely thin. So it can glide through veggies easily. But it has little weight to help in chopping motions. It's thin enough that the blade can actually bend while cutting.The steel is not super hard, so while I haven't had mine long enough to sharpen, I anticipate frequent sharpenings, but likely to be very quick and easy to get sharp. And out of the box, it came very sharp.If you want a knife with substance and heft, this is not the knife for you.We all have price points. And there's a lot of folks for which this price will do nicely.For what the knife is, and can do, it's a fantastic value.For people that can afford knives with more expensive features, chances are they want something more substantial.",

Deshalb konnte man mit diesen Messern, obwohl h\u00f6llisch scharf, keine Zwiebeln schneiden, da sie sofort anfingen zu rosten und die geschnittenen Zwiebeln dementsprechend aussahen. Nun habe ich diese Messer aus rostfreiem Stahl entdeckt und bin absolut zufrieden. Die Messer kommen mit einer guten Grundsch\u00e4rfe an, die f\u00fcr alle Arbeiten in der K\u00fcche ausreicht. Wenn man sich jedoch die M\u00fche macht und noch ein paar Mal \u00fcber einen feinen Abziehstein geht, gibts von der Sch\u00e4rfe keinen Unterschied zur Rasierklinge.Ich bin absolut zufrieden; die ganzen teuren Messer in der K\u00fcche werden von mir kaum mehr benutzt.",
