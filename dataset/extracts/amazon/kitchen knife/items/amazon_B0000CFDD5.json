                "reviewText": "Although a bit disappointed that it is not as stiff as my 8\" Victorinox blade, I was pleasantly surprised that because the b lade is thinner, it easily slices pretty much everything very well. The handle, despite its plasticky feel, it is effect a very comfortable and fit in your hand, causing you to feel secure and allowing for nice accurate work. Over time, I am finding that I no longer rely on my Chef's knife as much, as more and more cutting tasks are transferred to this nice knife. NOW, ABOUT THE FLEXIBILITY. I was hoping for a stiffer blade and wonder if I can use it in hard cuts like carrots, or hard squash. It is very light weigh, so power really has to come from you, which may scare some people.",

                "reviewText": "This is almost exactly what I was looking for. A 6 inch blade, with a great finish and REALLY sharp. I also like the plastic handle because I know it will last a lifetime. And it is pretty darned thin at the spine, which makes it great for cutting hard vegetables.I purchased this knife for those jobs that I don't want to pull out a large chef's knife. I don't find an 8 inch chef's knife to be particularly useful (especially those with a thick spine), so a 6\", in combination with my (thin-spined) 9\" Japanese chef's knife, is perfect.Did I mention it's really sharp? Among the sharpest I've seen straight out of the box. This seems to be a core characteristic of the Victorinox knives I've bought recently.This knife (and all Victorinox knives I've purchased so far) is a great value for the quality of the blade you get. While it's a stamped blade, it rivals some Japanese brands in quality and fit and finish.Recommended!",

Only used it for about 30 minutes total so far and it still cuts great. I do wish it had a bit more room between the handle and the cutting board though.",

                "reviewText": "Perfect size for just about any kitchen work with a very comfortable handle, as with any Victorinox they are very easy to sharpen and keep sharp compared to many of the usual European traditional knives that we have had over the years but after getting a Victorinox for Christmas from my daughter many years ago we gradually replaced all eight knives as they so easy to maintain and comfortable to use. Four years ago I came back from Japan with a very expensive similarly shaped kitchen knife to this one, beautifully made and incredibly sharp but we always seem to end up using the Victorinox at a tenth of the cost and performs the same, the beautiful Japanese knives require more care as its easy to chip or break the edges and a more sophisticated sharpening technique.",
