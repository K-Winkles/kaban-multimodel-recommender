                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. For the price these are very good. Nice curve at the bolster for control, good blade shape, nice heft and fair balance.There are some minor issues: - The larger and smallest blades both have ever-so-slight bends to the blade, you can really tell unless you look straight down the blade. The bend is right at the bolster. However, I've seen this a lot in many blades, some more expensive than this. And it's not so bad that affects the performance in any way that I noticed. It was just dumb luck that I even checked and saw it, I usually don't. - The spots where the handles meet the bolster/pommel have some minute imperfections. Visibly they're almost impossible to see, but when you run your hands over them they can snag ever so slightly on the skin. I trimmed them down with a nail file and they're better. Didn't even mar the wood or metal. - It's hard to tell if these are full tang. The tang (part of the blade that goes down the handle) is not visible once it hits the handle, and there are no rivets. I had a knife like this where the metal pommel (the metal piece at the base of the handle, opposite the blade) popped out after a few months. I'm concerned that might happen with these. BUT it hasn't yet, so it's hard to judge against, I wouldn't take points off for that alone. The lack of rivets and visible tang, however...So, despite these cons, these are very nice knives, and the scissors work pretty well too, did some testing with them and so far they seem pretty handy. As you can see in my video the large one came needing a little sharpening, the little one came pretty well. The bread knife, well, it cut a loaf of bread just fine. Overall they look *very* nice and I will eventually probably gift them to someone just moving into a new place and needing knives, but isn't too picky. Like, I wouldn't give these to a picky knife person or a professional chef. But for average, everyday cook, these would make a good gift. For the price point they're a solid 4/5.",
