                "reviewText": "If you dream of removing the knife block from your countertops, this will work for you. It should fit in a small drawer, although we put it in a wide drawer. It fits all of the knives perfectly (shown in the picture, two knives were taken out to show empty spaces). If you need 8 steak knife slots, they do sell a different version. However, I worry about the functionality of that one due to its same dimensions. You might need to read some reviews. This is the best thing I\u2019ve done for my kitchen (and sanity) in a while!",

                "reviewText": "This bamboo tray was the perfect organizer for the 18 knives that came in my knife block + the sharpener. Not only does this help free up much needed counter space, it also makes it safer to grab a knife without playing the \u201cwhich knife is where\u201d in the knife block. Large knives on the bottom tier, steak knives on the top tier\u2026 perfection! AND much cleaner than having the knife block on the counter getting dusty and cooking grease splattered all over it.",
