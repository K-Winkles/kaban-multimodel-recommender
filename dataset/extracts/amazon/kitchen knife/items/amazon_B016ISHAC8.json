Covered in elegant, satin-finished, high-grade stainless steel, our classic knife block has a fully magnetic surface powered by strong magnets with a sophisticated look that effortlessly compliments your home d\u00e9cor.

These are much better than peg boards for holding tools. Strong magnetic retention. For the kitchen, they are magnetically attached to the fridge. Easy to use & removable for cleaning. For my work benches, they are attached with screws. Use caution when installing because they are strong magnets. Highly recommend for function and appearance.",

                "reviewText": "The frustration of cramming my assortment of knives into the limited space of my fork and spoon drawer finally led me to seek an alternative solution. This led me to discover a magnetic knife holder that revolutionized my kitchen organization. Crafted with a robust magnet concealed beneath a sturdy steel covering, this holder showcased its practical brilliance. The knives found their place effortlessly upon its surface, and what's more, they remained exactly where I positioned them.Beyond the evident organizational benefits, this holder offered a distinct advantage in preserving the condition of my knives. By ensuring that the blades didn't come into contact with other utensils or items, the holder effectively shielded them from potential dulling or damage. This thoughtful design significantly contributed to maintaining the sharpness and integrity of each blade.The installation process further demonstrated the holder's versatility. Opting for the drill-into-the-wall expansion anchor method, I securely mounted the holder in place. The result was a visually pleasing addition to my kitchen setup that seamlessly combined form and function. The holder's sleek appearance and its ability to effortlessly corral my knives not only elevated the aesthetic of my kitchen but also streamlined my cooking routine. This magnetic knife holder had indeed proven to be a remarkable solution, offering a blend of practicality, preservation, and aesthetic appeal that I thoroughly appreciated.",

                "reviewText": "This looks great in my small kitchen and serves a couple of purposes:1. I have limited counter space so getting rid of the knife block helps open a little more space up.2. It keeps the knives farther out of reach of the kid.Both huge pluses!Install was easy, I mounted two separate bars in a corner (see pic) and used the supplied hardware to mount to my drywall. The drywall anchors included are not the best, but your typical little cylinders. I usually use my own anchors but for this, they seemed to work out pretty good. They aren't holding a ton of weight, so I wasn't overly concerned and they are not pulling out from the wall. The actual steel bar magnetically attaches to the mounting bar/bracket - this is a very strong adhesion! Watch your fingers! You'll know what I mean if/when you go to install it. This bar has plenty of magnetic strength, so you don't have to worry about knives slipping down or anything like that. It takes a little force to remove your knives - but I'd argue this is just the right amount. Not too strong, definitely not weak. I had originally thought about mounting directly on the underside of my corner cabinet (so the knives would basically be hidden and parallel to the countertop), and while I decided against that, there is plenty of strength if you choose to do so.The only con I have is that some of my knives like to turn/angle a bit on the magnetic knife bar, as opposed to staying straight up and down. I am still messing with the order of the knives a bit, and it seems that some spots do this worse than others, I assume because there are a series of magnets (maybe they are round?) within the knife bar itself. It is worse with smaller knives, compared to larger knives with more steel/wider blades. Of course, when writing this most of my smaller knives are dirty from prepping dinner, so the typical culprits are not in the pic I attached.Overall I'm happy with it so far, and the wife likes it too (minus some of the knives angling a bit). She hated our knife block, so this was my remedy for that, the price was right, and I have to say, it looks pretty sharp.",

Hung vertically the knives have to hang at an angle with the handles stopping their movement, but we only wanted to hang 4 large knives, so it fits what we wanted. We mounted it with Gorilla heavy duty tape, which would support up to 9lbs for this 18\u201d magnet. With the knives, total weight is ~5.5lbs and seems to be holding great. Definitely recommend",
