                "reviewText": "I bought 2 blocks intending to gift 1. Ended up keeping both because the finish was identical and when side by side both blend together perfectly looking like 1 large knife block. Finally have room for my 7 inch cleaver, 8 inch chef, and large nakiri getting them out of the drawer and at fingertips with the rest of my knives.More than enough slots to store complete set of knives when bought as a set.Even though it has quite a few larger knife slots, it still has too many small slots. Essentially 12 steak knives or pairing knives. Wish designers would realize that a 1 inch wide blade can fit into 2 inch slot but a 2 inch wide blade cannot fit into a 1 inch slot.Ended up keeping the second block as I have many wide blades from individual purchases and was still short 2 slots to keep them all together with just 1 block. *This is a problem of my own making and does not take away from the quality of this product.* Luckily I have the counter space and 1 corner that is out of the way to store both. At least now the blocks match seamlessly and drawers are free of large knives. Guess I'll have to order another to send as a gift.This is a quality product that looks elegant on display. The name is visible, but not offensively in your face like some others. It can store large wide knives, and leaves room to expand your set if desired. The dimensions are made available to know if it is right for you. Just remember to measure ALL your blades.I definitely recommend",
