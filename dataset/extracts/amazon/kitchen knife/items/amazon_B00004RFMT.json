        "description": "Product Description Experience confidence with each cut. The Henckels CLASSIC 8\" Chef's Knife boasts a precision, fine-edge blade that is honed for long-lasting sharpness. Chop potatoes, dice apples, mince shallots and slice salmon effortlessly - this kitchen workhorse is up for almost any task.High-quality German stainless steel strengthens this durable, Spanish-made knife. With a seamless transition from blade to handle, the knife's fully forged construction provides balance as the traditional triple-rivet handle encourages tireless cutting.Henckels makes essential kitchen tools every home chef needs. From steak knives to spatulas, every product boasts high quality at an exceptional value. Created in 1895 by Zwilling J.A. Henckels, this value-driven brand guarantees the same durability, design and ease of use for which the global company is known. Equip your kitchen with expertise with Henckels. Amazon.com A good chef's knife becomes your daily kitchen companion. It's used for everything from prepping steaks for the grill to finely mincing onions, and chances are you'll reach for it every time you cook--so it better be good. This lower-priced line from Henckels is a great value: excellent quality knives with their standard lifetime warranty. There's good balance, and the handles are a shade heavier than other lines, which some cooks will prefer. The 8-inch blade length is the most practical for multipurpose use, and regular sharpening will keep the stainless-steel blade razor-sharp. It's only minimally flexible, which makes it a great choice for vegetables such as potatoes and turnips. While it's dishwasher-safe, unless it needs sanitizing after use with raw meat, it's often easier to hand wash. --Jill Lightner",

I was very leery about ordering this for the same reason, but did my research and these are the real deal. The difference was obvious as soon as we got it delivered too. This knife is unbelievable! I've never seen craftsmanship quite like this before. WOW! Worth the money and if you can get one while it's on sale DO IT!!! We got a great deal on ours during Prime days around the holiday and I think we saved 40 or 50 % of what these go for. The knife is incredibly well balanced, sharp, and makes food prep so enjoyable! This knife in particular is a perfect size for my husband, he's pretty tall, and this fits in his grip well. It's really a well made, durable, and beautiful knife. I think we'll be ordering this brand in perpetuity. Like I said, if you can get a good deal - don't miss out!!",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE:Henckels just updated this listing with a knife that is NOT the one I just purchased or was given thousands of good reviews. The previous knife listed was the 'Classic' series chef knife, the best in their lineup.The knife they are listing now is the 'Statement' series chef knife. A cheap, Chinese made product that isn't worth half the price.Figured I'd post this to inform anyone who reads this review.ORIGINAL:I purchased this to use at work and not worry too much about what damage I or my co-workers do.Although, not as refined or premium as a Zwilling knife and not made in Germany, it is a good bang for your buck and works well in professional kitchens. Keep it honed and sharpened when needed and I'm sure it will last many years.Note: The bolster helps with handling but will make sharpening a challenge if you're using a whetstone.The steel blade is still good quality, despite being a tad thin.The factory edge passes the paper test and can trim your arm hair although it could be sharpened a little better on a stone. Didn't feel any burrs.Weight distribution is pretty balanced.My biggest gripe is that the handle is a little too large for my liking and could be a bit more ergonomic for the palm.Also, I don't feel any silicon coating despite being told by Henckels support it has some and I've never been a fan of plastic handles, although it's not some cheap handle that will break if dropped from the usual height.It is full tang, forged, and triple riveted. Given the Amazon deal right now, it's a fantastic knife for around $50. You can't go wrong with this blade at that price.Made in Spain",

The sale price was great, so I rooled the dice and am happy to report i received the Classic knife.Nicely weighted, traditional handle, extremely sharp out of the package. I have a bunch of these and have been very pleased overall.",

Also came packaged in that molded cheap plastic packaging that's impossible to cut. Definitely lost some of the luster of ordering a nice knife when it arrived like that. Other than that knife is really sharp and nice. We love it.",

I looked up a lot of reviews and articles etc. before going with this knife and I am really really happy with it. My bf loves it. He uses it for everything.There's still some resistance when cutting a butternut squash or something like that but it has made preparing food SO MUCH EASIER and SO MUCH SAFER. Plus, I can cut tomatoes without squishing them!",
