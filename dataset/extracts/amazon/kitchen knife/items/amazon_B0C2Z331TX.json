                "reviewText": "This is one of the best cooking knives I've ever used. It's very very sharp, strong and glides through anything with ease. I've used to to cut some of the densest and driest things out there. Sandwhiches, porkchops, terribly dry chicken, and even a turkey. It went through everything like I was trying to cut paper on a razor sharp blade. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't come with anything to store it. Unless you have another knife block or an open spot that can fit it, you'll have to keep it in the box in the foam, which to me isn't the most sanitary thing. I would recommend this for anyone who cooks and needs a good knife, but they really need to include something for safety since it comes so sharp.",

A few pulls on a steel, and a long pull through the beef, and had a nice deep cut. (Yeah, I have other knives better suited for this kinda work, but I had this knife for several weeks, and just had to try it on something worthwhile!) The knife comes packed in a very nice box, and would make an excellent gift, if you have friends who will take care of their knives. I wouldn't give this to someone who uses a butterknife as a screwdriver...",
