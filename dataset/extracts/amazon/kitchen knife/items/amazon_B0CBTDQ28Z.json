                "reviewText": "The knife arrived in a handsome box with magnetic closure - will I keep the knife in the box? No, but it makes the knife feel more special than other knives I have purchased. My main cooking knives are Zwilling J.A. Henckels Twin Select which are very good knives (in my opinion). My cheap knives are also Zwilling J.A. Henckels, but the Motion series. There is no comparison between the two Zwilling sets - the Twin Select has thick blades and is predictable and maintains and edge, while the Motion series is thin blade, flexible and I've cut myself more times than I care to admit.Why all the info about Zwilling knives? I place this Hoshanho knive squarely between the two in quality. The blade is thicker than Motion, but thinner than Twin Select (T.S.). The handle feel and weight is better than Motion and inferior to the T.S. I would have preferred real wood handle, like many Japanese knives - but this doesnt look bad, just not my preference. I do enjoy the 'Damascus' pattern on the blade, but keep in mind this isn't the result of recapturing the lost art of Damascus forging, but artificially recreated. Nevertheless, it still looks good. The blade is sharp and has a quality feel throughout making me believe it will sharpen nicely, when the time comes. I will include this Hoshanho knife in my rotation and hopefully reduce the number of cuts suffered by those stupid Motion knives.",

                "reviewText": "Absolutely lovely. This knife is a well made product. The Damascus steel look is gorgeous. I\u2019m not an expert on this type of forging. This knife says there are 65 folds in the little engraving on it. It\u2019s likely a machine made product now instead of done by hand, but still, it\u2019s striking and beautiful. The folding process does make a very hard strong knife.The packaging is superb and impressively classy. It\u2019s highly giftable.I love the handle of this knife. It\u2019s not wood, but it\u2019s smooth and doesn\u2019t feel slippery. Wood is classic and beautiful, but for knives it\u2019s only one option that works and holds up well. This seems to be really well made. It\u2019s a very comfortable handle, totally ergonomic and natural for my hand. It feels very well balanced heavy enough without being too much weight.The blade cuts wonderfully. It\u2019s super sharp, and the curve of the blade is just right to get the job done with a nice natural rocking motion.I\u2019ve been grabbing this knife a lot lately to do various cutting jobs in my cooking. It hasn\u2019t failed to make me happy.I\u2019m not an expert on knives, but I have been using a well sharpened very large decent quality chef\u2019s knife for years. I\u2019m not professional fussy, but I dislike cheap department store quality for a tool I use this often. I will keep this very sharp knife in good condition, and it seems like every time I put it away I have to just get it out again\u2026it will likely live on my cutting board most of the time. I love this knife. I really do.",

                "reviewText": "Pre-review notes: I do not assess value - you can see how much it costs, and you can compare it to other products on and off Amazon. Value is a personal grade - if it's worth it to you, it's worth it. Also, I am no expert on expensive knives - all I know is what I see on the TV show about forging. All that said, this is one beautiful knife! Very sharp right out of the (classy gift) box - seriously sharp. I have a bunch of chef's knives of varied quality and cost - this one out-slices them. I cut up its shipping box - it sliced through the cardboard like it was a tomato. And then I sliced up a tomato - wafer thin slices with no grabbing or crushing. Sweetness! Cutting cardboard is abusive, so I took it to my sharpener; but only the final fine step. Didn't need it. This knife came out of the box sharp and honed - still is. I don't know if the blade is genuine Damascus steel. The pattern seems a bit too regular - and is the same in every picture I've seen in other reviews. But I don't really care - it looks great in my kitchen. Recommended!",

                "reviewText": "This knife is plenty sharp and well balanced. I have 0 idea what the handle material is made out of... It has a square print on it that could be from the texturing of the handle, or it's a 'printed' wood alternative. Either way, it works.I cannot validate if it's true Damascus or not, sorry :( But it's a great looking knife either way. I did what you shouldn't do, and ran it across a sheet of paper and it cut cleanly through with minimal effort. Using it on chicken and beef was a dream, and easy on tomatoes and veggies.Only time will tell how well the blade will remain sharp. With any nice knifes I recommend using a wooden cutting board, so you don't risk damaging the edge.I'll follow up if anything happens, but for the first week using it multiple times daily, I'm happy with it.",
