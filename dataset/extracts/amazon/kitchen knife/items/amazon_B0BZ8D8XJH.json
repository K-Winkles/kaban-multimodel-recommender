                "reviewText": "Update: I just had to revise my review from 4 to 5 stars as their customer service is AMAZING. They reached out to me to ask how I liked my product. I have them my honest review and explained that the base was cracked. They replied within 24hrs and sent a replacement that I received I. Just 2 days!They didn't ask for a return, they were kind and very professional.The new set is in perfect condition!Cons:1. I wanted to love the base of this knives set so much; however, the corner is cracked and the job fell off.2. Even when I put the knives as pictures I struggle with 2 of them to get them in and out. A bit frustrating.3. Washing is a delicate process. You have to make sure you dry them well or they will rust. (So not sure they are true stainless steel.PROS:1. These knives feel and look amazing.2. The knives are sharp! Making cooking easier.(Has sharpener as well)3. Omgoodness, the scissors work so well. Plus you can take it apart to clean it properly!4. WOW the peeler is NO Joke. It really takes the work out of peeling. It's sharp and you can peel in both directions!!!5. The base(even though it was cracked) really is beautiful and makes access so much simpler.6. The knives are full body, the handle is part of the actual knives. It has a smooth rubber-like coating for a better grip Which is amazing.7. The knives are a well built without feeling too heavy.So overall, still worth the price!If your looking for knives in a pinch, these seem like they will last a good long while. (So long as you DONT PUT THEM IN THE DISHWASHER OR LEAVE THEM IN THE SINK.)DRY THOROUGHLY AFTER EACH WASH GUYS. They will last a long time that way.",

I guess I just needed the ride to review as fast as possible because that annoys me so yeah just be careful you might not get everything you think you're going to get or the colors you really wanted. After trying the knives, they are very cheaply made, flimsy handles are plastic and feel like the knife blade and handle are ready to break in a matter of time, i used a steak knife 1 time and the tip has scratch marks on it. going to return this asap",
