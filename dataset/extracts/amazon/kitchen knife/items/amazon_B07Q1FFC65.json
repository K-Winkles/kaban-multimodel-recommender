I ran it thru the included ceramic sharpener, a few strokes, which smoothed the edge and made it sharper. How it holds that edge remains to be seen.",

He loves it! It\u2019s super sharp, has amazing weight distribution, has a very pretty design, and cuts amazingly. Warning: Do not use the hand sharpener! Those sharpeners will mess up your knife if used incorrectly (it is very easy to use a knife sharpener incorrectly), this one included. My boyfriend and I knew that\u2019s before buying, so that didn\u2019t matter to us. Get a normal knife sharpener and use that. Made a great gift! He uses it all the time.",
