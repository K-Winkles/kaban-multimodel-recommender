                "reviewText": "This is a great knife set for the price point. They are very sharp right out of the box & additionally come with a knife sharpener to keep them sharp. The set includes some nice extras like a cleaning tool for the blades, a pizza knife, a cheese knife, a finger guard, & a peeler. The display looks impressive, but the one thing that I could see changing is how the blades sit in the holders. There is a small gap between each row and it\u2019s easy to accidentally put the knives in that gap if you aren\u2019t looking straight down at it. This could lead to a larger blade hitting your countertop. Additionally, having a forward tilt would be nice as well, since you have to pull the whole holder out to put a knife in, or take one out, but that\u2019s just personal preference based on where I keep my knives under the upper cabinets.",
