                "reviewText": "I was not enthused about having my knives setting out on the countertop, in their holder, as I noticed dust, etc. collected there. I do want my knives CLEAN!! I am delighted with this drawer -located knife holder mat. I have even discovered I can park my kitchen scissors in this holder. There is plenty of room for my eight knives and two pairs of scissors, with four of the knives being large ones...a perfect solution for keeping my knives and scissors clean and off the countertop.",
