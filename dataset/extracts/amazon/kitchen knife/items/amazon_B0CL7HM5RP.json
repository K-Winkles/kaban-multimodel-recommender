It could cut things pretty thin as well, I did struggle to get a paper thin cut from what I tried, but I got very close to it. The design of the knife is also really pretty, love the colors of the handle, and the slight curve near the blade makes it easy to grip",

The grain of the burl wood is stunning, and looks great in contrast with the marbled blue resin.The balance of the knife is slightly weighted forward, which contributes to the ease of cutting with it. The handle is very comfortable in the hand with smoothly finished metal components.The blade is very sharp, and passes the \"arm hair test\". It also easily slices through a taut piece of paper.The length of the blade is, in my opinion, the ideal length for a chef's knife.The forged Damascus steel blade has an attractive pattern. I also like the mosaic design of the rivet.The knife comes beautifully gift boxed, and would make an ideal gift for yourself, or for anyone who enjoys cooking!",
