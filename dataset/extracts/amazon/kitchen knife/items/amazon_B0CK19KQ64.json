The blades are stainless steel, so they will stick to a magnetic knife strip. However, the protective sheath covers will have to be removed first. Does the paint chip off of the blade? No. You have to scrub them too hard.",

They are just a vibrant and detailed as they appear in the product photos.As beautiful as they are, if they don't work well I won't use them so I set out to put them through a rigorous test. I made stew, chopping & peeling various carrots, potatoes, celery, onions, & of course Beef. I used all of the knives in this preparation so that I could test them all with the exception of the bread knife which I used to slice a nice big italian crunchy loaf. I also used my tried and tested favorite knife that has been with me through thick and thin on the first cut of each food item so that I could judge how they did compared to a knife I know works well. They ALL performed better than I'd expected and shocking to me they also performed better than my favorite knife. Even when cubing the roast I'd chopped up for stew meat they performed Excellent, again beating my old favorite. These are definitely a 5 star rating in my kitchen and although I'm not ready to get rid of old faithful yet, he's going to be resting for retirement inside the drawer while our new knives take on the kitchen.",

The handles of the knives are a silicone type material, which makes them easy to grip comfortably and prevents them from slipping out of your hand while using them. The ones I have had a chance to use have been super sharp, and cut through veggies and meat very easily. The bread knife is the only one that seems a bit iffy to me. It has a bunch of \u201chooks\u201d (only way I can think to describe them) which don\u2019t really seem sharp. It seems like they will just tear up your bread. The included plastic covers for the knives seem to be of good quality, and stay on the knives with no issues while being stored. I am a little concerned about how I will sharpen these knives when the time comes in the future. I have a stone for that, but I assume using it would remove the floral designs. I wish some instructions were included regarding the best way to sharpen them. I would recommend these overall, but hope the seller will provide some clarification about how care for/sharpen them on the product listing or in the package in the future.",

                "reviewText": "I think the idea behind this floral set of knives is unique but not very practical. As steel knives need to eventually be sharpened, running these blades against a honing steel or through a knife sharpener will wear against the floral pattern.As far as quality, this set is lacking. Some of the smaller knives are very thin and bendable. As a whole, these knives are not as sharp as one would like a knife to be for safety and efficiency. The bread knife has no sharpened edges/ teeth and tears through a loaf, not giving clean cuts.The silicone handles are of decent weight and there are color coordinated sheaths for each knife, but that's where it stops for me.At first glance, I thought that this set would be a lovely idea for a bridal shower, housewarming, or hostess gift, but after using them, I wouldn't recommend it. Other than looking cute, this knife set is a no for me.I posted some photos to give you a closer look and hope that they help you out a bit with your choice. Thank you.",

I am enamoured with my new set of flowery knives!",

Overall, I would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Do not let the pretty flowers fool you, these knives are very sharp! I have been in need of some new, sharp knives for quite some time! I have basically been using butter knives (dull cutting knives), to cut through tough meats, fruits, and vegetables. Imagine my shock when I slightly cut myself, while cutting ginger, with these beautiful new knives!I love the flowers in these knives and the different colors of each knife handle. Also, each knife comes with it's own protective sheath. As you can see from my photos, I tried these knives out on pineapple (the turquoise handle knife cut through the pineapple like butter!), lemons, and ginger. It has been years since I have been able to slice lemons like this (in actual slices)!As wonderful, helpful, and sharp as these knives are, I do have one concern. I was a bit upset that this kitchen knife set did not come with a list of instructions or better yet, a list....specifying WHICH knife cuts what? Forgive my ignorance but, not everyone is familiar with every piece of cookware and cooking utensil. These are very sharp knives and it would be wise to be able to know WHICH knife to use to cut a particular item. Using a knife incorrectly, can cause serious injury! I took photos of the handles (front and back) of one of the knives to show that perhaps, the name or \"knife type\" could have been written on each knife, for the consumer.Again, wonderfully sharp knives however, I was disappointed not knowing which knife is used to cut what???",

The handles have a slightly gripping texture to keep your had from slipping during use.
