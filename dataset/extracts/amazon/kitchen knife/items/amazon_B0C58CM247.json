Anyways, it came very sharp, it\u2019s a great size and well balanced. For the price, not too shabby.",

                "reviewText": "This is well made but not my favorite knife in the drawer. The blade is heavy and sharp but it has a coating on it to help keep it from rusting and it is really hard to get off. Also the top half of the blade has some sort of cosmetic design on it that makes it more attractive to the eye but interferes with easily keeping it clean by providing an uneven black surface that debris can collect and hide in. The handle is round and slightly tapered. This isn't comfortable for my hand as it tends to allow my hand to work its way towards the blade as I use it. Also it seems to dull quicker on my cutting board than my Cutco knives. This knife misses the mark for me",
