                "reviewText": "Very nice magnetic knife holder. Bought the 12\" version and works great. Mounting solution is great, but does require a drill if you want to properly install onto drywall. You need to drill the correct sized pilot holes for drywall anchors. Double sided tape (not included) could be used, but the magnet is so strong, it'd probably rip the tape off the wall should you need to remove the main part from the mounting plate for whatever reason.The separate mounting plate design does have an advantage. Longer knives tend to swivel around a bit on the holder depending on its weight. You can pull the magnet mount off the mounting plate, wrap a paper towel around it, and put it back onto the mounting plate. The paper towel will give enough friction between your knife and the holder to keep it locked in place. On a white wall, it doesn't look too bad either.",
