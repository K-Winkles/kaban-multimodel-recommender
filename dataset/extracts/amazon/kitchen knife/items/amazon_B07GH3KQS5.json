Indeed, the paint particles that color your hands can end up in your food, as even after washing the knives extensively for a couple of times and leaving them to soak in dish wash for long time in the second wash, the handle narrow edge near the blade still throw black color on anything rubbed to it.2- Worse (foreign material in your food): The damascus pattern paint layer chipped off because of rust at the sharp edge of the blade and fell off.3- Bad: Nylon remains on the blade is trapped between the blade and the handle, and almost impossible to remove fully.4- Bad: In reality the handles look genuinely fake and poor resemblance of wood.5- Less bad: be careful of the upper edges of the knife, as they are still sharp because of the manufacturing cut. The must be fillet, or at lest chamfer to the upper edges of the plate...............................................................................................................Recommendation: For the price, the knives are good, however, to avoid the black color issue of the handle, probably the other colors that have texture imprints of the same knife set are better...............................................................................................................Important Notice:The knives are made of high carbon steel for extra strength and to retain their sharp edges. However, you need to be careful that unlike stainless steel knives, these will naturally rust/corrode if they care kept wet for long period of time. So maintain them dry and clean ASAP when not in use.",
