The knife's larger blade provides ample coverage, allowing me to spread condiments evenly across the bread with a single stroke.

                "reviewText": "Best little knife I've ever used! Beats all my other smaller knives (expensive or cheap!) I've ever had!!! First got this knife through a brick and mortar store on clearance. Couldn't find it anywhere locally after using it. Even my neighbor said it was the best little knife she'd ever used. Ordered it through Amazon paying double what I'd paid before. WELL worth it! The serrated edge makes it useful for slicing tomatoes, hard boiled eggs, ham, or any lunch meats in blocks. It keeps the stuff I'm slicing intact and not shredded or crumbled. LOVE this knife. Word of warning: VERY SHARP! Cut with care!",
