                "reviewText": "I ordered this set to try out as most of my knifes are pretty old and not only in need of a good sharpening but some also needed replaced. (lose handles etc.) I wasn't expecting much but boy was I wrong. This is a really nice set of knives that are super sharp and there is a great variety of knives for the kitchen to choose from in the set. So far I have used every knife in the set and I am very impressed on how they perform. The only complaints I have are the handles seem a little light and were a bit rough but really nothing affecting the use of these at all. They were still plenty comfortable to use and control with no issues and the roughness after a couple washings with a scrubby pad was completely gone.Overall I'd say these are a terrific value for what they are and worth much more that what they are being offered for. Now I just need to make a knife block to store them in. Definitely recommend these and they are budget friendly.",

                "reviewText": "These knives are incredibly sharp and easily cut through all the meat, veggies and fruit that I tried. They even cut thin slices of tomatoes with ease. The knives feel balanced in my hand when I am using them and are lightweight enough that I didn't feel like I was straining while holding them. I like that the knives and handles are all a single piece - it gives the knives a sleek, uniform look and I won't have to worry about the knife and its handle separating later. It does say to hand wash these knives, which I do with all my knives anyways. This is great set, especially at this price. 10/10 I would recommend.Review of: Vvwgkpk Kitchen Knife Set, 5Pcs Knife Set with with Integrated Ergonomic Handle, High Carbon Stainless Steel Japanese Knives for Multipurpose Cooking, Chef Knife with Gift Box",

I'm a little put off by the fact that these are not dishwasher safe, but it's not that big a deal. I'm waiting on magnetic knife holder or I'd show these hanging out on the wall. I used the Santoku knife in the set to do my prep cutting for curry. I thinly sliced two quarts of mushrooms, diced an onion and cubed up four big potatoes, added meatballs, coconut milk, massaman curry for a really good Instant Pot dinner! Wow. The Santoku knife can cut, they aren't kidding when they say it will cut a potato like butter! That is completely true! I'm happy with this set! Thankful also getting these for a good price helps these days too! Thank you! -Mike",

                "reviewText": "These knives are built with the handle as part of the blade. It appears as though they are all one piece in design. They are very well balanced, not too heavy, and quite sharp. They feel good in the hand, and work well. Also, because of their high carbon stainless steel, they are magnetic in their properties, in that if you have a magnetic knife storage block, these knives will stay firmly attached to it. The set includes: 8 \"chef's knife, 8\" bread knife, 7\" Santoku knife, 5\" utility knife, and a 3.5 \" paring knife. By the way, these are not meant to go in a dishwasher. Personally I never put cutting knives in the dishwasher, because they will get dull very fast from the abrasive action of the detergent and water. Overall, this is a very nice set, and at the time of writing this review it was reasonably priced too.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Yep, sharp knives. I was skeptical to order these knives as I have used Wusthof knives my entire life. My parents had Wusthof, I went to culinary school and invested in Wusthof knives and am 42years old. It\u2019s the only knives I\u2019ve known. However I ordered these out of curiosity and for a set at our farm shop. I didn\u2019t want to invest in an expensive set in the chance they go missing. I\u2019m pleasantly surprised. Very!High Carbon Stainless Steel that come very sharp. I used the Santoku knife first. I do love a good knife with the divots in the blade (granton). This keeps food from sticking and you can keep chopping as the food falls to the side. The handle felt a little big for my petite hand but nothing I can\u2019t get use to. These are very lightweight also.The next size up is the 8\u201d chef knife. Great for conquering larger tasks. The bigger the product the bigger the blade. The paring knife, utility knife & bread knife are all going to get regular use for more basic cutting. The box says only hand wash & I would second that.This is a nice set, comes well packaged with plastic sheath & knife guard & box. This would make a nice wedding gift.",
