The all-rounder 8-inch chef\u2019s knife is perfect for everyday kitchen tasks like chopping herbs and dicing onions. The versatile 6-inch utility is ideal for precision work in-hand or on the cutting board. And the 4-inch paring knife is for smaller cutting jobs like peeling vegetables and segmenting fruit. TWIN Signature knives are precision stamped from a single piece of special formula stainless steel, resulting in lighter weight knives. Combined with ZWILLING\u2019s signature ice-hardening technique, these FRIODUR\u00ae blades will stay sharper, longer. To ensure an ideal cutting angle, the sharp laser-controlled edge is finely honed and hand-finished. The ergonomic, triple-rivet handle embedded with the ZWILLING logo provides durability and balance. And these dishwasher-safe, German-made knives are conveniently easy to clean. Set includes 4-inch paring, 6-inch utility, 8-inch chef\u2019s knife.",
