                "reviewText": "Everyone should have one of these! While it's edge could easily be honed; the ergonomics, balance, weight, and geometry are perfect on this beast of a tool! The back edge is falsetto and completely smooth to the touch affording you many grips. I ground my tip to a dual edge since I seem to have a manufacturing error on my point. I might later grind the falsetto edge out to be sharp up to the thumb spots. This is one of my favorite Amazon purchases of all time! Just don't expect the sheith to be worth a darn thing to you other than protecting your edge and steel from dulling or rusting during storage.Pro's: The overall craftsmanship of the steel, blade, and handle on mine are superb, the knife itself is a steal for the price. It's beefy, sharp, and extremely ergonomic in a variety of grips with a fine finish on the wood and rivets of its handle (which are soft and comfortable to grip.)Cons: The edge was not what I would consider sharp out of the box, but the steel takes and holds an edge nice. My point needed some grinding to take shape. The sheith leaves a lot to be desired, but covers the edge at least. I didn't take any stars off because this thing rocks!",
