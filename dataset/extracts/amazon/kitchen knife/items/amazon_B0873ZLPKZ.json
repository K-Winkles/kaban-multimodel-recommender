                "reviewText": "Spectacular knives! I bought these for my daughter and son in law because their kitchen knives are deplorable! I\u2019ve been staying with them to help with their small children and so far I\u2019m the only one who has used these knives, but I absolutely love them! I definitely plan to get a set for myself, my mom, and my other daughter and son in law!I shopped through knife sets for several hours before settling on these. One of the biggest selling points for me was that they didn\u2019t come with steak knives or in a tacky block! My daughter has very young children whom are very active and curious. She keeps her sharp implements in a childproof drawer, not on the counter, so a countertop knife block would not work. As for the lack of steak knives, I appreciated that this set did not include them. I was looking for quality cooking knives, not service knives. So many of the other sets I considered came with 6 steak knives (in order to market a 15-piece set, I suspect), which aren\u2019t necessary in my daughter\u2019s home, and detract from the true value of the overall sets.I love that these knives are simply cooking knives without the fluff. The handles are comfortable to grip, ergonomic and lightweight. They are razor sharp too! They came in a lovely gift box that is worth keeping! And they\u2019re just beautiful and so wonderful to work with!Love the lifetime warranty and the very attentive follow up customer service after purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I have used dull knives for at least 28 years. Growing up I was sawing potatos and anything that needed cutting. I finally decided at the ripe age of 39 I was going to buy some knives. I didnt want to spend 3oo dollars though! I took a risk and order these knives AND THEY HAVE CHANGED MY LIFE! Never knew that I could literally just slice through a potato before! THese knives are amazing and at an amazing price. they are also beautiful. The handles are really smooth so it is difficult to get a good grip if your hands are greasy in any way (from cooking or too much lotion). They also have a smooth edge which means you can get most of them sharpened (except for the small serrated knife). Totally worth it and want to gift them for my mom one of these days. She is still sawing her vegetables:(",

After many uses and washes the only thing bad I would say is that the handle design/paint is starting to chip off a little. However, the actual blade quality has not changed since day one. Very happy with this set and I wished they also made scissors for the kitchen.",

The only downside is they don't hold the edge very long. After sharpening they keep the edge for a little while, usually long enough for me to finish what I'm cutting that day but the next time I need to use them I have to resharpen them. Other than that, these are excellent knives, well balanced and ergonomic. I'm very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for professional qualityat an affordable price.",

The blade covers are great but you definitely want to take all safety precautions with these!Happy slicing and dicing!",
