I wanted a decent GREEN COLOR salad knife so my romaine lettuce and bok choy would not turn brown after I cut it. This knife does NOT do well with the bok choy. Cutting through the romaine is a bit easier but it could cut through it better! Consider another knife if you haven't purchased this yet.",
