                "reviewText": "I read the reviews prior to purchasing and I was a bit concerned about the multiple complaints about a missing steak knife. I really loved the black set so I figured, I would just contact Amazon or the company if there was anything missing. After receiving and putting the knives in the correct slots, I thought I was missing a knife too, but I wasn't. And I'm almost positive nobody else is missing a knife either. There are 6 steak knives in the set. 3 on the left and 3 on the right. Not 8. That 7th knife that looks like a steak knife is the tomato knife. There are 19 pieces total. THAT INCLUDES THE KNIFE HOLDER. Once you put the knives in their correct slots, there appears to be an empty slot between the steak knives and the knife sharpener. But if you put a knife in there, it will not sit right. That's not a spot for a knife. I hope this helps previous and potential buyers.The knives are beautiful. I haven't put them in the disher or let them dry in the dish rack. I wash them and immediately dry and put them back in their slot. They are very sharp. I honestly didn't realize how dull my knives were. I haven't needed to sharpen them yet but I would be concerned that the color will chip. I've had them for a few months now and only one knife has a small chip.",

                "reviewText": "I loved the look of it as you can see all the pieces without having to remove them first and it's a cute design, doesn't take up much space. I would've given 5 stars except that, I gave this as a Christmas gift to my son and when he opened it, one knife was missing. I then discovered that I couldn't order the missing knife as you're not allowed to order one piece, and this was a huge disappointment to me. I cannot understand why you should not be able to order if there was a missing piece when it arrived, so for that it took away some of the value for me, and my son said for him, it wasn't worth the hassle of returning it.",

Definitely recommend. The price is also awesome.",

Can cut things easier now and more smoothly.However, the peeler isn't the greatest, so I don't use it. The \"Cheese\" knife seems gimmicky and shouldn't have even been offered. The steak knives are decent at best. Also the \"block\" that holds it is only ideal for really open spaces. Under a cabinet, forget it. I have 40 inch cabinets with a 36 inch height counter (8 ft ceilings) and I can't remove a knife without tipping the block over. Annoying, but your mileage may vary depending on your kitchen style.Overall for $50 it's hard to beat and they look great. It's a good knife set for budget conscious individuals or families.",
