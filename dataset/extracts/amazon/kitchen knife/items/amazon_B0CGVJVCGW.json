                "reviewText": "This was purchased as a gift but after I received it, it looked too cheap to give.. It\u2019s probably not a bad price for it because it is sharp and I like the design. It would have been better for more money to be spent on a presentable box and leave off the cheap sheath. I will just use it myself as a kitchen knife.",

                "reviewText": "Wide blade, comfortable handle, very sharp. The blade is about 200 mm (8\") long and 47 mm wide at its widest point. Makes chopping stuff up a real pleasure. It comes in a very posh presentation box, together with a sort of thimble gadget to go on your finger for use as a sort of guide when slicing. Just bought a second one as a present for a friend setting up house!",

Ovviamente, come per tutti i coltelli di questo genere, occorre averne una certa cura. Rapporto qualit\u00e0 prezzo secondo il mio personale parere \u00e8 decisamente a favore della qualit\u00e0.
