The ergonomic handle is comfortable to hold and the balance is spot on. I've used it for chopping, slicing, and dicing and it performs flawlessly. The gift box is a nice touch, making it a great gift for any home cook or professional chef. I'm impressed with the quality and value for the price. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a reliable and sharp chef knife!",

I was able to cut into chicken breast but after that it was pretty dull. The knife has some weight to it which makes it feel super durable and sturdy. I have sharpened it and since then it has cut through a lot! I have cut through chicken leg quarter bones, frozen meat and veggies. Overall it is a decent chef knife, just not super sharp.",

                "reviewText": "The knife is value-priced and this lessens a lot of my minor quibbling about it. So what are the quibbles? Well, there are lots of small flaws, like little scratches all along the blade, as if the maker didn't take the time to polish it well at the factory. Along the choil (the top part of the knife which does not make contact with food), there are some minor chips and at the middle where the choil meets the handle there is an off-centered pin hole. Also, the blade arrived dull, dull, dull. It could not chop through an apple without a lot of force applied - though to be fair, the knife's somewhat thick and the geometry works against it in use cases like this. I spent about 10 minutes with my whetstone and it got a lot better.I liked the balance point of the knife and as I said the price is very appealing. With some work, the knife is a good tool for actual use. It is not one of those beautiful, expensive pieces that people collect. That said, if you're not prepared to sharpen the knife yourself do not bother. This Bykooc chef knife is rather poor-performing out of the box.Would I recommend it? Well....perhaps not. There are lots of knives on Amazon that are finished better around the $10-$15 range. This was a fun impulse purchase. Let's leave it at that.",
