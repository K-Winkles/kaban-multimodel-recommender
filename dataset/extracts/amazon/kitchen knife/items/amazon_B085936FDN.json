We already kept them in the drawer, but needed something more robust. The measurements were accurate and the knives all fit comfortably. The block is well made and does the job. Super happy that it also fits our steel.",

I was tired of the knife block on my counter & I have a wonderful Japanese knife that didn't have a spot, so I purchased this during the Cyber Monday event & received it the next day! It fits my unique knife, a long with all of the knives that were in the knife block. I do not have 'steak knives' from the set, so the smaller 'paring' knives go in the spot where steak knives should go. It is made of bamboo & quite sturdy. It measures 9\" x 17\" - top to bottom. Highly recommend!",

This is a great product, easy to use and seems well built, the only downfall is that there are a couple of slots that are too tight that I cannot use them for any of my knives. Thankfully I had just enough open spaces to fill with what knives I do have so those two spots really are not an issue unless I purchase more knives in the future. But the satisfaction of having these off of my counter and be so well organized is a great feeling.",
