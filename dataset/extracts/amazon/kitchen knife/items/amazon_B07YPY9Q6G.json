                "reviewText": "My knife collection in my kitchen is full of German steel, Wustof, Henckels, Zwilling, so that bar is pretty high when I started looking at this Chinese brand purporting to make Japanese knives. That said, some of these Chinese foundries have gotten better over the years, and the price was right to get something interesting like a Gyoto (similar to a French Chef's Knife).Suffice to say I've been impressed after a couple of months of use. This has been a fantastic knife that's held up well so far. It's very sharp, and seems quite durable, and has been easy to clean. It's also quite striking, friends and family have been impressed by the knife, and it's a great addition to my collection.While you generally shouldn't run knives through the dishwasher, it's actually less about the metal (modern knives should be able to handle high heat of the dishwasher just fine, though I wouldn't recommend it), this knife has a wood handle that will not hold up well in the dishwasher. Fortunately the stainless steel cleans easily, just hand-wash your knife immediately after each use, treat it with a knife steel, and then put it away. Cared for like any other good knife, and I really think this knife will last you a long time.",

                "reviewText": "First off, I'm NOT a professional cook, but I used to work as a prep cook for a Cordon Bleu caterer. So while I'm not a professional, you could say I'm a well trained amateur.TL;DR? It's a great knife for the price, if you're interested in spending a little more for a knife than you're used to, but don't want to shell out over $100.The knife arrived in a lovely wood box, and as many have already said, was very sharp. The feel of the handle is quite nice, though if you're not used to the octagonal handle commonly found on Japanese cooking knives, it might feel sort of weird. After giving it a light washing, I decided to try it out on a variety of foods. The knife absolutely flew through veggies I prepped for a salad, and later when I was getting some salmon ready for dinner, the blade glided through as though it were melted butter. I've been using it regularly now for about a week, and for the money, it's excellent. I also own a couple Wustholf knives including an 8\" kitchen knife from them, and my 8\" FAMC\u00dcTE is certainly almost on par despite being less than half the cost.The not so great? Well, after just this short an amount of time, not even two weeks, it's dulled a little faster than my Wustholf, but a quick bit of honing was all it took to regain its edge. The other issues I have are minor, but if you use your kitchen knives a lot and you're used to very high quality, you'll notice. For one thing, the balance is WAY off, as in the center of weight is almost an inch and a half up along the blade. The other issue I've had is in the way the blade is shaped. Most kitchen knives I've used, the bottom portion of the cutting edge leading toward the heel will straighten, so while much of the blade has a curve leading to the point, that last 1-2\" of the heel toward the bolster will be straight. This blade doesn't, and curves all the way to the bolster. Not really a huge issue, but when using a rolling chop I've found I have to adjust how I'm used to cutting to make sure I go all the way through.So all that said, I like it, and I'm likely going to try some of their other knives. I have yet to need to sharpen the blade, but so far I doubt I'll have any trouble.",

There was bubble wrap around the box that it is sitting in & came in a cardboard sleeve around the top portion of the knife in plastic. This knife also cuts extremely well! Overall I would recommend this knife to anyone!",

I wish I had purchased the full set as I love matching sets of things but honestly this and the paring knife would be more than enough. I am always sure to hand wash and hand dry it immediately. No rust or dulling.I remember shopping for this knife and doing a lot of research for days before I finally purchased this one. Glad I did.",

I've honed and sharpenee it myself, it holds and edge beautifully and if taken care of will last you a long time.I firmly a believe a knife is only as good as the effort you put into caring for it, and this is just a great knife.I do say that the knife is a little bit front heavy, so if you arent fond of rocking or chopping then this knife probably isn't for you.All and all, I would put it up with my higher quality knives in terms of longevity and edge retention.
