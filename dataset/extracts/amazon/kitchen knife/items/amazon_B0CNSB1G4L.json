We needed to find some way to slow down and put our health first, all without sacrificing convenience or taste. Could we somehow create healthier versions of our favorite foods, easily in our own kitchens? The answer was a resounding yes, and NutriChef was born.",

This knife being cordless, makes it so much more convenient for me to use regularly. I like not having to deal with maneuvering a cord around while I\u2019m working. Best of all though, I don\u2019t have to be near an outlet to use it. I can use this by the grill for slicing brisket, for slicing bread at the table, etc. It is a great knife and very sharp. I had actually never tried using an electric knife for slicing bread before and it is so great! It does all the slicing work for me so I don\u2019t end up smooshing the loaf. I highly recommend trying it. Anyhow. This is a great knife. Really convenient to use. The battery lasts a long time and the blades pop in and out easily for cleaning and storage. The knife comes with a compact storage case to keep everything in one place.",
