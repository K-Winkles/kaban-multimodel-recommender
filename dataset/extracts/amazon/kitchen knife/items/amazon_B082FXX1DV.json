I\u2019ve been looking for a way to get my knife block off the counter and away from my toddler.While this knife holder is pretty big, I wish it was slightly larger for my drawers. My other complaint is that it doesn\u2019t hold some of my longer knifes like a carving knife.I\u2019ve used the smaller slots for pairing and petty knives so I\u2019m still looking for a better storage solution for steak knives.I\u2019m also curious about how the bamboo will affect the knife edges and sharpness but no complaints yet.Overall, good value for the money and a proof of concept so far. It may lead to a custom number later on.",
