                "reviewText": "I invested in the Amazon Basics Stainless Steel Comfort Grip Knife Set, and my kitchen experience has been nothing short of wonderful. This 18-piece set is a complete arsenal for all your culinary adventures. With each knife designed for a specific task, it's like having a professional kitchen right on your countertop.The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek design and the comfort grip handles. These knives not only look gorgeous on my kitchen counter, but the grip is so ergonomic that chopping has become a less tedious task. The brushed stainless steel handles offer a secure and comfortable grip, making the knives easy to control even during demanding tasks.The high carbon stainless steel blades are the stars of the show. They are stain, rust, and pit resistant, which is a testament to their durability. With a satin finish, they glide through ingredients with ease. The variety of knives in this set is impressive, catering to all kinds of food prep tasks like chopping, cutting, slicing, peeling, and much more.Now, while the knives are sharp and ready to use out of the box, I did notice that they might need frequent sharpening with heavy use. The good news is that the set includes a sharpening steel, so keeping the blades sharp and ready is not a chore.The rubber wood block that houses the knives is compact and stylish, fitting well in any kitchen setting. The set includes a chef's knife, bread knife, ham knife, santoku knife, utility knife, vegetable knife, paring knife, sharpening steel, and eight steak knives, all neatly organized in a rubber wood block.The affordability of this set is a cherry on top. It's a budget-friendly option without compromising on quality or functionality. The Amazon Basics Stainless Steel Comfort Grip Knife Set is indeed a valuable addition to any kitchen. The quality, the range of knives, and the price point make it a commendable choice. I highly recommend this set to anyone looking to upgrade their kitchen game without breaking the bank.",

                "reviewText": "My old knives were a popular brand and very expensive. They did not hold up after 5 years of home kitchen use. They literally fell apart\u2026so\u2026I began a search for a sharp, durable knife set that didn\u2019t break my budget. The reviews on these knives seemed positive and the price was right so I decided to purchase them, not expecting anything great.Well, these are seriously the best knives I\u2019ve ever bought! They are seriously sharp! So sharp that you need to be VERY careful with them so you don\u2019t cut yourself. I sliced a whole watermelon in under a minute with one very arthritic hand. They\u2019re THAT sharp!These knives are one solid piece so you know they will not fall apart at the handle. They\u2019re also very lightweight.If you\u2019re looking for sharp knives that actually cut, that will not fall apart or break your budget, these will be your new best friend in the kitchen. The knife holder is sturdy and attractive and the scissors are of good quality as well. It comes with a sharpener that fits into the knife holder so that is real handy as well, although I don\u2019t see myself needing to sharpen these for quite some time.I am super impressed and happy with this purchase and I highly recommend them.",

                "reviewText": "Nice knife set! Had it one month, will update in the future. ULTRA sharp, be careful! The blade steel thickness is not a thick as the Henckel but its still pretty sturdy and does not flex on the chef 8\" knife. The steel seems to get a brushed finish fairly easily when I use my ScotchBrite pad to clean them and I thus believe the steel is softer and will require sharpening more often. I believe they use a shallow angle on the factory edge, so although ULTRA sharp now, I expect it to be more average on resharpening unless I can replicate the shallow angle well. It's a very complete set and the wood block is nice quality, size, etc. It's a great set of knives for the money! It would make a nice gift for sure!",

So I am assuming their life may not be for 10 years. But if you are looking for a medium time span of 5 years or so, I dont think anything comes close to this if you put price in consideration.",

I don\u2019t mean that as a disrespect to them, they cut great, but I have used a professional set of knives in the past that we\u2019re not mine and there\u2019s no comparison, however for just anyone\u2019s kitchen these are awesome.",

                "reviewText": "These knives are not as sharp as I thought. When I first got this, I tested it out on a honey dew. I used the biggest knife it came with. It cut like butter at first. As I kept cutting, I noticed it got more dull. Even with the knife sharpener that comes with it. I've only had this a couple of weeks so no way it should be this dull. I still feel like I'm sawing to cut basic stuff, and I have had to resort to my old knife. The only reason I gave it three stars is because the kitchen scissors work really well. Also, the smaller knives seem to cut better than the bigger ones. I onions and cucumbers with the smaller ones and I got a better result than with the bigger one. I would not recommend this product.",
