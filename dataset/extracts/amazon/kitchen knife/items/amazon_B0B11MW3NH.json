Like all knives of this grade, it will take a bit to keep them sharp but the simple sharpener is fit to purpose. Throw in the polishing cloth and nice box and this is perfect for someone's first apt, or the weekend cabin. A nice housewarming gift for the kid who really needs to learn to cook!Be aware though, you can't just throw these in a drawer, you'll lose a finger. Make sure you have a magnet or other block to store them so they are safely put away.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Initial look, mostly good. Here's the first impression",
                "reviewText": "This set is low priced for the apparent quality, but rated good enough to get me to buy. The packaging is nice, but unless you're gifting it, that's now why you buy it. The workmanship seems pretty high. Sharpness- I always test, usually with the capacity to slice a free-held piece of copy paper.These knives will, assuming you use the right motion. I'd rate them sharper than most knives of this price.These are relatively heavy, robust tools. The one thing out of the box that concerned me was that the back grind, the top of the blade, was ground off square as it should be- but not dressed on the corners. That edge was like the sharp edge you would put on a scraping took; sharp enough to damage you if casually hit your hand, of other things it might come in contact with. All three knives were like this, but the largest and heaviest was especially so. I got out a diamond sharpening bar, and dressed those corners down. The interesting part was that this also gave me a read on hardness, as i was literally trying to put a small radius on those edges. It took a lot of work to get them to the point they no longer felt sharp, but still I wasn't to the point where I could see any radius, I could just feel the sharpness was gone. I think if you buy these, you should plan on doing that. That tells me this is very hard steel. Good for holding the edge, but sharpening takes a lot more effort- and a good way to do it. A trade off. However this set comes with a sharpening tool, that may be up to the task, we will wait and see.Overall, exceptional quality & high vlaue for the price paid. Now, with my wife coming back from a family trip, I'll find out If the boss approves too.",

                "reviewText": "For the price these are exceptional knives. I\u2019ve been a professional butcher for 45 years. I\u2019ve had A LOT of knives. Now that I\u2019ve retired I spend a great deal of time in the kitchen cooking. Butchering knives don\u2019t lend themselves very well to cooking. I wanted a set of chef knives. I saw these and figured I\u2019d try them out. They came today. Although they come sharp a few strokes on the sharpening steel gave them a razor edge. The steel they\u2019re made of is quality and the handles are tight and comfortable to hold. They are packaged in a quality box suitable for gifting. They are an exceptional value.I am looking forward to using these knives.",

They come very nicely packaged and have a good amount of weight to them. The included sharpener works great and keeps these already very sharp knifes in top shape. Best purchase I've made in years.",
