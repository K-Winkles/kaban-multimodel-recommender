They are chisel ground, which I was not expecting, but not a huge deal. It's probably written somewhere in description that I didn't bother reading. They relatively sharp right from the box and it only took me around 10 minutes a knife to hone the edge to my liking.The knives are flexible, light weight, and small. I find them to be fine to hold on to and plenty easy to manipulate and manoeuvre. My biggest complaint is using a bamboo, wood, or any cutting board makes them go dull rather quickly. Also, the thin plastic handles will crack and break easily if you abuse the knife or as it ages especially if you put them in the dishwasher.",
