        "description": "Our new series of kitchen knives, the Kitchen Classics, will race through just about any task you can imagine. These blades are ice tempered and then precision flat ground for maximum cutting power. All models in the series come with a razor sharp edge that lasts and lasts, and some have serrated edges uniquely appropriate to the tasks they were designed to do. The handles are, in a word, terrific! Carefully designed to ensure a strong, secure, yet comfortable grip, they feature a stiff Zy-Ex core on the inside, with a softer, deeply checkered Kray-Ex exterior for a the kind of non-slip grip that must be felt to be appreciated! The Kitchen Classics are available for purchase as single items or as a complete set. The set includes an attractive counter-top oak stand, and one of each [except for the Steak Knife, which comes in a group of 6] of the knives in the series.",

                "reviewText": "I recently acquired a Cold Steel machete based on the Japanese short sword with a tanto style tip, and was duly impressed with the workmanship and sharpness of that tool out of the box. I've been preparing a lot of vegetable based meals for my family, involving red cabbage and root vegetables. The pairing knives I have (both serrated and non-serrated) have not been adequate for the task, so ordered this 6 inch serrated utility knife from Cold Steel, and couldn't happier....it made easy work of a large red cabbage.....just sliced through it like butter. For the money (around $14), I doubt you'll find another kitchen knife that's better for slicing vegetables. The sharp blade and ample handle makes this knife a winner.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good, general use kitchen knife that you will find becomes one of the \u201csurvivors\u201d. That is to say, 15 years from now as you are rummaging through your kitchen/Utility drawer you will find it and it will be one of the few utensils you still have of that age and from that era. It is rugged, sharp and will last. There are 2 reasons I only gave 4 stars. This knife was bought to be a secondary back up to a Cold Steel K7 kitchen knife which I bought about 20 years ago (see what I mean), but the K7 has a 7 inch blade and Cold Steel doesn\u2019t make the K7 anymore so I had to settle for this 6 inch version. My photo compares the two knives. The other reason for the deduction of a star is because the K7 came with a sleeve which the knife has always been stored in, but this 6 inch knife has no sleeve, it is just a loose knife in the drawer. However as to the function, durabilty, ergonomics and value - I would give it 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "This is the most useful knife I've ever had. I use it to cut boxes (it works better than a box cutter,) slippery fruits and vegetables, and to carve pumpkins every Halloween. If you have too many useless knives, then you want this one to replace them. My only complaint is that the blade is on the thin side, so you have to be careful when cutting into tough vegetables like pumpkins or pineapples. If you put too much pressure on the blade, it can bend and slip.",

It wasn't until I read reviews of satisfied buyers of this product, that I decided to give it a try and let me tell you, it is GREAT!! It slices though any food item so easily! In fact, it's very dangerous item to have around so if you do end up purchasing it, make sure it's stored in a safe place away from little hands and fingers. But yes, this is just what I needed for my cooking. I had enough fustration trying to cut with cheap dull knives. This one definetly does the trick. No more heaaches. I totally recommend it.",
