The points on both sides are really sharp and have to be watched out for when Remove from the sheath. It is very light weight also. Cant say much for long term durability, but it feels like a good little knife so far. Update, i sharpened the knife using ceramic dowel rods and it is razor sharp now. Very hard steel",

I played the Amazon cutter market, and purchased 4 Huusk kitchen/camping knives (touting ATS-34 steel) and a couple cheaper high carbon blades of copied design. All of the other blades came at least out of the box sharp. This blade, as many of the reviews stated, was, simply, unsharpened. I'm not saying dull...I'm saying I could not see any tooling marks on the edge, and there was no bevel. The edge was blunt and could not open a paper envelope. As well, the whole \"of Japan\", \"by Japan\", \"in Japan\", etc, description is complete and total bunk. These are ALL Chinese! You get that for which you pay! I kept all these knives because they were perfect for trashing around my property, and I knew how to keep them sharp enough. Don't purchase ANY of these knives unless you are proficient in high carbon steel care and sharpening.",
