                "reviewText": "At last! Solid, inexpensive knife sheathes to replace my embarrassing paper bag hack from when we moved. Very happy with purchase, and at this price point I was even willing to replace my paper bag, since it seems I'm never going to get around to getting a larger knife block (we used to have a magnetic strip on the wall to hold some knives).Pros: \u2022 Solid plastic holder with a nice grippy texture on the outside, so even if your hands are wet, it's grippier \u2022 Interior is some kind of soft coating to make it easier to slide the knife in, which works well \u2022 The angled opening on one end makes it very easy to get the knife blade inserted for sliding in \u2022 Easy to slide in & out, it was not overly grippyNotes: \u2022 The shape of the knife blade & connection to the handle makes a difference in the fit. My inexpensive workhorse, a Dexter 8\" blade, has no pretty shaping of the blade near the handle, so the sheath stops only when it hits the handle. This means if I insert the blade fully until it stops, the very tip of the knife sticks out about 1/8\" and I need to back the blade up a bit so it doesn't stick out. However, my other fancy 8\" blade that is weighted has a flare on the blade that stops the sheath earlier, and the tip doesn't stick out of the sheath at all. \u2022 To make this a \"true\" universal fit, it'd be wise for the sheath to be designed to accommodate the worst-case scenario of having the handle be the stopping point - just 1/4\" longer probably would have done it. I debated docking a star, but these are SO inexpensive I don't think I should ding them for it. Also, it'd be really nice to be able to purchase an 8\" and a 10\" version. \u2022 I cut down the 12\" sheath so I'd have two sheathes that fit my 8\" knives. I was able to accomplish this by slowly & carefully scoring the plastic with a box cutter (my other thought was to try the chop saw but I didn't feel like firing it up). YMMV on modifications. But it worked well! Plastic was not brittle, which means I can use the modified sheath for my inexpensive blade so that the tip won't stick out, as I cut it with space to spare.",

                "reviewText": "These are a simple idea, pretty well executed. Plastic guards with a velvet-type lining that you can slide the blades of kitchen knives into. They are easy to use and hold to the blade reasonably well. By that I mean that you can pick the knife up and the guard won't fall off, but I would not use these to then throw the knives into a backpack and expect them not to come off. SInce the blade can come out the entire back of the guard they are really best for protecting stationary knives in a drawer.The textured look outside is printed into the plastic and provides a nice amount of grip to the sheath. Since it's easy to remove, there's little risk of struggling with the cover that could lead to accidents when handling the cover.Keep your knives clean and dry when using these sheaths and they should last a good while. If you get anything into the velvet lining I would worry about how to get it out.The size assortments are a little puzzling, but I happened to need to cover two knives that were pretty close to these sizes. The large cover is on a 10\" chef's knife, so it's a little larger than it needs to be. I noticed that the 5 piece assortment of covers does not go up to the 12\" size. So pay attention to your knife sizes when selecting your set.These sheaths are an inexpensive way to protect your blades and your fingers if you just have some knives in a drawer.",

                "reviewText": "Edit: The seller fixed what was most likely a typo in the original item description that indicated that there were two of the 8.5 inch sheathes included. I bumped this up to 5 stars as the misleading description was the reason I originally gave the low rating. I'm going to make some changes below as they're no longer relevant.Two nice sheathes. These are pretty nice and super handy, I had been using folding cardboard, and these certainly look a lot nicer. They're just plastic, but are sturdy and look great. These also have have a soft lining to keep from scratching the knife and are good value for the price. My only complaint is that I wish these were either sold individually or there was a set with 2x the 8 inch version, the 12 inch is works for a smaller knife without an issue, but and I don't have any knifes this long.Overall, these are super handy and look nice. I would probably order more if there were options for singles of the 8.5 inch version or a set with two of the 8.5s.",

I slide the knife in from the open end with the edge pointing down.They have a good snug fit. However, for travel, I would strongly recommend one of those plastic holders that close, or a knife roll. With these sleeves, the knife can slide out the top if shaken or jostled hard enough.One thing to keep in mind... the inside is soft and fuzzy. That works great as long as it stays clean. Don't put your knife in it if the knife is not clean. If any debris gets inside, it is possible for it to end up causing one or more scratches to the side(s) of the knife. Once you get something in there that will cause scratches, it can be difficult cleaning the inside of the sleeve. The price on these is also extremely reasonable.",

                "reviewText": "This Knife Sheath set provides two sizes, 8\" and 12\" lengths. I used the sheaths to cover the cutting edge of the knives. They slipped on easily and stayed in place. I did experience some problem when the knife was damp when inserted into the sheath. The inner surface of the sheath has a fiber-like finish that coats the knife upon removal. I had to wipe the knife before using when removing from the sheath. I included photos of the particles that come from the sheath. When the knife is absolutely dry, I did not notice the issue. Overall, I needed a sheath to cover the knife edge. This product met that requirement well!",
