I haven\u2019t experienced any negative impact from that. I feel that the curved cutting edge makes it easier to work with. The weight of the knife makes it feel solid, well made and definitely not cheap. The handle feels perfectly designed in my hand. This knife cuts through fruit and vegetables like butter. It very easily peeled off a blemish on the skin of a tomato. I have used it to cut extremely thin uniform slices of onions. I also used it to slice up a thick crusty stuffed pizza, and it easily cut through it. I really love this knife, and I am very happy with my purchase.",

Knives were sharp, they fit well on the base, the base was easy to attach to the wall, and the knives stay in place. The magnet holds them firmly. I did need to place this somewhere I would accidentally poke myself or knock the knives inadvertently. Really pleased with the purchase!",

I have 2 chef knives from different brands (each in the 40-50 dollar range) and they are not nearly as good. So I would highly recommend getting this 6-piece set.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a knife of this size in my kitchen, so I took the plunge on this one, not quite knowing what to expect. I'm glad I did. The knife has great hand feel, the weight and the size of the handle convey a sense of quality. The blade is wider than other high-quality knives I have, and I like that. The handle wood is attractive. The whole feel is one of quality. The blade is not at all flimsy, but quite substantial and it won't flex.One thing I haven't evaluated yet (because I haven't had it long) is how it will respond to sharpening. But I'm not worried. A knife must be sharpened properly. (Other reviewers remark how sharp the knife is when you receive it- which it is, sharp enough to shave with, I think- but do they realize that with use it will dull and have to be resharpened?)I was so impressed that I also bought the paring knife from this series.I also have some high quality (and expensive) European knives, much more expensive than this one. This knife easily hangs with them, if not outclassing them.For some reason, the price on these knives goes up and down frequently. I got mine at a low price. Well worth it.",

Ein Duo-Schleifstein 400/1000 oder 1000/4000 ist ausreichend und ein wenig \u00dcbung mit einem Test-Messer.F\u00fcr ein Santoku-Messer ist die Schnittkante eigentlich zu stark gebogen, aber das ist nun mal das Design, entweder man mag es oder man mag es nicht. Mir gef\u00e4llt es gut.Also Leute, die mal was anderes m\u00f6chten als das \u00fcbliche Gyuto- oder Santoku-Einerlei, sind hier gut beraten --> Kaufempfehlung.Preislich es es kein besonderes Schn\u00e4ppchen, aber durchaus akzeptabel.",
