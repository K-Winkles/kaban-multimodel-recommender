                "reviewText": "A Chinese cleaver is the most useful item I use when I am allowed to use the kitchen. It makes cutting, slicing, chopping easy and the broad front is good to stir things in a pan. I put the broad blade over garlic cloves, pound them with my fist to crush them and then chop them up fine. Combine them with chopped parsley and butter, use the cleaver to cut the backs of lobster tails, pounding the back of the cleaver with your palm to split it, fluff out the meat so it\u2019ll come out easily, stick it in the oven for 25 minutes and you\u2019re done. Voila. A gourmet meal.My cleaver of choice cost me $5 at a garage sale ten years ago. Wooden handle is cracked, blade covered with rust. I explained to my domestic goddess that the rust just meant it\u2019s good carbon steel. She wanted a new stainless steel cleaver. She didn\u2019t want such a rusty relic in her kitchen and was of the opinion I am trying to poison her. She thinks I am a culinary criminal. Guess who won that argument.So I looked at the selection on Amazon and bought this. Full tang is important for safety. That means the metal from the blade goes all the way through the handle so it doesn\u2019t go flying off. Stainless steel, won\u2019t rust, which is important to 50% of my domestic population. And price. Ten bucks. I figured any cleaver I could get for a sawbuck would be awful. But this thing is really good. Sharp and beautifully made.Domestic tranquility for the Hamilton.Buy it.",

                "reviewText": "I never thought that I would love a knife. This makes chopping vegetables and meat so easy. Plus its pretty with the flowers on it. It came already very sharp, and after much use I was able to sharpen it again. It also is a good heavy quality. We have some knives that almost seem like they will bend or break when cutting into root veggies, not this one. It is very durable.I will probably buy another just to have. Highly recommend.",
