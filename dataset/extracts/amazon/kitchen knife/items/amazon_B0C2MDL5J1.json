                "reviewText": "This is a kitchen knife. I call this style a chopping knife for dicing and mincing.This knife is very sharp and nicely made.The description says that it is made of \u201cGerman High Carbon steel. I have never heard of that type of steel to be honest but, I will be looking for it where knives are concerned from now on. keeps an edge and stays sharp much longer and makes the job go more quickly. This knife is something I would recommend because compared to any I\u2019ve ever used this makes it seem like I have been using a dull hatchet. It is so much better than any knife I\u2019ve owned or used. It will cut meat with ease and chop veggies like they are butter.",

I didn't check the size and it is a little smaller than I expected as well. Definitely not beefy enough to get through tough stuff but will get the job done in a small kitchen as a secondary or even third kitchen knife.",
