                "reviewText": "Update, T+4 Years: still chopping!While starting life as a graduate student, I made the decision to get more serious about cooking to eat better and save money. A functional kitchen begins with quality cookware and a good set of knives; toward that end, I considered purchasing several of Victorinox's knife sets: Victorinox 46892 Fibrox 3-Piece Chef's Knife Set Victorinox 8-Piece Knife Block Set Victorinox 7-Piece Knife Block Set Victorinox Swiss Classic 15-Piece Cutlery Block Set In the end I found that, at Amazon's heavily-discounted prices, it's just as economical to construct a 'custom set' by purchasing the knives individually. This also ensures that you get exactly what you want, and you don't waste money on knives that you don't want or need.In the end, I purchased: Victorinox 40521 10-Inch Chef's Knife, Black Fibrox Handle Victorinox Fibrox 7-Inch Granton Edge Santoku Knife Victorinox 5-Inch Mini-Chef's Knife with Fibrox Handle Victorinox Honing Steel 12-Inch Round Regular Cut, Black Plastic Handle Henckels 20-Slot Super Knife Storage Block All of these products are very highly reviewed, and together they form an excellent introductory knife collection at a reasonable price.This 10\" Chef's Knife is definitely the workhorse of the set. While its large size is rather intimidating, it is incredibly light and very easy to handle. The cutting edge is amazingly sharp and, when cared for properly with handwashing and regular honing on a quality steel, it maintains its edge extraordinarily well. This knife far exceeds the quality of anything you will find in a brick-and-mortar store at a similar price point. While I'm sure that you could spend $100+ on a professional forged chef's knife that would perform better, this product more than meets the needs of the typical at-home cooking hobbyist.",

                "reviewText": "This is not a sexy knife but it's comfortable, it holds an edge, and it is a terrific bargain. For that, I love it.I have large hands and this fits me very well. You can see from the pictures that the handle has a straight top and contoured bottoms. It might not be apparent that the sides are straight, too. That makes the handle blocky. For me, this makes my grip much more secure than knives that have rounded sides. This shape fits very naturally in my hand, so it is secure and it is not fatiguing to use.The handle has a rough texture, but it's not raspy. I don't feel like I had to build up calluses just to use it. The texture, plus the shape of the handle, makes it easy to keep a safe grip, even when my hands are wet or greasy.There's not bolster on this knife. Instead, the handle flares down where it meets the blade (just down, it doesn't get any wider). That flare is big enough that I've never felt that my hand would slip forward and contact the blade.The knife feels sturdy. If I grab it in both hands, I can flex it about a quarter inch. It weighs about 6 5/8 ounces, which is is enough heft to keep me aware of it, but is light enough for my daily use. I use it for veggies and meat and am very satisfied with it. I haven't tried to butcher a chicken with it.I find the curve to be workable. I have no problems rocking it for chopping. The blade is tall enough that I don't worry about rapping my knuckles when chopping, either.I have had no problems with it keeping an edge. I hand wash it and it hasn't developed any stains or rust spots.Overall, it's a good knife and a great bargain. Probably the best thing about it is that at this price, I can hand it to guests and not cringe in fear when they bang away on the cutting board.",

Coupled with a small wooden cutting board my wife has made great meals.Running a few strokes on a steel once a month keeps it sharp enough to cut without putting much pressure on it.Goof KNIFE, happy WIFE, good food,what more to want!",

When they actually lose their initial sharpness, the knife can be easily maintained with a honing steel, and later, a tungsten carbide \"V\" sharpening device(\"Accusharp\"). My knife edge has held up very well, but I'm just a home cook. I have an 8\" Fibrox chef knife, a 6\", and now a 5\", all with Fibrox handles. One of the things that I like about these is that the handle is angled \"up\" a bit, to provide more clearance for the hand knuckles.Victorinox makes good knives.",
