                "reviewText": "For context, at the time of this review, this item is less than $3 and ships free with Prime or orders >$35 without Prime. With that in mind, this is an incredible value for what it is: a cheap knife. It comes sharp. The plastic sheath keeps it sharp on its way to you, and can keep it from dulling if you throw it in a drawer with other utensils. It's not super comfortable, nor ergonomic. The blade isn't tall, and doesn't work well as a scraper nor for transferring your freshly diced whatever. The blade material is super thin, making the overall package light weight and somewhat flimsy. The thin blade makes it uncomfortable to add additional pressure to the spine with your off hand. It doesn't stay sharp for a ridiculously long time. Using it alongside quality knives - or worse, a custom chef's knife - is laughable. But this knife will still cut meats, vegetables, and fruit. There's enough material to sharpen it a large number of times, but only you can decide if it's worth saving $3 vs picking up another one that's factory sharp. If you're here, you're probably not looking for a wonder knife. This is utility at an unbelievably low price. The performance is just as good as knives that cost 3 to 5 times as much - which are still cheap, flimsy knives themselves. YMMV.",
