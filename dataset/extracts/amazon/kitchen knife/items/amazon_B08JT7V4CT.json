                "reviewText": "These are the sharpest knives I own and are perfect for preparing small vegetables such as lemons, tomatoes and mushrooms. The blades are ultra sharp. I admit I also use them to effortlessly cut through Amazon package tape. My only wish is that the handles themselves were a bit more ergonomic. They feel a little too thin to me compared to my other knives. They are almost like box cutter sharp, be careful when using! Highly recommend this set. I opted for the multi-color version myself.It is refreshing to see that they are made in USA, I didn't notice this until I wrote the review, I had just assumed they were from China.",

                "reviewText": "For decades, I've been on the look out for these kinds of knives -- the ones with the teeny tiny serrations on the blade. For whatever reason, they have become an extinct variety and are virtually impossible (for me, anyway) to locate, even kitchen specific stores don't have them.Because it's been so long since I've used a brand new one, I'd forgotten how sharp they could be in the beginning It can easily do damage to your counter top if not careful so consider a cutting board when you first start using.All that being said, despite the handles being nothing more exciting than a plastic-y material, these knives cut through food stuff well enough. Honestly, for this price, another brand would have given me only one knife --and not even the kind I wanted -- but with these I got three, so I'm happy. I can only hope these knives will continue to be made available. 5 STARS without a doubt!",
