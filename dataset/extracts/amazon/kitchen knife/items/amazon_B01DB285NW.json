And you might think \"Well does it suck?\" There's a couple poor reviews buried in here saying these knives aren't even sharp and can't cut any better than butter knives. That is definitely not my experience. They are not GREAT knives but they certainly cut, and for my little needs - things like I need to cut some cheese or some bread or dice up some chicken - they're fine! If you're a super cook who does half an hr of prep before every meal you might want something a little more higher grade but for Joe Average they'll do. And at the price point they are a steal.The scissors that came with the set are just super super excellent by the way, probably separately a pair of scissors like that would be 8 bucks by themselves",

                "reviewText": "I have owned a set of these Farberware knives that lasted me many years, now time for a new set as one knife just broke. The other knives are still in great shape. A couple of steak knives have gone missing over time with moving, so I wanted a nice new set. Overall, I like this new set very much, BUT, the quality on a few of the items is not as good as it was on my original set which happens when companies cut corners to save money so the updated products. Here are some issues I found: The Boning shears are not as good quality as original. The handle feels cheap and they don't seem as sturdy. Not sure if they will handle boning a chicken or any other very well may hurt hands. I am keeping my original shears as they are much better and still in great shape. The Bread Knife has been replaced with a slicing knife. The bread knife was a great knife to have and to do away with it for a slicing knife (which I am guessing means bread BUT they cannot call it a bread knife any more as the edge is NOT serrated like a true bread knife (The original was and it was amazing so I am keeping the original). And, the Santoku knife is not slightly rounded like a real Santoku blade normally is, the blade is completely flat and doesn't seem to have the stay sharp edge so I will wait and see how that lasts or if will be hard to use due to shape and if will need sharpening. But, overall.. Nice to have a fresh set of knives. I don't think people would notice the small issues I have if they never owned the original set. The original set had a nice oval stainless steel plate with the name Farberware on it too, which shows that the quality and workmanship on these knives has diminished over time. Regardless, I still definitely recommend this set. Worth every dollar!",

It doesn't take up much room on my kitchen counter, which is a plus, so I would definitely recommend this for people with smaller kitchens or who are just getting into cooking!",

                "reviewText": "The value on this set of knifes is really good. They are well made with non-slip plastic handles and you get a number of accessories in the set. How did Farberware do it and make the price point? Two ways: the included knife block is rough finished and the knives are of a higher gauge (thinner) metal so they do not have the heft of a substantial higher grade knife. The weight of a knife can make a difference to someone with more experience and let the weight of the blade do some of the work. Not the case with these. But they are sharp, they cut well and clean easily. If you need a comprehensive set of knives now and on a budget, this is a great choice.",
