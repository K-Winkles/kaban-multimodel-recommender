                "reviewText": "Brought this for my 4 year old grandson who loves to cook and my 15 month old granddaughter who is starting to help. It is all high quality and works so well. My grandson is in love with the peeler and the scalloped slicer and the wooden chopper is great for the little one. These are functional kitchen tools that work....but won't slice skin like a regular knife if they slip. One word of warning...the little holes on the colored part of the shape cutters is small enough for a curious little finger to get in but also tight enough for it to get stuck. Luckily I saw my grandson struggling to remove his finger right away and was able to quickly help get it off. It was really stuck....another minute and it would have been swelling enough we might have had to cut it off! The holes need to be either much bigger or much smaller.Overall though a big win in my kitchen with both kids!",
