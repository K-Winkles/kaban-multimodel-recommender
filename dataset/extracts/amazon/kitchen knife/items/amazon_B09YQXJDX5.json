                "reviewText": "It\u2019s a nice looking knife. the Damascus pattern is engraved onto a steel blade . Don't Expect 300 time folded steel .It got a little tiny dot of spot rust after a wash it that came right off. But did leave a slightly discovered dark spot about the size of , well if I made a dot with a sharpie but it\u2019s not a black dot just a shade darker that the steel.The pattern hides it quite well.Not the absolute best steel out there but it is sharp and comes with a two stage sharpener. It holds its edge pretty well,The packaging is amazing. A very solid blue box with cut to size foam insert . Very reusable as a bot to store it in.The handle is solid and it\u2019s full tang .The balance is quite nice.This is a budget knife. It doesn\u2019t feel like a big honking 5 mm thick professional chopper but it is more solid that 85% of anything at Wally-mart -worldIt looks cool and does what it\u2019s suppose to overall. Don\u2019t expect anything over the top tho. It\u2019s a nice looking very basic knife .It\u2019s not what I would take to work with me in a professional kitchen but would do decent with the causal home kitchen",
