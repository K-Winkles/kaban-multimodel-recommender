With the included blade guards, they can go into a drawer really easily and not risk cutting your hand off when you rummage around for them. And with that in mind, they are very very sharp, which is great. And like my more expensive block-based knives, a simple strop is all it takes to get them back to razor sharp. They take and hold an edge pretty well, and give us plenty of knives to use on those days where we seem to need them all. Perfect set.",

Instead, I got her these, mainly because they were colorful, and a full set instead of just a single knife. Here is her honest opinion:\"After trying these knives on various items, such as a tomato and onion, I found they work very well. I believe these can be sharpened if they get dull which you cannot do with a ceramic knife.I will use these for many applications.\"She really likes her ceramic knives, and I understand why, but the fact that they can chip so easily is a big bummer. It's not great to know these aren't as sharp as she'd like, but like she said; maybe they can be sharpened?",

You could just about shave with these (honestly, I tested one when I opened the box out of curiosity and it cut the hair on my arm). It slices through meat like chicken breast easier than any other knife I have. I definitely recommend this if you want a colorful and functional set of knives.",
