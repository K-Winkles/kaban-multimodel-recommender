                "reviewText": "I bought a set 3 years ago after I sold my house and moved into a high-end apartment and wanted a certain aesthetic in my kitchen. I switched to black silverware and knives. They looked great. I bought a second set to keep as a spare in-case Amazong stopped selling them. Now, 3 years later I just moved into a house and bought my 3rd set (I can't find the other two in all the boxes anywhere, LOL).As far as durability, I used them regularly for over 2 years at first and they remained sharp and the pain had minor scuffs but didn't peel or anything. I don't know about other people's usage but I'm pretty gentle and careful with my stuff. I used it for cutting steaks, giant butternut squash, tomatoes, frozen chicken, my fingers (accidentally)... and they continued to remain effective and I never sharpened them once. Let's get back to that squash. Those are usually pretty difficult and scary but one of the knives in this set, if you use the right technique will cut right through it like butter.I can't see myself using any other set. The main thing is the clear holder and black color, it helps to keep the kitchen feeling open and less cluttered.I attached a picture, can you spot them? They just look like they belong there and out of the way.",
