Bought it mainly to test out the Japanese style handle be ause i have never used one. Expected to just give it away sense im so traditional. Now im in the kitchen telling people not to touch my knife. ",

I\u2019m not entirely sure how this happened, but yeah, they can\u2019t even chop an onion without applying a significant amount of pressure. Looking at other reviews, this is likely an outlier. I\u2019m going to use a three-stage electric sharpener on them before giving them another try, and may update my review to reflect how they perform in the future.",
