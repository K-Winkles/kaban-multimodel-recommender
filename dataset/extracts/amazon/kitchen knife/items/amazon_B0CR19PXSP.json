                "reviewText": "These JJOO paring knives are fairly typical stamped stainless steel inexpensive knives. Out of the box, they are pretty sharp if slightly rough edged. Probably will take some cleanup with a knife sharpener sooner rather than later. The blades are hollow ground so they'll stay sharp a little longer. Blades are quite stiff for this type of knife, with sheepsfoot/mini-santoku shaped ends. Being not pointed at all, those ends are far more useful for slicing and peeling than for poking holes. But for those who do small chopping and slicing jobs with a paring knife as I do, these are the perfect blade shape.As with any of this style of knives, the plastic handle is simply molded around the blade. There is no bolster. These seem reasonably well made, with tighly molded wrenches. The handles are bright distinctive colors, very easy to find in a drawer or color code to avoid contamination. Each knife comes with a blade protector in matching color. The protectors clip on to the blades very securely.For the price, these are very nice little knives.",
