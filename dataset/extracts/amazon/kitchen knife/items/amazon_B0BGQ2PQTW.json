                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Utopia Kitchen 8-inch Chef Knife and have been using it for a variety of kitchen tasks. First off, the balance of the knife is commendable \u2013 it sits comfortably in the hand, making it a pleasure to use for extended periods of cooking. Whether it's dicing vegetables, slicing meats, or mincing herbs, this knife performs with precision and ease, a testament to its well-thought-out design and craftsmanship.However, I've noticed that the sides of the knife are prone to scratching. After a few uses, there are visible marks that, while they don't interfere with the knife's functionality, are quite noticeable. It's a cosmetic issue that doesn't affect performance, but it's something to be aware of if the appearance of your kitchen tools is important to you.Overall, despite the scratching, the utility of the knife isn't compromised. It remains sharp, reliable, and efficient",

It comes very sharp \"out of the box\" and they could not be happier. Sturdy and has a good quality heft feel to it. Not as light as I would it to be but for $10, I can't complain.As to the rust and tarnish people are experiencing, please read the manual that comes with it, you are expected to read and understand the product you are purchasing. In addition, don't expect this knife to hold its edge, buy a steel and hone it after several uses. It's only $10, if you're expecting higher quality cough up more than $100.",

I'd never held a knife so big and dangerous, it's like a murder weapon. I'm terrified of cutting myself with this, as your fingers would come right off with one slip of this tool. The tip is razor sharp, it's a kitchen tool to be respected. be careful with it, but it works well. No need to buy a more expensive knife.",
