First off, the quality is legit. The blade is sharp (like, seriously sharp - watch your fingers!), feels sturdy, and has held its edge well so far. No more hacking through veggies like I'm taming a jungle! Plus, the handle is comfy, even after I'm on a kitchen roll. But the real winner here is the price. Let's just say I wasn't expecting Michelin-star quality for the price I paid, but this little guy surprised me. It's become my go-to knife for everything from chopping veggies to slicing meat, and it hasn't let me down once. If you're looking for a no-nonsense, high-quality knife that won't put a dent in your wallet, this is it. Trust me, this Amazon Basics knife is a kitchen hero in disguise!",

I am definitely getting a 2nd pair.",

So I wanted a high quality but inexpensive knife to leave at their house. And this Amazon knife was exactly that! Good weight, well made, sturdy and sharp. Def recommend. But keep in mind ALL knives get dull, you MUST buy a knife sharpener. I don't know why some people think a knife will stay sharp forever by itself. But this knife is great, and with a quick sharpening it does it job.",
