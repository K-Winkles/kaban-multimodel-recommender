                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. At first, they don't feel sharp....but surprise! They are very sharp!! All of them cut exceptionally great. When you get to the larger knives, from fresh bread I cooked to the meats I have cut they are essential overall great for a chef or anyone else. I found the chef knife will with zero problem cut bones! The sharpener you need to learn to use, so don't throw away any knives yet. The sharpener takes time to learn if you are not skilled with this one. Take a old knive an practice alot! The sizzors work for small work or if you are in a hurry to cut up chicken. As for the peeler, I don't use it unless it's for using on a hard chocolate or making nice flowers with veggies! It has a handle no matter how wet, oils on your hand, or cleaning is a breeze. They are sturdy, light, and I hand wash all of the set to keep them clean. Only thing i haven't used for is a cake yet! Lol, but I already know anyone I choose will be great....plus if you have family or friends over they are a great talking point....so, I give it 5 stars! Just incase, have a few banaids. The steak knives are really sharp! Enjoy your kitchen with new knives! Experiment with them and see which one becomes your favorite!",

I also like the comfort of the handles and they look absolutely stunning The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because they have to be cleaned a particular way but I guess that would be smart to do with any knife set to keep them nice. I\u2019m hoping these last a long time. I also purchased magnetic strips as I plan to hang them. They aren\u2019t installed yet so I\u2019m keeping in the base for now.",
