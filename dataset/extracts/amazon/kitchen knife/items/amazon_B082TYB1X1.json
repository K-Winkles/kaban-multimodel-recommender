The knives are the nicest that he has ever had... and the knife sharpener is really nice to have, too! He loves to eat a good meal. So, he is always in the kitchen or outdoors grilling or smoking up a tasty meal. These knives have to be tough enough to handle daily wear. They seem to be sturdy. Since he has only had them a lil bit over a week, I'll update my review if anything should go awry. I'm hopeful that this knife set will wear well over time!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars High quality Knife set at affordable price",
                "reviewText": "Overall, this is a high-quality set of knives at an affordable price. Inside the package is a note from the creators. One can see that a lot of care went into the knives. Each knife was individually wrapped; the covered in plastic to prevent scratches, the blade covered by cardboard and at the tip of each blade is a small plastic insert to protect the blade from puncturing the shipping material. Real attention to detail in my opinion. The appearance of the knives is stunning! Along with the thickness and sharpness of the blades makes this a truly awesome addition to my kitchen. Additionally, the scissors are what takes this set over the top.Pro\u2019s:-The color of the handles. Even though walnut is the listed type, they have a sight reddish appearance, almost a \u201ccherry\u201d color, which is a fabulous look.-Very Sharp blades. Was able to cut newspaper like butter. Each blade performing flawlessly.-Handle Grip \u2013 Well thought out curved shape of the handle that aligns with the hand making them very comfortable to hold.-Heavier than other cutlery sets I\u2019ve used. They don\u2019t bend as easily, making them stronger. They have a solid piece of metal from the tip to the end of the stock, however, they are much thicker, making them even more durable. The steak knife metal is 1/16\u201d thick and the larger items including the scissors are 1/8\u201d thick.-Steak Knives: The serrated cutting edge has wider tip to tip width (1/8th inch); wider than more common steak knives.-The wooden base is wider than other knife sets holders I\u2019ve used, making it a more stable base. The set weighs approx. 10 pounds.-Looking online, other knife sets are easily 300.00 dollars. I think that this is an affordable set where quality was not sacrificed. For approx. $4.21 per item, I am very confident that this set will last a very long time.-The scissors: This is the one item that sets these apart from other cutlery sets. They are approx. 10\u201d long, spring loaded to open and very sharp. They will cut whatever cooking needs one has. I have cut fruit off the tree; my wife has cut chicken and pork bones with them. The blade is extremely long making this item very versatile. It\u2019s like having garden shears for the kitchen. A stunning look and extremely versatile item in the set.-My wife has used some of the knives to carve fruit. The smaller slicing and pairing knives have been useful at carving the layers of skin off a watermelon. Each knife performs its function well. My wife is extremely impressed with these knives.Con\u2019s:-While purchasing, there was one type of wood selection; which is \u201cWalnut\u201d. This is very nice color; however, the Amazon add appears to show a more \u2018reddish\u2019 color. The wooden block is truly a walnut color, while the knife handles are all more cherry color in appearance. I prefer the \u201ccherry\u201d appearance and would have liked the entire set to have that color. I suggest that the amazon or other adds show the true color of the block for the color being offered. Notice within the picture of the color variance between the advertisement and the actual items. I would even suggest staining the block with a more reddish tint to match the handles and selling that as a color variant.The steak knives: While they cut great, the individual blade points are a little further apart than other standard steak knives. This causes the cut to be a little less smooth. The meat gets a little more torn while cutting.",

                "reviewText": "I've been looking for a new knife set for some time now, and after reading reviews of MANY different sets, some moderately priced, others higher-end, and it was between this and some other's comparably priced and at the same quality. What made me choose this is because it fit my culinary needs as well as matched my kitchen to help complete the look. Unboxing and setup was of course very easy, I didn't look at the instructions for what knife/piece went where, as most where self-explanatory so you can put a lot of them where you want for what makes sense to you.What I like/love: The look, feel, weight, and style of the knives and tools, it feels very professional. All of the pieces fit my needs thus far and so I'm happy with them thus far in their performance and cut through anything I've put it through with ease. Also easy to clean as well thus far.What I don't like/could be better: The sheaths/slots for the knives could've been better by making them metal or with built in sharpeners like some knife sets (yes, I could've bought a set that has that, but that'd been an extra $200 or so) but sometimes when putting the knives back it sometimes sticks in the block because it's so sharp (great for the knife, not for the block) so that's a minor gripe but not a deal-breaker. I know it COMES with a knife sharpener, and I have an electronic one as well, but for the smaller steak knives it'd be nice to have metal sharpener in there since those get the most use.As far as cleaning, I DON'T put them in the dishwasher, I hand-wash them which sometimes is a pain after major cooking/eating/cleanup and all of the other dishes are in the dishwasher, and those are the only ones left, but I'm not taking any chances as you've seen other people did get rust spots and those are annoying to take off.So if this has the pieces you need, fits the look and feel of your kitchen, and you don't mind hand washing the knives (you can take a chance with the dishwasher if you want to), then this just may be the one for you.",

I chose the walnut as I had recently installed new kitchen cabinets made of walnut, and wanted to co-ordinate the look. The block is an orange-ish/red-ish color, and not very appealing to me. It certainly doesn't match any of the walnut I have in the kitchen. I'm considering sanding it down and refinishing it, but I'm not sure how it would turn out, as I'm not convinced that the wood itself is actually walnut.The style, look, and feel of the knives is what increased the rating in this review. The block itself would be a 2 at the MOST!",
