                "reviewText": "Sometimes when out of town visiting relatives and friends I get called to KP duty which I am happy and honored to help out in the kitchen. Once in the kitchen and looking things to use to cut food into smaller pieces or that can be used for peeling vegies....I am usually at a loss. Most of the time the selection of knives and peelers leaves a lot to be desired. Most are dull making the work to be done more difficult. (We have a good knife set in the home and I maintain an edge on all of them.)Out of frustration I put together a small traveling culinary set consisting of a vegetable peeler, paring knife. kitchen shears, and this folding chef's knife. Perfect, now am ready to visit and help in the kitchen.The quality of the knife is topnotch, it locks safely in place, and is easy to fold up. Razor sharp it is.",

                "reviewText": "Just received this item, review is based off first-impressions:TLDR: a fine knife, fit for light carving and prep work. May need some initial tuning to secure handle scales and straighten the blade, but overall I'm pleased with the quality (especially for the price).Knife arrived in a classy box, contained withing a faux-burlap bag (as pictured in product description). The knife as a whole is fairly sizeable, with an appropriate handle to control the size of the blade.The mechanism and lock are as expected - I may not trust them with my life necessarily, but they will keep the knife in place well-enough for the intended labor. Blade is razor-sharp, exceeding my initial expectations for a blade in this price range. Blade tapers to an exceptionally thin primary bevel, with short secondary bevel facilitating the sharp edge. Due to that thin taper, the blade may be slightly warped (will need to get it to the work bench to know for sure). If that's the case, because the blase is 440 stainless steel, I feel would feel comfortable lightly twisting the blade back straight, if necessary.Due to the thin edge and relatively soft steel (stainless vs. high-carbon), plus the liner-lock keeping the blade open, this knife is not well-suited for heavy work / chopping. I would use this for paring (despite the blade shape) and light carving / light prep. For non-kitchen work, use extra caution when handling a blade of this size / sharpness / shape (unconventional for EDC applications). Remember that the thin edge is not suited for heavy work.Handle scales are olive wood, with a fine finish to keep the wood sealed. One of the scales on my knife was loose, and showed evidence of being patched with a shim to mitigate the effect of the poor fit (pictured). Scale still shifts near the top (by the top of the scale), which I'm hoping will be solved by either tightening the star-screw and / or a dab of glue.Overall, this is a good product, which I will be happy to utilize in my kitchen. My only complaints are the one poorly-fitted scale and the slight warping of the blade, which are both fixable. All things considered, this is an excellent product, and I would have been happy to receive this as a gift. Consider this for any chef in your life, especially if they like knives.",

Like they've never worked in a restaurant and not heard chefs scream about knife care.I've tried bring in good knives and insist they be sheathed when not in use and only used on wood or plastic boards. They will use them on metal in a pinch. They will store them, blade down, in a metal shaker with other metal tools.While they saw through citrus with a brand new cheap, short, lightweight paring knife I'm getting the job done faster and with far less effort.It's not the greatest knife ever, for sure. It's not forged, the bolster isn't, well, there, so not great for a pinch grip. But using it only for bar fruit and keeping it away from the abuses of others I think it will last me a good, long time.And the foldable.... It just makes it so much easier. It fits in a small pocket in my bag. It can stay there and I don't have to take it out to make room for real life when I'm not at work so I don't have to worry about forgetting it.",
