I\u2019ve been using this knives for about 10 months, they are still sharp and I cook every single day. Love the design, they are light weighted, they hadn\u2019t rusted, but I try to keep them dry when I\u2019m not using them, that means not letting them sit on water. Everyone who comes to my house and uses the knives tell me they are pretty sharp. Overall great quality!!!",
