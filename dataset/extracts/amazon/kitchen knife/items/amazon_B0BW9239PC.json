                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this kitchen knife set, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. The cleanliness and quality of these knives have truly exceeded my expectations.First and foremost, the cleanliness factor is a game-changer. The blades are incredibly easy to clean, and they seem to resist staining and discoloration, which is a huge plus for someone like me who values a spotless kitchen. Even after cutting up tomatoes and other acidic ingredients, there's no sign of staining or odor retention. A quick rinse and wipe, and they're as good as new. This feature alone has made meal prep and cooking a breeze.Now, let's talk about quality. These knives are an absolute dream to work with. The precision and sharpness of the blades are remarkable. They effortlessly glide through all types of ingredients, whether it's slicing, dicing, or chopping. The ergonomic handles provide a comfortable grip and excellent control, reducing the risk of accidents in the kitchen.What I appreciate most is that this set offers a variety of knife types, perfectly suited for various culinary tasks. From the versatile chef's knife to the small utility knife, each one has its purpose and excels in its role. The high-quality materials used in these knives ensures that they will remain sharp for a long time, even tho they do feature an integrated sharpener which is a relief compared to my previous knife set that needed frequent sharpening.In terms of durability, these knives have held up exceptionally well. I've been using them daily for a couple weeks now, and they show no signs of wear and tear. They still look and perform like they did on day one.This kitchen knife set has proven to be an excellent investment. The combination of exceptional cleanliness and top-notch quality has elevated my cooking experience. If you're in the market for a knife set that's easy to maintain and delivers outstanding performance, look no further. This set has truly earned its place in my kitchen, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who values both cleanliness and quality in their culinary tools.",

So my farberware 8\u201d is in there for now. Also traded out the 3.5 paring with my Mercer. The Mercer fits perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "For me\u2026who had no good knives these are the difference between a lot of prep vs little prep. They are sharp, really sharp and did I say sharp! We have sharpened two of the knives already and it takes little effort to resharpen them. They also have an excellent balance in your hand so not as much fumbling when chopping. I think it was a good value for the money and I still remark how much of a difference they make.",
