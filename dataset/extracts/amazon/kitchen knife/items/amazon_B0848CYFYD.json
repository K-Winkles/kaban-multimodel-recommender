Put your bent index finger on one side of the blade, just ahead of the bolster, with your thumb on the other side \"pinching\" the blade between your two fingers. Easy to Care For Less maintenance so you can spend more time cooking. The Shogun Series washes up quick with soap and water. Let air dry, or gently wipe off excess water before storing safety in the included PerfectFit sheath. Ideal for protecting your blade both at home and on the go.

                "reviewText": "So to start this off, this is my day 1 review. I'm gonna update this after about a month of constant use. I'll see what edge retention is like, how the handle holds up, and if the blade continues to be as beautiful as it is after being repeatedly washed. I was NOT given a discount or free product to write a review, I just did my research and decided to give Dalstrong a shot based off reviews and my knowledge of knives and steel forging.Out of the box, this thing is sharper than any other kitchen knife I've ever bought. It's insanely sharp. I could cut paper thin slices out of a tomato that was just sitting on a cutting board without having to hold the tomato. It glides through most everything. I did have 2 small complaints out of the box, which I've reached out to Dalstrong about to see if there's a way I can fix them, which are a 1-2\" scuff on the handle that feels somewhat abrasive, and a very small rust spot on the front of the knife in one of the Damascus layers (these two issues are why I gave it 4 stars, for a cheap knife I wouldn't care, but for something over $100 I feel it has slightly more weight). I'll update once they get back to me as well.As for feel, the opinions differ here based on hand size and what people are used to. I like a quality forged blade, and I have very large hands. I think the knife feels absolutely perfect in the hand. Weight, grip, rivets, handle material, all of it. To me it couldn't have a better handle. My wife on the other hand, has tiny hands. She thinks that the handle is too large. Not too large to use, just not comfortable. She is fond of Cutco handles, which are thermal resin and very high quality... though their blades are just cheap stamped steel that has no heft to it. I own both and strongly prefer forged blades with weight behind them. Also I don't like the cutco handles. They feel narrow and uncomfortable to me.The general appearance of the knife is beautiful. It has a beautiful center rivet made from 3 copper rings and a bunch of brass rings. The Damascus is far less pronounced than the photos lead me to believe, which is sad, but not something worth knocking a star off for. The hammered look is fantastic. I love the lion head logo stamped in the blade, though I am concerned that a health department employee may be less than fond of it because I could imagine meat particles getting trapped in it. I bought this because I'm starting a food truck and I want to find the knives I'll be using in my food truck, this will just be one of many as I do BBQ and I'm particular about the blades I use for various cuts of meat.Lastly I'll mention the packaging since people seem to care about such things. In a word, it's excellent. More accurately it's over the top. It keeps the blade very stable and provides a very satisfying unboxing experience.Overall I'd say excellent. If I can fix the little scuff and the rust spot I'm gonna change it to 5 star. In the price range, unbeatable. Shuns and real Wusthoff forged blades are the only ones I've used that I would say can match the quality, and frankly the Wusthoffs actually fall below, especially on workmanship.UPDATE 1-6-2018I talked to their customer service the day after I received the knife because of the tiny scuff/spot on the blade and they sent me a new knife and told me to keep the first. Unbelievable service. I just wanted to know if there was a treatment or product to use that would get it out. Both have continued to perform flawlessly over the last several months, even without sharpening (I was letting them go to see when I'd notice a decline in performance). Still about 98% of what they were out of the box. I'm gonna be buying a full set both for my truck and my home in the next few months. I've used just about all the knife brands they make, I'd put my Dalstrong Shogun against any $500 knife you can find, happily. I'm even planning to purchase their $400 gladiator set for my mom when she graduates with her doctorate.If I had one complaint, it would be that they don't seem to offer a full set of their Shogun series blades. I'd love one with a nice modern, high quality block. Not that I particularly mind ordering each one individually. Would just make it easier.",

                "reviewText": "This knife is great. They responded to my question almost immediately, and from what I've been reading everywhere it sounds like they honor the 100% satisfaction guaranteed thing pretty enthusiastically, so the customer service is great too.The Damascus is Clad, not fake/etched by laser (if you sanded it they would still show, lets put that to rest). Hard core, soft outer layers that chip less, sharpen easier, and are higher corrosion resistance.. .and they look cool. Damascus clad is not 100% the same as traditional Damascus no, but it's close enough and it serves a purpose functionally and cool looking. I'm fine with it. I don't know why people are expecting a $800 art piece knife out of a product, that I feel, is meant to strike a nice balance between kitchen or work workhorse, and looking pretty sharp on a knife block too.The blade is welded to the handle, but the visibility of the weld is minimal, especially with all the other patterning going on near it. The handle is comfortable, seems durable. I like this blade for rocking cuts, it has a nice curve but not so much that you cant dice chop either. The weight of the blade feels even and great. I can't complain about anything on this knife, I like it. I also purchased the non serrated steak knives and I have to say they look even better than the Gyuto. I'm very glad I got those second and I like those even more than the Gyuto.Bottom line is this, if you're looking for a crazy expensive custom art piece knife at the price of around $100, of course you're not going to be happy. It's not going to glide through zero resistance like an ultra thin specialty non-stainless all hand-made by one guy Japanese knife with a single bevel that you have to dry and oil to keep from rusting every time you cut with it and sharpen or have sharpened differently. No standard mass produced stainless double bevel knife will do that. If you want a solid kitchen knife that is aggressively priced, about as sharp as you can get this kind of knife to get, stays sharp pretty long, looks cooler than the average persons knife, and still works great for cooking dinner... well it seems like a pretty well rounded knife to me. I have a wide range of professional use German knives, and a couple Japanese artsy knives I'm afraid to use/damage, and many in between, and beater knives too. These are what's on my kitchen knife block and I plan to buy more as I can afford to.I saw a few accusations about what it means to be Damascus and people shouting fake reviews.... I don't know about all that. It's a knife... with some pros and cons... like all products... and I think the pros are pretty solid for the price point. A knife snob might poo-poo it I guess. They aren't right for everyone probably, but all I can say is I'm happy with them!Several years update: Knives still doing fine. No chips, sharpen up nicely. I have some other very high end knives in my collection and yeah they are better but these cost significantly less. I know some people like to talk smack on this brand but they have been good for me. I have several dalstrong knives, I returned a couple I didn't like and kept most of them. in the end all that matters is you like it.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second Dalstrong knife. My Phantom chef's knife was so handy, I purchased a Shogun X for myself and one for a co-worker. It's great. In everyday use it's great for slicing and chopping on plastic or wood. The shape of the knife is very comfortable and easy to control. It's quite heavy and well balanced with a good thickness across the top of the blade. The bolster is comfortable and the handle allows for different grip preferences. I use it at home and it has quickly become my daily go-to blade, and I haven't had to use a stone in three months; although, I do hone with a ceramic honer and strop weekly. In a commercial kitchen with 2-6 hours of use daily the edge retains well with daily honing, weekly stropping, and stoned once every three or four months. One knife came out of the box needed slight honing, but the other was exquisitely sharp.Overall, the edge retention on this knife is better than some of my more expensive blades from other makers used in the same conditions.The finish of this knife is very classy. The \"damascus\" pattern is very subtle and the hammered texture makes scratches to the polish less visible. Patina formation has been slow, but I'm excited to see what this knife looks like in a few more years. Hammered finish also assists slightly in reducing that pesky, food-sticking-to-your-knife problem.The handle is full tang with three full rivets. The handle is nice for daily usage since it's a bit easier to clean and holds up to moisture better than most woods. It also looks really nice with the classy rivet roset and the modern texture and shape.Get this knife if you cut things every day. Just remember that the core steel is harder than most European steels, and you will need a ceramic rod for edge up-keep.",
