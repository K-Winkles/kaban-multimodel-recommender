                "reviewText": "First thing I did when trying out the searated knife was to slice my thumb open. I feel like the knives are made to last but I feel like they need better ergonomics in the handle so you can get a better grip on the knife. I kept fumbling while cutting an onion and found that the knife had slipped in my hand and the sharp edge was facing up. This happened several times. For some reason I just can't keep a good grip on the knives. I still like them and hope I will get more savy using them. They are both a great size and make a nice set.",
