                "reviewText": "I consider a #3 cleaver to be the most useful tool in the kitchen or for chopping down trees for firewood. But sometimes a smaller cleaver for fine work or chopping down smaller trees is needed. This mini cleaver is great because though the blade is scaled down, the handle is made for full sized cooks.It's well balanced and does the job with ease. It has a single bevel edge that favors the right handed.It's pretty sharp and useable out of the box but for lazy people like like me who like the weight of the blade to do the work, a couple minutes on a 2000 stone will get you there. So far it seems to hold the edge well.It's not as elegant or refined as high end knives but it's a lot more knife than you might expect for the really low price.",

The only thing I've noticed is that when I use it to cut through an onion it seems to cut at an angle instead of straight down. It is probably just me and my angle but I've never noticed this problem before. All in all, this is a nice knife to have and the price is too good not to give it a try.",
