Then on top of that there's all the prep for the rest of us in the house. I was getting fatigued using a Chef's knife and having problems with vegetables splitting into irregular cuts (no matter how sharp my Chef's knife was). After researching Nakiri knives I decided to invest in one. So incredibly grateful I did. This knife cuts with little effort and slices through the thickest vegetables without any hesitation leaving behind a smooth, even cut. Night and day in terms of Nakiri vs. Chef's knife. Highly recommend it. The knife is well made, well balanced, with a comfortable handle that keeps its comfort no matter how long you're using it for. My new favorite knife!",

I don't know how the blade will hold up but with that being said, i feel it is well built! One of the sharpest knives I own. When I purchased this, I didn't pay attention to the weight. When taken out of the box, I was almost disappointed with the weight but once I used it, I quickly changed my mind. Great product!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I did a quick review of knives. I'm at the age where I need to invest some money in kitchen knives. Our friend has Wusthof, which we enjoyed while staying at their vacation home. But they're terribly expensive. I think this will do until we get to that point where we can invest some money in the kitchen knives.I honestly don't believe this is Damascus's process for $50. And it's not the X50CRMOV15 that Wusthof is made out of.X50CRMOV15:0.5% Carbon: For better hardness as well as the ability to keep wear or corrosion at bay15% Chromium: For great tensile strength, reliable ability to retain an edge, and better power to resist wear as well as corrosion1% Silicon: For boosted strength.1% Manganese: For better hardness as well as brittleness0.8% Molybdenum: For boosted strength as well as machinability (flexibility during manufacturing process)0.20% Vanadium: For better hardenability as well as resistance to wear0.015% Sulfur: For better flexibility during the manufacturing process0.04% Phosphorus: For boosted strengthListen. I'm not running for the Iron Chef here.The AUS-10:X50CrMoV15 vs. AUS10AUS10 wins over the former in terms of edge retention ability. However, X50CrMoV15 is tougher and easier to sharpenThe only thing I have to remind myself is not to drop this knife or try to cut bones, because AUS-10 will chip the knife edge. Other than that, this knife has an ergonomic design (graduation in knife handle to the blade), and it's full tang with a big-ole bolt in the middle out of three bolts to hold it onto its G-10 handle, which is very ideal. Most of my pocket knives have G-10 handles.Yes, of course, I want the CTS XHP Steel kitchen knife with a G-10 handle, but let's be real. My tiny pocket knife cost $110, I can't imagine a kitchen knife costing anything affordable for the average joe.This is a good purchase. Buy it.Edit: I bought one more. The price is too good for this knife. I love using it.",

I have used in our commercial setting several times and sharpened on a steel at least three times. The edge of the blade is showing slight jaggedness, which might be somewhat normal for Damascus steel. But if that continues, the long term result will be a less smooth blade. It seems like there are a lot of knives that advertise \u201cDamascus Steel\u201d but may not actually use that method.",
