I chose the Cuisinart brand knives because I\u2019m familiar with this brand. I\u2019m sure they are dishwasher safe but I tend to hand wash like all of my knives. The hot water of the dishwasher has a tendency to wear the handles down making them look dull (in my opinion). The price was reasonable for the set of 6. I\u2019d definitely recommend this set.",
