                "reviewText": "The Coolina Altomino Chef's Knife was something I'd wanted to try after several failed attempts at searching for a decent chef's knife in this configuration.The knife is sharp-sharp-sharp and holds an edge for quite a while. It does especially well with fruits and vegetables (my primary use for chopping/dicing), but also handles meats well if they are mostly defrosted yet can provide a little resistance when slicing through the meat. (I usually slice chicken or pork with the Coolina, it does well for either application.)If the edge dulls a little, be sure to use a quality 2-step knife sharpener that \"cures\" the edge, then hones it to razor-sharpness. It's wise that once you've finished with the knife that you rinse it with dish soap and water, then dry it immediately and wipe the exposed blade with a paper towel and a little olive oil, then wipe again with a dry paper towel to remove any residual oil. Doing so prevents rust.This product is not stainless-steel, but forged-hardened steel that will rust if neglected. Best to store this either in its cloth bag, or on a magnetic knife strip attached to your kitchen wall.",
