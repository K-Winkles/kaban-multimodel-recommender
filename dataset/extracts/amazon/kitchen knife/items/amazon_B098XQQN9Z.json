                "reviewText": "I am a professional chef, and this is my first time trying a Japanese chef\u2018s knife. I was very surprised by the exquisite craftsmanship of this knife. I love to cook and find that there is nothing more rewarding than preparing a fine meal for myself or others. I looked at many knives and was drawn to the forging method and the attention to detail that Mitsumoto Sakari offers. The gift box is top-notch and well made, and comes with a cool red interior packaging. The knife is a beautiful work of art and do its job effectively and effortlessly. I love the feel and weight of it. The blade is very well made and the pattern is true to the sharpening process. The blade is very sharp, and I know I am going to buy more knives from them. I have seen some comments saying they are \u201dChinese\u201c. I believe there is a bit of discrimination here, or I don\u2018t know if these are malicious comments made by other competitors. I have shown this knife to other colleagues and they all praised it as a top quality Japanese chef\u2019s knife. The seller answered all my questions and gave me more advice and information about the knife. Their brand and forging technology originated from a certain traditional forging family in Yokohama, Japan.If you are considering it, get it and be ready to want another one. When you use it, you will realize what an amazing knife this is.",

It is very sturdy. It feels great not too heavy not too light and doesn\u2019t feel cheap, it\u2019s wonderful and level knife used it on the line in a kitchen for a week now the black started to come off slightly I can see it fading And it also stains a bit with certain foods, but give it a whip it was fine. I think once keep up with the maintenance of the knife it\u2019s a great knife and should last a long time. haven\u2019t sharpened it yet myself but we\u2019ll see what happens. loving it so far",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to write the review I wanted to read before buying a Japanese Gyuto but I couldn't find it, so here it is. I'm 25 and would like eventually like to get a bunch a cool knives since I absolutely love cooking as I would use them as a feature in my kitchen. I've had a Kitchen Aid set, which actually pretty good and it's what I'm comparing this to because I feel like its the typical \"western\" style knife. As you can see, Mitsumoto makes a stunning knife, however it's very thick and top heavy. They could have done a lot better job making it thinner and more balanced. The Kitchen Aid is both thinner and more balanced. It's sharp, yeah, but it isn't any sharper than Kitchen Aid. I already know I'm gonna end up buying a block to sharpen it on. They advertise it as carbon steal, however, that may be inaccurate because the guide that they give you says it's stainless, hmmm... Not sure but I cut an onion and it didn't oxidize \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f BUT it will impress your friends and looks very good. I think it's a good knife but there is a reason why some Gyuto's cost $170. It's a good way to introduce yourself into the style, but I don't know about the longevity and definitely upset it isn't as balanced, thin, or as light as others out there - thats kinda the whole point of a Gyuto... Take a look at this pictures, like I said I wish this review was out there when I was looking around - hope it helps!",

I'm getting old and my other knives wear my hand strength down quickly and my hand hurts for days after doing extensive prep. This knife ended that because it performs well and is well designed. The octagonal handle and the shape of the blade elimates unconfirmed hand positioning i find in European blades. I've cooked professionally for 30 years and I've always wanted a good Japanese blade. This is a mass produced Japanese blade made in China, however it's not a cheap Chinese knockoff. The company is a Japanese company with manufacturing in China. If your looking for authentic hand forged Japanese steel, look elsewhere. If your looking for a well made and beautiful Japanese blade at an affordable price this is the best option I've found on Amazon.",

I took this kirisutke knife out of its fancy display box on Christmas Day of this year to slice/prepare the summer sausage my wife and I received as a gift, and to prepare the ribeye steak strips I would later cook as part of our Christmas dinner. This large, yet nicely balanced knife passed through the sausage and ribeye steak with absolute EASE, without the need to apply much downward pressure.

                "reviewText": "In terms of the actual knife, it's good. It's absolutely a cheap stamped knife, but for the price you cannot go wrong.I'm familiar with all sorts of kitchen knives, high and low end, and this knife held up just fine. It's really hard to go wrong for 60 CAD. The pros were definitely unpacking it (honestly nicer than any high end knife I've ever purchased), and the handle was very well made and comfortable. Balance was okay, and out of the box it was shaving-sharp.There are a couple of cons. (Absolutely nitpicking from a guy who's experienced with knives) They include blade thickness, blade geometry, and the paint coating.Blade thickness is really quite thick, it's not heavy but it affects the cutting performance, especially near the tip of the knife because it is the same thickness as the heel. The sharpness makes up for this somewhat.The blade geometry is okay, definitely a rocking-intended santoku. The blade has quite an aggressive curve similar to a western knife, so if you use a knife with a push-cut or tap-cut style, definitely look elsewhere as you won't cut through the food all the way. Although if you are comfortable with using a rocking motion, this knife will cut just fine.The black paint on the knife is very slightly chipping, but as it's cosmetic I don't have much problem.Looking for a cheap but sharp knife with flexible geometry? You won't be disappointed at all. There's not much this knife couldn't handle.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased three Mitsumoto knives. I own several Japanese knives that are 5 or 6 times the price of this set. In comparison these knives are much better packaged. The center layer of steel is brittle, but thats expected with this type of steel. If you are looking for a knife that you want to abuse and throw in the sink or dishwasher, don\u2019t buy these.I\u2019m extremely impressed with the quality for the price. This steel holds an edge very well and sharpens like a dream using Japanese stones and leather strop.Great value, nice product.",
