Well, after using them just once, I couldn\u2019t part with them. They are a nice color and I made space. The built in sharpener is great. I use one, especially the butcher knife , I hand wash and dry it and run it through the sharpener a couple of times before putting it back in the block. Awesome product.",

                "reviewText": "You get what you pay for with this set. The quality is good but not brilliant. The riveted handles are great & the plastic of the handles does not look or feel cheap. Read the description carefully- there are a lot of utility size knives in this set & only 2 big knives. After using larger chef knives for years I find the knives to be a little on the small side which is good for me as a woman with average hands. I used to avoid my exes (he's a chef) butcher knife like the plague because it was too big to feel comfortable. I don't like that the blades on the 2 bigs tend toward narrow which will make chopping motions a bit more work. I would have preferred an 8 inch santoku knife instead of a 5 inch- it seems to be overkill for utility size knives unless you have a particular affection for that blade shape. The inclusion of an 8 inch bread knife would almost have completed the set, I now have to buy one. There is no butcher's knife which should not matter if you do not require one. The product still got a 4 star review for value for money considering the design/ materials at this price point, & colour (it matches my red kitchen theme). Be sure to read the specifications of this set re: sizing because the set is smaller & narrower than average.",
