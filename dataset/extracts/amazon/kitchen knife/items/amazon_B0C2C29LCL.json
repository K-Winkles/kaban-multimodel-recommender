No more searching because right at hand. Magnet is very strong but not so strong you feel like you have to rip it off the wall. Very happy with this product.",

The magnet is super strong and in my case holds five large knives just fine. It could certainly hold more if needed. Great product, Great price and quick delivery. Over all an AWESOME product and price.",

They stick well, don't slide, and the stainless steel goes with everything else in my kitchen. Wish I'd ordered one years ago instead of the knife block I was using. Really frees up a lot of space when there's not much to spare!",

This one fit perfectly on the side of my cupboard. It is strong enough to hold several knives and utensils. Looks nice. I used three 9 lb command picture frame holders to install it because I'm in a rental and screw holes are a no-no. As the holder itself weighs under 2 lbs, it is very secure installed this way.",

Plus I always use the same 2 knives out of it so what\u2019s the point of having that big thing in my way? This is a great item to keep your knives handy in close reach yet still be able to show off your nice knives & help declutter your countertops. I put out the 4 I\u2019d probably use the most. I could probably add a fifth if I decide it\u2019s necessary. The rest I\u2019m getting rid of or putting in the drawer. It seems to hold them securely. No expected trips to the ER! The wall plate installed easily with 2 screws. I considered using some heavy duty double sided adhesive but the screws seemed a safer option. I like that the main magnet part can come off the wall plate for cleaning. Highly recommend.",
