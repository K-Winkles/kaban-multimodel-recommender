This knife is sharp, cuts well, and comes with a sharpening sleeve (which I have misplaced so it is not pictured, but it did come with it!). I will definitely be buying more of these!***Cons***I would recommend replacing all your knives with sharp ones. We purchased this knife which is very sharp and I accidentally cut myself a little bit because I was so used to how my dull knives cut. That is not a flaw of the product, but instead a flaw in how my dull knives trained me to be lax on kitchen safety and was worth mentioning so that you are more careful. This is a great knife and the sharpness is an attribute. 100% I will be purchasing this again, 5/5 stars. No complaints.",

                "reviewText": "I would like to start by simply saying, you get what you pay for.I am a knife/blade collector, I collect any kinds of blades, whether it be knives, swords, machetes, axes, so I know a good blade when I see/use one. First off, the metal used for this cleaver is very weak. So weak in fact that when I put it in the sheath and took it back out, it got stuck on part of the plastic and it took the edge off that part of the blade. Plastic shouldn't bend or chip metal ever. The cleaver is not very heavy, so if you plan on using this cleaver rather than it being a display piece, save yourself the hassle and get something worth chopping with.As for this not being safe, there are two concerns/observations. First, all around the cleaver where the blade IS NOT, is sharp, like every machined edge is sharp enough to cut yourself on if you arent careful or if your hand slips. Not as sharp as the blade itself, but still something to be aware of. The second safety issue is the positioning of the handle relative to the blade. Its almost like the handle is formed and angled in the perfect way for someone to cut themselves. What I mean by this is when I first held the cleaver, I had uncurled my middle finger(aka extended it out to where its not around the handle) and when I was bringing my finger back to the position around the handle, my finger hit the blade and cut it. Luckily it didn't go deep, but I guarantee it easily could have.Overall, only buy this if you either are going to use it for display or if you want a garbage kitchen tool. The only good thing I can say is that it comes sharp enough to shave hair off my arm.",

I was reluctant to buy this knife because of the price but I pulled the trigger because it had good reviews. I am amazed to get such a great knife for the price. The included sharpening holder is an added bonus. This is perfect for an everyday go to knife. It stays sharp and since it wasn't expensive, I'm not worried about hurting it. It's perfect!!",
