                "reviewText": "This works great as an extra knife holder. We have a wood block that came with a set, but have some extra knives laying around and my wife has since bought some nicer chef knives. This gives us a place to put these extra knives without leaving them in drawers or having to buy extra knife sheaths. This is a little light, which makes the top top heavy when it's full of knives, and this does not hold knives where the handle is longer or heavier than the cutting edge. We have a couple of paring knives where the blade is short but the handle is just as large and heavy as the rest of the set, so when the knife portion is put into this holder, the weight of the handle causes the knife to topple over and there's no friction holding the knife portion in, which can be dangerous. This is primarily best for longer knives. Extra scissor slot is a nice benefit.",

But this knife holder holds everything except one of her knives that has a heavier handle than blade. She's really pleased, and it's easy to wash, too.",
