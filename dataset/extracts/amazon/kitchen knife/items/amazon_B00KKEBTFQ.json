Since then I've owned and used a Victorinox Fibrox, Mercer Santoku, Kiwi Nakiri, Kom Kom and other Target/Faberware/Ikea knives.When it came to chopping onions (which I do a lot) I started to prefer the kiwi nakiri over any other knife I owned. However, nakiris aren't the most versatile knives so sometimes I'd end up needing another knife. I had heard about Japanese knives and really wanted a gyuto. I saw this knife being recommended in a few places and went for it.Man is this knife good! The victorinox really struggles with some onion cuts (probably due to the thick spine), and while my kiwi nakiri is good, this one just seems smoother. It was sharp out of the box and I just love to chop with this knife, it is my new favorite. I'd say it is a great beginner Japanese knife.Have used it for a week so don't know how long the edge will hold but I'm prepared to sharpen it with a whetstone when needed.",

Did not give it a 5* as the handle look and feel cheap even when compared to knife that cost 5 times cheaper. Hope that the blade will hold its sharp edge longer with use. Overall happy with the purchase.Note: After a year of usage, blade holds its sharpness well. Easy to sharpen on fine whetstone or honing rod for razor sharp edge. No sign of stain or rust on blade.",
