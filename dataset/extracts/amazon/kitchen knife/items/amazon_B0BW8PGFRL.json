                "reviewText": "First off I\u2019m a little confused because some of the reviews on here show different knives than the ones I got. I bought this set for my boyfriend and just used them yesterday. They are brand new so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how they hold up. But so far they are fantastic! They are really sharp and have good weight to them. I have small hands and they\u2019re still easy to use. They feel like they\u2019re good quality. Not flimsy at all and so far I feel like the price was on point for what they are.",

I'm by no means a professional/skilled chef and slicing vegetables evenly and meat has always been a bit of a challenge for me. Since I've started using this knife, I'm able to cut meat all the way through when dicing on the first slice, I can cut vegetables a lot more even and quicker. I love the look of this knife and the feel, I could tell it was a very good quality knife as soon as I took it out of it's case, I plan on ordering more of the set to match. I also love that it came with it's own case, I keep the knife in it whenever I'm not using it.As of yet, I haven't put this kinfe in the dishwasher, I'm only wash it by hand because I've been told that it's better to never put knives in the dishwasher because the heat it too much. Not sure if this is 100% true but I want to take the best care of this knife so it can have the longest life possible.Knife was packaged well and arrived quickly after ordering.",

They are a single piece of steel with no bolts or screws or fittings or embedded handles.

There\u2019s also no loose handles and no ergonomic issues to worry about in the future. I like them so much I bought two sets!",
