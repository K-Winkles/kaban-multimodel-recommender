                "reviewText": "As a former chef, I know the importance of having a good sharp knife. I've used a lot of different brands over the years and have most recently had a reliable set of Global knives in my home kitchen. They're well used and have retained sharpness well with regular honing. They're lighter than these All-Clad knives, but that's a matter of personal preference. As far as durability, balance, beauty, and sharpness, I'd put this starter set of All-Clad knives on par with my Globals.The All-Clad knives are very well-balanced and feel comfortable in my hand. They are a bit heavier, as I mentioned, but that's not necessarily a downside. I like a knife that is a bit more substantial without being so heavy as to quickly cause hand fatigue. These are in that *sweet spot.* This is a nice starter set that has the three knives I'd definitely want in my kit if I suddenly found myself without any knives. An 8\" Chef, a serrated utility, and a paring knife. With those three knives, you can accomplish virtually everything you need to in the kitchen. I love, love, love that the utility is serrated because it gives it the added versatility of a bread knife or tomato knife without blinking an eye. They come as a set but are individually boxed, so you could easily give them as gifts if you wanted to. All-Clad is a little pricey, but you're getting outstanding quality and long-term durability, meaning it's money well spent. These knives are definitely sharp, which is important - a dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp knife since you have to exert more pressure to use it, meaning if you cut yourself, you're likely to do more damage, and dull knives don't cut as \"cleanly\" as sharp ones either. To test that, try to slice a tomato with a dull knife and then with a sharp knife and you'll see what I mean.Overall, this is a near-perfect starter knife set and would make a great housewarming or wedding gift for those just starting out. It's also a nice addition if you use your knives several times a day like I do and you want the convenience of a spare chef or paring knife around. The serrated utility is a game changer and I suspect it's going to be the most-used/loved knife in this set for me just for it's overall versatility. If you're comparing these to other brands, I'd say they're on par (quality-wise) with Global and Messermeister, and a big step up from Henckels or Chicago Cutlery. At the end of the day, what knives you choose for your kitchen is a largely personal decision, since it has to feel comfortable in *your* hand and it has to have a weight and balance that works for you as an individual. That said, if you like the *feel* of these, they are the All-Clad quality you can count on and will provide many years of reliable service with proper care (translation: don't put them in the dishwasher, don't drop them, and hone properly as needed). I've never gotten any All-Clad products (and I have a lot of All-Clad in my kitchen) that haven't impressed me - their craftsmanship is top notch - and they stand behind it. What more could you ask for when investing in a good knife set?",

                "reviewText": "This review is for the All-Clad Forged Steel 3-Piece Knife Set, which includes an 8\" chef's knife, a serrated 5\" utility knife, and a 3.5\" paring knife. The knives use the classic X50CrMoV15 German stainless steel formula, which is well-regarded for its balance of durability, corrosion resistance, ability to retain a sharp edge, and ease of sharpening. I have several \"nice\" knives from W\u00fcsthof, Zwilling J.A. Henckels, and Made In that use this exact formulation, and they're the stalwarts of our kitchen.The profile of the All-Clad chef knife is more reminiscent of the Japanese Gyuto, with less curvature from heel to tip, resulting in a flatter edge compared to classic Western chef knives. This is good if you tend to pick up the knife when you cut, but it's not ideal if you prefer to keep the knife's tip on the cutting board and cut in a rocking motion. These knives feature a half-bolster design, which is a plus in my book since it makes sharpening more straightforward, and I can use the entire length of the blade, but it also means beginners need to be more careful since there's no finger guard.In my opinion, these All-Clad knives are a good value, with all three knives costing less than the current going price of a W\u00fcsthof Classic Chef Knife . The knives are sharp out of the box, and I like how they're individually packaged. They're well-made, comfortable in hand, and immediately familiar.",

                "reviewText": "I like All-Clad pans so jumped on the chance to try their knives. Historically I have not been a big spender on knives so my only reference for comparison is the winning knife from ATK's \"best chef's knives under $75\" from several years ago. I did not have a serrated knife in this size, just a long serrated bread knife. I have an old paring knife but rarely use it, and probably won\u2019t use this one much either. I'm pretty happy with the All-Clad knife set. They are a little heavier than my old knives but not too bulky or hefty, it feels really good to hold. The handle doesn't get slippery. And they are quite sharp! The 8\" chef's knife is great for all purpose chopping- I've used on onions, rhubarb, carrots, herbs and lots of other stuff and it's been great. The serrated knife was perfect for slicing my small garden tomatoes without crushing them, and slicing lemons, probably any fruit of a certain size. I have not been good about keeping my knives sharp, so when comparing these knives to the ones I've been using (when they were brand new), these knives do feel a little better to use. All knives will get dull with use, so I'll make more effort to sharpen them once in awhile, they seem durable and should last a long time if cared for properly.",

                "reviewText": "All-Clad is a brand known for their high quality cookware. I am not familiar with their knives but decided to take the chance on these because of their relatively reasonable price -- a single quality knife can cost as much as this whole set -- and the trust I have in the brand otherwise. I'm glad I gave them a try! This set of knives includes a paring knife, a mid-sized slightly serrated utility knife, and a chef's knife. They have a satisfying weight and cut through even the most difficult foods with ease. The utility knife works extremely well on the tough skins of tomatoes without crushing the soft interior; the chef's knife chops through onions while allowing them to keep their shape. (They are extremely sharp! At a glance it's not obvious which is the cutting edge and which is the back edge, and in a careless moment I gave my fingers very sharp, thin cuts, which were so clean that they healed very quickly.) I only wish they came with a permanent sheath or a knife block, as the paper sheaths are not ideal for the knives to be kicking around in in a drawer. These are definitely a step up from my current elderly knives. I'd be happy to try even more All-Clad knives!",
