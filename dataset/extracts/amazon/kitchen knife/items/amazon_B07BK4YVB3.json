                "reviewText": "I'm pretty picky about kitchen knifes. Over the years I've collect many knifes in the kitchen and still haven't settled with my favorite one. Recently one of my friends recommended this Paudin 8\" chef's knife. From the picture, I like the wood grain design etched on the blade, which makes it so unique. So I decided to give it a try. The $25.99 price tag (after a$10 coupon, maybe they're running a promotion?) is very reasonable, so it won't go wrong even if it is not as good as I expected. Well, this product acctually really exceeded my expectation when I received it and got hold to it.Its weight gives me very nice solid feel, but not too heavy. The blade and handle are very well balanced. The handle is smooth and very comfortble to hold. The edge feels so sharp to the touch, so I decided to test it. I put a stack of 20 pages of printer paper and tried to slice cut a half inch corner off. To my surprise, I didn't have to do a slicing motion, just press down and the stack of paper got cut through eazily. That's really beyond my expection. I then used it to cut meat and veggie. The knife felt so sharp making all the cutting so eazy. And the curve of the edge feels just right. Well, there is only one minor issue with this product, same as all the knife that I have, the back of the knife is square and clean. But I have a habbit to press on the back of the knife during cutting, especially the closer to the handle part. I would like a knife that has rounded edge at the back near the handle, though I haven't seen one so far.I don't normally write a product review, unless I really like or really hate the product. This time is the former, have to share the good experience with people. To summarize, this is well made kitchen knife with high quarlity. I will use it as my main kitchen knife now. Will see how long it will keep this sharp.",

                "reviewText": "I'm very happy with my purchase, but I think I made a mistake in buying this knife. I wanted a solid, all-purpose, high quality, Western-style chef's knife. What I got was that, and a piece of art that is just too beautiful to risk using. It would feel like hanging your laundry on Michelangelo's Pieta, or using a limited edition Lord of the Rings to press garlic. Don't get me wrong, this blade is solid, heavy without being overbearing, insanely sharp, ergonomic, and an overall pleasure to use...but it's just so PRETTY! I want to put it in a case over my mantel. The Damascus marbling is gorgeous, the bolster is perfect for a pinch grip, the balance is spot-on, it goes through veggies without any effort (I've had dreams of potato-chopping with more effort) and it does the heavy lifting like Arnold in his prime. I've only used it for a few days, but it seems to hold its edge very well, with just a little use of a honing rod. I know eventually the newness will wear off and this will become my favorite tool; but for now, I just like looking at it.",
