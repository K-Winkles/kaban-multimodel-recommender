They are good knives, easy to hold, I don't kill my wrist trying to slice something, they will do most jobs you need to do in the kitchen.Take good care of them, keep the edges sharp, and keep them in their protective covers they come with while in your drawer. Also hand-wash in hot water with soap rather than in the dishwasher, dry with kitchen towel, and slide them back into the cardboard sheath. Voila!So, I got two more sets! Worth the money!",
