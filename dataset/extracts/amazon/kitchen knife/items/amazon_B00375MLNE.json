I guess it hadn't been fed in a while because it bit me, hard, on the finger. It was a deep, gushing cut, too; the kind that keeps reopeneing days after you've bandaged it up. I cleaned my finger up and then finished washing the knife up. The next day, BAM! it bit my wife! TWICE!! In my mind I swear it heard it whispering \"cut cut cut cut cut\" like Space Ghost in that episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast. Anyway, I said a little prayer over it and did what I could to exorcise the hungry, cutty spirit from it. Since then it's been totally fine. Overall a good, sharp knife.",

This is the closest I could find as a replacement (previous knife is not made anymore). Cuts a ittle different as the old knife had double serrations and this knife just one side. But it is super sharp. Already cut through a half inch of thumbnail and thumb.- didn't even feel pain until much later. Has good weight and balance and is a good, inexpensive 5 inch blade serrated knife. Does the job for me.",
