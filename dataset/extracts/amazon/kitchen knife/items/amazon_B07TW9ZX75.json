These look great and don\u2019t seem like they\u2019ll split or lose the soft lining with use.Only downside is I wish they had set options with fewer pieces. As it is now you can get a great deal on the huge set, not use half of them and end up trying to make some work that don\u2019t exactly fit your knives. Or you can buy individually just the ones that do fit and pay 5x as much. Sure would be nice to have the option of some mid-priced sets of 3 or even 5 to make things a little more easily customizable.",
