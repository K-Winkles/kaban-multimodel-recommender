                "reviewText": "Our old set of kitchen knives were a wedding present from many years ago and were virtually impossible to keep sharp. This set is amazing. We had no idea how bod our old set had gotten until we replaced them. These cut wonderfully and seem to hold an edge quite well. I hone them with a Henckels sharpener I purchased separately to keep that nice edge. These are well worth the price to make kitchen work much easier and more enjoyable.",
