                "reviewText": "I spent 10 minutes installing this. It took that long because I had to pull out my drill and level, not because it was that hard. I chose to install with the wall anchors, which seem good enough to me, instead of adhesive, so I can't speak to the effectiveness of that option. The holes are large enough that I could use a pencil lead to mark the holes without any issue. The only question mark on this is that, yes, it comes with wooden plugs to put over the screw holes, but they do not sit flush, friction fit, or come with a way to remove them. I'm a bit nervous to figure out how to remove it since I can't fit anything around it, and I can't just tip the block over to spill them out since it's attached to the wall. Maybe a vacuum?Nonetheless, it dresses the kitchen up, holds onto knives tight, and gets the knives out of our drawer. For the price, it's hard to find a better option.",

                "reviewText": "I have this stuck to the side of my fridge. I love the look. One thing I did notice it that my fridge side has a slight arc so it does not fit flush. When mounting the adhesive, I screwed the adhesive on the holder, placed it on the fridge and then removed the screws and the holder. Then I firmly pressed the ahdesive on to the fridge and reinstalled the holder.My coutertop space is limited and this freed up a bunch of space by removing the wood block holder.",

                "reviewText": "This knife holder is fantastic! I love to cook, so I have a few knives. Keeping them in my drawer or having them in a knife block was just taking up space that I needed for other appliances and tools, however, this knife holder takes care of that problem. Here are my Pros and Cons for this product: Pros- It helps me maximize the small kitchen space I have, letting me focus what's important... Food- The wood finish looks great and helps show off the cooking arsenal- The magnets are pretty strong, so you don't have to worry about the knives falling off and damaging someone or themselves, if you were to bump something into it- The adhesion is strong, and you don't have to drill into the wall and damage it. (I messed up my placement the first time and pulled it off to readjust the strip, and I don't have any problems with staying on the wall.) Cons- The magnets do not keep the knives from turning very well since it can pivot on the one row of magnets- The wood finish could be a little thicker. I have only had this for a little while, and there are already a few scratches/cuts on the surfaceAltogether though, I really enjoy this product. The Price and Quality give it a full 5 stars for me. Hopefully this review can help you figure out if this is the right product for you and your kitchen.",

                "reviewText": "This knife set is definitely worth the money. The knives seem to be very high quality & are every bit as sharp as my surgical scalpels. They glide through raw beef with almost no pressure. The steak knives aren't bad, but the serrated area is too long & takes some getting used to. The keeper block is solid wood & is heavy enough that it won't tip or move around on the counter. The rest of the accessories are decent cheap quality & should last a long time. The sharpener looks robust & is of the type that puts the very best edges onto knives. The shears are strongly built & very sharp, although I wouldn't use them on steel cans. All in all, this set is a great bargain.",
