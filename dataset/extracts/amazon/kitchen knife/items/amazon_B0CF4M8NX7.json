My husband's hands are much bigger than mine, so they don't fit him as well, but I do a majority of the cooking, so I'm pleased with them. Love the color coordinated covers, as my previous knives didn't have that and I keep them in a drawer. Highly recommend these knives.",

                "reviewText": "My household is full of aspiring chefs, so an extra knife set is always worth a try.Good features:Made from 3cr13 stainless steel which is a common, mid-grade blade suitable for consumers' daily kitchen use.Nice, comfortable, and ergonomic handles for a good grip.The color coating provides quick ID of knife and additional corrosion, cutting lubricity (non-stick), and stain resistance, leaving ~0.5mm of uncoated blade cutting edge.Weight and balance of knives feel alright.A variety of 6 knives: Chef, Slicing, Bread, Santoku (\"3 purposes'), Utility, and Paring for a wide range of uses.Blades are sharp and slice, dice, mince, and pare well.Includes safety sheath for each knife.Concerns:Vendor doesn't disclose how the blades were coated. Textured powder coats?Don't know about edge retention (how long the knives will stay sharp) and ease of sharpening.Colorful knives look almost toylike. Keep out of reach of children!",
