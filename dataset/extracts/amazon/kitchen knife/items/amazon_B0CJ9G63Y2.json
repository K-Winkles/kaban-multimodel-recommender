                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Any time you see Pakka wood it\u2019s your first hint of a lower quality product. It\u2019s like substituting basa fish for sea bass. It\u2019s just not the same by a long way. This knife came very poorly packaged in a difficult to remove blister pack that develops sharp edges as you scissor it open. Once you get the knife out you\u2019ll see the poorly hewn handle where mine had bumps and imperfections on it. No clue if this is full tang as it feels too light but does have a metal end piece. Blade appears nice like Demarcus style but this also my just be a pattern. The ballade is pretty nice and stylish though if you ignore their giant logo.",
