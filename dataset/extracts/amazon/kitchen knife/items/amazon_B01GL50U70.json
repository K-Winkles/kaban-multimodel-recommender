                "reviewText": "Hard to imagine that I got this knife, but for the size of the blade I couldn\u2019t get a better price. First impression is fantastic, looks great, feels great even for the size of the knife not \u201ctoo\u201d heavy. It came in a box and razor sharp out of the box. Blade feels of high quality like my German forged knifes. The knife itself is not forged but it is certainly well heat treated as the blade springs back very easily back to original position when flexed. It is most certainly stamped from high quality blank, and has very fine machined surface and ground to a fine finish. The cutting edge of the blade has a funky angle as it is machine ground and not polished or honed. Either way it came razor sharp out of the box and sliced like my High End Japanese Yanagiba knife. The best part is the wood handle, I did not want to let go Of this thing once I started slicing with it. It just feels really at home in my hand. I have knifes that cost 7 times as much that are not as comfortable to grub as this one. I am not 100% convinced it is a full tang knife just doesn't feel like one but maybe it is the length of the blade that throws the balance forward of the knife. Esthetics are great, my Japanese knifes are better but this is very good. It would be much nicer if the actual spine was polished not ground but I guess for $40 it\u2019s what you pay for. Bolster is most probably welded on but is well blended and ground to match the thickness of the blade. I hope the blade is easy to sharpen like my German knives. Really this thing is very impressive.",

                "reviewText": "Full disclosure: I'm a bit of a kitchen knife junkie. Got way more than I will ever need, though that is beside the point. I have some expensive knives (Shun, Zwilling, and others) and as a sort of hobby collect various brands to try. This is the first TUO Phoenix series knife, and it is wonderful. The quality is great, the balance among the best, and it came really sharp. Then there are the esthetics -- this is plainly a beautifully knife with the pakkawood grainy handle. Itis somewhat lighter than some other nakiri knives I have used. The beveled bolster is both graceful and useful - it makes the pinch grip easier to use. So I keep coming back to this knife for daily use. Could not recommend any higher. But I love my Shun Classic knives too.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not kidding, this is a fantastic knife for the price. I wanted a not-too-small-not-too-big general knife.The pairing knife from my otherwise excellent German knife set was too small and the small chef knife was too big. This knife is just right for many of the misc small cutting jobs. Jobs when you only need to cut a few of something like cucumbers, mushrooms, celery, carrots etc.The handle is easy to hold and doesn't slip in my medium sized hands. Besides, it looks beautiful with the fiery-red coloring. It very much stands out in the otherwise boring black block set.The blade is very sturdy. Far less flex that the smaller German pairing knife I'd likely compare it to. It's sharp... and has stayed sharp. Keep in mind that I'm not a knife neanderthal that can't be bothered to grab a cutting board. I use a cutting board, but also use the knife a bunch. I've not felt even close to busting out the knife sharpener.If you have made it this far in the, I have to note that this is now the second knife from this fiery red style that I *purchased*. No freebie knife-for-review here. I bought the second knife, since I loved the first so much.Here's my only very minor issue... I'd like to have the handle coated/protected/poly'd... I never let my wood handled knives set in water nor dumb enough to place in the dish washer. I use them and immediately clean then dry them. On the other hand, the feel of that wood handle is very good.",
