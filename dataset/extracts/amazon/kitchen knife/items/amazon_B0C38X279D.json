I bought it for hunting & fishing but tested it in my professional kitchen....and I love it!!! Beautiful thick wood handle that curves coupled with the finger hole in the blade makes for a perfect ergonomic fit. Like, it fits so absolutely perfectly it's a true arm extension tool that handles perfectly and yes, it can be used as a defensive weapon (against bears, of course). The blade is definitely the coolest one yet, super sharp as usual with a beautiful hand-forged pattern. The dimples are beautifully decorative and help to keep food from sticking, the jagged side is perfect for fish scaling and scoring meat. The sheath makes it perfectly convenient for carrying anywhere. And of course the price makes it hands down the best deal anywhere for a knife of this quality with these features. As a chef and an outdoorsman I totally endorse this this product.",

                "reviewText": "YES !!! This Huusk 9\u201d Kiritsuke chef knife is everything I dreamed of all in one knife. Every detail of this knife SCREAMS flawlessly ultimate quality! The handle fits my hand perfectly and is machined as smooth as silk. The 9\u201d blade length is the length I\u2019ve been looking for. The weight and balance of this knife is beyond my wildest expectations for my comfort and feeling like it\u2019s an extension of my arm that I was born with. The hammered dimpling on the blade \u201creleases\u201d every type of food that I gently stroke through with no sticking whatsoever. And sharpness ?!? Oh my! Beef, tomatoes, onions, celery and a hard baguette that I stroked through today for my first use felt like THEY WEREN\u2019T EVEN THERE ! Thank you, Huusk !!!",

Huusk japan is the name, not!!! where its made. I know a respected knife maker and he says a hand forged knife like this would be hundreds of dollars and many days to make. Its all marketing lies and hype. They use \"pot\" metal for the blades only a slight step above Pakistan made knives. Now are they worthless? No. Your not getting even a hint of what they say your getting except for metal content.",
