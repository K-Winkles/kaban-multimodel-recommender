That's all.Of all the chef knife that I've used in my lifetime, this chef knife ranks just as high as the other normal knives that \"works when I need it to work.\"... which is when I need to cut or chop something.It has one job and one job only. And it works, when I need it to. So, for that, I give it 5 stars.Now, you may ask, is it an exceptional chef knife?No. No, it is not. It's a very typical chef knife. It's not that kind of knife like those ceramic knife that cuts food like butter. You won't fall in love with this knife. And you won't hate it, either. It's a good chef knife. That's all it is.",
