Having the right tools makes everything safer and more fun.This set is well packaged and well designed for smaller hands. The blades have rounded tips to help prevent accidental pokes. The blades are also sharp enough out of the box to start working right away. They've held an edge through quite a bit of use and have only needed some minor touch ups. Not a huge fan of the holes in the blades as this is a great place for food to get stuck, but it's not bad. Also a through-tang blade would help with balance and help to create proper technique. Minor quibbles though for a nice beginner set.The other accessories in the kit, the peeler and finger guard, are also good quality.",

They have been using child-safe plastic knives, which do work surprisingly well, but some of the kids are getting older and ready to graduate to a metal knife. This set of 2 knives and a scraper provide a perfect transition to the time that they\u2019ll be ready to graduate to regular knives. The blades are sharp enough to easily slice up a bunch of carrots. The only issue I had was that the handle is small, so it was a little hard to use, but I persevered. Both the larger knife and the paring knife cut well. The safely feature is that the tip of the knife is rounded. I was able to peel the carrots with the scraper as easily as when I peel with my high-end scraper. In addition to the rounded blade tips, there are other safely features. One is a pair of gloves that will protect hands from getting cut, plus a metal finger guard.",
