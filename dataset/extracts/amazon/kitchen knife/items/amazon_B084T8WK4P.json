                "reviewText": "I bought this knife because I had a Henkel knife I have used for many years; recently although the knife still cut very well, the handle began to disintegrate. I bought the knife that was the same size and description as mine. It will not cut! We tried to sharpen it several times but nothing works! I have put duct tape around the handle of my old knife and will use it until I find a knife that cuts! So disappointed.Update: I contacted the company (after returning the knife and receiving my refund from Amazon) and the company was so gracious and sent me a lovely SHARP knife which I am using gratefully! Problem resolved",
