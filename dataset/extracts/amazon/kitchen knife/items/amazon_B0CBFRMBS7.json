I\u2019ve purchased several cookbooks focusing on foods around the world, so it made sense to buy knives my littles can use to help in the kitchen. I also ordered colorful cutting boards. I like that these are stainless steel and not plastic!! They\u2019re also irresistibly cute. My 9, 6 and 3 year olds have used the knives to cut apples and bananas as a trial run. I give these knives 5 stars. They come in a handy little storage box too. Well worth the money.",

These work great, cut tomatoes, mushrooms, lettuce, fruits. All without crushing them into a horrible and messy pulp. Definitely worth it to get kids interested in cooking. We're losing too many family recipes. Get them involved, keep the legacy alive!",
