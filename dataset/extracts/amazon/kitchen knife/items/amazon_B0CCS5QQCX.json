The handle on the 8\" chef's knife is somewhat better than the handle on the paring knife, simply because it is larger and thicker. Both knives come with a plastic sheath, which is nice for storing.I took off one star due to the knife handles.This set is currently valued less than $10 which I think is a great value.",
