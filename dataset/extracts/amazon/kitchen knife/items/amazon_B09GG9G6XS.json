They're easy to install... you can just stick the magnet strip to your wall & put the knives right on it. They look really nice, and add a modern touch to my kitchen that I didn't know I was missing before! They're still VERY sharp after 4 months of use. No complaints about quality... no complaints at all!!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I was in the search for some good quality knifes that came with a magnet wall mount instead of a knife block. (Counter space is very limited in a RV.) The adhesive was a perfect option since you don\u2019t want to really drill screws into the paper thin walls. The adhesive is very strong and durable, is not coming loose at all. Magnets are also the perfect blend of strong without being too strong.I grew up and swear by Cutco knives. These are a great sharp and affordable substitute.",

                "reviewTitle": "Comparable to knives that are twice its price",
                "reviewText": "My high rating factors in the low price of this knife.At this price, my hopes weren't very high. The photos are nice enough, but I've been misled before.Right off the bat, the packaging is very nice and certainly giftable. The sturdy and attractive thick cardboard box comes shrink wrapped so that the contents can't go flying off during shipping. Within the padded box, the knife itself came with tip guards and plastic wrapping around the entire knife, plus additional plastic wrapping around the handle. This knife was NOT going to be damaged during shipping!I'll start with my only minor gripe: the handle looks and feels cheap and not very robust. But the blade! It doesn't belong on such an inexpensive knife! The VG10 steel, one of my favorites for kitchen knives, is already uncommon at this price, but it's also beautifully constructed and finished. The uraoshi, the top and bottom part of the \"back\" of the knife, isn't very pronounced, so I'm not sure how it will feel to sharpen it. But the urasuki, the concave part, is well defined and deep enough that it won't disappear after a few sessions on the sharpening stones. After reading some of the reviews, I was prepared to have to sharpen it when it arrived, but mine was razor sharp right out of the box. Given my light use and the hardness of VG10 steel, I don't expect to need to sharpen it for quite a few months. The weight is quite substantial for its relatively short length -- you notice it even when you pick up the box for the first time -- so the weight of the knife will easily do most of the work when slicing soft proteins. Naturally, with a long knife with a light wooden handle, the center of mass will be forward on the blade, but I find that it feels quite nimble and I don't feel like the tip is trying to get away from me.If this exact blade had the name \"Tojiro\" stamped on it and I paid twice as much, I would have thought that I caught an amazing deal. Frankly, a name like \"Gourmetop\" doesn't inspire confidence. But if they keep making knives like this one, they'll build themselves a solid reputation.Unless you're a professional chef or a collector of high end Japanese knives, I can definitely recommend this yanagiba. And the only reason a professional chef would probably not use it is that it's too short for professional use. But for the home? Go for it!",
