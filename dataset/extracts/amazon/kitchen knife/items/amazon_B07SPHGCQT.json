                "reviewText": "I own a lot of different types of knives and different brands. I'm not a professional chef by any means, just your average home cook, cooking about 7 meals a week and very rarely some type of sweet baked goods. My go-to knives are usually my Wusthof 6\" chef's knife and my KitchenAid 7\" santoku knife. In my never-ending quest of searching for better cooking tools, I came across this Orblue knife. I purchased the 8\" cooking knife, which is the longest blade I've owned so far. I wasn't really expecting much for a cheap knife $23 knife, anticipating it to be decent like my KitchenAid santoku blade which was similarly $20 in price. I was impressed with how it was packaged and the overall quality. If this was given as a gift, you could have fooled me into thinking this was a $70+ knife. The weight of it is heavier than I expected, definitely heavier than a Wusthof knife, but I prefer heavier knives over lighter. The blade is extremely sharp, well-crafted with a real wooden handle and a stamped metal base. The woodgrain pattern is seemingly etched but in a way that there are no grooves to potentially catch onto ingredients you're chopping. The blade is fantastic, on par with my Wusthof knife, back in its glory days of new, before I let the blade dull and haven't gotten it professionally resharpened yet. It's powerful enough to cut through large sweet potatoes and delicate enough to slice a Roma tomato without completely squishing it. It can mince garlic and fresh herbs like sage and cilantro finer and faster than my other blades. It's also great for carving roast chicken and chopping or filleting raw meat, it's even great for cleaning fish. It's a truly versatile knife. Like other thicker-bladed knives, it's not ideal for chopping butternut squash or melons with tough skin - a cleaver is what you need for those. But for your assorted everyday ingredients, this knife is great! It's my #1 knife in the drawer and my go-to for cooking now. The reviews for the knives seem to include the other varieties, which I read a lot of sarcastic reviews for the bread knife. Ignore those and definitely go with the 8\" cooking knife! I'm definitely buying another one for my sister for her birthday.",

We were very pleasantly surprised by the nice packaging and the feel and quality of the knife. Nicely balanced and very sharp. Also, a great deal for the price. It is working just as well and looks just as nice as our other knives that we spent a lot more on. Overall, very impressed!",

                "reviewText": "This knife looks and feels really amazing. It isn't the sharpest knife in the world, but with a little bit of sharpening I think it could be a near professional quality knife. For the price however I think it's unbeatable. It's not bulky like most other knives in this price range, and the design on the blade looks amazing. I think this would make a great addition to any kitchen, and also a really great gift for someone who likes to cook and could use a nicer knife. As someone who owns and frequently uses professional grade knives, this knife definitely seems like it's worth more than what it costs.",
