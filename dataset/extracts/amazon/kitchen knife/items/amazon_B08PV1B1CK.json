                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Handle felt very slightly loose and bottle opener feature is useless, but HOLY CRAP it's sharp!",
                "reviewText": "Since I'd been cooking more and more often lately and most of the knives I had were perpetually dull, I figured I'd get myself my own signature chef's knife (please note I'm at best an amateur home chef and I mainly got this over a standard stainless steel knife because it was cool looking.)This knife is freaking awesome, but it does have a few slight flaws; first is less a flaw and more a caveat of this particular kind of knife. It's a high carbon steel knife, and for those unknowing of what this means (much like me AFTER I bought this) it means it stays sharper for longer and has a nice finish to it, but it is high maintenance in that you mush hand wash it immediately after using it and dry it just as soon as well as oil it every so often, just to keep it from rusting. Personally I can deal with the cleaning and oiling (got food grade mineral oil shortly after), but I also noticed that the handle is slightly loose. Again, not that big of a deal and it could just be the one that I got but it may bug some. The leather sheathe is a nice addition and so far have had no problems with it.And finally the infamous bottle opener on it; if you read any other reviews here then let me just confirm also yes it doesn't work, it's too big to fit under a typical bottle cap for a beer or whatever would require a bottle opener. Can't speak on it's other supposed uses outside of the kitchen but regardless of all of this, as a knife, this thing is terrifyingly sharp! when I scored some meat with it I barely used any pressure and the knife left deep gashes after gliding across it! It's so sharp if I'm not careful taking it out of the holder it will start cutting the strap that holds it in and considering how clumsy I can be, the sharpness is disconcerting but appreciated!So given the price I'd say this was well worth the purchase; Get a bit of mineral oil (I think cooking oil works too in a pinch) and keep it clean and don't rely on it for opening your beer and I'd say you have a pretty solid knife for your uses.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this for my other half as a Christmas gift to add to his knife collection. As a professional meat cutter, he knows knives and he was very impressed with the quality and workmanship of this one! I, on the other hand, know nothing about knives and picked this one because I liked the way the dragon head looked. In a nutshell, he got quality and I got pretty! This was a win-win gifting situation all the way around!!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Good for the money, minor flaws that can be fixed, every picture on the listing is a photoshop.",
                "reviewText": "Pros: Low cost, hard carbon steel, will uncomfortably shave arm hair out of the box, good cleaver weight, not to heavy or tiring, tight construction, good edge retention, thick spine, good profile, coated on non cutting surface to preserve steel, nice and well constructed leather sheath.Cons: Not a single one of the photos ares actually of this knife being used. Every single one of them is a fake photoshop picture. Indentations are not hammer marks but rather fake \"hand forged\" appearance, \"carbon\" coating is sprayed on, coating goes down the profile cutting surface when it shouldn't, edge has a slight curve but mine has a mis-grind and there is a straight portion in that blade curvature, bottle opener is to blunted to work, blade maintenance (oil to protect and difficult to sharpen hard steel).Overall: This knife looks great and will be an amazing functional accessory for my flat black offset smoker. And for as cheap as this knife is, all of the cons except the edge grind creating that flat spot are easily resolved and 95% worth it. That one flat spot is going to be an absolute P.I.T.A. to fix, even with my belt sanders. The knife is not shave sharp, it will shave hair, but the razer burn would be insane, so it's not shave sharp. Some good stropping takes this knife a very, very long ways. (It is quite sharp enough for most peoples use in the kichen.) The feel of the blade is heavier than most kitchen knives but lighter than most bushcraft knives. It will strike a ferro rod. I like the utility and overall style of the knife and it does make an excellent cleaver and chopper. I don't believe I would take it as my primary knife on a camping trip in the mountains, but I may take it next time just to abuse it a little and see how it holds up next to my equally cheap Shrade and Mora, as well as my much more expensive elmax First Edge bk5050. So far, I'm please with this knife.",
