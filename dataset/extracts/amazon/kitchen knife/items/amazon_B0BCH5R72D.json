Nice size handle to grip with love that they are a little bigger and feel more substantial in your hand. It\u2019s nice to have a straight edge and serrated. Good value for your $$$. I would expect nothing less from GZ.Beware: these are very very sharp and you have probably been using dull blades so keep your fingers tucked in.",

                "reviewText": "The knives look and feel good, have a nice weight and good balance. The blades have a confidence instilling height and thickness, are full tang, and a secured with three rivets to the handle. The seated knife is a nice tomato slicer. The straight blade came very sharp out of the box became dull during its first use prepping, cutting bell peppers, onions, and zucchinis on a wooden board. Honing didn't help but a quick 300-1000-6000 whetstone treatment got it back to great sharpness. I then cored some jalapenos, cut some corn of the ear, and diced onions, but the blade was already dull when it came to the tomatoes. I should have invested more money and not be intrigued by the knives' looks.",

Slice threw any fruit or vegetable with no effort at all. I can easily peel squash with this. I use the smooth bladed one all the time. Having a small, serrated knife is a game changer for me. It comes in handy. I keep them on a magnetic strip. My go-to knives. The quality is superb. I expect these to last a ling, long time. I am so delighted with this knife set.",
