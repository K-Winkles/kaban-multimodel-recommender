So I was surprised to see regular recommendations for this knife brand with glowing reviews. I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the knives given the price. If you are looking to try a different style knife, i.e. bunka or Gyuto but don't want to spend the big bucks on a \"real\" knife, then these are your next best bet. They get the job done, hold a very fine edge, are easy to sharpen, and did I mention cheap? The handles can be a little rough, but what do you expect for the price?",
