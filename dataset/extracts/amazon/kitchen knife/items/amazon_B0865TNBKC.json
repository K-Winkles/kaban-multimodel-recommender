La hoja recta ayuda a picar tambien y la hoja no es super gruesa para que complique cortar papas o cosas que tengan una densidad superior. El cuchillo tiene el tama\u00f1o perfecto para mi ya que me permite maniobrarlo mas facilmente y tener mas precision en el corte. Lo unico es que me hubiera gustado es que al menos venga con una funda de plastico como la que vino mi otro cuchillo para cuidar el filo porque ahora la tengo que comprar la funda aparte. En lineas generales, estoy muy contenta con la compra.",
