I don't know that I'd want to peel enough apples for a pie with one of these, but for most quick uses they are just fine. I don't have a dishwasher, so I don't know how they'd hold up to that. The only downside is that the plastic covers just slide right off too easily. Gravity will pull them off. But hey, for the price, at least they come with the sleeves.",
