To me, it feels light, which may be due to the wooden handle. But, the balance it alright. Since the handle is not coated, I would hand wash it only. Using a dishwasher might damage the handle.It is nice and sharp right out of the box. It sliced very easily through tomatoes and lettuce. I don't use my knives on meats since I am vegetarian, so I can't speak to how well it will cut meats. But, it seems to be fine as an all-around vegetable knife in my kitchen so far. I have no complaints other than the handle feels a bit light in the hand. It is perfectly functional and does a great job. It's a nice budget chef knife, in my opinion.",

                "reviewText": "Excellent 8 inch chef's knife that looks good, performs well, and is a good value.The blade is razor sharp, and heavy enough to make short work of cubing even very dense foods like large sweet potatoes. (See photo.) It always makes me nervous to have to chop through dense vegetables but this knife just glided right through.The wooden handle is attractive and well balanced; and the knife feels comfortable in the hand.Recommended.",

                "reviewText": "Really sharp knife. The handle is a little rough to the hand as it is made with raw wood. There is no finish on the handle so not sure how long it will hold up. I did add some olive oil to it to see if I could protect it a little better. It is a very sharp knife though which I really like. It is my \"go to\" knife now when in the kitchen. I may take some sandpaper to the handle to smooth it out. Not sure how many people would want to do that though.",
