I'm assuming this was just a miss during production. This is my second, and I am pleased with the product.",

                "reviewText": "After purchasing the same style knife block previously from a different seller I knew I needed another. I decided to try this Bambusi brand since it is the same exact size and costs quite a bit less than the other. It seems to be just as sturdy as the one I had bought earlier. The only difference I noticed is that the bamboo finish isn't as smooth as the other one but really, it will not affect it use.. It holds 5 small/medium and 6 large knives and they are all held in place firmly in the slots without moving around when I open and close the drawer. This was definitely worth the purchase",
