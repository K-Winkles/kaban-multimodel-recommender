I've gone through many sets of knives over the years, knowing that I will eventually have to sharpen them with my wonderful motorized sharpening tool. Most edges rarely last a year, but these are really keeping their edge. It's been about a year, and these have outdone any other knives I own. Id say it has kept about 90% of it's sharpness. They look very cool in my kitchen as well. Also, hand wash them and dry them right away before putting them back, otherwise you will find tiny rust spots. It's a very fair price for the simple fact that they keep their edge, and look cool.",
