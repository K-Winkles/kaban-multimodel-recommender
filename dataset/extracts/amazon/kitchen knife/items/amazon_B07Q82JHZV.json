They are a beautiful dark blue color & are very sharp! I love the convenience of hanging them. I don\u2019t have room on my counter to set a block of knives & my old knives laid in a drawer & was always shuffling them around looking for the knife I needed. The magnet is strong but I am able to take off a knife with little effort. Even though these were bought on sale, I would happily buy them if they weren\u2019t.",

                "reviewText": "These knives are very nice! A solid set of knives for those who cook regularly. They do come with sleeves to protect the integrity of the knives, and your hands. They feel solid, decent in the hand. The handles aren\u2019t ergonomic in my opinion, but I don\u2019t feel like my hands will get extremely fatigued after cutting vegetables for those that have dexterity issues and is arthritic. Surprisingly sharp! They cut very well. The knives give a very smooth, clean cut with little effort. The color I purchased this knife set in is a rich navy blue metallic. Very shiny, reflective metallic color. I\u2019m not sure if the color is a paint coating. But upon cutting food, the color hasn\u2019t peeled off or transferred onto the food I\u2019ve cut. They\u2019re also dishwasher safe! They haven\u2019t dulled, bended or warped upon first, second, third & fourth wash. Thanksgiving 23\u2019 will really put these knives to the test. But so far they\u2019re 10 out of 10 for me. Highly recommend. Would say this set would make a very nice house warming gift.",
