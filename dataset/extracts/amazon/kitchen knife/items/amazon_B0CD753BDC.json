It just bites into anything you put underneath it -- it's *so* sharp... This one has a really nice weight to it, too, moreso than any of my other knives. As for aesthetics, it's very beautiful.. The wood handle is gorgeous and *perfectly* smooth. I don't know what kind of wood it is, but it has the same kind of iridescent glow in the woodgrain that you see in quarter sawn oak. And by a stroke of luck, the handle's shape is just perfect for the size of my hand. Being so pleased with the way this has held up and performed, I wouldn't hesitate to buy it as a gift for someone who likes to cook, as a 'special' seeming chef's knife. VERY nice...",
