                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Nice, High Quality Cleaver, no matter the price!",
                "reviewText": "I received this cleaver and was very impressed with the quality and durability. It is every bit as good as advertised. It is medium-large and adequately heavy with good heft in the hand. Like my daughter said upon picking it up, \"Wow. You could do some real damage with this!\" Yes, you can buy a few larger cleavers but I don't really think you will want to get anything larger, unless maybe you are in the business of commercial meat preparation.It is made of High Carbon stainless steel and the tang goes all the way through the handle. I know a few people have complained that they had trouble with the handle on theirs, but the handle is strong so far, with no sign of problems, and I don't expect any problem. The full tang is surrounded with a fitted molding of high impact ABS PVC plastic, for the grip. It is strong and durable, and I expect that it will be plenty long lasting, unless you drop it on hard concrete (not the best idea, anyway) or otherwise impact the ABS handle.This cleaver was very sharp, right out of the box. I routinely test my blades by using them to shave the hair on my arms. Some blades are never sharp enough. Some will shave, but require a lot of pressure. This cleaver just shaved my hair cleanly and smoothly. Very nice.I tested it on some very soft, ripe (but unbruised) avocados. It bisected them neatly, right through the seed and everything. Whack. Whack! Now, you would expect that a cleaver could cut through the soft flesh of the avocado. And you would expect that it would even, easily, cut through the avocado seed. But the impressive part was the cleanness of the cut. Right through both the hard seed and the soft flesh without bruising the flesh, squashing it, or pushing it aside by the seed as the blade passed through the seed. Very good.I could not feel good unless I give you a word of warning: PLEASE be CAREFUL with this cleaver. If you don't know how to use it, then learn how. My daughter, carelessly, let the cleaver drop an inch or two, onto the cutting board. Unfortunately, her finger was on the cutting board. The cleaver went right through her fingernail and cut some into her flesh, though it didn't penetrate farther because it was only dropped an inch or so. But, this cleaver WILL take off your finger if you are not careful. I mean it. No joke. You can use it to slice, just like a knife blade, with the proper precautions for your hands, but if you are using it as a cleaver, to whack stuff, then KEEP YOUR HANDS AWAY FROM THE CUTTING BOARD when chopping. And, if worst comes to worst and you DO cut off a finger (I am serious) then take your finger, put it in a bag with some ice, and drive immediately to the nearest emergency room. Because the cut will be so clean, and without extra tissue damage, there is a reasonable chance that they can be successful in re-attaching it.If you are looking for a cleaver, I recommend this one. A great value for the price.I should note that this cleaver is EXACTLY the same and the same model as what is sold by a different company here. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DKMY3K3I promise you that these are the same exact things, but sold under different names, possibly by different companies.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this after reading reviews. I am going to list the pros and cons. The knife is very sharp when its fresh out of the box, however if you chop too many bones it does lose its sharpness very soon. But, it can be sharpened easily and can be done multiple times because the knife is really heavy and has lot of metal in it. The handle is seamlessly built and merges into the blade beautifully. I use it for pretty much anything, cutting vegetables (I know right? but its got some weight to it so cutting vegetables is easy. Whatever it lacks in sharpness the weight compensates it because it helps in chopping). I use a trick to sharpen my blade everytime when I use it. I take ceramic coffee mug or a bowl and use its underside (the rough round edge) to sharpen it. Takes 10-20 slides on each side to make it sharp again. Use this technique guys ceramics are abbrasive can be used to sharpen steel blades anytime. Instead of buying blade sharpners use this trick. If you really really want an absolute soul cutter, I would suggest you buy a knife which is made from damascus steel. But if your budget is less and you want a good value for money cleaver, go for it.",

Makes easy work of this task and good, sharp edge already established on blade. Will likely need sharpening at regular intervals (as it will be chopping through bone), but large blade surface gives plenty of room for this. Good value for price.",

Great for raw/cooked meat, veggies, etc.(Note: I don't, and have never tried to, use it on bones, but I feel that it would definitely work for at least smaller bones, like chicken/fish/etc)I'm really glad I found this thing, it's a great weight, looks cool, and works very well. It's been super durable so far and I have no doubt that it'll last for years. Easily worth the price and then some, just a quality cleaver.",

I started making soup and wanted to have something to cut beets with and this works perfectly. Right now I'm using it to cut down the tops of carrots when they are too big for the intake of my juicer. It so nice to not have to worry about the knife not cutting properly. This cleaver is well balanced and I can see many years of perfect cuts ahead. It's also a great price so it is really a win-win situation here.",
