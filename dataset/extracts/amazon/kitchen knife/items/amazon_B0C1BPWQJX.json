After reading dozens of testimonials from previous customers, I decided on this set and I am so happy that I did! First, it was one of the few that offered two knives in a presentation box. Second, the cleaver is extremely heavy, not so much that it is ungainly to use, but heavy enuf to chop thru the thickest soup bone. And third they are incredibly sharp.If you\u2019re considering a knife set for the kitchen for your personal use or as a gift, this is the product to buy.",
