            "High-Carbon Stainless Steel Blade- It is manufactured from high-quality stainless steel that maintains its functionality for a long time. And to boost its sturdiness, the steel contains 0.6-0.75 carbon. This makes it two times as hard as other knives in its class as they contain about 0.3% carbon.",
            "Multi-functional Knife- The gyutou knife is classified and designed to be a multipurpose knife for professional applications. It cuts, dices, slices, chops and also cuts meat off bones. It comes with a HRC( Rockwell Hardness Scale) of 56-58 which makes it among the tough knives in its class.",
            "Ergonomic Pakka Handle- To make it more professional and minimize any fatigue, finger numbness or aches after holding it continuously for an extended time the knife's handle is made from Pakka. This is material that originates from Africa and its known for its comfort, strength and stability.",
            "Ultra-sharp Edge- Sharpness is key to achieving the best cuts and this is evident in the knife's blade which is quite sharp and will remain this way even after tough tasks such as cutting tough meat or removing flesh from bones. The sharpness is further boosted by use of the latest Japanese engineering.",
            "Corrosion Resistance Stainless Blade- In addition to carbon, 16-18% chrome is also included in the blade's metal composition. This gives its a glossy finish which will not tarnish even after using it for a long time, they are perfect mothers day gifts, christmas gifts, wedding and birthday gifts. We offer our customers a no-hassle refund within 3 months and a lifetime warranty on these knives."

                "reviewText": "Knives are sharp and cut excellently as well as holding and edge very well.That said, the finish on the handles started to fail after the first washing and are now just rough wood handles that had to be sanded smooth again and need to be worn in by use.Quality blade, cut corner wood handle. If you don't mind finishing the handle yourself, is an excellent chefs knife. Used daily in professional kitchen.",

                "reviewText": "I use the chef knife every day in my kitchen, and it's become a staple for a couple of simple reasons:It's crazy sharp, making chopping and slicing a whole lot easier. The handle is comfy, so even when I'm prepping a big meal, it feels good in my hand. And honestly, it just powers through everything I throw at it, from veggies to meats.If you're after a reliable knife for everyday cooking without all the fancy sales pitch, this one's a winner. It's just a darn good knife that gets the job done. Highly recommended!",

Das neue ist gut verarbeitet,hat ein ordentliches Gewicht, sauscharf und der Wellenschliff istprofessionell. Der Griff ist ergonomisch und angenehm, man k\u00f6nnteihn sogar mit 500er Schleifpapier noch leicht anrauen.Nachtrag am 07.11.2023Was ich heute getan habe, denn der Griff war doch sehr glatt .ich nahm 240er Papier (hatte grad nix anderes zur Hand) und schliffdamit QUER!! zum Griff ringsherum 2 Minuten die polierteOberfl\u00e4che leicht an. Ging einwandfrei. Danach den Griff kurtz sp\u00fclenund nun ist er richtig sch\u00f6n griffig und die Haptik ist noch angenehmer alsfr\u00fcher. Ich wei\u00df auch nicht, warum die Fernost-Hersteller immer alleslackieren oder polieren m\u00fcssen, das ist manchmal kontraproduktiv.Nachtrag EndeHabe heute schon mal einige Scheiben eines groben Roggenkastenbrotesgeschnitten und die Klinge verbiegt sich nicht und die Schnitte werdensauber und vor allem GRADE. Der Preis ist fast nicht zu glauben, daf\u00fcr,da\u00df dieses Messer aus Japan kommen soll und mit deutschem Kohlenstoff-stahl gefertigt sein soll. Na gut egal, ich denke mal es wird irgendwie doch inChina gefertigt worden sein, sonst l\u00e4\u00dft sich dieser Preis nicht \u00f6konomischdurchsetzen. Vielleicht ist es das \u00dcbliche also Design in Japan, Werkstoff Daber Herstellung \"Under Control\" der Japaner in China. Mir gef\u00e4llt diese kleinegeriffelte \"Samuraischwert\" und ich bin bis dahin sehr zufrieden.",
