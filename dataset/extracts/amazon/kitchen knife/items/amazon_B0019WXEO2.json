        "description": "A TRUSTED FAVORITEPreferred by both home chefs and culinary professionals, the 8\" Victorinox Fibrox Pro Breaking Knife is perfect for small and large butchering tasks. Crafted with a comfortable handle, superior weight and balance, and a razor sharp edge that rarely requires re-sharpening, this knife is an essential tool for every kitchen.KEY FEATURES High-quality, lightweight European steel. Handle design reduces hand and wrist fatigue. Fit for breaking down meat into smaller roasts and pieces. Wide, curved blade that helps keep meat together and uniform. Non-slip patented Fibrox Pro handle for a secure and comfortable grip no matter the hand size. National Sanitary Foundation (NSF) approved and dishwasher safe. CARE AND USEBe good to your knives and they\u2019ll be good to you. Following these simple guidelines will ensure that you get the longest life out of your knife! CLEANINGVictorinox Swiss Army recommends washing all knives by hand. For best results, hand wash your knives with a soapy cloth and dry immediately. While Fibrox Pro knives are dishwasher safe, we recommend hand washing as dishwashers are designed to spray water at a relatively high pressure, which can jostle the silverware and cause the knives to collide, dulling the edge.SHARPENINGFor optimum performance, knives should be honed after every couple of uses. Proper and frequent use of a honing steel will keep your knives sharper and performing at their best.FORMERLY FORSCHNERIn 1937 Victorinox began selling cutlery in America through a Connecticut distributor called R.H. Forschner & Co. A well-known manufacturer of butcher scales, Forschner soon became the exclusive U.S. distributor for Victorinox knives, and was the name by which Victorinox knives were known.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Probably one of the best, and most used kitchen knives you will ever use.The accompanying video I posted says it all, but here are some highlights to recap.Weight: it weighs 118 grams aka 4.16 ouncesBlade Length: the blade is just over 8 in Long on the cutting edge, and right at about 8 in on the upper edge aka the spine.Handle: I prefer this type of handle material, because it feels exactly like textured ABS plastic you would find in a brand new car. It feels solid, built very well, and has some grippy texture to it much like an orange peel does. There are micro pits, valleys and high parts on the handle which give me the confidence when holding this blade that it will stay in my hands and not slip.Sharpness: right out of the packaging, this blade feels like it will stay sharp for weeks if not months before having to re-sharpen. I use this blade probably once or twice a day, almost 7 days a week.Primary use. I think for most people they would grab this knife when trying to cut through a rib roast to make ribeye steaks, or when cutting up a turkey into sections. Like if I was going to cut up a whole chicken into quarters to cook faster in the oven, this would be the knife I would grab.I have seen some professional butchers buy three or four of these, and get them all Sharp at the beginning of the day. As each one begins to drag, and not perform as well, they'll simply move over to the next one, and then the next one after that. And the reason for that is so they don't have to sit there and resharpen the knife every single time. They can just sharpen all their knives all at once at the beginning of the day.Recap. It's a great knife, to me the perfect length for most kitchen cutting tasks. It's very sharp, seems to be made out of stainless steel, and feels like it's going to stay in my hand while using it. It does feel Nimble and light, very easy to maneuver.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a super sharp knife with a curved blade like this for trimming the fat from beef brisket before smoking it. Not only was this blade super sharp but the handle was easy to hold and has a nice non-slip surface for keeping your grip even if you get a little grease on your hand. The curve is especially important in this type of use as opposed to a straight blade so you are not getting the sharp tipped point caught up in the fat layers you're trying to cut off. IDK what is motivating some customers to criticize the lack of sharpness with this blade but that doesn't apply to the one I got. Once the brisket had 9.5 hours of smoking and 2 hours rest I used this same knife to slice it into prox 1/4\" wide strips to serve to my guests and it worked better and easier than 3 specialty meat knives that I used to use for this purpose! In subsequent days I even used it to easily and cleanly slice ripe homegrown tomatoes that are notorious for being tough to get through the skin. This went through like a chainsaw through butter! In reality, to use specifically to trim the fat on briskets this 8\" blade is about 2\" longer than would be ideal for that purpose but its such a high quality, super sharp steel blade that I look forward to adding it to our kitchen collection for lots of uses in the future. I'll probably go back and try to buy a 6\" version of this for the fat trimming as it will be a little more appropriately sized for that. I've not owned any cutting tools from this well known, Swiss brand but I'm a believer in their high quality, now!! I recommend this to any foodie who is serious about getting good results on the cutting board with your kitchen creations. Great knife!!",

Perfect size for boning out and breaking down meats, trimming briskets, etc. Wasn't too happy with how it was packaged. Just a thin plastic sleeve and wrapped in bubble wrap. I guess it was ok but taking just one star off for that. Otherwise all 5 stars.",

Compro mucha carne en pieza completa y la corto yo mismo, esto lo hac\u00eda con un cuchillo de chef muy bueno, pero al ser completamente r\u00edgido me costaba trabajo no llevarme m\u00e1s carne que grasa o pellejos.
