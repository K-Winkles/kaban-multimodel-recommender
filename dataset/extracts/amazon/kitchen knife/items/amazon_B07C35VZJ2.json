                "reviewText": "6-month (4/4/2021) update: I use this knife every day and still haven't sharpened it yet. It still cuts through everything fairly easily. Tomato sometimes needs a poke first, so it's close to needing a pass or two through the sharpener, but come on! Six months of staying sharp? How cool is that? I hand-wash and immediately dry & put back in the plastic sheath it came with, making sure to slide the tip into the little extra bit of plastic. If I had a knife block of some sort then I wouldn't bother, but I'm a little limited on space so it lives in a drawer with it's less-than-awesomely sharp brethren. I still haven't cut myself because you gotta respect this blade. Five stars well earned, Cutluxe!(11/19/2020) This Cutluxe 8\" Chef Knife is a serious pro-grade knife. Before I go there, there's no mention of a sheath - so I included a picture of the plastic blade and tip covers that comes with it. I've been very careful with it and 3 months later it's still protecting the knife. It's not meant for long-term protection, but for me it's nice to know that I won't slice my hand reaching for the knife, and the blade won't get scratched up in the drawer. I'll get a better solution soon - a magnetic knife holder or a real sheath - but for now, this works. On to the knife! It will cut pretty much anything. I've never hacked apart frozen green beans before, but this knife cut them clean with no damage to the blade or edge. I have cut apart a rotisserie chicken, but I've never had a knife slice right through the middle, bones and all. Like I bought a spineless chicken! Anything else I've cut using it daily has been great: tomato slices paper-thin or however thick you want. Same for onion. Minced garlic? No problem. Broad blade makes the initial smash easy. At this point I wouldn't be afraid to hack down a tree with it, use it to strip the branches and peel the bark, and carve that tree into a sheath. Hmm, there's an idea... Top grade steel and a full tang for durability. Handle is big, so you want to use the pinch grip at the bolster which is the default for chef's knives anyways. Bolster is contoured beautifully and the balance feels good. Handle is solid. Have I mentioned that I haven't sharpened it ever? It's still just as sharp as the day I got it months ago. All I do to take care of it is hand-wash the blade right away, rinse, and allow to dry before putting it away. Daily use, multiple times a day people. Paper-thin tomato without any ragged edge. Every day. This should have been the Forged in Fire official knife.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The best part about Cutluxe knives is the excellent quality steel and my favorite feature is the unique, incredibly comfortable, angled bolster. This knife places itself in your hand in the correct position and after an hour of chopping it won\u2019t cut into your hand. This knife is one of the best quality, most comfortable chefs knives I\u2019ve used and I own many much more expensive knives. I\u2019ve had this for about two months or longer and I use it several times daily and it holds an edge very well, just a few swipes on my ceramic hone (by Mercer) and it\u2019s good as new. It\u2019s a full tang blade, three rivet construction, heavy, squared shape handle. It has a perfect curve for chopping and pivoting. Fits well in a large hand but not too big for an average hand, it\u2019s well balanced and did I mention the angled bolster, so awesome!Now, as I mentioned in my video, there were some finish issues on the handle in the beginning. The metal protruded from the handle on the tang and was quite sharp. I had no issues getting it replaced immediately and the replacement was better. The newest cleaver they just came out with was fine so hopefully Cutluxe has fixed that issue and it seems they have. I love this chefs knife, if you didn\u2019t know what it cost, you would assume this was a couple hundred dollars when you hold it in your hand. It\u2019s amazing you can get a knife this awesome for the unbelievable low price. I own the set, I\u2019m honestly not as in love with all of the set, I don\u2019t like the bread knife, it won\u2019t cut hard bread or the big clumsy paring knife but I can tell you the chefs knife, the cleaver and the boning knife are the big standouts in the Cutluxe lineup. I highly recommend this chef knife as well as the boning and cleaver knife, they are fantastic!",

                "reviewText": "I'm currently working as a cook, and I have used this knife for the last few days.When it arrives, it is very sharp.The overall design of the knife is gorgeous. It's weighted right at the hilt, as a chefs knife should be.It's quite light for such a large knife, and is comfortable to use for many hours on end.The German steel used in the knife is a High-Carbon Stainless Steel, which is good for both keeping a sharp edge and rust resistance.If your budget is around 40 bucks, this knife will only cost half of that, and will absolutely fill all of your requirements.*UPDATE*At this point I've used this knife daily for the last week or two. It still performs wonderfully. After about two days of very heavy use, it does lose a good bit of it's edge, but It's only noticable because I like my knives to be razor sharp. But a few strokes with an accusharp or honing rod will sharpen it right back up.*UPDATE 2*I moved to a new job, still as a cook, and brought this knife with me. I didn't get to use it for weeks because my coworkers all love it so much!! So I bought another one :)*UPDATE 3*At this point I still believe this knife is a good deal (although it has doubled in price since I first purchased it). All 3 of these that I've bought over the last few years are still in good condition, except one that got it's tip bent because of a reckless coworker. Would definitely still recommend this knife at $40 but there's better you can get for $50-60. Happy Cooking!",
