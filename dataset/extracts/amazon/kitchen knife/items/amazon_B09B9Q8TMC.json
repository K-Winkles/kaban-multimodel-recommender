                "reviewText": "The Knives and butcher block are very nice. Quality stainless steel set that looks wonderful on my granite countertop.But, Three of the steak knives had a minor factory defect a half inch from the tip on the top and the chef knife had a 3\u201d scratch on the left side. Upon opening the knife set I cleaned and dried all knives very carefully with a soft sponge and a soft new towel. These defects were from the factory, there is no warranty information in the packaging or on the Amazon website. Just an email which I\u2019m getting no response from. My rating could potentially change depending if the company reaches out.Edit: adding 1 star to review as the company did reach out the next day. They asked for pictures which I provided and I just now got a response for a resolution. They offered to either replace the four knives with the minor defects or a partial refund which is what I accepted. They stated the defects possibly happened during shipping but that seems impossible because they actually were packaged very well.Once I actually get the partial refund I\u2019ll add 1 more star. I did ask one more time what the actual warranty is because they did not answer that question initially, simply \u201cnot to worry and they would help me out however they could\u201d.The Amazon link for the warranty tells you to contact the company, like I said earlier there is nothing referencing warranty in the box.Edit: I just got another email from them stating they \u201cgenerally provide a lifetime warranty\u201d So that\u2019s good to knowI actually used the steak knives yesterday for dinner and they cut well, I\u2019m still getting used to the serrated aspect since my old set was non-serrated.Edit: I did receive the partial refund a couple days later as promised and the company made good to my satisfaction. I am adding one more star to my review as promised. The knife set continues to impress. I cut onions the other day and the chef knife went through them like butter.Yes, I very well could\u2019ve returned them through Amazon and requested a new set initially but I wanted to see how the company would respond and they did so very well and promptly. I would buy this knife set again in the future and do recommend them.",

While I don't use it daily, it sees weekly use, and even after a year, the knives remain in exceptional condition\u2014no rust or signs of wear. The wooden box has maintained its original quality since the day of purchase. These knives are not only heavy and durable but also draw compliments from anyone who sees them in my kitchen. Overall, it has been a highly satisfying investment.",

Now these are not super expensive or super in expensive. I wanted what I could afford and looked for good reviews. The reviews were spot on. Yes they come razor sharp. Easy to wash, well packaged. Each knife is individually wrapped and protected. The block it comes with was far better than any knife block I have had in the past. It actually is balanced. Great purchase and very happy.",
