So, I ordered three. They fit well in a drawer next to each other and they held all of our knives. The only thing is if you have a knife that doesn't have a very thin handle you might not be able to place one knife per slot. I had to skip a couple of slots with some of my knives but I ordered enough that I still managed to fit all of them in the drawer. Really well priced and easy to use",

                "reviewText": "My expectations were low as I awaited the arrival of this in-drawer knife block, since a few reviewers described it as flimsy and disappointing. It is a chunk of indestructible, weaponized oak? Absolutely not. But if the point is to remove the giant chunk of tree from a countertop to create usable space, this horizontal knife block is perfect. It's hollow plastic, so it doesn't add much weight to a utensil drawer. The slots are spaced to accommodate everything from tiny paring blades to giant, serrated bread knives. Small-handled knives can go in consecutive slots on the top row, while ones with substantial handles can be neatly stored on the bottom tier with a free slot or two between them. Prior to purchasing this, I laid all my knives flat on a silicone mat in the drawer, which was fine until I realized what a waste of valuable storage space that was. Will this knife block survive a nuclear holocaust? No. But it's far from flimsy! It's exactly the density it needs to be to do its very specific job. It stays in place nicely when I open and close the drawer and it freed up eight inches of drawer width and all but eliminated the risk of injury from reaching into a drawer full of loose knives. Call me impressed!",

Unfortunately, I didn't gain much in space and it doesn't look as nice as the bamboo knife organizer that I was using previously.The deception comes from the fact that the spaces that hold the knives are very close together. So a knife with a thick handle cannot be placed immediately next to another knife with a thick of medium handle. There isn't enough room between the slots and therefore, you end up losing space because you have to set knives farther apart.I am not pleased with the product and I failed to gain the additional space I needed.",
