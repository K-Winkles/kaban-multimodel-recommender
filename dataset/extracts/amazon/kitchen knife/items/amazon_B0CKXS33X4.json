With its smooth transition from forward to back the roller glides down the blade with vengeance as it sharpens the great warriors mighty blade. Then with a quick flip the roller becomes the ultimate finishing touch to give the blade its devastating razor edge. But don\u2019t forget the double sided magnetic block holder. It has a magnetic hold powerful enough for the mighty power of the kings decision stick. Know this, this sharpener kit is fit for a king and his rain of power to all who oppose him.It is also a great value as it would allow the king to give thanks to the gods with a golden sacrifice and still have enough bullion left over to build as many Viking ships as possible to sail across the treacherous seas and over run his enemies.",
