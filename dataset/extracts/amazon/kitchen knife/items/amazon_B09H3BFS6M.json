                "reviewText": "The knives are exactly as advertised, the blades are of good quality, look good and are sharp enough for 95% of cooks out there. I like that it has an embedded sharpener. I paid about $90 on Cyber Monday for these knives and I\u2019m really happy with them. But be aware that, for the original price of $220, I think you can find better options like Henckles or Cusinart.Pros: good price and good quality for a day-to-day set of knives for your kitchen. $80 is what I usually spend on a single knife that I use for cooking on special occasions, so this set is a great price and good enough quality for the daily grind;Cons: maybe some people don\u2019t care about this and, considering the $90 price for the whole set, I shouldn\u2019t either. But the material of the handle shows inconsistent shades throughout the set, with one of the knives (slicing knife) showing a clear defect on the surface finish (my photo shows some light-colored veins on its wood handle). If you\u2019re going to pay over $200 for a set, I would expect it to have a beautiful and consistent surface finish on all of the pieces. Again, it\u2019s not a build quality issue, it\u2019s a cosmetic flaw.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these knives as a present for my Father-in-law. I was hoping to find another young knife company with high quality products before everyone realized just how great they are and their prices reflect that quality, just like I did when I bought all my Dalstrong knives years ago. Well, I chose well. These are quality knives. The steel takes and holds an edge and does not corrode. The tang does in fact go all the way through the handles. The finish is beautiful and is resilient to washing. AND, I am a little jealous that these knives are better (perfectly) balanced than my old Dalstrong Gladiators. Six months in, he is happy, so my wife is happy, so I am happy.",

                "reviewText": "The knife set is awesome and customer service is excellent!The knives are very well made. the weight is great, and they are very well balanced. They feel good in the hand and make using extremely comfortable. The handles are made of wood and the blades are sharp- very sharp.We did have an issue with one knife in which the handle started to split but I reached out to Brodark customer service and received a response right away. They sent a replacement set even though I needed just one knife replaced. AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I believe the one knife handle issue is not typical because we have not had any other issues with the entire set and we use these every day.As with all quality knives, handwash only. We handwash them and dry them right away and they continue to be in perfect condition.As for sharpness and just to compare, we had a set of Henckel knives and after a month of use we were constantly having to sharpen them. The Henckels had rust starting to appear after a year of use, even with handwashing and drying so we were looking to replace them. I found these and decided to give them a go and so far they have not had to be sharpened, no rust has appeared, and they remain in new condition even after heavy use. I appreciate Broadark standing behind their knives and craftsmanship and I certainly recommend these knives.",
