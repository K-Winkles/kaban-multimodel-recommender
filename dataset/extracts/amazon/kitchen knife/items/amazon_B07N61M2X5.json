The tangs and the blades are much thinner than their more expensive lines, maybe by half. The blades are very flexible and it\u2019s a noticeable difference from the more expensive stuff. If you just want a decent knife that you can sharpen and look good, this is fine. If you\u2019re looking for sturdier, more substantial knives, spend the money to get something better.",

They are well-balanced, sharp and such a pleasure to use. I make lots of dishes requiring chopping, dicing, and mincing and I get meals prepared quickly with these knives. This starter set has the essential knives you need. The serrated knife cuts bread better than any bread knife I have used. I consider these an excellent buy.",
