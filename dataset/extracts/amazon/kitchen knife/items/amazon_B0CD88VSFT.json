They come sharp, have protectors so you don't accidentally slice yourself if they're in a drawer, are bright pink and the tang/shank goes all the way down the handle, which makes a nice knife. The handles are plastic and fairly comfortable in the hand but I have other knives that are way more comfortable and a few that are not. I got these because they are pink. My husband and my son have a tendency to use my knives and they won't touch these because they're hot pink (the same reason I always buy hot pink lighters, no one steals them). These would be good for someone going into a first apartment, for a furnished rental (VRBO or Airbnb). I can't speak to how long they stay sharp but so far I've been cutting stuff like chicken, beef and veggies with no issues.",

And they are a fun color, which my daughters have loved when they get to help me in the kitchen. I would recommend these knives, especially for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I love how easily these knives just slice straight through my tomatoes without leaving a seedy wet mess behind. My old knife must've been more dull than I realized as these knives slice and dice without any indent or pressure and that's a huge help when it comes to prepping meals and when eating those meals. I did cut myself the first time using due to using this knife like I was used to with the dull knife- too much force not enough paying attention. If I skipped with the old knife no big deal. This knife however is so sharp that it was a big deal when I cut myself . I don't like the handle as it's hard to get a steady good strong grip and when I'm cooking my hands get greasy or wet and it's hard to not have them slipping down the handle. So that's the one and only con I experienced. I like the protective covering as that's a big safety feature that makes it convenient to put in and take out of the silverware drawer without cutting your hand.",
