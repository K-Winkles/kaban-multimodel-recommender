                "reviewText": "This is a pretty good knife set, especially for fifty bucks. The knives were all very sharp and there is a good selection of them. The block is very nice--it is solid feeling, stores all the knives, and has a built in sharpener. I am not very impressed with the cheese and pizza knives--they don't cut very well and I think the seller would be better off just providing two more utility or paring knives. The knife handles also do not feel very solid and I am afraid that they are the things that are inevitably going to break or fail on these knives. However, you can probably get a couple of years of regular use out of this set before it falls apart which is pretty good for the low price. If you want something of higher quality that is going to last longer, you are going to have to pay two or three more times the cost of this set.",

The black of the block and the black of the knives themselves looks very sleek.The knives are already very sharp, but the block does come with a built-in knife sharpener for convenience.The cheese cutter and pizza cutter are my favorite knives in the whole block and I am very happy with this purchase.",
