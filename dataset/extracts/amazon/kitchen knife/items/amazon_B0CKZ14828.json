This was easy to assemble, the suction cups works well on our quartz counter. The magnet holds the knives in place and are the knives easy to remove when you nees to use them. It goes well with our modern kitchen decor. Not sure how much it stands up to use over time but at the price point, I highly recommend it.",

So far it works as intended to keep the knife set handy yet out of the way. I got this mainly because my knife block held the knives in such a way that I could not keep it entirely under my upper cabinets - the handles were too high.But this works under those cabinets. Its fit and finish are nice, although you'll see some bit of a gap in the photo. All things considered I would recommend this knife block. It also makes it easier to grab the correct knife - the type that have the knife blades hidden can result in pulling several knives before getting the one you need. With this one all of the blades are visible. So you grab the correct knife every time.",

                "reviewText": "I have a few knife blocks, but I find they are awkward and slow. It's so much easier to grab my knives off a magnetic bar or in this case a magnetic knife block. I use both in my kitchen, with my most commonly used knives on the bar, and the rest on this block.Mine was ready to go out of the box. I prefer this all metal style to the wood ones. It's easier to clean and there's no moisture absorption. Make sure though that that your knives are completely dry when putting them on the block, and obviously avoid hitting the edge/tip.",
