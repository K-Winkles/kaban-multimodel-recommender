                "reviewText": "This is one of those items that looks far better in person than in the photos. It arrived fairly sharp (I'll work on the edge some myself). It's got some good heft to it and just looks really nice. In use it seemed reasonably balanced and is surprisingly good as a general purpose knife. It is certainly good for boning. I don't know that I'd try cutting a larger bone with it, but I didn't get it for that. The sheath isn't the best, but will serve as a blade guard at least until I get the magnetic knife rail put in.",
