                "reviewText": "Knife Set BETTER THAN EXPECTED! I am Disabled and need easy access to everything including silverware and cooking knives. I hate going through drawers to find either. So I have a hanging silverware Set(4 place) on a small rack on my kitchen counter and needed a knife set. This set is Not Only Beautiful but the acrylic holder displays them compactly narrow, handy, and Beautifully on the counter as well. The knives are well made.I got these BLUE ONES because I have friends that come over and cook and barbecue with me and sometimes (when they clean up) and take some left over food for their kids home the large bowls sometimes have my small knives in them. They bring them back but I figure the BLUE ONES will stand out so they can find them easier than the normal Stainless Steel ones and I'll get them back sooner. They don't take the knives on purpose but you know how it is when you are trying to cleanup fast with a bunch of children around and your concentration is broken that some utensils in the bowls can get packed up by mistake to. The mother is all apologies when she realizes what has happened when she gets home and I laugh because I know her & her family and know it is just an oversight on her part as a mother. It's fun to see but frustrating when I need one of the knives and I don't have it. So... NOW! THESE BLUE ONES WILL REALLY STAND OUT and solve (the Problem?) LOL And... THEY ARE WELL MADE, COMFORTABLE TO HOLD, AND BEAUTIFUL to see. I think you will REALLY LIKE THEM.",

                "reviewText": "I like these knives quite a bit. I've done my kitchen in blue, and these fit right in. They look good on the counter, not some generic ugly wooden block. Also, because of the openness of the stand design, I can let the knives air dry right in their stand without worrying about wood getting moldy or nasty. You can easily clean inside the stand.The knives themselves are very sharp. No issues with the color coating. I like that there's a sharpener, vegetable peeler, and scissors with it. Haven't had a chance to use the sharpener or the vegetable peeler yet. They're fairly comfortable to hold, and I like them very much. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they're definitely not full tang, and have this textured plastic handle, so I'm worried how long they will last. I may come back and raise or lower the rating depending on their longevity. I'm happy with my purchase though.***Update***So I\u2019ve had these knives a while and I\u2019m definitely not as impressed. I mentioned them not being full tang and sure enough one has come apart. The others are still together and work fine. They have also discolored though. All of them. And very shortly after receiving them. They just very quickly get off-colored spots and brown spots.Also, the tip on the chefs knife bent the very first time I used it. I did not stab into anything. I didn\u2019t like stab it into the cutting board or anything. Just one minute it\u2019s straight, next it\u2019s bent. I literally have no idea how it could have happened. I have since used pliers to straighten it out and it\u2019s working fine again.I still love the stand. The scissors and the vegetable peeler are fantastic. Knife sharpener is super handy. If you really like the look of the knives, they\u2019re not a terrible purchase for the price point. But I wouldn\u2019t buy these again.",
