I love an \"old fashion\" wooden handle with through rivets. I never use the dishwasher for my knives and dry them right away after hand washing. The price was the second + for this purchase. I was extremely surprised how good they look, how well finished they are, and how beefy & sharp they were. I did a light honing on them and off to work they went. I think it is a great value.",
