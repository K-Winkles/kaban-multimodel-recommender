                "reviewText": "We have been using this knife since Christmas, and we are so happy with it. We bought a small Cangshan set for my MIL, and honestly this knife feels and cuts just as well as their more expensive Chef knife. The quality feels amazing, the handle feels so solid (and it\u2019s gorgeous), and it cuts so much cleaner and easier than the basic knifes we got as a wedding gift many years ago. No, this isn\u2019t meant to compete with those Damascus style German carbon steel $$$ knives, but it\u2019s an amazing value for the price. If you need a good quality chef knife for under $30, this is absolutely the knife for you. The quality is just excellent. It definitely surprised my husband and I! We love it.Also- it does not come with a protective sheath, so we bought a bamboo drawer knife \u201cblock\u201d to store it in with our other knives. We store our knives in a drawer instead of a counter knife block.",

                "reviewText": "I don't know anything about knives, other than what a Cutco salesperson told me (to sell me their knives). The cutcos were great, but I lost them in a divorce, and somehow wound up with the cheapest worst knives imaginable. I mean they will cut steak if you really work at it, but they just do not work for chopping vegetables or anything. I finally decided I needed something to chop veggies and just be an all around versatile knife to have in the kitchen. I'm not a chef and I only begrudgingly cook, so I didn't want to spend a fortune.I got this one because of the other positive reviews and I have to say they were right. I actually have to be really careful with this knife because it is so sharp. I won't even let my kids touch it (they are in middle school) when they are cooking because I'm that scared of how sharp it is lol. Respect this knife. It is really big too. I've been able to chop everything up with ease and am very happy with this purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I recently bought this and a Mosfiata knife with similar features and of the same length, just to try them both out.The blade is very sharp, indexes well, and the longer handle makes it pretty maneuverable. I'll have to try quartering chicken with it before I pass final judgement but thus far it does well cutting steaks and filleting (Though I also managed to fillet my finger a little bit)My only real complaint is that the finger guard is a little small for my large fingers and the handle shape is a bit awkward. I have fairly large hands so it's a little on the thin side for me, with the only thickening being at the very back of the handle. This makes it difficult for me to hold, but can generally be solved by choking up on the knife a bit more or gripping the back of the blade. If you have large hands like me it'll be fine for short prep but may grow uncomfortable over long periods. Great for dinner for 2-4, less so for family holiday prep",

I haven't owned any better ones to compare it to, but it seems to be much higher quality than the dollar store knives I'm used to using. It's substantial and weighty but not too heavy, the handle feels nice, and the blade seems super sharp. I cut some zucchini with it and, well... it cut it.The length of it is a bit longer than I'm used to, so I'm not super comfortable getting a fancy with my knife skills yet, but hopefully I'll adjust.The finger guard, is a nice touch, though I'm not sure if I'm ever going to use it. I'll just try not to cut my fingers.",
