It\u2019s light and fits well in my wife\u2019s hand. This is important for an older person or someone with arthritis. The quality of the blade seems good and for the price I\u2019d highly recommend this knife. Even if I have to replace it in a year it would probably be worth it compared to having to sharpen a more costly knife. I\u2019m actually going to buy another as the price is almost inconsequential.Edit. I\u2019ve bought another one and plan on a third. I have no idea how long this blade will retain its edge but whether cutting onions or frozen sausage this knife makes it easy.",

I mean, I wouldn't try to crack open a watermelon with them. Although they'd probably handle it, it seems like that kind of thing would wear them out pretty quickly.Overall they're great for tomatoes, peppers, radishes, etc. All the smaller stuff.
