                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars A skeptically honest review",
                "reviewText": "I will admit, I saw a tremendous amount of negative feedback about this particular blade. From quick dulling, to shoddy workmanship resulting in poor fit and finish, amongst various other things. But, I liked the geometry, of the handle and the size of the blade rather than a larger butcher knife, and as a knife Aficionado with years of making knives as well as sharpening them for about everyone I know, I thought why not give it a chance. If it's not all that, I'm not out much.I was pleasantly surprised.First off the ads are very misleading, this is not hand hammered or forged obviously. It is stamped cut steel, but it is what it is. However, right out of the box, which is actually quite nice, it was actually quite sharp near the front portion of the blade about halfway down. While it did not have the shown and discussed jimping as was in the ad, I was glad that it did not because I personally do not like jimping. It's a fairly hefty piece of steel but not overly weighty, and upon putting it back in the sheath actually cut myself. Not being an amateur, these are just things that happen and that was no one's fault but my own obviously. But at least it was sharp enough to do so.Upon measuring the edge geometry, it appeared to be more of a 30\u00b0 than the traditional 25\u00b0 that I like, but I re-honed the rest of the blade to all be 30\u00b0 so it would be uniform. Having done so, I think this might be advantageous insofar as it retained its edge quite well.First things first, make CERTAIN to give it a proper washing. It is covered in grease, which is a very good thing, and the blackening process of the faux forge needs some cleaning as well. Which of course I did again after sharpening at 30\u00b0.During processing of food, I sliced thick breakfast sausage which as we know if the knife is not sharp, will often just mash through instead of properly slicing. It did very well. From there I went to slicing potatoes and dicing them for frying, after which I sliced and diced mushrooms. Throughout the process it never lost its edge.I wear large size gloves, and the handle did not feel too small, and actually was quite comfortable and smooth. The chopping and rocking motion of the blade allowed for a multitude of different types of food processing, and no hot spots.After utilizing the blade in its entirety, it still maintained its edge which I can probably attribute to the 30\u00b0 angle which in this case is good for something that's also going to chop. At the end of the day, I was quite impressed which I did not expect. Not only would I buy this item again, I would recommend it to friends as it is quickly becoming my favorite kitchen knife, and is very handy in a multitude of different handling positions. While the sheath is slightly thin, it functions well, and carries nicely on the hip. And, should one decide to use this in the woods, which I will try some time when hunting, the spine is quite shard, and actually sharp enough to strike a fero rod without having to re-grind to do so. So overall, I am quite impressed with this blade.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this knife because we wanted a 'clever' style blade for cutting meat, but did not want to spend a lot of a 9\" dedicated clever. I figured this might serve the clever needs and still be useful for other cutting jobs. I'm thrilled with this blade. The thick metal stock means there's good weight to it and lots of metal to last through years of sharpening. The blade was sharp out of the box but REALLY takes an edge well if you sharpen it properly. The handle and balance are good. The placement of the finger hole isn't really useful. I would actually like a hole at the opposite end from the handle so you could secure the far end of the blade for dicing. The curved blade makes rocking the blade for dicing veggies etc a breeze. Great price, recommended. One drawback is that it does not fit any standard knife blocks. If you use the included leather sleeve or a magnetic wall mount that won't matter.",

It's sharp, sturdy, looks and feels great in the hand, smooth cut. Haven't even had to sharpen it yet and have already been through 2 cows and 4 deer. Fantastic knife.",

Would highly recommend for all of your kitchen needs!!",

When I say sharp, I mean like bumping it and it giving a good little bleeder. I will say I left it laying on the counter for a day or two out of its sleeve and it looked dull in color like it needed some mineral rubbed on the metal. Aside from that I have no complaints so far. I have cut meat and veggies with it and had no issues. It cuts like a knife through soft butter on everything so far.",
