Seems to be holding its edge well.A replacement for my pride Chicago Cutlery paring knife, which finally gave up the ghost, and has a cracked plastic handle. This was the closest substitute without paying a fortune. Very nice price, handy, and had no issues since arrival. Edge was burr free, and felt very smooth. Test cut with a carrot was good -cut without issue, managed doing mid-stroke direction change without issue. Even the peelings were damp and clean.Very good knife - prob will buy another when the other CC knife meets its fate as its brother.",
