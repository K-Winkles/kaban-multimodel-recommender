                "reviewText": "I bought it as a present for my husband for his home office and he likes it a lot! It looks great, very impressive. The features are great, the massage is not to strong but great for an office chair, the foot rest is very comfortable, it reclines back nicely almost like laying down. We definitely recommend this chair.",

                "reviewText": "First thing I noticed when I unboxed it was thatheavy smell of manufactured plastic. Kind of like a shower curtian. Assembly was pretty easy I'll give it that. Chair is firm enough but not too soft. Foot rest feels flimsy. Arms wobble and there is a little bit of a rocking motion in the seat and back. I doubt this will last very long. Massage feature is more of a vibration than anything else. Not very powerful. Priced as it is I should have expected this. Keep looking, this isn't the one.",

You can\u2019t even notice the heat. The massage vibrators you can barely feel but definitely not enough to even feel good. They should just take them add ons out of the chair and drop the price",

                "reviewText": "This chair was very easy to put together and has several different vibration modes and speeds. The heat on my chair was not working so I reached out to return it, but you have to have original packaging in order to send it back. I reached out to the seller directly and they called me and made it right. I highly recommend this company. Even though my chair wasn't working properly the seller was VERY quick to get back with me to make it right. If what they promised isn't fulfilled I will edit and update this review. The only negative besides my heat not working is it doesn't tilt back at all. It's either recline or lock straight up with hurts my tailbone so guess I'll have to buy a tailbone pillow. Other than that I like the chair.",
