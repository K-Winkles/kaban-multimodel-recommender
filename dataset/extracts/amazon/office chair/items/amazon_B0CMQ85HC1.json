                "reviewText": "I have to admit, I was a little bit skeptical to buying this chair. It's not a known brand, and the product info and photos was kinda limited. But, I couldn't find any other chair that matched what I was looking for \u2014 a wide seat so that I can sit cross legged while I work all day long.Since Amazon in Europe didn't have the same chair, I ordered it from the US. Shipping was extremely fast, in less than a week it had traveled from California to Spain, passed customs and was delivered to my doorstep. Assembling the chair took 15 minutes max.The chair itself looks way better in real life than in the photos. It has some orange/grey threads in the fabric, which means it isn't white-white (good for me, because I didn't want a white chair). It's really comfy, and it's definitively wide enough to sit cross legged and in any other position with my legs up. I also love that you can adjust the amount of tilt on the chair.I'm really happy with the chair, and can definitively recommend it to anyone else who can't sit straight in a normal chair for more than 5 minutes.",

However, a few issues with structural quality:1. some miscuts on the metal made it difficult to assemble as some screw holes were covered up.2. after a few months of use one one of the screws holding the back to the base broke in half. The chair collapsed as a result, causing me to fall out -- luckily uninjured.Edit: customer service was very helpful and reached out to replace all broken parts. Adjusted rating accordingly.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m going to keep this because it is cute and I took the time to put it together and taking it apart to return it would be a lot of work. That being said, there are two issues:1) it is a dark beige weave and part of the weave is straight up yellow. It photographs very light but is almost tan in person2) the seat is wide enough to sit cross legged but not as deep as I was expecting. This is good because I won\u2019t be very far from my computer when typing but I\u2019m definitely sitting up very straight to accommodate the lack of depth so I won\u2019t be relaxing much in the chair like I imagined.Over all, it\u2019s pretty, wasn\u2019t too hard to assemble, and has good cushion. I paid $210 for it (with wheels) and would be very happy with it at about half of that price. At $210 I\u2019m just a little underwhelmed.Tip: when assembling, it goes together easier if you use the weight of the bottom chair to push it down on the back of the chair, so I assembled with the back of the chair flag on the table and the seat of the chair perpendicular to it. This helped the holes align easier. Otherwise it might have taken another set of hands to hold them together while I screwed it in.",

                "reviewText": "I've only ever written 1 or 2 reviews on Amazon, but I really like this chair and thought I should do one on it.I received the chair promptly, and it looked pretty close to what the photos show. I've seen some other reviews that complained about it having too many orange threads or whatever, but I didn't find that to be a problem. To be fair, there are orange threads in the upholstery fabric, as well as charcoal gray and \"neutral\" tan ones. From a bit of a distance it looks like the photos in the listing. From up close, you can see the individual threads, but it doesn't look any different than I expected. I'm perfectly happy on that front.Comfort-wise, I love it. The foam on the seat and backrest is comfy and supportive. And the chair is _wide_ and gently curved. I love it. I'm 6'2\" and 245 pounds, not a small guy, but not obese or anything. Although, if that's how you roll, this would be an excellent chair for you. But I do like to sit in various positions, cross-legged, normal feet-on-ground, half-crossed switching from side-to-side (I hope that makes sense). This chair allows that, with no weird parts or sections digging into your. I've had plenty of chairs over the years that were built for 180 pound butts sitting with both feet on the ground, and if you differed from that, you paid a price. Not with this chair.And I guess finally, assembly was easy. Took about 15 minutes. The most confusing part was siguring out how to attach the \"control module\" (the part that raises/lowers the chair and adjusts tilt) to the seat. When you're looking at the bottom of the seat, the front edge of the seat is farthest away from the various bolt holes. On the control module, there is a not-very-noticeable arrow that should point to the front edge of the seat.And the instructions emphasize only screwing in the bolts loosely at first. That is the truth. If you screw the first one or two in too tight to start off with, you won't be able to get the last two in correctly. They'll be trying to go in at an angle, which won't work. Back all bolts out to just finger tightness, get them all in place like that, then go back and tighten them down completely.So yeah, great chair so far. Today was my first day of actually sitting in it. So we'll see how it holds up over the coming months/years. I'll update if anything notable changes, but so far I'm very happy.",
