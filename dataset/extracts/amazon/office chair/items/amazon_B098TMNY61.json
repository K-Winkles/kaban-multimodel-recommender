                "reviewText": "I ordered this office chair as I needed a new one and decided to go with the white/gold to match my desk. Although the gold on the chair and my desk are two different finishes of gold, it has a bit of a chic-like look and feel to it.I know many of the reviews say this chair is very easy to assemble but it\u2019s more like semi-easy-ish. While understanding the parts and having the knowledge of assembling the chair, it\u2019s not as easy to assemble if you\u2019re doing it by yourself. Many of the screw placement holes don\u2019t fully align correctly so you have to use force to manually align your parts to each hole in order to successfully drill all of your screws in tightly. Assembly time is much slower when using a manual Allen wrench so I suggest using a powered one instead as it\u2019s more efficient.It\u2019s a comfortable chair and I personally like the straight back support it gives me. I have read reviews that the chair will decline in quality after heavy use but unless you are jumping on this thing, I don\u2019t think the wear and tear will happen. I can\u2019t say the same for the faux leather element because we just never know.Overall, it\u2019s not a bad chair for the price. I would recommend it for yourself.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to love this chair... but I just can't. I do feel like the quality is probably in line with the price (I still feel like this is probably overpriced for the quality and it is more of a $100 chair); however, I still can't get beyond a few things. First, the chair is a beautiful white color, but the fabric feels and looks extremely cheap. Out of the box, the fabric already seems to be \"stretched\" in a few places, and I predict it will begin to show wear very quickly. There were also several small tears in the fabric immediately out of the box. Secondly, while the chair has a wonderfully comfortable cushion, the back feels too \"upright\", and the chair doesn't lean back easily or with any \"flow\" to it. Also, as others have noted, the casters are terrible and do not roll. When trying to roll the chair, half of the casters don't even turn in the correct direction and instead skid across the floor. Lastly, the assembly was made more difficult due to the screw holes not lining up properly forcing the screws to need to be put in at an angle. At the end of the day, repackaging and sending back would be more trouble than I am looking to go through. This is meant to be a temporary chair, so it will certainly get the job done for now. However, if I could do it over again, I would have selected a different chair.",

It's not super plush...it sits me completely upright and seems as if it will support proper posture. There is no lumbar adjustment but I think it will be sufficient for me in my home office. Shipping was fast and assembly was easy. I am not sure on the longevity but I will update my review if it doesn't hold up to daily use.UPDATE: I have been using this chair for over a month now and it certainly is not meant for full-time use. The height adjustment doesn't stay where it is set- you sink slowly over the course of the day. The lack of support means this is a good chair for a casual office but it you work full-time from home like I do- this chair won't cut it.",
