It's very comfortable and fits my home office with the other furnishings really well. This chair is built very good from the steel (chrome plated ) pedestal to the upholstery fine stitching. Another fine feature is the flap on the rear that covers the screws for the backrest. Easy to access with the vel-cro flap. So comfortable, It's hard to get me out of my office, but sometimes will wheel it out to watch TV. GREAT PURCHASE, AND WELL DESIGNED !!",

                "reviewText": "From the moment I clicked \"Purchase\" on the office chair through the provided link, I knew I was in for a treat, but I didn't realize just how much of a game changer this chair would be for my daily routine.Comfort is paramount in any office chair, and this one does not disappoint. The padding is plush and supportive, cradling the body perfectly throughout the workday. The adjustable lumbar support is a standout feature, providing the much-needed back support that's so important for someone like me who spends hours at a desk.But let's talk about the feature that I absolutely adore \u2013 the pull-out footrest. It's an absolute revelation! Whether taking a quick break to recharge or settling in for a more extended period of concentration, being able to kick back and elevate my feet is a luxury I didn't know I needed. It tucks away neatly when not in use, maintaining the chair's sleek appearance. The materials feel durable, and the mechanisms, like the height adjustment and tilt lock, operate smoothly and intuitively.To those considering an office chair, look no further. Whether you're typing away at reports, managing online meetings, or simply enjoying a moment of quiet contemplation, this chair, with its superb lower back support and pull-out footrest, will support you (quite literally) every step of the way.",

                "reviewText": "The chair was easy to assemble but some mechanical skills are helpful- how to use an allen key and how to tighten a couple of bolts. If you have a 12mm wrench at home and perhaps a 5mm hex socket it will be much faster. If not, the included tools work fine.I've used this for a couple of months now; I am working from home 50% with some 8-10 hours in the chair daily.It is very comfortable for me and the material feels nice. Good quality. I am 6ft2 tall and on the highest setting it is just right to keep my knees at 90 degrees. The armrests are adjustable in height, and by adjusting the bolts the width can also be adjusted. The angle of the seat can not be adjusted. Just the height.I bought an additional headrest/pillow on Amazon (see second picture) which fits perfectly and helps to keep my spine straight. Without the pillow my head is either 'free floating' (no rest) or leaned back. This might be ok for most people but I find the addition of the pillow made this chair even better.Support and customer service is very good. After a couple of months (outside the return window) I noticed that the chair seemed to be always tilted to one side but it changed as I turned it. I found that the base of the chair (the star-shaped metal part at the bottom where the rollers attach) was likely to blame because it was slightly uneven.I contacted the seller and they very quickly, within a week, sent me a replacement part free of charge no questions asked. Now it's perfect!I would recommend this chair.",

                "reviewText": "This chair is very high quality and the pictures do not do it justice. Im 6' 2\" and there is a ton of extra room. Its the most comfortable chair I have owned to date. I did buy a separate hydraulic piece to allow the chair to sit up higher but I put that on all of my chairs because the ones all chairs come with are too small. The recline feature and foot rest are surprisingly nice as well. I think anyone who buys this will be impressed but buy a big and tall hydraulic to really complete it.",

                "reviewText": "I took about an hour to assemble by myself. Compressing the back cushion against the seat cushion to install screws that hold back to seat was hardest part of project. Otherwise reasonably easy assembly. Providing a few extra screws and washers, just in case, was a nice touch.I've only sat in it a few minutes so far. Comfort is okay, not great. Too many smallish cushions in lumbar area are very mildly uncomfortable. Easily cured with thin pillow over lumbar area to even out all the bumps. And, as others have commented, headrest is set too far back to be at all useful. I suppose I could wrap some sort of additional cushion on top of existing headrest to bring it further forward. But these sort of ergonomic adjustments shouldn't be necessary these days. The issues are just too obvious to anyone who has sat in the chair for even a few seconds.Biggest complaint is that I ordered \"Light Brown\". I received \"Beige\". By beige, I mean band-aid flesh tone; far from my favorite color. I think I have seen similar complaint from at least one other reviewer. I don't know who has responsibility for picking products from the warehouse. But someone tends to be a little careless. Given what I've heard about Amazon warehouse working conditions, I'm certainly not going to pursue the point. And I'm not concerned enough personally to go through the hassle of disassembling and returning for an exchange.This chair is too ugly to use for formal office meetings. I guess it will become a knock-around utility chair. Remains to be seen how well this chair holds up after months or years of use. BTW, fresh out of the box, this upholstery smells like plastic, some version of vinyl I think. It's not overwhelming but definitely there. Hopefully, smell will go away eventually.",
