The \"massage\" is just a basic vibration, you can have 3 modes (pulse, constant, or variable) and can have it vibrate the seat, lumbar, and upper back all separately. The heating takes a minute to warm up, but it's not so long that it's a problem, and the heat is very pleasant and consistent. The microfiber is surprisingly soft, and the hydraulics for the up and down and the recline as very smooth. The seat was VERY easy to put together with very basic instructions.",

                "reviewText": "I was searching specifically for a massage chair, and the price attracted me to this one ($149 at the time). Let's put all our cards on the table though, this is not a shiatsu massage - it is a vibrating massage. And trust me, you can feel the difference. But, having said that, the price for the superior shiatsu massage chairs is prohibitive for me, so this is definitely second best.You can feel the vibrating in your upper thighs, lower back, and upper back between your shoulders. It feels just like if someone were to hold one of those vibrating wands to your back, but not move it around. It's not going to satisfy you as well as a moving massage, but it is better than nothing. I game for hours and this chair prevents my back from hurting.The chair was easy to assemble, included clear instructions, and everything worked out of the box. The remote has a simple monochrome liquid crystal display and does not feel cheap. It is responsive, even when the batteries are low. There is no battery strength indicator, but the display will turn from bold black to light black due to lack of battery strength.I like that the arms are padded, this prevents my elbows from getting sore while I use the keyboard. The chair isn't significantly plush, but it is comfortable nonetheless. Been using it daily for almost 2 months and has not broken or given me any problems. Only had to change the remote control batteries once, presumably because the included starter batteries are of low quality. A couple Duracell's in there should last awhile.I recommend this chair to someone that wants a massager, but can't afford a shiatsu.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this chair to replace my long, over-used gaming chair that is about 2 years old. I work from home and as a writer I spend a great deal of time in office chairs. I am also a decent sized fellow (6'2\" 225lbs.) so I need some tushy cushion.After a lot of looking and research, I know a chair with a 200 pound weight limit isn't going to hold up. I also know that I use these chairs much longer than most other users (average 12-15 hours per day). So when I do shop, I look for sturdy wheels, great padding and high weight limit. That all led me to this chair. My mistake.This chair had 1 of 3. The wheels are nice, and the same that came on my Songmics gaming chair. However, while the padding looks plush and thick and the weight limit is high enough, nothing is really there.The lumbar support is decent, and the heating is nice. Cord management is a nightmare, and the immobile arms are alright, but nothing special.The real pain is that there is basically nothing where your butt goes. Extra padding high on the seat back and a big fluff in the middle of the seat - where no legs will ever rest. But where your thighs sit and most importantly where the buttocks go... nothing. My tailbone is sore, my cheeks are numb and I hate this chair.Not to mention after using it for 10 days, the hydraulic lift is already starting to sink, though not much, it is noticeable.Going from bad to worse, I can't even return it. Apparently the 17 days it took to ship (with Prime) and the week I owned it before making up my mind to stop using it, were enough to not warrant a return of any kind.Unless you are 5'3\" and weigh less than 90 pounds, I'd shop for a different brand and model chair. This one is horrid.",

The bright red clashes with the office decor, but it's good to be the boss. After three weeks the chair has started suddenly falling back as the lever that controls tilt works its way out. The sudden falling backwards is a problem. In another chair from another company, I had to have the lever spot-welded in place because even epoxy kept cracking and the chair kept suddenly falling back. I'd give 4.5 stars except for this problem.",
