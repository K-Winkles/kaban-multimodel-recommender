                "reviewText": "Feels like a quality, sturdy product. The back and neck rest sit perfectly to my body. I like the locking mechanism on the tilt adjustment, if released without tension it doesn\u2019t fly forward. I switched out the wheels for roller blade wheels, but the wheels it came with feel sturdy. Assembly was very straightforward and simple. I\u2019m 5\u20194 and at it\u2019s lowest level my feet are not completely flushed with the floor, my toes do touch. However, the legs are metal so I feel comfortable placing my feet on them. Overall I\u2019m satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this chair.",

                "reviewText": "It's bee a while since I bought this item, but I have finally used it. It was easy to relatively assemble. I had my husband put it together since I have a limited lifting capacity.The big problem: the back does not adjust forward. It is springy, just like advertised - that isn't the problem. The back is situated too far back and I do not have any upper body support when I sit upright in it. This is a major problem because I see the support to sit and work using it. I do not have enough room under the desk to scoot all the way under it to take advantage of the support offered.Currently, I'm working on my second novel (The Order of Purity. First novel: The Order of the Cross will soon be available) so upper back support is crucial.If you need upper body support while sitting upright, do not buy this chair.",
