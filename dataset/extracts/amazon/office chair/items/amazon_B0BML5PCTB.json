                "reviewText": "I wasn't sure what to expect given the hype about this chair, so I was pleasantly surprised! Assembly is fast and easy and the final product is comfortable and sturdy. I like to sit in a variety of positions (none of which involve both feet on the ground) and this chair is wide enough to accommodate that . The backrest is at a good angle and has sufficient give to not feel constraining. I opted for the version with the boucle fabric and it's nice and soft but strong enough to withhold cats pawing at it. The price is a little daunting, but I feel that the product is well worth the cost.I am a size 14 and this chair could almost hold 2 of me (sitting in a traditional stance with both feet on the floor).",

The leather is soft and comfortable. It\u2019s wide, which is very nice, but not long enough in the front to comfortably cross my legs, which is what I was hoping for. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just the way we put it together, but it also sits a little weird. I feel like the chair leans me forward, which is not great while sitting at a desk. Overall it\u2019s a pretty good chair, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d purchase it again.",
