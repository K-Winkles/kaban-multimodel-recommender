                "reviewText": "My chair came well packaged and all parts were in great shape. I was expecting to spend a little time putting it together based on some reviews saying it was a difficult assembly. I can assure you it is very easy to assemble, and took about 15 minutes. The casters pop right on and then there are a handful of screws that attach the base and arms to the seating.The chair looks very nice and is quite comfortable. As far as quality it is bonded leather and some hard plastic parts. So this chair will not last 15-20 years. If you are looking for something that will last that long you will have to spend much more then $100. You don't want to clean bonded leather with chemical based cleaners because it will eventually eat away at it. Use mild soap & water and the material will last much longer. From my experience chairs made of these materials usually last 4-5 years if used daily and not abused.I am very happy with the chair and my personal opinion is you would be hard pressed to find something better in the $100 price range.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the gray leather version and it looks *really good*. Assembled everything in about 10 minutes (super easy).Just a reminder to not tighten down the arms before adding the chair back; it squeezes in tight then feels super-secure when you finish everything up (just follow the instructions).Best thing of all, the chair is very, very comfortable for me. I'm 5'8\" and about 180lbs; feels like it was made for me. Feels rather robust and decently constructed.I bought it because of the price but am soooo happy that I did. This is a HUGE UPGRADE over my old office store chair (that was twice the price...on sale). I've only had it a few days now but I do have to spend a lot of time planted into while working. Obviously, much better than the old chair. Surprisingly, much more comfortable than the 'high end' La-Z-Boy 'leather executive' chair that I have in the main office (also a nice chair just 5 times more expensive).My experience, so far, has been very favorable and I don't see any reason for that not to continue.",

                "reviewText": "Received this chair today. The chair was packaged really well and all parts were present. I've been sitting in it for just over an hour and honestly, my bottom hurts already. The seat is not super cushioned so it's not very comfortable. The rocking function is nice but could be dangerous, the base of the chair is not super heavy nor does it have any type of added weight to it so if your rocking back far, I could see someone tipping over. The stationary lumbar is comfortable for me and the tall chair back is nice. The padded arms are comfortable and fit nicely under my desk. I am only 5'1 so the chair is at it's lowest setting. If you are taller, and have the chair set higher, the arms may not fit under your desk. It'll be interesting to see how long the material on the chair lasts. It was easy to put together, my son-in-law managed to put it together in under 30 minutes. For the price, it's not bad but I'll definitely be investing in something more comfortable in the near future. If you are looking for an inexpensive chair that is somewhat comfortable but pleasing to the eye, I would recommend it. But if you are going to be sitting at your desk 8-10 hours a day like I do, I'd shop around a bit more.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the Homall Office Chair in March of 2022, with high expectations of comfort and functionality. I liked how the chair looked, its price point, and it received positive reviews. Unfortunately, my experience with this chair has been underwhelming, to say the least. Several issues, ranging from poor quality to difficult assembly, have left me deeply dissatisfied with my purchase.Let's start with the assembly process, which was an absolute nightmare. The instructions provided were not terrible, but not great either. It took me significantly longer than anticipated to assemble this chair, and I consider myself fairly handy. If you're not well-versed in putting together furniture, you may find yourself extremely frustrated.Another significant issue I encountered was with the chair's hydraulic cylinder. It has already started failing, causing the chair to slowly sink, regardless of the adjustment settings. This rendered the height adjustment feature useless and made for an uncomfortable seating position. I expected a durable and reliable chair, but sadly, this was not the case.The armrests were also a major disappointment. They started to deform and indent where my elbows and arms sit. The rest of the chair is fine. I can sit it in all day, so that is a positive. I mainly lean a bit forward and don't have time to lounge backward.On top of all these issues, the Homall Office Chair proved to be quite noisy. Whenever I shifted my weight or made any slight movements, the chair emitted creaking and squeaking sounds. Not only was it an annoyance, but it also disrupted my concentration while working and is embarrassing on conference calls. Having such a distracting and low-quality chair in a professional environment is disappointing.If I read this review I would have a couple of questions about the reviewer. I am 6'3\" but well below the recommended weight. I review plans and specs as part of my job, so I am good with instructions. My hobby is woodworking which requires skill and a calm demeanor. Yes, I did retighten any connectors that became loose through normal wear and tear.I should have spent more money on a quality chair since I am now looking to purchase a different chair 1 year later. I would advise others to take that into consideration. Spend a little more and keep less junk out of our landfills.",
