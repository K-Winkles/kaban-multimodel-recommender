I am a big boy so I will see how long it holds up. 2/7/22. EZ to apply. I recommend this over the 2 screw clamp.***2/8/22 So far this clamp holds tight. Make sure you clean all oil of the saft with a solvent of some kind. And snug the thumbscrew by hand. Test it for tightness and tighten some more. Do not over tighten. I like this product.*** 2/10/22 Not as secure as advertised. Post still slips through the clamp, but is better than without it. I will rough up the post to see if that helps.>>>To the seller/manufacturer: What will happen if I raise the post all the way and then drill a hole in the post just above the clamp? If I place a screw in the wall of the post, the post cannot slip down.March 6: Can't say I like it. It is not strong enough for my use. The only way this will work is if you are about 150 pounds and drill a screw hole in the tube so the clamp cannot slip down. Definitely NOT worth MY money.",
