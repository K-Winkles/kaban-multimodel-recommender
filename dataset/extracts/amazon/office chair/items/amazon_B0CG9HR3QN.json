                "reviewText": "This chair was fairly easy to assemble, came packaged well so that all pieces didn't mess up each other in shipping. There is only one thing wrong and that is I think that the wheels should have been bigger or bulkier for the size of the chair, because it can tip over if you are leaning back or rocking with it, if you don't have the wheels a certain way.The chair is very comfortable, I love being able to have armrest or no armrest when needed, love the option to rock or not. The height is adjustable, it is easy to wipe down and hair does not stick to it. Soft and not stiff UP Leather. Definitely happy that I bought it for my new craft/business desk. Looks great with the wood and black steel desk.",

The instructions were wonderful, but the screws to the arms were extremely difficult to line up & screw in. One we never could get it in all the way. Love that the arms will raise up & that you can lean it back a little or lock it so it won\u2019t lean back. All with the same lever that you raise & lower it. Thanks for the good instructions. Best instructions I\u2019ve seen in orders in a long time.",

It was pretty easy to put together and I would highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "I have some gripes, but it's also a step down from the big comfy high back chair that I'm used to. It went together with ease and everything was masked when I received it, so it's finishes were perfectly preserved. Not a single scratch....I was happily surprised. It feels solid and durable and provides some good lumbar support. I like the wheels and they are able to let me move around with ease, even on a thicker carpet. The tuck-away armrests are a nice touch that I'm getting used to.The chair itself feels like it would fit a shorter person much more comfortably because the back only comes up even with my shoulders (I'm 5' 9\"). Trying to recline and rest my head (had neck surgery recently) is nothing shy of a complicated feat. I wish this thing had a headrest and had I paid attention to the backrest meaurements, I would've never looked at it twice.I've been through quite a few office chairs in my lifetime and quite a few have proven their worth in cost vs comfort, so I have a pretty good sense of what works for me. When I typed in \"Highback Office Chair\", this showed up and I see that it wasn't catagorized properly. A highback is any chair that provides neck/head support...this ain't it and the shape of the back wasn't contoured for it. I'm probably going to give this one to my son and find one that fits the bill for me. As for the $150+ price tag (I paid $109 after coupon)... it's more like an $80 chair with some manufacturer gouging for good measure.",
