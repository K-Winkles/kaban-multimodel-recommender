                "reviewText": "This is a comfortable and fairly well-made office chair, especially compared to my previous one. And especially surprising for the price. It's easy to assemble; clear instructions, if a little small on the page.The only minor issue for me is that the lower back (lumbar) support is a little higher than I need at 5\u20194\u201d tall. This is important since I\u2019m trying to mitigate forward head posture, and proper lower back support is essential. And while I felt the difference immediately, a consumer should be aware that the lumbar support is not adjustable. Still, I think a small cushion will probably help, and the mesh chair back will be useful if I have to attach a small one. The good news is that after two days of use, I feel some relief already. I would have felt it almost immediately if it were not.",

I have to say, it is such a great upgrade from my folding chair while working in front of a compute at home. I have no idea how those expensive office chairs feel and I am sure that they must be very comfortable, but this one is already very comfortable to me. it feel solid with good lower back support. I am also using a support for my lower back with a cushion on top of the big seat, which really compliment the chair to give me the ultimate support. I also have a foot rest to raise my legs up so that my position is even more comfortable. All in all, it's a very good and comfortable chair.",
