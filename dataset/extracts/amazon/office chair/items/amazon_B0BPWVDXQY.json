                "reviewText": "The cushion is firm and comfortable. Very supportive. I am 5'6\" 130 lbs. The headrest is the Perfect height.Contrary to one of the reviews, it is very easy to assemble IF you follow the well presented instructions. The screw holes are absolutely well made. They even give you extra bits in case you lose a bolt or washer and everything is clearly marked so if you have trouble= you didn't follow the instructions.I moved to work from home over a month ago and come from using a $400.00 chair from a well known store. Albeit, I did just set this up and I have no reason to be sitting in this chair right now, but I can't help it, I am sitting in it nonetheless because it is comfortable and supportive. The instructions are the easiest I have ever encountered so don't be intimidated, just take your time and Follow The Instruction Manual.I am very pleased with this purchase. It arrived just 5 days after purchase, has adjustable lumbar support, the arms flip up, and it provides a generous range in height. I am so grateful. Since moving to work from home, I was sitting on an ottomon so you can best believe I am filled with relief. I am still going to purchase a back cushion because it does lean a little backward and I like to be perfectly upright... but I am one of those meticulously picky people. If you are approximately my height, you will love this chair. If you are larger than me... You might want to choose a different chair build for larger folks as again, the headrest is perfect for my height and I am 5'6\", any taller and your head will be higher than it and it does not adjust but screws securely into one place but the seat cushion feels firm enough to support a heavier person.Over all I am very please and so much looking forward to working 10 hour days with this chair. It is an huge improvement from the ottomon which was exhausting the daylight out of my back muscles to keep upright.Thank you to the maker of this chair. <3P.S. I said earlier that the headrest does not adjust: FALSE: It Does! Just 3 or so inches but still! NEAT. :)",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new office chair since I figured it was time to finally upgrade from my folding metal chair. This chair is much sturdier than I expected for the price, and it's very comfortable. The instructions for assembling it were relatively easy to follow.Customer support was also very easy to work with. I was initially sent the wrong item. When I messaged the seller, they contacted me on the next business day, asked me to send a couple of pictures, and sent me the correct item without asking me to return the one that was initially sent.My only complaint is that I'm a little tall for the head rest. I am 6'1 and the bottom of the head rest sits on my nape when it's raised up as far as it goes. It's not like I can't sit in the chair comfortably or anything like that. My head just doesn't rest in the exact right spot when I lean my head back. If it were a big issue, I could just remove the head rest and have a normal chair.Overall, it is an excellent chair. Before I was able to work from home, I had a nice chair in office that was very similar, but it was much more expensive. Comparing the two, I think this chair is on par with the one that cost over $200.",

                "reviewText": "So far, all things are great! It was super easy to put together! Fabric is a bit scratchy, but it's certainly not uncomfortable! Theres a lot of good padding in the arms and the seat, with nice adjustable back support. My only thing, that I find more entertaining than anything really, is that this chair is HUGE!! The seat alone is half my body height, and sure, im only 5'3, but I was terrified when I took it out of the box! Haha! I was worried it wouldnt be able to fit my desk right, but it worked out nicely! Its also nice that its a big chair since me and my cat can now fit together!The chair is built taller than the standard chair, fully extended my feet no longer touch the ground. But It works perfectly! The folding arms make it easy to pack under my desk. And the all black design, combined with the height of it, makes it look like a really cool villain chair. Especially compared to my other desk chair, haha!I love it, worth the price. And it was a really good laugh between me and my girl friend at the ridiculous sizing of everything as i put it together. 10/10 Especially if you have a needy cat or you shift sitting positions a lot. This chair has plenty of room for you to sit in whatever unconventional way you want!",

                "reviewText": "I chose this chair because it look like it would be a perfect fit for my room. The arms recline up, allowing it to tuck in nicely to my desk but little did I know I was going to have issues with the chair that I could not foresee. Whether it was the arm falling off because the nylon locking nut was stripped before I could get it out of the box and going to a hardware store to find a replacement. Another issue I had was the material that\u2019s wedged into the groove of the chair was slipping out on the top corners; allowing the fabric to lose its tension and making it very difficult to get it back into its place. I found the lumbar support adjustment is very little to none. When getting out and back in your chair, the lower lumbar resets itself, since it doesn\u2019t look into place. The last straw was trying to get in contact with the company to get a warranty/replacement part for the chair backing that broke. I reached out multiple but no resolution was reached. Therefore I am putting it out on the curb as I write this review and thankful I didn\u2019t double down and buy the chair again just to get my replacement part. Think twice before spending your money with a company with poor/no customer service.",
