                "reviewText": "This is an all around amazing chair. The charger cord was missing from the box though. I contacted the seller and they were swift about sending me one free of charge was just a bit of a wait for it and I couldn't pay for expedited shipping for the cord but that isn't important. I am a big guy, with my old chair I had to use a chair cushion and was all tight and made noises when I sat and turned. This one complete 100% better. I can plop sit on this chair. Lean all the way back without feeling I'd fall. Perfect arm wrests, and seat size and cushion. I'm so very grateful for a chair like this in my line of work. Also I am very happy with support making sure I got this cord for the vibration of the chair which feels amazing. Also the installation was not bad at all whatsoever. Was actually easier putting this together than it was a smaller one. I hope this helps you make a choice. I'd choose this seller. Thank you very much.",

                "reviewText": "Got the package assembelled all the chair Finally the part where U connect the line to the socket to turn the massager on, I figured out that the line is the damaged and not working. I contacted the support and they told me that they will respond in 24 hours. This is the 7th day that I never got a response from them. However once you assemble the chair it\u2019s too hard to turn it back to original and return so ONCE YOU BUY THIS POOR PRODUCT YOU\u2019RE STUCK WITH IT AND IT\u2019S A WASTE OF MONEY.",
