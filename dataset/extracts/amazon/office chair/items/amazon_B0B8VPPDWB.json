I found that just like the comments said, that the chair was super easy to assemble, but did take heed of the comments that found the degradation of the chair as a caution given the price of said chair. what I'd like to say is that its structure and support is what I was lacking and what drove me to get a new chair, I do not spend all day in one, but I do spend a considerable amount of time, so I wanted something that I knew would last me a decent amount of time. for those who only have so munch money so spend on something like this, then I'd this is worth the money and time you take to assemble it. for better or worse that is.",

                "reviewText": "this is a tad difficult to review. there are some things that i like about the chair, and some things that i don't. first off the installation was fairly easy. standard, if you've ever put an office chair together before.the material of the chair seems decent enough. it's easy to clean up if your kid happens to spill their juice all over it...i also like that the back of the chair is adjustable. and it stays where you adjust it to. my old chair you could lean back in it, but you had to physically keep it pushed back the whole time. i like that i can angle this back to where i need it at any given time. it easily adjusts up and down with the lever on the right hand side.now to comfort. it takes some getting used to. at first i'll say honestly i hated sitting in this chair. and i was about to toss it on the road for free. it takes a loooooong time to break this chair in to where it's comfortable. first off the sides of the seat hit your thighs weird. unless of course you are the size of a stick, and then i'm sure this would be fine right out of the box. but for those of us who have a bit of junk in our trunks, it can be rather uncomfortable to sit in, until you break the chair in enough. the headrest on the back of the chair to me is useless. i'm apparently too short to be able to use it properly. and i hate the lumbar support pillow that comes with this as well. it does nothing, except make me sit weird and be even more uncomfortable. i'm really glad that it is removeable.overall, this chair is decent. i'm not sure i'd ever pay this price again for this chair. but for the most part i'm starting to not hate it like i did when i first got it. so if you are taller than 5'4\", and not overly chubby, and you have the patience to break in this chair, go for it.",
