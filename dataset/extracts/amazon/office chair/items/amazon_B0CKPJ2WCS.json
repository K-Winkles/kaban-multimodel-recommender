                "reviewText": "I only just assembled this chair but it seems like it should be a good purchase. The seat is comfortable and I like that the arms can be lifted because sometimes I find arms get in the way depending on how I am sitting at a desk.Assembly of the legs and seat was easy. Attaching the back to the arms was tricky and I ended up doing the bolts out of order from the instructions in order to get them to align. Not that hard once I made the switch but I definitely spent more time fighting with it than I expected. I do appreciate the good hex wrench that was provided as it made screwing in the bolts faster and less straining on the hands than the little cheap ones products usually include.Only other gripe is there is some loose stitching on one of the arms that I didn\u2019t notice until I was well into the assembly. I\u2019ll just cut the strings and hope it holds up. For the money I am overall pleased with the product.",

The base is sturdy and the wheels move well on my carpet. The pleather or whatever it is, seems durable and it's easy to clean.The fold up arms were a must for me to keep the chair pushed under my desk out of the way when not in use. Good feature.I do wish the back would recline independently from the seat but you just don't get all the bells and whistles for 69.99. This is an easy 5 star at that price.",

It hasn\u2019t squeaked yet which is great. I do wish the seat part was bigger as I like to sit with my legs cross crossed but I am 5\u201910 and have long legs so there\u2019s not a lot of room to do that with this chair. My boyfriend was able to easily assemble it within about 10-15 minutes",
