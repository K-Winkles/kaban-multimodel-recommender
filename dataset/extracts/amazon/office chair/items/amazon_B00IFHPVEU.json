                "reviewText": "I recently turned a spare bedroom into an office and needed a nice chair to go with my new desk.After comparing several different chairs from retail stores and several on Amazon I decided to order this one.My decided factor was ultimately the price. I do not work from home and just use my office a few days a week, a couple hours at a time so I didn't need a $200+ chair. I didn't want the mesh back and I like the fact that this one has the arms and it is super padded and comfortable to be a smaller chair.As far as size, my husband who is almost 200lb, could sit in it comfortably. Anyone 200lb+ or on the taller side, this chair is probably not the best choice. I also can't say how comfortable it would be if you WFH and use it multiple hours a day.Overall, I am super happy with my purchase and the quality of the chair. I also want to add that putting it together was pretty easy. Leave the arms loose until you get the back on then tighten everything up.",

I also ordered a carpet protector in plastic to put this on in my home office. Definitely buy this chair.",

                "reviewText": "I will say up front that I am not a mechanically inclined person. I am more of the IT, logical type, so take that into account.I found this to be frustrating to put together. You open the paper that came with it and they give you a lay out of the items included in the box, tell you how to care for the chair and such. No instructions on how to assemble, it immediately goes into other languages, I assume for the same information that was provided on the first page. So, I started my best to assemble as it looks fairly easy. I got to one step that I was having trouble with and in frustration happened to pick up the little book from the back. There were the instructions.What logic tells you to burry the instructions 10 pages deep after covering useless information in a 1/2 dozen different languages. The like all these kinds of products, there wasn't really any directions just images and you are left to try and pick out what the writer means. I guess it was too complicated to write directions. How about this - if you are too lazy to write out detail directions to go along with your images, at least include a URL, Qcode to a video that shows the customer someone assembling it.All that said, I was able to assemble the char in about 20 minutes, sat in it for a bit and found it to be uncomfortable. I am maybe 5'6 ant 200 pounds, this chair fit really well on the seat part but came up to below my shoulder blades. This caused the bone to rub on the top of the chair.Additionally, the predrilled holes didn't 100% align, so precision and design were gaps when it comes to this product.Product returned",

                "reviewText": "This office chair is a great product FOR THE PRICE POINT!!! If you're over 6 feet tall or 250 pounds or both this is NOT the chair for you. Also, if you're used to very expensive, professional, office furniture at your workplace, this is NOT the chair for you. I didn't want to spend over $100 for a reasonably comfortable home office chair and this product fit the bill perfectly.Several reviewers have remarked that the assembly process was not the easiest. I used the tools pictured in the attached photo and it was fairly straight forward with a clear & easy to follow instruction manual. Overall (to include unboxing), the entire process took me about 30 minutes. If I had only used the Allen wrench provided to assemble the chair, the process would been somewhat more challenging and time consuming.Additionally, some reviewers have commented that sitting in this chair for more than 2 or 3 hours at a time is uncomfortable. Well, I have a $1,000, ergonomic chair at work and that's also uncomfortable after sitting in it for 2 or 3 hours. So for frequent home office work less than 45 minutes at a time, this chair is great. For serious, full time, work-from-home 8 hours a day, you'll have to spend a lot more to be comfortable.FOLLOW UP: After about 10 months of almost daily use my original comments above remain the same. The chair is still in great shape and working well for less than an hour at a time. Wheels aren't the best even on a tiled surface, but if that's what I wanted, I would have spent a lot more money. Still very happy with this purchase.",

Reviewing it after using for a month.MaterialLeatherette cover over soft cushionSturdy plastic base and wheels (I wanted a steel one for more strength, but this is quite good to be honest)Wheels are very good quality and roll effortlesslyPadded arm rest for comfortDesignVery comfortable and spacious seating size wise (my husband with a bulky frame fits in comfortably on the chair) Arm rest is fixed and height cant be adjusted but it's fixed at a great comfortable heightCan carry heavy weight more than what is mentioned in the description, tested upto 114 kgs and the chair doesn't creak.It's a mid back chair, for me the back rest reaches a little below the shoulders when sitting upright. I am 5'9\" tall. The back is upright but not to an extent where it gets uncomfortable while splitting straight and working.Amazingly light weight. Have another chair from the brand featherlite purchased from a dealer in the same price range. This one hands down beats the featherlite chair.Super easy to assemble on your own, comes with instructions to assemble.All adjustments levers available for adjusting tilt and heightGo for it without any 2nd thought. Best product at this price range",

                "reviewText": "**ACTUALIZACI\u00d3N- 15 DE DICIEMBRE 2018**Que otra cosa puedo decir acerca de la silla, ha durado a pesar del uso diario que se le da. El cojinete no ha perdido su forma y la silla se ha mantenido firme sin aflojarse ni nada de eso. Comenz\u00f3 con unos ligeros rechinidos pero eso se debe a que la zona donde se encuentra la silla hay mucho polvo as\u00ed que le tuve que dar una peque\u00f1a limpiada y lubricada y qued\u00f3 muy bien. Se sigue reclinando bien y sigue igual de c\u00f3moda a pesar que se han sentado personas desde 50 a 100 kilos jeje.**ACTUALIZACI\u00d3N-7 DE ABRIL 2018**Despu\u00e9s de casi 3 meses de uso la silla sigue funcionando como nueva. Recibe bastante uso d\u00eda tras d\u00eda y el respaldo/asiento de la silla han mantenido su forma y sigue igual de c\u00f3moda.El \u00fanico detalle es que las tapitas de los tornillos se comenzar\u00e1n a salir por si solos con el tiempo, adjunto fotos para que vean las tapitas. En el caso de muchos pues se les podr\u00eda aplicar un poquito de silic\u00f3n para que fijen bien pero sin quedarse super pagadas (no recomendar\u00eda el uso de Kola Loka) Yo en lo personal le pondr\u00e9 solo lo suficiente para que no se zafen pero no tanto como para que se quede super pegado y las pueda retirar en caso de ser necesario. Este detalle no afecta el funcionamiento de la silla para nada, es meramente un detalle est\u00e9tico y por lo cual no le quitar\u00e9 estrellas a mi evaluaci\u00f3n. He revisado si los tornillos siguen apretados y a pesar del uso que se le da a la silla siguen bien y fijos. El mecanismo hidr\u00e1ulico para bajar y subir la silla no se utiliza tanto as\u00ed que sigue funcionando a la perfecci\u00f3n, la sigo recomendando :)**RESE\u00d1A ORIGINAL**Le regal\u00e9 esta silla a mi mam\u00e1 para que tenga mayor comodidad en su negocio y le gust\u00f3 much\u00edsimo. Comparto mi rese\u00f1a para todo aquel interesado en el producto. Espero y le sirva de algo a alguien. Saludos!La silla viene en una caja con todas las piezas necesarias para armarla. el instructivo viene en espa\u00f1ol, franc\u00e9s e ingl\u00e9s.Para ser sincero est\u00e1n escritas de tal manera que cualquier persona podr\u00e1 armarla ya que viene muy bien explicado todo y con las herramientas necesarias para armarla. Yo me tard\u00e9 unos 10 minutos en armarla y qued\u00f3 muy bien.Las rueditas giran bien y no tienen mayor fricci\u00f3n en el piso de porcelanato del negocio de mi mam\u00e1. No les sabr\u00eda decir que tan bien rodar\u00eda en una alfombra pero creo que siempre y cuando no est\u00e9 muy gruesa rodar\u00e1 bien.El material se de piel suave, aunque es un poco delgada y se siente fr\u00e1gil con buen cuidado que se le d\u00e9 (como todo producto) durar\u00e1 buen tiempo funcionando y luciendo como debe de ser.La altura total del asiento al momento de extenderla hasta su punto m\u00e1ximo es de unos 55 cent\u00edmetros, altura est\u00e1ndar.Me gust\u00f3 que tambi\u00e9n es posible ajustarla para que se pueda reclinar un tanto sin perder su estabilidad.La \u00fanica observaci\u00f3n que hago es que cuando se est\u00e9 armando tomen precauci\u00f3n de no sobre apretar los tornillos ya que estos se pueden barrer. En cuanto sientan que topen ya no le aprieten m\u00e1s jeje.Fuera de eso no tengo ninguna queja. A mi mam\u00e1 le encant\u00f3. Saludos!",
