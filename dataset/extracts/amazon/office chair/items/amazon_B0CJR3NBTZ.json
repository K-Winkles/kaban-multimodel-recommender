This chair does well. He says it is comfortable and feels sturdy. Assembly was easy, only about 15 minutes. The cushion isn\u2019t extremely thick, so hopefully it will hold up over time. At the current price of $199 it seems to be a bit overpriced compared to similar chairs. It also came with a few scratches but nothing too major.",

I can only describe it as what I assume they have in the big and tall waiting room in heaven. It is super comfortable and it feels like I can gain double my weight (350 if you're nosy) and it still would be able to hold me with ease. You can feel the quality when assembling it. The base is super strong, it feels really good on your back, I can't say enough good things. HIGHLY recommended!",

This one is great--super easy to assemble (15 mins max), comfortable, height and tilt adjustments, and perfect for those of us who are a bit heavier.I got this for my home office, but may invest in another for my desk at work as well. Truly a great buy, though I do think the price is a bit high. I'm used to paying the \"big and tall\" tax but this feels a bit rich--$125-$150 would be fairer in my opinion.",
