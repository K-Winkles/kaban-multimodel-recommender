                "reviewText": "The chair was packed very well and easy to put together. The wrench you need for the bolts was included. A nice set of directons was provided.The chair is solid and the material is soft and comfortable feeling. You can adjust the height, how much tilt, or have no tilt. It roosl really easily on my rug and wood floors. So for a basic chair it hits all the right marks.However, I do not find the chair to fit me well and it is a bit uncomfortable. If using for a short time it is no problem. However, for long use I didn't enjoy it. I do think chairs are a personal fit so when buying one online you risk having one that just doesn't suit your body well. This chair is not deep enough for me and I do not find any lumbar support. Again, this is a personal thing.The ad states that the arms flip up but they do not!",

                "reviewText": "This chair is very well machined and therefore easy to assemble. My only advice is to leave all 8 screws loosely threaded when attaching the arm rests, then tighten once finished before inserting the screw covers. That makes inserting the back of the chair a breeze. It is also important to note that the arm rest are fixed and do not flip up to slide under a low clearance desk. I actually prefer that the arm rests are not movable as it makes for a sturdier chair.I am 6'3\" and the chair fits me perfectly. I also keep it adjusted as low as it goes. My wife is a foot shorter than I and her feet don't touch the floor at that setting. Smaller women will probably need a foot stool.The cushions are very soft and comfortable, and the faux black leather feels supple and should be easy to keep clean. The five legs of the chair have enough diameter that when I roll from one desk to another there is no risk of tipping over. All in all, I highly recommend this office chair.",

                "reviewText": "Good average office chair. Assemply was easy and after it was assembled, it was solid. Parts fit well together and it was not loose at the joints. Lots of padding on the chair makes it almost pillowy. This chair was definitely made for the average sized person though. If you are of the larger variety, or of the shorter variety, you might it a little wanting.For the shorter people, this chair sits very high. Im a taller person and normally I have to extend the chair to its highest extension before I can sit comfortably in it. With this chair, I was sitting comfortably at almost the lowest spot. I asked a friend of mine, who is 5'7\" to sit in it, and her legs were dangling off the ground.The chair shows a weight limit of 275lbs, and I would not push it much past that, not that it would be comfortable anyways. The chair is narrow, side to side, and for a larger persion the armrest bars dig into the sides of my thighs and makes it uncomfortable. Also, the seat is not very deep. I always get that \"Im sliding out\" feeling.But if you are of average size and build, this would be a good, comfortable, and probably long lasting chair to have.",
