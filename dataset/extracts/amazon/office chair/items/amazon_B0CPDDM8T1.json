                "reviewText": "I read some reviews of this chair being uncomfortable, and I see why people feel that way. The cushion is a very firm latex material, so if you are looking for plush, this isn't your chair.It's not like sitting on a concrete bench or aluminum bleacher seat, and the latex slowly conforms around you. The mesh back and arms that fold up are nice features. Otherwise, it is a typical office chair.Are you getting a perfect chair? No. It is more than serviceable though. It is missing those final touches you would see on a higher end chair.Things like plastic flashing around areas where parts were pulled out of the mold, screw holes not in perfect alignment are my main complaints. When you assemble the chair, keep all the bolts loose until they are all installed, and then tighten.With all that said, it is a very sturdy, firm chair that does what a chair should do. I spend 8 plus hours in it daily, and it has shown zero indications of weakness. Being 220lbs at 6' with a boney backside, I can say I really like this chair.",

Not only is the color stunning, but the chair itself is extremely comfortable and has all the features I was looking for in an office chair.One of the best things about this chair is its ergonomic design. As someone who spends long hours at my desk, having a chair that supports my back and promotes good posture is essential. I have noticed a significant improvement in my back pain since using this chair. The mesh material also allows for good air circulation, keeping me cool and comfortable throughout the day.I was pleasantly surprised to find that my 8-year-old son also loves this chair. He often uses it to do his homework or play on the computer, and he appreciates the adjustable height and width. This feature allows the chair to grow with him, making it a long-term investment.Another great aspect of this chair is how easy it was to assemble. It only took me 30 minutes to put together, and I didn't even need the manual.",

                "reviewText": "This Ergonomic Office Chair came with the screws, an Allen wrench, and an easy to follow instruction diagram. It took me less than 19 minutes to assemble. The back is a breathable nylon mesh which allows airflow and keeps you cool. The seat cushion is also covered in the same breathable nylon mesh. The arm rests rotate up out of the way if you need to roll closer to the desk or push the chair in all the way when not sitting in it. The chair rotates smoothly and easily. It rolls on the wheels with no issues. The height adjustment arm under the seat is a little short or it could be that my arm is a little short. Hahaha! But it works well with no issues. Most of the chair parts are plastic except for the air piston and adjustment arm assembly, which are metal. According to the listing it has been SGS Lab tested to have no loss of serviceability after 120,000 cycles of rotation with 270 lbs. on it. Sounds like it should last a while. It's a fair deal for the price at the time of $59.99. I will update the review down the road if there are any issues. Right now, I am happy with it.",

Have assembled many, many office chairs and have never had this issue before- One of the threaded inserts for one of the armrests had a defect, making it impossible to get the bolt fully screwed in. The other side went in very smoothly, so the contrast was stark- Back mesh has give, but the back itself is quite rigid. Would not be a comfortable chair for people who lean back by default (poor lumbar support). I perch on chairs, so that isn't a problem for me- White plastic components scuff very easily",
