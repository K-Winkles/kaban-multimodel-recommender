I followed directions & got the wheels on (what I thought would be hard since I had read reviews but was the easiest-except to take the wheels back off). Then I went to do the rest & found out that the back support was cracked/broken (it didn't come in a very sturdy box so I'm thinkingit got damaged while being mailed). I wasn't happy & attempted to take the wheels off to send back but I couldn't. So after an hr of trying I gave up and put the dang chair together. With the back support being broke I am unsure how well this will work or how long so it's disappointing. I need a chair though desperately with my back issues and when I have to work from home.Update:They sent me another back support that wasn't damaged. It's a good chair & comfortable",

Chair #1\u2019s mesh back had a hole, as well as loose threads around the edges. I had already partially assembled the chair and didn\u2019t want to make the effort to return and wait for a replacement. Chair #2\u2019s seat fabric was already stretched after the first sitting. Again, it was already assembled and I didn\u2019t want to have to go through the hassle of returning it. For reference, my son is barely 60 lbs and the seat fabric still stretched out.The wheels were difficult to put in at first, but I used the blade of the scissors to \u2018scrape\u2019 and wide the openings a little and the wheels snapped right in.Overall, this is a good chair. Pretty comfortable, modern look and durable build, all which make it worth the affordable price. If I wanted a perfect chair, I\u2019d definitely have to up my budget.",

                "reviewText": "I felt obligated to write a review since literally none of the reviews here were helpful / had pictures. So, firstly - this chair is hard to build if you haven\u2019t built something like this before, and the instructions are a little confusing, so be warned. The wheels do not just \u201cpop in\u201d; I spent maybe 30 minutes trying to figure out what I was doing wrong before someone came to help me and they decided to hammer in the wheels.WITH THAT BEING SAID - this chair is amazing for the price. It\u2019s comfortable (not SUPER comfortable but I went from sitting on a wood-and-metal accent chair for a year to this so obviously this feels amazing to me) and offers great back support! Plus it\u2019s bright neon pink - I thought the colors would end up being duller than the picture but I was very wrong. I\u2019m happy to say that the pink chair looks EXACTLY the same as the stock photo. It also has adjustable height and tilts back, if you\u2019re interested in that.The only real downside is that the white plastic gets scratched / nicked easily, but honestly for a cute hot pink $80 chair I can live with that.If anything changes I\u2019ll update; I only just got this chair yesterday so I can\u2019t be sure how long it will hold up.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I mainly got the chair for its looks and price value. The design and color are really nice, but I can't say the same for the design in terms of assemblage. The instructions were very clear, no issues there, but the actual assembling was pretty painful. Make sure to have another set of hands and something to hammer with. I managed to put 3/5 of the wheels in with my bare hands, but the last 2 were actually impossible, had to hammer them in so be prepared. The hammering wasn't so bad, make sure you hit the black part and not the wheels or it'll get destroyed. The painful part was the screwing. None of the screw holes lined up and I needed an extra pair of hands to push and hold them together to line up.As per the picture, the design of the holes is terrible. Why put a thinner oval shape to put the screw through when the hole is a circle. The screw didn't fit and if you force it, it'll destroy the plastic handle. That's why they gave a washer I guess, but when the holes already don't line up, putting a washer that prevents vision of where you're screwing made the process extremely difficult. You can assemble it given some time, but it was really unnecessarily difficult for no reason. I have assembled more complicated office chairs in less time.In terms of comfort, the chair is okay. The cushion isn't super plush, but it does offer support and you can easily put a cushion on top. The seat itself isn't too big if you like to sit criss-cross, but it still works somewhat for me with my knees protruding (5'3\", 120lb) Other than that, the office chair works well.Update: I have come back a year later of using this chair to just say it's not a comfortable chair and I wish I have invested in a better chair for comfort. If you plan to sit on it often, it will definitely give you back pain in the long run and have you feel stiff after long hours on it. Maybe it just isn\u2019t catered to my sitting positions as it doesn\u2019t support the right areas for me. I will be looking to upgrade my chair and just use this one as a spare.",

The chair's padding looks softer than it is and it is not fun trying to keep it clean because it dirties easily. Putting together was not too bad but seemed very thin as if the plastic wheelbase would break right away but it lasted a little longer than the up and down feature which gave way soon so now it sits too low.
