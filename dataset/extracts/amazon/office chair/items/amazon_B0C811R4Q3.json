                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This product came packaged well and was easy to assemble. The instructions were clear and have diagrams to quickly assist you in building. A second person is helpful in aligning and screwing the back on; but not required. That was the hardest part of assembly.Overall the chair is very comfortable. I like that it's a wider and thicker seat than most. It tilts back. The armrests lift up - which is nice if you don't want to use them while sitting or to push the chair under a desk. The height adjustment is nice. I think short and tall people will find an appropriate sitting height given it''s options. My 5'2\" mother felt comfortable in it. It feels solid. I'm 5\"11 and 330lbs and I feel comfortable in this chair after 8 hours of working from home in it. It does not feel cheap. I wear an insulin pump in my pocket and I was worried about getting in and out of the chair and having enough space to not grab at my pocket pump, and that issue does not exist. It's' great!My only complaint is that the upgraded casters do not glide very easily on carpet as advertised. It would easily glide on business/commercial grade carpet, but not average carpet inside a home/home office. They do work very well on hardwood/solid surfaces. They are a nicer caster than most chairs. I would, and will rebuy this chair. I'm purchasing another when they go on sale again for my other office desk.I would recommend this chair to anyone, especially larger individuals. Its sits well. It's also attractive in design.",

                "reviewText": "The original chair would not tilt (rock) at all. Contacted the company and after sending them some photos, they advised they would send a replacement seat plate part. I finally got the replacement part after a weather related delivery delay, and after some struggle to get the base off gas lift I was able to get the replacement plate installed. When first using the chair with the new part it still would not tilt/rock. After some testing I finally got the chair to rock but ONLY if the seat height is not all the way up!Very strange. I'm not fully satisfied with the chair, for for now I do find it acceptable.Needless to say, I won't be getting another item from this company due to this design flaw.",
