                "reviewText": "I've WFH for a few years now and gone through a wide variety of seating arrangements (couch, bed, decorative display chair, dining room, \"gamer\" chair, and now this one). This one has been by far the best one, long-term.- Mid-range in price: Not cheap, but half the cost of most executive-style chairs.- Easy assembly: I put it together myself in under an hour and took my time doing so. You will need a good amount of open space and either a bed/table for comfortable assembly, but that feels like a \"given\" to me as opposed to a drawback.- Comfortable all day: I both WFH at my desk and most of my hobbies are done at a desk. I am in this chair 8+ hours a day (with plenty of breaks for stretching) and it's very comfortable. I have had chairs in the past that exacerbated my back pain, have cut off circulation in my legs, etc. but this one has never given me those problems.- Folding arms: The arms of the chair fold up and down at your will and will remain there. Not slippery at all, but not a chore to move. Great for tucking the chair away once you're done with it, if you need just one arm, or whatever.- Smooth rolling: The chair rolls around smoothly on hardwood but doesn't go sliding like the floor's been waxed. Feels like a good balance for mobility, both when seated and when standing and moving it around.- Breathable backing: Back of the chair has a soft mesh that's pulled taut. Provides breathability in the hotter months and decent support when you lean back against it.Overall, I really like this chair. Definitely great if you need a comfortable office chair but can't quite spring for a higher end one. I've been using it for a few months now and I haven't regretted a single day with it.",

                "reviewText": "Like many people who formerly worked in an office, I started working remotely in March 2020. My company was going through a merger at the time and we closed down an office so I was able to take home a VERY high-quality chair.I continued working for that company full-time until last summer but stayed in a part-time capacity in order to help with the transition. I recently ended that and offered to return the chair and my computer equipment. I didn't think they'd want it back since they had moved again in the meantime.I had to desperately find a replacement quickly. I had bought cheap office chairs before and knew those would not be an option. I spend all day in my office so it had to be as close to the commercial quality level as I could get without costing anything like the commercial ones do.This chair had better reviews than most and was reasonably priced so I gave it a shot. Delivery was fast. I was able to assemble it easily and have used it for a couple of weeks now.The seat is comfortable. I'm a fairly large dude (235 lb) so airline seats can be uncomfortable. This chair's seat is plenty wide. I also like that the arms fold up so I can push the chair under the desk when I'm not using it.It does lean back - but not as far as what I was used to with the commercial office chair.The biggest reason I didn't give it five stars - it doesn't seem possible to adjust it nearly as well as the higher-end chairs. It goes up and down and there's a manual sliding lumbar support. I always feel like I'm leaning forward a tad and can't find a way to adjust that.Overall - I'd recommend it compared to cheaper chairs but if you can afford it - buy a more expensive one to get more comfort and more adjustability.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my home office. I use it mostly when scrapbooking, so I spend many hours at a time on it. It is so comfortable! I never have a backache or sore body from it. The craftsmanship is very good and it is quality made. It was very easy to put together. It looks classy and glides easily when turning or moving across the floor. I have had many office chairs over the years, and I can honestly say that this is by far my favorite one, for all of these reasons. I especially like the mesh back. It keeps me cool and makes the chair look very high-end. I love this chair!",

The chair is incredibly sturdy and well-built, and I have no doubt that it will last me for many years to come. The seat and backrest are both very comfortable, with just the right amount of padding to keep me comfortable during long hours at my desk. The chair also has a variety of adjustable features that make it easy to customize to my needs. The height adjustment is smooth and easy to use, and the armrests can be adjusted to the perfect height and width for my body. Additionally, the chair has a tilt feature that allows me to lean back and relax during breaks without worrying about tipping over. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the this office chair. It is a high-quality, comfortable, and adjustable chair that has significantly improved my work experience. I would highly recommend this chair to anyone in need of a comfortable and supportive office chair. 5 stars!",
