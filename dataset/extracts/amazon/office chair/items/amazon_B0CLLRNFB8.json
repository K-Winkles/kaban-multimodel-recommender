                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the SIHOO M102C Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair, and it has exceeded my expectations in every way. As someone who spends long hours at the desk, comfort and support are paramount, and this chair delivers on both fronts.The high back design provides excellent lumbar support, and the mesh material promotes breathability, keeping me cool even during extended work sessions. The 3D armrests are a game-changer, allowing me to customize the chair to my preferred height and angle for maximum comfort.The assembly was straightforward, thanks to clear instructions and well-packaged components. The chair feels sturdy and well-built, and the adjustable features make it adaptable to various body types and work preferences.Not only that, but it helped my back problems! I was going to the chiropractor every week and after changing my chair, I no longer need to go.Overall, the SIHOO M102C is a fantastic addition to my home office. It combines ergonomic design with durability and style, making it a smart investment for anyone seeking a high-quality office chair. I highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "This is my first \"ergonomic\" chair coming from regular office chairs and gaming chairs, and I have to say I'm definitely impressed with it.The box it comes in is large and everything is packed nicely and secure inside. There was no damage at all to any of the parts and pieces and everything was wrapped. If there's one thing I hate about some chairs is that the bits can get damaged in the box, but there was little chance of that happening with this chair.But the thing that impressed me the most at first was the tool they give you to assemble it with. Instead of a standard allan key they give you one that has an actual handle on the end. It's so nice that I actually kept it instead of just tossing it aside with the rest of the packing material like I usually do once assembly is complete.It's an easy to assemble chair, perhaps not the easiest chair I've ever put together but it definitely is not a challenge. The base of the chair is all metal instead of plastic like most chairs, so I feel like it will last a long time instead of simply snapping. I must say though that I didn't test the caster wheels. I have a set of roller blade wheels I immediately installed on the chair and haven't used the included ones whatsoever.After assembly is complete you're left with a pretty comfortable chair. The lumbar support, which is adjustable, has almost become my favorite part of the chair. But the biggest feature for me is the fact that the arms actually raise up. So many chairs have fixed arms that you can't move out of the way and it's become something I can't live without.I think for the price you simply can't find a better, higher quality chair on Amazon. Most of the chairs on here are from random brands that have no quality control and will not stand behind their products. I trust this chair to last a few years, and that's more than I can say about the last few chairs I have purchased.",

It takes about 30-40 mins to assemble super clear instructions and in the end it\u2019s worth it. Sitting feels amazing, no more back discomfort or neck discomfort with the built in ergonomic back and head rest, everything is adjustable and it\u2019s very sturdy and made of high quality plastic and mesh. Would buy again!",

                "reviewText": "So I did a lot of research and YouTube videos to come across this brand. Originally thought I wanted a gaming chair but most IT professionals say they suck.So delivery was smooth as always. I fix railcars for a living so assembly was a no brainer. Took about 10 minutes. Nice touches included though. Comes with an M6 T handle for assembly. All bolts pre Loctited with blue. Bolts come blister packed with super easy visual instructions so even my mechanically challenged father could have put this together albeit it probably would have taken him an hour.As for comfort. I'm 5'10\" 220 lbs. Works for me. Gas chamber seems pretty strong for up down. Leg assembly is all metal. You attach the legs like spokes with the afore mentioned pre Loctited bolts (M6 if it matters). The memory cushion seat seemed really stiff at first, but within two hours was firm yet comfortable. Height adjustment was perfect. 18 1/2\" on the low to 22\" on the high, measured to the top of seat cushion from floor. My measurements might be slightly (1/4\") off as I ditched the stock casters for a $20 polyurethane wheel kit from here as I know most of the OEM form factor ones are junk. Arm rests are great with adjustable front to rear and sideways in//out. No up/down. Lumbar support is great for my degenerative discs. Adjustable up/down. Headrest also nice with adjustable tilt forward and back, no up/down. Arms fold up so you can tuck this under your desk. Widest base width at the spoke is about 28\" for your desk opening.My only gripe is that it doesn't have locking reclining features. Reclines with a knob underneath to adjust firmness of the recline. But that's it. I would almost like it to recline slightly FORWARD with my back problems as it would allow the lumbar support to align a little better. But for the price ( about $175 with the poly wheel kit) I can't complain much. Why I only gave it 4 stars.Everything else seems top notch! Well packaged, quality materials, easy assembly and instructions.FYI, seat it fabric, not PU leather. Armrests too.If I was much taller, I don't think this chair would work as the backrest wouldn't line up correctly. For me it works.Tried to be as inclusive as possible to fill in the gaps not covered in the product description.Best All!",
