                "reviewText": "This chair seemed to have consistent positive reviews, so I ordered it. It arrived safely packaged in protective bubble wrap and clear plastic. My desktop is 31 inches high so I wanted a chair that would rise a bit higher than my current. This chair does actually rise to 24 inches and works perfectly for me. The material feels like leather and the arm rests are soft with about 1/2\" of padding. The lift mechanism is smooth and quiet. The chair is very comfortable to sit in! The first time I sat down, I noticed the lumbar support pressing firmly against my back. It was very noticeable but after using the chair for over two weeks, I finding it is very comfortable and I feel it promotes better posture. My old chair had a pronounced backward lean and I much prefer this new chair. I also appreciate that the arms fold up and out of the way when desired. Assembly took me about 30 minutes and the directions were excellent with well written instructions, detailed illustrations and a parts list. The parts were labeled in a sealed package. While this chair is indicated as \"big and tall\", I am 5'9\" and weigh 185 lbs. and I wouldn't want it to be any smaller. I am very impressed by the quality of this chair and would highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed!",

As others have noted it lacks adjustments other than up & down. Supposedly you can adjust rocking tension, but I couldn't tell much difference.It has a good size seat. I can comfortably sit cross-legged. The material feels like it will hold up well. Overall I'm happy with it.",

Definitely not the chair for me. The chair looks nice and for a small/narrower person it might work ok. Not sure why it's being marketed to larger/heavier people. Very disappointing! I fully intend to return the chair. UPDATE: The company is willing to refund my money and I appreciate that, very much. As I said, for a narrow person this chair will probably work fine.",

It has a sleek and sophisticated look with its black leather upholstery. The padding on the seat and backrest provides great support for long hours of sitting. However, it doesn't have a tilt lock feature, which would have been a nice addition.Despite that, the chair's ergonomic design promotes good posture and reduces the risk of backaches. It can be easily adjusted to the desired height and has a 360-degree swivel feature for easy mobility. Overall, it's a durable and stylish chair that offers excellent comfort, although it lacks a tilt lock.",
