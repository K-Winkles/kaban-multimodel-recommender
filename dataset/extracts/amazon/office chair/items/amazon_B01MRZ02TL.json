                "reviewText": "My daughter needed a new chair and this is what she picked out. Overall I\u2019m glad she picked this one out. For one the price was right and the quality is better than the others we have had. First, it came well packaged and after laying out all the parts the assembly was quick and the instructions were clear. The chair itself is made with quality materials and will last a long time with normal use. The chair is comfortable and the pillows are a nice addition. My final thought is that you can\u2019t go wrong with this chair as the price and quality are two important factors that make it good choice.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second one of these. The first I've had for five or six years and it's pretty rough. The fabric is now coming apart on the seat cushion and more worryingly, the bolts that hold the armrests on have broken. Yes, that's right, broken. The heads break off. I'm not a heavy guy either. Speaking of which, the cushioning in this is fairly firm but good and the seat fits me we well as a smaller person. The cushions provided do help with support and in the end, I find this chair to be very comfortable especially considering the price.Back to the bolts; this has to be the worst part of the chair. They were coming loose on the armrests on my prior chair, then eventually failed at the bolt head. I see there is loctite applied from the factory on this new one; I don't remember if the old one had that and if not, it will help. However, while I was putting together the new chair using an impact driver on the lowest setting (~15 lb/ft), I managed to break one of the bolts at the head. These are clearly weak bolts and they should never snap this way, especially considering their size. In fact, the small Phillips head screws used to secure the plastic trim seem more stout. If you're careful with the bolts and expect to replace the chair in 3 years or so, I think this is a good buy.",

                "reviewText": "This chair is quite soft and very comfortable.Positives *Cushion is soft, leathery feel. Adjustable height, and you can add the lumbar/head pillow rest if you desire. *Colours are AMAZING. I ordered the Green and Black, absolutely loving how they pop and add to the set up I have.Negatives *Quite heavy (around 60 lbs?) when it is in the box, I live alone and even though I chose to have it delivered to my back porch (for safety, and also to make it easier for me to slide into the house) FedEx still disregarded my delivery instructions and put it on my front porch. I had to struggle getting it from the front to the back of the house but I managed. Just be cautious if you don't have anyone to help you move the box to begin, it is cumbersome. * I'm not the smartest person but I assumed I could put together a chair. I was -wrong-. Please, please, please find the instructions faster than I did. They are put in with the cushions, so make sure to open everything and lay it out. My biggest complaint was how hard everything was to put together but that is just me not being handy and thinking I can do things myself. I ended up getting it all put together (and correctly it seems!) but it did take about two hours. The instructions are clear up until a point, and the QR Code for the Video in the instructions doesn't take you to the video, just to the companies YouTube where you have to actually find the video instructions you're looking for. All said, I wish it was the instructions had been in their own individual package or just placed in the box instead of in a random area not knowing they are there. If you're handy, you'll be able to build this thing no problem, but if you're not make sure you just read through everything slowly and you'll be able to get it built. It might take two hours like me but you got this!!Overall, I love the chair and I am so glad I bought it. If you're looking for a soft, comfortable chair that you can adjust to your needs, I don't think you can do much better than this.",

They are not designed for office work or even long hours of gaming, really. They are designed for one thing and one thing only, and that thing is to Look Fun.Mega-comfy office chairs just don't exist in fun colours! Black and grey is so boring!! This chair consistently makes me a little bit happier every time I walk into my room because haha bright pink. The neck and lumbar pillows? Fun, but useless. The cushion? Could absolutely be cushier. Have I regretting spending so much money on it yet? Nope!People complain about these being hard to build too, which on one hand is fair because the instructions are very vague, but I built this sucker by myself in an hour three days after major abdominal surgery, so I think you'll be fine.",
