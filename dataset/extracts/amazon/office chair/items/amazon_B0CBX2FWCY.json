In a word, amazing!I normally don\u2019t buy chairs from the internet as it is something you should try before you buy to be sure it will be comfortable and practical for you. Since most of my leather chairs end up peeling and teared with time, I decided to try this new one, especially because of the adjustable seat position. I have long legs and it would be great to have better thigh support so I took a leap of faith and went for it knowing that I could return it even with some trouble to repack it.To my surprise the chair arrived, and quality seemed very good. The finish was good, all parts matched ok and was a breeze to assemble (it come even with a spare screw card) and also \u2013 almost \u2013 comfortable. The issue preventing it to be perfect is that it is a little too high for me even adjusted to their minimum height.Pleased with the quality of the chair and all it\u2019s adjustment but one (height) I wrote to the company, not to complain but to suggest that they increase the range of the height adjustment to make it perfect.To my surprise, the same day, in a matter of hours, I received a message from the company acknowledging the receipt of my suggestion and saying that they do have a shorter column and they would send it to me immediately, free of charge. And they did it\u2026 Four days after the new column was delivered to me and I tried to assemble it. Easy said than done as I\u2019m a heavy 6.2 guy and gravity has made impossible to separate the top of the column from the mechanism of the chair.Again I wrote to the company, not to complain, but to suggest that they change the junction of the mechanism to the top column to be held by a screw and bearing to make it possible to change the column if needed. To my surprise \u2013 again \u2013 they offered to send me a new mechanism to use with the shorter column, free of charge.Since the issue was \u2013 since the beginning - not their fault, I said it wouldn\u2019t be fair with the company to bear all the cost, and offered to share the part and shipping and their answer was \u201cThank you but NO \u2013 we are most interested in our customer\u2019s satisfaction\u201d.Impossible not to write a positive review for a company with this customer service. We must praise it hoping that others can mirror them in our benefit.As for the chair, after changing the column, it is great: with all the seat, back and arms adjustment it is easy to find the sweet spot for my height and quality, so far, has been great, everything working well and easy to adjust. Let\u2019s see how it will age, I will do an update in a couple of months regarding how it is wearing off.PS: I do not have any link to the company nor I was compensated in any manner to write this review other than receiving a great customer support.",

                "reviewText": "I'm always skeptical about buying from brands I've never used before. I was pleasantly surprised by this purchase. I've had the chair now about three months. It's held up beautifully. It's a good quality product for the money. It's given me no problems at all. It is comfortable. It doesn't give me any aches and pains like the previous chair did. It rolls smooth and feels stable.It arrived with TWO sets of hardware, which was fantastic. No worrying about missing parts. Assembly was straightforward and simple. I decided to try the lumbar support pillow. The manufacturer sent it right away as they promised they would. The pillow is much better quality than I expected.Bottom line, I would buy this chair again in a heartbeat. I highly recommend it to anyone who spends a lot of time at a desk or in front of a computer. It's given me great support and zero problems.UPDATE: 06/22/22After using it for six months, I bought a second one for my home computer. The first was for my work office. They provided the same great service on the second chair also. Two sets of hardware. Easy to understand instructions. The scond chair took me about 30 minutes to unbox and put together. The box that they ship in is double the thickness of regular boxes. Parts and pieces are wrapped very well. The hardware even comes with a blue dab of thread lock on it to make sure the screws don't back out.Their customer service is what some American companies used to be. They are excellent in every way. Before you get the chair, they send you an email saying it is about to arrive and give you instructions on what to do if there is a problem. They still offer a free lumbar pillow as well. No strings attached! They even send follow-ups, not to sell you anything, but to make sure you are completely satisfied.As you put the chair together, you'll notice that it was manufactured with detail in mind. All the holes line up. Everything works as it should or better. No broken or missing parts. Not even a scratch. I really can't recommend these folks enough! I am STILL completely satisfied after two purchases about six months apart.",
