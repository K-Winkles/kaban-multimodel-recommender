                "reviewText": "I just received this chair and assembled it so I can't yet address long term durability, but my first impression is it's a great value for the price I paid for it ($109 with shipping included - some chairs charge extra for shipping). My old office chair is still holding up and working as it should but the seat has grown hard and uncomfortable so I had been looking at a new chair and comparing prices for a while. This chair's features and price made me take a chance and order one.It arrived early, the assembly instructions were clear, all parts were present, and it went together well with one minor exception. I put it together myself in about 30 minutes without any big problems, and this is how I managed the couple of steps where a second set of hands and/or eyes would have been momentarily helpful (but not absolutely necessary). The holes for the bolts that connect the seat back to the arms can be challenging to get started because it's difficult to see if they're lined up. It turned out the material around the bolt receptacle was the problem. I recommend making sure the material is tucked in tightly around the bolt receptacle so it's not interfering with the bolt getting started. Also, lay the chair on its side (on a pad or carpet) so gravity isn't working against you, and then put just enough gentle, downward pressure on the arm to allow the threads on the first (of two on each side) arm-to-seat-back bolt to start to engage. Now that I put this chair together and know the tricks I could build subsequent ones like a NASCAR pit stop.Finally, the silver plastic buttons that are supposed to hide the bolts in the arms are pretty useless. I knew as soon as I put them in that they were too loose and would not stay in place, and they didn't. They started falling out almost immediately. They don't snap into place and there's really nothing to hold them in. I took them all back out and for now will do without them. If it bothers me enough I'll find a mild glue to hold them in. I wouldn't recommend super gluing them in, just in case you ever need to access the bolts underneath.I've ordered a couple of things recently that I've had to assemble and I'm liking the recent trend with assembly instructions and parts. As opposed to up until the recent past with \"some assembly required\" items that came with jumbled bags of mostly unlabeled parts and hardware, some of which was missing but not obvious until the item was half assembled, this chair came with all needed hardware on a plastic-covered bubble card with the groups of hardware labeled with numbers that correspond to the instructions. Also on the card is the only tool you'll need, a very handy T-handle Allen wrench. There is a parts inventory on the first page and you can easily lay out the parts and know that everything is there before starting the assembly, The instructions are easy to follow and are drawings with labeled hardware and parts. There's no confusing text instructions written by someone for whom English is apparently not their first language.My only question at this point is how well it will hold up, not only the mechanism but the material. It's a very nice, soft, fake leather, but in my experience with so-called \"bonded leather\" or whatever euphemism they happen to use for it, it can seem very nice when it's new, but it soon turns brittle and the top layer starts flaking off. I hope that doesn't happen with this chair, but the reasonable price vs. features made it worth taking a chance. I will edit this review later if the chair does not stand up well to daily use.",

                "reviewText": "So I'm a little skeptical with any desk chairs I buy lately due to the fact that I've had two chairs break down on me in 2years, I'm 5'9\" 245lbs. To start my chair arrived earlier than expected 04/07/21, which I thought was pretty cool (even if FedEx was a duche bag and didn't bother to put it near my door but rather at the end of my walkway, thank goodness I have decent neighbors). That being said this is one of the better made chairs I've found; it's got a metal base and I really appreciated the fact that all of the holes aligned when I was putting the chair together; it really took maybe 30 - 45min for me to put it together no longer. I like the massage feature but I honestly could take it or leave it; it's less of a massage and more of a vibration, but it doesn't add or take away from the chair for me. I do find it very comfortable as sometimes I find myself sitting at my desk for several hours with either work or gaming. Truth be told I don't think I'll EVER buy a desk chair again that has the word 'gaming' in it because their all crap; this chair is sturdy, well made and comfortable. The only part of the chair I swapped out were the wheels, because I have carpet and those wheels always break on carpet I went for roller wheels instead and it was a good investment in my situation. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01G643EU6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 these are the wheels that I ordered to replace the one's that come with the chair for anyone that is interested.",

I did buy a lumbar cushion for my back It does take two people to put together as some of the pieces can be cumbersome with only one person. It is hard to screw the pieces together and hold them in place at the same time. It does not have built-in lumbar cushion so you should get one if you need it for sitting. There are ones you can buy that slip over the back of a chair. Those are the only cons I have right now. I will update if things go south.",
