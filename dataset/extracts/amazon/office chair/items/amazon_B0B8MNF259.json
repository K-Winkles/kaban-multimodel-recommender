                "reviewText": "Assembly: 5/5 I was able to assemble by myself with just a little maneuvering, adding the back of the chair took 2 tried since the first the screws were not alighted right and THIS created a creaking sound when I sat. After adjusting and taking more care the sound is gone and screws are flush in place.Feel of chair: 4/5 the height is higher than expected which is great for my desk. It is really wide but I would say if you are over 5\u20197 and plus size you might not be able to fully cross cross your legs but you can wrap one leg under you (my preferred seating). People note the back rest is low, I find it to still be very comfortable and provide support. But yes it hits mid back not full back.Functions: 4/5 it rises falls and swivels great! However, I am not sure if my tension is broken but it does not work and there is barely a tilt in the chair. After many tries and some stronger friends help the tension cannot be adjusted. This losses a star because I would have preferred a fully functional chair. And it\u2019s nice to be able to lean back.A note: this chair has no creaking noises as others have noted. Perhaps it\u2019s because my tilt function is not working that I do not have the creaking noise but I find it a very smooth and quiet chair.",

I have the chair on a cute rug and it looks beautiful in my home. :)",

It\u2019s like an old restaurant chair and needs some napkins under the feet. It\u2019s significant enough that you feel a lean.The lid to the gas canister as well was broken so I\u2019m afraid the canister itself won\u2019t be good for long either since the instructions said to remove the lid carefully and mine was broken almost in half and fell off by itself. (EDIT the canister is leaking fluid and bangs when you sit or stand. I\u2019ll have to pack it up and return it and that makes me sad. I really do like all the good parts)I really want this chair so hopefully I can contact the seller for a new base. Sitting cross legged makes me so happy and the fabric and quality of the chair seems awesome otherwise!UPDATE: the chair was not perfect but the customer service was!
