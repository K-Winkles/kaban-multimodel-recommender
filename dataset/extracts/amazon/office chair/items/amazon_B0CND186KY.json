This chair I just purchased I don't think it needs the mat, just my own opinion. And the base cushion is so comfortable, it's firm and thick, the back support also give me the support I need. 100% love it. I use this chair in kitchen because I cook three meals a day and spend lot of time in the kitchen standing. Finally something comfortable for my legs and back!",

                "reviewText": "I've put together a few of these chairs that have varied in style slightly. I've definitely put together and used chairs more expensive than this and not as good. The hardware for the chair was more heavey duty than the others. The arm rests are comfortable and adjustable in height! They're molded for your forearm and made of a softer rubber like material and not just some hard plastic. The seat is soft enough and the back reclines to a much lower level than I've seen before. It makes it nice for putting my feet up on the desk, leaning back and watching a movie on my screen when I should be working. This is a great chair at a very reasonable price.The one thing keeping it from a perfect 5 is that the back piece had a tear in the fabric around the plastic framing. Does it effect the chairs funcioning? No, but it does reduce the lifespan. I contacted customer service and they told me they wouldn't have any replacement pieces for a month. :(",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice upgrade from my previous office chair. I put this in my home office and sit on it for a full work day without discomfort.The seat cushion is solid yet soft. The lumbar support does take a little bit of getting used to if you haven't had a chair with one before but it is helping my posture and seated position. The armrests move up and down, they don't swivel but I\u2019ve only ever had 1 chair where the pads could rotate so I don't expect that anymore.The high back and headrest are made from a mesh material, the weave is thick so at first glance it looks solid. One spot on the fabric was a little worn through from the box, it doesn't seem to be frayed just like a little hole where I can see the white of the frame through it. It\u2019s in a spot that isn't noticeable and it doesn't seem to be getting worse so hopefully it won't fray more with time. The back frame seems to be plastic but is heavy duty and when I lean all the way back it doesn't have any give or creaks. By default the tension came quite loose and the chair would lean back quickly but there is a knob on the bottom that you can twist to tighten it up and select a tension that better suits you.Assembly is quick and easy, took me about 20 minutes. There is one step when it helps to have another person hold the pieces together while you line up the screws but one person can assemble this.All in all I\u2019m quite happy with this chair but I\u2019ll update this review if that changes.",
