                "reviewText": "Sat on this for 2 weeks to get a good feel on how comfortable it is. Overall an excellent office chair - the seat cushion is thick and I could sit on it for hours, it tilts back and the head rest is great when leaning back... adjusts for different heights (caters to tall people too, or you could just take it off if you're shorter). The armrests are also adjustable, although I do wish they were positioned a bit more towards the back as I found my elbows hanging off them a bit. The one thing I couldn't test was the lumbar support as the knob on the back fell off during assembly, and the position of my backrest does not provide any. Nothing a back cushion can't fix. Customer support offered to send me a new chair but I decided to just keep this one to avoid the hassle. Assembly was easy and I assembled it myself in 20 minutes with the included instructions, no extra tools required. The chair is heavy, sturdy and was packaged well. Overall, I would recommend this chair to people looking for a reliable affordable and comfortable office chair. Sidenote: the tilt function is adjusted by turning the knob under the chair (this wasn't on the instruction manual).",

I put my own weight on it(not trying to break it just my own weight) and the back did not give unless using the little lever. My own chair is more expensive and the back does not hold my weight, it gives easily. If I could buy this for me, I would. But im 6\u20191 and 360lbs so is not gonna last with me.Ps: the headrest on top is really neat. I thought that was not necessary since Im a gamer and we never have are back fully on the back of the chair.. but if you use it properly, you\u2019re gonna love the headrest",

The replacement was send very quickly (at no charge ) after I returned the 1st one ( no charge) that was damaged.1sr review:It looks very nice, study and it is well packaged. It is also comfortable with several adjustments possible. I still have some doubts with the quality and how it will age because i have had several problems.The first chair I ordered had the lumbar support broken so I returned it and I got the 2nd one very quickly after initiating the 1st one return. Good.The assembly of the second one was not as easy: the documentation is missing step 6 ( no page missing, just jumping from step 5 to 6), one of the screw was bad (it looked different and was not working) but there are spares so it worked well in the end.There is no information about how to allow for tilt: It does not at first, one has to pull the height adjustment lever out to allow it.I saw this on the video for another brand!!!All in all it seems ok but all these incidents give me some doubts\u2026 I prefer to wait a little before giving it a 5*",

However, if you have a power drill with screw bits it'll definitely help with the build, as there is a lot of screwing (get you head out of the gutter).Any who, after setting it up the chair it self felt pretty sturdy and comfortable. I've had it for a while now and so far it's held up pretty good.Would definitely recommend.",
