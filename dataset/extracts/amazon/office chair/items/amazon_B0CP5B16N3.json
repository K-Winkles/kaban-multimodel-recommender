                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable, Sturdy, BIG Office Chair",
                "reviewText": "The chair comes carefully packaged, all pieces itemized in the enclosed instruction guide, and includes the necessary hardware and a T-handle wrench for assembly.The arms are nice and strong; they don't adjust up/down, but their location is comfortable and your arm position feels natural resting on them. One thing I liked immediately is that there is a curved plastic part of the arm that extends slightly below and in front of the padded arms that acts as a bumper to keep the arms from sliding under the desk. the old chair didn't have that feature, and the front of one arm is scraped because of that lack.The chair swivels and tilts (rocks), so you're not just in a static sitting position. The casters roll easily (on carpet, not sure about hard surface floors) and the base feels well built and solid.Total time from unboxing to complete assembly took about 50 minutes, with the last 25 minutes of that attaching the seat back. Up to that point, assembly can easily be performed by one person. The seat back is attached in two steps, with the first step tilting it in toward the front of the chair and placing two screws at the lower position, then moving it back and placing the last two screws at the top position. The weight of the seat back and the slipperiness of the material makes it very difficult to get a good steady purchase to place the screws. It can be done by one person (I did it, with much frustration and much colorful commentary, so glad I was alone!), but two people would be beneficial when you reach that point.If you're not assembling the chair in the room it will be in, measure the doorway of the assembly room and the location room, as the chair is big and wide. we have narrow interior doors, and it was a struggle to get it though the den door (used for assembly as it had more open space) and the home office door. I've included a picture of the chair it's replacing next to this chair for size comparison - quite a difference!This doesn't seem like a $100 chair: it's big, well-constructed, comfortable, and feels like it will last for years. For the price, the features, and the quality, this is a big step up from the chair it replaces, and is a terrific buy.",

                "reviewText": "My old leather office chair has been great, but started to lose its shape. I was in the market for a new chair and wanted one that's more ergonomically designed. I liked the leather on my old chair and this one has PU leather which looks and feels quite convincing but with an approachable price tag. The quality of the materials is nice, and it's resistant to liquids and light scratches so far. The seat is very wide, which is mostly a plus, but where it's a negative is in that the version I got has stationary armrests which means that my arms have to be a little wider than my frame so it's not ergonomic for my shape. The chair moves nicely with a good lean and hydraulic lift/lower is smooth. The shape of the back feels good against my spine, with support but also cushion. So far, I have not experienced any pain or discomfort during my work days! So far, so good, and plenty happy with this chair.",

The rollers are very smooth, and the chair adjusts up and down and is able to \"rock\" back and forth.This leads me to the two things I don't really like too much about this chair. #1. Though the chair rocks back and forth, it would have been nice if the chair could actually recline (seat stays put but backrest leans back). #2. Adjustable armrests would have been nice.Overall, this is a comfortable and plush office chair. For typical office use, this chair is more than adequate. However, this chair would be five stars if it could recline and had adjustable armrests.",

                "reviewText": "This chair was way easier to assemble than I thought it would be. All the bolts fasten with 1 tool which is included, and every set of bolts is identified through clever packaging with little plastic windows, so all you have to do punch open the card behind each set required as you follow along in the instructions. The chair itself is cushiony and comfy. It raises up high to where I can't even touch my feet on the ground at full height, so it could be posed at a drafting table as well as a desk. I couldn't figure out the diagram regarding the backrest mobility, but the whole thing has a rocking motion when you push with your feet on the floor, and the seat smoothly tilts back. I've used a plain little office chair without armrests or headrest for years, so this is a big improvement. I saw in the instructions a recommendation to air out the chair for a day, but I did not notice ANY strong chemical scent from manufacturing. I put it to use immediately, without any issues at all. I just love it! Great chair.",

                "reviewText": "Nice and comfortable padded office chair. This thing has plush padding everywhere your body comes in contact with it. I like the lumbar bolster and arm rest padding. I personally would prefer a little less/thinner shoulder rest area. The wheels on the legs roll along just fine upon hard flooring as well as short carpeting. The adjustments allow for good flexibility for varying body types/weight and personal preferences.",

The install was very simple and straight forward and they also included an allen wrench \"T\" tool with a molded plastic handle......nice! The screws themselves are black with the tips being pre dipped in blue lock tight. It is not genuine leather but can't tell from the look and feel. Comfortable and well made. Very impressed and happy with it overall.",
