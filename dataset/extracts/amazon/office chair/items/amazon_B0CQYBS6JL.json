I didn\u2019t want a chair with arms and did not want one that was made of a type of fabric that she would ruin. She is 9 and not the tidiest child. I compared prices and eventually ended up buying this one. I was not disappointed. It is sturdy and easy to clean. It fits perfectly at her desk and was easy to assemble.",
