                "reviewText": "Buy this chair now! I'm doing to do my best to be as concise as possible and refrain from going on an endless rant about how much I love this chair.What I'm going to do instead is accurately and thoroughly review this marvel of modern engineering. First I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself. I'm a 6 foot tall 250 pound military member with previous surgery on L5S1 which has left me with nerve pain every day of my life as well as problems on three other levels of my spine. Generally chairs aren't designed to seat a person of my stature and won't last very long. I requirea chair that's very sturdy, adjustable and ergonomic.The box came, overjoyed I struggled to lift it into my apartment. The first thing I noticed was the weight of the box. It gave me a sense of assurance in knowing that I bought quality. The Hardware felt to be of good manufacturing. Also I received double the hardware necessary to assemble the chair. I LOVE EXTRA HARDWARE. The instructions were very well illustrated and the chair built in minutes. One thing that I really appreciated was the way adjustments were engineered into the design of the chair. While assembling you can adjust the width of the arm rests. Once the bolts are tightened down your arm rests will only adjust up and down. Another adjustment built into the chairs construction is controlling the distance from the seat to the back rest. This is generally only a feature on higher end chairs and I was happy to see that is has quite a bit of range.The roller blade wheels are amazing! My apartment has tile floor and my old terrible chair struggled to move anywhere, often getting tiny wheels stuck in the grooves of the tile. It generally made navigating chasms of my unorganized room clumsy and difficult. With these rollerblade wheels I can glide from one end of the room to the other. Its effortless, I love it.The mesh feels very comfortable and breathable. The lumbar support is amazing. I nearly fell asleep the moment I sat in this. The lever that allows the chair to tilt back or sit straight up is the kind of lever that you push down or pull up. This is very good because some other chairs have a lever that's essentially a bar that you slide horizontally. Over time the bar can work its way out so when you go to sit back in your chair the lever pops out and the char sends you flying backward. This has happened to me at least fifty or sixty times and I have ended up on the ground as a result of this. The design of the seat back lever of prevents this from happening.This chair is so comfortable that I felt the need to write this review as soon as I sat down. Already my back feels better, my nerve pain is reduced. I had been sitting on a broken chair for over a year and a half until I noticed the amount of discomfort I was ignoring and pulled the trigger on this. I will update this review if anything changes or the chair fails overtime.",

The rollerblade wheels make it easy to move around.I noticed the lift was sinking slowly in October 2023. Then it started sinking more quickly, to the point where if it was warm, I was lifting the chair several times an hour. I reached out to Duramont in early December 2023 and they asked me a few questions about disassembling the base, then promptly shipped replacement parts. I was able to replace the lift and now my chair is like new, except the cushion is molded to my butt.Duramont's chair is definitely worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "Bought one at the start of covid for my wife's WFH set up. Thought I'd be bringing it down to my studio after a few months when it was over, fast forward 4 years and still has that WFH... as everyone knows.But, my studio chair was toast, so I tried a Costco LaZBoy chair that was horrendously uncomfortable, and then decided to get another of these. My wife's chair has held up over these years and is still comfortable, so I got one for myself. It is comfortable! The lumbar support offers a variety of adjustments and doesn't hurt. It rolls well. The head rest has a lot of adjustments. The layback option is nice.I didn't install the arms, as I play guitar and those get in the way.My only complaint is the seat cushion, while it is comfortable, it does feel like it may way out over time and flatten. But there is good support there and the other chair is still great, so I'm not too concerned for longevity.Also, not a huge fan of the mesh-y material on the seat. Not always easy to clean sometimes with dust and things.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this chair a couple of months ago to replace a chair with broken hydraulics. At first, I didn't like the seat, because it felt stiffer than my prior chair, which was well-padded. However, now that I've had some time to get used to it, I decided to come back and give this chair five stars. First, it's solidly built, so it is sturdy on the floor and offers excellent support. Second, the lumbar support is excellent. Third, the adjustable headrest is perfect. This brings me to the best part of the chair. It easily and comfortably leans back with zero tipping. The headrest is in perfect spot for deep thoughts.The one negative might be the weight of the product when the box arrives. However, if you can manage that, you'll realize that the weight is important because it makes the base of the chair sit solidly in place. The base is metal, and the wheels are high quality rubber.I would buy this chair again. Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I had this chair delivered yesterday after spending a few weeks looking through several options on Amazon and on the web. In a nutshell, this chair is just as good as my office chair, which was specially ordered for me to address occupational health issues with my back. Indeed, I initially considered buying a chair like the one in my office but the price was nearly 6x over what the Duramont is on Amazon. The only difference being that the arm rests can't be adjusted in- or out-wards (but they can certainly be adjusted up or down). The materials and mechanism are visibly high quality, and all the nuts, bolts for assembly, including a handy tool and gloves, come in a cardboard pack. I assembled the product within 20 minutes. Having been through several chairs in my 50-years, I would definitely recommend this one, especially for users from a medium to large frame who like a sturdy, firm chair (I'm 6'2'' 82kg/12.9 st). I should also suggest, that if you're inclined to go for an option that is around \u00a3100 cheaper, do yourself a favour and invest in this one. To finalise, I have a small beef with the inclusion of a \"Scan to claim 10-year warranty\" card that asks to point your mobile phone to a QR code and \"Watch what happens\". What happens is that this triggers a script that launched my phone's text app with a code to be sent to a phone number in Nicaragua (country code 505). Because I'm mindful of personal data protection concerns, I will not be claiming my 10-year warranty, but I'm indeed confident the chair will at least last me 6 years (as the one I've just replaced did).",

The lumbar support is fantastic. We did have issues trying to separate the base from the gaslift. We had to return it with it attached.",

                "reviewText": "I tried to find a chair that was adjustable as much as it was possible. This one has them all with the exception of the sitting part tilt/placement (some chairs that i tried were cutting behind my legs after sitting longer). It goes up enough and if you are taller (I think they were mentioning 6.5 feet) it has enough space for the legs, also when you sitting, as a male, you can open your legs and be confortable because the arm rest are not in the way on the side. The lombar support can be adjusted for higher position and also for depth. The reclining part i try it but I will not use it too much during work (this is a chair for working) but it locks your preference which is neat. The roller blade wheels are good and slides well but sometimes they lock on the side and you need to jigle a little to make it get out of that position. Also not a big problem. I had a surpirse for a flyer with a QR code and after an exchange on sms got a text indicating that i got more warranty then the 5 years promoted. I save the info to have it for the future (which I suggest) because I'm sure in some years I'll not have that sms anymore. I review in the future to let you know how it will keep over the time.",

                "reviewText": "I recently had to start working from home and have been using my 5 year old 99 dollar office chair. It did the job, but just barely. After working at the desk everyday for a few weeks, I started having hip pains and my wife said \"Just buy a nice new chair!!!\"So after some research and shopping around, this was the one I decided to go with.All I can say is what an amazing chair this is and it's SO comfortable!!! The very first thing I noticed was the firmness of the seat cushion. I feel like I'm sitting ON it instead of my other chair where I was sinking IN it. It's so firm and comfortable and keeps me in a solid upright position.The back is extremely comfortable and the second thing I noticed was the excellent lumbar support. It's firm and you can feel it, but it doesn't stick out too much to make it uncomfortable. It's quite amazing actually.The wheels are solid and rolls so smoothly on the floor. The armrests are comfortable and adjustable up and down. As with other office chairs, it can be raised and lowered and the back can tilt to your preference.I honestly can't say one single bad thing about this chair and the level of comfort is mind blowing. My hip pain has already gotten better and I really feel like it helps me sit up in a good straight position.I never realized that investing in a quality chair would be so beneficial! If you're in the market for one for working at home, I can't recommend this one highly enough!",
