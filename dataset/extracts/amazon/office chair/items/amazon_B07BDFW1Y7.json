                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Option for a Budget Chair - Love the Adjustability",
                "reviewText": "I've had this chair for a couple weeks now and am pretty happy with it. I was using a hand-me-down gaming chair that was super cheap, falling apart and starting to hurt my back. Instead of getting another gaming chair, which I feel like are mostly for looks and don't really provide any support, I wanted an ergonomic one, but didn't have several hundred dollars to a grand to throw at a really nice brand name chair. This is the only chair I found that fit both my budget and my criteria: all mesh, adjustable lumbar, included adjustable headrest, tilt tension control, and adjustable armrests. For reference, I'm 5'4, 120 lbs, and this chair fits me really comfortably.I like the lumbar on the most shallow setting--it's just enough support without being obtrusive, and I'm really glad you can adjust the height. I love being able to adjust the seat tilt and tension as well, since I'm super active in my chair and like to rock back and forth at my desk and lean back for breaks. I sit at my desk all day for work, and after work I stay there and game, so I needed a chair that would recline and be good for lounging too (also why the headrest was so important).There is hard plastic on the edges of the seat and backrest, but it doesn't really bother me. I like to be an \"ergonomic rebel\" and sit cross-legged a lot, and I don't find that the edges of the seat hurt my legs. Although I'm on the shorter side, so your mileage may vary if you're taller and like to sit with your legs curled up.The mesh feels firm and has enough give to be comfortable while providing support and breathing. Again, I'm on the smaller side so I don't think the mesh sagging will be too much of an issue for me personally. I actually really like the headrest--it fits in the curve of my neck comfortably, and even though you can't move it forward or back, I feel like being able to tilt up and down and change the height makes up for it.You'll definitely want to take time to play around with the adjustability and find the right fit for you. The only other thing I would have liked is the ability to move the arms in and out horizontally (I like to have the arm rests really close to me, but if you need them to be wider it looks like you can move them farther apart when assembling), but I wasn't expecting to find that in a $200 chair, and I'm just glad I can adjust the arm rests forwards backwards, up, down, and rotate them. I use that functionality a lot, so it works great for my needs. The arm rests themselves are made of a pretty hard rubber but have some slight give, so not just rock-hard plastic. If you need the arm rests to be cushy you can probably get covers for them.Assembly was pretty straightforward, but I followed their video as well just to make sure I did it right. Some of the castors required extra force to attach, but felt solid once they were in. Haven't had any issues with squeaking or creaking yet--still feels pretty sturdy (and I sit in it for 10+ hours a day). I did check all the pieces for scuffs, dents, or tears before assembling, but everything was in good condition. I'd read great reviews about SIHOO's customer support beforehand though so I wasn't worried in the case I did need to replace anything.Overall, if you want a chair that has ergonomic features and adjustability, and doesn't break the bank, I'd recommend this one. I did weeks of research before deciding on it and I'm pretty happy with my decision, especially for the price! In the future when I have a thousand dollars to invest in a Herman Miller or Haworth I'll probably upgrade, but I'm more than happy with this chair in the meantime.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Not suitable for Plus size people",
                "reviewText": "Just got this chair today, assembly is very easy and the parts are very robust, most of this chair feels high quality except the plastic paddle on the lever that adjusts the height and locks & unlocks the reclining function and the headrest attaches to the back of the chair. That part is a bit cheap feeling but as long as you don't have someone jokingly pull the chair back by the headrest it shouldn't be a problem, but if some joker wants to pull on it to scare you, it could break eventually. As to the long term comfort, right now I can not attest to that yet. But what I can tell you is that this chair is not meant for very wide people with a very large rear-ends. The chair is narrow, I am a small guy 5'5\" 150lbs and this chair is just the right size for me. THE HEADREST at its lowest setting and tilted all the way back is just the right place for it to rest just under the back of my skull and just above me shoulders just they way those U shaped travel neck pillows rest around you neck to give the back of your neck support when you are traveling. So if you are shorter, it wont rest there most likely. That's where I like it to be but you may differ, but what I can tell you is that if you don't rest it there it will force your head forward because it doesn't move back any farther, which I don't like. THE LUMBAR SUPPORT is okay, this chair allows you the screw it in as far as you like and for me its in the right place, but as far as it goes I've never had a chair with this so it takes some getting used to, but you an just unscrew it so you cant feel it, but I want to be in a proper ergo so I will just get used to it. THE ADJUSTABLE HEIGHT is good for me as a short guy many office chairs don't adjust low enough, and even though I can put my feet flat on the ground for most of them, the weight of the backs of my legs are entirely being held by the chairs seat instead of letting me reduce pressure on the back of my legs with my feet allowing my knees to be at an 80 degree angle instead of a hard 90 degree angle putting unneeded pressure on my hamstrings. I am using it while writing this review and it is currently at the lowest setting and it is perfect for me, so if you are shorter then me take that into account. As well be careful with the lever that adjusts the height because it is one of the only things that I can see breaking if you are not mindful. THE BACK REST is very comfortable because for me at least it has a high back and is just broad enough in the shoulders and for a small guy I have broad shoulders. I have a different mesh chair with a short back and the metal frame that holds the mesh on that chair constantly digs into my back and I cant bare sitting in it for very long but it was free so beggars cant be choosers. There is nothing able to do that on this chair for my body size and I appreciate that very much. THE SEAT is fully mesh with a cushion under the knees and seems to be comfortable as of right now, as I said long term comfort is still to be decided. But at first feel, I can say as long as you keep your legs facing forward I don't foresee a problem. But when I decided to buy a fully mesh chair I realized one of my favorite ways to sit will no longer be possible. I like to Spread my legs and have my right leg off the side of the chair instead of the front. With mesh chairs, because of their nature, they are elevated on the sides similar to a bucket seat chair, but there are no cushions so it will surely cut off circulation so this is a no go. This is something I knew going into this purchase and decided it was worth a try and I can just get used to it. Another position I like is to sit in my chair cross legged. This is still possible but not the most comfortable because the bucket shape isn't as comfortable for my feet. The comfort of the seat is probably the most important part of this chair for me. I will be sitting in it every day for very long periods of time and I need something that wont fatigue my butt, tailbone and the back of my legs, if this mesh seat creates pressure points and I begin to get sore, I will try and update this review, and I will probably return the chair and look for a regular cushion chair or buy the regular cushion style of this chair because they make one with a plush cushion as well. Hope this cleared something up for some of you.",

                "reviewText": "Like I said this chair is great in comfort and really shines best with a nice set of caster wheels added to give it the high quality feel and smooth rolling. That said, some things I wish I knew before purchasing.Gloves are included with the kit to build the chair and I highly recommend using them. The machine finish on the Allen key was so rough I got metal fragment splinters in my finger and it stung for the next 24 hours at the location when any form of pressure occurred. PUT ON THE GLOVES FIRST BEFORE BUILDING THE CHAIR.The chair does recline back more than enough though the part that I was slightly dissatisfied with was the locking points of this reclining feature. There are only 3. All the way forward halfway back (which I use most) and full back to a resting position which is more ideal for napping or media viewing. THERE ARE ONLY 3 LOCKING POINTS ON THE RECLINER I WISH THERE WAS MORE FOR BETTER ADJUSTABILITY.Finally, I am a 5\u201911\u201d man that has completely maxed out the tilt and height adjuster for the headrest on this chair. If you are any taller then this do not buy this chair. I only wish I had 1-2 click for the height and it would be a chair perfectly built for my body structure. I also wish the degree or rotation for the tilt would go further back for my noggin to lay it back farther sometimes but it does the just when I\u2019m active at the computer. HEADREST HAS MINIMUM ADJUSTABILITY AND DOESN\u2019T SUPPORT ANYONE 6\u2019 OR TALLER.Final notes:Armrests = good and adjust a little too easy imoLooks = premium and luxuriousInstructions = clear though screw labeling could use workBreathability: like a charm nice and coolFINAL REVIEW4/5 Stars",

                "reviewText": "Ich habe den Stuhl vor knapp 2 Jahren gekauft und seitdem befindet er sich bei mir im Dauereinsatz (Home-Office und privat). Der Stuhl machte von Beginn an einen robusten und wertigen Eindruck und lie\u00df sich mit dem gelieferten Werkzeug und der beiliegenden Anleitung schnell und unkompliziert montieren. Einen unangenehmen Geruch konnte ich damals nicht feststellen. Insgesamt muss ich sagen, dass das Sitzen auch nach mehreren Stunden immer angenehm war. Der Kippmechanismus der R\u00fcckenlehne l\u00e4sst sich individuell einstellen und erm\u00f6glicht die n\u00f6tige Flexibilit\u00e4t beim Sitzen. Insgesamt hatte ich den Eindruck, dass der Stuhl meinem R\u00fccken gutgetan hat.Bis heute klappert und quietscht nichts an dem Stuhl, allerdings gab es dann kurz vor Ablauf der Garantie Probleme mit der Fixierung der R\u00fcckenlehne. Nach kurzer Pr\u00fcfung stellte sich heraus, dass die beiden in der Sitzmechanik verbauten Kunststoffdurchf\u00fchrungen angebrochen waren und die R\u00fcckenlehne daher keinen stabilen Halt mehr hatte. Aus meiner Sicht ein klarer Grund f\u00fcr eine Abwertung.Ich habe den Defekt direkt beim Hersteller reklamiert, und schon nach wenigen Stunden erhielt ich R\u00fcckmeldung und die Zusicherung, schnellstm\u00f6glich ein Ersatzteil (neue Sitzmechanik) zu bekommen. Als dieses dann bei mir eintraf, stellte ich fest, dass die beiden Kunststoffdurchf\u00fchrungen (die Schwachstelle in meinem Stuhl) mittlerweile durch deutlich st\u00e4rkere Ausf\u00fchrungen ersetzt wurden. Dann aber das n\u00e4chste Problem: Durch die lange Nutzung waren alle Teile des Stuhls derma\u00dfen verkeilt, dass ich die alte Sitzmechanik nicht von der Gasdruckfeder l\u00f6sen konnte. Auch hier kam prompt Unterst\u00fctzung vom Hersteller mit genauen Anleitungen zur Demontage \u2013 zwar auf Chinesisch, aber durch Bild und Video gut verst\u00e4ndlich. Leider waren meine Versuche weiterhin erfolglos (bzw. h\u00e4tten den Stuhl v\u00f6llig zerst\u00f6rt). Letztendlich erkl\u00e4rte sich der Hersteller in meinem Fall dann aber bereit, mir einen neuen Stuhl zuzusenden. Dieser ist inzwischen aufgebaut und wieder im (Dauer-)Einsatz.Fazit:- Das urspr\u00fcngliche Modell war bequem und wertig, allerdings mit der angegebenen Schwachstelle, also eigentlich Grund zur Abwertung.- Wenn ich aber den heute erh\u00e4ltlichen Stuhl bewerte, kann ich best\u00e4tigen, dass die Schwachstelle inzwischen beseitigt ist. Es bleibt ein komfortabler und r\u00fcckenschonender B\u00fcrostuhl in guter Qualit\u00e4t und mit passendem Preis-Leistungs-Verh\u00e4ltnis.- Zuletzt muss ich auch den Support loben, hier habe ich schon ganz andere Dinge erlebt. In meinem Fall wurde immer prompt und freundlich reagiert, die L\u00f6sungsvorschl\u00e4ge waren immer nachvollziehbar und verst\u00e4ndlich. Man geht auf den Kunden ein und nimmt sich Kritik offenbar zu Herzen (verbesserte Konstruktion).F\u00fcr das heute erh\u00e4ltliche Produkt daher klare Kaufempfehlung.",
