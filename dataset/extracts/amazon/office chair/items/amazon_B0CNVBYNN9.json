What it does have is a very, very tall seat, so as a woman who bought the chair so that the backrest would go all the way up behind my head, the background actually only goes to, the nape of my neck but the seat is actually so high that my feet can\u2019t reach the floor. This is the most uncomfortable chair I\u2019ve ever had and I am going to be looking for a chair that will fit me and giving this one to my husband. Neither of us would be able to use this chair as at a desk because it\u2019s seated up too high for us to reach the desk. And yes, this is set correctly, it\u2019s as low as it will go.",
