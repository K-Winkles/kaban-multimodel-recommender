                "reviewText": "This chair choice was difficult to make, so many models that all look similar! I wanted one with a firm seat, not thin foam leaving one sitting on the board/plastic frame, this delivered that! I wanted adjustable seat positioning, this has all the seat adjustments my 40-year-old chair had! I am 5 feet tall, and the height adjusts low so my feet can touch the floor, most chairs don't do that! It is adjustable so if my 6-foot husband wants to use it, it raises high for his leg length as well. The seat moves forwards or back further assisting in comfort for the legs of the one using the chair. When I want the armrests out of the way it is just a squeeze of the buttons and they drop down where it feels like an armless chair, perfect if doing seated exercises. The assembly of the chair was a piece of cake! There is a video here in the comments on this web page showing how to assemble. Assembly time on the video is roughly 3 minutes it isn't that simple, in reality, it assembles with six hex screws and took roughly 30 minutes. Watch the video before and maybe during assembly, it is simple to put together. It is perfect for my needs, can't imagine a better chair anywhere. It works smoothly on hydraulics for height adjustment, the back has the mesh which I was worried about and there was no need, it is amazing to have airflow through the mesh! It offers just as much support as the solid back chair gave! The addition of lumbar support is very welcoming on a tired back! If you are on the fence about this chair or the taller back one, I feel it is worth the little bit extra to have the lower back version. I would give this chair 10 stars if I could, it is that nice of a chair.",

                "reviewText": "My old chair finally bit the dust. It was a Eurotech and I paid around $400 for it. Nice, heavy, and sturdy.I couldn't spend that much on the new chair. I bought this Office Star ProGrid for one reason, the weight(chair weighs 48 pounds). It's been my experience the heavier the better.I'm about 6'2\", and about 250 pounds. This chair is very comfortable and has adjustable armrests which I appreciate. I believe it would be difficult the find a better quality chair for under $200(I paid $179 in July 2021). Easy to assemble.FYI, the chair looks a little crooked in the photo I provided. I assure you the chair is if fine. My building is old and the floor is a little uneven where the chair was sitting. The chair did not come with rubber wheels, I added those.",

The armrests are firm but not too hard. The seat cushion is exceptionally nice; firm, and springy but definitely soft enough for both short and long sessions.It has a little bit of wiggle in the seat, forward and back, and it clicks a little. Overall this is an excellent chair, but at this price, I feel like it should be more solidly built.The backrest is solid, the mesh firm and supportive. The adjustments you can make to the height is nice,I'm 6' and 210 lbs (1.83M, 95.25Kg) and this supports my back and rear nicely.",

                "reviewText": "I'm so glad this chair was on sale, and I took a chance and bought it. It turns out, this chair is perfect for me. It offers everything I wanted. It has a well padded seat cushion that's contoured so it's comfortable, yet firm enough and supportive for all day seating. It's capable of all the adjustments I need to create just the right seating positions for my body. I need to be able to customize everything because I spend so much time working in the chair. It can tilt forward and back, and I can lock the tilt position slightly forward so it's great when I need to open up my hip ergonomically for my lower back. I can also adjust the tilt tension if I want to be able to rock forward or back. I can independently raise both the seat and back support up and down, forward and back. The arm rests can raise and lower, and the width is also adjustable. The components feel solid, are great quality and heavy duty. The chair has a great weighted feel when you move it and doesn't topple over. All these features in a chair are just an incredible value. It does more than some of the more expensive chairs I've looked it. I loved my last chair so much that it lasted me over 15 years, I never thought I'd be able to find a replacement I'd like, but surprisingly, this one is better that my last chair.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for the Office Star pro-line II model #92893 manager's chair. I had high hopes when I opened the box. The parts looks like they belonged to a sturdy and comfortable chair. I found two problems when trying to assemble, though.The first was when trying to bolt the module that contains the adjustment levers to the bottom of the seat. Two of the six predrilled holes were directly under a lever. That made one of the bolts difficult and another nearly impossible to properly tighten. It didn't help that the allen tool provided was also poorly designed for the job - if the rod had been bent in a different place it would have been far more useful.The second problem was found when trying to connect the back of the chair to the seat. The single bolt that was to connect the back to the seat did not match the predrilled hole in the metal frame.I chose to return the chair rather than try to work around these issues.",

                "reviewText": "Amazon's pricing must be somewhat subjective as the price for this has changed ever few days, dropping down a little each time then a big jump back up. It is a great chair though! Lots of padding on the seat, adjustable in many ways and has some lumbar support but not a lot. For an office chair that could be sat in for 7-8 hours a day it is decent and if you can get it for less than $200 CAD then it is a good deal in my eyes! Some folks who are smaller might want it to come up higher, and some folks who are near or above the 250lb weight limit might want to consider getting a high lift / heavy duty piston too. Available at Amazon and much easier to install during initial assembly.",

                "reviewText": "The chair was easy to assemble. I'm not mechanically inclined, so if I could assemble it, anyone should be able to. It took me about 45 minutes. I didn't follow the instructions as it seemed to me assembling the seat bottom with controls was the logical place to start. Per the instructions its one of the last steps which makes me wonder how the chair would be positioned with the arms already installed. The only challenge was with the bolt under lever 3 was difficult to access. It will make sense if you assemble the chair, slide the seat forward using lever 3, and then tighten that bolt.I chose the mesh back chair over the comparable chair with padded back because I read the mesh naturally supports your back (it does) and I thought it would be cooler, especially in the summer months. The seat bottom is comfortable. It took me a couple of minutes to figure out how to adjust the seat tilt. Reading the instructions was the key to that problem :-)Now for the \"buts\". I am 5'8\" and I find the seat bottom really big (side to side and front to back). It's not a deal breaker for me. The arms adjust up and down but not side to side. Their position works well for me, but my husband is 6'1\" with an athletic build and he just barely squeezed in between the two arms. The seat back is adjustable up and down, but doesn't seem to lock in the \"up\" position. Again, not an issue for me because I prefer it down, but my husband would like it higher so would prefer it to lock.Overall I'm happy with the chair so far. I did a fair bit of research and the ergonomic office furniture stores in my area all carry this chair and highly recommend it. Their cost, however, was about $50 pre-tax more than Amazon plus Amazon delivered it to my door.",
