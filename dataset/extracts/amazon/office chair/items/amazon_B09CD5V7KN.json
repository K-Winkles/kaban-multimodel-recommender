                "reviewText": "Product works as advertised, keeps my favorite desk chair from sinking. Saved me from having to buy a new chair. I'm a little old lady and was able to successfully install in minutes. Just place the plastic piece around the cylinder shaft and tighten with hose clamps. So easy! As for the included screwdriver - it's cheap but does the trick. By the way, it's reversible, so can use for Phillips or flat head screws. My only complaint is that the plastic pieces are all the same size, which is 1-1/2 inches. To make my chair ideal height would have been about 4 inches, so 2 of them only gave me 3 inches and no way to use 3. Unless I wanted to saw it down, which I did not. No big deal, just used two. Can't speak to durability yet, but otherwise I'm pleased.",

To illustrate, the kit comes with a screw driver, but it's made of such cheap, soft metal that it slips on every other turn and is effectively useless (see photo of the worn-out tip). So you HAVE to use your own standard-quality phillips head to get this to work.Having said that, the kit DOES work (after all its just rubber and metal clamps), and it does seem like the cheapest solution to a broken office chair out there, so I feel like I have to give it 3 stars just for \"being there\"; I might have given it 4 stars on a different day.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Height wrong; Thin flimsy plastic; Hose clamps don't work",
                "reviewText": "Problem 1: The height of the three pieces added together was slightly too high to fit the length I needed, so my option was going to be to use only two pieces, which would leave my chair sitting lower than desired.Problem 2: The plastic pieces are extremely thin, and I was skeptical that one would provide a thick or sturdy enough foundation to hold another on top of it once the weight of a person was applied to the chair. I predicted the plastic would crack/break or the upper would slip off the lower. However, I never got to test it out due to the third problem....Problem 3: As many others have mentioned, the hose clamps are cheaply made. I did not understand what other reviewers meant by this until I received mine. The screws would not unscrew for removal. When wrapping the metal strip around and then trying to tuck it into the other end of the hose clamp in order to tighten it, the metal would not fit to tuck it in. I was unable to remove the screw in order to create space, and I was unable to fit the metal strip inside the space with the screw in place. I inspected it carefully, and the clamps were defective. I tried every trick in the book to remove the screws and/or to fit the end in without removing. I worked relentlessly with 4 clamps over 40 minutes, determined to make them work, and they just don't. I finally had to give up and return this product.I have instead now ordered an alternative similar product that has 3 varying height support pieces with substantial thickness for stacking. I plan to add some security by adding cable ties to them.",

It is like an old friend - comfortable & reliable... except when it lowers unexpectedly while I am working. Instead of spending the time and money buying another chair, I tried this. It works! (I know I sound like an infomercial!) I would be happy to buy it again if I have a similar \"sinking\" feeling with another chair.This review is not sponsored in any way. It is my honest opinion of a product I purchased.",

                "reviewText": "I hate it when a good idea is so poorly implemented. Manufacturer should come out with a deluxe version where they spend the time and money to source decent quality parts.It will work. Throw out the included screwdriver - you're not going to get the clamps open, or be able to close them, with the included tool. And when installing them, you'll need to squeeze the clamp then tighten the screw repeatedly - they bind up.",
