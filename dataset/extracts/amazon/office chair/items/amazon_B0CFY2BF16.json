The cushion is medium firm, is still comfortable and supportive three months later. I like the feel of the mesh, and the lumbar support. Being able to lift the armrests out of the way is very useful, depending on whether I need to move them out of the way for grooming a larger dog, or if they are in the grroming hammock I can rest my arms. The head rest does not work for me as it sits too far forward and pushes my spine out of alignment - I cannot sit up straight with it but at least it's removable.",

The lumber support works well for me who has frequent lumber pains.The padded seat cushion is soft and comfortable to sit on for a long period of time. Height adjustment is good but the arm rests cannot move, not a big problem though cuz they are pretty soft to lean your arm on. Head rest is great with a good amount of adjustment available.It took me less than 20 mins to assemble the chair, the instruction is clear and easy. Overall a good purchase and I\u2019m super happy with my new chair.",

This chair might be pink and seem cuter than its bulky brothers and sisters that are the opposite of cute. It is also poorly made and wildly uncomfortable. You can find something better, and your back will thank you.",

                "reviewText": "Overall this is a good chair. I do like the seat comfort. The lower back support is not adjustable but provides some support and is still comfortable. My primary concern is with the strength of the arm supports if you put a lot of your weight on the arm rests when either sitting down or standing up. It crackles a little and seems to strain under the weight but hasn't broken yet. I feel like I need to be careful with the arms for that. Otherwise, I'm enjoying the comfort of this chair.",

It does take some time to get it correctly, assembled following the included instructions. But it pays off in the end. it is super comfortable, it rolls smoothly and easily across the floor. The headrest feels good on the back of my head and I like that it has height adjustability as well.",

The assembly was straightforward, considering it only required tightening over a dozen screws. It was not a labor-intensive task.I have found it to be very comfortable and it supports my back well. It moves around smoothly. The mesh back keeps my back from getting too hot. It's really cost-effective to get a chair of this quality for around a hundred dollars. I would highly recommend.",
