                "reviewText": "I was in the market for a comfortable desk chair for my home office. I had a slightly higher budget but decided to go with this one due to the overall look, reviews, and functionality. I also needed something sturdy as I spend almost all of my day in my chair. Here is my review:Assembly: Comes with all the necessary tools and an easy instruction. I was a bit worried, but everything lined up perfectly and I finished within 30 minutes if not less, by myself. I kept the wrench tool to tighten the bolts every so often so I can use it longer - perhaps the reason why the chair feels really solid even with such heavy use.Comfort: The seat itself is super comfortable. It seems to be a mix of spring and foam, kind of like a sofa or a mattress. The back and arm is also cushioned well. I sit in it for hours without breaks and it is much more comfortable than my last chair which was supposed to be super \u201cergonomic\u201d. The armrest is great for my elbows but sometimes I do need to put it up to kind of lean closely into my desk/monitor to focus. Lastly, the wheels have been pretty smooth, both on my floor and floor mat.Quality: The leather is surprisingly higher quality than expected. It\u2019s durable and soft, definitely not the kind that would start disintegrating and flaking away. The overall craftmanship is quite great at this price point. The construction seems more than reasonable. I haven\u2019t had any issues with squeaking or wobbliness so far, which is great because I am on the bigger side and use this chair quite a lot.Overall a super comfortable chair at a very reasonable and fair price point. I would highly recommend this chair to anyone looking for a reliable office chair. I was in the market for a comfortable desk chair for my home office.

The color is a pretty cream, they are comfortable and we love that they swivel and rock a little.They can rip easily, plastic not leather so we are trying to be careful with them, but we think the chairs are a great price, look and offer comfort for the money.Easy enough to put together. We are very happy thus far.",

But have noticed that the foam on the arms wherw you rest your hands has flattened out in 2 months of very less use and I can now feel the hard iron when resting my arms. The foam inside seems very less and of low quality.",

                "reviewText": "Unlike most of the negative reviews I've read about this chair:1. The chair was not difficult to assemble and all parts fit together well using the step by step instructions provided.2. The casters that came with the chair roll as well as any chair I've owned. I had no difficulty rolling the chair from my living room, down the hall, and into my home office.3. The chair will lean back with an adjustment, but is a bit stiff. If it's like many chairs, it will loosen and tilt back better after a few weeks.4. Not hearing any creaks or popping sounds that have been described. My guess is people hearing those sounds did not go back and re-snug all of the bolts after tightening them all initially.5. Will update if there are any problems over the next few months but have none of the initial problems that are stated in the majority of negative reviews.6. If it lasts a couple of years, it will be a bargain for the price. We'll just have to see.",

                "reviewText": "Booooooy howdy. While the shipping was quick, I ordered it originally with Amazon Prime, so I can't even give it brownie points for that.When it showed up, manufacturing glue had clogged some of the bolt/screw holes, but that was easily cleaned out. What wasn't so easy to deal with, however, was that the holes *barely* lined up, and every one was crooked, so getting the thing assembled was a nightmare and a half. Solidly would have had an easier time assembling Ikea furniture, it was *that* sort of project, with generally poor instructions and the like. While this was a source of frustration unending for about four hours the night it showed up, as well as four hours where even a sailor would blush if they walked in my front door, it eventually got there. Now, I excused this as \"bulk manufactured goods\" issues and \"only $150 on Amazon for something 'nice' that landed on the cheaper end of the category\" issues, and was just going to leave it at that. Nothing to write home about. And then it was just one thing after the other with this thing.Leaned to the left a bit when it was sitting there, but not enough to notice unless you were looking at it from the back and really looking, which got accentuated of you sat in it but, again, it was only really noticeable when you looked at the back.The instructions say to tighten the bolts/screws every six(6) months. It didn't last last that long. It doesn't matter though, as we had to bust out the her key and tighten them every *two weeks*. The arm rests and the wheels were the primary culprits here, but it was basically universal.The lock for the reclining function kept slipping, and it was like it didn't even exist. Want to get flung backwards randomly when you have the audacity to lean just a little back? This chair can do that for you.And then the straw that broke the camel's (as well as nearly my husband's) back. Like you can see in the picture attached, even giving up on using the recliner lock won't stop you from getting flung backwards by surprise with this chair apparently. Wasn't the bolts or anything like that. No, of course not. It was the plastic (which, might I add, isn't as solid as it looks in the first picture. It's partially hollow, as shown in the second.) that decided to give way, 0 warning, with pretty obvious results. My husband got flung flat and had to catch himself to avoid worse injury, and there could have been other collateral damage as well, doubly so if he hadn't caught himself. Which, honestly, *is* something to write home about, thus the review.Was it easy to put together? Absolutely not. Was/is it supportive? About as much as it was easy to put together. Was/is it ergonomic? Not really? Honestly, ergonomics don't matter here though. All around, the whole experience? -15573893483726/10 would NOT recommend.",
