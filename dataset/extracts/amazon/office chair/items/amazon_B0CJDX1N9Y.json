Great price! Leather is soft. Chair is comfortable. It swivels, rolls, height is adjustable. Arm rests are thick and padded . Works well with my modern live edge desk. Seat is deep so if you are a shorty like me (5'2\"), you may need a pillow behind your back.",

I'm nowhere near the stated \"300lb max weight\" for this chair, butt you gotta know that a chair that can hold 300lbs will be cush for your tush if you're not that heavy. Also love the zippered back of the chair for storage space or to add a heat pad. Keep in mind, the armrests don't fold up, not a big deal and I knew that when I bought it. Great chair, great price!",

While this chair didn't match what I was looking for, I would purchase other product from this seller based solely on their excellent customer service.I should've paid better attention. I was looking for a big & tall chair, and this came up as one of the first choices. I saw the \"400 LBS\" picture and thought that would be more than sufficient (I weight around 255). But I didn't realize how short the back is. I'm 6'2\", and the back \"cushion\" doesn't even come up to my shoulders.About half of the chair hardware (the arms, the base, and the legs) is packed into the empty back \"cushion\", leaving very actual cushion for your back. I doubt very highly that it gives lumbar support; it's basically a thin layer of cushion and then nothing.The chair also feels tight, which seems bizarre for a chair advertising it can hold up to 400 lbs of weight. I measured the distance between my current chair and this one, and the distance between the two armrests is a full two inches shorter (19\" versus my current chair's 21\" body room).It's just a very uncomfortable chair. I'll be returning this.",
