                "reviewText": "This chair was a bit small for me-I am an oversize person, but it still works well. I gave it 4 stars only because myself and my assistant have gone to sit in the new chairs and they slid out from under us. My assistant is average size vs my plus size so this is just something to be aware of when you purchase. They look lovely and are holding up well. I had no difficulty putting them together.",

                "reviewText": "Excellent quality. Arrived on time and very easy to assemble. Have used it for over a month and there\u2019s nothing really to complain about. Works as described.A head/neck would\u2019ve been nice to have when working long hours.Cushion feels nice and comfortable. Although I have a chair gel cushion that I used for my previous leather chair, I didn\u2019t have to use it for this one. It\u2019s comfortable already by itself for all day use when working from home office.One very minor thing is that the small plastic caps provide to cover the holes for the screws keeps falling off. I just removed them and stored them away so I don\u2019t have to put them back every couple of days. But still doesn\u2019t look odd without those cover. Great chair overall.",

                "reviewText": "Caveat is that I've sat in it twice. Since the instructions said adult assembly i wasn't sure i could do it, but tried.The instructions were easy to follow. On the arm rest it said tighten 50% which you need to follow so the backrest screws would line up.I was impressed that they included one extra of each screw.The legs have one leg which you snap in place. I had to slip it in then pound it down to get it to snap. I weigh around 250 so this might be a weak point. If it is i see a way to fix it so no big deal.The biggest challenge was getting armrest screws to thread. Patience was the key here. Three went in easily and #4 was a challenge. When it would start to cross thread I would back off and screw it in elsewhere or swap it with one that worked. This might have been my fault. The lesson here is take your time. I used a flash light to make sure everything was lined up.Bottom line. I'm pleased.",

This is one of the few that does the job perfectly and has nice support in the back, is sturdy, has leaning options along with a decent height options for its size. Cushion is fine with my and I use it a decent amount for pc gaming. Super easy to set up, 1/2 an hour tops. They even give you spare parts of every component which is hard to find companies doing these days with their product. I\u2019ve seen reviews saying squeaks after a few weeks and one broke on someone, but I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s possible unless you didn\u2019t fully tighten the components or jump up and down on it. My single complaint is that the black little screw covers that are told to use on one of the final steps don\u2019t work at all. They keep popping out and just don\u2019t fit properly. Best to keep them off, which does no harm, unless you want to search the floor for small black dots every time you use the chair.",
