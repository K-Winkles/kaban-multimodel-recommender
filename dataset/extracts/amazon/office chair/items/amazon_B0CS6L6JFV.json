Pretty basic chair with a headrest but for the price I can't complain. It arrived 2 days before the estimated arrival so that was nice too.",

So far I'm ok with this chair, it's not the absolute greatest, but it is better than the one it's replacing(and will hopefully last longer). It was easily put together by one person(my son) in about 15 minutes or so. I will be using a previously purchased seat cushion for more comfort. I also want to mention(especially if you are tall)that the head rest isn't as high as in the pictures, it sits right on the top of the chair and as of this writing, the photos on the product page show space between the headrest and the chair back. It just won't move to adjust. I don't know, hopefully I will get used to having my head not line up with the headrest.",

                "reviewText": "This desk chair was easy to assemble using only the hex wrench that is provided (easier if you don't get \"help\" from a teen who won't read instructions).I like the adjustable lumbar support and head support. It reclines a little which allows me to rock/jiggle some while sitting at my desk. It feels stable and the wheels roll smoothly. It is cold weather now, but I look forward to the breathable mesh back once it is hot again. The armrests flip up so that the chair can be pushed all the way in without them bumping into the desk top. To clarify, the height of the armrests is not adjustable. They either flip up or are horizontal.The seat is not very cushy. I may end up adding a thin cushion to the seat. The fabric is a little rough if you plan on sitting with bare legs.The pictures are a close-up of the fabric and my hand (and kitchen floor) seen through the back of the chair.",

                "reviewText": "Arriving in a relatively small box, the chair required assembly. Everything inside the box was either bagged or in another box, you also get an instruction sheet.I found the instructions, clear and straightforward - I managed to assemble this in about 20 minutes entirely by myself. All the screws fitted the holes perfectly and once assembled it looks a very good chair for the price which was about \u00a3100 when delivered.I'm 5ft 7 and this chair is just perfect for me, the seat is height adjustable as is the head rest. The chair has a tilt mechanism and the arms flip up, you can tighten the resistance of the arms but you have to do it whilst assembling the chair - this is a bad design in my opinion. However I dislike these types of arms and would have preferred proper adjustable arms.The fabric on the arms and seat is nice to the touch and the back of the chair is mesh so you'll stay cool in the summer. The seat is quite thick, certainly compared to the cheaper chair I had bought previously - now I realise how bad that was! However it is a little firm, but may well be more forgiving over time - personally I find it just right.I also found the wheels glided nicely on a medium pile carpet and didn't get bogged down.The only issue I had was some white residue on the black parts of the chair, these wiped away easily however there was also a small mark on the back mesh which has not gone however you can't see it whilst sat in the chair so just 1 star docked as the QA could be better given everything was bagged up in the box.Overall this is a very good chair for the price and it really does look very good.",

                "reviewText": "Real pain to assemble but once it's done it's pretty goodThe instructions should say that you should attach the wheels to the five-spoke frame at the bottom first, then put the upright into it, and then install the bracket under the seat, and then do the rest of it about the arms and the back, because it doing it the other way around just means you've got more mess and it doesn't even take very long to assemble the other bits first, and some of their instructions make less logical sense than other companies however at least they do provide everything that you need. The overall feel is very good, and of course it's very rare to find a chair that can fold itself under the desk, which is perfect for those of you with smaller rooms or limited space around the desk.The arms are flip up and down and they're very comfortable adjusted for probably the average build, however if you want something with more adjustability then this is not itThe seat is very comfortable and the height adjustment is pleasant as wellNewton also pull the arm out and adjust the rocking motion from on to off but you can't lock it in place except uprightGreat chair and highly recommend",

I couldn't do it myself and actually had to ask my boyfriend to do it and took him around 30/35 min for fully assembly.After all that when it comes quality it seems ok but its all fabric including the armrests.It's not a top quality chair but its comfortable and works well, so far i have nothing bad to say about it.Love the fact i can make it look better by removing the headrest which i'm not particularly a fan of.Overall i recommend this item.",
