You start your search looking at office chairs, and six hours down the rabbit hole, you\u2019ve just bought a sensory deprivation tank. Anyway, I wanted something compact, comfortable, stylish, and easy to set up. This chair fits the bill splendidly.First, I chose this chair because I can store it flush under my desk when not in use, specifically due to the fact that it doesn\u2019t have arm rests. Fits under a standard height desk with no issues, and even some shorter desks because it adjusts up and down with the lever.I wanted a chair that was stylish and not a bulky, black, executive chair that\u2019s nice to look at but impractical to use. This chair looks really expensive given the price point of $100 approximately. Note, I chose camel color and it\u2019s a true to color.Comfort wise, so far I love this chair. Lumbar support is on point, it\u2019s got a wide seat and back. Feels plush. My butt thanks me. I am 5\u20196 and 135lbs; someone much taller and heavier would have no issue with this chair.I included a picture to show the ease of setup. It took longer to unpack/unwrap this chair from the box than the actual setup itself. Literally done in 4 steps and 2 minutes. I appreciate the ease in setup because I am just not good with manuals/directions. See: IKEA dresser that I installed drawers in, backwards. So the fact that my cat could have put this chair together, really was a plus for me.Highly recommend, will update periodically.Update: Feb 2019 -- Having this chair for nearly 8 months, I have some thoughts on it. For those who sit all day, every day at a desk, this chair is going to lack comfortable butt support over time. I am finding that some sort of orthopedic bolster to sit on, on this chair, would probably help significantly, as I am experiencing soreness and stiffness from sitting in this chair for extended periods despite getting up to take breaks. What I've also noticed too, which I didn't think about when purchasing, is that this chair lacks the ability to tilt back or rock back. Actually, the backpiece does not move. So, I am essentially sort of pushed forward in this chair, and it is giving me some spinal strain. Structurally, it has held up. The leatherette hasn't worn down. The wheels haven't popped off. Aesthetically, it is a stylish chair. BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR MY BUTT, this chair is likely going to be replaced sometime soon, as it's just not as comfortable as I hoped it would be over the course of time. Out of the box was great, but padding has worn and lumbar observation noted above, is sending me back to the rabbit hole to find something more suited for me.",

I bought this for $129 back then and then prices skyrocketed in 2022 (doubled in price) like everything else so when this went on sale for $139 on Amazon I jumped on it! I'm so glad!I'm 5'11 and 180 lbs and I used this chair almost daily for 5 years, about 8 hours a day/7 days a week (I work at my desk ever day). It held up well until last year the seat started to develop a few cracks and also the padding started to wear out. No real complaints though because again, I use this chair a LOT.This new one is exactly the same though it now seems to have better bolts on the underside. I do feel like it may have less padding on the seat than before, but it's not obvious (so I could be wrong).These take about 5 minutes to setup. It's super easy and didn't require any tools.For $139 if it lasts as long as the old one, then I'd say I got my money's worth. It's very unique in colour and style and sure beats boring garish gaming chairs and ugly bland black/grey office chairs.",
