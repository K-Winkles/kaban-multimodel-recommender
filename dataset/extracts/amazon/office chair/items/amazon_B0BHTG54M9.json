Unlike my previous chair (which had a flat back), the backseat literally makes you sit straight because of the curves so that's a plus. Chair looks nice and for the value, better than most other chairs in this price range.Instructions were pretty clear, very easy. One problem was that one of the screws didn't screw in all the way in the bottom but the part was secure in its location, holding tightly. Not really bothered about it.Remember to keep the screw tool. Never know when you might need to tighten the bolts. The tool even fits on the screws to my other chair. So it's pretty handy.",

I got 2 of these for my home office and they were required some effort to put together because of the large bolts and because i wanted everything to be super strong for years to come. They run smoothly on the floor. Folding side handles is an advantage, too. All tools and bolts were good. The back is ergonomic, airy and comfortable at the same time.",

                "reviewText": "It feels a little cheap - it is, after all, for an ergonomic chair - but I love that I can move the armrests out of the way, and the ergonomic back curve is very supportive. Overall a good chair for working from home. Instructions say to fix the armrests to the base first and then fix them to the back. Do it the other way around or the back won't properly align with the armrests, and you will really struggle! Other than that, easy to assemble.",

                "reviewText": "Don't ignore the tips on these ratings about how to put this thing together, rather than in the order of the instructions. I did, and it took me almost 2 hours to take apart and reassemble. AND it's still not right (one side's drilled holes don't line up, resulting in my purchased chair being kind if wobbly, NOT something that makes it feel safe). I bought this over a year ago, and got lazy, relying on the old broken down one I have had for years, and that chair still feels safer than this one. Tilt function also isn't working. Guess I'll have to disassemble a second time to see if that can be corrected. Obviously, I would not purchase again. Cannot recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This is a pretty comfy desk chair, I love that the arms fold up for convenience. DON'T even consider the cheaper version of this chair that is very similar- I almost did that and also glad I went with this one. The wheels roll easily on the floor, the cushion is comfortable for a few hours of sitting, and the mesh back is nice to keep my back supported and cool. The arms do fold up straight and the dont go all the way behind the back of the chair but it's not really hindered my comfort while using the chair. I had no trouble following the easy to read directions, everything came in the packaging and I had it put together in about 15 minutes. I am very pleased with it.",
