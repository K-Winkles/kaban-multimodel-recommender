                "reviewText": "I've had this chair for a year. I got it mid-pandemic for $130. I think it's a reasonable value. The seat is soft and well-cushioned. I wish it was almost a little longer for more thigh support, but I'm a big person and it fits me pretty well other than that. I use this chair daily while working from home.Overall, it's held up well, with the exception of one of the armrests. After about 9 months, the rubber material covering has torn on the bottom edge and on the top. The tears are about an inch long each. The armrest still works fine and hasn't lost any foam, but I could see that happening if I don't find a way to tape/cover the tear.The chair is comfortable, and there are several kinds of adjustments available. It's also very sturdy, both the chair and the armrests.When the chair arrived, the hydraulic lift had expanded and punched through the box it shipped in. I haven't had any issues with it and just wanted to give everyone a heads up. Assembly was mostly easy and the instructions made sense. My biggest problem with the chair was when I attached the chair to the part with the levers. The placement of the levers and a bump of plastic as well as the slots for the screws made it hard to get in with the Allen key to tighten them down. I think some of the holes weren't tapped straight and were slightly misaligned, which also made it harder to screw in the bolts. The chair starts to squeak when I lean back every couple of months, so I just flip it over, tighten those bolts, and it's quiet for another couple of months.Other than the armrest tears, which you really only see when you're looking right at them, the chair doesn't look worn at all. I don't really like the silver decoration at the top of the wheelbase, but it looks nice overall. I'd recommend it.",

I bought the MFTC chair in 2015 from Office Depot for $99 on sale and it does go on sale every so often. The cushion has worn out and the armrests crack. I suspect the same will happen with this Flash Furniture branded chair also so I didn't even bother to attach the cheap armrests.\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Brand/Manufacturer \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1 Flash Furniture Executive Swivel- Belnick LLC (Not the true OEM)\u25a1 Realspace MFTC 200 - Anji Grand Orient Furniture Co. Ltd (Office Depot/Max brand)\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0I couldn't find the real OEM for Belnick's Flash Furniture branded chair, the bottom labels didn't reveal anything. The Realspace is made by Anji Grand Orient Furniture Co. Ltd as labeled on the bottom of the chair. Belnick has warehouses in Georgia, Ohio, Mississippi, and California otherwise no further information about the OEM. The chairs are very closely identical making me suspect it's highly plausible it's from the same manufacturer as the Realspace.\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Origin \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1 Flash Furniture - Made In China\u25a1 Realspace MFTC - Made In China\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0Both chairs are made in China, Realspace has it on the bottom label of the seat and FF has it on the outside of the box.\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Seat Cushion Quality \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1 FF - A cushioned contour shaped for your bottom\u25a1 RS MFTC - No contour at all\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0The bottom of the FF chair is made of a plastic base and the RS MFTC is made of a heavier wood base with the upholstery stapled onto the seat. If you ever want to reupholster your seat in the future (like I probably will be doing) then buy the RS MFTC. I suspect the plastic base chosen in the FF task chair is to reduce shipping weight and cost. I can't be sure that the current RS MFTC still uses a wooden base as the seat. While the FF chair has a nice contoured cushion, I feel that over time the area where you sit may sink in over time leaving the outside portions you are not sitting on raised up high. The RS MFTC cushion may sink a lot faster if you are heavier in weight, I am only about 155 lbs, and the cushion still sunk over time fully flattening with zero support left.\u2593 If you need the cushion to be comfortable, I would choose the FF chair as the seat is contoured. The RS MFTC cushion lies flat and over time you will need to reupholster the cushion or purchase a memory foam cushion to place on top of it after the cushion flattens. \u2593\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Seat Height \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1 FF - 18.5\" lowered, 23\" raised (based on top of cushion)\u25a1 RS MFTC - 15\" lowered, 20\" (based on top of cushion)\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0If you have short legs then get the RS MFTC as it sits lower, if you have longer legs go with the FF as it sits higher. Your legs will be dangling off the FF if you have short legs or your feet will not be planted on the floor comfortably.\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Seat Tilt Adjustments \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1 FF - Tilt function only leans backward, no way to lean forward\u25a1 RS MFTC - Tilt function only leans forward, leans back very little\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0There is no way to lean back on the RS MFTC task chair like the FF chair if that matters to you. And I am sure I installed it correctly as it is impossible to put the backrest mesh on if you put the bracket on incorrectly. The RS MFTC is more fitting for shorter individuals who would like to be able to plant their feet onto the floor comfortably.\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Backrest Mesh \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1 FF - 15\" wide (measured sitting down at waist width)\u25a1 RS MFTC - 18\" wide (measured sitting down at waist width)\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0I felt that both meshes provided good lumbar support as they both can be placed in a vertical position and tilted backward if you need to lean back for some reason. However, I did find that the width of the RS MFTC's backrest was much more satisfying. While both chairs provided adequate lumbar support the width of the RS MFTC chair just felt a lot more comfortable. There is a weird plastic accordion insert for the FF chair which felt cheap and tacky that did not properly expand up enough when the backrest was raised. I believe over time it would probably dry out and crack and split at the seams that join the plastic together. Both chairs' backrest mesh can be adjusted vertically to fit your torso height.\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Arm Rests \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1 FF - Poor Quality\u25a1 RS MFTC - Poor Quality\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0Both are very identical in shape, size, function, and quality with the RS MFTC barely being a little bit better in quality but not by much. The armrests will crack over time, I didn't even bother to attach the FF armrests on arrival and assembly.\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Ease of Assembly \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a1 FF - Very Easy\u25a1 RS MFTC - Medium\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0In terms of assembly, I found the FF chair to be much easier to assemble for the reason being that the holes lined up well and the screws were easy to tighten. I found that the RS MFTC chair was slightly more difficult to assemble because of the screw quality but not more significantly difficult. I had to use a socket wrench to tighten the RS MFTC screws because they were slightly more difficult to tighten with the supplied Allen wrench.\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Conclusion \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0While both chairs were pretty comparable in function, quality, and comfort I was more satisfied with the Realspace MFTC200 besides the poorly supported cushion. Smaller individuals should choose the Realspace MFTC200, larger individuals should consider the Flash Furniture Executive Swivel. If a comfortable seat cushion is your priority then you may like the Executive Swivel better. Both chairs have their place and it's never a one-size-fits-all in the budget space.\u258c Flash Furniture Executive Swivel \u258c+ Better for large/heavy individuals+ Better contoured seat cushion+ Tilts backward- Not as good for shorter individuals- Backrest mesh is not as wide- Can't tilt seat forward\u258c Realspace MFTC200 \u258c+ Better for smaller/lighter individuals+ Wider backrest mesh+ Tilts forward- Seat cushion not contoured- Seat cushion flattens over time- Can't tilt seat backward",

It's overall comfortable and exactly what I was looking for.Issues: Then the adjustable seat back wouldn't stay in place vertically, so it would continuously slide down no matter how tight the knob was turned. And then the creaking started. Non stop creaking. I tightened every screw and it didn't make a difference.Warranty / Lack of Support: This chair has a 2 year warranty. Within the warranty period I reached out to Flash Furniture. It took over weeks for them to even acknowledge my claim. Then they opened a ticket under a mattress - which was obviously not what I had purchased. Finally they said they were 'shipping me a part to fix the issue' without confirming anything (shipping address, what this part would do, etc.). The part was shipped and I watched it travel on FedEx from Georgia, around a few states and back to Flash Furniture in Georgia. I still don't have it and no one is answering me.So at this point I'm shopping for a new chair. Warranty is useless - beware.",
