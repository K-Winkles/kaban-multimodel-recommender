I love to cook, and the chair helps me through those \"bad back\" days that still linger many years after surgery.I've had mine for a few weeks... I honestly don't remember any sticking points putting it together - I think it took 30-40 minutes by myself, but I don't rush these things like I did when I was youngerAt max height, it's plenty high for working at a standaed 30\" high counter.Just be careful leaning forward - I've had the chair recoil backwards across the kitchen and nearly put me on my narrow rear end a few times.(For reference, I'm 6'0 and about 135lbs) There's plenty of room, and the footrest works fine for me at max height.Seriously, if you're any less clumsy that I am, or you're just using the chair at a desk instead of in a kitchen, you'll be fine.Oh... any and all stains and marks on the chair are from me. I put my kitchen things through a lot!",
