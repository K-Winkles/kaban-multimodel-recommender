                "reviewText": "As I type this review, I am sitting in this chair. It is such a massive upgrade compared to what I was sitting in before, and I already feel so much more comfortable and relaxed.When the package arrived, it came in this big old box with all the parts tightly held together to prevent shifting during shipping. It also came with a very simple manual on how to set up the chair, some screws and a monkey wrench. All in all, I laid out all the pieces and it took me about a solid 30 minutes to set up the entire chair. The setup was pretty straightforward, just make sure you follow the instructions to the letter, and maybe having an extra pair of hands could help you finish putting it together faster.Now let's talk about comfortability. This chair is comfortable, as it supports my posture and allows my body to relax. I don't have to lean forward on my desk or worry about resting my arms somewhere, as the armrests can be adjusted to your liking. The height adjustment is also great, and simple to use.If you plan on purchasing any office or at-home desk chair, buy this one and I promise you will not regret your decision!",

The flip-up armrests also add to the BIG COMFORT FACTOR!, as they allow for easy movement and are adjustable according to the user's preference. The chair is also adjustable, which is a great feature for those who spend long hours at their desks (me). The height of the chair can be adjusted to suit the user's height, and the tilt tension can be adjusted to provide the perfect amount of support and resistance when leaning back. No damaged parts, no damage to box, great packaging overall.",

For the price, there are not many adjustments that can be done to make it more comfortable; pretty much up and down only. Gave it it 3 stars because the color is as described, easy to assemble and it looks pretty good.UPDATE: The company reached out after my original review. They seem to care and stated that their R&D team would work on my concerns. We went back and forth a few times, and they responded very quickly. Adding one more star for great customer service.",

                "reviewText": "I could not even assemble this chair because the screw holes did not line up between the chair cushion and the metal plate. I examined it very carefully and adjusted it very carefully, but the problem was not fixable: the holes of the cushion and the metal plate were about a quarter inch off from each other and there was no way to get the screws to go through. I can't imagine they are all like this (at least I hope not), so best case is they sent me a defective unit. I wrote to the company and got NO response. I suggest you do not purchase this chair - you cannot be sure what piece of junk they might end up sending you.UPDATE: The company finally did reach out to me, and they worked with me in good faith to try to solve the problem. They not only gave me a full refund, they sent me another chair free of charge. So I give them a lot of credit. Unfortunately the replacement chair had the same defect (see photo). The holes on the seat cushion and the back plate do not match, so cannot be connected. Apparently they got a bad batch of these chairs from the manufacturer. Hopefully they will fix it, but you might be taking a chance. In any case, if you do get a bad chair, at least you won't lose any money.",
