                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this chair to upgrade from my old one, and it was delivered on time. Assembly was quick, took me about 20-25 minutes even without using any instructions. Upon completion, my initial impression was one of regality and elegance, it has leather covering that is wear resistance. The chair's comfort is particularly noteworthy, addressing my need for extended seating during long hours.It looks durable & it can handle high weight limits, leather is heavy-duty and a robust frame supported by a sturdy metal base capable of accommodating up to 500lbs. This makes it an ideal choice for individuals with a larger build.The chair is equipped with ergonomic lumbar support that can be easily adjusted to meet individual preferences. Its flexibility allows for forward or backward movement, which helps with spinal support, relieving back pressure, and comfort for extended periods of work, study, or gaming. The cushion is well padded which is crafted with thick foam, it adds to the overall comfort.It offers a 360\u00b0 free swivel and a 3.94-inch adjustable height. To safeguard my floor, I use a floor mat to prevent any potential scratching from the wheels. This chair seamlessly combines style, durability, and comfort, making it a splendid addition to my workspace.",

                "reviewText": "The best part about this chair IMO is that it gets the seat height right. Many of these heavy chairs sit too low even when fully raised.What I like:The chair's padding is firm and supportive. It doesn't wobble under weight. The wheels roll smoothly. Assembly was very straightforward. The arms have recesses that lock into the screw bosses of the back, so attaching it was way simpler than it is with a lot of chairs that go together the same way this one does.The instructions are well illustrated and well written. There's even a QR code that takes you to an assembly video which is very well done.Of course, I like that the seat height advertised is accurate. (I tried several chairs where it wasn't and they sat too low).The rocking works well - it doesn't let you tilt so far back you think you're going to tip over.What I don't like:The hex wrench handle should be rounded. It isn't sharp but it has pointy edges that hurt your hands when you apply the amount of force needed to tighten these screws.There are a ton of quality control issues, starting with the way it's packed. When this arrived, one of the legs of the base had busted through the side of the box and scraped on something - there were spots where the paint was scratched off.This wasn't properly cleaned or shipped with silicone drying pads. There was a white crusty substance on the base that almost looked like salt. If it hadn't been painted I would have thought it was flux residue.You can see foam poking out of one of the arm rests where the lining wasn't properly positioned before the cushion was fixed to the armrest.The seat has a rather large and obvious scuff mark near one corner, despite arriving with the plastic protective cover intact.Conclusion:500lb is probably exaggerating a bit. It could probably stand that for about five minutes. But 250 I believe it can do all day every day. This is not a scientific opinion, it's just my best guess. It's comfortable, easy to assemble and looks nice despite having some QC problems. I feel like it's over priced by about 15% but otherwise it's a great chair and I can recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "The assembly instructions include adding the lumbar support control without securing the attached cord. Unfortunately that means the cord hangs down at just the hight for little fingers and is wide enough for a child to get their head into and get stuck. We adjusted the installation to catch the cord under the seat plate and it seems to be doing fine.The chair itself is extremely comfortable - some of us have even slept in it. The rocking is natural and smooth and the wheels glode easily even over carpet.The materials are very strong and I don't doubt the high weight limit. It's not quite as tall as we had hoped, but it works. I am 5 foot 9 inches and the headrest is perfect for me. For my 6 foot 3 inch tall husband it is a tad low.Overall an excellent executive chair with minor tweaks needed for a home office.",
