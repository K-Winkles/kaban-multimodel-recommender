I searched for a while read reviews until I came to this chair it looked like it covered everything I needed so I bought it for my husband who had had back surgeries & his back didn't heal straight so he needed the back support to help avoid slumping so badly ,it took a minute to adjust but he loves it & admitted that it is in fact giving support in all the right ways.. BUT it is missing 1 important quality it does NOT adjust to tilt or recline back not even a little so the sitting up right constantly does still affect him, other then that he said that everything else is perfect & the quality of material is worth the price, I did up grade the basic wheels to give better mobility to move on carpet. If you don't mind sitting straight this is definitely worth the purchase & it looks & feels high quality.",

It's large, big enough for a tall person.It was delivered early so that's a plus.The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that it arrived with damage on the arm and I would have to disassemble and send back to get a replacement, not worth the work.The only reason I'm being picky is that I would like to keep this chair for a long time and I can already see the damage is chipping away.",
