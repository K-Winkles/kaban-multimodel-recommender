It took maybe 15 20 min where with other chairs might be 30 min to an hour when the holes and bolts don't line up properly. The next thing is how comfortable it is for my bad hip and bad back. Great seat cushion that doesn't flatten and the back and head support is great. I am 6 ft 1 and the height is great for a tall person. The only thing is I wish it was a little bit wider for my butt since I am a big guy at 380 pounds.In the end this is a great sturdy comfortable chair at a great price!",

                "reviewText": "I bought model LB-2818H in black. I was looking for a supportive chair, for a plus size frame, that didn't make my bottom sweat or ache after an hour of use. I work from home and have used this chair for 8 hours daily, for the past 3 weeks. So far, it's been comfy, cool, supportive and I love that the arms fold up and head rest is adjustable. For reference, I'm 5'4, 300, curvy bottomed and the width and height work perfectly. I did also purchase an under desk foot rest/cushion so I can stretch my legs and use it to push off of so I can lean back throughout the day. Although I read in one review the chair doesn't recline, it indeed will. For the quality, comfort and price, I'd definitely recommend!!!",

                "reviewText": "This chair is just what I was looking for. I'm 5'6\" and heavy. I've tried other chairs that seemed right on day 1 but within a week I felt like I had to fight to stay in the chair instead of it sliding me out forward. This one has more of a bucket design so I feel more supported. The chair itself feels sturdy. It can tip back but stops itself at an angle where I don't feel like I'm in danger of toppling. There is no built in footrest which suits me fine, the other chairs that have had one didn't feel strong enough to support me and would slide out willy nilly and get in my way. I like the headrest, my son who is taller doesn't so he swivels it back so it's out of his way. The arm rests are okay for me but they also can lift out of the way if I don't want to use them. The chair rolls easily on my floor. I waited a few weeks to review it and I'm at least as pleased now as I was when it was brand new. My son assembled it so I can't comment on how way it would have been for me to do it. I'm sure there are even better chairs out there but I've spent more before and been less happy, especially for the price point this one is a winner.",

                "reviewText": "I'm 6'6 & 350lb and this chair works like a dream. I was concerned the chair wouldn't hold up as many that claim a higher max capacity weight, usually don't actually support it. I sat in this chair and held 2 25 pound weights above my head in the upright and leaned back position and didn't hear a creak or have anything break. Now I'm not advising you to use this this to lift weights, but that was 400 pounds on the chair and it took it like a champ where other would squeak for mercy lol. Easy assembly, took maybe 30 minutes to get everything set up while following the assembly video in the product pictures from the manufacturer, so kudos to them for that. The main thing I was looking for was back support and I'm happy to report the back support here is excellent. I feel no back press after sitting in it for a few hours straight both leaning back and upright. There's a little removable pillow in the back of the chair that can be adjusted for an ideal personal fit. The arm rests do not swivel or adjust, only go up in a position beside the back of the chair or down, which help when trying to put the chair under a desk if your desk isn't necessarily enough. While it wasn't a favor for me, it may be for some. The chair does sit relatively high on the highest setting if you're under 6 feet, but on the lowest setting my 5'7 partner was able to have their feet flat in the ground, so this chair could work for you if you're under 6 feet but above 5'2 on the lowest setting. Just crank it up for when you want to swing your feet like a kid if anything lol. The roller skate style wheels are something people pay for separately for on other chairs to reinforce support and not mess up carpet, so the fact that this chair came with them as a default was a major plus. The headrest snaps into 4 positions for added comfort when leaning back. This chair is everything I could ask for coming from one of those crappy gaming chairs; between the comfort and the ease of setting up, it's an easy recommend for my larger friends.",

Extremely comfortable, so much nicer on the seat and spine than the usual gaming chair. High enough back for tall person and roomier than the average chair in the seat as well. I can\u2019t speak to durability as we\u2019ve only had it a month but so far so great and would definitely buy it again when time to replace another gaming chair.",

The headrest, in my opinion, is a pretty silly addition, and it looks like one of those wheelchairs where are you need head support.It is reasonably comfortable, and, for the money, I would probably get something different. I thought about returning it but, it is way too much trouble so I will settle with it.What I recommend it? I don\u2019t think so.",

Seat design (finally) leaves my tail bone out of the equation hence sitting for longer hours is a breeze. Still fit after. I am 6\u20194\u201d and 280 lbs and the chair fits like a glove ! Even taller would work (3 , 4 inches should work).The only item that could improve is the leaning back feature. A little further would make it more comfortable, however, I hardly use this feature anymore now that I can sit up straight and not get a soar bum all the time!Arm rest to seat ratio is perfect. Needs no adjustable features. This product is worth every penny! My back says the same \ud83d\ude0e",
