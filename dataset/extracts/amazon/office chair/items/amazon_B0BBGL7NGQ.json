Instructions are straightforward with pictures (I\u2019ve put together an office chair before). The lumbar support is small and low so I\u2019ve added my own pillow for more support. The chair takes some \u201cbreaking in\u201d, I also added a pillow for my tailbone for sitting for long periods because (just like any chair) it comes out the box a little \u201cstiff\u201d. The massaging is largely a strong vibration vs rollers like other massage chairs and I haven\u2019t used the heated feature as it\u2019s still quite warm out. Overall, it works as intended.",

I have had 3 car accidents and I needed this chair, it provides deep massage and comfortable heat with different modes and levels for your entire back. Only think Iam almost 6 feet, the foot rest is a bit too short for me. But overall Ism comfortable for my size, Iam 267lbs easy, good fit. The color is amazing, and the feel of real leather great.

I sat with dark jeans and the chair stained and won\u2019t come off ( I purchased the off white/cream color one). The massage feature is more like a vibration and very minimal. I was disappointed. The cushion is also very minimal after a month or two it feels like you are sitting on a plank of wood. You will need to get some cushion to put on top. I personally do not recommend this chair. The price is good but the chair is not of good quality. I would recommend to invest a bit more and get a good quality chair if you are someone like me who works from home and spends 8 hrs a day on it.",
