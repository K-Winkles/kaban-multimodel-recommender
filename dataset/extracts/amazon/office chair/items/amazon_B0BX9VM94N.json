                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is the second chair I've purchased but a different variety. This is the low back version and I have the tall back version for over a year now. I really like both chairs. The pad of the chair does soften up over time. It's pretty hard when you first get it, but it's still gives you a lot of support and it doesn't soften to the point of discomfort. I'm really excited about this chair because I'm in a much smaller space and the large high back chair. It's a wider seat and it's a higher back and this smaller chair in my living room looks much better than the larger version. I appreciate the fun orange stitching on the larger version that the smaller one doesn't have, which I do miss a little bit. It gave it some style but I do love the texture and feel of this particular vinyl. It doesn't squeak or creek. It rolls very nicely. It took 5 minutes to put together and comes with all the tools you need and directions. The only thing I'll miss is having my dog tucked up behind my back on the smaller version of the chair as the seat is smaller, but the seat is a perfect size for me and also the chair itself can get taller than the large version and I appreciate that because I always felt like I was down too low. My desk is fairly high and the smaller version of this chair does adjust to a higher seating height.",

The big thing for me is that the locking lever stays where you put it so I am not constantly putting the chair back up.

It is pretty and very easy to put together, just not the most comfortable. Updating this review a few weeks later. Still horribly uncomfortable! The chair is advertised as having lumbar support, but the back piece slopes the opposite way of what I would consider lumbar support. I have to put multiple pillows on it to make it bearable, but even that doesn\u2019t last for more than a few hours. Plus the arm rests are very low with no way of adjusting them. Very disappointed. Trying to do a refund, but I am going to guess the seller isn\u2019t going to be flexible with a refund.",
