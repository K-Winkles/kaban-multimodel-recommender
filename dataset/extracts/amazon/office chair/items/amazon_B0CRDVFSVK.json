                "reviewText": "EASY TO ASSEMBLE: I put the chair together with my 5 year olds help. After we were done she tried it out and gave her big stamp of approval. I then tried the chair out. COMFORT: I was concerned about the chair only having a 130 degree recline compared to those with 170 degree recline, but once I leaned back and put my feet up I felt so good in the chair. I fell asleep and found myself waking up 2 hours later, just to doze off again. Not sure if I will be very productive at work, lol, but my hips feels great! The chair is the perfect amount of sturdy when the lever is down, and the perfect amount of comfort, rock, and decline when the lever is pulled up. DIMENSIONS: This chair is the perfect height for my 30 inch tall desk, when it is on the shortest setting. I am 5'5'' and my feet sit firmly on the ground on the lowest setting. The chair is deep and so soft that i can barely feel it under me. It does not cut into the legs or hips. I weigh over 350lbs and this chair feels amazing. Good buy. High quality feel.",

                "reviewText": "The shipping didn\u2019t take long at all. The chair is as shown in the picture. I love the gray color. The chair is comfortable. The foam gives a bit but isn\u2019t too soft to cause you to sink into the chair. The armrests are great and the pillow is nice as well. The footrest is a nice size. Both of my chubby legs fits on it comfortably with room left on the sides. It took about 40 minutes to put the chair together. It was pretty simple and straight forward. The chair is heavy so I\u2019d recommend putting it together in the area you will have it in! I\u2019m a size 18 in women and I have an extra helping of thighs and hips. This chair has more than enough room for me! If you\u2019re plus size get this chair! I\u2019m only 5\u20194 but the chair does not seem too tall at all. While sitting the my head is about 2 inches above the top of it. Also, I love how full the cushions are on this chair. When looking at others some of them seemed thin and baggy. You won\u2019t have that issue with this at all. It\u2019s a 10/10 for me!",
