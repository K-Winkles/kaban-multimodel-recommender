                "reviewText": "Chair was delivered quickly and was fairly easy to put together, but I was disappointed to see that the instruction manual that came with the chair indicates the maximum weight limit is only 220 lbs (102 kg) and NOT the 300 lb. load that is noted in multiple places on the Amazon listing. I specifically bought this chair because of the higher weight limit and so am very disappointed to find that I was lied to. It seems to be fine and has no trouble bearing my 230 lb body, but I can't help but wonder if the heavier weight load will shorten the overall life of the chair. Other than that misleading detail, the chair seems well constructed and is quite comfortable. Hopefully it will continue to hold up...",

It took both of us to line up properly to avoid one side popping back out as the screws were being put in. The FINAL outcome was worth it and GREAT on my lower back!!!! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd Thanks",

The wheels/casters on it though... wow. Just the lowest quality possible. Never really pivot right. More scrape then slide. Basically 1/4\" thin plastic strips and not wheels. If you're on hardwoods or anything like that, steer clear.",
