                "reviewText": "From the beginning, I was skeptical of this chair, however the reviews I read gave me hope. I have suffered from a back injury at the end of this past year. I believe the strain in my back has a lot to do with the cheap office chair I have used prior to investing in this new office chair.This chair was fairly easy to put together. I was unsure how well the mesh would hold up but it is very high quality material. I have been using this chair for a few months now and it seems this chair is built to last, unlike many other chairs I have used.Initially with my chronic sciatica, I had trouble sitting in the chair. It's not the chair's fault though, the chair actually has helped to improve my back significantly with the lumbar support. The customer service has been phenomenal. I honestly can't believe how genuine these people are and how much they care about your experience with the chair. They reached out to me asking how everything was with this chair, and I was brutally honest. I told them how I struggled to sit in the chair because of my severe back pain and how it was a bit difficult to move the chair around on the carpet. The customer service rep Cayla was very understanding and offered upgrades to the chair such as the lumbar support pillow and roller blade wheels for greater ease of movement on the carpet. The lumbar support pillow helped for awhile and after some time, I did not need to use it anymore. The design of the chair is actually perfect for my back which I've come to realize after using it for so long. My back has been healing slowly, but it's so much better now, far less pain than before. When asked again more recently about how my experience has been going with this chair, I had one more complaint which is the fact that my elbows have been hurting a bit because the armrests are a little bit too hard for me. Without hesitation, Cayla immediately said she would have armrest covers sent to remedy this problem. Now I definitely wouldn't mind paying for these upgrades, but customer service didn't give me any hassle about that, the whole experience has been completely stress free and the focus has been about my comfort and well being while using this chair. I must say, this chair does not disappoint! I'm waiting on the armrest covers and I can't wait to see how well they improve my experience, but I expect they will be very comfortable. I work from home in my office so I definitely needed this chair and I am very happy so far with my experience. I didn't take pictures in my office because it's a bit messy, but you can see how well the chair is designed in the pictures and this chair is definitely a good investment, especially for those who are suffering from back problems. The chair helps improve your posture which is probably one of the biggest issues I had with my previous chair.If you are trying to figure out if this chair is right for you, I would recommend that you go for it. Even if there are any small issues, customer service will make everything right, they are amazing people! The overall design of the chair is impressive, helps your back and is very comfortable when you get used to sitting in it for a long time.",

                "reviewText": "I got this chair about 6 months ago. I'm a bachelor and I've been sitting on folding metal chairs so this was a SIGNIFICANT improvement. That being said, I do use office chairs at my various jobs, so I've had a moderate level of experience with chairs.The packaging was sturdy, as others have mentioned. The chair came undamaged. For assembly, there are tools and instructions provided. I'm fairly handy and it took me about 15 minutes to set up the chair.When I sat down in the chair for the first time I breathed a sigh of satisfaction. I'm 6'/180 lbs, and the chair is spacious enough for me to feel comfortable, tall enough to provide full body support, and adjustable based on my needs.Over the past six months the best thing about the chair is that I don't usually notice it. The chair does it's job well and I can focus on my work. There are a few times I notice it and think about the chair. I contacted customer support about a few of them, and they were very responsive. Here's the things I've noticed.The first is that sometimes I wish the arm rests were closer in. They could be closer in if I took out one of the screws but I'm not inclined to tradeoff the stability and sturdiness for having closer armrests. I will often adjust the top rests inwards to have a closer resting place for my arms.The second is that it was hard to move on carpet. This isn't the chairs fault, lots of chairs are hard to move on carpet. I should get a mat, frankly. I received some different wheels for the chair from GABRYELLY, and they increased the ease of movement enough that it was noticeable. They are more likely to require me to get out of my chair to adjust them sometimes, so I'm not sure which I prefer, as the other ones were hard to move but I never had to get up.Another is that it didn't feel like the chair was tall enough for me. Perhaps my desk is taller than many, but the upper limit of the chair wouldn't allow me to rest comfortably at first. When I asked GABRYELLY about this, they said that they had high gasrods (the center support bar of the chair) but that they were out of stock. The new wheels they sent me were tall enough that it just met my requirement, and I'm happy with the new height of the chair.The built in lumbar support is enough for those with good to moderate posture. When I asked customer support for a lumbar pillow, they promptly provided me with one. The lumber pillow is comfortable and nice, but I've found that the straps with buckles don't stay where you put them on this chair model. The straps slide down and I have to adjust them. It's annoying enough that I usually just place the pillow without buckling it and hold it there with my back. That works great for me, although it's tedious sometimes, I mostly don't notice it except for when I'm tired of holding posture.Finally, I notice the chair when I sit down in it. The thing is so darn comfortable! I also notice when I engage the leaning lever and relax backwards to the perfect angle. It's very nice and I appreciate having this chair very much.Customer support, as others have mentioned, is very responsive. There were a couple things to note.1. They eventually told me they only give one freebie per order. I've seen others who have received requests for trade ins, and I'm not sure if that affects things at all. I also am not sure if they would offer to sell me something past the freebies.2. They do ask you to give five star reviews. This doesn't bother me as the reviews are my deciding factor in buying on Amazon - and the chairs, as I've mentioned, are high value, and worth five stars.3. They didn't say anything about extending my warranty after I emailed them four or five months later. There may be a timeline on this. If I were you, I would try out the chair for a week and let customer support know how you like it sooner than I did, and they can help you sooner. They may even convince you to write a review ;)I liked the chair enough that I bought one for my brother, who lives with me. He's 6'3\", and 250lbs. He's enjoyed the chair a lot as well, although he's not much for in-depth reviews. In neither mine, nor my brothers case has the chair degraded in quality in any way after buying it. I'm not sure how long chairs are supposed to last, but these one last at least 6 months from my experience, and they are going strong!If you have a comfortable budget, I would recommend this chair. They have other models if you have less budget room, and in that case I can still recommend the customer service, although I haven't tried their other chairs.",
