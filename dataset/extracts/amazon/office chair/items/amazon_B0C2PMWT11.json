I came across this product and gave it a shot. I\u2019m 6\u20191 240lbs and wanted a chair that has the support. I am very impressed with this chair! Very good quality! The cushion support is amazing and feel very comfortable when on it for long periods of time. I work remote some days out of the week and have felt improvements already! Easy to assemble and packaging was also fantastic! Great for my weight and height!",

The rollers are perfect, durable, and easy to roll around on a vinyl floor. The arms are adjustable, and very padded, which was important for her. The seat is very thick and comfortable and the material on the back is vented so you don\u2019t get hot.",

Easy fix of just jamming them with something so they dont move. All in all...Great chair!",
