                "reviewText": "It's advertised correctly but it's not spectacular or anything. It's not a soft cushioned chair. I had to buy a extra seat pad because it makes my butt go numb after a couple hours. It's easy to put together but one of the arms had extra metal inside one of the screw holes and my dad had to file it out with an industrial drill. If you need a cheap office chair and can afford a extra cushion then this is a good option. It's sturdy and the leather looks and feels nice, it's just not a plush luxury office chair.",

The chair just started rocking from side to side and front to back every time I moved. I thought it was unsafe to sit in any longer and I was 1 week past the date for returns. I would not buy another one.",
