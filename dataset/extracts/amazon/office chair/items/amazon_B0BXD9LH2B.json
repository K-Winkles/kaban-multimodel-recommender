The chair reclines and the leg rest extends so that if you have been sitting too long you can lean back and lock it in place for a relaxing stretch! The chair is sturdy and it was very easy to assemble. Quite possibly the best chair I have ever purchased!",

Chair was easy to assemble and did it myself in about 30 mins. Super comfortable and nice to recline in might add a cushion to heighten comfort. Looks great and sleek in office. The only thing I wish it had was armrest that flip up and out the way just for more customization BUT they are adjustable and yo can change the height.",

                "reviewText": "Holy cow, this chair!I finally placed the order for this chair and next day was being poked by screws from my old chair and wishing that I hadn't waited so long. But it arrived a day early, thankfully. I was so impressed by the sturdiness, fit and finish of this throne when first opening the package! I needed something super strong as I have a small herd of giant dogs who don't mean to break everything near them but do anyway. This one looked like it would do the job.Got halfway through assembly and could not find the bolts needed for the rest of the assembly. I looked everywhere, and finally looked for a phone number on the instructions. No luck. Ah well, going to have to wait to finish the job but the chair looks really good, especially for the price of just over $100.Started putting the pcs back into bubble wrap and then into the box and lo and behold, the bolts are on a display card, clearly labeled and stuck in the bottom curve of the chair back! Whoot!Ten minutes later, even with the dogs \"helping\", I'm sitting in this amazing, comfy chair and finishing my work day.One more thing - tilting it back for the first time, it seemed to get stuck in the semi-reclined position. Found out that leaning all the way back again unstuck it and now it's working fine.Wish I had gone with the footrest too. But this is a gem, and solid, too. Plus mesh all around so no ick this summer while working.",

                "reviewText": "It took me a long time to decide which chair I wanted. I looked at our local Staples and here on Amazon and I am very happy with my choice of this chair! This is the first chair that I've had that has a footrest. I like that the footrest matches the rest of the chair's material, unlike the other ones I've seen. The buttons on the sides that are for adjustment of the chair are also really convenient compared to the large ugly levers that most other chairs have. The headrest is nice too. When looking at the other reviews of chairs with a separate headrest, there were several that claimed to have broken easily. A really cool feature this chair has is the ability for the seat bottom to adjust in and out! I hadn't seen that before. The back has 3 different positions it will lock in and stay in place. It also lays way back so you could take a nap on it if you wanted to.One downside to this compared to others is that the lumbar isn't adjustable, but that's ok it's still comfortable. The armrests are hard but I will likely get covers for them, at least they go down enough for it to go under my desk.I am very happy with my purchase. I'm glad that I wasn't impulsive and did the research and found that there was a chair that met all my needs.",

                "reviewText": "Chair reviewFirst off, if you live in a metro area, this company uses FedEx. No matter what delivery instructions I make through Amazon or on FedEx's app, they are completely ignored and packages are left in an area that homeless people often piss.Now for the chair itself:I am a large man. I am 6' 5\", 400 lbs. I know that sounds like a lot but I am surprisingly well distributed if you're worried about my dimensions. I have sat in many office chairs from Staples and Best Buy having had worked for both at one point or another. Many of those chairs can be comfortable, even the cheapest of which, but my concern has always been the longevity. After having used this chair a week, that concern is overshadowed by the plethora of issues I have with this chair.The first problem that became apparent is the frame of the seat. The mesh envelopes a sturdy plastic frame that holds it taught and in place. This frame digs into the sides of my but and thighs. It is not immediately painful but after an 8 hour shift, it brings moderate pain like wearing boots all day that dig into your ankle. For another prospective on what size I am for this to affect me, I am large enough that I can feel that digging in my sides from maybe 10% of public chairs, but not enough that I can\u2019t sit on a plane or even need a seatbelt extension. Then there is the leaning mechanism of the chair. The first day, I was able to get the chair back to stand completely upright but have not been able to do it since. Having a chair with back support that I did not have to lean back in was important to me. It is disappointing that I have not been able to find that in this chair because of an already weak leaning mechanism.The last major issue with the chair is the wheels. They were nearly impossible to put into place and all but one has issues with swiveling. Because of this, I find it nearly impossible to coast around. Did I mention I worked for Staples? During my year there, I put together many chairs for demos and people who paid for assembly. This is the only time I have ever had an issue with brand new office chair wheels. One more minor issue: the leg rest is useless. I paid the extra $40 for it and it barely props up my long legs and feels very wobbly.Overall, I will be looking for a replacement and this chair is going to make its way back to Amazon soon.",
