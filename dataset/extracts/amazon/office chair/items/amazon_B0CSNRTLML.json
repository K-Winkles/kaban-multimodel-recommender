                "reviewText": "I got the light blue version without wheels. I'm using it by an antique sewing machine table that doubles as a computer desk. I wanted something without armrests as my spouse isn't careful when he spins the chair and leaves scratches from the armrests.I don't really sit criss cross that much, but, I like being able to sit sideways or bring a foot up and similarly fidget a bit while working at the computer. This is great for that. The fabric is sort of a coarse upholstery fabric, but it looks nice as pictured.Assembly was mostly easy, there was one challenging part. Pay careful attention that the plate you are screwing to the seat has the side labeled 'front' facing the section of the base labeled front. The difficult part is attaching the back of the chair to the seat of the chair. It seemed impossible to do. It looks like you can't push the cushions together close enough to line up the 4 screws. Instead, angle it a bit so you can just align the two top screws and start threading them in. As you tighten them a bit, that will get the two bottom screw holes aligned enough to get the screws in a couple turns. Then use the included tool to tighten the lower screws enough to bring the two parts together.Overall, it feels nice and sturdy. I'll update if it wears out early or something, but, in assembly nothing jumped out at me as being poorly made or anything. I feel like this is a good value at the $68 or so it was when I ordered it.",

It takes a few minutes, but after cutting open the box, the only tool needed--a hex wrench--is provided (it's a nice one, too). Male ego mandated that I assemble it on my own, but working with a partner would help.- Sturdy- ComfortableCon- Will I like the criss-cross style? I may have been spoiled by my previous chair having arm rests. We'll see!- I'm already worried about keeping this thing clean. Soft fabric, light colored, and the back is a blank slate for unwanted marks. Again--we'll see!",

Sitting cross-legged on standard chairs leads to sleeping limbs and a sore back - this chair fixes the issue. 4.3\" range of adjustable height and seat tilt are very nice. The upholstery evens cleans up nicely in the event of a \"happy little accident\" appearing on the chair instead of the canvas... She has reported significantly improved comfort (cushion) over the cushioned folding chair that she had been using. Good price point and I keep seeing coupons to drop the cost even lower - solid choice!",

                "reviewText": "You guys ... I could take a nap in this thing it's so wide. I love it! And the color is awesome. It looks almost like a denim blue so goes well with the neutral coloring of my office.I love that the chair is armless and wheelless. I use an unusually shaped table for my office desk (think squarish kitchen table of sorts) so a lot of the chairs with arms won't work because of the height. This works great. And without the wheels, I don't have to worry about it sliding around unnecessarily on the wooden floor.It seems great quality. Thick in all the right places. Sturdy. But also comfortable to sit for long periods of time. And there's plenty of room for my writing muse (my cat) to jump up here beside me.The assembly was super simple and good instructions. With one caveat: when you're attaching the top of the chair to the seat cushion, you're going to have to angle it to get those screws in. At first glance, you may think, \"this is not going to work,\" but I promise it does. And it's super great when you get the right angle.I love this chair. Very pleased. And it looks fantastic in the office.",

The most difficult part is putting the two pieces together because you need to push down and screw in. Definitely get someone to help you align for and easier time but it is definitely not necessary. Assembly is literally 4 steps, practically 3. It is comfortable. It is sturdy. Wish i could of gotten model with wheels.",
