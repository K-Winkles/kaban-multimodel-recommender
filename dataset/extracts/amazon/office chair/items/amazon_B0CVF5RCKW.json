I started out at 330lbs and am now 274lbs, and the chair has held up extremely well. Wheels roll smoothly without any warp. The cushion is comfortable, and the back is supported. I would not install the headrest, though, because it is a bit on the flimsy side (unlike everything else about this chair) and, outside of looks, serves no real function. But your choice here. The fabric, despite the light color, is super easy to keep clean with warm water and a sponge if need be.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice chair that was fairly easy to put together. The instructions were simple and the parts were easily labeled. The only issue I have with this chair is the lumbar support section. It protrudes out too far and I cannot move or adjust it. It pushes forward so far that I don't ever feel like I'm fully in the seat. I keep wanting to sit back in the chair but is no room for that. Lumbar support is great but some people want a milder lumbar section and I'm one of those. It's okay for short-time sitting but if I had to sit in that chair a full 8 hours I would be in pain since it is so uncomfortable for me. I gave this 4 stars because there is physically nothing wrong with the chair, it arrived as described and looks really nice with great material but it just feels too small for me since I can't sit \"back\" in the chair due to the size of the lumbar.",

It is a little narrow, so it is not good for the big and tall. Hubby needs to pull up the arms to sit in it, and he isn\u2019t a fan of the lower lumbar support. I do like the headrest, and it\u2019s and that the back is adjustable to lean back.",

I can't remember putting together another chair this quickly! It's also very sturdy and all of the pieces, while plastic, are high quality and made to last. The only things I didn't like are 1) the lumbar support is not height-adjustable (I removed it because it wasn't comfortable), and 2) the seat cushioning is thin (I added a chair cushion). Even with these two demerits, I wouldn't hesitate to buy this chair again. Recommended.",
