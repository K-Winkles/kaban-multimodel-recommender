                "reviewText": "The chair arrived in a timely manner-earlier than its expected delivery day. The box was quite light, and I was able to carry it into the house on my own. Upon opening the box, I saw that the chair was packaged with care and arrived in pristine condition. The assembly was easy and quite fast-it took about 15 minutes from start to finish. The most difficult part of the process was putting the fabric tubes over the armrests. All tools needed to complete the chair were included.I find the chair quite comfortable, but some might find it to be too firm. The back of the chair reaches to my shoulder blades (I'm 5'6 for reference), so neck and head support are lacking. The arm rests are a little too low for me to use comfortably and appear to be more decorative than functional. It can be adjusted up and down, and it does so with ease-it glides nicely in both directions. I can't attest to the quality of the wheels since my chair rests on carpet, but they appear to be of good quality.Overall, I would recommend this chair.",
