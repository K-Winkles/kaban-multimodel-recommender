                "reviewText": "I've sat in quite a few office chairs in my day. It's always difficult to find one that has the right amount of support with the right amount of comfort, and being able to lean back and relax for a bit is always a balancing act.Once we set up this office chair and gave it a test run, we were tempted to sleep in it! The cushion in the back and seat is so perfectly padded. It's not too firm and not too soft. I feel like the Three bears leaving this review, but it really is just right! I love that it comes with a lumbar support cushion. I throw that in behind me when I need a little extra support, but I find that I'm regularly leaving it on my lap and sort of cuddling it while I'm sitting at the desk.I don't think I've ever had an office chair that has a pull out foot rest! This feature is by far one of my favorites. It impresses anybody that sees it, and when it comes to being able to sit back and relax, it adds that extra layer of comfort you didn't realize you wanted until you have it.The chair itself was very easy to assemble. The pieces fit snugly together and there's no wiggle to any of the assembled areas. The material is very high quality, the stitching is extremely well done and I see this office chair lasting years. I highly recommend this for anybody looking for ergonomic support, Elegance and comfort!",

                "reviewText": "I already have a nice chair for my basement office but I have adult family members and friends visiting me in the office and looking and discussing items on the screens, and I had no place for them to sit for any length of time (just a lightweight bench)\u2026so I really could use a second office chair.It really needed to be solid because I am 6 feet and 250 pounds, and some visitors are a little taller and a little bit heavier.The chair assembly was pretty straightforward, although the instructions were packaged with the chair seat or back instead of at the top of the shipping carton so I ended up googling and finding some instructions that guided me with the wheel assembly\u2026and then I found the instructions for this specific chair.It would have been easier at a couple of points if I had an assistant (e.g., lining up holes and holding things while I inserted and tightened bolts), but I did manage to put it all together myself.In the end, I am pretty pleased with the chair. It is soft and comfortable and I am happy sitting on it while I work for hours and hours.My only observations, beyond the locating of the instructions as mentioned earlier, are:1. I find it very difficult to pull out the footrest using the material strap (it is much easier for me to reach down and hook a finger/thumb around the front corner of the metal bar and use that instead)2. It would be nice if the lumbar pillow had something like a Velcro strap that could be used to strap it in place (maybe a strap that can be run around the back and then the ends Velcro together) so it doesn\u2019t shift/slide3. I wish there was another adjustment: one that tilts the seat itself and then can be locked in place. The way it is now, especially when using the footrest, it seems to have a slight tilt forward so it feels like I might slide forward on the seat (I haven\u2019t yet, but it just gives me that feeling). I am more comfortable on a chair with an adjustment that lets me tilt the seat bottom back a bit so i feel like I am more securely in the chair. Keep in mind that the seat back can be leaned back and locked in place; I am talking about the seat bottom where my posterior lands when I sit down.To summarize, apart the feeling that my butt might slide forward, which may not be an issue for others but I, and another person who tried the chair said with out prompting, definitely felt, the chair is comfortable for long days working. The footrest is not something I have found myself wanting to use while working at my desk, but when relaxing and surfing the net, etc., it is a really nice feature.",

It is padded all around making it very comfortable sitting on it. The installation is easy and straightforward as per the instructions. It moves very well in any directions. The ergonomic design provides good support to your lumbar and back, especially there is an extra removable support pillow for lower back. The height adjustment function works very smoothly. The reclining office chair can change the angle of the seat back so you can completely relax on it. One of my favourite parts is the footrest. It adds extra comfort and is good for taking a nap. In addition, the headrest is also adjustable to adapt to people with different heights. Overall, if the price is acceptable to you, it would be one of the best choices for you.",
