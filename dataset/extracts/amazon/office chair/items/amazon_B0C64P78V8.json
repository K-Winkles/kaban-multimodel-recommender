Just by the look you can visibly see that the metal is thicker, the welds are more secure and it is all together heavier. The tilt lock is extremely strong compared to any and every chair I've had, I leaned backwards with all of my weight and it didn't budge (I weigh around 300). To be honest it caught me off guard. I'll come back if I have any issues in the next six months. First picture is the new one, second picture is the failure point of the first, also this will make your chair taller.",

However seeing this replacement part I decided to try fixing it. As you can see the weld on the original part had broken half way round so I suspect this was causing the lean. The hardest part of switching the base attachments was getting the gas lift cylinder out of the old. i ended up using a pipe wrench and a hammer! All is fixed now and the chair feels sturdier than it ever has before. Hopefully this will last many years!",
