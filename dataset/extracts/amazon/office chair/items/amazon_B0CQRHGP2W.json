It is also not very comfortable and you can feel the bars digging into your back, I\u2019m going to need to put a pad down to make it more comfortable on my back.",

Assembling the chair by myself was an easy job. I\u2019ve had it for a couple of weeks now, and I\u2019m very pleased with the comfort and sturdiness of this chair.",
