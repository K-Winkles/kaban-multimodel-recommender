                "reviewText": "Having had to sit in a chair (from a major manufacturer) that had its flaws but lasted about 6 years, this chair was a change for me. The biggest change was the lumbar support as I never had one before and I'm still getting used to it. As a reference, I am 6' tall and weigh about 200 pounds, so chair size was a concern for me when I did my shopping for a replacement. This chair seems a little small for a larger person BUT I sat in only one other chair for years so this may be an issue I just need to get used to. New shoes can feel odd at first too. I do agree the lumbar support seems to push a person forward and does somewhat restrict the length of the chair seat - about 3 inches of my legs, at my knees, do hang over without support but so far I have not experienced any discomfort. I have learned to sit flush against the seat back (VS slouching) which also maximizes use of the lumbar support which feels good but also odd as I never had the support before. Assembly was pretty easy - always a challenge to add the arms when doing it alone, but I managed. Everything else was VERY easy, and the instructions were helpful and provided enough information. The leather also seems of good quality but only time will tell. I do use the chair every day but never for more than about an hour at a time, but several times a day. The color is also nice - pleasant and nicer than bright white. I would suggest to Amazon however, that they increase the height of the seat back for us taller folk - right now it only comes to about my shoulders because I do not slouch, so resting my head against the back is impossible unless I slide my butt forward, which then offsets the use of the lumbar support. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase and have no regrets.",

                "reviewText": "I just received this chair yesterday. The star ratings are based on my first impressions and I'll update this review after I've had a chance to live with this chair for a while.So far, it's fairly impressive. It was boxed well and the unpacking simple. The instructions were clear (assuming a person is able to follow pictures that show how to assemble a thing). The necessary hardware was easily identified. The only bump in the road for me was that the instructions show a screwdriver-type tool to tighten the screws but the actual tool provided was an Allen wrench. I have arthritis in my hands so I would have preferred the tool that was shown. Not a reason to prevent someone from purchasing this chair, just my personal preference. It took me about 15 minutes to assemble the chair.It looks great! The floor in my office is ceramic tile and the wheels roll effortlessly over that surface. I also tried it over tight pile carpet. Rolled easily on that service as well. The seat is well padded as is the seatback. I'm 6', 220 lbs. The lumbar support feels very good and hits my lower back in the perfect spot for me. The arms swing up and down very smoothly. The controls for positioning the chair up and down and tilting the back takes some getting used to but once mastered (took about 30 seconds) work well.I sit at my desk several hours throughout the day. I'll be looking to see how well everything holds up in the coming weeks and will revisit this initial review. So far, it's yet another Amazon Essential item that appears to be an excellent value.UPDATE OCTOBER 14, 2020: Three weeks in and I'm very happy with this chair. The seat has now conformed to my butt and the back support continues to be excellent. I actually spend a lot more time watching TV in this chair than I did with my previous office chair. The only thing that will remain uncertain for a while is how long the bonded leather lasts. Not expecting a problem though as Amazon Essential stuff is pretty good.UPDATE: FEBRUARY 8, 2021 - Recent events have me sitting at my computer for 6-8 hours a day. THIS IS THE MOST COMFORTABLE OFFICE CHAIR I HAVE EVER HAD! If you happen to buy this chair I'm willing to bet that you won't be disappointed.",

Es una silla algo ancha, soy una persona delgada y mido 1.60, para mi tama\u00f1o realmente no es tan c\u00f3modo descansar los brazos en la silla ya que tendr\u00e1s que abrir mucho los brazos para recargarte bien, la mayor parte del tiempo prefiero dejarlos arriba2. en los brazos tiene dos costuras que rodean todo el borde y ese detalle me ha irritado el codo por la fricci\u00f3n, es realmente molesto ya que, si quieres recargarte no lo podr\u00e1s hacer por mucho tiempo o tendr\u00e1s la marca de la costura por todo el brazo, no importa si usas un su\u00e9ter la molestia se sientePor lo dem\u00e1s he de decir que se siente de buena calidad todo, el asiento es c\u00f3modo si vas a pasar muchas horas sentado como yo no tienes de que preocuparte en ese sentido, los brazos no me encantan, pero es una percepci\u00f3n muy personal, para ti puede que ese detalle no sea un problema. el respaldo se siente bien.",
