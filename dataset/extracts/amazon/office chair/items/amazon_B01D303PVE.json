I only weigh 145lbs, so a little disappointed in this. Ended up taking off most of the silver trim pieces, which made it somewhat quieter, but still creaks a bit.UPDATE: The chair has started to make more noise as time goes on. I have had it for about 6 months and it creaks whenever you recline or move around. Not terribly noisy, but annoying. More importantly, the mesh seat has cushions all round the edge (I suppose the mesh has to anchor somewhere). The front cushion seriously aggravates my IT bands such that I need to raise my feet off the ground using a platform. I'm not sure if everyone would have this problem, but I don't have this problem on traditional seats, so thought I would share.",

I needed that feature so that I could adjust the height without running into an issue of the arms hitting the desk. I'm very happy with the chair. It's comfortable enough for my 8-hour workday, offers lower back lumbar support, and allows me to adjust my chair to a proper height so that my neck isn't strained from looking up at my dual monitors at work. So from me, it is 5 stars.",
