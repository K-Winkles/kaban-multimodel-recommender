                "reviewText": "Good chair for any office. Handles average daily use.Got this chair in 2020, then bought another in 2021. Good cushions, good support in lower back. Tilt back feature is nice, and the lock back feature holds firm if you don't like to tilt backwards.The mesh fabric on the seat is strong, flexible, but somewhat slick and can cause some sliding forward.Legs and casters are sturdy. Chair is solid top to bottom, does not rattle, wobble side to side or sway. Casters roll easily on carpet or on plastic office floor mat.Arm rests are adjustable and hold their height positions without any vertical give / sliding or sudden collapses.The only functional idiosyncrasy is that the seat loses its height setting gradually over time. It's easy to adjust up and down, but seems the pneumatic slowly slides down ever so subtly over time until you realize you're about 1 to 2 inches lower than two weeks ago. So, have to readjust height every so often.If you're looking for a solid office chair with reliable standard features that will last, this is a good choice.",

                "reviewText": "Ended up buying a new versatable which was slightly taller then my old desk and my old executive chair just wasn't tall enough to sit properly, in addition it lacked good lumbar support. After hours of browsing amazon I finally decided on this chair. I heard HON was a dependable brand and although there wasn't as many reviews for this chair as others the reviews seemed more positive.This chair is extremely comfortable. I had spinal fusion surgery in the past so something with great lumbar support was a huge requirement. My back just seems to mold perfectly around this chair. Another plus is the seat cushion which is probably the most comfortable I have sat in a long time.Pros:-This thing goes high! I am 5.11 and at its tallest my feat can't touch the ground-Very comfortable lumbar and seat cushion-Tension control so people with different weights can adjust pneumatic hydraulics-Easy to put together-Very well made, my guess is this thing should hold up for a long timeCons:-The arms are adjustable vertically, however there is no horizontal adjustment. Keep this in mind if you are a heavier set person. The alternative would be to just take the arms off.-The tilt feature is a little stiff, but I don't use that anyway and may even loosen with time.Additional:-Comes packaged a little odd to say the least. When I first opened the box I honestly thought someone had already opened it jammed it back in and returned it or something. The adjustment lever was in another box with the handle ripping through and nothing was in sealed bags except for the wheels. After watching the video review here I realized that his was packaged the exact same way. I should note nothing was damaged nor would I be concerned about the way they are packing it, it was just odd to me..",

                "reviewText": "This chair seemed like a great deal for the price but after having it a while I am left with the feeling that you get what you pay for. It is firm and well built but it has some problems. First the good.Good: Mesh back to prevent sweating when its hot, soft cushion bottom which does a good job of muffling your farts to prevent embarrassing flatulence, adjustable arm rests, decent lumbar support, assembles easily.Bad: Arm rests are cupped so that if you lay your arms across the rests, it hurts because the rest is a hard plastic. The seat does not go down very far with the adjustment so people shorter than 5'5\" might not get their feet to touch the ground, the mesh on the seat cushion traps dirt and crumbs and its hard to get them out, and the thing that bothers me the most is that seat cushion is becoming bucket shaped and it is hard to slide my bottom against the back to keep my back supported on the support. Also, after assembly, I noticed the gap between the seat and the back support is uneven so poor design and manufacturing there.Its a good chair, just not great. If you want to save money its worth it but if you want something really good , spend more.",

Easy to assemble with the components clearly marked with the direction they should go in. Nice looking and well made non-leather product that is readily adjustable. Good fit for a tall person (of which I am). The seat material was a little rough on bare legs when sitting wearing shorts for the first month or so and also tends to collect crumbs in its many small indentations.Sep/17 - After two years one of the arm pads started cracking and pieces eventually broke off one side. Bought replacement pads recently from Amazon but unfortunately then found the pad screws are in so tight all I managed to do was strip a screw without getting the pad off.Jul/2018 - Replaced with a DXRacer Tank series computer gaming chair which will undoubtedly last far longer and is specifically suited to really tall people (though it took some work / study / bucks to make it really comfortable).",

At 6'3 the cushion barely covers 3/4th of my thighs.Arm rests barely raise - At maximum height my elbows are still a good 2 inches above even at 90 degrees. Once I start using a mouse and keyboard they may as well not exist at all.Very basic features - Without even being able to lock the tilt in a particular position you've only got two adjustment options: resistance-based free-floating tilt or perfectly straight.Overall this chair has the features typically seen in an 80 dollar office chair, and apart from the back support about the same level of comfort you would expect from one.Definitely returning - I got more comfort, better form fitting, and more adjustability out of the $168 chair 'CoolMesh Executive mid back' chair from Source Furniture.",
