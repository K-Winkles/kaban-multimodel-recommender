I am a small person (5'3\", 100 lbs.) and this chair is a perfect fit for me, something that here to now has been impossible for me to find. As other reviewers have stated, it was easy to assemble (I won't say \"super easy\" but easy). I had it put together in 2 hours or less and I am an elderly woman. The assembly instructions were clear, well-written (good, grammatically correct English), and easy to follow. The chair is very comfortable, slides and moves about easily, with adjustable arm rests (arm rests can be put up so you can slide it under the desk or table). Pleasing, attractice, well-made product in every respect. Unbeatable value for the price. Shipping and delivery was quick. I give it 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "Don't buy a gaming chair. Buy an office chair. Buy this chair. It's good quality and cheap for what you get. But doesn't feel cheap. Extremely easy to put together, literally don't even need to read the instructions. It rolls, rocks and spins so nicely. You can lock it in when gaming so you can relax your body and the back will stay put. Its perfect for me. I didn't want to spend $250 on a uncomfortable chair that makes me feel like I'm in a race car. Not necessary when you can get a good chair that will do the job and looks nice. One thing I will say though, if you sit for a long time in it, your tush will hurt. It's decently padded and feels totally fine for a while, but eventually you will feel it in your tailbone. I am gaming for like 2-5 hours at a time though, so.... not everyone will have that issue. But definitely invest in a chair cushion. I have the everlasting comfort one, also from Amazon lol. That isn't enough of a deal breaker for me though, I would still recommend this chair. It's great.",

                "reviewText": "Wow, at last there is a comfortable desk chair! I work long hours every day at the computer, and this chair is wonderful. The seat is soft enough without being too soft, it's easy to raise up and down, and the support for my back is perfect. The casters roll just right, however, that was the only part of assembly that was difficult. The casters have to be pushed into the chair frame and were very difficult to push far enough in that they were all even with each other and not fall out. There's a cross shape on the casters, I finally figured out that if you insert the casters and then push down on the shaped part it goes in easier, but it's still hard to do. Other than that, assembly was a breeze and it only took about an hour. I'm glad I found this chair and got it at a good price!",

                "reviewText": "This is a very nice rotating office chair and does a good job. First of all the color is exactly what was expected - was actually looking for gray color and it looks good and matches the walls of the room where I have placed this.The assembly was straightforward and didn't take much time - about 15-20 mins. The instruction manual included all the relevant details. There were extra nuts and bolts also provided and that also helped immensely as I did lose one bolt at the time of installation.Once installed, the chair is reasonably comfortable and works well. You really have to look at the price here and see what this offers as compared to other more expensive chairs. Two areas where I can see some compromises here are - one, the arms of the chair are not extensible which means that they don't move up / down and cannot be adjusted. The arms also don't have any cushion and therefore when your elbows are resting on the arm, it won't provide the same level of comfort. The other limitation is that this chair doesn't have as good lumbar support as needed. Normally chairs have a component that goes from the backside and your lower back rests on this. This chair doesn't have it. I do feel that within the price, this could have been included.Other than above, the materials used to construct this chair are all good and it does work quite well. It is able to take decent amount of weight and the wheels move well on wooden floor and carpets too. So overall good chair and gets a good rating too given the value it offers for the price.",

Instructions are super easy to follow and was easy to construct by myself. The wheels roll smoothly on my wooden floors and really makes my at home workplace feel much more comfortable, but not too comfortable as I get really sleepy (my small workplace is in my bedroom. Poor choice of placement by me as the temptation to fall asleep is consistent).",
