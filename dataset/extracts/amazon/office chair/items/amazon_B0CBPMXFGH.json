It provides zero lower back support and the length of the seat is too long for my very avg sized legs which pulls my lower back away from the back of the chair. Even if I really pull the back of my knees against the seat and try to get my back to touch the backrest, it\u2019s still really crappy lower back support. Should have gotten a hermann miller chair.",
