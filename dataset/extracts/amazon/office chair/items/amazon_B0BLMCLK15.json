But I was able to get in contact with company by via email and was compensated for the damage parts. Even though the chair had damage parts it was still easily to put together. Also I notices the Holludle office chair was lot more confrontable then my older Ikea chair which I bought 9 years ago and costed me 300 at the time. Making this Holludle chair a big upgrade for me snice my Ikea chair was about to go on me with its cushions gone and armrest about fall off and only costing about double the price. I'm not happy about how the Holludle chair came to me, but I'm happy with how Holludle was able to resolve my issues pretty quickly. The only reason I pick out this chair over the others is because the adjustability of chair and movable backrest when turning side to side. Comfortability is pretty high for chair like this coming at such a good price point.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this to replace a nice large leather (faux) from S**m's a few years ago - very large and comfortable, but a bit awkward in my tight corner of my Office at home. And a bit used. This chair is a bit smaller sized and fits better at my desk. Comfortable? Pretty good, but a hard (firm?) seat (well, compared to last one), but it's OK. Pads on the armrests would have been nice, but that's a very minor point. Armrest adjustments OK, but I will get them to where I want and then leave them. Ditto on the headrest. Seat is OK for a 6-footer and i weigh about 180 lbs. (I hate when I read reviews and I don't know the size of the reviewer!) Wide base with 6 rollers. Last chair was a smaller base but had wood and metal with 5 rollers. Other 'adjusties' (up-and-down, in-and-out, and back-and-forth) and such seem OK...so far. The 'put-together' was simple enough and took an hour and a cup of coffee or two. I didn't bother to see the videos...just looked at the pictures that came with the screws and such. Simple enough. So, for about $160 or so (I got $50 off the $209.99 price on 14 Dec 23, but see it for $164.98 today, just a week later), it's a fair priced chair. I would congratulate the firm on the packing (good), and the assembly (simple enough), and the quick shipping time before Xmas was appreciated. I would recommend this product and vendor. Thanks, Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "I work from home full time and have gotten a lot of use out of this chair. It's quite comfortable. It's sturdy enough. The arm rests are great for my height. It adapts perfectly to my Flexispot sit/stand desk. I bought the chair in white and I really dig the style. I'm a decent sized guy at 6'1\" 220 lbs. The chair works perfectly and the headrest is optional, so I took it off. The wheels had really slowed down and been struggling, but they're standard wheels, so I popped them off and ordered replacements. The chair is now better than ever at about 6 months of consistent use.",

This chair is very easy to assemble, not too heavy. It's comfortable and I immediately noticed a HUGE difference in back support upon trying it out compared to my old chair. I'm a streamer so I spend basically 24/7 at my desk and hopefully this'll last me a long while. I say you should definitely go for it if you're switching from a gamer chair cause you'll notice the difference. That being said, I am 5'6 and around a hundred pounds, the size is perfect for me but I wouldn't purchase it if you're taller.",

Abriendo el paquete y revisando todas las piezas me di cuenta que solo fue un rasp\u00f3n derivado del traslado que afecta solo lo est\u00e9tico (muy poco) y no lo funcional por lo que dado el tiempo de entrega que fue de 15 d\u00edas y que personalmente no aguantaba la anterior silla, de ido quedarmela y no devolverla, ni pedir reembolso (lo hable tambi\u00e9n con el vendedor y muy amable me ofreci\u00f3 el reembolso pero yo no lo quise).Por otra parte en lo funcional la silla es totalmente c\u00f3moda y como tambi\u00e9n comentan hay veces que la cabecera no la uso porque si queda un poco atr\u00e1s, pero es cuesti\u00f3n de acostumbrarse tambi\u00e9n. El giro, la reclinaci\u00f3n, los ajustes de reposabrazos, el ajuste del asiento y la altura son muy buenos, ideoneos para trabajar Home Office, llevo ya 15 d\u00edas con ella y no e sentido dolor cervical, al contrario se me fue el que ten\u00eda con la anterior silla, paso alrededor de 10 horas max. en la silla por mi trabajo y a parte mi tiempo libre y en ning\u00fan momento sientes cansancio de la silla o dolor lumbar/cervical.La recomiendo 100% si la buscan para Home Office o a fin de cuentas pasar mucho tiempo sentado, ya que no sientes tampoco calor o fr\u00edo por la malla del respaldo la cu\u00e1l tambi\u00e9n es muy resistente y apoya tambi\u00e9n mucho el ajuste lumbar.Otro aspecto extra es que la silla es un poco m\u00e1s grande que yo, mido 1.72 y peso 62 kg entonces siento que me sobra silla pero nada que todos los ajustes combinados no puedan resolver. Y por otra parte la silla es pesada ya que est\u00e1 hecha de muy buenos materiales.Le puse 4 estrellas solamente por el aspecto de la paqueter\u00eda pero en funcionalidad es un 10.",

Le dossier adaptable offre un soutien parfait \u00e0 ma colonne vert\u00e9brale, et les accoudoirs 4D permettent une personnalisation ultime pour un confort optimal.J'appr\u00e9cie particuli\u00e8rement la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9gler la profondeur d'assise selon mes pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences, ce qui la rend id\u00e9ale pour des sessions de travail prolong\u00e9es.

La chaise est solide, les mat\u00e9riaux sont durables, et l'assemblage a \u00e9t\u00e9 facile.
