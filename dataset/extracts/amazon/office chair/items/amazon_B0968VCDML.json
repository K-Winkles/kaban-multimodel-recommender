                "reviewText": "This chair offers a lot of lumbar support which I needed. The armrests are smooth which is comfortable, but when I put my arms on them, the back of my arms touch the back of the seat. The seat is a little rough, so it is uncomfortable. I live in a hot climate and wanted a mesh seat, as well as, a mesh back. The mesh is a bit rough or grabby. I do feel like I am either getting used to it or my clothing fibers are sticking to it and making it softer. It isn't so bad for my shirts, but when I wear shorts, my skin is not a fan of the mesh. I have resorted to putting a hand towel right where my legs touch. Not what I really wanted to have to do, but because the mesh is so grabby, the towel stays in place, so it is working out. I hope that I get used to the mesh or it gets softer with time. The headrest is nice for me, but I am only 5'5\". I had a much taller friend use it and he could not get the headrest to workout for him. A chair is not easy to buy online, but I am mostly satisfied with it.",

                "reviewText": "It arrived quickly. My husband put it together and said it was easy. I got home and saw it waiting for me. The first sit... oh my, very comfortable. The back support is on point. The head rest is adjustable and when sitting back to relax it's so great. One month later I am still happy with my chair. The chair works for my size I'm 5'6\" 200 lbs wide hips and I have wiggle room. The mesh design is comfortable for long periods of time. I work 10hrs a day from home and no pain from sitting. The chair I had BEFORE this one was made with cushion seating and it made my bottom hurt after an hour or so. I remember using extra pillows to Mt old chair just to get me through the day. Now that I have this chair.... Game changer! The built in suit hanger in the back is a cool feature too.",

                "reviewText": "The chair was easy to assemble, instructions were hidden under the seat. Chair had tons of support it felt like the 1500$ Herman Miller ergo chair we use at the office but after a month of I would say 6 hours a day during the week and 10 hour sessions during the weekend the chair is showing some wear on the slack of the material. It still supports but not like it once did but I still feel comfortable after a long day. I am 6'1 and weigh 210lbs so I do cover about 80% of the weight limit.",

During Covid my company allowed me to bring their very expensive ergonomic office chair home, but as we went back to the office on a hybrid schedule we had to return all company equipment. I bought this chair for my home office and am very pleased with it. Its comfortable, sturdy and the mesh back and seat helps keep me cool. I would definitely recommend it.",
