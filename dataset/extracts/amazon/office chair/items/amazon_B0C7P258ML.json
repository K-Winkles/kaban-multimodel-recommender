                "reviewText": "TLDR: Great chair for the price, highly recommend a few DIY fixes when assembling however.I have used the chair for the last three months, and can say for the price it's definitely a great chair. For about $130-$160 the chair has a lot of great features. The lumbar support is really nice and easy to adjust, the headrest is really good, the recline is easy to use and locks very nicely, the backrest feels really good and has not gotten loose on me, and the arm rests have a lot adjustability. I've known others who use chairs that are around $300-$500 and they say they actually prefer this one over theirs.There are a couple of problems I've had though. The seat can get uncomfortable, so I personally use a thin firm cushion that helps me sit in the chair for hours at a time. The recline on the chair is nice, however the adjustment for the force to sit back in the chair a bit more is quite difficult to use, and is not very intuitive on which direction is for strengthening the force for sitting back more, or lightening the load of it. The arm rests do have a fair bit of adjustability, however they do feel a bit too firm, and can cause some discomfort to my elbows at times. I do think adding a little bit extra padding from factory wouldn't add to the cost of manufacturing the chair very much, and if that is the case I would personally like some more padding in the arm rests.It's quite simple to assemble compared to other chairs I've had, however there are a few DIY fixes I highly recommend when assembling it. First, the cover that goes over where the chair legs and hydraulic lift for raising and lowering the chair meets will rattle a lot when moving the chair. What I did was use the foam from shipping, and cut a shape that will go on the underside of the cover so it does not rattle anymore. Second, after a month or so, I noticed a screw that had fallen off the chair, and the chair would creek a lot. When taking a look I noticed all the screws had backed out a considerable amount, and some were almost about to fall off as well. I ended up redoing all the screws with blue Loctite, and ever since all the screws have been firmly in place on the chair.Overall, even with a few complaints, the chair is definitely pretty good, and is great when factoring in the price. I highly recommend it if you're looking for an office chair in this price point.",

                "reviewText": "For what I paid for the chair, and for any chair under $200, this thing is WAY higher quality than I expected. Arms are very adjustable in a lot of ways, and has actual quality cushioning. Seat fabric also seems quite nice and less likely to break and fray. Only downside is that it's really not for leaning back at all - when it's in the locked position, you really are pretty straight up. I also remove the headrest as it was pushing my neck too far forward, but I have neck problems, so don't go by me. (It looks fine without the headrest, just treat it as a bonus.)",

                "reviewText": "Simple review here, the chair was easy to assemble and came in perfect condition. The seat is a bit stiff, but I assume with time it will loosen. The armrests are also pretty stiff, but I may not end up using them very often since I\u2019ll rest my arms on my desk. Nothing here that would, at this point, take away from the rating.It feels very sturdy and as long as you don\u2019t plan on body slamming into it, it should last a long time. I\u2019m 215 lbs, so time will tell how harsh the weight is on the chair\u2019s parts.For my height, the headrest is a bit low, but it works for the few times that I may actually be laying my head back on it (pretty seldom, I imagine).The ergonomic settings are perfectly serviceable, nothing \u201dluxury\u201d but everything worked as advertised. As far as pictures, it looks exactly like it does in the ad, nothing of note to remark on.I\u2019ll update the review as time goes on, this chair was assembled on 12 January, 2024.",

La conoc\u00ed a trav\u00e9s del Canal de Youtube Btod donde analizan sillas ergon\u00f3micas y pensaba que me iba a decepcionar, pero todo lo contrario. Los diferentes ajustes ergon\u00f3micos, algunos propios de un segmento m\u00e1s caro, hace que puedas ajustar la misma a tus formas sin problema, es razonablemente sencilla de montar, no es necesario que llames a nadie para que te la monte, en 20 0 30 min, puedes estar sentado c\u00f3modamente en ella, ahora a esperar que dure.\u00bfHay sillas mejores? Rotundamente s\u00ed, Herman Miller Aeron o Embody, Haworth Fern etc.. Estas dispuesto a pagar 1000\u20ac por ellas, me lo tendr\u00eda que pensar mucho...Muy buena compra...Saludos.",
