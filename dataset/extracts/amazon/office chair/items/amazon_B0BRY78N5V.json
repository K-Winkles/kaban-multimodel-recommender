It truly makes a significant difference in my working day, spent in a chair for hours at a time. The pump action for adjusting the height of the chair is smooth and problem-free. I like the lumbar support, it is a rigid part of the chair that can be slid up and down depending on where you would prefer to have additional support. The chair wheels and 360-degree swivel are perfect and smooth. Overall, the chair looks good, and I am so impressed by the seat cushion. For the price, it offers great quality, good workmanship, and can be adjusted in various ways, making it suitable for all.",

Black theme works nicely with my other stuff. Chair is quiet (doesn\u2019t squeak) and rolls, pivots, and rocks smoothly. The mesh back keeps everything cool. The size of the butt part is deep enough to sit comfortably. My only wish would be for the padding on the butt part to be a touch thicker. It only ever becomes an issue after about 8-9 hours of constant sitting. Happens from time-to-time, but not enough that it would bother me",

The directions were easy enough to follow therefore I had no trouble assembling this chair. In terms of size and fit it works well in an office setting. It is elegant and stylish. The quality of the material seems pretty good and the armrests are very comfortable. It completely supports my back. It\u2019s a very comfortable chair with a good price. I am very happy that I bought this chair for my office.",

                "reviewText": "Pros: Seat is comfortable & the seat back is cool. There is an adjustable lumbar support on the seat back. Arm rests are nicely padded, and I really like their fold back feature. They are at a comfortable height for me. The chair rolls smoothly, and the legs are long & distribute the weight of the chair on the floor more evenly.Cons: The seat is too short, and you cannot adjust the depth of the seat back, i.e., move it further back from the seat, to compensate. You cannot lock the tilt feature in place, and the arm rests are fixed & can't be raised or lowered.But assembly is the very worst I've encountered! None of the surfaces readily align, and some of the pieces are heavy (for me), and the large ones are very awkward to handle. I recommend having 2 people do this, with one holding the parts in position. Also, step 3 being particularly difficult for me, I went back and disassembled the parts in step 2. I HIGHLY recommend you do step 3 before step 2, as it makes both easier, esp step 2.",

                "reviewText": "I took a plunge on this chair after seeing the limited number of reviews, however which were all extremely positive. Upon receiving the chair, the seat cushion had slightly misaligned bottom screw holes which made it incredibly difficult to attach to the backrest. After struggling for some time I wasn\u2019t able to get the screws in completely and this resulted in an unsturdy chair. I emailed the seller support and they promptly shipped me a whole new chair box. I only needed the new seat, which worked fine with my existing parts. They also allowed me to send back the rest of the new chair parts and old seat (to minimize eco waste). The final chair setup is very comfortable and seems high quality. I\u2019ve sat it in for many hours daily about a week now and no issues yet. FYI - I found it easier during setup to swap Steps 3 and 2, but YMMV.",
