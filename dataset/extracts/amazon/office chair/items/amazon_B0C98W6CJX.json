The arms are adjustable in height and they were able to go low enough to push the chair under her low desk. After three weeks of use it has held up as new. The wheels are a bit tight so it doesn\u2019t roll as easily as I would like on the hardwood floor, but it doesn\u2019t bother my daughter. Overall happy with the chair.",
