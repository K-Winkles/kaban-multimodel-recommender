It was organized, neat and EVERY piece was wrapped for protection. I wish I had taken a picture of it in the box. The even send a small, organized tool and screw set with spare pieces just in case. The instructions were SUPER clear and the chair is so sturdy, heavy and well crafted. I say that as I am sitting in it. I LOVE this chair already. It's so soft and the green color OMG! Definitely feels like an executive chair with some modern flair. This was an amazing buy!",

                "reviewText": "okay let me start off by saying i was pleasantly surprised. i work from home and am beyond picky. due to a previous surgery at my tailbone and recent lower back pain due to my last chair, i needed something new. this was the second chair i purchased to try and replace my old one, and it\u2019s a keeper. (tried a kneeling chair and it just didn\u2019t cut it).pros: comfortable. wide seat. functional (and adjustable) lumbar. flip up armrests. gas powered height adjustment. beautiful color. smooth fabric. quick build time (and 1-person build friendly).cons: the lumbar mesh is NEON green in person & doesn\u2019t match lol. can\u2019t lean back. no headrest. no footrest. a little tall for me (5\u20193\u201d) but i can buy a footrest.overall this is a winner for me! i\u2019m very happy and look forward to having this chair around awhile.",

                "reviewText": "Assembly: I was able to assemble it myself in about 45 minutes. The back was a bit tricky to line up with the armrests, but had I had someone help me it would have been easier. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. The bolts are neatly packaged and there is one spare for each included, which I did not have to use as all components were present. 5/5 for ease of assembly.Quality: The wheel base, gas lift, and seat plate are all metal and sturdy. The castors are easy to install, however, they are plastic and rattle somewhat. I also find it harder to roll around in than my previous office chair. The velvet material is soft and free of rips or staining. There are no loose threads in the stitching. The rock/tilt feature is smooth and quiet. The armrests are easy to adjust and stay put. in both positions. 3.5/5 for quality; I would give it a higher rating if the castors were higher quality. They can be removed easily so I may just replace them. It is quality for the price point!Comfort: The chair is supportive and comfortable and offers decent lumbar support. The high back is tall enough to rest my head on when leaning back. The seat is wide enough to sit cross-legged, especially with the adjustable armrests. The armrests could be a bit longer toward the back, but that is just my preference. 4.5/5 for comfort.",

I would still say it is worth the money and when I need to replace it I will likely buy the same chair again. I estimate I will need to buy a new one in the next year. So I estimate the chair to last about 18 months- 2 years and it is used M-F every week for work.",

The cushion is nice and the seat is large enough that I can sit comfortably with room on either side (I'm 5ft6in 190lb). The circle in the chair back adjusts and the chair also can lean back a good deal, keep in mind it won't stay back if you move though.",

When box arrived (just before Christmas), box was labeled as a white chair. When I contacted customer service, they responded with in 24 hours. Had to communicate back and forth a couple of times, and each time they responded quickly. (Even over Christmas holiday) They were sending me a prepaid FedEx return label, but wanted to see that chair was packed well for shipping. I had not opened the box because it said it was white. When I opened it to take picture for them, chair inside was actually beige. Packaging mistake, yes, but customer service was quick and willing to rectify what I thought was wrong chair.Also, chair is extremely sturdy and easy to assemble.",
