                "reviewText": "Took me about ten minutes to assemble and is almost identical to the one my husband bought at a local office supply store for $200, except this one has more padding in the seat and has more color options. Should he decide to replace his chair, we'll get him one if these in red. The shipping box took a beating, but the items were packed well enough to only sustain minor scuffs. It also took UPS 2 days to deliver when shipping time was predicted to be 7 days, so that was cool. I can see how some people might assemble it incorrectly and get the tilting forward issue, but if you find it tipping forward look at the directions again. You want the round knob at the front and the height adjustment handle at the back on this piece. Also, when assembling any piece of furniture with multiple holes in one part, start the screws, get them most of the way in but still loose. Don't tighten them fully until all of the screws are almost all of the way in. Otherwise you can have mismatched holes that make it hard to get the remaining screws in and you'll have to loosen them to get things lined up. Make sure they are all tightened before sitting in it, otherwise it will fall apart in time. This is probably the 40th chair like this I have assembled and it only took me ten minutes because my cat got involved. Also, I highly recommend you make sure all parts are counted before starting assembly, large and small. It can be quite frustrating if you get 9 screws when you need 10 but you figure it out when you can't find the last one. In this case, they provided 11 of the longer screw when you only need 10, and 5 of the shorter ones when you need 4. Extra parts are nice in case you break or strip a screw out or happen to lose one, I always save them in case I need them for future pieces. Also, never use heavy duty power tools on this kind of stuff, you'll just strip out the screws and maybe break the chair. It comes with the only tool you need anyway, a nice little hex wrench that even my arthritic hands could hold and turn. Just some tips if you aren't as practiced at assembling this kind of stuff.",

                "reviewText": "First off the chair arrived in half the time it stated for shipping - which I was happy about. Once assembled (easy), I could tell right away that this chair was far more comfortable than my previous one. The seat foam is soft but still supportive. The back gives goo lumbar support. The entire thing feels sturdy enough even when I lean back. I'm 240 lbs, BTW. Finally, I almost didn't purchase this because of all the reviews that said it \"leans forward\" or \"pitches forward\" negative reviews. However, a couple of the pictures in these reviews clearly shows that they have installed the seat backwards on the hardware. Don't let those deter you from this purchase. The pictures in the instructions clearly show they tensioner toward the front of the seat and the adjustment lever on the right side. Those with complaints about the seat \"leaning forward\" have it on backwards (with the tensioner in the back and the lever to the left).",

There is no padding on the back, it\u2019s a mesh net type material and I have to put a small pillow on the back for comfort when leaning back in the chair. The screw to attach the arm of the chair on doesn\u2019t screw in and the handle comes off easily.",

My other chair was much sturdier, and the back went back a few inches if you leaned back....this one doesn't. But hey, my other one cost 180.00, this one was 60.... so guess you get what you pay for.... sometimes...lol. Pretty color tho, I got purple.",
