The main reason I selected it was for the flip-up armrests. My home office is small (a bedroom), and I have limited space between the desk and the bed. This chair has been great thus far. The seat is comfortable to sit on for several hours at a time, and the mesh on the back makes it breathable. The chair has an adjustable back that can be adjusted to rock back and forth. The flip-up armrests let me push well into the desk after I am done working, thus giving me more space. The chair's height can be adjusted to accommodate short and tall people (I am 5ft 2in, and my husband is 6ft). I am the primary user, and having a chair that allows my feet to rest on the floor is great. Although I got this as a vine product, I consider the price to be excellent for the quality and versatility you will get.",

My husband has even enjoyed it for gaming (it\u2019s not a gaming chair, but he was using the couch before) and says it\u2019s a nice chair! The seat itself isn\u2019t overly padded, but the backrest is mesh and the chair is averagely comfortable. Setup was super easy, and you didn\u2019t need any extra tools besides what came in the packaging (I definitely need this, because we don\u2019t have any fancy tools at our house). It was quick to put together, and the directions were simple and straightforward. Plus you can adjust how much the chair rocks, and I like my chairs to easily sway back and forth. Good chair, would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "This office chair is surprisingly comfortable for such a light chair. This chair is not meant to be an executive chair. This chair is designed for the active desk worker that needs comfort and mobility.The assembly took a bit longer than I expected but I was in a confined space.My biggest concern is the long-term durability of this chair. I have this concern with almost every office chair I have bought and assembled. Chairs start off well but over time, chairs start showing their weaknesses. And eventually, I have to discard the chair for one reason or another.I am 215lb. I tend to think that most chairs made today are not going to last super long if you are well over 200lb. It is just natural the chair will eventually weaken when you have a lot of weight on it vs. a smaller, lighter person sitting on it.It is a good chair and I am happy to have it. I simply think that based on the feel of the build material, the assembly, and my heavier weight, I expect this chair will eventually weaken.",

The fidgety workers will be happy to know this has the \u201crocking\u201d option. The arms on the chair lift up so that you can roll this into your desk when not in use. It height adjusts easily without any issues. I can drink my coffee then use the rocking option while working. It\u2019s quite satisfying to say the least. I\u2019m happy with it so far.",

Decent for the price range, and certainly recommended one for home office usage!",
