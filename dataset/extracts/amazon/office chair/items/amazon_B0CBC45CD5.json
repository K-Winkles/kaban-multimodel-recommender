                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I spent about a week researching office chairs before deciding to purchase this one. This chair stood out to me because of the white stitch pattern. I've been using this for a little over a week and this is by far one of the most comfortable chairs I could find. I am on the big and tall side so the chair being able to handle up to 300lbs is a very nice plus. Also, the back seat is high enough for my head to rest on. It has a reclining pin and lock so you can tilt the chair back when relaxing and the arm rests have leather cushioning and can be retracted upward. Assembly took about 45 minutes to an hour and all the tools I needed were included in the packaging. I will say however assembly is much easier with 2 people. It can be done with one, but the arm rests can be a pain to align with the seat.Pros:1. This chair is plus size friendly and has comfortable leather seating.2. The assembly is quick with two people and doable with one.3. It comes with all the tools you need plus some extras.4. Price is reasonable for what you get.5. Has a reclining feature and adjustable height level.Cons:1. The chair seat is a little low and does not go up that high.2. If you don't screw in the arm rests correctly the alignment will be off causing an unleveled seat.3. It's a little difficult to move around on the chair wheels.",

Assembly was straight forward, took about 15 minutes to align screws and stuff together. the part that takes longest is attaching arms to the back and seat because they all have to align (it's what holds everything together in shape). I dislike the fact that one armrest ends up sitting higher than the other after assembly; they're not perfectly aligned. The build quality though is not that good. I can already see some of the decorative stitching starting to fray and I've only had it for a few days. In these few days also the tensioner system broke as well, so I can not longer adjust the stiffness of the rocking motion of the chair, it's always loose now.",

                "reviewText": "So far, quite happy with this purchase. Product quality is good, as shown in the listing photos. Very comfortable and well suited for a larger person. The chair only has height adjustment but the neutral position of the seat angle fits me nicely. I tried numerous other chairs at Staples, Ikea, etc. and then ordered this based on the appearance. I find it more comfortable than any of the gaming chairs which seem to be the style favoured by the other retailers. The only small issue is the bolt holes on the chair back and bottom were slightly angled so getting the bolts to go in without stripping was a bit of a challenge. Not a big deal if you have any mechanical experience but potentially a problem if this is the first item you try to assemble.Time will tell how well this lasts but initial impressions are very good.",
