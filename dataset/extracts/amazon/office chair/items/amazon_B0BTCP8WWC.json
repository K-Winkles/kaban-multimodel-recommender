It is very comfortable and was easy to assemble but I am so pissed that no warning was attached to inform me that everything rubs off on the fabric. Now what was supposed to be a beautiful pink office chair looks darn near black because I didn't realize that my dark clothes were going to rub off on it. I am more upset that contacting the company seems to be the hardest thing to do. I can't find a phone number or email address. The product comes with a one year warranty but I don't even know how to tap into that. It is very frustrating and now I have to find another chair because it no longer matches the decor. Ugh!",
