                "reviewText": "I have been needing a new office chair for a long time now. My husband told me to get a new one after he sat in the old offender. The new chair came in and it took him about 8 minutes to put together. No tools needed for him at least. The seat is nice and plush and cushiony. The material is soft and easily cleaned with a damp cloth. The back rest tilts back some when you are sitting in it and that is great. It is also easily wiped down with a damp cloth for cleaning. The levers to adjust the height level are within reach on the right hand side and not in the way if the functionality of the chair the way some are. Its tucked close by the stem of the chair which I think is good. My old chair the lever was just put there and I would hit it with my leg or foot sometimes and that irritated me. The spin test was 10 out of 10 lol. The gray color is very nice and soft. Very nice chair for the price.",

                "reviewText": "I love the way this chair was designed, and the fact that it's made durably and has cast Wheels that glide across the floor effortlessly. It was super easy to assemble. We were able to do so without even having to use instructions in about 10 minutes. Most of the parts actually snap together. This is by far the most comfortable computer chair I have ever experienced! It has a back that has a rocking or swivel motion and is also made for people with back trouble in order to relieve pain associated with sitting for long periods of time and back pain from office work altogether. It has an adjuster in the in the base so that you can adjust and customize the height to fit your preferences. The armrest on this chair are extremely comfortable and are wide. The seat of this chair is super comfortable and seems to be made for people of all sizes due to the fact that it's got plenty of hip area, wide armrest, and backrest adjustable. Definitely one of the nicest office chairs I've ever experienced!",

                "reviewText": "First off, this is the easiest chair to assemble that I have ever purchased. Second, it is lightweight and maneuvers easily with little effort.There are no tools required to assemble, everything just slots of clicks together with some throw levers for tension on the arm rests.Speaking of arm rests... what is the deal with their height? They can be adjusted in and out to accommodate different widths of users, but they can not be adjusted up and down so you are actually able to rest your arms. My arms are about 4 inches to high to be able to rest them. Or are the arm rests 4 inches too low?The wheels maneuver easily on carpet, hardwood, and a floor mat. The seat height can be adjusted via a lever and has a good amount of adjustment.The seat back is well vented and was very comfortable after 9 hours of sitting today.The seat itself is also very padded and comfortable.Overall, this is a great chair and would have been five stars if it had adjustable arm rests (up and down) to accommodate my arm height.",

As you can see, there are very few pieces to put together and everything snaps together. It literally went from the box to fully assembled in 7 minutes. One thing that cost us about a minute, when putting in the wheels don't try to just shove them in, they will resist you. Instead wiggle them as you apply pressure, and they pop right into place.The finished chair is solid and comfortable. It is easy to adjust the spacing of the armrests and height, and both setting lock securely.My wife is finding it much more comfortable than her old chair and her posture is better since she can set the height to match the computer table.",
