Assembly was fairly easy there were a few steps that were a bit confusing but for the most part was simple to understand. The fabric of this gaming chair is not like other leathery chairs where it's peeling apart within months of being used. The headrest and lumbar pillows are very supportive. I wasn't exactly looking for a footrest within my chair but it's a great added bonus. All and all this chair is really good quality and a really nice chair if your like me and sit at your desk for a long time. Good quality chair for a great price would buy again \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

                "reviewText": "I'm really trying to like this company and it's product but the fact of the matter is that I assembled the chair (which is of great quality) but was not given a left arm rest and I just cannot get consistent enough communication from/with them, despite calling & emailing multiple times.All I need is a left arm rest that should have come with the chair in the first place. Make it happenEdit: I'm getting communication from the manufacturer now. Seems like the delay was due to Chinese new year, I've updated my review to 3 stars accordingly",

                "reviewText": "This chair for the price is amazing. It was extremely easy to assemble it and the instructions were straight forward and east to understand. It comes with the only tool you need to build it and it's not cheap either. They provide you with an allen wrench that perfectly works for all of the screws provided. Not to mention that everything is labeled perfectly, and all of the small parts (screws, caps, and nuts) were kept inside of this plastic sealed piece of cardboard. So there is no way for any of the small pieces to get lost, it even had extras!For my first time building a chair it was smooth sailing from start to finish. Not even talking about how comfortable and supportive this chair is as well. The upholstery they used is of a good quality as well and doesn't smell funny either like some do. I have no gripes with the chair, but something that somebody might have a gripe with is the lack of support between the head pillow and the lumbar pillow. Of course if you're buying this style of chair then you would know that, but even then there is plenty of room to stick a small pillow in the space between the two of them if need be.Overall highly recommended",

Now I know my sore back was partially caused by my last chair who knew a chair could help you lower back? Lumbar pillows are very comfortable and adjustable. Only gave it 4 stars because of 0 seat tilt. Well worth the money and fantastic to relax in.",

While I was putting it together I did get a defected screw but thankfully it comes with 1 extra piece of every piece so I was able to replace it. I did struggle to put an armrest but after a while I was able to get it in well.I am a 5\u20195 130lbs female and it does not feel huge it feel like its perfect for my size. Haven\u2019t gotten to try the leg rest other than to just try it out hut it feels comfortable. Overall great chair and I have no regrets at all for buying the chair feels great.",
