Updated rating accordingly.Original review:Pros:- Easy to assemble- Wide and comfortable seat- Sturdy metal legs- Breathable backCons:- Chair slowly sinks lower during use. I have to raise it back up a couple times an hour.- chair doesnt support leaning back. As seen in pic, one side started to bend and crack and the bolt on the other side ripped out the bottom of the chair. I weigh approximately 225 lbs. The chair is rated for 300 lbs.I like the chair's features like the mesh back and wide seat. I'd pay more to get a similar chair that doesnt have these issues.",
