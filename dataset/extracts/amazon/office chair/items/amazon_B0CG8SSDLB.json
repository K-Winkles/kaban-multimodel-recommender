                "reviewText": "In looking for an office chair, I was looking for a mesh chair with a separate back support, headrest, and adjustable height armrests all at a low price (preferably near $100). This was one of the few chairs that met those criteria but I was also concerned that you get what you pay for. I decided to take a chance and was positively surprised. The chair came in a relatively compact box. Everything inside was well packaged/protected. All the screws were nicely labeled and pre-coated with loctite to prevent loosening. All predrilled screw holes were lined up perfectly. Assembly was straight forward. Once assembled, the chair seemed very solid and well built. Adjustability was good. Comfort was great. Overall, happily surprised based on price that this was an excellent purchase that should be considered if you are looking for a cost effective, well built, comfortable office chair.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Marsail Office Chair Ergonomic Desk Chair, and overall, it's been a great addition to my workspace. Here's what I've found:Pros:Comfortable Seat: The chair boasts a comfortable and well-padded seat that makes long hours at the desk much more bearable. It provides adequate support for my lower back, which is a must for someone like me who spends hours working on a computer.Everything Is Adjustable: What I love most about this chair is its adjustability. You can customize it to suit your preferences. The adjustable lumbar support is fantastic; it allows me to find the perfect level of support for my lower back. The chair's height is also easily adjustable, and you can recline it to different angles. This adaptability has really helped reduce any discomfort during extended work sessions.Metal Base: The metal base is sturdy and well-constructed. I feel secure and stable while sitting in this chair, even when leaning back. It's a nice touch that adds to the chair's overall durability.Cons:The Armrests: Unfortunately, the armrests are a bit of a letdown. They feel somewhat hard and uncomfortable when you rest your arms on them for an extended period. It would be great if they were better padded or could be adjusted more comfortably.Despite the armrests' minor downside, I must say that the Marsail Office Chair Ergonomic Desk Chair has improved my work-from-home experience. It offers excellent lumbar support, allows for a range of adjustments, and boasts a sturdy metal base. If you're looking for a comfortable and customizable office chair, this one is worth considering.Overall, I'm quite satisfied with my purchase, and it has made a noticeable difference in my comfort and productivity during long work hours.",

And the lean back has a good mid-tension to it, so you lean back effortlessly but are also well supported. At more a baseline price ( well sub 200 ) it seems a solid option that will be around 10+ years.",

This chair was easily my go-to since everything, and I can\u2019t stress this enough, everything is adjustable! From the arm rests to the head rest, you can technically \u201ccustomize\u201d this chair how\u2019d you like to fit your comfort level and that was a huge plus for me. It also reclines which is a bonus for added comfort. Assembly was easy to follow and it took me maybe an hour to fully put everything together. I say if you\u2019re thinking about getting this chair just do it. The only thing I would recommend is getting a cushion for the chair just for added comfort but other than that I have no complaints.",
