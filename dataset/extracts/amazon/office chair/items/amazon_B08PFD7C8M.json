Hardest part was deciphering the assigned letter-number combinations on the package of parts to those on the assembly instructions. Fabric is sound, the arms are at a comfortable height and position, and they do rotate up - parallel to the chair back and out of way for easy entrance and exit. The chair bottom is wider than others that I have bought with a solid mounting base (wood?). Rated comfort as 4 stars as the padding is not quite as thick as other chairs I've had. Will have to see as time passes if the padding stays firmly comfortable or not. Overall, pleased with this purchased.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this in June of last year, so I've been using this for about 14 months and never once felt comfortable in it. And just now, this chair almost got me killed! See below.(sidenote: It was actually pretty easy to assemble, but why assemble a piece of garbage that feels horrible and breaks in a really dangerous way? So, one star for that as well)Comfort/ergonomic issues:From the backrest to the front of the seat is over 20 inches so unless you're incredibly tall or most of your height is only in your thighs, you're going to feel tightness and soreness in your knees and thighs after using it. In addition, the lumbar support barely goes above the padding of the seat. That means the people designing this thing have zero understanding of how humans are shaped. How would a human with 20+ inch long thighs have their lumbar located at the very bottom of the seat!? I guess I'm saying this doesn't even make sense for tall people.ACTUALLY DANGEROUSLooking at it now this thing must have been made from repurposed, repainted scrap metal, that's all I can think. I'm not rough on my equipment, I'm an office guy, I don't slam down on my seat, I sit in it and I type. I'm 175 pounds, so any adult chair of even moderate quality should be fine under my weight. But just a moment ago, I was thinking to myself \"that's weird, the peg is in but it's letting me lean back...\" SNAP the seat rips backwards and I nearly smashed my head on a shelf behind me. See the picture. The metal holding the seat in place bends like taffy. Now that it's broken I was actualy able to bend some of the metal back \"into shape\" with my fingertips.I know it's been a year and it probably won't happen, but I want my money back. What an actual piece of garbage. Don't buy this. Don't let your friends buy this. I've bought office chairs around the same price that lasted me a decade, through rough \"college guy\" times and everything. This broke after a year of calmly sitting down in it in the morning.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Buy a better chair",
                "reviewText": "We bought a HON office chair on Amazon Prime Day. It was $145 on a good sale. We needed another chair and choose this one after looking at quite a few, for just under $75. We weren't trying to get something for nothing but we didn't want to spend even as much as we did for the HON on sale. Well, you really do get what you pay for.This chair is OK. It is not great, for sure. Time will tell if it's even good. I will raise my rating to 4 stars if it's still ok after awhile but there's nothing about it that would make it a 5 star chair.Comparing to the HON, this one is shipped in more parts meaning, more to assemble. The instructions are TERRIBLE. Really bad. I was grateful for the reviewer who marked them up with the right information and included that in their review. Sorry, I don't remember their name but if you are having trouble, go look for that review! That is what saved us. The problem is that the bolts and other parts are labeled one way on the packaging, another way in the parts list, and yet another way in the instructions. Hmmm.But, we got past that nuttiness and started putting the chair together. Really, 15 minutes should be tops time for this assembly but I'd already spent over 20 minutes just trying to sort out the hardware issue. The wheels go on easy enough, oh, and had to snap one of the legs on. Not sure why it was sent in two parts, perhaps for shipping reasons. Seems that would be a weak link though. The HON shipped without doing that, just a little bigger box. It also shipped with other parts already attached,There are some good scuffs on this chair. I assume they happened either in assembly or during packaging. Doesn't affect the mechanics of the chair but when you buy something new you like it to look new - at least I do.Where the holes are for the bolts there is quite a bit of spare plastic which should have been cleaned off during manufacturing. Mostly it won't hurt anything but it makes it look cheap. And, well, it is cheap. Cheap meaning not well made. One of the holes for attaching the arm to the seat bottom was stripped. We didn't strip it, it was stripped from the gitgo. Husband managed to fix it. I don't think we should need to repair a brand new item just to assemble it though.That said, it's together and we have sat on it. We'll need to monkey with the adjustments but just sitting on it I can tell it's not sturdy like the HON. The seat rocks a bit on the pedestal. Maybe there's some way to fix that, we'll try.Look, if all you have is $75 or whatever the price is at the time you're looking, it's an ok chair. It's better than no chair, and it's probably better than a lot of other chairs out there, but it's also not as good as many better chairs. Of course, those are more expensive. If you want a good chair that will last you a few or more years though, spend for it now and skip this one.I'll update my post after using the chair awhile.",

(I\u2019m 5\u20192\u201d) I like the fact that the arms flip up though. The back is supportive, again if you can reach it with longer legs. Not good for a short person to sit in all day.

Waaay better price + product than anything I was finding in the store. I needed help with maybe 1 or 2 steps (it seemed a 2 person job) besides that I put everything together alone in about 30mins!Sorry I don\u2019t have more pics of JUST the product but here is me sitting comfortably in it",
