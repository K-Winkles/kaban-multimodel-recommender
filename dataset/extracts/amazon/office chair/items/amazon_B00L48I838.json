                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely stunning for the price. A deep engineering perspective >> Surprisingly comfy & high quality.",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Shockingly high quality. Longevity a question mark, but treat it well and this is probably well worth the price.My impression is from the first 48 hours of owning the chair; I bought a pair of them for an office \u2014 but ... I do have a decade of engineering experience and I\u2019ll use that to give a highly detailed review!There are three or four main materials at play here: polycarbonate, steel, mesh fabric, and vinyl. Throw in some stitching, zinc and brass plated fasteners, and miscellaneous softer plastics and you have the whole picture.Starting from the base: The casters are fairly standard plastic with steel or zinc-coated base metal shanks. No surprises here. Replace with urethane if you want to not damage hardwood floors. The 5-pointed base itself is dense polycarbonate. Don\u2019t mistake this for metal! It\u2019s well engineered and has only a few minor flashing points made during mold separation. During assembly the hydraulic assembly is pushed unceremoniously into the base and it wedges in nicely. Disassembly is possible with some force but it won\u2019t slip on you.The seat of the chair bolts to the bottom attachment bracket with 4 m6 bolts. Black oxide here again no surprises. Some slight head oxidation means your chair is likely sitting in a warehouse for around 4-9 months before shipping to you. No big deal but worth noting.The actual seat is fabric with a vinyl edge. Compression is about 1/2 to 3/4 inch natural with a minor forward bias. This is great and keeps your posture on point, but you may feel you are \u201cslipping\u201d out of the chair if you try to sit in it improperly. Having the base of your back aligned with the chair back will do wonders for you.Stitching appears to be of reasonable quality on the vinyl edging and armrests. Those are soft vinyl too and will be your first failure point after a few years of use. Don\u2019t fret! These are easy to reupholster! Search on YouTube for guides.Overall the arms have some slight side wiggle to them that comes from their cheap push-button up/down operation. Normal. A little annoying if you like to adjust arm height a lot. Not a big deal overall. More molded plastic here; good quality like the base.The arms bolt to the seat and to the back of the chair... and THAT IS WHERE THIS THING SHINES.The back of this chair is large but not immodest and insanely comfortable. If you sit properly in this chair it feels better than some $1000 chairs. I am not kidding. I own some (admittedly used) $1000 chairs I also got for a steal. These are better. I am serious.The back of this chair feels luxurious and supportive with zero pressure points. It\u2019ll be comfortable up to around 6\u20196\u201d in height, and around 250-275lbs. Over that you should get a larger chair. (I\u2019m 6\u2019x170 for reference)To finish up: the mesh of the back is bolted securely to the frame which has admittedly decent looking slots for air to flow. It looks a bit spinal but it\u2019s all black so doesn\u2019t distract from overall aesthetics. Some included rubber end caps even cover the screws that secure the back to the seat. These will keep those black oxide screws from rusting underneath. (More m6 here by the way, with 12 used in total)As you can tell, I\u2019m honestly very very pleased and will be buying more of these. Possible future wish-list inclusions would be a mesh seat and bottom tilt adjustment. The slight forward bias may be annoying to some who don\u2019t like to sit far back in their chairs with good posture. But it\u2019s not a deal breaker at all.5 stars for overall quality and feel4 for aesthetics, mixed bag here5 for ease of assembly4 for materials. Black oxide fasteners do rust and vinyl can flake over time.3-4 for packing. Honestly everything was just jammed into the box but it seemed fine on delivery across both unitsAveraging this to a solid 4.5-5 for the final review.I almost don\u2019t want to leave this review because I feel like I\u2019m letting people in on a clever secret. But there you have it. Get one. Get two. Enjoy them. Value is all there. And I\u2019m big on sustainability. Spending more won\u2019t get you dramatically far from this even if you find more features in other chairs.Any questions or comments let me know.",

                "reviewText": "Quality of the product, unboxing and assembly play a part in this review.This chair is reasonably priced. I had a tough time deciding on whether or not I should buy this chair. After reading reviews stating that the product would arrive damaged, I can safely assume that this maybe from unboxing the chair incorrectly. The content should be slid on to a flat surface instead of being pulled out, as their odd shape and the box size make it to difficult without damaging the mesh and fake leather.Assembly was simply but difficult for a single person, though possible. Definitely do your best to follow the crudely labeled instructions.The reason for on a 4/5 review is due to the quality of the materials. The chair is made of a sturdy plastic, however the arms to wiggle an awful lot. Additionally, the fake leather on the arms seems too thin, as if it could rip at the seams simply from resting too much weight. I can definitely see it cracking and tearing over time.I do recommend this to anyone looking for a comfy budget chair, it is a very nice looking chair but do not expect it to last in the long run.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not sure where some of these people come from with their reviews: \"I WOULD NEVER SIT IN THIS CHAIR!!\" / \"THE WHEELS DONT WORK!\" / \"IT TILTS 5 DEGREES WTF!!\"Allow me to offer a sane, honest review of this chair. Long story short, its a good chair. For $130, its a great chair. My chair came in a normal box, required 10 screws (with Allen wrench included), and took about 20 minutes to fully assemble.The height is great for people who like to sit a little higher, but it can get low for those who need it. The back and lumbar support are adequate, and the armrests are a normal width apart, with comfortable padding. The seat cushion is thick, thicker than normal, and the tilt / tilt adjustment work fine. The casters (wheels) spin freely, dont jam on carpet, and we're easy to attach.So, to reiterate, its a good chair. It will be ALOT better if you're used to sitting in some $30-50 cheapie from Amazon, Walmart, Target, etc. If you want a dope chair, go spend $400+, and I'm not being a wise-a**. Good stuff, REALLY good stuff, costs good money. If you dont have that budget, this chair is fine. Better than fine.A couple notes: 1) If you're really short (5'2'' or below), the Seat of the chair maybe too long and you will not have adequate back/lumbar support. 2) If you're really tall (6'2'' and above) you may run into the opposite issues of the short people. 3) If you weight 300+ LBS, I dont recommend this chair as A) You are outside the manufacture's recommended weight limit and B) their isn't especially wide to accommodate a larger frame.",

This lives up to expectations and I'm really happy with it.As a smaller female (5ft3) it's a really comfy office chair with room to spare. The seat is a good size (I like to sit cross legged most of the time) and fits me perfectly.The design is stylish and it offers good back support, not too much or too little. I love that the arms move up and down. The wheels are a bit stiff and others have replaced them. I don't find it's a noticeable problem for me as I'm on carpet and it still moves.People also mentioned about the lack of backwards tilt in the chair itself but I don't tend to lean back so that's not a problem at all \ud83d\ude0aTook me about 15-20 mins to unpack and assemble.",
