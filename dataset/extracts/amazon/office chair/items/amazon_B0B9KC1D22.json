                "reviewText": "I'm happy with the chair. It's super comfy and the poly wheels are a nice touch that has it roll super smooth.Width is good for a husky fella like myself. Cushion is great. I enjoy the slight recline of the chair back in it's normal position, but I did see that some don't like this so much.I'm also just tall enough (or long legged enough) that my legs don't have an issue with the depth of the seat. I did see that some others found this to be problematic. Case in point is my female companion, her legs didn't touch the floor, but the seat is big enough that she can sit cross-legged as she enjoys.My only slight annoyance is that I think the chair could be slightly lower but that's personal preference. I'm the guy in the office that drops the chairs in the conference room to the lowest position. An inch or two drop in the hydraulic to lower the seat might also help with the point above with the deeper seat.It was also super easy to put together as long as you know to loosen the arm bolts as you're putting the back in place, otherwise you're going to suffer some difficulty like is mentioned in the other reviews.Overall, I'm really happy with the chair. Caveat: I've only had the chair and been using it for 2 months so I have no clue how it will hold up, but it's rock solid and good materials.",

                "reviewText": "This is a sturdy office chair, and I don't see this chair falling apart anytime soon. It has a good frame and the faux leather seems to hold up from scratches and tears well. My husband put this together but never complained about it being hard to do so, I am 5ft 7in and overweight for my height but not above 400lbs and I have no doubt this chair can hold me just fine. I have this chair on the lowest setting for height. If I had it adjusted any higher my feet wouldn't touch the ground especially due to the length of the seat of this chair. Once sitting I do have to kind of wiggle back into it to fully get my back to touch the back of the chair as it should. It does look very nice and is nicely padded especially compared to my old office chair. As for the Ergonomic Design for Back Pain this chair fails in that regard. It is adjustable as they say but it does nothing to support my back except feel like a big lump in the lower back area of the chair. The chair only leans back and rocks. This chair doesn't recline at all and the arms aren't adjustable. The sciatica I have has actually worsened in the short time I got this chair and my back has been hurting worse than usual (I ordered it Dec. 6, 2023). I would have to say this is a heavy-duty chair that could be comfortable if you lean back alot while working on the computer (possibly a gamer?). I don't lean back and like to sit up straight as I do lots of typing. I'm thinking I may return this chair but haven't attempted to do so yet. I dread having to take it apart and box it up for shipping as it's quite heavy.",
