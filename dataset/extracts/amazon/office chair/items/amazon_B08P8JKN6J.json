I could likely fix this with some oil, but I'm lazy.- Bad for sitting in cross legged. Not enough room because of the arm rest design going down to meet the chair cushion.- You will never ever get crumbs out of the mesh on the seat. Ever. Don't eat on this chair or prepare to live with the crumbs.TLDR if you're on a budget this is definitely worth it for what they're selling it at right now, which is around $20. I would not buy this chair again for it's list price of around $50.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this chair to replace an \"executive-style\" chair that cost more than twice the price the price. It looked very stylish, but no substance. Cheap materials that did not wear well.This one has more durable finishes, is very comfortable to sit in for work, has good back support, and tilts well, without feeling like I will tip over, when I want to put my feet up. The arm rests are a little low, but I find that does not matter. I can still use them well to help me stand up, when my legs are tired.The seat is firm and supportive, and height is easily adjustable. Strong wheels/castors, that glide easily across the floor.If you are looking for a good work chair, I don't believe that you will find a better one, and certainly not at such reasonable price. This chair is made in Viet Nam, which generally has higher production standards than elsewhere.There is one minor flaw. The chair comes with 2 M6-19 bolts for attaching the arm rests. These are too short. You will need 2 M6-25 bolts to do the job properly, which can be purchased at Home Depot (packet of 6) or elsewhere for around CAD 4.00. I tried to improvise with other bolts, but it did not assemble securely. If you have those bolts, assembly is quick and straight-forward (< 30 minutes).Enjoy the comfort.",
