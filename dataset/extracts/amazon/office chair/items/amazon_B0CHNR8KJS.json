I weigh about 180 -185 chair does securely handle my weight However after a little over a month of use I noticed some squeaking sounds coming from the chair. Nobody sits in it but myself & 5 year old son & I dont allow him to rock in it for safety reasons so Im not sure why the irritating sound started but ultimately the chair still feels strong & functions well. Cool Buy",

                "reviewText": "This \"office\" chair did not last for 1 week. I had to re tighten the screws and the chair is leaning to one side. The description stated that it is for lower back support and my back hurts everytime I sit in the chair to work. Very horrible chair if you work remotely and have to sit for hours. Ugh :(( . According to Amazon, my window to return it is closed and I really wish I could return the chair to get my money back. The worst :(.",

So you don't have tools don't worry. The only thing are the wheels. Those are not easy to just push in. I had to hammer mine. But 2 hard hits and it was in.",

The tools was labeled one way on the paper but another way on the tool package so I had to compare the sizes to figure out which was which. omg putting the arms on the chair was the hardest part, I would suggest looking for a youtube video or something.",
