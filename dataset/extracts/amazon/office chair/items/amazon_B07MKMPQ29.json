But the 3 holes are now slots and this is not entirely obvious at first. See attached pics. I show how the actual mechanism looks different from the manual, and how to align the slots.In addition, for the hanger, the manual says to remove 2 screws from the headrest. Those 2 screws are actually on the hanger, which also serves as the mount for the headrest. This also means you cannot mount the headrest without mounting the hanger. Based on other review I read here and elsewhere, this appears to be a recent change to address the difficulty in figuring out how to attach the hanger.Overall I am pleased but I feel like they could have taken the time to update the manual. I initially reached out to their support because I thought they shipped the wrong mechanism.Still, good chair. And a welcome upgrade from my old one.",

My neck and back would hurt pretty frequently from the long hours sitting in a poorly designed chair.I can definitely say, however, that after a month of using this chair, investing an ergonomic chair like this one makes all the difference! My neck and back muscles feel so much better supported with the adjustable rests on this chair; and the mesh, lightweight design makes it easy and comfortable to sit on this chair while I get work done for multi hour-long stretches as time. This is a must need for any student or any one that works from home.",

                "reviewText": "PROS: 1) Easy to assemble, sturdy, ergonomic support. Some reviews have noted the distance between the lumbar support and the mesh back as being too great, but the mesh itself has offered me great support, so I've not really had to fiddle with this. 2) I bought this because the seat and back are both mesh, hoping it would be cooler with more airflow -- and it is; wooden seats and cushioned seats I've used have made me noticeably hotter as the day went on. This chair doesn't have that issue. Exactly why I bought it.CON: 1) Not much of a negative, but because the seat is mesh and can't sit up higher than the edges of the frame the mesh is attached to, the seat frame can sometimes feel a bit more present pressing against the outsides of your thighs. (A cushion extends above the seat frame sides and doesn't exhibit this.) It's not bad, but occasionally I notice it. Not enough to drop my rating to a 4 star.UPDATE: Several months later, the seat wobbles side to side in the base. Feels unsteady. Will update again if it becomes a bigger problem.UPDATE 2: 2.5 years later, the ring in the base where the piston sits has cracked, causing the seat to wobble significantly more from side to side, like to the point where you wonder if you'll fall over in the middle of using it. This is because the housing where the piston rests is plastic. The stated seat weight capacity was not exceeded. I'm throwing out this chair and purchasing a different chair that is of more sturdy construction, and with actual lumbar support.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a chair with a mesh seat and back like the first generation Herman-Miller chair I tried at a job years ago. I really liked the mesh seat/back because I get hot easily. I went with this chair which was cheaper than another I found on Amazon. I liked the reviews better. I thought I got a more thorough idea of what I would get. So I went for the lower cost. In the reviews I read, people complained about the side of the seat digging into them because they were tall or they like to sit with one foot tucked under. I am 6' 5\" and I sit with good posture. If you like sitting in a funny position, this chair is not for you (it's also not good posture btw).Others complained about the headrest and armrests. I figured I would just take them off. However, the armrests are actually a perfect height for my desk. Others complained about the headrest being too low. It is fine. It could be higher but I don't rest my head on it when I am working, only if I lean back and take a break. It is high enough. The warning I would give you is that mesh seats can get uncomfortable after a while if you cross your legs or slouch especially in shorts. But I have a memory foam cushion that was supposed to keep me cool (it did not). I can always put that on the seat when I want.The chair was very easy to assemble. It has been sturdy enough for me and I am not light. I did get an extra warranty because I was a little scared by the negative reviews. The warranty was cheap and it gave me peace of mind. This chair beats the heck out of the very expensive and very well built solid wood desk chair I was using.",

Solo el tiempo dir\u00e1 como se comportan con el desgaste.-La malla es correcta, no es la mejor pero parece resistente.-El reposacabezas es un desastre, se mueve much\u00edsimo y el perchero no se puede quitar, si quieres reposacabezas vas a tener que montar el perchero s\u00ed os s\u00ed. Me parece una decisi\u00f3n terrible.-Las ruedas no son nada del otro mundo, ni las he montado, ten\u00eda unas de silicona tipo patines roller con freno y sin dudarlo son las que he montado.-Tema ergo: Bien, te obliga a poner la espalda de forma correcta aunque la sujeci\u00f3n lumbar no es nada del otro mundo.Por el precio no est\u00e1 mal, pero tiene muchas cosas a mejorar.",
