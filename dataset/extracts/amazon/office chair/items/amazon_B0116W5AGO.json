                "reviewText": "The chair is very comfortable. It was easy to put together. The \u201cair\u201d feature does not keep the chair cool and is completely not worth talking about. You will get warm if you sit in this chair for a long time - it\u2019s nothing as breathable as a mesh chair (obviously). The build quality is not very good. It does not feel like a sturdy chair. The arms wobble when you lean on them. I am sure it will eventually break. The only useful control is the height adjust. The chair can lean back, but it requires significant force and is not something you will choose to do.When it does break, I will buy something else. It is really comfortable for now, though.Update:Thanks to the coronavirus, I'm now using this chair full time. It's terrible. First, the right arm had already broken during incredibly infrequent use. Now that I have been using the chair full time for a couple weeks as I WFH, I hate it. The irony is that this is a chair fitted with \"AIR Technology\". Well let me tell you - air is the last thing my entire backside feels while sitting in this chair. The whole thing is like one hot recipe for swamp ass. I completely understand why my office chairs at work are mesh now - I have to take regular walks to dry out.Do not buy.",

                "reviewText": "I'm comparing this chair to all my previous chairs. I tend to buy a new office/game chair every year for $100 or so. An arm falls off, the fake leather peels from the fabric, the stitching comes undone and the chair will slowly lower while you're on the phone.My intent is to buy one chair that will last three years, at $100 per year. I'm 5'10\" and 215 lbs.My first thought was the chair was too damn comfy. I sat in my old chair and found that it had increased in hardness dramatically since I bought this new chair. I even went to the loft and sat in the game room chair. That chair is too damn hard. Back to the new chair and I slowly sink into the soft seating and comfort. I don't like my old chairs anymore.I've noticed my lower back is a bit sore. Not sore in general from sitting in my old hard chair but just sore in one location. This chair is improving my posture and my back isn't used to having good posture.You can lean back but you won't stay there without an effort. This chair wants you to sit up straight while working. You can't lean back and flip a switch to maintain that angle either. You can lock it so that you cannot lean back. You just can't leisurely recline. This chair wants to work you. This is not a gaming chair.Careful when installing. You need a firm grip when tightening the screws but herculean efforts will split the wood.",

                "reviewText": "Update: Customer service was great. I called, waited on hold about 15-20 minutes, and they offered to ship me a replacement seat (but apologized that it would likely take a while to arrive from the factory due to the upcoming Lunar New Year). I asked for replacement bolts which they shipped to me quickly from California. The replacement bolt seems to be working so far, and my chair arm hasn't fallen off since. I'm entirely satisfied by my customer service experience, but still wished for a bit higher quality on the chair itself. Original review now follows.It's a chair, and I can kind of safely sit in it, so I'll award it two stars. Problem is that one of the bolts for the arms is thinner than the nut it screws into, so the threads strip and the arm falls off. I'll update with my experience with customer service and/or return process.Good:- soft and seems comfortable- packed well, arrived undamaged- fairly easy to assemble, except the bolts for the arms are hard to get right (and one of my bolts is defective)- controls are fairly easy to reachBad:- assembly instructions are difficult to find (they were hidden inside the bag for the back piece, and looked more like an advertising tag than instructions)- chair back doesn't quire line up in the middle, so I feel like my body is being shoved to the right- one of the bolts for the arms doesn't fit the receiving threads properly, so just strips the threads and pulls out, basically ruining the chair- two of the 5 legs for the castors have splits in the wood: one is a three-inch-long split on the top and visible near where it attaches to the center, the other large split is through one of the screws underneath -- I worry if these splits get larger some of the wood will fall off (the actual structure is metal underneath the wood, so the structural integrity is not threatened)- the lowest height adjustment is pretty high, much higher than my old chair, so probably not good for short people. You probably need to be around average adult height to be able to comfortably rest bare feet on the ground.Pending:- customer service regarding the defective bolt (received over Christmas holidays so haven't been able to contact them yet)Bottom line: I cannot recommend this chair. The quality is not what I expected for this price point.",
