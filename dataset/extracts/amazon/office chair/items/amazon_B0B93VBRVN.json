                "reviewText": "Given other reviews, there must be some profoundly serious quality control issues with whoever manufactures this item. First, it's not s-curved (more straight up at the bottom and then arcs slight back after that) and even some of the images suggest it is not (yet other look otherwise - did they also have quality control issues with the renders?), but also it leans too forward when you sit in normal and leaving back doesn't really make that better (unless you pull the bar out and really push back).My dad, however, was fine with it, so I just let him use it and I have ordered a chair that DOES feature an s-curve and a nice bump at the lumbar area. This I can see on that other one in all product images the reviews too.So, it's not that the chair is bad if it comes to you without issue, but far too many people have what is basically a broken product. It might also be the case they are sending out two different chairs - but either way - MOVE ALONG AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!!!",
