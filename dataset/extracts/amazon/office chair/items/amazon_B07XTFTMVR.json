                "reviewText": "First, I was surprised that the arms has to be screwed into the seat back and seat cushion. It was awkward trying to get them to line up by myself. I worked on it for about 90 min then had to get to my desk and work. Worked up a bit of a sweat doing that. I decided I\u2019d finish putting in the screws a little at a time.One note is that I was short a couple of washers. Make sure you use them on the chair and not on the base.Finally got it put together and am so far pleased but it\u2019s only been a couple of days. It\u2019s a little larger than expected but the arms fit under my desk so I\u2019m happy with that. I wouldn\u2019t worry about back support because if you work at your computer you wouldn\u2019t normally be leaning back. Rolls nicely across the chair pad. It\u2019s a good looking chair. The gray is a little on the mocha side but I like it. I\u2019m at my desk all day so I will update my review to report on how it\u2019s holding up.I\u2019d give it a five if it wasn\u2019t so difficult to put together and the screw holes actually lined up.Update 9 mos later: This chair has held up remarkably well for 9 mos. It\u2019s still very comfortable to sit but I\u2019ve added a small memory foam chair pad to lift me up a bit. Perfect. I work at my desk all day, have 2 dogs that live in the office with me. No dog hair problems with this chair. Wheels are still gliding smoothly and fabric has held up. It is a deep chair so not ergonomic. I stil up straight but a back pillow may help. Otherwise a very satisfactory purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I've been working from home for well over a decade. So you can imagine I've tried various chairs. Some were awesome (and I was sad they were no longer made when the time came to replace them). Some were just ok. So when I tell you this one is by far worst I've ever had the misfortune to buy and sit in, you can trust me.The material feels insanely cheap (think 30 year old chair or couch in a really iffy motel). There is almost no padding in the arms. What padding there is in the seat and back compresses to almost nothing within 60 minutes of use. Yes it does \"rebound\" when you get out of the chair but then the process just starts over. Basically you end up stiff and sore from knee to lower back after a full work day. What might be worse is this: it does have \"tilt lock\". However even with it locked, if you lean back even a little bit,so your back is actually resting against the whole back of the chair, the seat tilts back about 20 degrees.If this was a forty dollar chair from one of the big box mega stores, I would understand and say you got what you paid for. But this thing cost me $150 and my cats don't even want to sit in it. (And at least one of them naps in the bathroom sink so it's not like they require extreme comfort!!)Long story short I gave it a full work week and then accepted it was only getting worse. (And yes I tried adding different cushions under me and behind me and got little improvement.) I've given up and ordered a different chair. As soon as it comes, this one is going.",
