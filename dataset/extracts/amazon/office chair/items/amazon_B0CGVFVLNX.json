The only issue I had was, the back piece that covers the plate and screws was EXTREMELY hard to put on and it still doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s on all the way. The top part of it will click in then you go to click the bottom part on and it pops off the top and it\u2019s just a back and forth fight trying to get it to stay on. Other than that little thing, no other issues. I got the blue and it\u2019s just as cute in person as it is online. It was a good price as well.",

In my opinion, the only downside is that no matter how you put the lumbar support pillow, it does not stay in place because there is no place to attach it. It is a price-performance product and is also very easy to install. Instead of wasting hundreds of dollars on buying a faux leather sofa and sweating while using it, I think it was a good idea to buy a sofa with a nice fabric like this.",

I reached out to the buyer via the \u201creturn or missing items\u201d tab, so if they can send the lumbar cushion I absolutely will give this 5/5 stars!!!It\u2019s heavy enough that I wont fall over, mesh fabrication is nice, wheels are smooth and neck support is awesome. Raising the seat is super easy and adjusting the back forward and backward is seamless.I really hope they can send me the part that was missing. I noticed on the outside of the box it said \u201cbecause of you this product has another chance\u201d so I\u2019m wondering if someone already had this?",
