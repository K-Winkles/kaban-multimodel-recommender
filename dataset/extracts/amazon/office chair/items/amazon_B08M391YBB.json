                "reviewText": "My old chair collapsed two weeks before I ordered this chair. Go figure, it was a spare dining set chair that I used because I was too cheap to buy an actual office chair. On a hot Saturday morning, right after breakfast, I decided to go into my office, log onto my computer and email some people I don't particularly like.So I go in, plop down onto the cushion of my trusty old wooden kitchen table chair. However, as soon as my bagels make with the chair, I hear a (POP) and down I go. I didn't get hurt, because I'm kinda tubby and have enough cushion of my own to break the fall. But, now, I needed a chair--a REAL chair... AN OFFICE CHAIR!(Damn... Now I gotta spend money)So, there I was, looking around for the most economically-reasonable (okay, cheapest) chair to buy. I searched around several sites when I came across this one on Amazon. It took me two hours to decide to pry open my wallet and buy it. I'm livid because my wife wouldn't let me use another dining chair, I can't play Solitaire on either of my dual monitors, and I can't email my friends and tell them that they are no longer welcome at ANY of my cookouts because THEY eat more than ME. But moreover, I was PO'ed because I have to wait for my chair...But not too long...The chair actually came about four days later. I was coming home from work when I saw the box on my porch (*OH, JOY*). I jumped out my truck, scooped it up before any bad-assed neighborhood kids could steal it, took it straight back to my office and unpackaged it. I was actually kinda disappointed: the chair was a mass of plastic and cloth. It looked weak; I gave it about a week before I'd be on the floor again.It was easy to assemble, and once it was up, I figured--hell, it looks kinda nice. However, the true test would come with actual use (here come the buns).For the money I paid for it, this is a nice chair. It's comfortable and very sturdy. It rolls and swivels easily. Unlike my old kitchen chair, this one doesn't cut the circulation in my legs; I can sit at my computer and work, email anbd play games for hours without any pain,numbness or lower leg swelling.While this is a nice comfy chair, I gave it four stars for ergonomics because it's not very comfortable to sleep in. But other than that, I'm glad I bought it",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This Home Office Chair with Mid Back PC Swivel Lumbar Support, adjustable height, and adjustable tension for the seat to lean back, offers Ergonomic Comfortable Mesh and Armrest. It is a fantastic addition to my home office. At first, I thought it would be difficult to assemble, but after opening the box and reading the directions, it was very simple. It took me about 10 minutes to put together; it's really straightforward. This chair offers remarkable comfort and functionality. Its ergonomic design provides excellent lumbar support, while the adjustable features allow for personalized comfort. The mesh material keeps me cool, and the swivel function allows for easy movement around my workspace. The chair feels sturdy and well-designed, and the sleek black color adds a professional touch. Overall, it's a top-notch chair that enhances both comfort and productivity in my home office. For the price, you seriously can't go wrong. It has a nice design, is easy to assemble, economical, and looks pretty cool. But most importantly, it's super comfortable. My only complaint is the smell; it has a weird odor to it which I hope goes away. I'm not really sure why it smells or what the smell is, but I'm leaving it outside for a day, hoping it goes away.",

Unfortunately after a year of use (I am on my computer a lot), the chair would randomly change height positions, as if I would sink slowly and have to pull the lever and the chair height up again. Last night my chair would not lock in position and nearly hurt myself. I wondered why and took a look this morning and to my investigation, I found out why. This area is not very well made. I am not a heavy set person nor do I tilt back much. Great comfortability but not too sturdy or long lasting.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new chair for my computer desk at home because the chair I had (not an office chair, more of a small lounging chair) was killing my back. I didn't see the weight limit on this chair before I bought it. That's unfortunate because I weigh more than the stated limit, but I've had the chair for a couple of weeks now. It doesn't look like it's going to break. For the most part the chair is quite comfortable, and my back has stopped hurting. The chair is easy to put together and easy to adjust. It offers a decent amount of support. My only real complaint is that when sitting in a straight, upright position, the chair kind of leans forward and downward rather than flat. That's annoying at times but not too bad. Something I like about this chair is that the fabric doesn't seem to collect much dog hair.This chair is not durable enough for a professional setting, but I highly recommend it for those who want a supportive chair for a home office that doesn't take a lot of space. If you weigh significantly over 200 pounds this chair won't work quite as well for you, but it should still work ok if you can't find something better in your price range.",
