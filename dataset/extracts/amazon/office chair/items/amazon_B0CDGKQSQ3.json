I have it on carpet and I'm still able to wheel in and out of my desk smooth enough. I only have to sit in it for about 4 hours at a time and I'm comfortable enough, sometime i use a pillow for a little extra back support. The tilt function works fine, I'm not one for leaning back in a chair but it's there if i need it. It's a nice looking chair. The quality of the material looks good and feels good. The construction of the chair is well made, it doesn't feel wobbly. It was simple to put together, i did it by myself.",

                "reviewText": "The only reason this chair is priced so fairly is because upon opening the box, it looks intimidating to assemble. But it wasn\u2019t so bad and I did it alone until the last big step(maybe 30mins total while whipping up dinner). You need a second set of hands to assemble the back. But it didn\u2019t take long and it was worth every second! Not a lot shocks me but how much I love this chair did! Our chair was purchased in brown and it\u2019s classy, sturdy, glides, swivels, doesn\u2019t rock much, great support and head rest,it\u2019s extra wide (I can sit cris cross), my feet don\u2019t fully touch the floor when I (5\u20191) sit all the way back but I am completely okay with that. I highly recommend the chair it\u2019s worth every penny, and in my opinion way more.",

                "reviewText": "I work from home full time, and then attend law school online at night, so I'm in a desk chair A LOT. I needed a new desk chair with more support, but didn't want to break the bank. This was a great purchase. It's a beautiful chair to look at - I love the cream color. It's overall very comfortable, and a perfect height for my desk. It's easily adjustable. It was very easy to put together as well. My only complaint is that the tension is quite a bit tighter than other chairs when you lean back in it, but that's not a deal breaker for me, as I don't lean back a ton in the chair anyway.",

The are rests can be positioned at a 45\u00b0 or can be raised up as shown in picture. I would recommend this chair. It's a great office chair and very fair price.

It took about 20 minutes to unpack the box and the pieces. I put it together in less than 45 minutes. These old eyes needed a magnifying glass to read to fine print directions.

Plus a weird smell.Then I started trying to put the darn thing together and I quickly realized that this was going to be a huge challenge, especially for one person.Because of the nature of the cheap and poorly aligned screw holes you have to squeeze and push the chair to get things to fit right, which just can't be done with one person. While struggling to put in one of the screws, the wrench slipped and the screw basically glided through the cheap leather and made an ugly gash.I still haven't been able to put it together after multiple trys and re reading the instructions (just in case for any reason it was user error???) and taking it apart again and again.If I could give one word of advice, single people do not buy this, and if you have an extra 50$ just spend it on a higher quality chair.
