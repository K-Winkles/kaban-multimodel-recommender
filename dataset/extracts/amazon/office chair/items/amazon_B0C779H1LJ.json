The adjustment knob under the seat works great for regulating the degree of tension while reclining. I have no illusions about the longevity of the bonded leather. I hope to get two to three years before the inevitable pealing begins, and a few more before it's an eyesore. Until then I think it will be a comfortable chair. The padding is generous, the lumbar is firm and the quality is better than expected at this price point. Assembly was simple. Not sure why some reviewers have had difficulty. A half hour job at the most.",

I took a chance and ordered this chair and it came today. The instructions for putting it together were super easy, and it didn\u2019t take me too long to get it all set up. It\u2019s super comfy, and the fabric is the perfect shade of pink. The upholstery is soft and I definitely wanted something fabric\u2026I\u2019m in Florida and my old leather chair would make me sweat like crazy. That chair is also a Serta so I knew it would be good quality. Definitely recommend if your looking for something comfy, sturdy and cute!",

Only took about 15/20 minutes to assemble.It has a decent amount of padding for the back and butt. The arms could have a bit more padding but they aren't uncomfortable.The height adjustment works well. The reclining is a bit stiff and difficult to do, but it might be because it's new. The wheels roll around with no problems.The fabric stitching is good. The fabric isn't as soft feeling as I thought it would be. It's a tiny bit on the scratchy side. It does seem to be decent quality though. It's not solid black but closer to a charcoal gray color.",

If I figure it out I will tell you later it's 30 it is comfortable except for my lumbar area. I'm not impressed like I thought that would be but it's OK. The color pink is beautiful.",

I honestly have not been this disappointed in a purchase from amazon ever. $171 dollars out the window. I cannot come up with the words to describe how pathetic and junky this product is. It is very obvious the manufacturer had every intention of ripping of the customer. Why so disappointed? I purchased this product on June 15, 2020 to replace an old chair because I started working from home due to COVID. Within weeks the seat pad is down to nothing and I had to buy a Amazon memory foam pad to help out my rear. It would hurt after sitting for more then a couple hours, worse then sitting on a metal chair. Next the material on the arms is too rough and textured, I find my self with irritated elbows by the end of the day. Then it began making all kinds of noises here recently, squeaking and creaking noises. And now finally the chair height is lowering and now longer holds its position. I weigh 195 pounds NOT 500. Today, November 11, 2020 I am chairing shopping again. Total garbage product. PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!!",
