                "reviewText": "Packaging: The chair is well packaged. All the parts were in the box. All of the hardware is labeled including a small pack containing extra pieces of hardware just inn case they are needed. The allen wrench has a T handle and is a step up from what I typically see. The seat and back come covered in plastic.Assembly: Overall the assembly is easy. The steps are in logical order starting with attaching the spider legs (my term) being attached to the center piece. At step 4 of the assembly the instructions show putting a cosmetic cover piece that hides the bolts that attach the legs to the center piece. This cover was not in the box. I reached out to the seller & they promptly responded. The assembly instructions in the box was a first addition. There is a second addition that illuminates that step because the cover is no longer needed. They sent me an electronic version of the correct assembly instructions. I did notice during assembly that there didn\u2019t seem to be a need for the cover because they design looks finished without the cover.Appearance: When assembled the chair looks nice. The feel of the material is nice. The finish of the back and seat were good. There were no issues with poor seams or sloppy sewing lines. It looks like they have a good level of quality control in place.Comfort: The chair feels nice with good lumbar support. I feel like it fits like a glove. However, I\u2019m only 5\u20196\u201d tall. I wouldn\u2019t expect a taller person to have that kind of fit. The lumbar support is not adjustable. The chair will adjust in height and the recline function can be locked out.Overall I would recommend this chair as a good, no frills chair that\u2019s comfortable. Time will tell if there are durability issues.",

                "reviewText": "I got this chair as an upgrade for the one I had been using. The one I had I pulled out of someone's garbage on the side of the road 10 years ago, and it was still fully useful I just wanted something nicer. So far this chair is beautiful and comfortable. It took me less than 30 minutes to put together, but I do construct furniture rather frequently so I'm not sure if that was fast or average. The directions were clear enough and the tools were included, which is always awesome. I'm not a small person and I feel comfortable sitting in this chair. It is sturdy and feels well made. It moves up and down easily. The arms move up and back out of the way which is nice to push it completely under my desk. Obviously I can't say if it's going to last a long time quite yet, but for now it looks really nice and is comfortable and affordable. I love it so far!",

The legs at the base are metal as opposed to plastic, which is a overall plus from a quality standpoint. I'm 250 and the pneumatic (?) height control appears to stay in position without sinking, so far. Overall I recommend this chair, especially in terms of overall value.",

                "reviewText": "This is an exceptional price for this quality chair. It only took 30 minutes to put together. The directions are very explicit and easy to follow. There is only one tool needed to put the chair together, and they even supply it along with the bolts needed. I'm a woman in my sixties and I found it very easy to put together by myself. It looks beautiful and luxurious. I love that the seat raises to a full 23 inches. My last chair only went up 20 inches and it was not high enough for my desk. This is perfect! Of course, the chair can rock back and forth as well. Another great feature is that when you are done working you can raise the armrests so that the chair can slide all the way into the desk saving lots of room. My other chair was giving me lower back pain. No pain at all in this chair. Well worth the investment. The only issue I had was that the right armrest had black scratches and staining on the silver structure area. The rest of the chair was perfect. So I emailed the company at their customer service email address. They responded very quickly and within just a few days sent me a brand new right arm piece unit at no charge that was in perfect condition. Excellent customer service. Very pleased. 5 stars.",

I assembled it, and then immediately contacted the company that made it before returning it.This company is amazing. I sent them all the pictures of the problems, and quite honestly, we were amazed at their outstanding customer service. They were very professional, and they immediately fixed all the problems.We don\u2019t , or rarely, have companies that have this kind of customer anymore. Neo Chair was simply outstanding.The chair is very well made, super easy to assemble, and it is the highest quality.When my wife sits in it all day, every day for work, she smiles t me, telling g me how comfortable this chair is, and thanks me for getting this for her.That should tell you everything you need to know.I highly recommend you buy this chair.By the way, we bought the White one, and it is gorgeous.",
