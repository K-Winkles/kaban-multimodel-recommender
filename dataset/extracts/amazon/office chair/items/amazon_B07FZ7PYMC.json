However, you will want to order new wheels. Do not bother with the ones that came with this chair (not pictured, black cheap plastic). As you can see in my pictures I have hard floors so one would think this chair would move with ease. IT DOES NOT. Gets stuck constantly when you try to move, are noisy and it will annoy you to no end. Not sure why they used such cheap wheels for a chair at this price point. The wheels are on Amazon for $20. Go ahead and buy them now so they arrive with the chair. After this quick fix I love the chair. I got white wheels to match and they glide and make zero noise (unlike the ones that come with the chair). You will not be disappointed once you tweak the chair!",

                "reviewText": "The chair arrived with a tear in the armrest, but the costumer service was excellent and the chair is great. The chair arrived in a large box and everything was packaged either with bubble wrap or in its own box. I received all of the pieces and instructions. They give you all of the tools you need to put the chair together and it only took me about 8 minutes or so to put together. Upon arrival, one of the arms of the chair had tear in the fabric. I assembled it anyways, and decided I would try to my fate with customer services. On the outside of the box that the chair arrived in, there was a customer service line. It said to call this number instead of returning. I called the number was greeted quickly. The woman on the phone was quick. She asked me if I still had the box, and ask for me to read her a number off the shipping label. I did that and it pulled up my shipping address and contact information and she knew who I was and my information without me having to tell them over the phone. Then she asked if I still had the instructors to assemble the chair, I told her yes, and she asked me to find the part I needed replace and look for the part number next to it. I gave her the information, and she said it would ship the next day and asked if I would like an e-mail with the tracking information. I said yes. I actually received an e-mail with the tracking information and I received the replacement part. Not only that, I received two arms. The entire process was painless and quick. Possibly the best, fastest and easiest costumer service I've ever experienced. The chair is a bright white. It tilts back, raises and lowers easily. Spins. The assembly was simple. The product exceeds my expectations and so did the costumer service.",

                "reviewText": "Overall, this chair was mostly fine with one serious problem: the back isn't well supported. It looks like a solid back but it's just a metal frame with fabric and elastic in the interior of the back. When I lean back into the chair, the back just gives way (see second picture). My last chair had a continuous board in the very back so that the back padding compressed against something sturdy. This chair just seems to have an elastic band buried in there. Even worse, I can feel it when I lean back. Another minor gripe is that the chair felt a bit small but that could just be that I'm used to somewhat oversized chairs and I like to sit cross-legged in the chair sometime.Other than that, the chair was fine. It arrived on time and undamaged. The packaging was reasonable and assembly was quick. There were some minor imperfections (first and third pictures) but nothing serious. Disassembly was a bit of a PITA but that's not really the manufacturer's fault.It looks pretty nice. Too bad it doesn't feel that nice.",
