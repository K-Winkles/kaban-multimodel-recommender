                "reviewText": "This is the third chair I've purchased from this manufacturer. It is obvious that they listen to feedback from customers and make every effort to improve form and function. Apart from the cheerful colors, the big upgrades on this chair are the fully adjustable headrest, the thicker cushion, and the wider back. The coat rack will also be a useful feature for many people at the office. I am a piano teacher who sits for long periods of time, working with students. When I'm not teaching, I sit in my craft room for long periods. I have pinched nerves in my neck and lower back. I cannot overstate the importance of my chairs being as ergonomic as possible. This chair is ideal for me at 5'5\", with the seat in the lowest position. The S curve fits my back perfectly, and the mesh is extremely comfortable. If needed, I can tweak the position of the padded/cushioned lumbar support with the built-in adjustment slider. The adjustable headrest makes such a difference to me. I can easily shift it if I need to relieve pressure on my neck. This is the chair you won't mind sitting in ALL day. I LOVE the color combinations, which are perfect for my little craft room. I can easily roll the chair from one workstation to another. The chair feels sturdy, and the quality is all top-notch. I believe it will last a long time. It was easy to put together. They included the necessary tools and even provided white gloves for handling the hydraulic lift. This is a fantastic chair for the price. The quality and value make it stand out from the rest. You can't go wrong with this one.",

I also really like the vented back.The lumbar support really impressed me, as it is adjustable and stays in place. I also love the coat hanger attachment for the headrest.Construction was simple and only took about 30 minutes. I really liked the attention to detail, as the product also included screw covers to keep a nice, clean look. Instructions also came with gloves, which was very thoughtful!",

                "reviewText": "The assembly took about 45 minutes - not too difficult. Instructions were OK, but no clear explanation of how to adjust the built in lumbar support although the existence of the lumbar support is mentioned on a picture. Chair seems sturdy and is very comfortable. There is some concern how the light colors will hold up in the long run. The spokes on the base are painted white, and sometimes I rest my feet there - already showing scuff marks - a rubber strip on top of the spokes would help.In sum it seems to be a sturdy and very comfortable chair at a reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "I got this chair for my wife as a gift. She's pretty picky about these kind of stuff, but this one really met our expectations. First off, it looks sleek and modern \u2013 the wide backrest and cool design give it a professional vibe. Plus, they added a coat hanger at the back, which she found really handy. The chair is not just about looks, though. The flip-up armrests are a cool move \u2013 you can easily slide it under the desk, saving space. The foam cushion is comfy without being too soft or too firm, perfect for long hours of sitting. My wife loved especially the adjustable lumbar support feature after the old one - it's great for back pain due to long work hours. Putting it together was pretty easy, took me around 20-25 minutes. And the 5-year warranty is a nice bonus for that extra peace of mind. In a nutshell, it's a mix of style, practicality, and comfort. My wife loved her new chair, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a top-notch ergonomic chair without sacrificing style.",
