It fits right in with my black and wood desk and my black walls. Plus, it looks super cool.The chair is really sleek and has this modern vibe that I love. The black color is just right \u2013 not too dull, not too shiny. It looks professional but also kinda edgy, which is exactly my style.It's not just about looks, though. This chair is comfy! I can sit in it for hours and not get that weird backache. And you can adjust it to fit just right, which is a huge plus. Oh yea since it has a curved end and not a 90 degree angle in the middle of the chair I can slouch a little without feeling lazy or making my back hurt which I love after sitting at my desk fkr a couple hours or just watching Netflix.",

Since I also conduct virtual sessions I sit at me desk sometimes for a few hours so the chair needed to also be comfortable. This chair fits the bill.

The padding is great and I can sit in it for hours without discomfort. The swivel and heigh adjustment works as expected. The faux leather is super easy to clean and I imagine it'll last a very long time and look beautiful for many years.",

I was worried whether I would be able to put it together and I\u2019m shall we say mature ahem, but I was! The directions were plenty clear and it was easy enough to put together. I am using it as an office chair and I enjoy the way it looks. My only problem is I am short and my feet don\u2019t get all the way to the floor even on the lowest setting. But I am kind of used to that when do they? \ud83d\ude06\u263a\ufe0f I would as people have said before me buy this chair. You might just like it!",

                "reviewText": "I was given these chairs to review. My original Amazon Vine order was lost in transit, but the seller kindly replaced them. I already have some bar stools from this brand, so I was anticipating that the seats would be well-padded and comfortable. I was not disappointed.These are very, very easy to assemble. Each chair requires just 5 bolts (though you get extras) to connect the legs and attach them to the seats, and the Allen key to tighten them is included. In fact, the fixings for each chair are separately packaged in blister packs with the bolts sorted by size, so everything is really clearly laid out for you.The chair legs don\u2019t join as I\u2019d expected - each set comes as two arches, which connect together to form an X-shaped frame, which is then attached to the underside of the chair. I assume that this crossed frame design gives better strength than parallel legs. The pictorial instructions are clearly laid out and straightforward to follow - though I did invert the crossed table legs to join them together, finding this easier than attaching the bolt from the bottom up as depicted. Everything came well-packaged, with the seats wrapped in plastic bags, and the metal legs wrapped in protective foam.The faux leather seats are quite smart-looking, and the diamond pattern is well-padded. If I\u2019d been buying these, rather than receiving them as a review item, as a matter of personal preference (and because the flooring in my craft room, where I\u2019m using these is white) I would probably have opted for the white version rather than the grey, but I don\u2019t mind this colour though it does seem a bit darker in real life than in the main product images. There was a bit of a chemically smell from the seats when I first got them out of the packaging, but this didn\u2019t linger. The metal legs are black with a matte finish.Height-wise, these work well for me (I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d), but when my Mum (who is 5\u20192\u201d) sits back on them her feet don\u2019t touch the floor",

The hollow metal legs do make a slight rattling sound when moved, but it's not a big deal to me.What really stands out about these chairs is how comfortable they are. The grey upholstery is extremely soft and well-padded, making it a pleasure to sit in these chairs for extended periods of time. They add a touch of sophistication to my dining room, while still being practical and comfortable for everyday use.Overall, I'm very happy with my order and would highly recommend these chairs to anyone looking for a stylish and comfortable seating option for their home.",
