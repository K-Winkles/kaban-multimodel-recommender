Small size is great for my 5'2\" frame. I wish I could have had this at the beginning of the school year. The price went down and it made it an easy buy.",

                "reviewText": "I have a small home office set up and space is limited. This chair is perfect for me. I\u2019m petite so it\u2019s the right size. It was easy to assemble and is very comfortable to sit in for long stretches of time. I like that it comes in a variety of colors. My husband and son sat in it (both over 5\u20199\u201d) and it was comfortable for them too. I might actually order another one for my son\u2019s desk because he doesn\u2019t like his big, bulky office chair. I think the price is pretty decent too, but it does tend to go up sometimes, so grab the chair when it\u2019s at a good price. Also, some colors it comes in cost less than other colors, so if you don\u2019t care about the color, you can get the cheaper one. Overall, it\u2019s a good chair and I\u2019d recommend it.",
