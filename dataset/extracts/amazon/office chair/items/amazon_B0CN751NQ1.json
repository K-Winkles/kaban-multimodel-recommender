I work nine hours a day and I\u2019m usually in my chair I like that it has like a vibrating massager and it also gets warm. It doesn\u2019t get too hot or uncomfortable actually gives like a perfect warmth, I also like that it reclines and it can lean back and you can lock it also has a leg rest underneath it\u2019s very simple and it pulls out and flips over and it\u2019s for your legs it\u2019s really comfortable, I have zero complaints I put it together myself. It took me about 10 minutes on with unboxing. It takes about 25. I was really impressed with the chair and how well it made it is.",
