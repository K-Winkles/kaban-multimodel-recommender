The seat is extra wide so that you can sit cross-legged if you wish and has a lot of support. There are 8 screws to put this together and it took only about 10 minutes. If I need another computer chair I am definately purchasing another one of these chairs. Worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a wide armless chair because I like to sit cross legged at my desk and wanted something big enough for me and my little dog. Note: this chair is wide but when used at a desk it\u2019s space efficient because you can push it in pretty far. I work from home so I wanted something that would be comfortable to sit in every day, 8+ hours a day. So far this meets the mark. It was also very easy to assemble thanks to well written, clear, English instructions (there were 8 screws in total I think, but nothing complicated). Definitely consult the instructions even though it\u2019s pretty simple, there was a helpful diagram of how to push on the chair back and seat to get the holes to align for the screws. The fabric seems tightly woven and of good quality, with finished edges and no loose strings. Very happy with my purchase and glad I listened to the other positive reviews on here.",

These past couple months I\u2019ve been staying at home and trying out new things that can elevate my house as well as be useful. That\u2019s when I came across this beautiful chair. I had a normal office chair before getting this one and the difference is huge. Beyond its captivating appearance, the comfort level of this chair is unparalleled!!! The plush cushioning provides the perfect balance between support and softness, making it my go-to spot after a long day. The ergonomic design cradles my body, and I find myself sinking into relaxation every time I sit down. My husband assembled the chair for me and said that it was very easy and straightforward. Although I have a dining area I find myself going to the living room just to sit on this chair and binge watch shows while I snack (and the snacks fit on the chair too). I honestly never thought that I would spend most of my time on a chair but I am not complaining!",
