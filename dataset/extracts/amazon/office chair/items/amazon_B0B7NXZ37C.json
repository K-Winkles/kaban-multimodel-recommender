I know your pain in seeking a chair because there are so many chairs, so many options, so many reviews! I chose this one for the reviews and I could not be happier with this choice. It took minutes to assemble, has all the hardware and a tool to use, easy assembly too. It has a midback back to it, which was really nice, the seat is very comfortable and the material on the outside is nice. I am kind of picky about material because some of it is icky to the touch for me but this is really nice. All in all, especially for the price, this chair is well worth it. Rolls smoothly, raises and lowers smoothly, and keeps me comfortable during those long hours.",
