My only complaint is that the back is not adjustable, and when you lean back into the chair, you're leaning back too far. Small issue, maybe holding my body upright off the back will strengthen my core, lol. Overall a good chair.",

                "reviewText": "Got this as an auxiliary desk chair. Specifically didn\u2019t want bulky arm rests so this one did the trick.It adjusts up and down and swivels. However it does NOT recline. Seat padding is meh on this. The mesh back has a slight give so that\u2019s ok.Lower back starts hurting after an hour or two sitting in it. May need to invest in a c-spine cushion to make it more tolerable.This chair is more of a basic task desk chair that\u2019s not meant for comfort. I just like it bc it\u2019s a smaller footprint than the traditional desk chairs.",

                "reviewText": "Description here and on Wayfair says 250 lbs however, manufacturer indicates 275 for those who are interested.This is very classy looking chair.Supper easy to assemble in under 20 minutes.Includes Allen Key so absolutely no other tools needed.Leather look alike is quality and well stitched.Seat padding is thicker than expected. Should last well. It\u2019s not cushiony so it has less chance of breaking down.All 5 claws are solid steel and welded together \u201cno nuts or bolts\u201d it\u2019s very solid. Apart from the castors, the only plastic part is the chrome cover that drops down over the centre claw piece.No metal exposed parts where seating so I\u2019m confused why another raised that being an issue.It glides effortlessly across our laminate floor and seat swings around, lifts up and down quietly and with ease.$229 is a fair price all considering.Not sure I\u2019d use it for an office/home office use where you\u2019d be sitting for hours at a time but, it\u2019s certainly suitable for a few of hours. My main use will be for sewing or at my home desk during shorter periods while using MacBook.Very pleased with this purchase with only one exception, hence the 4 stars, it is not \u201cmade and assembled in North America\u201d.If anything should change, I will be right back to update.Update June 2023 - chair is still as it was new without an issues whatsoever.",

The back conforms well to the back, but leaning on it you will be supported by the bent tube steel. There is no option for allowing it to angle at all - the only control is height adjustment. In terms of chair for the dollar, it's not bad. The base is sturdy and the wheels roll well. However, I don't get the feeling it'll last particularly long, and more importantly I'm already thinking I need to replace it (I've had it for about 2 weeks now). So I will say that it's an ok chair, but I regret buying it.",

The back has no padding so you get the metal frame digging into your back, and the bottom doesn't have much cushion. After a while of sitting on this you might as well be sitting on a wooden chair. However if you make the same mistake i did you can kinda fix the frame issue with a hoodie/sweater slipped over the top with one arm inside the other. and the bottom can be fixed with a pillow, looks ridiculous though.",
