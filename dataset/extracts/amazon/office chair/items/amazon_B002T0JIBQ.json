        "description": "Articulating the sophistication of European styling, along with the functionality of a multi-positional chair, this chair is sure to please. Mid-back office chairs are the logical choice for performing an array of tasks, offering support to the mid-to-upper back region. This chair is ideal for anyone who does a great deal of typing throughout the day and needs good back support. The locking back angle adjustment lever changes the angle of your torso to reduce disc pressure. The contoured seat dissipates pressure points for greater comfort. The waterfall front seat edge removes pressure from the lower legs and improves circulation. Chair easily swivels 360 degrees to get the maximum use of your workspace without strain. The pneumatic adjustment lever will allow you to easily adjust the seat to your desired height.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this chair realizing the picture was a black chair but the description stated it was Burgundy. I figured like most things this model was available in different colors so I looked through all the pictures. Several showcase this with and without armrests. Knowing some chairs you have the option of installing the arms or not, this was a HUGE selling point for me as I wanted 2 identical chairs, yet I didnt want arms and my husband did. Now after its been processed I get an email saything these chairs are ARMLESS! Now minutes after I get notice that this has been processed the company says I will have to pay for shipping and handling for these to go back to them once it arrives here!!! The company said the arm rests are sold seperately, I asked how much that would be and have not received any more replies from them. In all my years of buying through Amazon I have never had anything like this happen. Very unhappy. =(",

                "reviewText": "My new chair arrived last night, so it's only got about 10 minutes of sit time, but those 10 minutes are a huge upgrade from time spent in my previous chair. There was a small snag in the fabric in the front, but a quick snip with some scissors and you can't tell. Also, the back support is covered in a rubber piece which was pushed in in several places, but that's merely an aesthetic issue. The seat is quite firm and feels like it should hold up well. Set up was quick and easy. though the directions consisted of a picture-their version didn't have arms, so the bolts provided didn't match the photo, a little confusing if you're the type to do a quick inventory of parts before starting, but it didn't effect construction after that. Has an easy movement for up/down and tilt to the seat back, the arm settings are more fixed. There is also a knob on the side for lumbar support. All in all I feel it was a great purchase for the $90 that Amazon was asking at my time of purchase, however if I wouldn't have saved the $200 like they claimed I might have been a little put off by the snag and back support.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this item because of the good price and reviews I had read. Since i plan to use it for quilting and sewing I didn't need arms. Once I sat on it I knew it was the perfect choice. There seems to be good support for my back and sitting for short periods. It was easy to put together which was a surprise. I am not an engineer so did what I could then hubby helped with the rest.When it arrived one side of the box was ripped and you could see what was inside. I ordered this used and guess that means that the warehouse was instructed not to tape the box together where it was torn. Other side was perfect howver top was crushed. It was so bad the delivery person made a not and I took pictures of the mess. As it turned out everything was intact and that was a surprise. Everything turned out fine but it was a scary delivery. One more thing instructions are in picture form rather than written for anyone that might find that info helpful.",
