                "reviewText": "NOTE: I recently purchased this chair again because I broke my other chair (yes it was me, not a defect) and I need to warn everybody that this chair has changed a little. The arm rests are thinner and harder and the seat and back seem more cushioned. The arm's aren't a big deal and still do the job well. I think I actually like the less padding more, since the old arms began peeling from being compressed and the material pinched. The cushion difference may be due to it being new and springy vs old and worn.I have always had issues with chairs always cutting into my MASSIVE thighs. When I got up, I would have large divots in my legs from where the chair cut into me. Some chairs, like the 500lbs rated Hercules chairs were the worst offenders. How the heck could somebody design a chair for a fat person and not design it FOR A FAT PERSON? This chair was fairsy easy to build, no worse than any other (use your brain and it's ez)This chair gives me a good 1-2 inches of space for my legs and its AMAZING.Previously, I was using the Cressfield/Osgood style chair. These chair are amazing, but I had sat in mine so long it was creaking and looking like it was about to break. So I look for big chairs for big bois. All of the most expensive chairs either looked uncomfortable, had no arms, or would cut my legs.Then I found this one. $150 and it does all of that. And let me tell you, this chair does not look or feel any cheaper than the $300 counterparts. And it's big. Spacious. And it sits TALL! I am no longer on the floor in this chair. I actually sit above my desk. It's only about 5 inches difference but I am typing way better than normal and I can actually see my keyboard because there is no screen glare. The seat itself is not so long it hugs the kneepits, which is good because my other 500lbs rated chair does, and it's uncomfortable.Basically, I am loving this chair so far. It's sturdy as hek.There were 2 hiccups when it came to building it though. The person who labeled which screws were which is an idiot. I kept using the M screw when I needed N, kept using Q when I needed O. Just pay close attention to the labeling and you'll be fine.Also, the arm rests were about an inch too long. I had to sit in the chair and lean back to get them slotted so I could screw them in, but it's designed to fit for wear, so it's ok.10/10 WILL buy again. It's only a matter of time.",

                "reviewText": "51 year old big guy, last chair was rated for 400 pounds, but while I'm up there (about 370), I'm not quite there yet. That chair broke, but mostly due to the recline only supporting one side. The resulting twisting that happened cause the back to break so it couldn't support anything.I wanted my next chair to not have a recline, or be better supported or centrally located. Couldn't find one, saw this looked nice and comfy and rated for 500 pounds it also looks like the fancy chairs you see in Big offices, never liked the whole gamer chair thing.On to this chair, it's very nice and very comfortable there is a slight side to side rock, but i expected it to have some. Everything attached to the chair is either steel or wood with inserts. everything screws into metal, so I recommend thread locker for everything you screw together, I used Loctite blue for my assembly. As far as the assembly, I did it solo in about an hour, give or take 10 minutes either way (didn't time it sorry). The hardest part was joining the seat and back together, I set them up like a pyramid (/\\) and just moved them around (using my lower leg as a support under them) until I got the screws started), I left the base and everything nearby loose to allow everything to be aligned before tightening. I heard of issues with the arms getting mounted, but the inserts were very pronounced and easily got to, they were the easiest part next to the base and wheels.As far as the overall comfort it's nice, except for the lumbar support. There is no real issue with the Lumbar support, but it's my first chair with a permanent one. I've had the little pillow and just chunked it because i did not like it. Looks like I'm stuck with this one, so well see if i get used to it. At 370 I didn't expect the shock to even move when i sit, but it does move slightly (can feel it, but not noticable when sitting, heard it can eventually leak down, so got an upgrade on my wish list to pick up when that happens.Overall satisfied for now, we'll see later. As for the lumbar support, it sticks out about an inch, inch and a half out, it's just something you either like or don't like and have to get used toI'll update in a few months to let you know if it stands the test of time",

                "reviewText": "I want to preface my review by saying that at the time I bought this chair I weighed 280 pounds, well within the limits this chair proclaims to support. I bought this chair June 2022 and am writing my review 5 months later.This chair was okay while it lasted. The padding on the back and bottom were comfortable and the seat is both wide and deep. It also holds its height well.Unfortunately it's also broken down fast under daily use. The screws securing the base of the chair to the wheels don't want to stay in despite how much I tighten them. I've found stray metal pieces on my floor from where they've broken off.I tend to put more weight on my left side while sitting. Within a couple of months this chair reflected that- the padding was more worn on the one side which is fine and honestly something I'd expect. What I didn't expect was the entire chair to lean to the one side. Tightening the screws helped level it out for a day or two before it went back to leaning heavily to the left.The arms to the chair tend to loosen very fast, too. The manufacturer did warn that you will to tighten the screws now and again but I didn't expect to have to do so with frequency. It feels like every time I tighten them the arms to the chair are loose.Speaking of the arms of the chair the right arm has broken. The metal piece that the screws secure in to broke in half, and I fear that though I've managed to keep it from falling completely the top half is soon to follow.",

                "reviewText": "Got the chair today and assembled it. Nice and comfy - I'm a cross legged sitter so I went with the oversized chair and I can cross my legs comfortably within the arm rests no problem. Was a bit bummed that it was delivered with a small rip in the chair but not really noticeable and doesn't effect the use of the chair.It was too wide to carry through the doorway of my house so I'd suggest assembling in the room you're using it in or move before adding the chair arms to it.",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this chair. I am a large man at 6' 2\" and weigh in at a hefty 240 lbs. This is the first time that I have ever owned an extra large chair and I can't believe how much more comfortable my large chair is.If you are a large person, you are really going to want this chair. Once I replaced the castors, I couldn't be happier with the chair.The casters that come with the chair were single wheel hard plastic that were shedding little bits of black plastic that were getting ground into my hardwood floor.I ordered a floor mat for the chair but it still kept shedding and the plastic bits were still finding their way onto my floor. I threw the floor mat away.Finally, I ordered a great set of double wheel castors for the chair. With the addition of smooth rolling and super quiet castors, this chair is now 10 stars!I highly recomend this chair but be prepared to change the castors. It is worth the extra cost.I paid about $40 for the replacement casters. Just add the $40 to the chair price for your comparison shopping and you will find that the chair is still very competitive. Aside from the castor issue, the chair is excellent quality and with the correct castors you will find your new chair super smooth and super quiet on hardwood floors.I cannot give you the name of the castors as my review would be rejected. But the ones I purchased have two wheels per caster, are transparent in color, and have a texture like rubber. Two wheels per castor splits the load in half for each wheel greatly reducing the load between the wheels and the floor making the chair motion smoother.Good luck with your chair hunting and if you are willing to cough up a little extra for better castors, you will not be disappointed with this chair.",
