                "reviewText": "High quality office chair. Thick cushions make it extremely comfortable. Made from a nice quality PU leather material. Closely resembles genuine leather & doesn\u2019t feel cheap. Has all the adjustable functions you\u2019d expect from a good office chair. Gas lift, height adjusting lever & tilt knob for smooth rocking motion with a deep lean. Tilt can be locked/unlocked with lever by pushing it in/out. What makes this chair stand out is that the armrests can be lifted completely up & out of the way. This is great for someone who frequently gets in/out of their chair, but also allows me to push the chair completely underneath my desk. Saving valuable space in my small home office. It does sit about 2\u201d shorter than all my other office chairs. At the tallest height, it\u2019s about 19\u201d from floor to seat. I\u2019ve found most standard office chairs are 21\u201d. Even though it\u2019s only 2\u201d, it is a noticeable difference that I\u2019m sitting in a lower position at my desk. I guess this would be great if you have a small desk or for someone shorter than 5\u20195\u201d or maybe a child. At its lowest point, it\u2019s just shy of 16\u201d floor to seat. I\u2019m still in a comfortable position for work. It just feels odd to have my hands rest slightly raised above my elbows when at my keyboard. It was mostly easy to assemble. The instructions were easy to follow & the parts clearly labeled. All the parts were stored in a zippered compartment on the backrest before assembly. The only problem I ran into was attaching the armrests. You will need 2 people at this step. I had to hold the armrest in place while my husband put in the screws because it was impossible to do it alone. Even then, the screws were difficult to put in with the included Allen wrench. We had to use one from our toolbox because the included wrench kept slipping & almost stripped out the head on the screws. The metal base is sturdy. Wheels roll smoothly across my hardwood floors & carpet desk mat. I love the cross pattern stitchwork. This gives the chair a very elegant & classy look. Overall, it\u2019s a great office chair. Do wish it were a few inches taller & would recommend making some modifications to the steps for attaching the armrests. I recommend attaching them prior to installing the base mount, so you can hold the backrest & seat together upright. This makes it a lot easier.",

                "reviewText": "The Office Chair arrived in one fairly small box. Pictured above is the Contance of that box. There are no legs, base or arm rests. After going through the instructions (only 2 pages with pictures) three times and then my wife also reading them, we both agreed there must be a second box? It was only after going online and asking for the missing parts and ultimately having another chair sent out, did we find a zipper on the chair back and inside the hollow chair back was all the missing parts.Upon re-reading the instructions a fifth time, we found a very small (fine print, everything else is in BOLD print), photo of a blank rectangle with a flap folded back and a small print \"please open the zipper.\"We have only used the chair a few hours, but it seems well made and is comfortable.It takes 2 people to assemble the arms to the seat & back and then takes a lot of twisting, grunting and grumbling to get it together. The alignment is difficult. I will update my review after we've used the chair a few weeks and I have taken a heart pill or Scotch to calm down. I think we are going to like this chair it's just the instructions could be more forthcoming.",

I'll try anything once, and Amazon's return policy is excellent. However, It is probable that i was sent a defective unit. Stranger things happen all the time. But, based on the directions and the cracking of the base plate to test if it leaned back... I think there is no QC, and this is just the product. I'll quote the directions in step 4 (see attached picture) verbatim, \"Caution: When you connect the armrest with the cushion, if the hole position of the armrest is not aligned with the hole position of the cushion, please force the armrest to align with the hole position of the cushion and install the screw\". This is a normal step when putting together a chair, usually the holes will be off maybe a millimeter or two max. The armrest was 2 inches away from the backrest before \"forcing\" them into position. That is enough slop in manufacturing to feed a whole hog farm. I did not own the chair long enough, about 30 minutes to put it together then take it back apart after a very short test, to test the longevity of the hydraulics. The base of the unit, hydraulic bottle, wheels, supports, and plate seemed like they were of decent quality to good. The chair portion was abysmal. Buyer Beware.",

                "reviewText": "I work from home 60% of the time now, so I thought it was time to upgrade from my kitchen chair.When we opened the box, at first we thought we were missing some pieces. Upon further investigation, the back of the chair unzips and there's a space there where some of the parts were packed.We aren't the handiest people in the world and weren't trying to rush, it took about a half hour for one person to put this chair together.I'm 5'11 and I was pleasantly surprised to find the chair is tall enough for me to sit in comfortably with my feet flat on the floor and legs are supported. The seat is also quite wide; I am plus sized, and there's more than enough space for me to sit.On the negative side, the back seems kind of short, it barely reaches armpit level. The arms, while they do flip up out of the way when you don't need them, you cannot adjust the height. When I'm sitting up straight with my arms bent 90 degrees, my arms don't touch the armrests. While I'm tall for a woman, many men are taller and this wouldn't be comfortable for people much taller than me.In my office location I may sit for hours without getting up, and I would probably not find this chair suitable. But since it's in my home office, I am more frequently getting up and moving around so its support/padding isn't really a huge issue.Overall, not a bad chair for the price ($199 at the time I ordered) but not one I would sit in for hours on end.",
