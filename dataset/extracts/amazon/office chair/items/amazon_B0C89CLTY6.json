                "reviewText": "Been using this for a few days. I will follow up after a few months.Some quick points:- This is not a big and tall chair even if it can hold 400lbs.- Some people complained there was no instructions. There was in the box I received. It was in the same box as the washers and bolts.- I am 6'3\" and 250 lbs so I wanted the 400lb capacity, but the big and tall chairs I have tried were too big- especially the seat.- My main chair in my home office is the Steelcase Gesture- I got a great deal on prime day. I did not want to spend as much money on this chair as it will be used in an office at a summer cottage.Pros:1. Comes in a managable box2. I did get instructions with mine. Plus videos available online.3. I found the shaped seat very comfortable with good padding. The shape makes it seem like you are sitting in vs on the chair.4. The back is low, but the shape gives me excellent lower back support even without a lumbar support.5. Its mostly plastic, but it seems like is some kind of fiber or glass filled plastic. Feels strong.6. The connection between the back and seat is very rigid. Thick plastic and metal. the metal is boxed to make it even more rigid. Previous chairs I had used really thick bar stock which doesn't keep the back vertical over time.7. Assembled chair is pretty compact. Good for tighter spaces.Cons:1. Casters are cheap. I might upgrade.2. Getting the back attached to the seat was a pain especially as you put the armrests on before you attach the backrest.3. The buttons to adjust the arms are a bit suspect.",

                "reviewText": "For the price, I'd give it six stars if I could. I'm 6'2\" and weigh more than 300 lbs (although that's going down steadily!) and sit at a desk for 7-9 hours per day. I decided to roll the dice on this, and it's paid off.Not only does it support my weight--the height adjustment works like a charm--but also it's just plain comfortable. The seat surface is more than wide enough for me and it's about five or six inches thick. The upward slopes on either side are surprisingly supportive. The mesh back feels great and provides plenty of lumbar support. A welcome surprise was just how far and easily it leans back. It's just the seat back that moves, though, not the whole seat itself. The armrests were the most surprising part--maybe I'm just starved of experience with with decent office chairs, but I've never thought of armrests as an addition to comfort. But I love these--the fabric is durable without feeling harsh, and they adjust up and down.I also love the relatively low profile of this chair compared to other big and tall chairs in this price range. I didn't want anything with a high back or that was leather since my \"office\" is in my bedroom. This chair is substantial enough to be seriously comfortable, but its mesh midback design also vanishes into my WFH set up when not in use. Love it.The only two complaints I have are that it can be a pain to attach the bracket to the bottom of the seat and that the seat surface could be a little longer front to back. For the first complaint, just attach the bracket before you've attached the seat back or arm rests. For the second, meh. I'm sure for most people it will be just fine--I just like to sit cross legged in my office chairs and it's only juuuust barely long enough.",

                "reviewText": "Had to replace my old office chair, where \"faux\" leather had flaked off here and there. Black blobs of plastic tracked all over the house. I searched Amazon for office chairs with a high comfort rating, with many, many ratings, and with ratings that went back several years. I even asked a question on Amazon if anyone had owned this chair for more than a year, and how was the back and seat cushion holding up. Top marks on both accounts. Assembling the chair took some concentration. I must admit, though, that the nicely packaged parts (bolt A goes with washer A; bolt G, with washer G) made it much easier. For those previous posters who have asked for assembly instructions, they are found in three places: On the shipping box itself; in the little white booklet that's packed inside the box; and on the Amazon site showing details of the chair. The cushion is VERY thick, and very comfortable and the mesh back gives great lumbar support. And it breathes. Nothing to peel off. The gas cylinder raises the chair up and down. It rocks back and forth until you lock it into place. And the tension spring adjustment allows you to adjust the strength of the rocking, if that makes sense. Of course, I've only owned it for one week, but so far, I'm impressed with its quality. Oh, and I lucked out and saw this was being offered on one of Amazon's flash sales, so I got an excellent price.",

Everything in the box was well wrapped and in perfect condition.Instructions were included on a printed sheet, as well as being printed on the inside flap of the box. Delivery to sitting comfortably was under an hour - most of which was unpacking and disposing of packaging.Assembly was easy. All parts are clearly labelled, with extra parts included, but not needed. The allen key is a solid \u2018real\u2019 tool - up to the work. It was pretty much impossible to cross thread a screw. Only one screw was a little tricky - the up/down lever got in the way - but was certainly manageable.The chair parts are solid and heavy. It\u2019s hard to tell if they\u2019re plastic or metal. The wheels could be better - but seem like they\u2019ll last a while.The seat is a little short from back to knee - for those of us with generous backsides. (Now I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s adjustable - I\u2019ll have to check.) But the mesh back is just flex enough to make that okay. Pushes me easily into a comfortably supported upright posture.All in all it\u2019s a comfy chair. One I\u2019m not even thinking about within seconds of sitting. Add to that the price - half of comparable chairs online - and this is an outstanding value.",

                "reviewTitle": "Best gaming/office chair within this price range",
                "reviewText": "I've tried numerous chairs within the 150-400 CAD price bracket and this is by fair the most value for the money you get. The cushion is the most comfortable I've tried so far and holds comfort when sat for long durations, perfect for either gaming marathons or long office shifts. The lumbar support is very solid as well. It is not overly stiff, and is located in the perfect location (some chairs have the lumbar support either way too high or way too low). I am 5\"11 and it's perfect for me, but if you are over 6\"2, under 5\"6 or have a long/short torso this may vary. The arm rests are very comfortable as well as they are sufficiently cushioned and are vertically adjustable. The back rest is also very comfortable as the mesh does not have too much or too little tension and provides breathability so your back doesn't sweat. Some of the main features of this chair in my opinion are the reclining tension adjuster which works flawlessly, and the reclining lock mechanism (you can adjust the resistance of the reclining feature which has a wide range and you have the ability to lock the recline at a specific position). I would also like to add that this chair is very high quality for the price. The majority of the chair's materials is rigid plastic, and the base is made out of metal. Stitching of the seating cushion and arm rest is surprisingly high quality as well. My only complaint is that this chair does not include a head rest as most chairs in this price range have one, however, it is not necessarily needed as the company obviously focused their resources on crafting a comfortable and high quality chair that is also extremely affordable. If they included the head rest, the price would obviously be substantially higher or they may cheap out on other vital components if they plan on keeping the same price. Overall, this is a 5/5 product on my scale. 1 star for comfort, 1 star for features, 1 star for quality, 1 star for ease of usability/assembly and 1 star for the insane value this product offers in this price range. I've tried some office/gaming chairs that are in the 450-650 CAD price range like the Clatina Mellet and the Autonomous ErgoChair Pro, and they don't even come close to this one.",

Max height probably comfy for 6\"3.Chair cushion nice and comfy. Better than my last one.Back support feels great. I like that instead of the rod you poke in to lock the slanting of the back, it's the latch you pull up or down. For so many chairs, the rod just stopped working after a while to lock the back.The rod piece is for adjusting the height. You turn it to do that.Assembly is pretty standard. This chair gets extra marks for including a spare of everything in its kit.Note 1: don't mess up on the screws.. the stuff they put on the screws to lock them will make it hard to remove and screw in again.Note 2: stay away from any PU leather chairs.",
