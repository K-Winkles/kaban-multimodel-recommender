When you spend the majority of your day at your computer, comfort is key. The low back design and foam molded seat and back provide lower back support for those who do a lot of typing. A pneumatic seat height adjustment lever lets you easily position the chair where you need it while the 360\u00b0 swivel gives you access to all of your work surfaces with minimal effort. This sturdy task chair has a heavy duty, 5-star black base with dual-wheel casters for effortless mobility. Spills clean up easily with water followed by a dry cloth. Whether you work from home or go into the office, this designer armless task chair is a great choice for any workspace.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using this chair for about a month. Overall really pleased with it. Narrow enough to (mostly) fit under a keyhole desk. Comfortable for working from home and rolls well on thin carpet. Easy to assemble. Feels stable.Several reviews I had read said it wasn't padded enough to be comfortable, but I haven't noticed it being any less comfortable than most office-type chairs - sitting for hours and hours isn't comfortable in any chair!Okay for price - I was able to get mine \"used - like new\" and from what I could tell it was brand new, just not in original packaging. Definitely worth it for the used price!",

                "reviewText": "I was worried that this chair, as thin as it was, would be uncomfortable. But it provides cushion and support at all the necessary places, especially the lower back, without looking like a couch. I got the chair in white, and it really is a lovely piece of furniture for only $80. The height is easily adjustable while sitting on it, using the lever under the seat. The chair took just a few minutes to assemble; there were only 4 screws to screw in, using the allen wrench that came with it. The vinyl is super soft, which makes me wonder how durable it will be, but for $80, if it gets a rip, I'll just buy a new chair!",

                "reviewText": "These are much better looking in person and the padding is a little bit thicker than it looks in the picture. Look far more expensive than they are. I first ordered two of them and my (handicapped) husband put them together in a matter of minutes. He really loved them with our new retro dining table. Love that they roll instead of scraping the floor. They glide easily and we're pretty hefty people. I was so pleased with my first purchase that I went back and ordered another two to make it a full set of these. Beautiful chairs, comfortable, glide easily... love that you can set your own height so that YOU are comfortable at any height table... I like my chair a little higher than my husband and these can accommodate your body type easily. Love these chairs. Update: It's been over a month now and I still hold these chairs in high regard. My contractors seem to walk in and sit in them every day and these have held up without a scratch. Also had a newly installed laminate floor and even with these brutes sitting on them, the floors have not been scratched, the chairs still look like new. Still consider them a great deal after more than a month of hard use.",

Arrivata intatta e con tutti i pezzi necessari per assemblarla. Comoda la leva per alzarla o abbassarla, resistente lo schienale, buono il materiale. Ad un prezzo superiore ai 100 non la comprerei, ma per il prezzo pagato va pi\u00f9 che bene!Vi lascio qualche foto di come \u00e8 adesso, trascorsi tre mesi di utilizzo.Se vi va lasciate un \ud83d\udc4d, spero di esservi stata d'aiuto !",
