                "reviewText": "Overall this chair is comfortable and offers decent support. The seat pad is not super squishy but is supportive and I like that it's contoured, it's not just a flat surface. Lower back support is good. Easy to put together. The two reasons I decided to try this chair is because it came in various colors (I got the blue) and had arm rests that you can lift up and out of the way if you want to move in close to the desk. I have not had any issues sliding off the seat like others have mentioned. It has a nice range of height adjustment. It does recline and also has a recline lock and tension adjustment. Not sure why others have said it doesn't recline?? Maybe the put the base on backwards??However it's not perfect but with a couple of add-on's it's very close. I added rollerblade style wheels which I ordered on Amazon to prevent any floor scratching issues on my wood laminate flooring. Also the fabric is a little itchy for lack of a better term. But the only place it bothered me was on my elbows. I often rest the point of my elbows on the arm rest and the fabric is very irritating over time. So I ordered arm chair pads on Amazon which should solve that issue. Even with the add on's it's still a good price. I guess very few chairs will be perfect but for the price this is a good chair. If it can hold up and last for at least a few years then it will have been worth it.",

It did work first time I sat in it, but when I actually started using it the handle no longer release the back. No help from the online customer service, in fact, there doesn\u2019t seem to be online customer service even though (unless I\u2019ve misunderstood) it is advertised and there is a link. So, not a 5 star review. EDIT: The manufacturer messaged me and asked me to respond via Amazon messages, but I couldn\u2019t figure out how to. In the meantime, my husband showed me that the chair does indeed rock back, I\u2019m just too small and lightweight to make it happen! So I\u2019ve gone back and updated to a 5 star review because it\u2019s a great price and a very nice chair.",

The seat cushion is not as comfortable and soft as I expected. After I seat around 30min, my butt hurts so bad. So I walk or stand up a little bit.5. After u assemble it, have a cute chair for maybe one or two days. After that, use the cover!! Because mine got a stain within a week. I tried to remove it, but no luck. I wish I used a cushion cover earlier.6. THIS IS IMPORTANT. The seat tilt doesn't work. I have to push with force to tilt it just a little bit (I know it has a tilt lock and it was unlocked). I'm 60kg so I don't think it is because I'm light either.",

I ordered it on August 22nd, 2021 I had this chair almost 2 years and it\u2019s held out pretty well. I don\u2019t sit in it 24/7 even tho I\u2019m a avid gamer but I sit it in around 3-4 hours a day and with pretty much 600+ days of gaming in it this chair has held up well. Assembly was pretty easy took me 15 minutes but that\u2019s subjective to how fast you could think or how well you use your hands. Overall the chair is sold the armrests are a bit itchy but that\u2019s also subjective to your skin sensitivity, but the main knocker from 5 stars is that the armrests are pretty easy to loosen and can be a hassle some times. One of my armrests are completely loose and I just stopped tightening it because I stopped caring, but nonetheless is a good chair and it\u2019s surprisingly strong.",
