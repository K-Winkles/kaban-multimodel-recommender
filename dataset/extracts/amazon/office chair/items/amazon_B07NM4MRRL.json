                "reviewText": "I would like to say that I ordered this chair and I was a little skeptical at first but once I got it together and I sat at my desk it is a very comfortable chair and I weigh 330 lb and I'm 5'6 and this chair is immaculate. It is very comfortable with the lumbar support at my lower back and with the durability and the heavy duty cushion that it has I really like it. I do have to say it is a little high considering what I thought it would be I thought it would be a little bit lower than what it can do but for the chair itself I can't ask for a better chair. If you're looking for a chair that you're going to sit in for hours at a time at a desk or if you're in an office and you have to be in a chair this is something for a heavy set person to use because the width of the chair and the height and the stability of it is awesome. Putting the chair together took maybe 30 minutes and it's not that heavy the and the instructions are very detailed in what to do",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this chair for a second time. For some background, I ordered this chair because it said big and tall. I am 5'10 and just over 300lbs. I carry most of my weight in my bottom half. I work remotely from home and wanted something comfortable. This chair was it. I love this chair. I even sit in when I am not working. I bought the first one in July of 2021 and in Dec. of 2023, the tilting mechanism cracked. The chair itself was still in really great shape. The cost to replace the tilting mechanism and the gas cylinder would have been the same as if purchasing a new chair, which is what I did.",

                "reviewText": "I had to give this a 5 because the only thing wrong with it is I didn't pay attention to just how tall the lowest sitting level was. At 5'7\" My feet just touch the ground Maki it a nice sitting level but it makes it impossible for me to rock the chair backwards so I can take advantage of the tilt :( it's a big disappointment for me but not something that is the company's fault just my own for not double checking measurements. The chair is very nice, soft material and was easy to assemble. The massage was an added bonus as I didn't know it had that. Nice seat width to keep my legs from being pressed against them. Very satisfied so far with it.",

                "reviewText": "The first thing I noticed when I got the box was that this was much heavier than office chairs I've bought in the past. Upon checking the parts, it's obvious why. Everything about this is heavy duty. The leg/hub assembly isn't one piece plastic or thin extruded aluminum. The legs are thick walled tube that are bolted individually to the base. Likewise, the rocker plate is thicker than usual and the point at which the pneumatic cylinder slips in is a thick walled tube rather than just a hole. Great so far, but the pneumatic tube is the same crappy one this is all low end office chairs and within 5 months the seals started to give out Damn it just provide a straight pipe or maybe a threaded adjustment. I shouldn't have to pay 3 grand to get that feature. If you are a heavy individual and don't want to have to mod things to actually work, don't buy this.As far as the finished chair. I'm 400+ and this is comfortable. The seat feels cushioned enough for me and the lumbar support is firm. I don't have an issue with the arm frames pinching in, but if I were any larger that might be an issue. The reclining spring is heavy duty. On it's lightest setting I have to push down with my feet to recline, This isn't just going to fall back. Here's the thing. If you are under 300 this is likely going to feel too firm for you and you might not be able to recline at all. The massage feature was something I missed and didn't expect much from. It actually works pretty well for being USB powered. Don't expect miracles there though. The one area this falls down a bit in is the casters. Those are the typical hard plastic ones found on desk chairs. I ordered a set of upgrade polyurathane wheels at the same time and I'd suggest that for any desk chair, but especially if you're heavy. It'll roll easier and save your floor.There is some confusion in the comments about what weight this is rated for. It is really heavy duty. It's definitely good for well over 250 lbs so I suspect that number was in kilos. Overall, I'm happy with this. I've paid more in the past for supposedly heavy duty chairs that were just wider seats but otherwise the same light duty disposable crap. If you need a heavy duty chair, this should work if you can't afford a higher end one.",

                "reviewText": "This chair is definitely suited for a larger size person. I am 5\u2019 6\u201d and can only sit in it at its lowest level. When it is at its tallest position, even my husband\u2019s feet dangle, and he is 5\u20199\u201d. The width is great, and the sides don\u2019t press into my legs like my old chair. It has good back support and is comfortable enough. The cushion is a little stiff, but probably won\u2019t be with a bit of use. Our only real issue was with assembly! The pieces came in bags which were labeled\u2014just not correctly! The left arm was marked \u201cright\u201d and the right was marked \u201cleft\u201d. My husband had the base with wheels and pneumatic lift assembled in no time. He had the arms on (so he thought) and couldn\u2019t get the back to fit and spent quite a while trying to get it finished. We ended up having our handyman come over and he worked on it. He was about to say take it apart and send it back when he realized that the lips on the screw/bolt holes on the arms were not facing the correct way (outwards). When he reversed the arms of the chair, the back slipped right in and it went together in a snap. It was just frustrating that my husband spent so much time on it and we still had to pay someone else put it together. It does have a nice vibrating/massage function, but it is only on or off, no settings. The cord plugs into a USB port on the computer and goes into a pouch under the chair when not in use.",
