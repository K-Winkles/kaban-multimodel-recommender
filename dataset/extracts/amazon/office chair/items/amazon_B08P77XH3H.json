The chair felt comfortable and study. It was easy to put together. Wheels popped on. Four Allen screws for the seat bottom, eight Allen bolts to attach the arms, bottom, and seatback. I will update if it does not stand up to use.",

                "reviewText": "While this chair is good. After you've been using it for almost two years. The material will start to tear apart overtime. With this comes the first problem. The arm rests. As the material degrades. You'll find your elbows and arms being constantly poked by these fairly sharp metal spikes. Can be fixed if you wear a long sleeve shirt or put a blanket over the arm rests. Overall, the chair is alright. But I'd switch out for a better chair once your elbows and arms start getting poked by those sharp points in the arm rest. Support wise, it's alight, but might be a uncomfortable for taller people. It's comfortable enough you can sit in this chair for long periods, more than 5 hours.",

                "reviewText": "Always good to have history. It's 2009. New computer desks, file cabinets and office chairs. Today August 2022, same computer desks and file cabinets for home office.We use the 5th bedroom as an office. In 2009 we purchased low end $99.00 each (foolisly) office chairs. Try as we did, could not destroy those inexpensive vinyl chairs. In late 2017 the chairs were getting tired. Maybe we were also. We purchased on sale (2) La-Z-Boy leather computer chairs in January 2018 at $199.99. Thought they would last for many, many years. Hate to say the leather was so worn out when using these chairs max 2 hours per day in 4 1/2 years was very disheartning. What to do? Purchase 2 leather computer chairs however inexpensively. We came across these chairs however the reviews were terrible. What to do? Purchase them and if the reviewers are correct, send them back. Well the following may be of value to folks looking for good looking, easy to assemble, leather chairs. These may fit the need. About 75 minutes to assemble both chairs. The rolling of the chairs, we have plexiglass runners under the chairs over an area rug on wood floors, no problems rolling. Pistons no issues, chairs hold position. We are probably average heights and weights. She 5'9\" 170 lbs, me 5'11\" 205 lbs. Only issue may be the installation tool provided. Gets the job done however we dropped it at least a 1/2 dozen times. Lastly, we chose brown to match desks and file cabinets. Various colors available. So far these are a tad harder than the La-Z Boys however we think with our use they will probably outlast the La-Z-Boys.",

                "reviewText": "One star-reviews are accurate. Not sure how I missed them before buying this poorly constructed chair. I think since I needed a replacement I only looked at the pictures of it. You do get what you pay for, its not a good chair. The assembly process was easy enough but the piston rod didn't function properly and when sitting in the chair it leaned to the right side. I thought maybe I put it together wrong. I double checked what I screwed in and everything was screwed in correct and tight and nothing was loose, but the chair was still leaning and when you moved around it creaked and felt like it was going to fall apart.The fake leather in the arm rests were thin and flimsy and seemed like they would burst at the seams. Overall it just felt cheaply made and poor quality. The back cushion of the chair was poking me between the shoulder blades and was just totally uncomfortable.When I requested to return it I couldn't get the defective piston rod to come loose from the base so I would need two boxes to return it. The seller said if the item wasn't damaged he would charge me $30 for the return. It was defective. There should be no charge. Since the base and piston were connected I needed a separate box. The seller never provided another shipping label for the second box when asked.I had to file an A-Z refund claim with Amazon to get my money back. Thank you Amazon. Based on all the other negative reviews, this chair should not be sold on Amazon. Probably the worst quality product I've ever bought. READ THE REVIEWS and decided for yourself. If the seller doesn't provide a second label to ship it back (or the option to take it to an Amazon return location), then I'm taking this to the trash dump where it belongs.",

                "reviewText": "My old office chair was literally falling apart so I needed a replacement. After reading reviews I decided on this one. My daughter is a large gal and I needed something that was a bit sturdier. This chair was advertised as being \"heavy duty\" and accommodating up to 400 lbs. I highly doubt someone 400 lbs. could use this chair and it far too narrow for a heavier person. I have had the chair for about a month and here are some of my thoughts:Pros: Stylish good looks: The leather is attractive and it looks like a much more expensive chair. Easy Assembly: It took me only a short time to assemble it and the instructions were easy to follow. Comfort: The seat and back are reasonably comfortable.Cons: The wheels are awful. They lock up and I end up just scooting the chair across the floor mat. It would be impossible to maneuver the chair on even the lowest pile carpeting. It does not recline to 110\u00b0 in rocking mode as advertised. It is very tightly sprung and takes a lot of effort to tilt back. This may loosen up with time.In all fairness, I have not yet contacted the company regarding the wheels, but do plan to do so. It is too much of a pain to return the chair after having assembled it, so I plan to keep it, but if I had tried it in a store I would never have purchased it.",
