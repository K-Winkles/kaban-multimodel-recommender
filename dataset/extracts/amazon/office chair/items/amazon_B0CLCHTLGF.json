I've tried so many different chairs and all have become uncomfortable by the end of the day. Some even leave me in pain. So when I see one that looks like it would be comfortable, I order it.I ordered this one from Amazon and assembled it as soon as it arrived. It is big and heavy. There are relatively few parts that are easily assembled using the 19 bolts (if my memory serves me right) and the hex key provided. No other tools are needed. The instructions, while brief are adequate for even a novice. Assembly took me less than 1/2 hr. and no assistance was needed.The chair is tall, wide and very comfortable. The padding on the back, seat and foot rest is stiff but pliant. the chair height, armrest height and back angle are all adjustable and the footrest slides out and flips into place from under the seat. The leather like vinyl seems durable and the contrast stitching is very handsome.I've been working for several hours straight now and I feel very relaxed in this chair. This one seems like it'll work out.",

                "reviewText": "This chair took me about 45 minutes to put together by myself so having an extra set of hands might help, especially when having to flip it over at times to install the arms and also aligning the main lever/mechanism into the wheel base.I used my battery operated drill driver with this instead of using the provided allen wrench when first getting each bolt set into the chair, but then used the wrench for hand tightening at the end to prevent stripping the head of the bolts.The material feels high quality and the stitching all looks well put together.The padding is real thick and the chair is very comfortable and may be adjusted to swing back easily or with more tension (or not at all). The chair also comes with an additional leg piece that slides underneath and out of the way when not in use as well as a pillow should you want to take a rest or use it as a lumbar device.The set did have a broken piece when arriving with the telescoping cover and rubber gasket but there were additional gaskets in the tool pack and the cover does not affect the chair going up and down so it was not a major concern for me in my home office.",

                "reviewText": "The seat cushion is firm in the middle where you sit, but less firm on the edges so you may tend to sit to one side. This is a bigger issue than I initially thought.Assembly was straight forward and easy until the last step (Attach backrest to seat bottom)- I attempted to slide this in but the backrest spring makes this gap narrower than expected (even with the mounting bracket \u201cI\u201d adjusted all the way out)- I wrapped the plastic back around the bottom of the backrest and it did slide in much easier- Some minor tweaks to get all the bolts to align and tightened- I then removed the plastic coverThere is an extra pillow that is not shown on the product pageIncludes the footrest which moves smoothly, I just have not really had a use for itThe arm rests are ambidextrous (fit on either side), they are adjustable with 7 height optionsThe pneumatic lift raises the chair to typical heights, high enough for me to be comfortable at my deskCost at time of review $299.00Overall, I really do like this chair, it is very comfortable. The seat cushion firmness issue is a bit annoying. After a few days, you really notice the seat cushion and I end up not sitting straight up as I am sliding off to a side",

It's a very big chair and easily takes up some space, i got this as i have chronic back pain and work from home in front of a computer. For me the most important thing is support and comfortability. This chair hits those keys and provides more, the chair is really nice and the materials are great, the padding is stiff but still pliant to fit you and the stitching looks great and adds some fanciness to the chair. The leg rest works great and supports me easily and can be put away very easily.",

This is a chair that I recommend for those looking for something that they will sitting in for long periods of time. However, if you don\u2019t use your office or desk that often.
