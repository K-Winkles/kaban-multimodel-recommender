Love the fold up arms, but they could be a little lower when they are in 'arm rest' position; feels like I have my arms up wading through water, instead of resting at my side.No idea how it will hold up. If it lasts 5 good years before breaking down and getting uncomfortable, this is worth the price I paid (currently the chair is around $120).",

It rocks but takes a lot. Im 230lbs and I have to force it to rock .You can lock it in rear rock position. Love the folding armrests. Fits under the desk with that feature. Thigh support is short. Like alarmingly short. Enough to make it #1 measurement I pay attention to on future chairs. Was never a problem before this. School, work, home.",

The armrests are a little high for a \"shorter person\", but perfect for someone 6' or taller. Fortunately, they move up and out of the way, if needed. Very happy with my purchase.",

Unfortunately the chair is super uncomfortable after sitting in it for a couple hours. My lower back starts to hurt and my neck hurts because of the way the seat back is curved. Really disappointed since it costs so much!!",

                "reviewText": "i love that the arm rests fold up, as a bigger guy i struggled with that with my last office chair. Armrests are VERY comfy, lets see how it holds up over time, i like the color and its very soft to the touch. i like the lean back on it although i agree with someone else on the reviews its a little odd to have to reach that far back to \"lock \" it into place. my arms are barely long enough to reach it, if they weren't then i think i would return it. support could be better but its still good in my opinion.Last and most important thing that i want to note and let eveyone know is that it does made sounds, if this is something that will eventually go away but its pretty loud for me, if i lean back and then come back to type i hear a loud pop or snap at the base of the chair. i have looked for a while to try to find where the issue is but have had no luck. I sent the vendor an email about it today so i will let yall know what they say. i have more positives on this chair than not.",
