I\u2019ve sat in a lot of chairs of this sort over the years so it\u2019s not too special in regard to being phenomenal. I like that it\u2019s a mid-back support so it\u2019s not pushing on the back of your head. Mine however feels as if it\u2019s got a bit of a lean to the right (not by a lot) but enough to notice. I\u2019ve used it for remote work at home at my workstation and sitting in it for 8 straight hours was good too as to where some other chairs can make you sore.I\u2019m a bigger guy myself so the width of it from armrest to armrest is perfect for me. You can lean back in it or lock it so that it doesn\u2019t lean back as with most chairs in this category. The height adjustment is effortless and it\u2019s perfect under my desk when I scoot it in. I honestly thought this chair was going to fall apart after a few months of use but almost a year later it\u2019s been holding up nicely. The cushioning is nice as well so I would recommend this for bigger people as well if you need something wide.",

The seat leans forward so you\u2019re always sitting on the edge having to slide back. If you need a chair for multiple hours of use daily, find a different one. It\u2019s pretty but not worth the back/spine pain in the long run.",

                "reviewText": "It was not fun putting this together, but once put together it's a functional office chair capable of accommodating a tall adult. I picked this up for my son, who at 6' is not THAT tall but tall enough, and like many folks he is still working from home...and sitting in his chair all day, every day. The adjustable recline is a good feature. The armrests are not incredibly comfortable, which you. might guess from the picture, but we weren't expecting it to be quite as uncomfortable as it is - I feel like the flat design might have been an aesthetic choice rather than a rolled one, which might have gone easier on the arms. We've fitted ours out with some arm pads for office chairs, which goes a long way to making these usable for hours at a stretch but at an additional cost of about $30.",
