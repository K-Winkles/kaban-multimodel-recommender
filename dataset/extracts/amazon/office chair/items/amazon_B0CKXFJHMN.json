The surface is smooth and comfortable, not too cold not too warm. The best part is the curve of the chair which makes my back feel much more comfortable when sitting for a long time. The wheels are also good, which makes it easy to move and not making too much noise.",

                "reviewText": "On the first chair I received, the holes drilled into the bottom of the seat didn't line up with the holes on the metal base plate that had to be attached to it with screws. That was the first thing I checked since the chair couldn't be assembled if it couldn't be attached to the base. The chair is also very tightly packed in the box. Everything was very beat up in shipping, and the box was so bad I don't think I could have returned it if I wanted to. After I contacted the company by email, they replied to me promptly the next day. After a little correspondence, they gave me a discount and shipped me a new chair. That chair arrived in good condition, and could be assembled properly. It was a different color than the chair I ordered, but I'll live with that. Seems to be a good, comfortable chair. Very good customer service from the company.",

I saw all the five star reviews so I took a gamble. It was pretty easy to put together. That's a plus for me. The look is nice and the faux leather looks luxurious. It's quite large, which is good. It's rated for 500lbs so I figured it would be a great fit. The cushion isn't as comfortable or supportive as I thought it would be, it makes a lot of noises when sitting in it and it just doesn't feel very sturdy. For a chair with such a high weight rating, I expected to be much more sturdy. Overall, I don't feel it's worth the $289.99.",
