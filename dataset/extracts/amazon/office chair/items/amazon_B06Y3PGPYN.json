                "reviewText": "I've been using a gaming chair in my home office for years. While it was very comfortable it always felt cheap. It creaked and multiple parts broke, including the stem for the gas piston. While the company did honor their warranty it still meant I spent many days without a comfortable office chair. Finally my dog got his collar stuck on the recline handle and broke it out of warranty. This time I decided to go the office chair route. This was one of the few on my short list and it had 1 day shipping. 21 hours after I ordered it had arrived. Box was in good shape. Putting this chair together was breeze. This chair is very adjustable so I spent some time adjusting everything to my liking. Ergonomically everything fits just right. However, and I suspected this from the pictures, the padding in the seat is quite stiff upon arrival. That meant this chair was uncomfortable.. at first. Now that I've had it over a week, and added the HON headrest, the comfort level is rising. I think over time as the foam becomes less stiff the level of comfort will continue to go up.tl;dr: Upon arrival I probably would have only given this chair 3 stars but it has increased to a 4 after a week of breaking it in. Hopefully my prediction is correct and I can increase it to 5 as time goes by. I'll update if/when it becomes relevant.Update: After a month, the padding has been thoroughly broken in and my sitting experience is an enjoyable one. Fifth star earned!",

                "reviewText": "I read & browse daily for hours online. My old chair was slipping in height and really not good for support or general comfort.Overall: This Hon 2.0 is roomy, easy to assemble, supportive, well made & quite comfortable.Fit: I'm 5'6 - my feet in a mid-height position rest comfortable on the floor (I have long legs) and there are height options should I like to adjust. The seat is roomy, comfortable & supportive under my quads towards knees. In the seat forward/or back back position, even more so. I can tuck my feet under & use base spokes to rest my heels.Mechanisms: Everything is fairly smooth. Needs some pressure even when tension is released to tilt back - that's mostly fine - adds to support.Assembly - major chair parts were packed in protective thick plastic. Seat part is fairly heavy. The tool to bolt seat to back is included. Parts were undamaged & sturdy. The only real difficulty I had was snapping wheels into base. Using a hammer to help (only one wheel snapped in with hand pressure) required a few try's, till they were secured. No damage at all using this method.What I like: Comfort & support. A solid roomy chair with a slim profile. Arm & height & depth adjustments work well & relate to function & need. Seat cushion & back mesh is comfortable & accommodating. Lumbar support is supportive and not intrusive. All chair movement & adjustments available are functional though tilt could require less pressure$$ = value for sure.",

                "reviewText": "Just like my momma always said I'm not good at many things, but one thing I am good at is sitting. In fact, I'm a bit of an expert in the subject and humbly consider myself something of a chair connoisseur. A seat savant. A bench boss.So let me be your sedentary stentor of seated stuff and share with you my thoughts on this functional, attractive, and moderately priced chair from HON.PROS:+ Stretchy backrest provides support that conforms to your back and breathes well to help you avoid nasty back sweat.+ Adjustable lumbar support gives some added structure for your lower back (could be better - see below).+ Foam seat bottom is comfortable even for those of us not gifted in the posterior area (I did add an extra memory foam cushion for some added comfort).+ Great adjustability across the board (seat height, back angle, recline tension that can be locked into position, seat bottom rotates in proportion to the back angle, armrest height (I added foam covers to cushion my elbows since I actually use the armrests), and lumbar support position (limited adjustment and made from hard plastic somewhat contoured like your lower back)).+ Casters roll easily with no friction making it easy to move around. You may want to consider a rug or mat to protect hard flooring or change the casters out to urethane rollerblade wheels (not included).+ Materials and design are attractive with different colors to suit your office environment (home or work). Easy to clean and should age relatively well, but do be careful with sharp objects around the mesh seatback material. Time will tell if the stretchy mesh will lose its springiness or if the foam seat cushion will flatten over time.CONS:- A bit pricey (but much cheaper than the chair designs that HON so blatantly borrows from).- Horrible packaging (loose pieces in the box can damage the delicate mesh seat back or scratch the finish on the plastic pieces).- Weak lumbar support (I added a foam lumbar cushion in between the lumbar support and the mesh back for added support with some cushion).- Plastic legs have been known to snap according to other online reviews. Be mindful of the weight limit. I haven't had any issues myself.- Questionable quality control (the first chair I received had a portion of the mesh on the seat back damaged with no visible damage to the plastic in which the seat back was enclosed. To me, this indicated that the damage was likely there when the chair was packaged. I couldn't get a replacement back sent to me so had to send the original one back and have a new one shipped to me. This was at no additional cost to me, but did take another week.).If you're looking for a smart alternative to the Herman Miller Aeron chair that won't require you to get a second mortgage on your house then definitely give the HON Ignition 2.0 a look. There are cheaper options out there, but for me, this chair struck a good balance between design, material quality, and price to support my broken back and bony derriere. With Amazon's return policy you'll have an opportunity to try out the fit and feel for yourself. Just make sure you check the quality of the parts before you spend time assembling the chair.",

The box was taped when it arrived, but the chair was in perfect order.I contacted the company and they immediately sent out a replacement. I have the chair together, it was very easy to assemble, and it works perfect. Because the base came attached to the chair it feels solid and quiet. Quiet being the really important part for me. My last chair was comfortable, but really noisy no matter what I did. Since I work from home and other work night shift in the house, I need quiet not squeaky. Great chair worth the money. The Large Removable Computer Chair Covers fit perfectly and look great on this chair.",
