                "reviewText": "Recently the legs of my previous chair an Amazon Basic chair(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FM66MSY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) got bent so I was looking for a new chair. I was browsing the big and tall chair selections and this one seemed to have the most promise. I ordered and received it rather quickly, shipping was A+ but thats not exactly the manufactures doing thought everything was nicely packaged for sure!As I was building the chair I had a sneaking suspicion that it may be a tad on the small side all things considered. In the Amazon Basics chair I can fit a balled up fist between my sides and the arms of the chair, that is not the case with this one. I felt like a lego man in the chair where it was a perfect snug fit which for me is my main issue. I compared the measurements and they were not to drastically different i think maybe an inch or two tops on width. Even though it supports up to 400lbs I would say if you are 350 and lower you will love the chair, its comfy, looks sleek, and stable! I will say that I am a huge fan of the wheels I bought the same type as an addition to replace the factory wheels with my last chair and they are a massive improvement on carpet or hardwood flooring.All in all Assembly wise was easy, the tool that comes with the chair is an allen wrench with a handle which coming from someone who has assembled dozens upon dozens of office chairs it saved my fingers/hands for sure.Assembly 5/5Shipping 5/5Parts/Tools 5/5Comfortable 4/5All in all a great chair just a tad to slender for my liking personally, ended up just using the base with my Amazon chair that I linked and it worked great. So again if you are 350lbs or lighter I am sure it will fit and be comfy!",

                "reviewText": "Took off a star because of how much the back of the chair leans back is just uncomfortable to work with and my back has been hurting because of it. Considering returning it if I canI have next to my old chair, that as you can see is wearing out, in the pictures to show the difference in height and arms. My old chair was way more expensive than this one so I knew quality wouldn't be the same, but I do have say it is a nice looking chair just a couple of comfort issues.The back is in a more of a reclining position than I like, I will need a pillow for my back since I like to sit up to work, but when I recline back it is very comfortable. Seat is stiff but I am sure it will break in over time but for the most part I find it comfortable to sit on. I misread the 30 in height to be from the seat but it is actually from the bottom of the seat, My head sits fine on the cushion but it does go a little above the top of the cushion when I rest back. I am 5ft 8 and weigh 270 lbs if this helps any. I have the chair at the tallest setting and I can rest my feet flat although the seat cushion does cut into the back of knees, I was afraid it was going to have to sit lower but not an issue. I sit in the seat fine but if you have wider hips you may not like it. It doesn't come close to the comfort of the more expensive chair but for the price it is a pretty decent chair.",
