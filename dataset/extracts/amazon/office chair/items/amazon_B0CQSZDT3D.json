Upon assembling, I discovered several scratch marks on it. Also, the instruction should have be more clear. Took me 30+ mins to put it together and realized I had the base in reverse position (leaning forward when sitting on it). It would be be if they mark it on the bottom of the seat with an arrow point the front side. No extra screws or covers at alI. Pray that you wouldn't lost any of them. Not much of a back support. Also, the design of the seat is curved outward. Not inward. Not sure why. Maybe expect people to sit in a wide open position. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffcMay want to invest in a lumbar support pillow or just spend some more money and get a better chair. I would like to return it but it's way too much work to take it apart. I will just take the loss. So, beaware of these issues.",
