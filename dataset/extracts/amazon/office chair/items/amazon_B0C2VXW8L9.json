                "reviewText": "Took around 30 minutes to assemble Simple instructions, easy to follow. This does incorporate an optional vibrating cushion, which needs to be attached via USB if you choose to use it. The cable is a 2-part cable, so if you forget it's plugged in and go to roll away, it should release rather than ripping your entire set up off the desk. (I know this from experience, lol) But, if you're using this for console gaming, the cable is not much longer than maybe 4', so it wouldn't be an ideal option for gaming at a far distance from the system being used, unless you've got another power source.Super comfy, I am 350 pounds on a good day, and while this does feel slightly tight, it's a good kind of tight. It's like a firm hug on my back.The fold out foot stool underneath is one of those tacky things that you'd never use if you're using this chair in an executive setting UNLESS you're anything like myself. I have ADHD, ADD and GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder)- needless to say, I fidget constantly. This chair is the perfect companion, I can re-adjust it time and time again and feel as thought I've changed how I'm sitting, which is extremely important to me and may be important to you! :) So if you're like me, just quit the search... I'm serious, I've gone through chairs from $700 + and have never been more satisfied with what I've spent than this one. Maybe a fluke, and of course if something changes I'll come back and update this review, but so far- I cannot express how happy I am with this purchase.",

Then I had to do the same to one of the screw holes for the back of the chair where you attach it to the chair bottom. Then, there is the left chair arm where it attaches to the back of the chair. Keep the hex screw handy, because you need it almost every other day when the arm loosens up. The foot stool piece is loose and not long enough to use comfortably. I am 5'1 and my feet dangle off. Last, but not least, the seat. It said memory foam, it must be the most uncomfortable chair seat I've ever sat upon. I have to sit at my desk eight or more hours a day working from home and by the end of the first hour it makes me ache all over from the seat up. I wish I had kept the 10 year old office chair that I threw away. If so, I would have returned this one for a refund. DO NOT RECOMMENDED!!!",
