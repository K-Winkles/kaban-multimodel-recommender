                "reviewText": "Husband had no problems putting this together. He said this chair was designed to be put together, meaning parts lined up, there was no forcing to make things work.. He said arms are usually the toughest and you are able to angle them easily. As for comfort, he said he could do with more lower lumbar support (not sure I saw someone else say there is lumbar support pillow if so we did not receive?). Hub is about 5'9 on lowest setting sitting all the way back his feet could touch, though barely (not sure he really had it on the lowest setting). I am 5'4, my feet touch the ground. Chair feels sturdy, and we are not skinny people. The transition for the height changing is smooth. You know how many chairs these days tilt forward in the seat area, this one does not!! First night we have had it, will update if anything changes and how things go with it. Oh comfort is fine, so far. I do not feel it is too firm nor too soft. But, I am not looking for a recliner, I want something I can sit in for 12 hours working (I know, bad for my health, but yeah).Edit: 1 year later, still holding up fine. The seat maybe could be more cushiony but I am very happy with this durability. 275 lbs has been in this chair daily for 10+ hours. Only thing I could honest recommend if they ever upgrade it is better seat cushion. It isn't bad, but could be better. That would knock this chair out of the park!UPDATE: First week: So far sturdy as an ox- I really like that. I need to get a cloth or a throw or something to sit on, because I wear shorts, and my legs stick to the seat when getting up (probably because I am in this chair far too long!). That is minor though as I am very happy with this chair. I have been sitting in it for 8-12 hours a day and having no problems. I also like the wide seat. Not that I need it, but I like to something kick a leg up underneath the other, and this gives me ample room to reposition myself or sit cross legged.",

                "reviewText": "So, I've had this chair a year. I'm big (240) and tall (6'4\") and I needed something that would give good back support. I like a chair that doesn't squeeze me to death and I hoped this would be it. It's passable, but has not been a great experienceMy first issue is the durability -- nothing has specifically broken, but I actually wore out the assembly key that came with this tightening the screws on the arm rests. They repeatedly and consistently loosen themselves. Loctite solved the issue, but it should have never been requiredThe reviews that say the chair makes odd creaks and pops are fully accurate. The chair makes concerning noisesDon't get your hopes up for the footrest unless you are 5'2\". My feet hang off of it so far that if I put my legs down on it I'm sure it would snap off or damage the chair. It's not usable if you're tall. If I ease my legs down on it, I physically see it bend. I don't use it. It extends a comically short distance to be a leg rest for tall peopleThe chair is plenty wide, but rear support is lacking. My butt feels numb sometimes from sitting a short period of time if I move even slightly the wrong way. The padding and comfort are less than a 1989 Nissan Sentra seat, and those were pretty sparse. A friend of mine described the rear support like sitting on a church pew someone placed a blanket on. I needed to add a small memory foam cushion to make it passableIt adjusts in many positions, but does not feel sturdy enough to fully lean back. This would be a great chair for someone 5'2 - 5'8\" and half my weight, but it is not good for a 6'4\" person. My brother (who is 6'6\") had an even worse time in it. Anything over 5'8\" is going to be marginal, anything over 6'0 is probably not going to be a good experience, anything over 6'6\" this isn't even an optionAssembly is easy and takes less than an hour. You will want to hang onto the assembly key unless you use Loctite, because you will be tightening this and tightening it again. I physically wore out the key before I went that routeSave the money and buy a specialty chair if you need it, something made of metal and sturdy. This is not the solution you want, not for current prices",

                "reviewText": "This office chair is superb. It is comfortable for long periods. I am 220 pounds and 5'11 the chair is spacious and I sit comfortably in whatever position. I love the reclining feature and the foot rest is excellent to lay back and take a nap during a break. I appreciate the good back support too. It was very easy to assemble. The chair is sturdy and good quality material.",

                "reviewText": "Only 2 issues that I have is that this chair creeks like it's an old car, and the screws all needed Loctite. No matter how well you put it together the arms kept coming lose. Loctite mostly solved that.But a solid chair 3 months in. And it looks real nice. Bottom support toward the inside is a bit thin, but you can get past that.",

                "reviewText": "So I really like the design of the chair, and it's fairly comfortable, but I've found that I need to tighten the screws on the arms and back almost daily. It's gotten to the point where I have to keep the allen wrench at my desk and tighten the arms every time I sit down. Once tightened the chair is great, but it just doesn't last long. I've had it for about a month now and I can't imagine it's going to last more than a year or so.",

If the paper instructions from the box are not clear, you have a video right here with this product. No need for extra tools either. The foot rest is very convenient and I love the recline. When you sit on the chair you push back to the desired angle and simply lock it with the handle underneath (easy!). After I was done putting it together last night, I sat on it to try it out and almost fell asleep. The only thing is that I wish I could bring it a bit lower because I\u2019m only 5\u20191\u201d and my feet don\u2019t touch the ground. Still, it\u2019s a small thing and I love it because it is so comfortable. Great for when I have to sit at the computer and do my work, and great for reclining and watching a movie.",
