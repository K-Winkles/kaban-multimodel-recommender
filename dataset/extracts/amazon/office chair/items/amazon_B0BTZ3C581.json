                "reviewText": "I am particularly glad that I bought the TWO Pack, just in case they do slip! As in the photo, I mounted them atop each other with about an inch above them, so even if that inch disappears, I still have a much better situation than without!I installed these four days ago and SO FAR, GREAT! I am NOT a light person (around 205 pounds) and these appear to be holding. I LIKE that they: 1) fit my 1+ inch chair tube as the ad says 2) come with some sort of plastic liner that is non-slip 3) have sturdy screws for severe tightening.I only gave them 4 stars for ease of assembly because I think they would be MURDER to install using the included 6mm hand held hex wrenches. Fortunately, I have metric wrenches for a socket driver. It takes TORQUE to fully tighten these that I doubt can be achieved with your fingers holding the wrenches, but they DO tighten with a good ratchet socket wrench!UPDATED February 4, 2024 - STILL HOLDING and I am NOT LIGHT! AWESOME! To those who still have slippage, MAYBE you need more torque when tightening. I used a high quality socket wrench!",
