                "reviewText": "So the chair was actually kind of difficult to put together when it came to getting the bolts into the back. It's definitely designed for 2 people to make it a bit easier, as I had to wrap my hand around both the back rest and the bottom to squeeze the two together to get the bolts in. Two bolts felt like they had stripped, but upon further twisting, they eventually locked into their final position (I'm guessing this is where some of the complaints about stripping come from, they just didn't twist far enough in...it's really surprising how deep the actual bolts go in, and how many turns it takes to finally settle them in).I will say the instructions were on a similar level to what La-Z-Boy provides, which is a nice touch. Easy to read, lots of solid details. They also came with a fair amount of extra parts, and the quality of the parts seemed decent. My only gripe is the plastic nubs to fit into the holes where the bolts go in, are not properly fitted, and most pop out on their own. It was very difficult to get them into place for the lower two sockets, and in attempting to force them into the upper holes where the moving armrest is ended up forcing me to use a small hammer, and I still couldn't get them to fit properly. Even swapping them out. I stopped trying as I ended up nicking the exterior slightly and did not feel like doing any extra exterior damage in a vain attempt. That said, they aren't really necessary. It looks fine with the holes around the movable armrest and the two bolts into the seat sealed off.The build quality is fairly decent. The exception seems to be the seat area. The sides and back of the seat have ample and adequate cushion and foam. However the center has almost nothing. I suppose this was a way to cut corners, and most large sized individuals tend to be thicker on the edges of their bums, rather than have more weight around the center, and most people will sit further back into the chair (were again, there is adequate cushioning). However once I move a little further into the center, as I tend to sit forward, that center cushion deflates really fast, and it's like sitting on a rock.The back support took some time to get used to. It's very thick foam in the lower back region, and it leans a bit backwards for what I'm used to (most of the chairs I buy are more straight backed). So it took a little time to get used to. It's not bad, but feels a bit off. I'm guessing this is designed to alleviate lower back pain, though it's a bit much, and pushes me forward, where when I lean forward into the seat, and given the angle of the seat's rear cushion, really pushes me into that center with limited cushioning. So I have to be very mindful of how I sit in this chair.I haven't had it long, so I'm not sure how well the foam will hold up. I had to replace a rather nice faux leather high back, but metal frame chair where the joint where the arm bolt is connected into the back is where some corners were cut (it's the width of the bolt itself, and of a lower grade material, not steel, so it broke with just a slight force application). This chair seems to be a bit more durable. However, it's plastic, with the only metal being the bolts and the screw holds meant to hold the thing together. So I'm not positive on longevity.The company that makes this chair is American, but its made in China. Though the quality is decent, and the thickness of the faux leather seems fairly solid, and difficult to rip or tear, though I'm not about to take a knife to it to properly test but some tugging and pulling indicates it will last awhile, even in dry weather.The rating itself is based on the price to quality. For what I paid, for what it is, it seems like a good purchase.",

The squishiness is just right, and I can lift the arms so they don't crash into my desk. I have accidentally spent close to seven hours in this chair and only struggled with my neck (because I do not look at my monitor properly, not because of this chair). Every time I use it, I am completely comfortable without feeling aches, stiffness, or numb butt/feet on the longer uses. Great buy! Worth the price, although I got it on sale at the time.",

This one does that. It was easily assembled for the most part. The only issue I had in putting it together was that it rolled too easily. I had to brace it against the box it came in while I was putting the arms on it. But that wasn't the chairs fault. The floor on which I was on while putting it together was a laminate floor that was very smooth which made the chair want to roll whenever I put the slightest pressure against it. Other than that it went together very smoothly. Very pleased with it so far.",

I asked for a replacement, they could not as the chair was out of stock... they offered to send me a new back, even though the base is the problem... they just dont really read or understand what the customer is saying. I asked for a discount, if I will be fixing the \"new\" chair I purchased... they said they cannot. So, quality control and customer service not so good...",
