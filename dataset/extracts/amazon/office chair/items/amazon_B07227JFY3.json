I feel like someone 200+ lbs would definitely break it. Just my opinion though. I\u2019m 185 lbs and I sat in it. I felt like if I sat in it everyday for hours, I would definitely break it. It has a beautiful design to it. I love the camo and that\u2019s what my son picked out. He says it\u2019s comfortable to sit in. I thought it was decent too for the price. If your looking for a chair that\u2019s inexpensive for a teenager or young child for their gaming setup, this is a good one to get!",

                "reviewText": "The Office Chair PC Gaming Chair is a decent choice for those seeking a budget-friendly seating option for gaming or office work. While it may not offer all the bells and whistles of higher-end models, it provides adequate comfort and support for extended periods of sitting. The chair features a sturdy build with adjustable height and a reclining function, allowing users to find a position that suits their needs. The included lumbar support and headrest cushion provide some level of ergonomic support, although they may not be as customizable as more premium options. The overall design is sleek and modern, and the chair is relatively easy to assemble. While it may not be the most luxurious or high-performance gaming chair on the market, it serves its purpose reasonably well for those on a tighter budget.",

                "reviewText": "The chair is exactly what I expected for 60 bucks. I needed an inexpensive chair for a small desk in a room I rent, and this chair's dimensions were perfect for the limited space I have. Sometimes I need a place to get household paper work and grading done, and this chair suits my purposes. I won't spend more than 3-4 hours in the chair at a time, so this works for me. However, don't expect comfort or durability. The foam seat and back rest is pretty thin, and obviously not built for comfort. The chair is supporting you with 4 screws holding the seat to the frame, and 4 screws holding the back rest to the arm rests. When you sit in the chair, you can tell it's not very stable because you're only being supported with 8 screws. If you're the type of person who like to throw their weight into sitting down, this chair isn't going to last long. Also, the balance isn't good. If you lean back too far, this chair will fall over. Assembly was really easy, too less than 30 minutes to assemble. It gets 5 stars from me because it suits my purposes better than I expected, and it's what I expected for the price. A good chair for light use and not having an eyesore in your home office. **NOT A CHAIR FOR 8+ HOURS OF OFFICE WORK OR GAMING**",

It looks exactly like it was pictured, but the one downside to this chair is that the cushion seat that you sit on is very thin. When you sit down, you could feel the board structure so I had to put an extra pillow on top just so I wouldn\u2019t hurt my rear end. The padding on the back is great. I really liked the armrest because they don\u2019t move and they\u2019re very solid. Just wish it had more padding on the butt.",

                "reviewText": "Installation was actually quite easy and I thought the chair was pretty sturdy in the beginning. I quickly discovered that it leans back slightly with no way to control this function. So it provides absolutely NO back support while gaming if you are trying to sit up and pay attention to your screen. I was able to accept this flaw, because it was comfortable to lean back and watch videos and movies, but I soon noticed the slight lean was becoming larger increasingly! I broke out the instructions and double checked all the screws and everything was constructed properly, but there was no way to adjust! One day as I was relaxing and watching a movie, the arm snapped out of no where and I went tumbling head over heals backward!! I hit my head on the way down on my bed post and landed directly on my right leg. One thing I will share is I have a broken bone in my hip and I am awaiting hip replacement surgery, so you can imagine the immense and intense pain that I was in when I was suddenly catapulted backward and landed squarely on my broken right hip!! I didn\u2019t even realize that I was bleeding from my head bump because that pain didn\u2019t even measure compared to the blinding pain I was in from my right hip!I contacted customer service to find out if this was a common flaw in the manufacturing, hoping that perhaps they would offer to send me a new one or discount or something! I have NEVER seen a chair break in this manner before! They said they were sorry, but could not do anything to help me out with this obviously flawed product! They didn\u2019t even answer any of my questions about the product! They simply said that you are passed the 30 day return policy! This is not a warranty issue, it is a greater concern that you may have a dangerous product!Buyers beware!! Especially if you are purchasing this chair for anyone elderly or any small children!",

The weight limit is 250 pounds, and I am 240 pounds, which may have contributed to the break; however, I immediately notified the seller and within a couple of days a new arm had been delivered. Very pleased with this exceptional service. So while the back does lie back fully, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it as you could break the arm. Someone reviewing this product said that there was nothing to stop the back from leaning all the way back, but that\u2019s not true, there is a lever that you pull out and then push back in to set the bag at the desired angle.So I will just be careful not to lean all the way back anymore. But otherwise, this is a great chair, and you can\u2019t beat the price. The value is very good.",
