If you have a pipe wrench you can use that, but if you're like me and don't have one you'll either need to buy a pipe wrench or buy a specialty tool for the purpose. You can get an equally strong cylinder with the removal tool for the cost of this cylinder and a separate pipe wrench, and for less if you buy this cylinder and the specialty tool separately. I'd recommend saving yourself some effort by buying an all-in-one kit.",

                "reviewText": "Obviously you are the practical type if you are thinking about buying this. The think is, you need to be able to get the old shaft and cylinder off. Don't believe the manufacturer's movie, it's a joke! I have a good solid metal vice and was able to separate the tapered connections on each end using hammer blows and some wood to protect the chair. Relatively easy but it takes a little man handling (am I still allowed to say that?). What was really a problem for me was the first one I got sank to the bottom. There was also fluid leaking around the seal. However, it was no problem because I was able to get a replacement which works perfectly fine. It was just a bit more labor to take off the bad one and put the replacement on. This was actually an upgrade from the original because I got a longer shaft. Now I can sit higher up now which i prefer. It still goes down far enough when you need it to. This fixed a nice $400 chair that I was given, so I'm happy.",

Having said that, A 20 dollar replacement is still a lot better than buying a new 2 to 3 hundred dollar chair which is what I used to do. My actual chair is still in great shape material wise so even though it's not the best solution, I still ordered another one yesterday to replace the failing one.",
