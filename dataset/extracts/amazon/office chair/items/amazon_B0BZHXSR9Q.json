                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Logicfox Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair and I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase! This chair is a game-changer for my home office setup. The 3D armrests are incredibly adjustable, allowing me to find the perfect position for my arms and shoulders. The adjustable lumbar cushion provides just the right amount of support for my lower back, and the 2D headrest is a wonderful addition for those moments when I need to lean back and take a breather.The black high back design not only looks sleek and professional, but it also offers excellent support for my entire back. The tilt function is a great feature, allowing me to recline and take short breaks without compromising my comfort. The mesh backrest and seat are a dream in terms of breathability, keeping me cool even during longer work sessions.Assembly was a breeze with clear instructions, and the chair feels sturdy and well-built. Overall, I can't recommend the Logicfox Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair enough. It's improved my workspace comfort and productivity significantly. A definite 5-star purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I work from home, and I play video games on my personal gaming PC when I have some spare time.So, a comfortable chair is a must for me since I sit in front of my monitors for many hours. I thought that a gaming chair was what I needed, since a lot of my workmates were so into it, so I bought one.Unfortunately, what I bought failed to deliver everything that it promised, and its faux leather material was simply falling apart after just four months and was very uncomfortable to me, unless I covered the seat with some towel. I ended up giving away that gaming chair.A friend of mine suggested a mesh chair with lumbar support. So, I started looking here on Amazon.I looked at quite a few chairs and read their reviews until I stumbled upon this one from Logicfox. Its modernistic design along with multiple awesome features got me very interested, so I bought this.Installation was very quick and straight forward. I love the 3 lockable reclining positions and the adjustable lumbar cushion which has provided me some much needed back relief!The adjustable armrest is a great bonus! It's quite unique, since this is the first of its kind for me which allows for up and down, forward and backward, and even rotation adjustments.The mesh back and mesh seat allow for air to flow which in turn keeps me cool.In short, I really love this chair! It's very comfortable and stable and loaded with a bunch of amazing features! I very highly recommend this!",

                "reviewText": "The chair is very well built, looks stylish and easy to assemble. The back is tall enough for 6ft person. The wheels are rubber like, is which a plus over plastic as they glide easier and quieter on laminate/wooden floor. The arm rests have a lot of adjustability and do not wobble like on cheaper chairs.The reason for deducting 2 starts was the comfortability. It is not comfortable at all, as the back of the chair is sitting too forward, or the bottom piece is too far back. I wish there was either adjustably for the bottom piece (cushion) or it was longer. When sitting on the chair, if feels like you are sliding off of it and constantly trying to sit back.This chair was bough for home use, while at work we have Haworth Zody which is very comfortable (yes the price difference is substantial) however the bottom cushion is adjustable and from factory it sits more forward. If this was an option on Logicfox chair, I bet it would have been more comfortable, or unless you are smaller than 6ft, it might work well for you as well.",

It fits tall folks just as well as shorter folks.Assembly took maybe 15 minutes, and had great instructions should you get stuck.Used it everyday for 6 months, then the seat frame broke. The frame is made of Nylon I think, and the only thing I can think is that I just got one made on a Friday afternoon.I sent in an email to LogicFox customer support, and received a response within a couple hours. They didn't have the part in stock, but It should be available in a week or so. Today I got another response from them saying they would replace the entire chair. That is great customer service, something you just don't find often in office chair companies, and with a 3 year warranty your in great shape.I highly recommend this chair.",
