Always get compliments on it and everyone says it looks like a Tesla chair. The only negative is the cheap casters on them, they never really want to roll. Upgrade to better casters and this chair would be perfect. Great price and looks awesome",

I don't mind buying a used chair but it looks like they disassembled and threw the parts in the box and the plastic normally used to wrap the parts was tossed in on top. Luckily there were only a few scratches on the parts and it went together easily. Can't remember if it was listed as used but in the future it would be great if selling a used chair to package it better and re-wrap the parts before shipping.",
