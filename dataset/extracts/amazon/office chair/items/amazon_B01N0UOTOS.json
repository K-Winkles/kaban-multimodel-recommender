                "reviewText": "The chair is aesthetically attractive. It looks nice in my office. However, that is just the surface of what is nice about this chair. The seat is so comfortable. It is soft without sacrificing support. It is incredibly supportive on my back and hips. I was looking at another Serta chair until I sat in this one. I instantly knew I wanted it.When I work, I occasionally lay my head back to rest my neck for a minute. It was important for me to purchase a high back chair because of that. Part of the reason I sat in this chair to try it was because it was a high back. It had been a long day, and I laid my head...that is when I was sold. I felt like my head was resting on a supportive pillow, and I made my decision that I wasn't willing to get any other chair.Even the arm rests are nicely cushioned and supportive.This chair prices better than the original Serta chair I was considering, but cost is not even the reason I chose it. I would have been willing to pay more for this chair, but the better price is another bonus. I would definitely buy this chair again!",

I does have a little creek if sound as I lean back in it, but I can live with that, because my first concern was support. I have an adjustable height desk, which help to store chair underneath, due to the fixed arms. All-in-all a great product.",

This is a fairly big chair though, not for people under 6 foot, so pay attention to the dimensions. Also know that this is a traditional executive chair, so if you're looking for a nouveau mesh office chair with a thousand adjustments, this one isn't for you. But if you're looking for an authentic Serta that's good looking and all-day comfy at a good price, this is your chair.",

                "reviewText": "This is a $500+ chair. The plastic components are cheap and poorly formed. I had to enlarge the holes in the plastic arm frames so that the washers could fit into the holes. (And it wasn\u2019t a quick process- about 45 minutes.) Thankfully I had a drill and proper drill bit to do the work. Now that the chair is assembled, the arms wobble a bit (even though they are fully tightened- and I didn\u2019t affect the contact points of the screws/chair arms when I drilled- I was super careful about that) So, all is all, it was comfortable in the store where I tested it, but now that I\u2019ve ordered it and and assembled it, it\u2019s a disappointment. Not worth the price. (Also, the company ships via cheapest ground shipping (that\u2019s the free option). FEDEX promised it Wednesday, then Thursday, then out for delivery on Friday\u2026. Didn\u2019t arrive until Saturday, and I had to call FEDEX to have them locate the box. Some if this is FEDEX\u2019s fault, some of it is due the \u201ccheapest shipping\u201d selected by the company to maximize their profits) I would pass on the chair, and probably pass on the company too.",

                "reviewText": "I would have liked this to be cheaper. After buying I did see it on sale at office depot for less. But this is an awesome chair.. by far the best office chair I've ever sat in. I've had this for several months and it has helped my back (which would constantly hurt with previous chairs) and is as or maybe even more comfy than my couch. a most excellent chair, seat cushion is so plush.",
