Most of the chair was easy to put together but the arm rest will look off like it wont fit but you just gotta give it a streatch type of thing and boom it fits. The arm rest for me as you can see looks a bit off color but it had it on both sides and on one side i washed it with soap and it was back to normal so i think its just the tape rap. Overall im not that picky sooo this works just fine for me. I really like.",

                "reviewText": "If you follow the assembly instructions exactly, you will think the holes for the back were drilled in the wrong space. I found out that it is easier to deviate from the instructions in the following way and the chair goes together very easily. BEFORE installing the adjustment base, line up the two forward holes for the back and start the screws, tightening them about halfway. The metal flexes enough to line the holes up, then you can install the other two screws for the back. Leave all four screws only tightened about halfway. THEN install the adjustment base so that it overlaps the front part of the metal plate for the back. Screw all four screws in for the adjustment base at this point, then tighten the screws for the back the rest of the way.",
