The item arrived with no damage, and the assembly instructions were clear. I appreciate the extra nuts and bolts included. I initially questioned whether the plastic material would be strong enough; but once assembled, I found the chair to be sturdy and supportive. Everything came together without difficulty. The component and build quality seem very good. I am 5'10\" and 185 lbs: and I find the seat height adjustability, the seat cushion's firmness, the lumbar support, breathable mesh back, and swiveling headrest -- all comfortable. The recline feature adjusts to my preferred tension, and the arm rests swing up and out of the way easily, with the right amount of resistance. I have no problems working all day in this chair at my IT job. I can see why other reviewers mention the somewhat rough fabric on the arm rests, but it doesn't bother me at all. I would purchase this item again without hesitation.",

I weigh 220 Lbs, and I can feel it straining under my weight. So keep that in mind if you are a larger person. The color for this chair is Teal...even though it says blue. Looks great and I highly recommend it. Was shipped in a sturdy cardboard box with extra protection taped in...manufacturer did a great job protecting it.",

(Box was about 30lbs) Instructions were short and simple. I bought the blue color and it\u2019s a lovely pale blue that goes well with any light blue decor. The picture in the description is color accurate.As far is as space is concerned, the chair fits easily under my very small gaming desk. With the arms up it slides almost completely under and is easily tucked away.The chair is super comfy, my back and head easily line up well with the design of the back arch and head rest. My feet touch the ground, even at the full height of the chair and I\u2019m rather short so that is nice.The wheels swivel nicely with no issues, works well on carpet as well as hardwood. Chair spins extremely well, very minimal effort, and it stays in place without rolling away or spinning to the side either.The material could be a little bit softer, if I had one minor complaint that would be it. But it\u2019s easy to clean and is super breathable for the summer months so it\u2019s a fair trade off.For the price point you really can\u2019t beat it. I looked through about 20 chairs in my search and I\u2019m glad I settled on this one. Definitely recommend if you\u2019re looking for something basic but comfy that\u2019s not going to take up a ton of space in your room.",

I usually don't need the armrests, but the right one helps keep my mouse hand's heel off the table top for gaming if I angle the armrest up at an angle slightly.Overall, I like this chair very much and it's good buy.",

It was a good price, really easy to assemble, and got here quickly. The color looks exactly like the picture as well. I wish it reclined a little bit, but it does have a rocking feature which is nice. I like that you can adjust the position of the headrest and the lumbar support, and the arms move up which makes it easy to tuck all the way up to my desk. I do have a motorized standing desk, so I was able to move the desk to the right height of the chair, but the chair does have adjustable height as well. It is lightweight and overall I think it works well for my needs. I am a writer, so I sit at my desk several hours a day, and this will work for that. I am not sure how it would work for people who work from home or for heavier people, as the seat is on the firmer side.",

                "reviewText": "So glad that I decided to go with this chair after lots of research and reading Amazon reviews.Firstly, it arrived early (yay!) Right away I was impressed with the size and how solid it was. I am also really pleased with the blue/white color which is very pretty and matches my office color scheme. It was super easy to put together. I did it by myself on my lunch break and started using it right away.The chair is firm, supportive and comfortable. I sit for 9+ hrs a day and have way less back and hip pain now. The headrest is a nice addition I wasn't expecting to like so much. I also love that everything's adjustable and can recline/rock which is nice while taking a break from work!",

                "reviewText": "It's been a month since I've been using this chair and I think it's time to do a review.What I like:- a wide seat (in fact, there is a lot of space and you can even sit with your legs crossed)- the armrests are raised- you can adjust the height of the chair- you can adjust and fix the height of the headrest- a comfortable back (it is wide and the support for the lower back is very good and movable)- the material is strong (the plastic from which the chair is made looks really strong)- easy to assemble (it took me about 30 minutes to completely assemble it)- you can swing (but not fix in a lying position)Which I don't really like:- I think this is a relative disadvantage, but the seat cushion is made of mesh material, so the fabric is not too soft against the body (if, for example, you are wearing short shorts), I like softer materials, so I just laid a blanket on it, but it might be just for meOverall, a great chair for working from home, and sitting long hours!",
