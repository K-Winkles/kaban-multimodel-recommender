                "reviewText": "This is a very good quality, heavy duty, sturdy chair that was easy to assemble. It's very comfortable to sit in. The lumbar support and headrest are adjustable so you can make it fit your needs. Also, the back is adjustable so you can have it lean back and lock it into place to your comfort. The armrests adjust up/down and twist inward/outward to your preference. The seat also slides forward and backwards. Another nice feature is the footrest. It's pretty comfortable and it works. I wish I had this chair when my knee was swollen from arthritis. About the only thing I dislike about this chair is the height. The description states it raises up to 22.24\" but that's on the side of the seat which curves up. The center of the seat is actually only about 20.5\" in height. For me it's fine but I actually got this chair for my husband and it's a little short for him. He likes his chair taller for ease of getting in and out with bad knees and ankles. So I guess I got me a new chair..haha. I didn't subtract any stars because for most people it's a great height. This is really an awesome chair with many great features and a weight capacity of 440lbs. I'd definitely recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "The lumbar support in this chair has made a significant difference in terms of alleviating back pain during long work hours. The reclining feature is wonderful-- smooth and adds a practical touch, allowing for quick breaks without leaving my desk. Plus, the neck rest is a nice extra for the times when I need to lean back and try to get the tension out. The mesh material not only contributes to breathability but also gives the chair a modern look. I like not having to worry about the chair sticking to my legs like a vinyl or leather one does and also it won't rip like my old pleather chair did. Every single feature of the chair is adjustable, which is great since we're all different sizes. The adjustable headrest and armrests are surprisingly accommodating, catering to different sitting positions and reducing strain on my shoulders. If you're considering an upgrade, this chair is worth considering for its practical design and especially the comfort benefits. Would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "Assembly is straightforward (not necessarily quick, but all of the parts are solidly built and fit together well - it just takes time to get everything put together). It feels like a standard desk chair and has all of the adjustment features one would expect - I chose to leave the headrest off, as I'm only 5'2\" and it forces my head forward at a super uncomfortable angle. Adjusting the headrest height was impossible until I looked at the headrest piece and realized that the bar that feeds down into the corresponding slot on the chair had a ridge that was preventing it from moving past the very first setting. After some extensive chipping away with a flathead screwdriver and a hammer (and some further shaving with my utility knife) it eventually was able to move between the different height levels, only for me to realize none of them were comfortable for me. Ultimately it wasn't a dealbreaker for me since I didn't choose this chair for the headrest, so overall 5 stars.",

It is very ergonomic, like my feels like it is supporting you, vs other chairs that you more or less sink into.Honestly, I'd prefer if the base was metal instead of chrome, but it's not a big deal. It feels well made, I am optimistic that it will hold its form for quite a while. That's the main risk with mesh chairs is eventually stretching and sagging. But for now I am super happy with it. I'll update if anything changes",

                "reviewText": "Ergonomic Mesh Office Chair with Adjustable Headrest and 3D Armrests High Back Computer Executive Desk Chair Gaming Chair with Lumbar Support. This chair was surprisingly easy to assemble, good directions and extra parts are included. One of the nicest features of this chair is the sturdy steel metal base adding stability along with the smooth rolling casters. The arm height, seat height, seat depth and tilt are all adjustable and can also choose to use a rocking motion for the seat back. The chair is comfortable and supports your bak and good posture . Like the breathable mesh fabric and its sleek high end appearance. The only con I could find is that it has three fixed lockable tilt positions which was too much of a tilt for me while working so left upright and loose in rocking motion. I looked a long time at chairs and find this a very good value for the money and comfortable for a 6'4\" family member as well as a 5\"5\" person due to the adjustability. Recommend.",

We're both about 300lbs, and most of the chairs that we've gotten in the past that claimed to hold that size of person, while structurally could hold us, physically were too small, most of the times having armrests that pinch in on us. That is not the case with this chair, and we find it to be quite comfortable to sit in.Assembly was super easy, with good instructions and parts that fit perfectly when we put it together. Overall, I think it took us about 30 minutes to put together in the end.",

                "reviewText": "Being heavy, finding good chairs that are comfortable is always a challenge. I'm 5'9 and 320 pounds, and I love this chair. This chair is comfortable to sit on all day long for work. It has a ton of adjustability, that you don't find in other chairs of a similar style. Most notable is the fact that you can slide the seat from the back forwards and backwards which is awesome. Also, the armrests are easily adjustable up and down, forward and backward, and rotating inward and outward. Fantastic. I think it's missing two options though. The first is to move the arm rests out further One more inch of room would be ideal for me. The other would be the option to move the lumbar support up and down. It's molded into the back and not adjustable. It's position is fine for me unless I want to put a thick pillow down, then I sit too high for the back support to be in the perfect spot. Those are just nitpicks really. Overall, though, it's one of the best chairs I've owned, doubly so by it's price point.",
