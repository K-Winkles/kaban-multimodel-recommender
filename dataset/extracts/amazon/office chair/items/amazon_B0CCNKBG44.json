I bought this since I work from home and need to sit for hours everyday and I can definitely see myself sitting in this chair for long periods. The footrest is a great added bonus. The chair reclines pretty far and you can also lock it in a seated position. The armrests move with the chair if you recline or sit which I thought was pretty cool.The white looks great. The wheels and part of the armrest are black so it\u2019s a nice contrast. It looks and feels luxuriousI did notice two threads in the backrest that were coming loose but it\u2019s not a big deal. All in all this is a very sturdy chair. I\u2019m a big man, about 250 lbs and I am confident this will hold me no problem. Good lumbar support and overall very comfortable. My wife said she\u2019s jealous and she wants one now!",

Easy to build out of the box, even comes with a few extra bolts in case of a quality issue.I hope the back locking mechanism stays strong over the next few years. There\u2019s no spring or tensioner to adjust for the leaning back resistance. Instead it\u2019s a lock in place lever.I\u2019m 6\u20192\u201d and 230 lbs, I\u2019m happy with its dimensions. I wasn\u2019t expecting too much with the leg rest but it\u2019s actually pretty nice. A little narrow, but it turns the office chair into a kind of Lazy boy.All in all I give it a 8/10 rating. Would recommend. Decent chair for a decent price.",

It is a bit oversized which my boyfriend and I both like because we can share an office chair and both sit comfortably. It does recline with a foot rest that was more sturdy than I was expecting and tucks away nicely when not in use. I work from home and my boyfriend works in media, so we are often sitting down for long stretches of time. Other chairs have left me feeling sore but this one is semi-plush allowing for support during long stretches without deteriorating. I think it was on sale when I bought it but overall the price point is perfect for the quality you receive.",

HE LOVES IT! And the chair almost reclines flat, the leg rest is easy to use and perfectly positioned. I hit it outta the park this time. He says it is so comfortable and works so well.

                "reviewText": "I am super happy with this chair! I was looking for an executive style chair with a high back (I am 5 feet 7) and this is so comfy! It reclines back quite far and love the added touch of the foot rest. I have been using it for a month and a half now and it looks just like the day it was set up. Really easy install too. I need the extra back support so I added and back rest and it made a world of difference for me personally.",

                "reviewText": "I got this so I could sleep at my WFH desk and work on things late at night. The footrest is okay, but expect your legs to stretch a little if you use it for extended periods. The padding is more firm than I was expecting, but a pillow or two actually makes a world of difference. It can get really comfortable with some bed pillows where you need them.Other than that, this is pretty good! The recline feature works well, and the footrest keeps your feet up, though don't beat it up. If you're leaning back a lot, bring a pillow with you for better neck support. It looks great too. I was not expecting how much it would class-up my WFH office. Very nice. I'm not sure how long the pleather is going to last, but if I get a couple years out of it, it'll be money well-spent.",
