The narrow base means that if for example you drop something and lean over to pick it up while still seated in the chair, you are likely to have the chair turn over and end up on the floor. In my case the chair hasn\u2019t been used much but 2 people have now ended up on the floor. The chair is comfortable but you have to be very careful sitting in it.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Do you want a chair that every time you move gives an awful (can\u2019t call it a squeak) dying duck quack sound that\u2019ll disrupt your zoom meetings and have clients asking if you have a pet duck? Then this chair is it for you.Sure it was easy to put together. Instructions are clear and concise. My 5 year old nephew could \u201cbuild\u201d the chair.Notice the chair is a little unstable. Not like it\u2019s going to give with you sitting on it. Just didn\u2019t piece/fit well together the way should. So much so the right arm popped off the back rest. I was annoyed trying to work with a unstable armrest. And I thought how did I use the wrong screw. Upon inspection- I learned I didn\u2019t. Tried to reattach but to no avail, this arm wrestle was awarded to the \u201cDying Duck\u201d. The threading insert has \u201cstripped\u201d but not by me. In a space of about 1/4 of circumference, is as smooth as a refinished I-35 one day after construction is done, nothing grabs until it\u2019s pass the smooth space. Now I know stainless steel metal is soft and can strip easily. But this is a manufacturing defect. Sadly. \u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d, like a haircut from SuperCuts on the Thursday special at $5 a cut.Are you someone with extra padding on your bum and needing a cushioned seat isn\u2019t a comfort need- then this chair will exceed that. The seat is hard and the cushion/padding gives to much so mine as well sit on a hard back book.Not recommended to use for duck hunting (ducks are scared of the sound of other dying ducks), would not place in a library- unless you can sit super still and don\u2019t need to breathe, but would absolutely use as a children\u2019s desk chair- \u201ctell them kids don\u2019t leave their desk til their homework is done and if they do, you\u2019ll know by the ringing sound of this not melodious chair.\u201dNeed a sacrificial chair to pull off a prank, you\u2019ll definitely get your bang for your buck with this one.Now if I was smarter I would sent this chair back for a refund. But I missed the 30-day window. So now I am searching for a new silent fart catcher- that\u2019s exactly that- silent! Hope this helps!!",

It was super easy to put together and someone even melted in L & R so the arms go on the right sides. The fabric on the seat is drying / rough so make sure you have pants on. The backing is very supportive and comfy. The wheels work well on hardwood, almost too well because if you don't hold it when sitting down, it will run away. The only thing I would suggest is making the instructions clearer as to how you lock the chair to the base because it took a while of me pulling the chair right off when I tried to raise it before realizing that the final drawing which shows how not to tilt too far back also shows how to lock the chair to the base. I also had to fabreeze the seat as it smelt like sweet vinegar when first taking it out of the box.",

However, the construction is difficult, and the one that I got doesn't allow me to properly put one of the support wheels in. If these weren't issues, it would be 5 stars easy, but I have to bump it down to 4 due to these issues. The support wheel not being there isn't too bad if I keep the bad wheel to the front, and the installation was hard but only at one part for me; screwing the backrest and the seat together. I have a feeling the one I got was returned by someone that either had a faulty wheel slot, or damaged the slot. Still a great chair, but far from perfect.",
