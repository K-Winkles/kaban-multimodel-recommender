                "reviewText": "I got this because I do a lot of writing on my laptop, and I've really been needing a comfortable place to write. Sitting on the couch with the laptop on my lap or the coffee table is just stupid. So I got rid of the stupid couch and the stupid coffee table, and built a desk and bought this desk chair. So far, it's perfect for the purpose. It looks nice, the back support and overall comfort is really good. The leather feels like quality, and it looks good as well. It's not an Eames chair, but it probably works better than one for what I need.Not five stars because the casters are cheap. I already had a crappy desk chair I tried to make better with nice casters, so I just transferred those over. It would also be nice if the arms had more adjustment than just up or down. Different \"down\" positions would be nice, but for the price it's fine. The rocking function is good as well.I'm 6'2\", and generally have problems with chairs too low to the ground. This one has a very comfortable height. The back and arms and seat dimensions and all that are just right; after having a few cheap chairs, this is legitimately nice. The packaging was good too - not excessive, but enough. And the assembly was pretty straightforward. I found the instruction sheet when I was almost done, but it was no problem.",

The foam was so dense it was a little difficult to line the arms up with the seat and the back. Once the seat was attached you really have to push the back into aligning the holes, because the foam is so dense. You\u2019ll need to leave the screws loose until everything is attached . Then go back and tighten everything. I put it together myself, but would recommend a second person.",

The legs are metal, and the shape of them makes it inevitable that you're going to kick them while sitting with the back of your foot, and it hurts!The second, which is really a deal breaker for me, is the breathability. It's not there. This chair will make me sweat in a matter of minutes and there is no way to stop it. My fault for not thinking a fake leather chair would do that, but it's absolutely horrible. I need this chair for work which means sitting for 8-9 hours. Now I just spent a large amount on this chair and I'm likely going to need another because I just can't work while sitting in a puddle of sweat. If it wasn't so difficult to do so, I would have sent this chair back.",
