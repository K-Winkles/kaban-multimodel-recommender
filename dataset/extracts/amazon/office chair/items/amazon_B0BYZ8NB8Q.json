                "reviewText": "First off, I have had this chair for a couple of months and realized you have to pull the handle OUT while not sitting on it to get it to recline. This is my fault for not reading the directions as I should have. Now that I have that figured out and the tension adjusted it works wonderfully.As stated I am a touch over 300lb and 6-2 and the chair very comfortable. I can sit comfortably for a normal workday with no fatigue or strain. The ergonomics help a lot in this category.The instructions were great and it is nice to get some tools but as like many things that we have to put together I used my own tools.Only option that could have made this chair better is having the arm rest move up and down vertically. Being able to lift up the arm rest is functional enough for what I need.Great chair overall; price, easy to put together, comfortable, stable, I like the black on white color scheme (looks like vertebrae from the back).Only Con (i could probably resolve this) the headrest is easily movable. For most that could be ok but I have to readjust it if lounging back.Will buy another one to replace my child's gaming chair since those only last less than a year for the same price.",

My previous chair was a $200 one from a different brand on Amazon - it was too high up, the chair was not comfortable, and WAY harder to assemble. I have to say, this chair was MUCH easier to assemble, and to top it all off it looked better. I love this chair so far.BUT, I unfortunately do have a problem with this chair. When my feet are off the ground and I'm leaning back on the chair, it starts to turn to the right. I'm not sure why. I don't know how to fix it. Please let me know how to fix this.Otherwise, great chair, great price, and the color scheme is nice too.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this chair after using one chair that I bought from eBay. The old chair was leather based and it was very bad quality. I was bit skeptical when I ordered this chair but to my surprise it has been one of the best buys for me. The chair is easy to assemble and sturdy as well as it gives very good comfort to the back. The lower back support is good and you can sit for long hours on this. The loth based material is also comfortable and is of good quality. Arms get folded up/down so it's east to tuck the chair in the table when not needed. I was able to assemble it in 30 mins. Overall this chair is worth a buy and will surely recommend it.",

That's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5!Update: After about a month of use, the chair is still great minus the initial shipping damage, but the lumbar support is not adjustable and can be uncomfortable depending on your sitting position. I have instead unscrewed the support and moved it up to make it more comfortable, but it was definitely a hassle to try and remove it from its original position. If you find the support hits you in a weird spot, I would definitely recommend trying what I did!",
