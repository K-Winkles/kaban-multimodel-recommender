            "<Scientific Design>An ergonomically designed seat is a very effective way for sedentary individuals to combat fatigue. The backrest is scientifically designed based on the curvature of the human spine, providing more comfortable and powerful support, helping you balance the pressure on different parts of the body and alleviate fatigue.",
            "<Flexible and stable>The universal wheel at the bottom of the home office chair can provide you with 360 degree rotation, and the sole of your foot can easily change position with a slide. The sturdy pentagonal base provides all-round support without worrying about overturning. The height can also be freely adjusted according to your height.",
            "<Reclining chair function>The multifunctional backrest tilt design provides more possibilities for your work and life, and the backrest of this chair can be adjusted between 90 degrees and 135 degrees. Whether you want to change your posture or take a short rest, it can provide you with the most suitable inclination.",
            "<Active headrest and hidden foot rest>The headrest of the office chair head can be freely adjusted in height and inclination, fitting your neck curve to avoid tension and stiffness. There is a hidden retractable footrest under the seat, which can lift and relax your legs, promoting blood circulation in the legs.",
            "<Comfortable to touch>The office chair uses high-quality breathable mesh as the contact surface, which combines support and elasticity. Maintain air circulation between the body and the chair, making your body feel more comfortable. The cushion, pedals, and armrests are all made of resilient sponges, which do not collapse after prolonged sitting."

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Surprisingly sturdy",
                "reviewText": "I didn't know that you could tell how well a chair is made just from handling the unassembled parts until I unboxed this thing. The metal parts feel very strong, and even the plastic portions are chunky and don't feel like they will break easily. The only part that seemed mildly breakable was the round bit around the base where the legs go, but it was clearly designed to be more flexible in order to fit the legs past it, and is not a structural piece. Everything else just feels really quality. Way higher quality than expected for the price of the chair, and quite comfortable (at least, in my opinion).The arm rests don't adjust, so if that's something you want you will not get that out of this chair. However, everything else is quite adjustable and my last chair didn't have arm rests at all, so I have no complaints.I was uncertain at first about the casters because I thought they just rested in place and were not attached, but it turns out that you just have to press them in with a little bit of force to make sure they connect.The lumbar pillow has no way of attaching to the chair, so another thing you might not like if you care about that sort of thing. Personally I don't really understand that stuff much, so this also doesn't bother me. It also wouldn't really be hard to attach it with elastic or something if I really wanted to. The pillowcase also can zip off to be washed, so that's nice.As for the colour, it is not the same as either of the ones pictured, but is more of a teal colour instead of blue. Once again, though, I'm not upset about this as it is actually the colour I wanted and had been searching for in a chair. Would recommend they update their photos a bit for colour accuracy, however. (I tried to take a more accurate picture, but it kept turning out more blue than it is for me, too, so it might just be hard to photograph)I will update this review later down the road in regards to durability and longevity, but for now I am extremely pleased with this product. Top marks.",

                "reviewText": "A quite nice chair that was easy to put together. Good, strong bolts, with threadlocker so they'll stay in. Some had hex heads, so you can use your own tools. There are only three kinds, and they're well-labelled. The instructions were nice and clear (a rarity!), and it was easy to know what's what. Everything fit well, and can tighten comfortably, so it doesn't feel like they're too loose or damaging it.All in all, it took about 20 minutes to build while watching a show, so you could do it in 5-10 if you're actually paying attention.Comfort-wise, it's very good. The lumbar support is fairly forward, which might take some getting used to, but it's not unpleasant. There are some basic adjustment options, for tilt, and moving the headrest, which can be done while sitting forward and reaching back. The lowest height setting is a bit up there, so if you're shorter than about 5'6\" or so, you may not be flat-footed.",
