It has different speeds and strengths, but I am still in first gear.But every day I feel stronger, and that's half of the battle back to being strong and healthy again. How you feel, and this thing makes me feel, like I am going to do it.It not only helps your legs, but also works to strengthen your arms. It is a heavy machine, and you may need help getting it up on a table. But if you have someone that can do that for you, it works just as well for your arms, as it does for your legs.It was easy to put together. And easy to operate. It has changed my life, and it can change yours too.",

                "reviewText": "Operates smoothly (we did oil one of the pedals - it was kind of clicky). It's quiet. Tension seems to work well. I can definitely feel the difference in the tension from level1 to 4 to 8. The assembly is not difficult, but there are things that I had to ask my resident mechanical expert. For example, which way do the legs go a) smooth side up or b) smooth side down - answer a) smooth side up with recessed dimple side down so bolt head is in the hole and doesn't scratch the floor. Which side up on the pedals when you attach the straps. The front of the pedal has more curves, so attach straps with that edge away from you. Then when you hand pedal it's got places for each finger and is way more comfortable. Even though the small leg and where it attaches on the frame were both labeled front, the small leg goes closer to the person and the larger leg goes more toward the front. Must be a translation issue. Overall, I'm hopeful that this will be used by the elder who needs it. It looks like it will work nicely.",

                "reviewText": "I could not be happier with this piece of exercise equipment.Delivery: Packaged very well, all parts were there, in nice polished condition. Parts were solid, heavy metal. My wife put it together in about fifteen minutes with no issues. An extra bolt was included but not needed.Operation: Machine runs extremely smoothly with a very satisfying feeling - in other words, it feels good to pedal it. Almost no noise. The handle is a great idea, and makes it very easy to move the machine from one place to another.Storage: Machine is very compact, especially considering it can be used for both arms and legs (both of which exercise core muscles as well). A stationary bike, nordic track, rowing machine, etc. while giving the same benefits, would require a lot more space.Purpose: My wife's 71 y.o. knees are (literally) on their last legs - she's trying to stay in shape while staving off knee surgery as long as possible. She tried a treadmill and a rowing machine: both left her unable to walk after 10 minutes of walking/rowing. You should have seen the smile on her face after trying this pedal exerciser for the first time, using her arms! (I can do it! I can do it! She practically danced around the room.) After 10 minutes, she was glistening with sweat and breathing hard - so, obviously getting a workout.Thank you, Yosuda, for making a quality product at a good price!Regarding the pedal threads: Come on, people! Read the directions! The pedals are threaded differently, so they won't unscrew themselves in use. Any kid who has worked on a bike knows that. Yosuda went to a lot of trouble to try to make that clear, in the directions and by labelling the parts.",

It is heavy duty, and works really well, just isn't easily transported anywhere. The main problem is just trying to maneuver your body under the desk in a way that you won't hit your legs when pedaling. Once you figure out the position, it works well.",

Meaning that it is not directly connected to the crank. This gives a very natural feel to pedaling & makes exercising much more enjoyable. This unit, along with the others I tried, Have the crank directly connected to the flywheel so you can't stop pedaling without stopping the flywheel. My recumbent exercycle has the free spinning flywheel & I can stop pedaling & then start again & independent of the flywheel motion. It keeps spinning. I hope someday to find a small cycle machine that incorporates this feature.",
