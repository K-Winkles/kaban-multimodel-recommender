I love the headrest, armrests, and that this can recline and rock. Wheels roll well enough but could use an upgrade to smoother rolling rollerblade-type wheels. I'm also a big fan of the seat and lumbar cushioning. Very comfortable!My only issue is that two months in, the chair sometimes makes a loud noise as I reposition myself by pushing up on the armrests and sitting back down. When unmuted on calls, it's definitely something to be aware of.",

                "reviewText": "I chose this chair because my work chair's piston failed. After buying and assembling this chair, I found that replacement pistons were available on Amazon and will also be reviewing that process as well.Pro:Easy to assemble, metal components.Gray is neutral, but doesn't weight down the space visually like a black chair.Reasonably comfortable for long work sessions.Excellent for tall/large individuals (up to 275#, comfortable for user over 6' tall)Chair construction doesn't specifically list \"waterfall front\", but there is no pressure on the back of my legs.Cool mesh back and seat cushion cover.Excellent lumbar support and neck/headrest when leaning back. Watching video is a regular part of my work day, and this chair is more comfortable than my current sofa.Excellent valueCons:Doesn't roll well on my flooring (industrial low pile carpet.) This feature is also a pro when I'm viewing video! I can put my feet up on my footrest and not worry about rolling.Back doesn't support (or even touch) my back when seated normally for typing, but is great when slightly reclined for viewing video.Neck support is plastic on plastic \"slide and click\" that is difficult to adjust.Lumbar cannot be adjusted up or down. The height is comfortable for me, though.Armrests (and seat by thigh area) are slightly narrower than most basic chairs. The chair armrest puts pressure the outsides of my thighs and my elbows hang off the arm rests. Plenty of room for curvy hips and bum. My son (6/2\", 240) also found the thigh area/armrest width constricting, but my husband (5'10\", under 200#) was comfortable.Overall, this chair has several nice features for dual use as an office and gaming/movie chair. The size and weight limits are high enough to support larger individuals, although the thigh area may be a little snug for some. I use the chair in conjunction with a Blisstrends foam footrest and can stack multiple 90 minute work sessions in comfort.",

                "reviewText": "This is a decent basic office chair. It does have some nice features like a built-in headrest and a lumbar pillow. The headrest is adjustable up and down for several inches, but the lumbar pillow is built into the back cover and is not adjustable. I like how the base is more than just four spokes so it evenly distributes the weight of the chair and the occupant and doesn't leave marks on the floor. The adjustments to the chair are very basic (the headrest described earlier) and the height adjustment is all that you can adjust on the chair. There are no tilt or angle adjustments. The main cushion so far is very comfortable, surprisingly so for this basic of a chair. I'll be sure to update the review if there are any changes or breakdowns to the cushioning. It was easy enough to assemble, the instructions weren't perfectly clear but they were understandable. You get all the parts (all in good working order with no damage) and pieces (including some additional screws for the sections) needed to assemble the chair (and you should tuck away the Allen wrench (and the extra parts) that come with it as you will over time most likely need to tighten things up a bit (or replace a screw that's come loose and fallen out) to keep it in good working order. So far so good. As a basic office chair with a few additional features, I can recommend this product.Hey, just a footnote, in my review, I said there was no tilt on the chair. This is incorrect. The height adjustment handle actually moves in to lock the tilt, and out to release the tilt. With the tilt unlocked this chair is even more comfortable than I'd originally explained. This is a keeper, for the price you can't beat it. So let's move this from a recommend to a highly recommend. Thanks!",

                "reviewText": "This is the type of chair you should be using if you game a lot or work from home, etc.It's super comfy and has held up perfectly from daily use over the course of a couple of months. I work remotely and game a lot so I spend (no joke) sometimes 14 hours a day at my desk so comfort is of course super important to me.I love this thing, the back support is solid and cushy and feels great. And the neck support is adjustable which is great! I'm six feet tall so being able to raise the neck up to a comfortable height for me is unheard of when it comes to office chairs.I love this thing, sit in it for long work/play days and it still feels great to use.",
