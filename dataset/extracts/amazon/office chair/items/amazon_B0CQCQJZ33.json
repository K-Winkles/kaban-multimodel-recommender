The cushion on the chair feels like a cloud. The back support feels like your being supported but makes your back feel weightless I've never had a chair as unique feeling like this one. The arm support is adjustable and you can either raise them or lower them; which if your writing can make it easier to write without having anything in the way. I could also see this chair being good for gaming as its so comfortable. I recommend this chair if you need some back support without breaking the bank.",

I chose this one because it was very easy to put together (Hint watch the assembly instructions in the video in Amazon it helps for faster assembly)- The chair is very sturdy and adjusts to go up or down smoothly. I liked that it has two arm rests and you can tilt the arm rests up to push the chair under the desk when not in use. I highly recommend this chair.",

This thing is so comfy, with all its lumbar support, armrests, and even a headrest, I feel like I'm sitting on a throne. The mesh material is perfect for keeping my tush cool, and the tilt function? Let's just say I can finally reach my keyboard without straining my neck. And the swivel feature? It's like a party on wheels. I've used it in my home office and even in a conference room (just to show off). If you spend a lot of time at a desk, this chair is a must-have.",

This chair is very comfortable and was easy for my husband to assemble. Also, the tools that come with it are really good, not like some kits that have tiny little wrenches. Would highly recommend this chair.",

                "reviewText": "First off, assembly. Get someone to help hold the base still while you attach the arm rests. Otherwise you'll need a wall you can push it against. Everything you need is included so you'll be getting yet another hex wrench for your unintentional collection.Next up, comfort features. Not only is this height-adjustable and swivels, it has a tilt function so you can lean back if you want. The padded arm rests are covered in nicely stitched pleather. The head rest is adjustable but easier to work with if you're standing behind it.All the mesh is two layers. The back rest and head rest are more or less wrapped in mesh so there's a front and back layer. On the head rest the layers are barely separated giving your head strong support. Whereas the back rest has mesh on the front and back of the frame. So you're pushing the front mesh into the back mesh which lets it give a little so it isn't as stiff. Which is fantastic design imo.The lumbar support is soft and generous. It helps with posture and isn't intrusive at all. It's just extra padding on your lower back. It seems like you could remove it if you wanted to, there's a zipper on it. The seat cushion itself strikes a great balance between soft and firm. It has mesh covering it which makes it breathable and also lets you move around freely without being slippery.Lastly there's looks. Aesthetically this chair is very pleasing. What's great is that a lot of the good looks have a purpose. Like the pleather wrapping around the frame of the upper seat back. If there was mesh there it could wear out against the frame easily but having a stronger material makes it more durable plus gives it a more upscale look. The head rest adds to the looks because it says \"you can relax here\" unlike basic office chairs. Even the base that attaches to the wheels has a good contour and shape to the legs.This isn't a stuffy stiff work chair. This is a budget leisure chair that you can fall asleep in. Very supportive, very comfortable, I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered two office chairs online for my office and family room. Slightly different designs but similar chairs in build and quality. While this chair is not as comfortable as the other one it is also a fraction of the cost and does a good job for what it is.The armrests are not very well padded which I think is a huge drawback but it does include a comfortable headrest for neck support. I also think the lumbar portion could be better made. It does not extend far enough to really support your back and sometimes I find my back aches after using this chair for more than an hour.All that being said, it does look nice and the chair is at a reasonable price in comparison to others listed online. 4/5 stars would recommend with a couple comfort and support drawbacks as listed above.",
