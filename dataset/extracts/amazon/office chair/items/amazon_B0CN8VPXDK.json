                "reviewText": "Overall, this is a very nice chair. It appears to be very well made with quality materials. It comes in a box and requires some assembly. The instructions are fairly clear although there were a couple of steps that I had to read over a couple of times and consult a photo of the finished chair. But in the end, I found it not very difficult to assemble. It only took me a little over 40 minutes from box opening to completely assembled.What I like about the chair: I like the material and the leg rest extension. I have many conference calls every week and I like to put my feet up when talking and this is a great feature to help me with that. I also love how easy it is to access the rest and to put it back. It also has an adjustable head rest which allows me to move it upwards to the most comfortable position for relaxing. I haven't tried yet but I believe I could easily fall asleep in the chair. The base of the chair feels very sturdy. And it seems to roll easily enough.What I don't like: my last office chair had a backrest that was adjustable so that I could either lock it into place or relax it so that it was flexible where you could lean back and the spring tensions would offer some resistance. This char is not adjustable in the amount of tension. It will either lock into place (an adjustable setting for the length that you desire to lay back) or it is unlocked but the tension is almost non-existent. So when you lean back you have to do it slowly or you feel like you will fall backwards. So \"rocking\" is out of the question.OVerall I really like the chair. I would love it if I could rock but other than that it is really nice!",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased this office chair, and it has really changed my work experience. This design provides exceptional comfort while I\u2019m working at my desk. The adjustable seat level and padded armrest ensure proper posture that way it can reduce any strain on my back and shoulder as I am getting older. The quality is outstanding as it features smooth responsive mechanisms for height and tilt adjustment. The backrest is comfy for my shoulder. In addition, the seat cushion is both supportive and plush; thus, allowing me to be supported throughout my usage. One standout feature is the versatility of this chair. Whether I\u2019m using the computer or engaging on calls, it adapts to my needs. Especially with the pull out leg rest that I really enjoy. It\u2019s by far my favorite feature. The wheels also glide smoothly on my wood surface (even worked on my carpet) and the swivel function adds convenience.",

                "reviewText": "The Executive Leather Office Chair by BestGlory, is a great chair in so many ways, that provides comfort all day with an innovative and sometimes handy footrest. Here are some of the things I\u2019ve learned while owning it and a few things to consider before buying.I. Quality - The build quality feels very nice in most ways, but not excellent in a few. The PU leather surfaces look and feel like good quality. However, the legs and armrest frames being made out of plastic makes it feel a bit cheaper. I\u2019d still put the overall quality in the upper-middle level of the quality scale for office chairs and guess the longevity will be good.II. Performance \u2013 It offers a larger seating surface that\u2019ll accommodate most people. One of the most unique features about this chair is the fun to use and comfort providing tuck away footrest. It\u2019s nice to have for those rare times, I actually get to throw my feet up. The seat padding is also wonderful at 4.7 inches thick and a memory foam like feel, it gets appreciated as the day gets long. Every feature is easy to use and operates as designed. If you need your chairs to be really firm or you like those mesh chairs, this might not be for you.Overall, this is a solid choice by providing a durable/comfortable surface with adjustability and good value. It will support those potentially painful points and give you some control to dial it in to your specific needs. I\u2019ll be sure to update this review, if I ever start to have problems with it.You can trust that this review is simply my honest opinion that is attempting to provide you with helpful insight that I wish I had before I picked this product. Hopefully it was helpful in your decision.",

The shipping is as good as always, it arrived next day with well packages, which exceeded my expectation since this item is over 40 bounds. The chair took me about 40 minutes to assemble with its own tool. I like the parts package, each part has its own container and labels. So it's quite easy to follow the instruction. Also it's sweet to have spare parts.The material does not look like high end, but it's good enough at this price.The chair itself is quite comfortable, no matter is sitting or laying down with foot rest, which is the main different/benefit compared to what I had before. Also I noticed the chair wheel is smooth and quiet.If there is anything to improve, it will be the way to adjust the headrest. Current one is a bit hard to push the button and adjust the height of headrest.Overall, at this price, $199, I like this chair.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using the same chair in my home office for a few years now and it is starting to show its age. It was time to try something new, so I ordered this \"executive\" office chair.I am 6'1\" so I need a bigger chair in order to be comfy. I find this one to be mostly a good fit, but the pan/seat is just a bit short for my long thighs. Not by a lot, but it's not a perfect fit. A shorter person would not have this issue, but if you're taller than I am this chair might not work for you.The chair comes to you in more pieces than I'm used to. You really do have to put it completely together from the ground up. But assembly went very smoothly, following the included instructions (that are admittedly difficult to read because the print is so bloody small). All the fasteners use the same hex wrench, which is supplied. Things go much quicker and easier if you have the right size hex bit and a power screwdriver.The chair's faux-leather material is very good quality (I continue to be amazed at the quality of today's synthetic leathers). It is very soft and supple but feels like it is tough also. Time will tell how it holds up under everyday use.The chair has the usual adjustments for seat height and backrest angle. The arms are fixed and cannot be raised or lowered (although you could choose not to install them if you don't like armrests). The chair also has an adjustable \"headrest\". I use quotes because you would have to be very short indeed for this to be a headrest. What it actually does is adjust the upper part of the backrest up or down by a couple inches. Even at its highest setting, it only comes up to the top of my shoulders.There is an integrated footrest that slides underneath the bottom of the seat when not in use. There's no harm in it being there (it is completely out of the way) but I don't find it a very useful feature. First, it is way too short for my long legs to use effectively. Second, it does not feel like it can withstand much weight at all - the metal rods supporting it have quite a lot of bend to them. I consider this to be more of a gimmick than a usable feature. But as I said, it tucks completely out of the way so no harm done.Finally, I have to mention the comfort of the seat. I don't know what it is, but this chair has the most comfortable seat I've ever sat in. (The product listing says they use a special foam and integrated springs in the chair's seat.) The backrest isn't at the most comfortable angle for me (I like to sit almost upright and this one leans back just a bit) but the seat is SO comfy.So the bottom line is: this is a very comfortable and quite good looking chair that, in my view, is definitely worth the current asking price of $249.99CAD.",
