                "reviewText": "I personally love this chair \u2013 so far at least! It was easy to put together, seems really sturdy (especially given the price), and is comfortable. I work from home so having a good chair to sit on for 7+ hours a day is very important. This chair lived up to that need and seems to be a really good purchase. I do love that the chair is firm, but not too hard and the back is mesh so you don\u2019t get too hot. It does also have a head rest, and leans back for added comfort. The arm rests to move so you can adjust as needed, and you can also higher or lower the chair. Overall, I would recommend this to someone looking for a good chair at a good price. If you are using it on carpet \u2013 I do recommend a mat as it is hard to move on carpet but you would have that with any chair.",

                "reviewText": "Actually very surprised by how high quality this chair is! I was in desperate need of a new office chair as my previous didn\u2019t provide sufficient back support. I work from home most days and my old chair was really started taking a toll on my back. I searched high and low for a solid office chair that wouldn\u2019t break the bank. I decided on this one based on all the great reviews and I\u2019m so glad I did! This chair is solid, breathable, provides wonderful lumbar support, and you can adjust many parts of the chair to meet your exact needs. Good posture is much easier to maintain in this chair! I put this together on my own, it took me around 20 minutes. Not tough at all, the directions were easy to understand. Very happy with this purchase!!!",

I wish the attaching the arms was by a single screw with a knob and easy to adjust but instead are 3 bolts on each side. the other issue i didnt realize the back doesnt move back or forth to adjust the length for your legs and make the seat a little deeper. Other than that no complaints and easy to put together.",

                "reviewText": "This chair is fantastic! Love the way it feels and the options you have for adjustment. Especially the tension knob. It works really well to tighten so you can just the right level of tension to you can lean back and the chair will hold you there and then come right back up when you back up straight. As soon as I put it together (which is so easy and only take 15 minutes) my wife came and tried it. 48 seconds later I am back on amazon buying the exact same chair for her now. The only thing I wish was that it came in a white or black/white option. *NOTE* when you get to the step to install the arms look on the bottom of the arm pieces between the screw holes and you will see the L and R so you dont put them on the wrong side and have to redo like did. Love it though, very happy with purchase, and will recommend to people for sure.",

                "reviewText": "I spent a great deal of time researching chairs that were affordable but would also deliver on the quality I was looking for, especially with regard to lumbar support, as I sit at my desk for long hours during the day and have recurring low back pain. I recently got this chair and feel an immediate relief with the support it delivers to to the lower back. Everyone's back is different, but this chair contours to my back nicely and I love that the lumbar support is adjustable. Some of the chairs I was looking at had fixed lumbar support, which was a no-go for me personally.Additionally, the chair has other nice customizable features. I am around six feet tall and was able to lift the headrest up to good point so when I lean back my head hits it squarely. The tilt and lock features work smooth and easily as does the arm-rest maneuverability. Assembly was also pretty easy and clearly delineated in the instructions.Overall I am quite pleased and find that this chair delivers substantially on what was advertised, especially given the price point.",

The chair is high-quality and doesn't feel cheap at all there is one part that covers the intersection of the legs that is just a piece of cheapish plastic but the rest of the chair is either some sort of metal or high-quality plastic. While building, I found that it came with one extra of each type of fastener just in case you lost one. Also when connecting the arms to the seat part of the chair it will be hard without setting the seat upside down in a way that the arms can hang down to screw them in, the same thing when connecting the back of the chair to the seat part. I luckily had a stool to rest the seat down on to be able to put it together.",
