                "reviewText": "This chair is so comfortable that I have just ordered my 3rd one. One in July. Another one in August. My 3rd one the 23rd of October.The variable height, the nicely padded arms and seat and back, the ergonomics, the swivel, and the fact that it doesn't have wheels have made this perfect for my dining room table and two locations at tables in my studio. Easy to assemble and is very well made. I got all the same style - green.I can no longer get up easily from chairs without arms. The arms on this chair are at the perfect height from the seat and very strong. The swivel is great to be able to rotate around to tables and yet is very stable when I evenly lift myself to stand or ease down to sit. Add in the padding and this is a winner for me.Such a relief to finally have chairs that fit my ample body and limited mobility.I have added these arm covers to protect the chair arms, I like the material, and to be able to wash them as needed. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072C6K8N3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1",

Most frustrating thing is this chair is extremely loud- it makes obnoxious creaking an popping sounds whenever you move about in the chair. (Note. I am well under the weight limit for this chair). If you\u2019re doing any kind of video conferencing, you might become self-conscious about the sounds, and force yourself not to move too much. That\u2019s what I find myself doing. The sounds are so loud you can hear them across the house. Otherwise a comfortable, nice looking chair that blends in with normal home furniture/decor.",
