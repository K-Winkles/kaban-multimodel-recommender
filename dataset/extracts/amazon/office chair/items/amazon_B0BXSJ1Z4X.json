Best part, the metal base is better than other chair so it supports heavy weight. I'm quite satisfied. The cushion is soft and comfortable to lean on. The chair rotates easily, I used it for work and playing games. I don't get lower back pain from sitting too long. I'm happy with it",

This chair is quite comfortable and actually helps a little with the pain in my lower back. It doesn\u2019t make it completely go away because I have terrible posture and will often game for hours and hours, but the chair has a stable foundation and enough support where I can sit more comfortably and in different positions for a longer period of time. It\u2019s still on the pricy side but I think it\u2019s worth it.",

                "reviewText": "Hello recliner shoppers,I just received the chair today and wanted to review first day thoughts.The packaging was perfect. The box was smaller than I expected but was so well packaged that there wasn't a scratch anywhere.The instructions were inadequate. The drawings included were too small, the text too minimal. The installation video was more helpful but still missed steps. The two parts where the foot rest connects were not shown on the video and barely mentioned in the instructions. And it felt like, since they weren't really mentioned, I wasn't going to have the proper amount of bolts. Turns out I did and everything got put together perfectly. But, not in twenty minutes or even close to that. I'm not a complete waste of space but it took me some time.That said, this chair is well built. The pieces that the wheels attach to are heavy duty metal. It's not easy for me to get up from chairs so I use the arm rests as support, and there's not a single wobble. A nice touch is all of the bolts use the same size allen wrench... included... and the company gave us a decent one with a handle.The chair is really good looking.This chair does not rock. Check model numbers because reviews are for more than one model, and some do rock, but not this one, which is really unfortunate because I wanted a chair that rocked.I'll update this after I've had a chance to sit on it for extended periods of time, to recline, and I'll even force myself to take naps so I can test how comfortable that is.",

                "reviewText": "This is not real leather, but has a nice feel to it. The chair is comfortable and for a quick 15 -25 min nap it is perfect. The foot rest is a bit challenging to pull out, but it holds up nicely. I would recommend it to family and friends. The levers adjust smoothly and quietly. It does a great job for the price point.",

                "reviewText": "Pros: -Very sturdy, and the bolt holes mostly lined up to thread in the fasteners. -All the pieces were there, and they placed spares in case one was lost - Decent ventilated leather for the priceCons: - The 5 cent manual was missing pages. In order to assemble the armrest, I had to review the assembly video and guess. Fortunately I am a DIY guy, and I was able to figure it out. - The reclining aspect on the backrest is junk. It went back, but would not go back up. I played with it for 20 minutes or so, before it gave a loud snap, and went back in place. - Footrest - This is why we bought the chair... to help reduce swelling in lower extremities. Flimsy at best, held in place by rubber O-rings, and supported by plastic only. This was pre-installed, but I suspect I will be having to design a new bracket shortly.Notes: The comfort side was from my sitting, and the chair was bought for my wife. The neck support on the headrest should be fine for someone 5'6-5'9\". I am taller than that... It would kill my upper back after a few hours.Conclusion: Pretty nice chair... overall good solid construction, with some significant flaws.",

                "reviewText": "Took about 30 minutes to put together. I am 5\u20194 and at it\u2019s lowest setting is to tall to comfortably sit in with feet on the floor. But the seat is perfect for my short self! I have an attached area so I can sit cross legged and this is wonderful for all the different ways to sit. I work from home and this chair is fantastic for that! The material is actually soft and smooth. For the price I\u2019d like to say the options for hight should have been better and the seat back should have an option to stop the tilt. I\u2019d think for anyone taller the actually shape of the seat would become obnoxious since it\u2019s actually very short. Very weird mix\u2026 and heavy! Goodness be prepared this thing has weight to it.",
