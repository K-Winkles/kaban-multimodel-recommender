The arms are too short, and the chair itself is hard. I would send this thing back in a heartbeat but stupid me already destroyed all the packaging. So I guess I'm stuck with it. I do not recommend this chair unless you need a hard chair to sit in.",

It feels a bit like a low rider to mimic bucket seating. Easy to assemble if you screw in place the arm rests onto the cushion for your tush first. Then, place it on the side to screw in place the backrest. Lastly, assemble the legs with the roller wheels and piston. Align to place the chair onto the piston while in an upright position. Place the screw covers to hide the screws for the arms for ascetics.",
