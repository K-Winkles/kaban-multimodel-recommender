Also, the instructions were unclear about which screws to use. In fact, I would say put together the back of the chair and arms before the base of the chair. Also, I ended up swapping out the provided screws with longer ones to increase the sturdiness of the chair, otherwise, the ones provided would just slip out. I struggle to remember why I even got this one over the other chairs available. Will eventually swap this out too.",

But honestly it doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s still good.There were a few things that gave it the vive of a cheaper chair like plastic build. But I\u2019m saying this for a $36 dollar chair. This is a great value for the price. It\u2019s great for kids! My daughter thanked me a lot!Thank you \ud83d\ude0a to the seller for providing a chair for a good value.",

                "reviewText": "I am on a very tight budget and I needed a chair for my tall teenage son as his had given out. This seemed to be a good option for the money but I did not read all of the reviews. When we got the chair the box had no markings on it as though it had been bought from a moving store not that it belong to a company. The chair could not be put together, the arms that were given didn't match the bottom of the chair and four adults made an attempt but determined that the screws sent were not for the chair, the holes did not line up, and it was defective. I then went to try and return the chair, only to be given a label that would not print as it was in asian text of a language I'm not familiar with. We also had to pay for shipping. Given this chair was 32 dollars after taxes, and oversees shipping would likely be more than the cost of the chair, I ate my losses. I just gave this company 32 dollars for nothing.",
