                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Very impressive office chair . . .",
                "reviewText": "This review will address packaging/shipping/delivery, parts, assembly, function & usage, and overall impressions.Packaging: Double-boxed (very sturdy manufacturer/CYKOV box fits snugly inside a heavy-duty Amazon box), both fully intact; no visible damage, watermarks, etc. No shipping or delivery issues.Parts: All parts are present, individually packaged and depicted in photos in an assembly instructions booklet. The welds on the steel base look good. White cotton gloves are included--a nice touch of class. Small parts (screws. bolts, washers, etc.) to include a 5mm T-handled Allen wrench, are vacuum sealed on a blister pack card.Now here's a very nice consideration on the part of the manufacturer, CYKOV; each of the fasteners (bolts, screws, etc,) includes an extra one in its respective blister pack--now that's proactive customer service, and very appreciated. I didn't lose any in the ensuing assembly process--but, I'll admit to having been there on occasion.Assembly: The assembly instructions booklet is very clear and overall very good. All parts are identified in photos. Following the step-by-step instructions w/photos is not the least bit challenging. You need no more tools or fasteners than what are provided. One thing I found that was not mentioned in the instruction booklet was that the right-side arm and bracket, each bagged separately, were each secured with yellow tape on their protective bags--no doubt to differentiate from the left-side arm and bracket which were secured with clear tape. Very thoughtful, that likely precludes a potential mix-up during assembly. Following the instructions, full assembly took me less than one hour (including a leisurely coffee break).Function & Usage: Seat padding is firm, but comfortable; padding on the arms is less firm, yet quite good. The overall range of motion is as expected; the 360* rotation and rocking (fore & aft) are smooth. Hydraulic elevation (up & down) is firm and consistent. The actuator arm can also move in/out to lock/unlock the hydraulic cylinder, and can even lock in a reclining position. Reclining resistance is, of course, adjustable. No matter the attitude of the position, the chair feels very stable. For routine office applications, this chair will meet all needs in a firm yet comfortable manner. The adjustable lumbar is wider and more supportive than I expected--very well done. Overall I find this chair quite comfortable, especially as it encourages good posture and thus tends to diminish stiffness and fatigue.On a personal note . . . For me, as a guitarist, the flip-up arms are a godsend. It's tough to maintain good posture during extended practice/playing sessions when the lower bout of your instrument is constantly bumping a fixed armrest. Now I don't have to give that perpetual annoyance a second thought. Yes, I am very pleased with this chair. If you are in need of such a versatile chair, this one will not disappoint.",

It\u2019s very comfortable and provides good lumbar support. Moreover the sitting pad is made of leather. It\u2019s fancy and easy clean-up. I can flip up the armrest so that it can save the space. Also it\u2019s sturdy and very easy to move around.I like this new chair!",

Start to finish it took me about 15 minutes to put together!Quality is great for this price range and i like that the chair has very good range to rise and drop. It feels sturdy and I expect it to last. I also personally enjoy that it doesn't have any extraneous unneeded adjustments that I never use and really only serve to potentially raise the price.In short, great chair, good price, easy assembly! Recommend!",

I do like the nice large, comfortable seat and the ventilated back rest. I also like the 5 wheel base. It is very heavy duty. I\u2019m not exactly sure, but it seems that the chair height goes a little higher than other chairs that I have used. I do like the extra height. The chair was well packaged and the hardware well organized. I also really like the t-handle wrench that is included. It made the assembly much easier. Over all, I like it!",

The seat pad is firm, but still soft enough that you can sit in it for hours without discomfort. The arm rests actually have decent padding too. If you're the kind of person who rest on their elbows, then this is the best budget chair for avoiding elbow fatigue.The chair is also very easy to put together. It comes with everything needed for assembly in the box. I was able to put the chair together solo in about 15 minutes with little effort. Definitely worth it!",
