It was easy to assemble, and all of the position combinations with the footrest (for sitting criss cross applesauce!!!), headrest, tilt, lift, AND lumbar support make it the perfect work chair.",

                "reviewText": "i was a little skeptical at first but decided to give this chair a try after seeing something similar to it in a tiktok video of a WFH setup. i needed a new computer chair and my previous one was good and all but not as ergonomic as i would\u2019ve liked. i\u2019ve been using this chair for a month and a half and so far so good. my favorite part about this chair is how wide the seat is, because my pup likes to lay and sleep in my lap while i\u2019m working. with my previous chair, it was kind of hard to have her in my lap and awkward\u2026 with this chair, it\u2019s a lot more comfortable for the both of us. :Pi like how this chair also comes with a mini pillow and a headrest. i never owned a chair with a separate headrest and i was afraid this would get in the way but it\u2019s very comfortable and i can adjust it to my liking if i don\u2019t want to deal with it. same with reclining it back and lowering/raising it - it\u2019s really easy to do. the footrest is a plus, but i don\u2019t use it all the time. i like how you can adjust it forward or back as much as you\u2019d like. i really only use it if my lap gets tired from my pup\u2026 loloverall 10/10 and i would definitely recommend this to anyone who\u2019s looking for a comfortable and aesthetic-looking WFH office chair!!!",

                "reviewText": "Wow! I am so impressed by the quality of this chair! I can't speak for longevity since I've only had it for a week, but very heavy duty and comfortable! I can confirm this is a chair for the bigger people out there! The highest height setting puts my feet in the air sitting all the way back and I'm a plus sized 5'8 woman. The white color makes the chair look sophisticated rather than the gaming chair look. It took me only 20 mins to assemble by myself, very straightforward instructions. I've tried 4 or 5 Amazon desk chairs throughout the years and this is BY FAR the best one I've tried in every category. Only downside to the white is I can tell sitting on it with dark denim or other dark clothing may rub off or stain the white chair fabric. It even mentions this on the paperwork that comes inside of the box. But part of this chair purchase was upgrading the esthetic of my old chair so I'll take the beautiful white any day!",

(I'm 5'7\" for reference) When I turn to watch TV I can recline back a little and fold out the foot rest to be in a more comfortable lounging position. The footrest also works as a convenient tray like surface for misc tasks or holding your dinner plate :D like I do sometimes.The chair itself is soft in cushioning but also firm enough to provide the back/hip support that many chairs do not offer. I sometimes sit for long periods of time and it provides maximum comfort during these periods. I no longer have to use additional back supports or cushions to add needed support.The chair arrived quickly after I ordered it, was very well packaged and completely free of any damage. It was also easy to assemble and I was able to do so fairly quickly on my own in minimal time.",

I had no issues with assembly other than the \"decorative\" piece on the back that covers the hardware doesnt snap in all the way. Not really a big deal. Its not a plush comfy chair, but it is spacious and I love the reclining aspect with the foot rest. It makes it so much easier for me to sit comfortably at the office. For that I give it 5 stars.The only con is it doesn't seem very durable. It seems kinda cheaply made. I'm slightly concerned about how long it will hold up, but for now it's great. Will update in a few months.",
