It is very comfortable and I especially like the adjustable lumbar support and the tilt back features. The casters work much better on the chair mat (over carpeted foor). I did have some difficulty initially adjusting the lever to activate the tilt back, but that could be due only to my getting to know the chair better. Overall I am very happy with this purchase. Good quality and competently priced.",

                "reviewText": "Just received and assembled.This was the easiest assembly I ever had for an office chair. I really liked that.It appears to be well made and sturdy.I didn't want to spend a lot of money because I've had $470 chairs go bad on me after two years. This is now my sixth office chair for my family of which two people use the chairs. If I get over two years out of this one I will consider it a win.The design is what I prefer because the arms attach toward the back which allows my legs to lay comfortably toward the sides and not be pinched.The seat cushion is very firm so it should hold up well over time. Because the seat sits back under the chair back it limits the depth of the seat so the seat doesn't extend out to where I am accustomed to on the other chairs I have had. It is still fine and I think I will get used to the new feel.On other chairs I have had the backs have split, the main post has broken off nearly sending me to the floor and the piston has lost it's lift ability.This chair has some heavy duty plastic that I don't think will split like the chair I had split because of a thin plastic area in the design. The chair tips back nicely but not super far which is what caused the post to bend and break on one of my chairs. Of the five previous chairs I've had only one lost it's piston pressure due to what was probably a bad seal. I had a two year warranty on one of my $470 dollar chairs and the warranty completely replaced the chair so the warranty was a good deal that time.The assembly of the seat to the arms is very tight so you will need a little muscle to push it into place so the screws line up. This was the most difficult part of the assembly. I would not recommend paying for assembly on this chair because of the simplicity of putting it together. If you don't feel comfortable doing the assembly yourself, have a handy neighbor assist and know that it will be a breeze for them.I am well pleased with this chair right now and hope it holds up well for the next two year or so.",

                "reviewText": "When I got this chair, I saw the typical parts list and nuts & bolts. I hate these products. I hate having to put things together because I always end up with additional parts from the toolkit. Well, to my surprise there were exactly the number of pieces identified on the list, that were needed to put the chair together. The additional parts I did find, were listed as such. Looking at the chair, upon assembly, its very skeletonized, so I was worried about support for my lower back. The chair has adjustments for that which actually work. The rollers are smooth and the piston doesn't wobble in the base of the chair or the wheelbase. All around, for the price this is a nice chair.",

However...Today, it got rather wobbly, and I noticed several chunks of a hard black plastic material on the floor beneath it. I am not thinking that this is going to last much longer. I have used this chair for 2 weeks only.Update 6/9 - Chair completely unusable. Support has not responded to either request for warranty assistance (suspense date 6/2), or for return assistance. I have since changed the rating to 1 star because I cannot change it to 0 stars.I have since replaced this chair with a completely different manufacturer/supplier. Since the seller won't respond, and I don't really see a way to have Amazon interface, it will collect dust in the basement until I find a way to strip it for parts, repair it myself, or just put it on the curb for trash collection.This is hard for me to say, because I usually try to stay positive and review products when they meet or exceed my expectations, but next time I consider buying an office chair from FelixKing, I'll just set $171.19 on fire and drop a brick on my toes. Perhaps that experience will help me remember how unpleasant this one has been.Update 8/7 - Nobody contacted me. Ever. I replaced this with a vastly superior chair from GT Racing, I invite you to consider doing the same! https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M6254X9?psc=1",

The seat and armrest material can be uncomfortable on sensitive skin if you are wearing shorts or lean in on the arm rest. It will leave a pattern. I placed a blanket down and it's not an issue at all. The back is breathable so no sweaty back when I choose to sit ergonomicly. It tilts back but not so much that you'll feel like you are falling back and it rolls decent on the carpet. I really like that the arm fold up so my chair fits all the way under my desk at the end of the day.",

If your wife is OCD on matching colour (black and white) like in my case, this chair would be perfect and for sure will get her approval!The seating area is black so it won't be easy to get dirty and trim is white so it matches my toys and my desk.There are few points I like about the chairs after a week of using it:1. The fabric is very breathable, definitely make it easy if you are working from home and seat on it for long time2. The arm rest can be flipped up. As seems in the pic, it allow me to sit closing to the desk and not blocking me at all.3. The adjustable height range is great. Anyone in my house has no issue sitting on it.With the price, the look, features and quality of the chair, I would definitely recommend this chair",

I like the colour (black), there is no difference but just my preference. It's very comfortable and it supports my back for long hours sitting. Overall, its a great office chair with a reasonable price. I would strongly recommend this product to anymore who works from home or who has problem with back.",
