                "reviewText": "I'm a gamer, but I bought this chair for my home office, not for gaming. (I have a sofa for that). My wife and I moved into a new home two years ago, and I intentionally went very cheap on office furniture at first because it wasn't a priority. For the past couple of years I had been using a $50 office chair that I picked up from Costco -- I think it may have been banned in Mexico which is why it was so cheap in the US. Small, rickety, and generally uncomfortable, but hey I could sit in it and work on my computer so whatever. Needless to say I regretted this decision when my company went to \"work from home\" this spring. Finally I decided to replace it with a legit chair. After a little research, I settled on the Dowinx and boy was this a good choice.Assembly was very easy and took me probably 30 minutes by myself. Ironically I assembled the chair while I was in a Zoom meeting with my camera turned off.The chair itself is pretty stable with just a slight wobble where the seat connects to the lift cannister, pretty much like every other office chair I've ever had. Otherwise everything about it is perfect. The back is nice and firm without being too firm. The headrest is there if I want it, but it's not intrusive. The seat is comfortable but not overly soft. Overall, I would describe the level of cushioning as minimalist, which is exactly what I prefer.For context, I am 6'2\" and 165 lbs. This chair fits me very well. The armrests are just the right width apart. The seat is slightly wider than what I need, but it's fine. The back feels like it fits my contours perfectly. In an ideal world, the leg-rest would be about 6-12 inches longer, but then it would probably have stability problems. As it is, the footrest is okay. I did not buy this chair to be a living room recliner, and the footrest is perfectly functional considering how you're likely to use this. I will add that the chair feels quite stable when I recline and stretch out with the foot-rest extended.The faux leather looks nice and sets this chair apart from other gaming chairs in the looks department. It's not going to look as sophisticated as a full grain leather executive chair, but it's gaming chair so why would you expect otherwise. What I appreciate is that the color I chose (grey) doesn't have anything loud or ostentatious. I feel like I'm getting the comfort of a racing-style chair while still maintaining a reasonably professional look.My only word of warning is that this chair is probably not a good choice if you are in the \"big and tall\" category. If I were any taller, the foot-rest would be useless. This chair can definitely handle people wider than me, but if you're worried about width then this is probably not the chair for you. Otherwise is it great.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: 21 June 2022: This is a follow up to my review below. The text below is still valid but the company reached out to me and made good on its promise of having satisfied customers. It took awhile. The company was going through a re-organization, factory wise and administratively. They apologized profusely concerning the chair and explained there (I didn't quite understand) either is now or will be a redesign of the chair. As far as comfort of the chair it was pretty good. If there is indeed a redesign and it takes care of the problems I had, then I would recommend the chair. I really liked the color - a dark maroon more than red. Also the chair was a good looking chair. As I indicated, it took awhile but if a company is going through a re-organization, I can understand why it took it took 6 months. If nothing else, their customer service is very good and responsive.I leaned over and not very far at that and over I went. I scraped my arm on a chrome wire kitchen cart I use for my copier and copy paper, etc and landed on my left wrist which hurts like crazy. I don't think it is broken or chipped because I can still move my fingers but it hurts when I try to touch my thumb to any one of my fingers and when I try to button a shirt there is a lot of pain. At least I landed on the seat back of the chair so did not hurt my back but scuffed up the back of the chair.I received the chair with the left hinge bent a bit. It looked like it came out of the factory that way because the box when delivered was pristine. The hinges are stamped out and in this case also left the edges fairly sharp so I filed the edges down before taking a chance of cutting a finger. The bent hinge was a real pain trying to get the seat back matching the seat bottom and and took me the better part of 4 hours trying to get that right so the back would fit correctly to the bottom.The legs are not long enough which makes the chair very top heavy. I am 6' tall and weigh 210 - not extremely big but not petite by any means. The chair itself is ok for the price. I don't see it as a long lasting 10 year chair though like my last one which I picked up used even and which this chair is replacing. i wouldn't complain about the bent hinge if I hadn't leaned over and fell on my but - yes I know how to spell it.I cannot recommend this model chair because of the short legs and stability problem. The chair looks nice in pictures but again the legs are not long enough. The office chair I was replacing had the seat cushion finally squished down to nothing. I think that was some of my back problems but the legs were long and very very stable. One could lean over almost to the floor it seemed and never have to worry about tipping all the way over. This chair is also a little wobbly also but I think most office chairs are to a certain extent. I mean they have one 2-3\" center post holding up the seat cushion and the rest of the chair and that's all. Maybe if the center post attaching the chair to the legs was 6\" round they may not be wobbly but I have never seen any like that.My 17 year old daughter said, yes! papa get a gaming chair when I showed her the chair on Amazon because gamers sit in their chairs for hours. I have to say it fits me very well. The back bolster is too big as someone else commented on so took if back off so cannot review the bolster nor the vibrator part of it. As mentioned, I really like the color - it is a dark dark red. I think it is a handsome chair in that color.It was easy to assemble until I got to the bent left hinge. To make matters worse, the right hinge bolt holes were oblong so there was plenty of adjustment for attaching the back but the left hinge had one bolt hole oblong which allowed for adjustment on the seat bolt but the bolt going into the back was a completely round hole just big enough for the bolt so no adjustment at all - if it had been oblong with some adjustment capability it would have saved me a lot of time. I probably should have sent it back but I had it all laid out on my floor and half put together, then all put together but the back did not fit to the bottom. Who's going to take it completely apart, package it all back up and ship it back. Besides I figured I could get the hinge straightened out without too much trouble. Not.And YES it squeaks when you rock. Someone else mentioned that also. An office chair (gaming chair in this case) should not squeak at least not when it's new. The rocking part is good with plenty of rocking, in fact some people may not like the \"long\" reach but I like it alot - (as stated in Amazon's description, you can also lock the chair so it does not rock at all).It lays down completely flat. Its a bit of a problem getting back up but when you're laying straight out it feels like a zero gravity chair and is quite comfortable. It IS a bit to get back up though. it has an infinite number of seat back positions. The completely up position is good for desk work and probably some gaming but when the back is straight up it IS straight up.Am I a happy camper? No. Will I continue to use the chair? Probably. I can't afford another chair so I'll just be super careful.I rated it 2 stars for gaming again because of the stability problem from the too short legs. I am not a gamer but my daughter tells me they can get quite \"involved\" when gaming.I rated it 4 stars for support because the seat cushion part and the back I think are very supportive. The seat and back are NOT soft like some office chairs. I would rate this chair like German cars with their (generally speaking) very firm seats but which allows for driving miles and miles and not be sore where as most American cars have cushy soft seats that feel good at first but after a few of hours one wants to get out of them. That's the way this chair is, like the German car seats and I like the firmness because it offers more long term support, at least in my opinion. I know this has been lengthy but I hope it will help some people with their decision making.",

                "reviewText": "I was in the market for my first gaming chair, and this one came across my Amazon search. The reviews seemed mostly positive, with very few exceptions, so I rolled the dice. Normally I wouldn't buy something like a chair without being able to sit in it first, but I must say, I was not disappointed. The chair went together very easily, and feels very solid, while remaining very comfortable. I'm 5'11\" and about 205 lbs, and the chair fits me perfectly. I would not hesitate to give this chair five stars if not for one small issue. The foot rest came out of the box with two small rips in it and the lumbar supporthas a dent that wont seem to come out. They don't hamper the function, and are mostly aesthetic issues, but an issues nonetheless.Other than the rips and dent, awesome chair.UPDATE: I contacted customer support, they were quite prompt in responding. They took down my order information and told me they would replace the damaged parts. I received the replacement parts today, and a free girft of a 16GB flash drive.Thank you Dowinx!",
