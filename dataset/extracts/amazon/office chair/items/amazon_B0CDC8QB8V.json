They work so well I often have to go get my chair after I get up at work. These also add a bit of height if your chair won't stay as high as you need anymore which is less costly than a new chair.",

                "reviewText": "Nice set of replacement wheels for any type of rolling chair. They went easily into the gaming chair we use. The only reason that I'm giving them four stars instead of five is because they DO NOT WORK WELL on carpets. On the kitchen floor or any other hardwood/tile floor in the house, the chair moves with the slightest push and rolls for a long time. On the carpet, it's a struggle and the chair likes to tip instead of roll. So if you're looking for a lot smoother roll for your chair, and you don't have carpets - then you can't go wrong with these wheels.",
