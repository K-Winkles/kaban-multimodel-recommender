                "reviewText": "Took off a star because the first one I tried to put together had an issue where one of the threaded inserts for attaching the armrests ended up coming loose from the plastic and turning, preventing me from tightening it and also preventing me from removing the screw without damaging it.The second one assembled a little easier, but it's still a pain to get the arms on. The tracks for the washers aren't large enough and causes them to tilt which makes inserting the screws difficult.I also had some trouble inserting the casters. Not all of them went in all the way, and still remain further out even after sitting on the chair. Even standing right above the caster on the leg wouldn't cause them to budge.After finally getting it together I was pleasantly surprised with the comfort and adjustability.The armrests can angle in and out as well as slide forward and backward. They can also be raised and lowered. They can be raised quite a bit higher than a lot of other chairs I've used which is great, because I usually find them too low.The headrest can pivot up and down as well as slide up and down. I wish I could slide it back/forward, but it doesn't have this feature. I feel it is a little further back than I'd like.I don't think the seat depth is adjustable but it's perfect for me like it is.The mesh is nice and has a lot of airflow. I have two similar chairs I bought from more expensive name brands and I like this one a little better.",

The assembly process was a breeze, with clear instructions and all the necessary tools included. Once assembled, the chair proved to be exceptionally comfortable. The ergonomic design provides great lumbar support, and the added bonus of neck support is a game-changer for long workdays. I can now sit for hours without any discomfort, making this chair a fantastic addition to my workspace.",

Once it is together very excellent at this price point.",

I have been sitting on this chair for about a month now. I like it! I am sitting on it every day for at least 8 hours. It feels really good. The seat-cushion is what i looking for. It seems they made it with a new memory foam. I can tell the difference between this one VS my old one which use the ugly glue-mixed and used material.For the set-up process, I would like to give them a like as well. The Instuction is easy to follow, screws and bolts are precisely fit. I set it up by myself in about 30mis.",
