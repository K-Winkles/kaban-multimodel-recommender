                "reviewText": "I am very happy with this. I did a lot of research before purchasing and appreciated the comfort of a return option if it didn\u2019t fit, which happily was not necessary. As others have said, removing the old one was very difficult so follow the helpful removal tips others have suggested. After that, installation was easy. My chair hasn\u2019t slid down once in the 1-2 months since I\u2019ve been using it. Good product.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased the Subhtoh Chair Replacement cylinder on Amazon to repair a gaming chair that my husband uses as an all around chair at computer desk, work bench, and as a gaming chair. He likes to vary the heights of his chair for the different uses. The original cylinder would annoyingly and unexpectedly leak and lower the seat. The Subhtoh Replacement Cylinder solved this problem by being easy to adjust and it maintains the heights at which it is set. The cylinder was easy to replace and well worth the cost. Easily a five-star investment.",
