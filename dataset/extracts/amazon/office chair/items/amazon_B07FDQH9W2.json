This chair was his pick, and when I tried his, I was very happy - It even adjusted for my 5'2\" frame. This seller had a better price than the box store, and I love my new chair! I am sitting at a computer teaching from home, and this chair corrected sciatic irritation. I was pleased to see so few parts to assemble and the superior packaging. My only challenge was needing a second pair of hands due to the wonderful \"cush\" surrounding the bolt holes. I found no problem with the holes themselves.",

Assembly was a bit of a pain because it was difficult to get some of the bolts started, especially for the connection of the seat back to the chair arms. I had to use a lot of care not to strip any of the bolts because I couldn't see where/how exactly they were lining up with the pre-drilled holes. It just took a little longer than I thought it would. Chair comfort is just okay. Curiously, the chair is nicely cushioned everywhere except for where my butt settles. The design should have more padding there and it would be perfect. As is, four stars seems an accurate overall rating.",

This was after calling \"customer support\" and being told that we'd have to try to return it, but since we bought it from an amazon vendor, they were wanting us to pay for the return shipping, which we weren't willing to do. The chair makes tons of noises (squeaking whenever you move) and every third time or so that I go to sit in it, it lowers itself all the way down, so I have to readjust the height. Really a big waste of money.",

                "reviewText": "Poitives: Great value for the price. Comfortable office chair for 8+ hrs day. Sure, a $1k chair may be more satisfying, but for $130 I don't think it can be beat. Way more comfortable and ergonomic to me than gaming chairs.Good height adjust for most common 27-30\" desks. Chair is able to lean back slightly, which I love. 7 months from initial purchase, 40+ hours a week, it still functions and looks like new (including the \"leather\" covering).Cons: It can be a major pain to put together (arms especially) but is doable, even solo. I must have forgot that caveat as 7 months from initial purchase, I just recieved and built my second chair for a home office. Again, it's a pain, but you only build it once so I went for it. Chair can also get noisier as it breaks in (creaky), but again, price to performance I'm not going to complain.",
