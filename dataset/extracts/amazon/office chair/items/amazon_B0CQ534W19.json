                "reviewText": "The box arrives weighing between 60-70 pounds and is well packed. I highly recommend keeping the box intact for use during the assembly process. Assembling the back, seat, and arm rests using the box as an upright assembly table makes it a lot more manageable. The assembly itself takes about 15-30 minutes. There is a video on the website that is very handy. Also the user manual is very well written. All the tools and parts needed (along with some spares) are included and are well labeled.Once assembled, the chair looks really good. In my case, I am replacing a 40 year old leather executive high back chair where rolling the chair has been challenging and the adjustments are limited and not easily done. I like the styling on this chair and I don\u2019t miss the styling of the previous chair (the only thing it really had going for it). The adjustments are many and easy to operate. The seat is comfortable and the mesh keeps the chair cool and comfortable even with long sittings. The height, tilt, lumbar, arm rests, and head rests have multiple adjustment positions with most accessible while sitting on the chair. Again, the user manual and video on the site are excellent to demonstrate how to operate the many adjustments.I have carpeting in my study as well as an area rug. The chair would be just fine on its own if it was sitting just on carpet. But the large area rug creates a plushness that makes the rollers a little hard to move, so I am continuing to use a glass floor mat. And it rolls incredibly smoothly.I am thrilled with this chair. In my opinion it is an excellent value.",

The chair is an all-black design with attractive chromed legs and premium blade-style casters. The chair back uses a breathable fabric for comfort while the chair base has a super-thick foam padding great for long hours spent in the office.The included blade-style casters make this chair easy to move around. The chair has a chromed gas lift for height adjustment and the whole chair swivels easily and smoothly. Tilt can be locked/unlocked plus you can lock in a desired amount of tilt which makes this chair perfect for reclining. The back also includes built-in adjustable lumbar support. The headrest and armrests are highly adjustable too.This chair offers more than just comfort and functionality; its chrome accents make it an attractive addition to any workspace.Assembly using the provided instructions was straightforward and I appreciated that the armrests and chair base were pre-marked for proper orientation. A pair of gloves and a high-quality handled hex wrench were provided which really allowed me to tighten all the bolts. Plus each bolt was coated in thread lock for safety.I would highly recommend this chair for its quality, comfort and adjustability.",

The tools required were included and it even included gloves for assembly, not that I needed them.2. What strikes me most about the chair is its sturdiness, it is very sturdy.3. I am very impressed with all the adjustable features it has from the headrest, tension on the back, lumbar support, the recline and the swivel arms.4. The seat cushion is very comfortable. I enjoy sitting in this chair.5. The wheels on this chair are the best I have had on a chair. It moves effortlessly where my other chairs' wheels lock up if they are in the wrong direction or they just aren't as smooth.The one thing I might caution of is the initial height of this chair seems a bit taller than others potentially. This does not bother me because I am 6' but for shorter people, they may not find it as accommodating.",

                "reviewText": "Assembly was pretty easy, instructions were (as usual) just OK. There are some plastic sleeves over the spokes of the hub that are not mentioned anywhere, I think these should be left on to make the fit of the legs tighter. Note, you have to jam the legs on pretty hard over those sleeves to get the holes to line up, but that seems to work out well.The rest of the assembly went smoothly and was very quick. I opted to leave off the coat hanger, since this is for use in my home and will not be needing it.There are a lot of adjustment options, which is the main reason I bought it. The headrest is adjustable up-down and rotates for a good fit. The usual adjustments are there for rocking or not, height, and rocking tension. Finally, the armrests are adjustable in height as well as some in/out front/back adjustment. There is also an adjustable lumbar support which loosens/tightens with a knob.Overall, this is a very nice and good quality chair.",

I edit videos, if that tells you how much I'm at my desk.Chair comfort is super important to me, and making sure it's gentle on my back is even more important. This thing is great, you can adjust the arm rests on the fly without having to mess with anything, easy to lock the tilt and it's just so comfortable. Love it. Don't get gaming/race car chairs - get something like this. You don't have to be big and tall for it to be comfy long-term",

                "reviewText": "I'm lounging in this chair as I'm writing this review. It's a great buy. It has a high weight limit compared to other office-type chairs. The cushion is thick and supportive. The arm rests adjust in all different directions-not just up and down. The back reclines pretty far if you want it to. I like the headrest as well. The wheels roll a lot easier than the smaller caster-style that most chairs have. Everything is adjustable, but the chair fits my 5'10\" frame without much adjusting. I definitely recommend this for anyone wanting something more substantial than a standard cheapy mesh office chair.",
