                "reviewText": "Like the other reviews mentioned, the seat of my chair came a part after 3 weeks. The staples cut my leg up as it happened so quickly I didn\u2019t noticed it came part until I had several lacerations from the staples. I pulled what I could from the chair and used a blanket to fill in the gap but the chair is in even worse shape.The back is became loose like it\u2019s become detached from the base but there no way to tighten it or do anything.Even if these things didn\u2019t happen this chair is problematic- all the adjustments to the arms mean nothing when you can\u2019t adjust to what you want to keep it they way. They are so sensitive a toddler was able to accidentally adjust the arms with no effort. This makes it dangerous because you have no stability if you put a minuscule amount of pressure on the armrests and they readjust on you when you aren\u2019t trying to adjust them.The leaning back adjustment is worthless it\u2019s either locked to not move or unlocked with no wait to lock it in a different position. You can\u2019t use it without falling backwards because if flings you all the way back.I opened a case with the US consumer product safety commission due to the injuries caused by this product and seeing the same issues from other people. This product is not safe! I wish I could get my money back to buy another chair as I work from home and need an office chair.I hope this gets pulled from the shelves soon so no one else gets hurt.",

It was easy to put together. The mesh features are nice. Keeps me cool. I like the lumbar support as well as the headrest. Overall, this is a really good chair for my home office. That being said, there is an issue with the build quality of the seating surface. I saw another person having the same issue. The mesh seating surface on the right side of the chair is coming out. I have attempted to push it back inside the chair, but it keeps coming out, and only on the right side. Obviously, this happened 30 days after my return window closed. I will attempt to reach out to customer service to see what can be done. I have only had the chair since July of 2022. Very disappointed. I will update this review as needed.",

La calidad de los materiales es muy buena y resistente. Yo mido 1.63 y me queda super bien en su posici\u00f3n mas baja, tanto la silla en general como para la cabecera.A mi parecer los movimientos y las posiciones ajustables de los descansabrazos y cabecera son muy sensibles pero est\u00e1n ok.Llevo us\u00e1ndola 2-3 semanas pero espero subir update si algo sale mal.",
