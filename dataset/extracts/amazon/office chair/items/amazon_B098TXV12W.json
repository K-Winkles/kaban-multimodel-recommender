                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars surprising awesome.",
                "reviewText": "i doubt that cycling under my desk is going to result in my figure looking like it did when i was practicing muay thai 13 hours a week, or even when i was spending an hour and a half on an elliptical trainer each night, but what i can say is that it is AWESOME to know i'm burning at least a handful of calories extra each hour than i otherwise would.here's my quick and dirty review after two days of use:this product is, as everyone else says, shockingly well made. despite the hundreds of reviews indicating its high quality, heft, smooth rotation, and absolute silence, i was skeptical, and couldn't help but wonder if perhaps everyone just had lower expectations. well, i can vouch: it is high quality, heavy without being forbiddingly so, and rotation is absolutely smooth and there is no noise at all. i cannot tell you how many people have walked by my desk in the past two days who didn't even know i was cycling unless i pointed it out.so that right out of the gate: if you want to try an underdesk cycler, don't go cheap to save $50, and don't waste your money on the $300 versions. start here. even if it ends up not being for you, it WON'T be because it's cheap or squeaky or impossible to put together.which brings me to the next thing: it is, again, as others have mentioned, painless to put together. i did it in about ten minutes, and it only took that long because people kept stopping by my desk to ask me wtf i was doing.as for results, it's too early to tell, and again, i don't expect them to be shocking, but what i can say is that my thighs and even glutes are already noticeably firmer (not sure how my glutes are, since i'm just SITTING, but indeed they are). the most surprising benefit, though, is already tighter abs. when i woke up this morning, i expected my legs to be sore - they weren't. it was my CORE that ached, and it was a delicious sort of ache.this is because if used properly, you will be sitting on the edge of your chair, holding your stomach in, and relying on your core for balance as you pedal and type at the same time. which brings me to an important note: you definitely want to observe correct posture,, and NOT try to use this sitting back in your chair, because if you don't, your lower back will begin to ache in as little as five minutes.also, regarding those who have said they don't like peering under their desks to look at the display - i can't speak for older versions of the machine, but at least in the new ones, there's a long cord and stand so that you can put the adapter on your desk and monitor your progress.i will say that i'm a little flummoxed by reviews here and elsewhere that indicate averaging \"ten miles a day\", or even 40, because at least if mine is calibrated correctly, i did 97 my first day and 104 today. i hit 7 miles within the first ten minutes of my workday today. of course, i have resistance set at only 2, and am pedaling quite fast, and doing so *most* of my workday (290 minutes yesterday, 300 today), but i have a hard time believing i'm ACTUALLY pedaling at 23 to 25 mph, which is what the meter indicates. so i'm skeptical i've actually hit THAT distance.either way, this is probably the best $160 i've spent in awhile, and even if i don't end up looking like i spend three hours a day in the gym as a result (and i won't), it's awesome to not just be sitting and spreading ever wider the nine hours a day i'm behind my desk.also, as others have stated, my coworkers are fascinated. the skeptical ones: \"we'll see how long you stick with it,\" and \"there's no way that mileage is correct.\" the curious ones: \"that's so cool! if you start seeing results, i might get one too!\" the enthusiastic ones: \"let me try it! oh wow, this is awesome!! where did you get it? how much? can you send me the link?\"all in all, again, if you want to go an under-desk cycle route, don't even hesitate to go with this product.oh, by the way:regarding the calorie counter, don't get excited. i'd supposedly burned 2000 calories by noon yesterday. even the literature that comes with the cycle says \"don't trust the monitor, it's wrong.\" go to the website they give you and plug in your age, height, weight, resistance, distance, and time, and it will give you a theoretically more accurate calorie count. for a profound example, by the time i left the office today after 5 hours of cumulative peddling, i'd supposedly burned over 4000 calories. when i plugged my numbers into the site, it gave me a far more realistic read of 687. not as exciting as four grand, but still, 687 calories more than i'd have burned otherwise.in summary, you can't go wrong with this - though if you are tall or your desk is weirdly low, you'll have issues - but you would have issues with ANY of these products, in that case, and probably none that would be so smooth and silent and well-made. this is a shockingly high-quality product for the price, and honestly, i kind of can't believe how inexpensive it is relative to its worth.",

                "reviewText": "After reading reviews on several products I decided to spend the extra money on a stronger product. This machine comes with clear instructions and minimal assembly. It is a bit larger than I expected yet it is so durable. When using the pedaling machine it is very quiet and does not make noise. If used correctly it stays in place nicely. It comes with additional straps for extra stabilization which I do not use. Works best sitting in a firm chair (I use a straight back wooden desk chair). Super nice to exercise while on my computer or watching TV.",

This Deskcycle is very quiet, easy to assemble, tracks miles, time, rpm's, and calories. It slides easily under a chair when not in use. The feet are rubber so no scratching of hardwood floors. It is heavy enough that it does not slide around on the floor. I have recommended this cycle to my friend whose mother has Parkinson's so she can get more exercise. Perfect product!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this hoping to stick it under my desk and burn some calories while I was working. Unfortunately, it doesn't fit under my desk, so I had to put it next to my desk instead.For the most part, it's exactly what I thought it would be. It's very quiet and operates very smoothly. The range of motion is smaller than an adult-sized bike, and more like the range of motion you might expect on a children's bike. That's to be expected out of a device like this. It's easy to use while I'm working, and I can even work up a bit of a sweat without too much effort or extra noise. I've even used it while on the phone with customers, and they were completely unaware.What I'm a little disappointed in, was that I thought this would track the data in the app for me. It doesn't do that out-of-the-box. To connect this to your phone, you need to buy another accessory, and it's not clear to me what that accessory syncs with because it doesn't seem to be an OEM part.Also, it comes with a tether to tie it to your chair. Most office chairs have wheels, so it's hard to keep yourself from pushing away from your desk and to keep the deskcycle from inching away from you while you are pedaling. That tether is a pretty poorly executed idea when compared to the rest of the bike. it's just a long strap with velcro on it. I would have preferred something with some kind of clip-on connector that could more easily be disconnected without having to completely undo the entire tether. With this, you either have to fiddle with the velcro strap every time you want to use it or leave your chair permanently tethered to the cycle, making it hard to move your chair around.It also seems like the pedals are smaller than normal. It's been a while since I've pedaled a real bike, but the pedals on this seem more narrow than I remember, and my feet have a hard time staying in the center. It has stirrup straps, but if they're tightened down too much, it's difficult to slide my feet in and out of them. For the moment, those stirrups keep my feet on the pedal, but I can tell they're taking some strain. Because of how thin the whole mechanism is, my knees are further apart than the pedals and I'm having to pedal inwards rather than straight. This geometry ends up with the side of my foot being off the pedal. On a real bike, I think the pedals would be several inches further apart than they are on this.",

                "reviewText": "I chose the DeskCycle after reading a number reviews, it seemed to get the best rating. I looked at reviews on Amazon as well as on the Internet. The bike arrived as promised next day and was very easy to set up, there are really only four bolts and nuts. The cycle is sturdy has a low profile and is absolutely silent. The peddling motion is exceptionally smooth and the tension knob really works, increasing through 8 settings. The five function display is easy to use and can either sit on top of the cycle or, with the included extension cord and stand, sit on top of your desk. I also like that when you start topeddle, it automatically picks upfrom where you left off or you can reset it for a new workout. The bike comes with a handy velcro tether that allows you to tether the bike to your chair, although using it on either carpet or hardwood, had no issues when peddling correctly, as instructed in the manual. There\u2019s enough weight to the cycle that it doesn\u2019t easily slide away from you. I highly recommend this sturdy little cycle. I It fits easily under my 30\u201d desk and in the first week I\u2019ve peddled over 250 km.",

Whisper quiet, very smooth pedalling, and easy to get the km's in.Me being me, I jumped on and thought damn, this is hard. But when I had more time I realised I had it on the highest resistance. With the best resistance finally settled, I really got into using it. Only had it 3 days, but I can see it is perfect to use on the lower resistance while working without distraction as I get used to it, and when watching telly, upping the resistance for a good workout. My thigh muscles were in shock.I'm a 69 woman (a real one), work at a computer all day, and need to get the blood flow moving and the leg muscles strong. The 3D desk cycle(2) is perfect, and I'm confident it will become an everyday, a couple of times a day, workout that fits into my routine, that is, I don't have to make time for it.The construction is sturdy, and it's easy to carry around (would be for most people). Fits under the desk nicely, but too heavy for me to use my feet to push it around (okay, maybe I'm lazy and feet pushing isn't a valid criterion, but I need to get my seated position correct for the laptop and extra monitors, so for me feet pushing is something I do.I'm giving 5 stars, as it is value for money, does what it says, all the above, and will help keep this old body moving.",
