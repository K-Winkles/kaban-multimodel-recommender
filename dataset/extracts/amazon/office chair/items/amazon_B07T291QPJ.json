                "reviewText": "When Covid hit early 2020, I was sent home to work remotely for the first time in my working life. However, my old chair that is pictured on the right is about 25 years old and no longer has any butt cushion. It quickly became painful to work in that chair all day. I have since moved to a new state and found a remote job I will be starting soon so I decided it was time to upgrade the chair. This is a decent chair if you are on a budget like I am and you are not hard on your stuff adding premature wear and tear. For me, it has good lumbar support which I needed, and more cush for the tush! I am a proportionate 5'2\" female and about 125 to 130 pounds. The seat has just enough room for my butt but I don't think I would recommend this for larger people. I would look into sizing up to the big and tall chair. Take note of the seat and back size to know what would work best for you but this chair feels small yet good sized for me only because I was able to go by the measurements of my old chair. Might even be best for you to go into an office supply store to test out chair sizes for comfort before making a purchase. Sometimes I like to sit criss-cross applesauce and this chair has a very nice and smooth rocking motion after loosening the tight/loose knob for reclining and is so comfortable for me that I may fall asleep on the job and get fired. The back of the chair hits just above my neck so I am able to tilt my head back a bit to let it rest since my upper back and neck sometimes go numb after sitting for too long. Ugh, it's just so much fun getting older!!Assembling the chair was easy until I got to step 4 to put the back of the chair on. If you have another person to hold the chair back for you to align with the chair arm holes and screw in, then you should be OK, but since I had no one to help, I had to take the seat off and lay it down. I still struggled to align the back while the arms were attached to the seat so I removed the arms from the seat and attached them to the chair back and then aligned the seat with the arms and screwed them in. Once done, I inserted the completed assembled seat, chair back, and arm attachments back onto the wheels. The wheels glide very easily and will take you across the room after one push.I am writing this review the same day I got the chair so will update if I run into any issues. Otherwise, I recommend this chair.",

                "reviewText": "We purchased two of these chairs for a new office. They will be available to staff who have been assigned to standing desks. Since we have not yet hired staff, we are hoping they adapt to the healthier option of standing, but these are available. Assembly is really easy. They took me about 15 minutes each to assemble alone. If I had had help, it could have been done faster. Attaching the arms and back really needs an extra pair of hands. The weight rating is low enough that it may be a problem, depending on who is hired in the next few days. All that said, I find the chairs comfortable. The seat size is average, not oversized. The back provides plenty of support, and both are cushioned well for longer-term work. For someone who is larger, it may be uncomfortable; the chair is somewhat narrow and would be more comfortable for someone of smaller stature.",

The chair is very easy to assemble and seems strong and worthy of its 300lb rating. Over all comfort is good but, at 6'1\" 287lbs the chair is just too small and the back is too low for my taste.The chair is very attractive seems to be well made and the seat is comfortably padded, its just not big enough for me. My youngest son is the benefactor as I have passed the chair on to him and purchased myself a larger chair.",

                "reviewText": "Firstly, it's worth mentioning that without a second person to help squeeze the back and seat together during assembly, it would have been difficult to fully attach and tighten the arms to this chair. In my opinion it's definitely a two person job.But mainly, I will say that after having this chair for barely over a month, the seat is already quite flattened and as a result is not all that comfy. I'm well under 150 lbs so it's not like the cushion is under a higher amount of weight either. The middle of the chair, where the two main sections meet, is the worst area, and at this point it feels like there is basically no cushioning there at all. It looks like it will be plush but this is definitely low quality padding that will compress quickly. In fact my last cheap chair from Ikea lasted me well over 5 years before it got as uncomfortable as this one already is. The back feels supportive and I like the it's also got a fairly high back. If the chair will only get very occasional light use I'm sure it's good enough, but if you plan to sit in this daily I would not recommend.",

                "reviewText": "I had recently moved and had to leave my beat-up computer chair behind. I researched several different websites and the chairs that were offered but I finally decided on this Furmax Office Executive chair. I got the chair and it needed to be assembled, and I (a disabled female) did the assembly and just needed a little help holding parts together which I wasn't able to do by myself due to physical disabilities. I absolutely love this chair, no more pressure on the back of my thighs, the back is comfortable and I have even taken little cat naps in it because it is so firm but easy to relax in. We will be buying my husband one as soon as we move into our new home. You won't be disappointed buying this chair, I recommend it for anyone who has a physical problem sitting in hard chairs as I do. I was also amazed at the price, I worked in government offices for years, and similar (but not as good quality) cost the departments $300 to $400 each chair and this one was not near that price.",
