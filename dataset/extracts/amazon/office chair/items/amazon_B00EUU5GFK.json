I suffer from RSD (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy), and it is a degenerative, disabling disease that causes chronic pain in limbs; in my case, I suffer from nearly constant burning pain down my left leg, blow-torch burning. I\u2019d rather be water-boarded than spend an hour in an average high-school metal chair. Now that I have stated that, you know how important a good chair is for me. I happen to spend several hours a day at my home office, sitting for more than half the day working, playing, et cetera. In the beginning of my research, I debated between those high end Mesh chairs, high end Gamer chairs like DXRacer, and this Serta chair. I was really torn between the three. I was afraid the Mesh wouldn\u2019t be comfortable enough, and feared the DXRacer would be geared more toward young adult gamers than office workers (though I am a gamer as well). So, knowing Serta has a good reputation with their products being comfortable, I took a good look at this chair and purchased it after watching the Amazon Video on it. I took a gamble, telling myself I could always return it. My uncle helped me assemble the chair. It took us about 20 minutes tops, me being skilled at assembly and he a little less so, but I imagine most people can assemble this chair without issue and within reasonable time. The instructions were fine, but looking at the box\u2019s chair picture also helps. The Serta has all the stock, expected features and then some. It has height adjustment, with an above average max height. Me being six foot one, at full height extension, my lanky legs can\u2019t reach the ground, which speaks to its scope. There\u2019s only one other lever beneath the seat, so it\u2019s unlike many higher end chairs that have a gamut of confusing levers. The lever on the left side will lock and unlock the reclining feature. When unlocked the reclining extent goes pretty far back. Let\u2019s put it this way, I have yet to hit the max reclining position in a real life scenario. The last adjustable feature is the arm rest height. It works well, offering many different ranges of height. This feature in particular was one that I never knew I missed or needed. It helps improve ergonomics drastically. I tend to like the armrests high, subsequently my shoulders relax and experience less neck and shoulder pain at the end of the day. One downfall with the arm rests\u2014this is likely true for only my unit though I\u2019m not positive\u2014is that the right one wriggles and doesn\u2019t feel sturdy. It doesn\u2019t impact my everyday use, but when wiggling it, it moves loosely. The left suffers from no such defect. In terms of comfortability, long-term sitting, and overall feeling, it is by far the best office chair I\u2019ve sat in. In all my previous office chairs, of which I\u2019ve owned many (eight?), within a certain time frame, possibly minutes or hours, I\u2019d start to hurt. My chronic pain would flare up after hours of sitting or even just a few minutes. And my chronic pain wasn\u2019t the only thing that would bother me. Sometimes my back would ache, my knees would hurt, and my neck and shoulder area would become particularly obstinate. The Serta has terrific lumbar support. Instead of a flat back, a gaping hole where your back would naturally slouch, the Serta comes in to support. It curves naturally with my back and holds me up well despite bad scoliosis. It\u2019s not a full backed chair, for there is no head support, but I never found myself needing head support. I don\u2019t sit in my office chair to rest me head and, unless your job is extremely boring, I imagine you don\u2019t either. This is the first chair I\u2019ve sat in that contours to my entire back. It feels as though every nook and cranny is molded to it. The seat\u2019s width is nearly sized to my exact preference. If you\u2019re a little\u2026 bigger\u2026 on the backside, it may be too narrow. I can say myself, I very skinny and there is about an inch and a half left on either side of the seat. For this reason, it may not be suited for larger people. Speaking of butts, after prolonged periods of time, my butt never goes numb sitting on the Serta, which happens to be a first concerning my experience with chairs. Also, unlike those faux padded sub-$150 chairs, my weight never pushes me past the cushion on the chair\u2019s seat. I\u2019m light, but I do believe this is just superior craftsmanship and is the reason no butt-numbing ensues. On carpet the castors are extremely stubborn. The Serta is a hard chair to move when over carpet, especially when sitting in it simultaneously. The chair\u2019s biggest selling point is its biggest downfall. The Back-in-Motion pivot design simply doesn\u2019t work well. It can even be uncomfortable in some positions. I don\u2019t know if this is the case because I am a mere 140 pounds, but the back in motion technology fails to move with me when I lean forward. The only way I can get it to move with me is by kicking my legs out forcefully, and then it fights with me until it reverts back to its natural position. Also in my office it\u2019s difficult to kick my legs out\u2014not to mention awkward\u2014because my leg room is restricted by the computer and desk in front of me. I would have returned the chair for this sole reason if it wasn\u2019t perfect in nearly every other category. Having been a person with back problems, multiple surgeries, and chronic pain, I can overall strongly recommend this chair. If you\u2019re in a similar situation to mine, the Serta just may be the answer to your problems.",

                "reviewText": "Serta Ergonomic Executive Office Chair Motion Technology Adjustable Mid Back DesignI looked around for a very long time for just the right chair for my office at home. I finally settled on this chair. As with most reviews, there were some bad ones that caused me pause. For instance, one indicated that you could not adjust the lumbar pad because it was attached to the seat. I can see how that might be frustrating; however, it fits my back perfectly. It is so nice to lean back and have that support right where it matters. One review didn't like the seat movement/rocking. When I first sat down in it, I was a little concerned myself that I felt I was being pushed forward a bit, but I got used to it in about a day, and I love it. I like how the arms are adjustable up and down and that they are padded. I really have only one small concern with the arms and that is the structural material is a hard plastic. I have a habit of pushing myself up using the arms and then folding my legs under me on the seat. Because the arms are plastic, I worry that I may break them. So far they have stood up to my weight and I haven't had any problems. (I'm 5'7\" and about 168 lbs.) Finally, it was a breeze assembling. Overall, I am extremely happy with this chair and would definitely purchase it again.",

                "reviewText": "I am 26 and recently had surgery on my L4-L5 due to being hit by a drunk driver. I've been suffering for back pain for two years and was fortunate enough to have my work relocate me to work at home while I recover. My old chair wasn't anything special and I am a huge gamer and computer enthusiast so I spend long hours daily in behind a desk. My last chair wasn't anything special and was a chair I had for the better part of 8-9 years with no issues. It was purchased for about $80 in Office Max as a gift. After my accident I struggled to sit in that chair, especially after my surgery for anymore than 10-30 minutes depending on how much I had stretched and moved prior.I did weeks of research and came across this chair which seemed perfect as it was affordable and was meant for people with my kind of issues. The chair is definitely comfortable, but unfortunately it didn't take long before basic everyday use in an office environment (chair wasn't abused or used outside of guidelines stated by manufacturer) that it started having issues. My chair now has this slight tilt when any weight it put on it and requires you to shift your weight to the front right to correct align it again. It's very minor, but sitting everyday for sometimes hours on end, it's starting to really hurt my back.I examined with my best friend as the chair is still in pristine condition, to see the cause as we couldnt see physical damage. It seems the chair has a mechanism on the inside bay braces weight in a small metal ring (bearing of sort I guess?) and it appears on one side it snapped. I do not weigh over 250 lbs, and just don't understand the decision for this design or if I have a faulty product.I really like this chair and it's definitely comfortable, but now I'm afraid after 6 months of use I'm going to have to replace it and spends hundreds more. I just don't understand this design decision or why casual and light sitting (no jumping or heavy force) would snap such a vital part. I'm investingating warranty claims, but not having a chair for my back in the meanwhile will be hard to deal with when I need one to work. I may just have to bite the bullet and take my loss and look into other alternatives =(",

It was easy to assemble with instructions but may take some time depending on how handy you are. If the chair is placed on wood flooring will need a pad or a carpet for the wheels not to move.

It has a seat that functions in a way that I have never seen before; the part you sit on pivots freely, and it is connected to the lumbar support, so that when you lean forward at your desk it tips and the lumbar support tips with it, keeping pressure on your lower back. I don't know if this is for everyone, but I really like it. The rest of the chair is fully adjustable in the normal ways. I would recommend this product.",
