                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Less executive chair; more task chair",
                "reviewText": "THE GOOD: This chair came in a rather compact box opposed to how office chairs typically come packaged. The manufacture accomplished this by storing all of the chair's hardware in the back of the backrest. Unzip the backrest, remove the contents, and zip the backrest back up. Assembly was very easy; directions were very clear; and all the associated hardware conveniently sealed in its own blister on one single flat (see photo). The manufacture was also kind to include some extra screws.THE BAD: With packaging all of the parts and hardware kit in the backrest, there's not much room for padding, and this could be felt when leaning back in the chair - at least for me. The caster wheels are your standard plastic ones so I would recommend upgrading them to the rollerblade type. I have these on other office chairs and they are absolutely amazing. The tilt adjustment was lacking, in my opinion, as it wouldn't allow the front to tilt to accommodate those with shorter legs. The overall size of the chair is smaller than the American version of what an executive chair would look like. This chair is more reminiscent of a task chair.CONCLUSION: Overall, this quality of this chair would be considered average, however the aesthetic, design, and color is exceptional. I only wish the support and ergonomic of the chair were up to the same level as the design. Directions, assembly, and supply of parts were outstanding, and there were no surprises or issues when assembling the chair. Necessary tools were included.",

I have ordered several office chairs recently on an unwanted quest to find the \"perfect\" chair for me. My needs: nice appearance, easy rolling wheels, general comfortas well as lumbar support, flip up arm rests and quality.This chair meets most of my needs. Quality and construction are where this chair falls short.Two of the nuts simply wouldn't accept their bolts.With assistance, I was able to make the final product \"sturdy enough\" even though one bolt wouldn't go in without some shearing. In addition,the spring under the seat cushion is held onto the frame with Gorilla Tape as shown in pics 2 & 3! WHAT!?!Overall, this product is comfortable and looks great! However, I am understandably concerned about its durability and longevity.",

                "reviewText": "As a programmer who pretty much lives at my desk, I've got to tell you about this office chair I've recently started using. Honestly, it's been a fantastic find for me.The support this chair offers is spot-on for those of us who spend hours coding. It's got this lumbar support that really helps in keeping my posture right. I've been using it for a while now, and I've really noticed a difference in my back. Less stiffness, less discomfort \u2013 it's been a noticeable change for the better.I really appreciate how this chair fits into my workspace. The armrests adjust just right, which is super handy considering I'm switching between different tasks and positions throughout the day. It's all about those little things that make a long day of coding a bit more comfortable, right?Putting it together was surprisingly straightforward. I'm more into lines of code than instruction manuals, but this was hassle-free. Everything I needed was in the box, and I had it set up and ready to go pretty quickly. No fuss, no lost time \u2013 that's how I like it.Now, let's talk about comfort \u2013 because let's face it, that's key. The seat cushion is solid. It's thick, supportive, and feels like it's made to last. Sitting on it for hours doesn\u2019t feel like a chore, and that\u2019s a big plus for me.The design is another thing I dig. It's got this professional look that just fits right into my home office. And moving around is a breeze with the smooth wheels \u2013 I can zip from my desk to my printer and back without any trouble.So, wrapping this up, I'd say this chair has been a solid addition to my programming life. It's all about having that comfortable, supportive spot to tackle my projects, and this chair delivers. If you're coding for hours and need something reliable for your workspace, I'd definitely recommend giving this chair a shot. It's made my workdays noticeably better.",

Its very comfortable, what I like about it is that the cushion of the seat itself is very thick and supportive, it feels very high quality when you sit on it and is comfortable when sitting for long hours. The chair is very professional and simple in design and looks great in my home office. The armrests move up and down, so my arms aren't awkwardly pushed up too high or low. Overall, a great ergonomic chair for the price and it has improved my work experience. I would recommend.",

This chair has an adjustable headrest but you won\u2019t get the benefit of it if you are a short person. The chair has normal wheels and I wish it had bigger gliding wheels for better floor movement. The back mesh of the chair is strong, hard and comfy.
