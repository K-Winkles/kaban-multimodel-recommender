                "reviewText": "I really like this chair but it arrived in a box that was severely damaged. No parts were missing but it looked like the box had been crushed. There was one piece (see picture) that was damaged but the piece is so malleable that it wasn\u2019t an issue. It was also a cosmetic piece.Installation took around 45 minutes. The directions are relatively straightforward but there\u2019s a part where it doesn\u2019t differentiate between a left and right piece. However, the piece only goes in one way so if one piece doesn\u2019t work, just try the other.The other issue is putting the back plastic piece with the mesh backing. You need to use a lot of force to put them together. It\u2019s much harder than it should be.As for the chair, I love it a lot-it\u2019s comfortable ans it rolls around great. One improvement I would want is the ability to easily adjust the height of the arm rests. There\u2019s a button on the side to adjust them but because it\u2019s stiff, you need to use two hands to adjust it.Overall I recommend!",

I decided on this one and found that it was easy to assemble in just a few short minutes following the easy to read instructions. I like the easy to adjust headrest and lumbar support. The chair pads is soft and I can sit for longer times without becoming uncomfortable. Adjustable arms rest really round out the ensemble. Out with the old chair and in with the new more comfortable chair.",

                "reviewText": "My son spends pretty much most of his life in his office chair (between studying and gaming) - it's important that he has a comfortable chair with decent back support - something that his previous chair didn't provide. This chair, once assembled, is a delight to sit in! It can be fully adjusted to provide a personalised level of seating support that is extremely comfortable. The seat can move forwards and backwards, whilst the armrests also move up/down. The chair can be lowered/highered and the lumbar support panel can be adjusted for the required level of support needed. Was it easy to assemble? It wasn't too bad, although there's quite a lot of parts so be prepared and some of the threads for the screws could be better, making assembly a little fiddly - some screws had trouble taking initially. It does come with everything needed though.Sadly we did find that there's one piece that covers the screws on the back of the chair that wouldn't fit - the shape of the piece wouldn't fit in the gap provided and we had to leave it off. Thankfully it doesn't affect the working of the chair however, and is purely cosmetic. It's a lovely chair with some great support features - my son loves it. He'll be able to study (and game) in comfort from now on.",

The headrest can be adjusted too.Easy to move around as the wheels are smooth to move. Overall material of the chair looks durable and sturdy.
