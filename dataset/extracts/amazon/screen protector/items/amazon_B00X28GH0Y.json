                "reviewText": "Five years ago, I upgraded to my second iPad ever owned. Having never needed a screen protector for the first one, I never thought I\u2019d ever need one at all. Fast forward to today, because my device wasn\u2019t well protected by the Speck folio case it was in, the screen became cracked from a two foot drop. Since the iPad is still working fine, but reaching its fifth year of use, spending $150 to have the screen professionally replaced didn\u2019t make sense nor was I going to jeopardize its integrity by attempting to replace the screen myself. This JETech screen protector became a viable alternative after reading about how to prevent the crack from further migration. Not only was the procedure successful, but the manufacturer makes it so that anybody can install it without a hitch. The kit came with everything that is necessary for a straight forward process from start to finish.",

                "reviewText": "I have installed many glass protectors on mobile phones and this JETech glass protector was by far the easiest to install. All the things you need to help align the protector, clean the iPad glass, and push out the bubbles are included in the package. I had no trouble lining up the protector on the iPad and installing it. The bubbles all pushed out after laying the protector down on the iPad and gently using the cardboard card to push out the large bubbles. It was easy and fast to install. I didn't have to spend any time removing tiny bubbles, which seem to be a problem I've had with every glass protector I've used for my phone. But, this JE Tech was easy and for a large, iPad surface, I was dreading the time it might take to work out all the tiny bubbles. There were no tiny bubbles.While I can't speak to durability because I've recently installed the glass protector, I have definitely noticed a great reduction in fingerprints and smudging on the glass protector vs what I've had on the iPad glass directly. I was spending a lot of time cleaning off my iPad and I wanted a glass protector to help with that. It also cuts down some of the glare, but not all of it, which is fine for me. I didn't buy it for anti-glare. It is more important to me to see clear and vibrant colors and sometimes anti-glare surfaces make the screen look fuzzy and the colors muted. So, this glass protector works well for what I want. The surface is as sensitive as the iPad directly and I feel confident that it will protect my iPad from scratches and any major damage, in case I accidentally drop it. I do have my iPad in a case, so that will also help prevent major issues, but this glass protector is the only thing saving my ipad if I drop it on the glass surface. I'd highly recommend it as of now!",

                "reviewText": "First, the packaging was great and very protective..of the protector, lol.Second, Love the screen protector itself, it\u2019s a good quality glass; and love the instruction guide for install. The instruction video is a nice touch as wellOk on to the nitty gritty.I wish I hadnt lost the hinge stickers! My table was cluttered and lost them in the clutter lol but I cut the \u201cdust absorber\u201d sticker into 3 strips and used 2 for the hinges. Still worked.I put an additional sticker of my own (a bandaid) in the center for added placement support.The alcohol wipe is a great size! I didn\u2019t realize how terrible a small square fragment-of-a-wipe is until I used this full size one.The \u201clift sticker\u201d is so weak that as I was lowering the protector it just went PLOP onto my iPad \ud83d\ude13twice I did this. Before concluding it wasn\u2019t me, it was the child strength lift sticker. Def should\u2019ve used a bandaid instead LOL. Why couldn\u2019t that integral sticker have been stickier?!At this point the dust absorber strip I had left came Way in handy for the little specks that had crept onto the screen while I was mangling the Book Fold application. I carefully lifted a corner and edge to insert the sticker and got \u2018em all.I definitely missing the scrape card for bubbles (unless it was still in the packaging?) but I really didn\u2019t need it with my careful finger coaxing. With some doing I got a beautiful finish.Great protector and I would recommend it and order it again.",
