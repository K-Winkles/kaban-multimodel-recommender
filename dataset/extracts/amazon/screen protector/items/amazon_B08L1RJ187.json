It is great at preventing reflections & glare, even in tough light conditions (e.g. using a laptop in the car with harsh sunlight). Installation was straightforward and took only a few minutes. The touch screen performance remains great. And visually, it is easy to forget the protector is installed. At less than $20 shipped for two protectors, it's a good value. Bonus...when shopping for a laptop in the future, no need to seek out or pay extra for an OEM anti-glare/anti-reflection screen because this add-on does its job well.",

Thing is, I like the way it fits the screen (mine is a 15.6'' laptop) and how good it does at eliminating the gloss of the display. I've even started to use the touch screen back again since I didn't like the fingerprints in the glossy display \ud83d\ude01.Though it has many perks, the only thing that is a bit difficult is installing the protection all over the screen. Even following the indications I came up with one or two spots of dirt (not your fault Antogoo). Hardest part to install are the corners where the stickers are (the ones which came pre-attached) so be aware of this.Anyways I fully recommend the product.",

My last straw was working in a coffeeshop with coworkers and having to tilt my screen super far back just to see what I was doing. Found this and immediately ordered. It's pretty darn great. -1 star because it's the exact size of the portion of the screen that lights up with no overhang. It's a little annoying because you have to get it bang on the line (side and top) for it to exactly match the screen. First world problems, I can now take my computer outside or work near a light source without being annoyed into oblivion!",

I can't wait to use it outside, which I don't do often, but it's so annoying with the reflection.It doesn't go edge to edge of the frame but covers where the display is located. The outside edge shows how much reflection is removed when using this screen protector.Thanks for a useful product. The screen should be non reflective from the factory.Used on a Acer Chromebook Spin 714 with 16:10 aspect.",

                "reviewText": "The directions on the back of the package are significantly different than the ones on the insert inside the package, and the \"parts\" supplied do not match up to either. Still, I cleaned the screen thoroughly with the provided materials - I'm guessing you're supposed to sort of \"drag\" the little tab-shaped adhesive bit across the screen in the final dust-removal process rather than repeatedly stick it down like you were removing tape residue. I hinged the protector with the two provided strips (took a while to figure out what they were talking about with that!) and then slowly applied the protector, pressing out air bubbles. And then (BE SURE TO LEAVE THE TOP SHEET PROTECTOR ON FOR THIS) attempted to squeegee out any remaining bubbles. And worked. And worked. And it's like they kept multiplying. I swear there are MORE bubbles now than there were when I first put the screen down.As a result, the screen is hugely distracting and when I finish this review, I'm yanking it off and throwing it away. Because in addition to being impossible to apply, I could detect NO difference in glare, especially when taking it outdoors in the shade. But just sitting on the counter, all it does is look dimmer. And bubbly. Did I mention the bubbles? Argh!!!!!",
