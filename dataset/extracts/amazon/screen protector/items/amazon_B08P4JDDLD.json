The protectors are great, the installation is a breeze, and the little screen protector applicator thing is fantastic. So quick and easy. I can't exactly speak on whether or not the protector have the same protection as a big name brand protectors, but I've has great success with these and the value is astronomical.

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Doesn't Work With Fingerprint Reader",
                "reviewText": "These screen protectors have a couple of things going for them: There are 3 sets in a pack; each set includes a protector for the front, but also a small protector for the camera lenses which is a nice touch (that many brands don't have); & they're fairly easy to install (altho had more bubbles to be worked out than with some screen protectors I've installed. But at least the bubbles could be gotten rid of.) But there are also 2 downsides: The film that has to be removed from the screen protector before installing has a tab that is VERY sticky, almost like it's been on there too long; the 1st screen protector broke when I was (carefully) trying to remove the film. Luckily, I had better luck with the 2nd one, altho the tab was still super sticky. Photos show how the 1st screen protector cracked, which made it unusable. The other, bigger issue, is that these screen protectors are thick enough that the fingerprint reader on my Galaxy S21 only works about 10% of the time, which is annoying enough that I finally just quit using that feature of the phone. I entered my fingerprints before installing the screen protector, & it worked flawlessly. Once I installed the screen protector, the fingerprint scanner no longer worked, so I deleted my fingerprints & re-entered them. Which was a chore, b/c it kept failing & telling me to press harder. I even increased the sensitivity of the touchscreen, which finally allowed me to enter one thumbprint; it never would register my index finger or my other thumb once the screen protector was installed. But even having done that, the fingerprint scanner just won't work. This phone also has facial recognition, and a pattern unlock option, both of which work fine w/ the screen protector. So if you don't need the fingerprint reader, you're good to go. But if you need that for any of your apps, think twice before getting this particular screen protector. The one on my last Galaxy phone never caused any issues with the fingerprint reader, so I know there are other options out there that will work.",

                "reviewText": "I took the advice from another reviewer and installed the screen protector with the case (an Otterbox Defender) already on the phone. While it means you can't use their install tool it didn't really matter, super easy to install, no bubbles, no issues, and it fits perfectly with the tiniest bit of space between the case and the screen protector so the case won't lift the glass protector off. This is true for both the front face and the rear camera protector. Everything arrived in excellent shape, all the glass screens were undamaged (no scratches, cracks, etc.) and I'm very pleased with the purchase. Fingerprint reader works fine for me, no issues, although that seems to be hit or miss per the reviews. Would definitely buy again.",

Finally, I rebooted the phone and registered them again with zero problems. I'm able to use it as if the protector wasn't on. No issues. If this changes I will update.* The on/off button is a virtual one near the settings icon. Pull down from top of screen to find.Update:::If your finger is dry it won't read it well. I usually touch a water bottle (condensation) and it works.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, thank you Tocol for being honest and forthcoming with what your product how your product performs. That's already an A+. After applying today, the same day I received it, everything about this screen protector is wonderful. The application process was surprisingly smooth, granted my wife did it for me She has experience in cellular sales and applying these protectors day in and day out. Also, it came with a plastic cover guide that fits over the front of your phone to help provide that extra centering of the protector as you apply it, never seen that included before. It feels nice and smooth, there are no smudges or much residue left behind from oily/sweaty finger touchs, and best of all: The Fingerprint Biometric WORKS! In fact, it even worked once without me re-registering my fingerprints. However, after starting from scratch, the fingerprint registering process was just as easy and seamless as if there were no protector on the screen at all. Be sure you do increase your touch sensitivity in your settings as I did. I truly hope everyone that tries this product has much success as I have. I travel for work every other week so it's nice to know there is finally a product that fulfills all my needs. I hope it works for all future customers also!",

Once the screen protector is on, you can't tell there's anything on there.I'm very happy with this purchase. :)",
