You don't lose any touch sensitivity or area, especially on the edges. I use this Thema watch face which has 4 custom touch areas for easy access to apps, and the screen protector does not interfere with it at all. In fact it actually enhances the touch area because you can get your finger tip even closer to the edge, since the bezel is tapered and the glass sits a little higher. Buy it, you won't regret it! I'm happy to pay a little extra for the simplicity of installation and the quality you get from Spigen!",

That precipitated a further purchase of a Spigen rubber surround, but that's a separate review.The quality of the kit is very good and the protector is virtually invisible, once installed. The video link is nearly useless. You just have to use the enclosed pictorial instructions and do the best you can. Once you do this the first time, you get really good at getting the protector on evenly.These are a bit expensive, but so is the watch.",

The first one did not stick and had large air bubbles tried to reuse but dust ended up after it falling out. The second one seemed to have stayed stuck onto the glass but had a very large air bubble that I had to use quite a bit of force to remove and to top it off it did not align in center even with the aligning tool, once side has a wider gap than the other. I would like to try again if Spigen will send me another box. It seemed that this one may have been old! I will update if I get a second chance.",
