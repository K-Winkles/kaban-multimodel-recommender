These screen protectors fit right over top of my monitors. I didn't want a sticky screen because the monitors are the property of my work and I may have to return them at some point. These blue light glare protectors are a little long, but they work great! The clarity is glass like and the blue light glare is dramatically reduced. My eyes thank you. I highly recommend these! I got three in total. Two for the big screens and one for my laptop. All of them are a tad long and a tiny bit short on the sides, but the quality is very impressive. It's like I got new monitors that don't hurt my eyes.",

For the one I have permanently turned to portrait mode (see photo) I used a couple of Velcro strips to keep the screen protector in place. They\u2019re a big help to my vision and really protect your eyes well but there is some glare. To get rid of the worse of it I partially covered the light over my desk with a piece of copier paper. I think the blue light protectors are a good buy for the price but be ready to deal with potential glare. They\u2019re a bit bigger than the screen but others I looked at were too small by a slight bit. Refer to the measurements table to see how the protectors would fit on your monitor.",

                "reviewText": "It arrived on time, and packaged great! It was in a box, packed firmly with styrofoam, and since both sides of the piece had a removable film on it, I knew it would not be scratched...I don't know why others are complaining of the shield being scratched, I wonder if they read the INSTRUCTIONS to peel the film off BOTH sides prior to installation?! Anyway, prior to using this shield, I bought a new monitor in May, and somehow after working on it for hours a day, I'd walk away from the computer and see a 'gray spot' in my right eye for hours afterwards...It only started after I received the new monitor....my old one I didnt have any problems with...well, I thought to myself 'I have got to get some kind of shield for my eyes', and after reading the reviews on this particular item, I decided to take the plunge $. It IS well worth it! No more Grey spot!! Eyes are no longer tired, nor do they grow blurry from using this! Reading is as crisp as ever...It adds a teensy bit of gray, but that is ok....its keeping my eyes healthy !! Get off the fence and take the plunge! You only have one set of eyes that cannot be replaced....do it for your health! xoxo",
