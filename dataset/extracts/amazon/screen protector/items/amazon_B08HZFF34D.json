Included are guidance stickers for placement, a dust collecting sticker, alcohol wipes, and a tiny microfiber cloth for cleaning. Also no bubbles underneath! These protectors have always kept my main screen safe from drops and scratches. My only issue is that for a majority of Motorola phones I've had over the years, the screen protector needs to be wider to perfectly cover the entire screen while still allowing for a case to be put over it. Regardless, I highly recommend these compared to other brands!",
