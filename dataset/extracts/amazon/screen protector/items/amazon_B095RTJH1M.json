                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Essential Defense for Your Device!",
                "reviewText": "Some background: I'm a System Administrator and a handy man for many of my family members.TL;DR: Out of ALL screen protectors that I have tried on Amazon, Spigen has yet to fail me.I purchased the Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector for girlfriends iPhone 13 Pro, and it has the same results each time I have used their product, exceeded my expecations. She always on the go, so I needed a reliable screen protector that could withstand the rigors of daily life (2 hours public commute, gym, lawn mowing, etc.) and this one has proven to be a true champion.Installation Made Effortless: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50The installation process was a breeze thanks to the included alignment guides and clear instructions. Within minutes, I had the screen protector perfectly aligned and securely adhered to her iPhone 13 Pro's screen. No annoying bubbles or misalignments to deal with - a hassle-free experience from start to finish.Rock-Solid Protection: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50She accidentally dropped her phone a few times since applying the Spigen protector, but to my amazement, her screen remained unscathed! This tempered glass screen protector offers top-notch protection against scratches and minor impacts, giving me peace of mind that her device is safe and sound.Note: It's not scratch proof. I have left my phone in a bag full of keys and screwdrivers and that is the only time it has been scratched.Crystal Clear and Responsive: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50The clarity of her screen has not been compromised in the slightest. The protector seamlessly integrates with her device's display. What's even better is that the touch sensitivity remains impeccable - no noticeable lag or difference in response time. It's like there's nothing between the screen and her fingertips.Fingerprint-Resistant Bonus: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50I can't stress enough how much I appreciate the coating on this screen protector. Fingerprint smudges used to drive me crazy, but with this protector, they're almost non-existent. A quick wipe and her screen looks brand new again. It's the small details that really make a difference.Perfect Fit with Cases: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50I was concerned that the screen protector might not play well with her favorite case, but my worries were unfounded. The Spigen protector is perfectly compatible with cases, and I've had no issues fitting her case over it. This attention to compatibility speaks volumes about the thoughtfulness of the design. She has a variety of cases from numerous sellers from name-brands to no-name-brands and they all fit without issue.In conclusion, the Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector is an absolute must-have for anyone who values their device's safety and performance. Its ease of installation, durability, and impressive display quality make it stand head and shoulders above other screen protectors I've tried. This product has earned my trust, along with my girlfriend's and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to fellow device users. Kudos to Spigen for delivering an outstanding screen protector!",

I found this and gave it a shot. It is so easy and fast. With zagg, I always had small bubbles no matter what I did. This one had 3 large bubbles right after applying. Then I used the included squeegee and all of them disappeared quickly. I haven\u2019t dropped my phone to see how sturdy it, is but it seems to be holding up fine.",

Most of the bubbles were gone before I pulled the film cover off. And removing the remaining bubbles with the squeegee was simple. One did require using the cloth instead, but still easy. When putting on most screen protectors, lining up the glass to the exact correct position is usually difficult. But the alignment tray that comes with the kit makes it almost foul-proof. Very happy with this product.",

                "reviewText": "This is the easiest to install screen protector you will find. I've tried many - Zagg, Otterbox, Belkin. This one installs air bubble-free every. single. time. All you have to do is follow the basic instructions.1. Turn off your phone (so you can see dirt more easily) then clean the screen with one of the provided wipes or some decent lens cleaner for glasses (this is better).2. Wipe the moisture from the cleaning wipe off with the cloth - which might (probably will) leave lint behind.3. Use the sticky to remove any dust, dander, hairs or lint. Be meticulous - it only takes about 15 seconds to do the entire screen.4. This is when you peel off the cover from the underside of the installation adapter. Doing it earlier can allow dust to settle on it before you can place it over the phone. The phone should be face up, the adapter goes over the top. It's a good fit and automatically has the screen protector in exactly the right place. It is impossible to get this wrong unless you put it on upside down (you won't - it says top with an arrow pointing to the top). When you've put it in place (you did remember to peel off the inside cover right? Otherwise you'll be cleaning and stickying again) in the middle of the install adapter there's a black strip that tells you to slide your finger up/down a few times - do this - hard. Wait 30 seconds. Remove that black strip then lift off the adapter. Peel off the last cover from your screen protector.Often there will be no bubbles after the install is done - but sometimes I found that a few (moisture bubbles) in random places under the screen protector. Use a cloth (not the stupidly hard slide they provide) to push these out to the edges, they are really easy to remove.That hard plastic slide they give you is apparently harder than screen protector glass and can scratch it if you're too enthusiastic. It's not the screen protector - I found it can scratch any protector from any manufacturer.No screen protector is perfect. All of them will scratch eventually (after all that's why you have it - so it gets scratched, not your phone). I've installed 10 of these for myself, family and friends. There is a reason these cost $15 not $25-$60. You get two kits, and you'll probably need both. Almost every time I installed these, one had a spec of dirt on the sticky side of the protector - before it got installed. Could it have gotten there because I was too slow installing it? Maybe. But it's too much of a coincidence. Happily it seems the second one is always clean. The thing is these protectors are the easiest to install - and if I follow those instructions above, at worst you might get a few moisture bubbles that are really easy to push out.",

En conclusi\u00f3n el cristal de Spigen vale cada peso que se pague por \u00e9l.",
