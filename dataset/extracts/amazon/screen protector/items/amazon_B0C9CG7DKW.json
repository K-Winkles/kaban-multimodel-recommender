                "reviewText": "i've tried multiple other screen protectors since i got this phone for my anniversary almost a year ago... i was (and still am) so paranoid of damaging my new phone. most of the other screen protectors i've gotten have been... bad. curved edges not staying down, fingerprint sensors not working, glass with glue only around the edges and dust gets under it... weirdly textured pve covers....this one is by far the best. it was extremely easy to put on. word of warning, the \"dust magnet sticker\" is WAAAAAY stickier than i'm used to. be careful when you get to that step. i wasn't expecting the level of sticky and i pulled my phone right out of the little mounting cradle frame thingie that's included in the kit. because if this i ended up getting a tiny bit of dust under the edge of the protector at the bottom of my phone. i thought i had screwed it because it was somewhat noticeable when i did it. but i chose to ignore it for the time being. unexpectedly, by the next day, my flub was nearly invisible. you can find it if you look for it, but it nearly vanished.anyway. it looks great, it feels GREAT... smooth like glass... not plasticky feeling at all. the fingerprint reader still worked even without needing to reprogram it, and installation was a breeze. i would recommend this protector to anyone, and will gladly buy again if i need to!",

                "reviewText": "Initial impressions:Likes:- You don't notice it is installed unless you are looking for it- Feels smooth like glass- Install tools made installation mostly painless (but not completely)- Fingerprint works but sometimes have to press a little harder than normalDon't like:- Had number of bubbles at the edges of the screen and no trick would push them out. Only way I as able to fix it was to use the harder plastic sheet from the cover to pry up the edge a bit to be able to use the tool to smooth it down without trapped air. The instructions need to be improved about how to deal with the bubbles instead of pretending that following the instructions will not result in any or that they can be worked out with the tool.- After 2 weeks my screen started to have bubbles along the edge of the screen but I was able to push them out and it has stayed adhered to my phone since.- My 10 month old likes to play with my phone and bite it and because of him biting it he has left some indentations on it from his teeth and I have put indents on it from my fingernails.Overall it is a good protector and will protect your phone screen from getting scratches but it is a plastic protector and will not keep your screen from breaking so just keep that in mind. I do recommend this one because out of all the plastic protectors I have bought this is the best one by far.",

I think this was the smoothest install I have ever had and not one air bubble. i have had multiple protectors on my s23 ultra and it has been hit of miss with the finger print reader working. Or the other thing is the protector does not work with the protective case. this product did bot so i think from here out i will be looking for majic john products first for my new phones.",

                "reviewText": "My goodness, it only took 20 years, but someone finally developed the ABSOLUTE BEST and easiest way to install a screen protector. I strongly advise anyone who purchases this to watch the recommended installation video 2 or three times (it's very short) so you can just kind of smoothly go throught the process. And smoothly is the keyword. This was so easy, and the results were so impressive. Even better this protector is so thin and flush with the screen that it doesn't even feel like there is one on. Great product! **Now make one of this privacy screen protectors with this easy to use method and I'm sure you'll have a number of sales**",

                "reviewText": "Not exactly as advertised. Kit comes with 2 screen protectors thankfully, cause I had to use both. I\u2019ve installed many iPhone screen protectors so I\u2019m not a novice. It\u2019s advertised as you can install it with dust on your screen and that when installing it will with little effort get the bubbles out from under the new protector. FALSE! I cleaned my phone screen Very well but when I installed the first protector, there was a huge bubble that would not go away no matter what I did. It seems like the new screen protector already had something under it when I installed it. So, I had to take it off and install the 2nd one. I will say that one went on a lot better but still had to work some bubbles out.The advertisement states this screen protector has security built in, it does NOT, if that is a concern to you. You can still read/see the screen when the phone is turned to the side.I will say the touchscreen does work well.",

Note to never touch side that goes into the screen or else you'll be needing a new one, just like what happened to me. With 2 attempts it was bubble free, the video guide was helpful. It looks clear, material a lot thicker than other TPU materials. Finger print scanner good, not super responsive due to thickness, need to go a bit slow. It picks up a lot of finger smudge. Fitting spot on my spigen case protector. Camera cut out noticeable when watching videos as it sits lower and wider from the front lens.",
