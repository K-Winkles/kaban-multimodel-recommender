Twice my fingernail has snagged the edge and it immediately was lifting because the adhesion is very poor.I will say thugg my fingerprint sensor is a little more picky but it still works fine and the screen protector will probably last at least a few weeks",

                "reviewText": "I did all the things with the fingerprint reader, but since they put adhesive under it, it doesn't work. When I went to settings to check my added fingerprints, 50% of the time it didn't recognize it at all, 25% of the time it did, and 25% of the time it said it was a different fingerprint. Why do they insist on messing with that single area??This morning, I dropped my phone approximately 3.5' to the ground and the thing just popped off entirely.The instructions are comically badly translated. I thought I was having a stroke or something!TLDR: find something better.",
