Sadly I've had it a week and broke it all ready but will be ordering another.i say it breaks on the edge easy because that's how my two have broken. I'm clumsy I drop my phone and it's fine until just a little rock or something hits the edge but hey better to spend 12 bucks then a thousand to protect your screen like this thing does and the color you will get many compliments on.",

                "reviewText": "after breaking the last privacy protector that I had, I was interested in finding something with a little more \u201cpop\u201d to it when I found this. can definitely say this hit the mark because every time I am at a meeting or out somewhere I get so many questions about my phoneobviously if someone is standing directly behind you they will still be able to see the screen but as far as being able to be out in public and not worry about someone looking over and seeing something they shouldn\u2019t (or preventing people from taking pictures of my phone)? you will be more than pleased with how this privacy protector does. I will give the warning that if you are wearing polarized sunglasses the screen will be near impossible to see, something to think aboutwill definitely be buying this product again, installation was a breeze thanks to the guide provided. it does tend to catch a lot of fingerprints because of the reflective screen but super easy to wipe away and make look new. the only reason that I knocked one star off this review is because it did seem to chip/crack fairly easily (needing to get a new one as I type this) but that is part of the deal with glass screen protectors. rather that than your screen",

As far as privacy goes if someone is sitting next to me I can tell what they are doing. Like if they\u2019re texting or what website they\u2019re on. Especially if your brightness is all the way up. You can\u2019t tell however what they\u2019re typing or read anything. When the screen is facing a certain way it sort of blurs the screen for others. It\u2019s not the best and it\u2019s not super private like a regular all black privacy screen but it\u2019s still pretty good",

I\u2019ve received a lot of compliments on it. The only thing is, is that it cracks easily. I drop my phone a lot, so Ive had to repurchase this 3 times in a short period. :/ Also, it sometimes makes my phone glitch with not being able to touch the screen when I\u2019m on a phone call. It\u2019s weird. It only happens when this screen is on.",
