                "reviewText": "First and foremost, if you haven't tried a matte screen protector, at this price there is no excuse not to experience how smooth, responsive and virtually smudge free this covering is.I really love this matte screen protector! It's extremely smooth to the touch, prevents glare, and does not show small scuffs or scratches like traditional screen protectors. I really appreciate the way the matte screen not only protects the phone, but really allows for the colors of the screen to be softened, not blaring and overly glossy.Maybe the best part is the cost \u2014 when i first purchased my iPhone 11 I purchased a brand-name Zagg screen protector and it was considerably more expensive. This screen protector is as good or BETTER than the Zagg protector (which is also no longer in production).My only problem is the glass appears a little delaminated on two very small areas at the very edge of the screen protector. This does not affect the function or the appearance of the screen protector at all as they are both on the very edges of the screen.Installation was effortless and it even installed without air bubbles. Most importantly, it's already saved me recently after one major drop.",

                "reviewText": "** Updated review! See below!***I am in LOVE with this screen protector.It went on super easy with zero bubbles, and the seams fully sealed.The anti glare is amazing. They accomplish this by ever so slightly frosting the glass. I love the matte look, and the feel of it is heavenly. Your fingers glide effortlessly across the screen. It is a VERY satisfying swiping experience.BUT, this comes at a tiny cost. As another reviewer stated, it does, ever so slightly, take away a little of the crispness of things. It is mostly noticeable in small text, if the phone is super close. But like I said, it is slight. If you have OCD, that may bother you. I have been using it for 2 full days, and it hasn\u2019t bothered me much. I watched an HD movie, and it looked great.It shows almost no fingerprints, only if your fingers are oily and the screen is off. The screen wipes perfectly clean in one swipe on my shirt. I am SO satisfied with the look and feel of this protector, that I will be keeping it, despite the SLIGHTLY diminished clarity. Give it a try, I think you will love it too!I hope this helps!***Update: changing from 4 to 5 stars. Been using this screen protector for 5 months now. See the pics where my phone has a black case on, those are pics from today. (The pic with the clear case was from week one.) Notice my screen protector is good as new. No scratches, no finger prints, no cracks. Still has the ever-so-satisfying smooth swiping experience. BEST SCREEN PROTECTOR EVER!!",

                "reviewText": "I have had 3 of these screen protectors in the past and they are hands down the best to use screen protector I have ever owned or used. I get compliments all the time on how smooth and cool feeling my screen is. It has a odd color to the screen that is hit or miss to people if they like it or not. The screen isn\u2019t the strongest screen protector I\u2019ve used as you would assume since I\u2019ve gone through 2 of them, but they are far cheaper than the more high end ones and they give a far better experience. The edges on the screen are so much nicer than any other screen protector I\u2019ve used since they are smooth and don\u2019t catch my fingers ever. This is amazing for all of the swiping gestures that the iPhone X series and above uses. One of the times I broke the screen protector was not do to it being weak, (I stepped on it hard while playing tennis) but the second lasted me almost 8 months and it Just had some wear and tear. I had 2-3 small chips and scratches but otherwise totally fine. The application is very easy and it goes on super well and quick. The box gives you plenty of tools however not amazing instructions. The box it comes in is neat and clean looking while not being too extravagant. The first two went on without any issues and zero bubbles. The one I have most recently put on had a bubble in the center but it was easy to safely lift off clean the dust and really thus removing the bubble. It also came with card to send another screen protector as a free gift to a friend with shipping paid also.My overall opinion is that is is an amazing user experience, it is more expensive than cheap screens but far cheaper than high end. It is great if you are willing to shell out the money to go through a few of them since they are relatively cheap but not amazingly durable.",

                "reviewText": "The screen protector is amazing. I believe this is a glass protector because it feels like it. It doesn\u2019t cause glare because it diffuses light but at the same time it feels incredibly nice on the fingertips. Very smooth and soft on the tips like I\u2019ve never felt before. It\u2019s also the first time I have put on a screen protector without leaving any bubbles! The package comes with the appropriate tools to apply the screen protector as close to perfect as possible. If my protector cracks, I will be coming back here to order another one!",
