I can tilt it ever so slightly and not see anything so the \u201cprivacy\u201d aspect is amazing! The fact that it comes with more than one screen protector is a big bonus especially for the price. 100% recommend!",

Kudos to Spigen cases for protecting the rest of the phone.I reached out to customer service after the second screen protector cracked. After a quick email exchange (check your junk mail folder), they sent me a new two-pack.Love the privacy for everyday activities when phone is upright, but screen is still viewable wide angle when rotated landscape - great when watching movies or trying to show the screen to someone else, just know there is no privacy from your neighbors. No issues with brightness or touch screen responsiveness.Kit is easy to use, guide ensures proper alignment and aids installation without bubbles! Highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "Removed phone from factory box. Immediately applied this product to screen on 3.2023. Hard shell case was applied exact same date/time.Screen was found shattered when withdrawn from pocket 11.2023.Never dropped, thrown. My physical activity was walking & sitting (not sports, physical labor, I did not fall on phone, etc); it was in my left front jeans pocket with nothing else. Just began using the phone after 6 months of it sitting on a shelf. Within 1 month experience the 1st shattered screen I've ever had in over 15 years of having a cell phone (a few years less for smart phones).No way to contact seller on product OR their personal seller page. Customer service solution is for me to drive several hours 1 way to return a $19.99 defective item that resulted in damage to over a $1,000.00 product when gas is $5.44/gal. so would cost me more (in gas $$$ & time) to find a car to borrow to do that (I'm a disabled person). I cannot afford that.As several other reviewers experienced (1 exact as I did: in their pocket), this product will not protect anything. So protect yourself: keep looking & purchase a different product to meet your needs, use the $$ to repair your screen/repurchase to be good to yourself &/or others as this product (&/or the advertising & name that tells consumers a lie, that this product provides unbreakable protection) when it does not.Have a wonderful day & I wish you joy (but if you jump, please remove phone from pocket if this product is on it - you won't be joyful once you land!).",

The reason I left three stars is because the privacy screen and ease of application is great. But I dropped my phone face down one time and my phone screen cracked and the protector screen did not. I feel that my screen would not have cracked if this hadn\u2019t been there to transfer the blow.",

                "reviewText": "2 Main points which I'm sure are the only reason anyone will read a review on a screen protector. So let's get straight into them. But if you don't want to read. Yes, I would recommend this screen protector.1) Does it provide the privacy claimed?While I wouldn't agree with the claimed 28 degree privacy shown it does make my iPhone 13 Pro screen almost black to anyone viewing at around the 40-45 degree viewing angle which is perfect for someone sitting beside you, but something peeping over your shoulder will likely still be able to see at 50-60% brightness.For me this is a fantastic amount of privacy as it's only to stop peepers on trains/planes and other public areas. If someone was over my shoulder in any of these scenarios I think there would be a bigger issue than screen viewing.2) Installation.They've absolutely nailed this, it comes with a plastic guide that clips to your phone like a phone case. Just ensure the screen is clean of any dust using the included wet wipes, linen cloth and dust stickers, then push the screen protector against the top of the guide and place it down.Mine lined up like a glove and leaves enough room to give a snug fit with my MOUS case. Thankfully I was able to avoid any dust underneath, but if you need to lift it to remove a piece they do include a few smaller dust stickers to assist with this.OVERALL:I would recommend this to anyone looking to get a nice bit of additional privacy, this screen protector will definitely give me some piece of mind when I need to email, check bank balance, or check my Apple keychain passwords while in public places.",
