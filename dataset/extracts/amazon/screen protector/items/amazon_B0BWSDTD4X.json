                "reviewText": "Original review: I applied the screen protector to my phone shortly after delivery. First piece of glass went on smoothly, but immediately I noticed a notch on the left side of the glass causing what looked to be a piece of dust refracting light around it. Upon further inspection, it was a slight, but enough, notch to cause the refracted light.No big deal. It's a 3 pack. I removed the glass, confirmed the notch, then put a second piece on, and lo and behold, the same thing. This time just further up the same side.It would appear the manufacturing process used here is causing this. Maybe these just slipped through quality control. Frustrated, I repacked the first piece, inspected the third confirming a slight notch on it as well, and left the second one on bc my phone should, for now, be protected. It's hardly an eye sore, but one nonetheless.I am strongly considering returning this product bc of this. I have always done well applying screen protectors to my phones and am 100% certain of the issue and it's origin here.Hoping to get a response and proper resolution from Supershieldz.**Please note that these are not chips or cracks in the protectors that I am referring to. These are normal cuts made when making each protector from a much bigger piece of material, in this case 9H tempered glass. This 3 pack, and I assume others, just didn't come out as smooth causing the refracted light on the left edge, possibly confirming the place where each cut was made. Typically, these cuts are rendered non-existent by the end of manufacturing. Not in this case.UPDATE: Customer service quickly responded and without hesitation sent me a replacement 3 pack and the pieces in that set were perfect. The one I applied fit perfectly and looked like it came on the phone to begin with. Happy customer all around!",

Shortly after purchasing my previous phone, I dropped it on a gravel road, it landed screen side down. The screen was shattered. I was sure that when I took the Supersheilz protector off, the phone's screen would have been cracked. I was VERY surprised and happy to see that the phone's screen was still intact. I doubt that the older flexible-style screen protectors would have done as good a job.Definitely a worthwhile investment for your new phone.",
