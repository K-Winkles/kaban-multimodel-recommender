Almost too slick, actually, since it actually inhibits my fingerprint security access, but that's OK since I was never too good at using it anyway. Easy to install, feels great to use.",

                "reviewText": "Went through many other screen protectors in the weeks following the S23 release.Some were bad, some fit poorly, none worked with the fingerprint sensor, most were more expensive.This one worked, fit perfectly, came with several paired wet&dry clothes which make a good apply-job idiot-proof for a guy like me, and three screen protectors.Fingerprint sensor worked great immediately and was even better after registering a \u201cnew\u201d finger.Happy buyer here.**Edit:** A few weeks later and my first big fall/drop happened. Phone had lots of momentum as I fumbled for it and was flung onto uneven rocky terrain. The screen protector was shattered, the back (which had another brand's case) was busted (even though it landed screen down) but the screen was 100% unharmed!! Extremely pleased and will be buying another.",

                "reviewText": "I upgraded to new phone and as always I look for a tempered glass protector. I cam across this product and saw good reviews so I decided to give it a shot. The installation kit is extremely helpful. Where I have an issue is after removing the film and rolling it out a few times, the bublbles on the top of the screen will no disappear no matter how many times you work it out with the squeegee. I ended up having to use both products because I had messed up the first one trying to pull it up to clear the bubbles out. Even with the second protector, the same bubbles on the top of the phone screen would not disappear. Unfortunately I have to give 3 out of 5 stars.. Now I need to find another set of protectors",
