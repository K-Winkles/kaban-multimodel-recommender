Breakthrough in Anti-Fingerprint Technology ClearPrint technology is a unique surface treatment\u2014used exclusively by InvisibleShield\u2014 that hides the visibility of fingerprints on your screen protector. Developed by NBD Nanotechnologies, this oleophilic process spreads oils from fingerprints so thinly on the surface that it allows light to pass through the oil, making fingerprints virtually invisible. Easy Application Glass Elite screen protection has EZ Apply tabs and comes with an installation tray to ensure accurate alignment. We\u2019ve also added a rubber install mat so you have a slip-proof surface to work on.

                "reviewText": "I have used ZAGG brand glass screen protectors on all my iPhones dating back to the iPhone 5 lol. An associate at an AT&T store turned me on to them years ago and I have used them ever since. These particular screen protectors are great because they really do protect your phone. In the event of an extra hard drop, the screen protector may break but your phone screen stays in tact 99% of the time. Which is good because I don\u2019t know about u, but I would prefer to spend $7-$20 to replace the screen protector rather than hundreds on a screen replacement or new phone. They really are durable, not the type to crack, scratch or break easily. When mine have broken, it has been due to real trauma to the phone, not your average everyday phone fumble. I also want to mention they are crystal clear quality glass so there\u2019s no obstruction to view or quality of image unless u don\u2019t clean the phone well enough b4 adhesion. Super easy to put on too, this ZAGG InvisibleShield Glass+ version has everything to clean the phone b4 application and a neat little tray to slide over the phone during application so u get the glass in exactly the right place every time. Easy peasy! I actually applied my last one kind of sloppily and there was an air bubble I wasn\u2019t happy with. First time I ever had that issue. I tried to smooth it out but that didn\u2019t work\u2026.HOWEVER, by the next day the air bubble had magically worked it\u2019s way out on its own! It was completely gone! So don\u2019t fret if a little air is caught between the glass and screen, it will go away with time.Long story short, this screen protector works and is well worth the price for the protection, quality and longevity you receive from it. I wouldn\u2019t buy any other brand. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve used this product for a few years, starting with my iPhone 5s. I drop my phone all the time, including on concrete, and it has always protected my screen. My last shield lasted me about 3 1/2 years until it cracked a bit on the bottom (due to all the phone dropping!) I did not replace, and my phone was still protected. Now that I have a new shield, my phone looks brand new again. I will always trust Zagg for my phone screen protection because it has never let me down. Installation is extremely simple - just ensure you have NO dust on the shield though or it will leave bubbles, but you can always take it off and try again.",

                "reviewText": "I didn't read a bunch of reviews before buying this protector. I've used Zagg products before and found them very good. I'll touch on my experiences of what others see as shortcomings.Installation: I removed my old protector which had become chipped around the edges and had a single crack across the face. None affected the use of the phone. Purely cosmetic.After using the cloth to clean the screen and the dust tape, I put the guide in place, removed the film from the protector and set it in place after which it began to adhere to the phone. After it was in place, I removed the guide and used the cloth to rub and assure it was in place. No matter how diligently I had cleaned it, there appeared to be two small bubbles near one another that no amount of work could cause to go away. Now, after several days, I see no bubbles anywhere.Fit: Yes, this screen protector does not cover the curved screen completely. It is slightly smaller than the one it replaces. Perhaps this will make it less liable to chip on the edges and still be the primary contact spot while protecting the curved edges if dropped. I think so.Reviews: Let's face it, some people will never be satisfied and anything that isn't exactly perfect, must be someone else's fault.I guy a couple screen protectors at a time. The others I have are Ailen which are curved. I'll try them next.I like Zagg and Tech Armor usually but I'll try other products just for fun. It's only a few bucks.I should point out that I buy soft, clear phone covers that are very sleek and not those bulky, hard to get out of a pocket models so I'm not bothered by how the screen protector and phone cover clash.UPDATE:I'd like to update my review. I've now had this protector on the phone for quite a while and I've dropped it a couple times with not so much as a scratch. The bevel of the screen protector makes it much less likely to crack or chip, unlike any of the ones I've previously used on this and other phones.Gonna stick with this product.That last one I had (Forget the brand) promised the moon but it began to chip on the edges fairly quickly. I don't drop the phone that much but perhaps the chipping was from contact with change or keys in the pocket in which I had it.",

The last time I dropped it, I actually cracked this screen cover, which surprised me - but better that than my phone screen.Installation is pretty easy, but this time the \"frame\" didn't sit on my phone very well; it was rather warped. That made it difficult to guesstimate placement.I know, I'm supposed to register it and get a free replacement - but I'd rather pay the price and keep my info to myself. No insult intended to the manufacturer; it's a very good product.",
