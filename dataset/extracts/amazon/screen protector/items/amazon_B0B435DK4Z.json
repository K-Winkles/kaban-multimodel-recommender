I still have a bubble at the corner of my phone, but that\u2019s as good as it gets. Once applied, it protects the phone well. Good touchscreen response.

This one is also otterbox so I trust it.Installation was super simple. You remove your old screen protector and the phone case, put your phone in the little square provided, clean it, dry it, remove the dust molecules, then remove the first tab on the protector and swing the arm over your phone and stick the tab at the top in place - perfect, it\u2019s centered automatically. Then you put your finger on one place where the arm isn\u2019t (don\u2019t worry there is a video and also instructions inside the box) and the protector adheres to your phone. Wait a beat for it to settle in, push any bubbles out (I had only one and it came out easily) and voila! Done.Easy peasy.",
