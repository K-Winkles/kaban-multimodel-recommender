                "reviewText": "So first thing you should know, with basically ANTI matte/anti-glare coating, you'll get some \"rainbowing\" on brighter, mostly white, backgrounds. If you're someone who uses the lighter theme on your phone or like your apps with a white background, you might not enjoy this.But for us darkmode users, you'll hardly see it. It adds some rainbow sparkle to the white areas. It's noticeable, but I've been using matte screens since 2010 or so on my desktops. Recently I decided to give it a shot on my iPhone. If you aren't used to the effect, you might not like it at first. Understandably, but once you're used to it, it likely won't bother you much.Firstly, I find the the matte protector offers much less eye strain on pro-longed use. While my wife's phone has a regular glossy screen protector on her phone (we have the same model), I will admit her screen seems a hair sharper and more vivid. But I wouldn't say the screen protector makes ours look blurry or unsharp by any means. Perhaps if anything, the light diffusion and ever-so-slight softening of the screen has made me able to use my phone for longer periods of time with less eye-fatigue than prior.Second, you can use it in very challenging lighting conditions easily. Unlike a desktop or laptop where usually you're using them in more lighting controlled environments, we use our phones EVERYWHERE. At all times of days. This means you never know when the sun light, or lighting conditions, will make it nearly impossible to use your phone without a massive glare. I can have direct sunlight on my screen and not need the brightness very high to be able to comfortably use it now.Finger prints are less noticeable with the screen on, and wipe away easy. Usually just gently rubbing my phone screen along my sleeve cleans it up. I use my phone a lot, perhaps a \"power user\" as some say. And I've not seen any issues in a few months of the screen film wearing at all, and I don't particularly baby it either.Overall there are a few small trade-offs as any matte screen film has. But, if you're used to it or know what you're getting into, and you take the time to get used to it, you might appreciate how much easier it is on the eyes or how much more useable your phone becomes in all conditions. I've even had people say \"oh wow, I like how your phone is matte!\" many times. I would recommend to anyone who is used to matte screens and wants that experience on their phone.Lastly, installation is as easy as any phone screen. If you do your due-diligence prior to installing with a good cleaning and patience, you'll get a flawless installation. My first screen protector lasted me from November to February before I dropped it and got a crack in it. The crack is perhaps a little less noticeable in a matte screen protector than in a glossy screen protector. I was a big drop, from around 5 feet high. The actually phone was perfect so the protector does it's job. I didn't have to swap out the protector, as it only had one crack in it, but chose to since I had a second one anyways. I've had this second protector on for around a month and a half now, and it's held up flawless just like the first did until a very large drop.",

There is always a \u201ccatch\u201d or some fine print that voids protection for the customer. My granddaughter dropped my phone on something, and of course, it landed face down, on a pebble, and the protector cracked. It DID save my phone from damage but I just figured I would have to buy a new one. While getting ready to submit my order, I read some of the other reviews on the page and people were having good things to say about replacement. Lond story short, I submitted my case and MOTHCA has agreed to replace not only my screen protector, but also my wife\u2019s which cracked several months previous to mine! I\u2019m quite surprised and also impressed! I will never buy screen protection from anyone else ~ iPhone or iPad! Thanks guys!",

                "reviewText": "This protector works extremely well with my iPhone. The protector is very responsive and works as good if not better than Apple's original glass. It does a decent job minimizing fingerprint smudges but it doesn't eliminate them. It's easy to install, stays in place, and prevents glare at any angle. I'm happy with my purchase so far and feel like it will hold up over time.",
