                "reviewText": "Wow what a difference between the cheap knock offs and this one. I've never used anything but the $6-$15 screen protectors before and they did ok I guess except my screen would end up cracked. I got the iPhone 13 pro a month or two ago End it as always put a $12 screen protector on it. Well dropped it couple times an it was cracked so I took it off and the screen was crack to the phone so it is still under warranty and as everybody knows that apples warranty means \"we will just give you a old refurbished phone for your brand new or only charge you 80% of what you paid for the phone (and that's with Apple care). So I broke down and convinced my wife to let me try one a little more expensive with a trusted name, as hesitant as she was she said ok and we reviewed many we ordered this to one and from the minute I opened the package it was great. They have a video with step by step instructions (I'm sure everyone does now) the alignment tabs are GREAT.??I normally go through three just putting it on without dust under it or bubbles then have To take it off three or four times then it won't stick so then I have to use another one. Cleaned the phone, dusted, followed the instructions and wow what a difference. It adhered on it own damn near and not one bubble. The clarity is damn near perfect , no smudging and it feels like it's part of the phone. Excellent Product Zagg. And I more than happy to pay for shipping for a free replacment if or when needed.",

                "reviewText": "Have had this for about a month and it is doing a good job of protecting my screen. One thing I particularly like about it is that is doesn't show smears on the screen from your fingers--not nearly as much as previous film screen protectors I've used. A minor complaint is that it does seem to collect lint, or fine particles of fabric, from being carried in a pocket and this is more noticeable than I've seen with other screen protectors.I did have one tiny trapped bubble, or dust speck, after applying the screen protector, which was annoying, but it was very small and in an area where it isn't very noticeable and I don't \"see\" it anymore. Didn't think it was worth trying to get a replacement from the company, but, due to the fairly high price tag for these protectors, maybe I should have!I would recommend these screen protectors, though would recommend getting them on sale. I also know someone whose phone was dropped when they fell down some stairs. The screen protector was cracked in multiple places but the screen on the phone was fine, so that is another big selling point for me.",

It seems to be more slippery or slicker than the IPhone's original screen, which I really like. The edges are polished so you can barely feel there is a screen protector on with the case installed. Easiest install yet - no bubbles!",

                "reviewText": "I am so mad about this screen protector. Before I installed it I watched the video twice, and I made sure to follow all the instructions exactly. I used the plastic installation kit and with using that, the placement of the protector ends up so that it covers half of the black box at the top of the screen where the camera is. I didn\u2019t think much about it though because it\u2019s made by Zagg, and surely they know what their doing. Their products are supposed to be superior to all other brands. Turns out that\u2019s a load of crap. I had family in town to see me because I\u2019m going through treatment for advanced stage 4 cancer, and last night I used the front facing camera to take a picture with my nieces. The picture was awful quality, it was blurry, and looked like we were in really poor lighting. We tried several different places but they all turned out the same. I\u2019ve only had the phone for 3 days so I was going to return it because I thought it was an iPhone issue. This afternoon it occurred to me that it might be because of the screen protector. I took it off and took a \u201cselfie\u201d and the picture turned out great. Too bad my nieces went back home early this morning and won\u2019t be back for another year. I will say that the feel of the screen protector was great, and I especially loved that it didn\u2019t show any finger prints or smudges. If you buy it, don\u2019t use the plastic thing that comes with it and make sure to install it so that it\u2019s low on the screen. As in, the very, VERY bottom of the screen. I\u2019m surprised such a well known company would let this pass as acceptable.",
