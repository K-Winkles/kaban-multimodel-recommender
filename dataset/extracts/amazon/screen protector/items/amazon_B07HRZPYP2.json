                "reviewText": "I used to have such anxiety putting a new protective screen on my iPhone. I would waste at least one screen from a two pack set because I could never seem to place the screen just right. I\u2019d make a mistake and the screen would be off-center and I\u2019d have to remove it and start over. When I would remove the screen dust would get underneath it on the sticky part making it unusable and I\u2019d have to start all over with another one.But no more anxiety for me because the tray in this kit makes it incredibly easy to put a protective screen on your phone. There\u2019s no way you can put the screen on wrong because the tray fits your phone perfectly and already has the screen attached to it. All you have to do (after cleaning your phone) is set your phone face down into the tray, flip the tray over, run your finger down the back of your phone, wait 30 seconds, lift your phone from the tray, peel off the sticker on the back and presto! A beautifully applied protective screen. I didn\u2019t even have to use the little squeegee they provide to smooth out air bubbles because there was only one tiny bubble that I smoothed out easily with my finger.This is by far the best protective screen set I\u2019ve ever bought. It made applying a protective screen so easy and so fast. The screen is very sensitive to touch too so you won\u2019t have any issues there. I highly recommend this product. Buy it! You won\u2019t be disappointed. Worth every penny.",

                "reviewText": "Update: Still works great! I\u2019ve dropped my phone a bunch since I\u2019m ridiculously clumsy, and it\u2019s still perfect. Hubby just got one for his phone too. :-)\u2014\u2014Starting off by saying this is not a paid or asked for review, no one contacted me, I just love it:It is still very early to write this review, and I will update if it changes, but so far I am extremely pleased with this screen protector. I\u2019ve tried many screen protectors across all my iPhones over the years, and this by far has been the EASIEST to apply. 100% easy, it fits so perfectly, I just absolutely adore the tray addition. It perfectly covers my screen and works with my otterbox case. It\u2019s idiot proof, and the squeegee they send to help with any possible bubbles is really high quality. I was replacing another company\u2019s supposedly \u201cglass\u201d screen protector because it was covered in small random scratches and wasn\u2019t responding well when I was texting. It left a weird residue on my phone that was hard to get off, and it was terrible! This screen protector is a world of difference!!! My screen feels so smooth and I\u2019m not having a single issue typing, whereas my old screen protector would often make me mistype words as it wasn\u2019t as good of a quality. This spigen screen protector says on the box that it is \u201coleophobic costed chemically treated glass\u201d, so maybe that\u2019s why it feels so much better. I really, really hope it actually protects my screen as it feels amazing, and at least right now is the best fitting, looking, and feeling screen protector I\u2019ve ever bought. Also the price is fantastic, you get two and I\u2019ve spent up to $50 on just one screen protector (that was supposedly amazing) in the past. This one feels and responds better. Fingers crossed it actually works!!!",

                "reviewText": "I used to pay Apple $50 to put a glass protector on. But when I bought this new iPhone 11 Pro Max they didn\u2019t have glass available. So I bought this. I was tentative it wouldn\u2019t be the same, poor quality or I\u2019d never be able to install it right. That said, there was nothing to worry about. The glass is clearly high quality when you first open the package. I followed the simple instruction, wiped the phone with a wet wipe, used an included sticker to pick up ANY and ALL dust and particles until my phone was perfectly clear (this is the hardest part, but it\u2019s still easy. Don\u2019t rush, any particles will ruin the install). Took about 2 minutes and then I laid the install frame, glass inside, (came shipped like this, ready to go) Onto my phone, rubbed the sticker saying to rub, and watched the bubbles disappear. You wait 30 seconds, remove the sticker you rubbed and the frame comes off. A sticker tab tells you to remove the cover and your install is nearly done. I had 1 tiny little bubble at the top. I used the included squeegee and pushed it out in 2 tries. That\u2019s it, install done, and it\u2019s perfect. Looks every bit as professional as the Apple install did. Covers the phone absolutely perfect. I will never go back to the in store install, this is my brand from now on.I just ordered another kit for my wife, and to keep a few as a backup.Cool note: while some kits include two+ pieces of glass, this includes two complete setups. The glass already installed in the installation frame, wipes, etc. There is literally no room for mistakes. If you clean your phone properly so there are no marks or dust, and it\u2019s not that hard, you will have a perfectly installed glass cover.The edges feel nice and rounded. The look is sharp. I am beyond happy for the deal I got and the price!",

El telefono quedara centrado y el cristal acomodado en perfecta posicion sobre el telefono.Presionas con el dedo en el centro donde se indica y deslizas de arriba a abajo. Veras como el cristal se empieza a adherir y a quedar completamente asentado en tu telefono. En ocasiones, peque\u00f1as particulas quedan aunque lo limpies bien, pero este cristal y su pegamente las difuminan muy bien.En otras ocasiones, burbujas de aire quedan sobre el telefono, pero usando su pa\u00f1o limpiador y la peque\u00f1a espatula incluida, solo deslizas sobre las burbujas para sacarlas hasta las orillas y listo tendras una instalacion profesional, sin burbujas y muy rapido.El kit contiene dos cristales, asi que tienes un repuesto.

                "reviewText": "This is the third time I've purchased a Spigen screen protector for my iPhone, but the first time I've purchased this kit which includes the case to install the screen protector.I don't know why I didn't order this kit before! I struggled to make sure the screen protector fit perfectly on my iPhone without the kit, and had more than a few fumbles, but this kit makes it so easy! You literally just peel the film (backing) away from the screen protector in the base case, plop your iPhone in there and voila! It automatically places the screen protector on the iPhone perfectly! I can't believe how fast and easy this was.You can't beat the price either- you receive two screen protectors with two bases in this kit, which is great.I can also attest to how strong and durable these screen protectors are. As I mentioned I've purchased Spigen screen protectors before, just without this kit. I've dropped my iPhone twice, and each time the screen protector did its job and the glass screen of my iPhone did not break. The screen protector cracked, but the glass screen was intact and pristine. I will never, ever use an iPhone without this screen protector.If you are spending hundreds of dollars on an iPhone, do yourself the favor of purchasing this screen protector to save your investment and protect your iPhone. It's well worth it",
