                "reviewText": "Great case for the money.My nanny asked me to pick up a new leather wallet case for her when she bought her new phone. I showed her a few options, including this LK case as well as others that were in the $20-$30+ range. She chose the LK.I wasn't sure what to expect for a leather case at this price point, but the LK case is on par with some of the more expensive cases out there. It is sturdy, high quality, looks good, and provides protection around the entire phone.Others cases feel like cheap cardboard, but this case is thick enough where it doesn't bend from repeated use. At the same time, it is thin enough to close completely and look sleek. Having the wallet feature built in is a huge plus as it reduces any chance of forgetting your phone, or dropping your phone because you are carrying too many things in your hands. Note that the more things you pack into the card slots, then there will be a space between the phone screen and the cover, but that is to be expected. This is usually noticeable as you pack in wads of cash. Regardless, it still provides protection as the magnetic flap holds the case closed and the rubber sleeve covers the edges.There is a built-in rubber sleeve in the case where you put your phone into and it fits great. It provides protection all around the sides (and back) of your phone while not covering the edge screen. The fit is secure but easy to get your phone in and out off. The cutouts for the buttons, headphone jack, and charging port are also a perfect fit and easily accessible while the phone is in the case.All-in-all, a great case with plenty of protection.",

Comes with plenty of wipes, dust absorbers, and a plastic guide made perfectly for my phone model. Very easy installation following the video on their website, took less than five minutes. I was able to get all the bubbles out with their supplied cardboard squeegee and my thumb, just like they showed in the video. Camera lens protector was a little bit trickier to get stuck on correctly but it seems like it won't effect the quality of my photos. Very satisfied.",

                "reviewText": "I've always liked this style of case. Super handy while going on vacation as it can basically be an alternative for a purse that can carry all of the basics (as long as you have a picket for your lipstick or chapstick, lol). Wrist strap is critical for using it in this way, & this phone has it!This is the first time I bought this brand. I'm really impressed with the quality of the material, feels like it will last a long time. I bought the purple, and the color is the exact purple I prefer - not too red or too blue. I like that I have access to my real buttons thru cutouts. Although the fingerprint hole is pretty deep & is a tad hard to reach. But but still works is isn't really bothersome.If I had wish with this case, I wish the magnetized flap the holds the case closed was magnetized both ways. This way when the case is folded backwards for use of the phone screen it would hold that direction as well.The #1 test for me is if the audio jack port is accessible with the jack itself. I've not found a phone case of any style that I don't have to take the case off to use the audio jack because the hole is the case is too small. I will report back soon. Luckily it's very easy to take the phone out & reinsert, in case it's too small of a hole. I can always widen the hole with a sharp knife or scissors too.I would definitely recommend the case!",

                "reviewText": "Install wasn't a snap, you'll definitely want to watch the video on their site (don't worry, the link is on the inside of the packaging). But once it's on, you'll be glad you made the purchase. Everything fit nicely with my iPad case after the screen was on, due to the laser cut precision. The screen is thick & scratch resistant, and my fear was that it wouldn't respond well to the apple Pencil I use with my iPad. No worries there either, it works as if nothing as on at all. The tempered glass can still get finger prints and smudges, but they come right off easily with a stroke of a shirt/cloth. Oh, and there's 2 screen protectors in a package, so if you ever need to cover it again, you already have one (but why would you when it's so strong, the have a lifetime warranty on it to begin with), so even more of a reason to be happy with getting this screen protector.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the LK case for my Samsung Galaxy S 9+ phone. It was a perfect fit for the phone with an area for an ID and credit cards. My phone is lilac, so the purple was a plus with a handy strap and magnetic closure. The material is soft and looks and feels like real leather without the price. There are several colors available, even the shiny bling if you are into those type of designs. If you so desire, you can get other colors as your taste may change. For now, I am pleased with the product and will plan to use the company again if I need another phone case. I definitely recommend buying the product if you need a phone case that covers your complete phone minus the button holes on the sides for your phone.",
