The plastic flexibility is the exact reason why we call it tempered glass screen protector. Tempered glass is a type of safety glass that is stronger than ordinary glass. 2. It cannot be seen from the appearance that it is glass or plastic. As a customer, what can we do to identify it? There is an easy, quick, cost-effective way to test it yourself, and it's very accurate. Most plastics have a melting point between 160 and 210 degrees Celsius, and glass materials are at least over 1400 degrees Celsius, so is there a lighter around? 3. Does it come with a cleaning wipe to use prior to placing on the phone? Yes, the package includes: 4*Guide Stickers, 4*Wet Wipe&4*Dry Wipe,2*Dust Absorber. 4. How can I remove bubbles? Use the kit in the package to clean the screen before placing the screen protector. If there are bubbles,try to gently press the bubbles with your finger or with a ruler,but the screen surface needs a thin cloth pad to avoid scratching the protector. 5. How can I remove a cracked glass screen protector? Lift the screen protector with the card from any corner of the screen protector, then hold the corner and remove slowly. (If you find CHIP or CRACK on the screen protector, for your safety, please wear gloves when removing the screen protector.)",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this screen protector on my iPhone 13 Mini for just under 6 months, and just now got to see if it works.For some context, I try to be careful with my phone, but I am clumsy and inevitably end up dropping it on the floor about 2-3 times per week. Usually this is on the carpet, but it has happened on linoleum and black top more than a few times since using this protector. It has held up intact through all of that.What finally did it was dropping it on the very edge of a small, hard plastic (melamine type material?) garbage bin. This, of all things, caused the screen protector to crack. I think it must have hit JUST right, on the edge of the protector, for that to happen. But my phone screen is 100% fine! I dealt with the annoying cracks for a few days, but then replaced it with the second protector from the package.It is crystal clear and doesn\u2019t have any effect on the screen\u2019s appearance. It is also pretty easy to install and fits perfectly. The directions are clear, but don\u2019t have an explanation for the guide stickers that are included. I didn\u2019t use them but they might be useful for some people/phones. The only complaint I have is that the \u201cwet wipes\u201d included were not wet at all. This wasn\u2019t a big deal for me though because I always have lens/electronic alcohol wipes laying around.I would definitely recommend this protector, and will probably buy a new package to keep on hand in case I have another particularly klutzy moment. \ud83d\udc4d",

                "reviewText": "To be honest, I really loved both the adhesion and image quality. But, at the same time, without an alignment tool / guide, it frankly, at least for first timers around such as myself, anyway, can find it rather challenging / tricky. Now, I\u2019ve applied screen protectors before, but the thing is, the last two times I did, it was for my previous iPhone, which I had an alignment tool. That\u2019s the downside of this: it doesn\u2019t have one supplied. However, I must say, the good really seems to outweigh the bad here, as they even offer a full refund/replacement service, including & even if you installed it wrong or ended up with *any* bubbles, dust, or lint, for example. Having said that, friendly customer service is always a \u201cplus\u201d in my book and surely can go a long way, as that\u2019s what keeps them coming back.Anyway, I haven\u2019t really installed it as accurately as I possibly could, but then, that was my first try, so as I said, it can potentially be tricky, especially on the first shot. Wasn\u2019t that bad though, just slightly misaligned but good for the most part, which is why I didn\u2019t take it off or at least not just yet requested a replacement (though I was quite frustrated at the time it was applied). Then again, the alignment was just a little off, & the adhesion was *almost* perfect (just one small bubble on the bottom right hand corner of the screen). I\u2019ll see if I can deal and live with it, I think I can. The main thing though is that, even though it turned out to be just slightly slanted, & a bit higher than I wanted it to be, the whole screen is still covered, and the front-facing camera has no blockage or interference either. Add to that the fact that there\u2019s barely any dust underneath and that the lens protector additionally was applied real well, I am really glad with my purchase regardless, as the good outweighs the bad, pretty much. Of course though, if I feel the need to, I can always contact customer service for a refund or replacement, as I feel is needed. Just remember to take your time with this and watch the tutorial video\u2026 I\u2019d say I still did pretty well for my first try, first time around.Btw, my cousin referred me to this product as he has one himself, and I was convinced that it would be the perfect (or almost perfect) choice. Basically as good as it gets. I\u2019d look no further: this is *probably* as good and reliable a screen protector can get for your iPhone: it\u2019s an industry leader in technology across the globe which just so happens to have so many customers worldwide. Only downside of course if any, really, is that there\u2019s no alignment tool. But keep in mind the fact that sometimes alignment tools can be unreliable and mess up the outcome of application(s) when it comes down to applying screen protectors in *some cases*, which my cousin also mentioned to me that a friend or relative of his used a screen protector but actually had trouble using the alignment tool (obviously for another product which falls under the same genre / category). But, otherwise, I\u2019d say go for it. Once again, as I said earlier, the good greatly outweighs the bad when it comes to this particular product.So, good luck and enjoy this great product. And remember the 100% Money Back/Replacement Guarantee, should anything fail or fall short, EVEN IF IT\u2019S A MISTAKE YOU MADE. IT\u2019S OK I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll uphold their end of the deal. Have a good one, and please get this product (or another screen protector) from this same brand depending on which iPhone model you have. I\u2019m confident you won\u2019t regret it. All you have to do is contact them, and you should be good.P.S. The great pricing, quality of the product, & Money Back Replacement Guarantee seems to make this a no-brainer: both the deal you get & the integrity of the product are unmatched, so if you have a smartphone (iPhone or Android device) and you don\u2019t have a screen protector yet, GET IT! Get it NOW! I promise you won\u2019t be disappointed. Have a nice day!",
