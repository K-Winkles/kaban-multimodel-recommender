                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Terrific screen protector",
                "reviewText": "My title for this review is \u201cterrific screen protector\u201d for three reasons. First, it fits perfectly on my S10e, second, it works perfectly and doesn\u2019t interfere with control of apps and screens, and third, and perhaps most important, it went on easier and better than any screen protector I\u2019ve ever installed before (and I\u2019ve installed many).The frame provided worked to control precisely where the screen protector should go so there was no danger it would be put on at an angle or in the wrong place and have to be moved. The frame came off easily after the screen protector was in place and I was in business. In fact where many screen protectors require you to work diligently to squeeze out bubbles left after installation, this almost installed itself. I literally watched the screen protector settle down and the large bubble gradually disappear. Using the included stiff plastic \u201csqueegee\u201d to finish the job was a nice touch if almost not necessary.Having raved about this screen protector I\u2019ll offer a few small suggestions for improvement or warnings to a screen protector \u201cnewbie\u201d. I didn\u2019t need the dust absorber so I didn\u2019t use it. You may or may not need one. The alcohol pad is necessary, to completely clean the screen and remove any fingerprints or finger oils, so use that thoroughly and then use the wipe afterward to make sure the screen is completely clean and dry before applying the screen protector. Be very careful you don\u2019t touch the screen after cleaning.Put the frame on the phone over the screen before you try to install the screen protector, and make sure that you orient the screen protector with the very small hole to go over the camera lens opening on the upper right of the screen. Lastly, pull the protective film only about half way off the sticky side of the screen protector and while you\u2019re holding that back to expose the sticky back side of the screen protector, carefully place it into position over the phone and within the frame you placed over the phone earlier. When you have it properly aligned you can then carefully press the screen protector down onto the phone while pulling the protective film the rest of the way off.At that point you\u2019ve likely got a perfect installation and using the included stiff plastic squeegee will finish the job. You might also want to use your fingers around the edges just to make sure, but I expect you\u2019ll be very pleased with the results. BTW, a phone case is a nice addition to protect the edges of the screen protector from getting caught and lifted from the screen. They are inexpensive and provide a lot of additional protection.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered and installed this screen protector just under a year ago. It's a 2 pack, so I figured having a spare would be good. It's a sturdy, thick protector, but touch sensitivity is still good, at least when you adjust it in settings for having a screen protector.The installation process went pretty smoothly--their online video instructions helped, though I found that I had fewer bubbles beneath the screen (basically none) if instead of just dropping the protector on the phone that I put the top on first and then lowered the rest at a slight angle, pressing down with the cardboard applicator as I went. I had a couple bubbles on the first protector that I couldn't get out because I didn't do that procedure for the entire application, but on the second protector, I had no bubbles doing it that way.Fast forward 11 months and my protector had a couple dings from the phone getting dropped on gravel, but no big deal. I was starting to think about swapping it out for the second protector, but then one day I discovered a crack clear across the protector. I pulled out the box to get the second protector, and noticed the lifetime guarantee on the box, so I e-mailed about the crack and they promptly sent me another protector. Kudos to a company that's responsive and stands behind their products. When I get my next phone, I know where I'm going to get the screen protector!",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE APRIL 2020: Finally dropped my Galaxy S10e phone.Damn. 5ft drop straight down face first on uneven stone tile in my doorway. So dumb, I was video calling during our present quarantine and walking around with my phone in a stand/holder and holding the stand but not the phone. So dumb. Anyway, picked it up and the screen was cracked...but no, wait....the screen PROTECTOR was cracked my actual screen was fine (sorry no picture, I only have one phone/camera)! Replaced the protector with the 2nd of 3 that this comes with and I'm back to brand new looking. Still got one left. It saved me. So some good news coming out of this Pandemic. Y'all can relax, my phone is fine. Now 5 stars instead of 4 cuz it actually works as advertised. Thanks MP-Mall!Original Review: All in all I'm happy with the product. I had an IQ Shield I tried before this and was furious with the compete disaster the product and application process was. I wasn't too hopeful about this one unfortunately, but this one (being Tp'd Glass vs film) has got my approval. I have 4 stars instead of 5 because of ONE TINY BUBBLE on the top right of phone. A spec of something got in (it's 10min since I installed it so it might go away tomorrow and if it does I'll update the review) but you can't see it with the white led backlight on. Does show up with black background or with screen off. I can deal.I do however, see why some people were upset about the 'coverage' from side to side. It JUST BARELY, LIKE BY A HAIR, doesn't go over on each side as many would like. Again, I notice it, but, looking at YouTube or any app head on it is not noticable. If you want to obsess about it go right ahead and keep looking. For my part I'm done looking for a mfr that's \"perfect\". NO such thing. But MP-Mall comes damn near close. Easy AF application and was super easy to press down sides for complete seal all way around (except as I side my little spec bubble). Squeegee is durable and the guide is accurate. They made it slightly narrow I believe to allow edge functionality on s10e and for cases.But DEFINITELY watch the installation video... a couple times, it's worth it. And I have 2 more screens left if I want to replace at some point or if it gets cracked.MP-Mall is the best you'll find I believe so go for it.",

                "reviewText": "What an amazing screen! Super easy to install, zero bubbles, and very very clear. It doesn't look like an added screen, just blends in perfectly with the phone. The package comes with 2 screen protectors for front and 2 for the camera at the back, wipes, a cloth, dust lifting strips, and screen protector alignment tool <-- a lot of stuff for this price and definitely top notch quality.",

                "reviewText": "This is my first ever purchase of a screen protector, and installing it was straightforward. I just followed their linked tutorial video.The screen looks and feels extremely good. As this is my first screen protector, I am not sure what the touch sensitivity should be like, but it is very slightly less responsive than the bare screen.It seems very durable. I applied lots of pressure when I was trying to remove air bubbles and that did not cause any visible damage to the screen.",

The frame was incredibly helpful and they provide all the tools to make it work - alcohol swab, microfiber cloth, and dust collector.It took me minimal effort to apply mine, and I'm awful at putting on screen protectors. I'm prone to dust and hair getting collected underneath but the application was flawless. A few hard workovers with the cardboard to get rid of sparse bubbles and it was all good!I feel SOOOO much better having this on my phone now.",
