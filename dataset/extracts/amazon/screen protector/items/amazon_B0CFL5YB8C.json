The screen protector did its job and the watch face was fine. The second screen protector would not seal around the edges no matter how much I pressed. Its centered on the watch face so I'm not sure why the 1st one worked so well and why the 2nd won't adhere correctly",

If you are coordination is less than great, which is true for me. One of them cracked fairly quickly after putting it on and I thought that one was pretty well centered. The second one I put on was not centered perfectly despite my best efforts and that one began looking bad pretty quickly because of the off-centeredness. I never actually installed the third one because it was so frustrating to install the first two. In total, the first two only lasted a few weeks. Weeks. I suspect someone more skilled would do a better job of lining it up. And if lined up right, I think it's a pretty good protector.",
