You do have to remove the case the iPhone is in before you can use and install the screen protector guide. Followed the instructions and ended up with a perfectly fitting screen protector. Initially I did have a couple of small \"bubbles\" in the glass, but was able to work one out and the other disappeared after the phone was used and the screen warmed up. There was no change in the touch or sight of the phone. Works and looks perfectly on my iPhone 15. It does slow down fingerprints also.",

Perfect alignment and no bubbles!! Excellent product.",

Now that it\u2019s on my phone I completely forget that it\u2019s there, it looks so seamless and feels absolutely AMAZING.Never felt quite so enthused by protective phone materials before but it\u2019s honestly made my day (tbf it has been a rather rubbish day but I\u2019m sure it would have made my day regardless!)",
