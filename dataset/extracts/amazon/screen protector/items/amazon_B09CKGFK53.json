My poor smartwatch has taken a few tumbles during my workout sessions (blame it on burpees!), and I was constantly worried about a cracked screen. Enter these awesome Tempered Glass protectors from Suoman!They were a breeze to put on \u2013 no bubbles, no fuss \u2013 and now I can clumsily lunge and squat to my heart's content without a care in the world. Seriously, the other day I snagged my watch on the edge of a doorway, and all I got was a tiny heart attack (and maybe a slightly dented ego). The screen itself? Perfectly unscathed!So, if you're a butterfingers like me, or just want some extra peace of mind for your precious smartwatch, these Suoman protectors are a must-have. They're invisible, barely noticeable, and they do their job flawlessly. Five stars all the way!",

However, the quality is as good as other glass screen protectors I have gotten for my phone, so I am happy with it and have three backups should anything happen.",

Although it is very basic (no install template/case, no squeegee) it was surprisingly easy to install, on 1st try, and no air bubbles when I used a squeegee from a previous kit. it is very good looking and very sensitive to touch. I can't comment on it's durability yet but am hopeful it is long lasting as well as providing good protection. Based on experience so far would recommend this one.",
