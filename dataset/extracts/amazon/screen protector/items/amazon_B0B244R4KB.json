The other ones are cheap and crack with every drop of your phone. But with this one, I\u2019ve dropped my phone a good amount of times, and it\u2019s still intact. There are no scratches or cracks anywhere!!! The plastic guide helped place the protector seamlessly & with no bubbles. I cannot recommend it enough. We\u2019ve bought two packs of these and will continue to buy them for future phones if the quality remains.",

It delivers exceptional edge-to-edge protection while maintaining high clarity for an uninterrupted viewing experience.The oleophobic coating is a blessing for anyone who despises fingerprints and smudges, keeping the screen looking clean and pristine. The screen protector feels great in the hands, mirroring the phone's natural touch response.Compatibility is a non-issue, as it fits perfectly with every single case I've tried. Plus, the installation process is not only easy but actually enjoyable, thanks to the innovative EZ Fit tray.For all the iPhone lovers out there, I can't recommend the Spigen Glas.tR EZ Fit enough.

                "reviewText": "I like how easy it is is apply the screen protector and when done right, it adheres well without bubbles. They provide all the tools to clean, remove dust and apply the screen protector with the plastic guide/frame that you really can't go wrong as long as you follow the steps including cleaning your hands. This is my 2nd set as I've dropped my phone many times. The glass screen protector is durable and my screen has been protected from many falls.",

                "reviewText": "I watched several youtube videos to decide on this brand for durability over others. Then I first made sure all the tips to correctly apply. Installation was exactly like videos and completed in minutes with care. I made sure to remove all dust first and removed all air bubbles after so there is a complete adhesion. It was a bit difficult to get the first layer to lift to peel away because the tiny corner tab would not separate from the actual protector. It was difficult to get a finger nail between the two layers and the actual protector kept trying to peeling up too. I noticed this in the video reviews also so be warned. The plastic frame perfectly lined up with my phone. After install the glass is very smooth and creamy feeling and glides swipes nice. The glass comes to the edge of my case and feels seamless. Only glitch is face recognition is not 100% now. About every 5th time I need to hold it right up to my face so there is a difference between iphone glass and having this protector glass. Also, occasionally it misses keystrokes too so i'm getting more auto correct errors when typing. This could be due to the extra smooth surface glide but it is noticeable from the previous month using iphone without the protector. I recommend this protector for overall ease of application and complete adhesion. I think the face recognition will be corrected by my redoing that on my iphone now. I think the extra glide will be nice and I'll get used to it. Overall this is a great product.",

                "reviewText": "As someone who's had their fair share of smartphone mishaps, I understand the importance of a reliable screen protector. Enter the Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector [GlasTR EZ FIT] for iPhone 14 Pro, a product that promises not only to protect your device but to make the installation process as hassle-free as possible. Here's my take on it.Installation: The EZ FIT installation kit is a game-changer. Spigen has ingeniously solved the most daunting aspect of screen protector application - alignment. The kit includes a frame that you place over your iPhone, ensuring the protector aligns perfectly with your screen every time. The process is so straightforward and bubble-free, it almost feels like magic. For someone who lacks the steady hands of a surgeon, this feature alone makes the GlasTR EZ FIT worth it.Protection: Made from high-quality tempered glass, the screen protector feels sturdy yet surprisingly thin. It doesn't add noticeable bulk to the phone, maintaining the sleek profile of the iPhone 14 Pro. The glass claims to have a 9H hardness rating, and while I haven't gone out of my way to test this claim by dropping my phone, it has survived everyday knocks and bumps without a scratch.Clarity and Sensitivity: One of my biggest gripes with screen protectors in the past has been how they can dull the display or reduce touch sensitivity. This is not the case with the GlasTR EZ FIT. My iPhone's display remains as vibrant and crisp as ever, and touch sensitivity is unaffected. It's as if the protector isn't there, which is precisely what you want.Case Compatibility: The \"Case Friendly\" design is not just a marketing gimmick. I've paired it with a Spigen case, and the synergy between the two is perfect. There's enough edge space to ensure the case doesn't lift the protector, a common issue with lesser screen protectors.Value: While the GlasTR EZ FIT is priced slightly higher than some competitors, the combination of easy installation, effective protection, and flawless compatibility with cases justifies the cost. It's an investment in peace of mind, knowing your phone's screen is safeguarded against everyday hazards.Final Thoughts: The Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector [GlasTR EZ FIT] for iPhone 14 Pro is a top-tier product that delivers on its promises. It's a perfect blend of protection, functionality, and user-friendliness. Whether you're a tech enthusiast or someone who simply wants to keep their iPhone safe, this screen protector is a wise choice. Highly recommended.",
