                "media_text": "Question: Why can't the screen protector cover the entire screen? Answer: Because the screen edges of the iPhone 8, 7, 6S, 6, SE 2020 Phone models have a certain curvature, there will be a wide range of bubbles in the full-screen protector, which will affect the appearance of the phone. In response to this problem, KATIN specially designed a slightly smaller iPhone 8, 7, 6S, 6, SE 2020 screen protector, which improves the bubble problem and can be better used with mobile phone cases. Question \uff1aWill it be difficult to install a mobile phone screen protector? Answer\uff1a Every customer who buys a product in KATIN will get an instruction manual on how to install the screen protector, which is accompanied by a very intuitive and detailed video. If you have any problems during the installation process, you can let us help you. Question \uff1aThe product is cracked or the model is wrong after receiving it? Answer\uff1aWhen you get a broken product, it may be caused by a large squeeze or impact during the long-term transportation. When you receive the wrong product, it may be that the warehouse receives a large amount of goods and the product is in confusion during sorting. Don't worry, Please contact Amazon service in time or get in touch with us via Amazon email following steps: Go to Your Orders, find your order in the list, and click Problem with order. and the problem will be solved well for you. Question \uff1aWhy does the edge of the screen protector break after being used for a period of time? Answer\uff1aThe screen protector is made of AF explosion-proof PET and other materials after heat treatment and tempering, so the surface is hard enough, scratch-resistant, abrasion-resistant, explosion-proof, waterproof, and oil-proof, which can help your phone block daily collisions and scratches. When subjected to a severe impact, the screen protector will replace the mobile phone screen to bear all the impact and break. Within the range that Screen Protector can withstand, it can protect the phone screen from damage when dropped or hit. However , although the hardness of the screen protector is very high, it is very brittle, especially the corners, just like breaking chocolate, the corners are easier to break, which is why the protector will crack in the corners after using it for a period of time. If you want to extend the use time of the protector, you can use it with a mobile phone case.",

I started the process, and had to finish it or waste the screen protector. To my surprise, and delight, I was able to get the screen changed without any problems, even in the dark! I used both the wet and dry towels, and the dust absorption thing, but I couldn\u2019t really understand exactly how to use the guide stickers. I tore the box open and destroyed the instructions in the process (the instructions are printed on the inside of the box), but I still got the screen nice and straight, without any air bubbles.

Immediately I noticed that they weren\u2019t too sticky and it left a bubble all around the edges. I thought I did it wrong, but went on to place the second one on and it did the same thing. I had them replaced only to have the new ones do the exact same thing. So I will be returning all four. The packaging was good, and there was no visible damage. It\u2019s just a bad product.",
