The plastic flexibility is the exact reason why we call it tempered glass screen protector. Tempered glass is a type of safety glass that is stronger than ordinary glass. 2. It cannot be seen from the appearance that it is glass or plastic. As a customer, what can we do to identify it? There is an easy, quick, cost-effective way to test it yourself, and it's very accurate. Most plastics have a melting point between 160 and 210 degrees Celsius, and glass materials are at least over 1400 degrees Celsius, so is there a lighter around? 3. Does it come with a cleaning wipe to use prior to placing on the phone? Yes, the package includes: 4*Guide Stickers, 4*Wet Wipe & 4*Dry Wipe, 2*Dust Absorber 4. How can I remove bubbles? Use the kit in the package to clean the screen before placing the screen protector. If there are bubbles,try to gently press the bubbles with your finger or with a ruler,but the screen surface needs a thin cloth pad to avoid scratching the protector. 5. How can I remove a cracked glass screen protector? Lift the screen protector with the card from any corner of the screen protector, then hold the corner and remove slowly. (If you find CHIP or CRACK on the screen protector, for your safety, please wear gloves when removing the screen protector.)",

                "reviewText": "I debated whether I needed a two-pack of these glass screen protectors since my last one lasted two years. It turned out that I not only needed two but, within a week, needed three -- no fault of the product. The first time whenI placed the glass, I wasn't careful enough, and it didn't line up properly. Once the glass makes even the smallest contact with the phone screen, there's no readjusting it, unlike a previous brand I had. I had to remove that first attempt and throw it away. I needed the second piece to rectify my initial mistake.Within a week of installing the second piece, I dropped a garden trowel on the face of my phone. The Ailum glass cracked, but the phone face was perfectly intact, thanks to that extra layer of protection. I have been using screen protectors for the phones for years, but this is first time I needed the glass to do its job. It did. You want the protector to break/chip to take the force away from your phone's screen. Because of that protection, I promptly ordered another two-pack.The glass is clear, and it does not change the sensitivity of the touch screen. The camera protector is a nice touch, although you need to be extra careful to remove all dust specks before sealing.The selling price is great. I'm glad I ordered the two-pack, especially given my mistakes both in installation and in dropping something on my phone.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",

I have spent as much as $40 for the name brands and I'm so happy to have found this one! Great price, comes with 2 plus everything you need for install, even covers for the lens on the camera. Applied in less than 2 minutes. It adhered completely on its own, no bubbles to push out towards the edge. I was happy enough to write a review about it- and that's saying something! Great purchase- will save and buy again in the future for new models.",
