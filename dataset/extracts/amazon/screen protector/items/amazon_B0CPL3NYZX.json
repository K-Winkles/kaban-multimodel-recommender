                "reviewText": "I wanted to give one more shot with screen protectors! I have bought three different brands & they were more expensive ! I am very happy I did, because I have went through about 9 to 10 screen protectors & no matter how I tried I could never get all the bubble out! Yes I followed the instructions completely! Well the TQLGY screen protector went on the first time & absolutely no bubbles! All I did was follow the video & it works! Screen look great can't even tell I have a screen protector! Very high quality highly recommend!",
