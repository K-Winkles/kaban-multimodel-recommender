Luvvitt's LIQUIDGLASS is also mainly made of SiO2 that is in liquid form. It covers the screen with an additional layer of glass similar to a tempered glass. The difference: Luvvitt LIQUIDGLASS is not a tempered glass or a film. It is a cutting-edge, super durable, completely transparent liquid wipe-on screen protector that bonds to the glass of your device offering greatly enhanced scratch, moisture, and impact resistance. The German formula creates an invisible protective coating that increases the devices screen to 9H hardness. More in-depth: At microscopic level, a glass is not as smooth as it seems. It's imperfect with gaps and pores. This porous surface creates points of weakness when exposed to sharp objects or impacts. Luvvitt LIQUIDGLASS fills in the microscopic pores and coats the surface with an additional layer, resulting in stronger and more scratch resistant surface.",

Remove all traces of the cleaner and any lint by thoroughly buffing the glass with the microfiber cloth supplied. APPLY Apply the LIQUIDGLASS coating wipe, supplied in Sachet 2 to the glass surface in a circular motion. Ensure the screen is completely coated including the edges. DRY Allow the glass surface to cure for at least 10 minutes. The longer you let it cure without touching the better. For this reason, it's recommended to apply it at night. The screen can be touched after 10 minutes however, glass surface will continue curing for the next 24 hours. BUFF Use the microfiber towel supplied in a circular motion to buff out and remove any excess residue from the glass surface.",

                "reviewText": "I recently tried the Luvvitt Liquid Glass, and it has truly exceeded my expectations as a screen protector. This cutting-edge solution offers remarkable durability and transparency, providing enhanced scratch, moisture, and impact resistance for my device.What sets this liquid screen protector apart is its composition. Made in Germany, it consists of silica dioxide (Si02), essentially microscopic glass particles suspended in a liquid solution. Upon application, it creates an invisible protective coating that elevates the screen's hardness to 9H. It's like adding an extra layer of glass, filling in imperfections, and significantly improving the overall resilience of the device screen.The application process is a breeze, ensuring a bubble-free experience with a universal fit that's perfect for curved screens and tablets. The wipe-on do-it-yourself method simplifies the process, making it accessible for all users.A notable feature is the product's complete harmlessness and invisibility once applied. It seamlessly integrates with the device, providing protection without compromising the aesthetic appeal. It's reassuring to know that it's compatible with all mobile devices, phones, foldable phones, tablets, and smartwatches, including the latest models like Galaxy S22, iPhone 13, Google Pixel 6, and more. The versatility extends to curved and foldable screens, and it doesn't interfere with fingerprint sensors.It's essential to note that while the Liquid Glass enhances protection, it should not be used to repair broken screens or address existing scratches or damages. However, as a preventive measure, it's proven to be highly effective.",

                "reviewText": "This product is incredible! I used it on my Active 2 smartwatch and it created a perfect coating of glass that will help protect my watch from the bumps and scrapes it gets at work. If your device already has scratches, I recommend a mild (low content) diamond paste being used first to buff out all the scratches, as it will make this product apply evenly to the entire surface. My watch now looks like it did when it was first bought, and has a far better scratch-resistant surface. The instructions are crystal clear, as well, so follow them to the letter. I would recommend this for any smart device that gets a lot of wear and tear. I would have applied it to my smartphone, as well, but it currently has no blemishes and I'm very careful with it. In hindsight, though, I'd have been better off being overcautious, as this coating is likely stronger than the material my smartphone glass is made of. Still, at the price they charge, there's no downside to purchasing a separate kit for each device you need to protect. There is no reason to hesitate. If you want an incredible, affordable scratch protector, there is no easier solution than this.",

I bought it outright. Anyway I was looking for something to protect the screen and came across this! What a fabulous little product. It was easy to use and install. My phone looks great the screen is bright no difference with it",

The instructions does say to apply the coating and wait for it to set overnight which is a small hassle but not a big issue. This is the second phone that I've used a scratch resistant screen coating on and so far this one is better than the previous brand. I've had my phone with the coating for about two months now and have seen no issues.",

Wipe it on let it dry and wipe it off.However it does nothing. 9H hardness is meaningless it's not the mohs hardness scale it's the pencil hardness scale not a joke do a bit of research it's marking misdirection to fool people . No glass or wipe on coating is going to be a 9 on the mohs scale. The hardest glass reaches around a 7 while normal glass is around 6.5 . Also the coating this stuff leaves is so miniscule it's worthless.From a actually use my screen scratched in two days from the little bit of sand that got into my pocket. I also tested it with a hardness test pick and it scratched just the same as the glass without the protector.Do some research before buying any liquid screen protector none work it's just physics. I didn't do the research and I wasted money. Get a real screen protector and remember 9H hardness is meaningless no screen protector is going to be harder or more scratch resistant than your phones screen they are just there to be a sacrifical layer so your actual screen doesn't get damaged. Do you really think these small time companies making phone accessories are going to have more advanced tech than the world's most advanced glass manufacturing company.",
