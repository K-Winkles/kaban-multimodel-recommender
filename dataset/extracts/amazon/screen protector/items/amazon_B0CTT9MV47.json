                "reviewText": "I bought these screen protectors, happily and confidently for my beautiful Galaxy s23 Ultra after looking for a while and considering several other. However, seeing over 30K favorable customer ratings AND a reasonable price, made this an easy choice. I mean if you can't trust that, then what? Well, I followed the very simple and limited directions (which was also a plus in my book!), only to have the screen pop off after sliding from my cars seat to the foot well. ??? This was 10 minutes after putting it on. So, I stopped and re-applied. It's still on 3 days later, but the contact with the screen is terrible. The right top corner along the edge isn't making flush contact so that there is a clicking after pressing down on it. The middle also has issues with contact because I have to press down at least twice firmly to select or scroll. I've only seen 1 complaint in reviews about this for my devices model. What gives? I want to protect my expensive and beautiful screen, but I also want to be able to use my phone normally. Impaired function and performance is not what I wanted or expected?! There is another protector in the package, could this one just be defective? Should I try the other one? Ugh. I may just see if a replacement will get the job done or return for a refund and buy something else.",
