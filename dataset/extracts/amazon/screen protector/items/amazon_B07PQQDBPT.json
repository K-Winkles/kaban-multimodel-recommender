                "reviewText": "I have bought a set of these in the past, and I guess I never got to write a review for them.A few things to note: I have used these privacy screens for the original iPhone screen, as well as for a screen bought from a 3rd party and had a friend of my mine replace it (original screen was beginning to lift).With the original screen, I saw no issues. The screen maintained its brightness and was very clear, but at a certain angle you could see it had the fade in/out for privacy. Everything was still very clear.With the 3rd Party screen, there's one thing that really bugged me. The screen itself was also very bright and just as nice as the original apple screen. However, when I placed the screen protector, I noticed lines going across the screen. You know how when you take a picture of a screen, those curvy lines appear? I had straight diagonal ones appear, and I truly think it's just the 3rd party screen acting a little rebellious with the privacy screen. Now it doesn't bother me as much as when I had initially noticed it - because at the end of the day my phone still works.Hope this helps anyone reading!",
