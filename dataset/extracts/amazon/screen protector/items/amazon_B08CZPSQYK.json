                "reviewText": "Through the years I have been impressed with the protection provided by their phone cases.So when I was looking for a dependable glass screen protector for my phones, I had to first check the ones from this brand.Having previously purchased a version for my iPhone 13 Pro, and another one for an earlier 11 Pro Max, I wanted a similar peace of mind for my iPhone SE. To this day I remain happy for all three.This version for the SE has a slightly different alignment apparatus for foolproof installation. It may require a bit more care than the alignment frames used for the iP 11- and 13- Pros, but the brand has done a very good job in keeping mistakes at a bare minimum.My simple advice for anyone would be to strictly follow the use of the alcohol wipe to initially clean your phone's display; followed by a faithful \"stick-spotting\" off of any dust particles from the screen (using the \"sticky dust remover pad\") regardless of how clean or \"dust-free\" you believe your working conditions are.Upon placing the actual (glass) protector with the help of the included alignment frame, bubbles may temporarily appear/remain on the screen. But in my experience, they are easily and immediately removed toward the nearest edges by the use of the included card or \"squeegee\".I like the fact that the screen protector does not interfere with the phone case in any way.For relative ease in its installation, and the fact that there the pack comes with more than one screen protector, I find this a very good kit to consider.",

The screen protector fits well, although, this particular version covers the front facing camera (not a deal breaker but something to note). The instructions and material provided make putting on the protector a simple procedure and the online video (QR code scan) is decent.HOWEVER, the screen protector installed had a small knick in it that could not be seen (manufacturing defect) until installed and resulted in a slight bubble on the edge of the install. There is no fix for this as the nick prevents the adhesive from a bond and allows air right back in. The bubble is small and my mom is fine with it - assumes her case will cover it.As a perfectionist, it would drive me nuts (haha). I bought a similar two pack for the iphone 12 mini and experienced the same issue - one of the screens had a knick (although this one was dead center). Ordered another set because I needed two and the bubble bothered me.Still cheaper than and install at the apple store.",

I\u2019ve used it on my previous phone and my new phone. It fit perfectly with my case. I haven\u2019t had to replace the screen protector on my phone, thankfully (after 2+ years with both). My daughter\u2019s screen protector was damaged after a drop, but the phone screen was perfectly fine (which is the point). It comes with two protectors, so you have an automatic backup or you can protect two phones. Highly recommended!",

                "reviewText": "My screen was cracked by a fall, and I needed to replace it. My first two installations of another brand failed with major bubbles that would not disappear. On a whim, I purchased this one and I LOVE the ability to add my own protector at home with confidence. This protector has been on for months now, and I am very pleased with the product and its durability.",

                "reviewText": "My wife was skeptical of the other unknown brands I had used but never had any trouble with. So we went with this better known brand that cost twice the price. Well the first on me scratched the first day and was was broken I\u2019m multiple places by the end of a month. I know you might be thinking \u201cwell, maybe she just dropped it or something!\u201d It\u2019s possible, uT she\u2019s normally VERY careful. So no big deal, I put the second one on.Impossible to get the bubbles along the edge to stay gone. Yes I watched the videos they provide. Yes I could easily squeeze the bubbles out. But they came back IMMEDIATELY upon releasing. And my wife said she always sees a rainbow-y shadow in the edges.Just overall a terrible experience. I\u2019ve already re-ordered the Ailun I used in the last (for half the price). When it arrives I\u2019ll chunk this second one I. The trash and never go with Spigen again. Big disappointment.",

                "reviewText": "I don't know why so many folks are saying it doesn't fit the SE 2020. It fits mine perfectly, but you do have to be careful installing it, and, of course, it doesn't cover the beveled edges, so it's good to pair this with some kind of case.It's important to get the screen as clean as possible (with provided wipes and sticker), use the included plastic guide, have a good overhead light so you can see dirt and air bubbles, and work slowly. Do not rely on that windshield-wiper-looking thing. Once you push down on it, if you try to peel it back and start again, it won't stick around the edges. If you get dust under it or if you push down while there's still an airbubble, I think you're stuck with that for the life of the protector. My first one lasted a year (with an airbubble). There's an invisible seal that holds it all together even after it cracks, but you should definitely remove the protector after it cracks even a little. If you don't it can scratch the screen. (At least the scratch on my screen isn't visible now that I have the second protector in place.)",
