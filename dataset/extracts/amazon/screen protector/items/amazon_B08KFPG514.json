After finding out that Spigen did not make a glass screen protector for the S20 FE 5G, I took a chance on this product from Supershieldz. I'm glad I did. This screen protector checks all the boxes, relatively inexpensive, easy to install, excellent touch sensitivity, oleo and hydrophobic coated, 2.5D rounded edges, and excellent overall fit. Highly recommended.",

Liked the whole sticker-Hinge installation method. Despite being simplistic it actually worked perfectly. Fingerprint reading still works perfect. Screen Actually seems more touch sensitive vs the plastic screen protector. Love that it came with 3 WHOLE installation kits so I can replace it a few times. Breathed some new life into my phone.",
