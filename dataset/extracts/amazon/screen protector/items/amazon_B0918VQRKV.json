Luvvitt's LIQUID GLASS is also mainly made of SiO2 that is in liquid form. It covers the screen with an additional layer of glass similar to a tempered glass. The difference: Luvvitt LIQUID GLASS is not a tempered glass or a film. It is a cutting-edge, super durable, completely transparent liquid wipe-on screen protector that bonds to the glass of your device offering greatly enhanced scratch, moisture, and impact resistance. The German formula creates an invisible protective coating that increases the devices screen to 9H hardness. More in-depth: At microscopic level, a glass is not as smooth as it seems. It's imperfect with gaps and pores. This porous surface creates points of weakness when exposed to sharp objects or impacts. Luvvitt LIQUID GLASS fills in the microscopic pores and coats the surface with an additional layer, resulting in stronger and more scratch resistant surface.",

Use the dry wipe supplied to apply. DRY Allow the glass surface to cure for at least 10 minutes. The longer you let it cure without touching the better. For this reason, it's recommended to apply it at night. The screen can be touched after 10 minutes however, glass surface will continue curing for the next 24 hours. BUFF Use the microfiber towel supplied in a circular motion to buff out and remove any excess residue from the glass surface.",
