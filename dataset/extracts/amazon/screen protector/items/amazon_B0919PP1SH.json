                "reviewText": "I have a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. Pretty big phone. Always getting fingerprints and smudges on the screen, always cleaning it off with some spray solution and a microfiber cloth. I used this stuff and noticed a difference right away. The screen has that just-cleaned smooth slickness and mirror shine for longer and doesn't require as much cleaning as often. It still gets some prints and smudges, though, so this isn't some magic cure for that problem. If you do any mobile gaming and require a smooth, glossy surface for your fingers to move smoothly across the screen, this is for you. This will help with that. As long as you follow the instructions and let the product cure for 10 minutes (I would give it a little more just to be safe) you should be good to go.",

When I purchased my phone two years ago, the Verizon rep applied liquid glass on my phone, which is comparable but much more expensive. I'm glad I found this and opted for the one without the warranty because I have insurance that would cover the issues if they happen. It allowed me 4 coats, double coating both mine and another phone. There's probably another application that it can do for a tablet or alike. Highly recommend.",
