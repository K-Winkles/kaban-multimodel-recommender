                "reviewText": "The ESR Armorite Glass Screen Protector has been amazing so far, with everything being thought of from its installation to its quality feel.The first thing that stands out about the ESR Armorite is its exceptional durability. It\u2019s crafted from a high-quality tempered glass that boasts an 9H hardness rating - this is my first time using a glass screen protector with this rating and I\u2019m in love.Despite its toughness, the Armorite screen protector doesn\u2019t compromise on clarity or touch sensitivity. The ultra-clear glass preserves the vibrant display of the 15 pro, and the responsiveness is as smooth as the original screen. This makes it perfect for both everyday use and more demanding tasks.Another feature that I appreciate is the hassle-free installation process. The package includes a full installation kit that made it easy to apply the screen protector without any bubbles or misalignment, a common issue that I\u2019ve ran into with other screen protectors.All in all, I know it\u2019s slightly more expensive than other options but the price is well worth the quality product you get!",

                "reviewText": "My first impressions of this product is that it\u2019s of a high quality. I was hesitant to buy the 4 pack of screen plus camera protectors that were about $7 but I am glad I went with this choice instead.To start the packaging looked nice and it came with everything you needed, including the non slip surface to set the phone on.Applying the screens provided to be quite simple so long as you follow the directions.So far the adhesive arms to have worked perfectly and it was actually the best application of a screen protector I have ever done. Once I was finished there was not a single air or dust bubble on the entire screen which I have never been able to achieve before.If you initially get some air pockets after applying the glass do not worry!I did as well, but as the instructions say just gently lift up the sides where the air bubbles are and then slowly work them out with the micro fiber cloth. They will eventually all disappear. I had a couple stubborn ones that it took me about 3-4 times each of gently lifting up the screen with my fingernail until I could see the adhesive uncover the bubble and try again. (Note) I took off the guide at this point to help peel back the screen.The camera protectors application was also a breeze and they seem like they will provide adequate protection while not being too obtrusive.Other than that I think these feel like you\u2019re getting three high quality protectors for half the price of the top brands.If you were on the edge of getting these or some really cheap ones like I was, I highly recommend getting these. I\u2019ll update later on how well they are holding up after a month or two.",

My iPhone 15 Pro Max came in today so I was finally able to put these on. The camera screen protection perfectly aligns with the cameras and was a breeze to put on and I didn't find any air bubbles. However, I did encounter a few tiny air bubbles when putting on the screen protection. Very likely to be user error or user handling of the cover. I'm really nit picky when it comes to air bubbles. I was able to clear them by using a credit card and apply pressure to remove them. I just press against them and move them out to the sides. If you mess up, it's fine. It comes with 3 screen protectors so you can always use another one. The screen protector does appear to be slightly thicker than other tempered glass ones. The black surrounding on the screen protector looks fine even though it may appear that you are losing a bit of screen real estate. Although I don't really see me losing any, it would be nice if it was clear instead for the greater peace of mind.",

                "reviewText": "I just had to make an edit: I replaced this screen protector with another one for testing, and I was playing around with it before throwing it away. I can honestly say this is the strongest glass screen protector I've ever handled. It's basically plastic in how much it can bend and withstand, but it is made of glass, and feels like it. I eventually got it to shatter, but it took so much more punishment than I thought possible.This screen protector is advertised as more tempered and stronger than the other ESR glass screen protector, and since I\u2019ve been using it, it hasn\u2019t cracked. Still, the durability remains to be seen. The screen protector is super clear, super smooth, and super easy to install. The alignment bracket is perfectly fitted and helps the installation tremendously. The packaging is top notch as well, and the fact that it comes with 3 screen protectors is a huge bonus.That being said, I got the 15 Pro Max because of the better screen and smaller bezels. ESR continues to make screen protectors with a substantial black bezel around the edges, which cuts into the tiny bezels around the phone. With that, I cannot recommend this screen protector wholeheartedly.I asked support why this was the case, and this was their response: \u201cIn order to get the protector to adhere properly to the entire curved surface, the black border has to be made slightly wider than the actual viewable screen. This ensures complete coverage and prevents issues like preventing issues like lifted edges, not sticking or peeling off.\u201c",

                "reviewText": "I would never use any mobile device without throwing on a case and screen protector from ESR first! I have always liked using ESR screen protectors because they're always so well made, fit perfectly, and come with a handy installation frame to ensure the screen protector is always perfectly aligned. Previous ESR protectors have always been really good quality with just the right thickness and scratch resistance to make them last for YEARS. This latest version of their screen protector is even MORE substantial than previous versions I've used. It feels slightly thicker and now they've included a very fine black border around the perimeter of the protector to make the edge of the protector \"vanish\" into the dark black display of the phone. The protector is sized JUST right so that if you decide to put your phone into a case that the edges of the case will not interfere with the protector. I currently use an ESR Classic Hybrid case and the protector naturally, fits flawlessly with minimal \"gap\" between the edge of the screen protector and the installed case. This fitment holds true with other brands of cases as well so ESR clearly did their homework as far as \"spec'ing\" out the edge clearances. Installation is so easy and one would be hard pressed to screw up because ESR supplies everything to ensure the installation goes smoothly. The Armorite protector comes with not 1 but 2 screen VERY well made screen protectors, the accompanying cleaning and surface prep kit and my favorite, the installation alignment frame! Pretty hard to mess things up especially when they have clearly written instructions and good quality parts that come in the kit.One thing I noticed about this screen protector is its resistance to smudges and fingerprints. I tend to leave a lot of fingerprints on things but strangely this screen protector seems to stay clean a LOT longer than I'd expect. Cleaning is equally a cinch - just wipe with a damp cloth and it looks brand new. no harsh cleaners or sprays needed.100% recommend this product (and other ESR) products. Truly an amazing company with an amazing product.",
