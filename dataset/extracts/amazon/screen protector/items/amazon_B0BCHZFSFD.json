I usually spend 7$ on them and then spend $20 on wipes to apply an oleophobic coating but this glass seems to already have a oleophobic coating. My finger glides over this glass so smooth it\u2019s surprising. Not to mention those cheap screen protectors only last a few days before they chip or crack or get scratched by keys in my pocket. I can\u2019t speak for how long this will last without breaking but I can definitely tell it\u2019s built different than the ones I used to buy. It\u2019s pricey but seems worth it.",

Within 3 days, phone (gently) dropped once on its protected side and already cracked. I\u2019m glad they come in packs of three. I try to keep one extra box in stock because one day, there will just be a crack with no explanation. I have never tried to follow up with the \u201clifetime warranty\u201d but I might this time. This is an expensive \u201csupply\u201d to keep the phone in pristine condition, which mine always are at trade-in.",

The fitting frame is a great idea and immensely helpful to align the protector. I always fear for trapped air bubbles when fitting screen protectors , and, although I got a few initial as the protector settled onto the phone screen, they were easy to squeeze out and remove. Finger interaction and screen response with them fitted is great. Very smooth and seamless. Would recommend. Have used them along with a Spigen case to help protect my iPhone 14 Pro Max.
