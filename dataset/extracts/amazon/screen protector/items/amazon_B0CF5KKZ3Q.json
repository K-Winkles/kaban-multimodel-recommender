                "reviewText": "The only reason I gave it more than 1 star is because it is a very well designed kit. Super easy to install and can\u2019t even tell it\u2019s there. That being said\u2026. The \u201cprivacy\u201d part is nearly useless. The phones brightness needs to be down 50% or more for the person next to you to actually not be able to see the screen. Sure, it dims the screen a bit. But at full brightness everything on screen is still completely visible and even text messages are entirely legible. That was my whole purpose of buying this, so someone sitting next to me couldn\u2019t see my screen.As far as a protector goes, good quality. As far as a privacy protector goes, do NOT recommend.UPDATE: less than one week in, the first screen protector has cracked in several places. Look at the picture, you can see how bad it is. To put this in perspective, I\u2019ve had an iPhone since the 4g came out well over a decade ago. I\u2019ve never broken an iPhone screen except on my 4g (fell 40 feet from the top of bleachers. Nothing would save that lol). I\u2019ve also never used screen protectors before. So well over a decade with zero broken screens with zero screen protection, yet this screen protector cracked in several places with less than one week of use? 100% not worth it. Do not waste your money on a \u201cprivacy\u201d screen protector that doesn\u2019t actually protect your privacy, and will crack with the slightest little bump. What\u2019s the point of a screen protector that\u2019s weaker than the screen it\u2019s protecting? Or what\u2019s the point of a \u201cprivacy\u201d screen protector that allows far more visibility than it lets on in the ad? Theres a reason this thing is super cheap and comes with 4 in the pack. You\u2019re gonna break it and need another in short order, and it\u2019s not going to do what it says it does.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.",

I don't have anything to hide but I like to get what I pay for. The screen is still visible at a 45 degree angle. I had to lower the brightness of the screen to get the effect I was after. In doing so, the screen is....well darker and harder to see when looking straight at it which is not optimal. Anywho, I'm going to eventually drop the phone, so I'll be back with a review after that happens....maybe...",

                "reviewText": "This screen protector saved my phone on the second day I had it installed. On vacation, it slipped out of my grip and fell hard face down onto an aggregate driveway. The screen protector sustained four chips along the edge and then cracked inward. I didn\u2019t have a replacement with me but it held up great over the next three days. Once home I removed the damaged screen protector and saw that the phone sustained no damage! Installed a new protector this morning and I\u2019m good to go.I would 100% highly recommend this kit! The alignment frames make installing the glass easy and foolproof.The protectors are glare free and smooth as silk, especially when using the slide keyboard.As far as value, this is the way to go. Four protectors with lens wipes, drying cloths, lint stickers and the alignment frames, which are reusable if needed make this the only way to go for protecting an expensive phone.Buy this kit!",
