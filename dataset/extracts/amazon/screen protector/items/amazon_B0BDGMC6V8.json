You can see from the photo that the glass does not quite match the watch face, it is about 1/2 mm narrower. But I\u2019m not complaining about that.The real problem is that it interferes with touch. I was nearly unable to enter passcode to unlock Watch. It is odd because you can see that the watch detects your finger but it won\u2019t complete the action, e.g. a button will animate but not activate. If you press long and firmly you can get them to work but normal touch is very often rejected. I think the glass is too thick so the amount of touch the Watch detects does not cross threshold and is rejected as inadvertent. If you type on keyboard you will see some letters are taken, some not, some appear briefly but then are removed. Sounds like maybe a watch bug but when I removed screen protector everything works perfectly all the time. And it worked perfectly before I installed the protector.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not sure how long this will last, but the product looks good for the most part. The issue is getting it lined up perfectly. If you try to lift it up again to realign it bubbles form around the edges that won't go away. It's a frustrating process. Also, the instructions included were for a phone and don't match up with the watch. There were guide stickers in the box, but there was no instruction on how to use them. Also the first protector I tried to use, the film on it would not come off. So it was unusable. Luckily on the 2nd one the film came right off. Not sure about the 3rd one as I haven't attempted to use it yet. If the bubbles on the edges continue to annoy me I may try the 3rd one. But honestly, I'll probably try to find one with a guide to assist with the install. I know the Apple Watch Ultra just came out, but this seemed like a rushed product without the proper install instructions or guide.",
