                "reviewText": "I got this screen protector after getting tired of the crappy plastic grime-magnet screen cover that comes with the Otterbox Defender case. (I will ONLY use Otterbox Defender cases for my iPhone... I sell cars and I\u2019m always taking my phone in and out of my pocket when I\u2019m on the lot or in the shop and I drop my phone A LOT on cement and blacktop and Otterbox cases have been the ONLY thing that protects my phones that I\u2019ve had over the last ten years.) So I replaced the crappy screen protector that comes with the Otterbox Defender case with this screen protector. Easy to install. Had it on my phone - no bubbles like the film style protectors, no issues, no problems. Clean look, beautiful... just like how an iPhone looks without a screen protector on it. Touch response on the screen was excellent, just like an iPhone without a protector. Then one day three weeks ago, I dropped my phone in the shop, but this time, it landed on some uneven concrete near the alignment bay... basically if you can envision a small rock sized bit of concrete jutting up from the ground, and my phone falling screen down centered right on top of it, you\u2019ll know there was nothing my Otterbox case could do - the concrete mini-mountain jammed into my screen. I was PISSED. The way it looked, I figured my screen was broken underneath the screen protector, so I waited to take the screen protector off - until today. I looked closer at my phone and saw that the \u201clines\u201d spidering out from where the rock had hit the screen protector didn\u2019t actually continue along the millimeter of bare phone screen between the edges of the Otterbox and the JetTech screen protector. I thought, \u201cWoah what? Could it be?\u201d So I gently pried the screen protector off (used my fingernail to gently pull it up, and no stickiness or residue on the phone screen by the way) - and I kid you not: MY PHONE SCREEN WAS PERFECTLY INTACT!!! After my initial shock wore off within a couple minutes, I immediately used my perfectly protected phone to hop on here to write this review. (And I rarely ever write reviews.) Spending $5-6 on this screen protector saved me from spending another $800-1000 on a new phone. And I still have the second screen protector it came with since it\u2019s a two pack. You can guess what I\u2019ll be putting on my phone\u2019s screen right away after I\u2019m done writing this review. ;) THANK YOU JETTECH!!! BEST SCREEN PROTECTOR IN THE WORLD!!!",

This tempered glass film comes in a convenient 2-pack, providing an extra layer of defense for your iPhone's display.One of the notable advantages of the JETech Screen Protector is its durability. Made from high-quality tempered glass, it provides a strong and resilient barrier against everyday wear and tear. The protector effectively safeguards the screen from scratches caused by keys, coins, or other sharp objects that may come into contact with your device in your pocket or bag.The installation process of the screen protector is relatively straightforward. The package includes all the necessary tools, such as a cleaning cloth and dust removal sticker, to ensure a smooth and bubble-free application. The precise cutouts and perfect fit for the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 7 Plus screens make it easy to align the protector accurately.The clarity of the JETech Screen Protector is another positive aspect. With its high-transparency design, the protector allows for clear and crisp viewing of the device's screen, ensuring that there is no compromise on image quality or touch sensitivity. The oleophobic coating helps repel fingerprints and smudges, keeping the screen clean and free from distracting marks.While the JETech Screen Protector offers reliable protection, there are a few considerations to keep in mind. Some users may find that the screen protector is slightly thicker than expected, which can affect the tactile experience during touchscreen interactions. Additionally, the screen protector may not cover the entire front surface of the iPhone, leaving a small gap around the edges.Overall, the JETech Screen Protector for iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 7 Plus provides a dependable shield for your device's screen. With its durable tempered glass construction, easy installation process, and clear visibility, it effectively safeguards against scratches and fingerprints. While it may not be the thinnest option available, it offers a satisfactory level of protection for everyday use. Consider investing in this 2-pack to ensure your iPhone's screen stays in optimal condition.",
