Smoothed the surface nicely on a used screen, and should provide some protection. After seeing two phones saved by these in a week, I was only too happy to get them a cheap insurance.Like most, these are very sensitive to dust on the screen during installation. I was working near an a/c vent and found the screen would quickly accumulate dust that prevented the protector from bonding evenly. It did come with good dust removal stickers. And the alignment tool was very nice to have.",

Now that my wife upgraded her iPhone it was time to get some new screen protectors for her and this is my natural choice. I like these because they are easy to install (come with a nice plastic guide) and it is also easy to lift a corner if you have to remove any dust. They lay down flat without a lot of air pockets and the edges also seal up nicely. All-in-all, they install easily and look great and they are strong enough. My wife hasn't broken any of them but my daughter does go thru them at an alarming clip, yet her phone screen always emerges unscathed. Amazing! (both her ability to drop her phone and the Supershieldz's ability to protect it)",

These are a little thicker than many screen protectors I've tried and they work well.I just recently bought these for mine and my wife's iphone 13's. This time they came with a white plastic guide to lay on the phone when putting the screen protector on. This seemed really good in theory, but I had problems with it. It didnt lay on my phone very well and when trying to put on the screen protector, the plastic guide was actually preventing the screen protector from laying fully down on the phone. I eventually gave up onthe plastic guide and just did it the way I've always done it without a guide.",
