First I watched the video - a short video twice - and followed the instructions from the kit enclosed and install went so smoothly - got it exact to fit. Perfection. No need to go to the cell phone stores to purchase what they have available - which is so costly and breaks within days - (cracks) This product has been shattered proof - no cracks and I have even dropped the cell phone about 4 feet and no damage whatsoever to the tempered glass nor to the phone. I can not emphasize enough what a great cell phone tempered glass protector this product is.IMHO the best on the market and so inexpensive. Thank you for this extremely well made products.",

                "reviewText": "I used this product on the iphone 6s. Given the problems I list below, the company sent me a new package of 2 screens without asking for the old screens to be returned. I think that the device they use to center the screen on the phone needs improvement. The company seems eager for review and sincerely want to improve their product. The actual glass itself is superb. I would say that the screen protector is a little bit large for the curved edge of the iphone screen and doesn't have total adhesion on the edges. When I installed the screen protector the first time, I was glad there were two screen protectors in the box. When I tried to get a piece of dust out from under the screen on the first one I attempted to install, the whole screen peeled off when I just tried to get one corner up and then when I tried to re-install it, I couldn\u2019t get the guide thingie to hold it straight enough so it was all crooked. so that one was done. On the second screen, despite all my precautions, and the fact that there were no dust particles on the phone, but somehow when I peeled the backing off of the protector there was dust stuck on the protector. I don\u2019t know how it got there but somehow my screen is pretty much mostly attached except of course the edges where the screen curves around the edges. It pretty much looks pretty good. But not as good as my Zagg screen protector was. We will see how long this will last compared to the Zagg screen protector. When I went to the website I couldn\u2019t find anything about how to deal with the issue or send for a refund or replacement or anything. All it said that the only way you could get any refund or replacement was if it were within 30 days of purchase which I\u2019m not sure when I purchased mine.For my other phone, I used the GlasstR Easy Fit screen protector in which the device to center it over the phone was much better and the screen protector had a layer of film over the top of it in addition to the to the film over the application surface that made it really nice and when it was all done I just peeled that off. The screen protector also flowed nicely over the screen without leaving any bubbles at all. I emailed the company and told them about the above issues and they immediately sent out a new box of 2 screen protectors and the application went much better and I have no bubbles and not a speck of dust uinder the screen protector. It has worked flawlessly since then. I just wish the screen protector was a little bit smaller so that the edges would be firmly attached. We'll see how it works over the long haul.",

                "reviewText": "After reading reviews for various screen protectors on this site and others, I decided to try this brand for my second generation iPhone SE. (My previous iPhone had slipped out of my pocket onto the ground once, and while it didn't shatter, it did get several unsightly divots in the screen.) This screen protector was easy to apply and fit perfectly! As others have noted, I did have to watch the instruction video a couple times to make sure I had everything positioned properly, but once you do, the process is pretty foolproof. You just need to make sure the phone is as dust-free as possible before you start and this product gives you all the supplies you need to do that. Once you have applied it, you will need to remove the remaining air bubbles (some initial air bubbles are going to be inevitable with any screen protector) but if you use the technique shown in the video and work from the inside out using your nails and the included microfiber cloth, it is possible to remove them without too much trouble. The finished application looks great and doesn't interfere with my phone case, and I haven't noticed any loss of sensitivity in the touch screen. I also like that the kit includes two of everything for a very reasonable price. This is an excellent product!",

I read the instructions, watched the Youtube video, did 1 rehearsal procedure. The screen protector went on perfectly with no bubbles or visible dust. If you see a speck of dust, lift up protector and use the sticky dust remover tab provided. The guide they provided fits perfectly over the phone for centering the protector. The iPhone looks NEW again and we have peace of mind that it\u2019s protected. Highly recommend this.",

I will reorder this when the 2nd one runs out.",
