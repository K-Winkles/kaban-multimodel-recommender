I put the two guide stickers on each side to hold the screen protector in place and then proceeded to remove the layer under the top half while smoothing it out. Then I lifted the bottom and used the sticker on the screen for any dust residue and repeated what I did at the top. No lines, no trapped dust, and definitely no bubbles. It does darken the screen quite a bit but that's why we got 2600 nits, am I right? \ud83d\ude09 Also the fingerprint reader will need a little time to be as fast as before but it works okay now.",

                "reviewText": "I just upgraded from my S22 to a S24 and I wanted to protect my investment. These were easy to apply and didn't take too much effort to get the air bubbles out like some other brands. Fingerprint reader still works well. Definitely something that should be done for all phones to protect from key scratches etc. I've learned my lessons :)",

What I don\u2019t like about them is how dark these are so I have to increase my phone brightness. Also u have to look straight to see the screen. Can\u2019t see anything if you are looking from an angle so good privacy but not too good if you are driving and using gps and you can\u2019t see directions if the phone is angled.",
