                "reviewText": "Over time, the protective glass screen protector on my iPhone 11 had become cracked and chipped on some of the edges. I delayed replacing it as I thought the action of accomplishing the replacement would be difficult. The very clear instructions were easy to follow and the entire process was totally \"painless\" and easily performed by an 81 year old who is not terribly proficient at such things. The new screen protector works as advertised with no difference noted in performance with the original.\ud83d\ude09",

                "reviewText": "This screen protector is very clear. It is rigid, so if the iPhone is dropped the screen protector may crack. That\u2019s much better than the iPhone screen cracking. I speak from experience as I had to replace my first two screen protectors (2 screen protectors come in a package).Be very careful in preparing the iPhone screen for installing the screen protector. Use the supplied wet wipe and lint free cloth to clean the iPhone screen. Then use the dust absorbed \u201csticky\u201d wipe to clean the dust specs from the screen, followed by the dust pick up strip. The install kit has a plastic frame that supposedly aids in aligning the screen. That frame is too large for an iPhone 11 Pro. Thus, for me it is useless.Also, the screen is just a little too long. Without a case, I didn\u2019t notice this. I achieved a 100% adhesion of the screen protector to the screen. I use a flexible clear case marketed by Torres (Amazon purchase also). When I squeeze my iPhone into that case the slight overhang of the protector is \u201clifted\u201d a little. I can see the air gap at the top of the screen. The gap is not on the illuminated part of the screen. I only see the lift when the iPhone is turned off. I can live with that.",

I\u2019ve previously used the JETech screen protectors (iPhone 11) and they ALWAYS crack extremely easily so I\u2019ve decided to try something new. My screen already seems much more receptive to touch with this new screen protector compared to the JETech one. Super easy application too, no bubbles or lifting around the edges, and took about 45 seconds!",
