The screen protector went on with only two bubbles, which were easily removed. The price was great for the value. I like that it includes two screen protectors. The only issues I had were with the cleaning wipe having a very noxious chemical smell that made me a little dizzy and that the second bubble was not able to be removed with the included squeegee. I had to use the credit card trick where you lift the edge of the screen protector with the card and then push the bubble out by rubbing the screen protector behind it and then put the screen protector back down on the edge. That did the job though and it is perfectly on my screen now with zero bubbles. The clarity of the screen protector is very good. Images look sharper than they did with my previous screen protector from another brand. I\u2019m satisfied with it overall.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve gone through several different glass screen protectors over the years. I usually pay extra to geek squad at best buy to install my glass screen protectors bc I\u2019m always afraid of screwing it up and having to buy another set. This one by far has been the easiest most straightforward screen protector to install! I\u2019ll be using spigen for all my future devices! It was easy to follow instructions and easy to clear out air bubbles, idk why I can never get all air bubbles out on previous ones I\u2019ve tried! Finally a common sense company product! Loved that it also came with an extra in case you mess up, idk how you could mess up installation but it felt good opening the package knowing there was a \u201cgrace\u201d round installation :) The installation tray was awesome it perfectly aligned the glass. After a couple weeks of use, I also love that fingerprints nor smudges stay on the glass; it feels like the glass that\u2019s actually on the iPhone itself, the glass feels nice to the touch. Inevitability my toddler has gotten ahold of my phone and dropped it a few times so it\u2019s seen a few unintentional toddler tests lol :/ So far no cracks! Impressive as my little one is a rough kiddo. I\u2019ve paired the glass screen protector with the spigen clear case, spigen camera lense protectors and the clear magnetic pop socket\u2026idk I\u2019ve been enamored by the clear aesthetics and loving the setup! I never do reviews but had to give a shout-out to this great product! It\u2019s hard to find a good product that actually does what is advertised and this is one of the few.",
