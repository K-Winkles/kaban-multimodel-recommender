This time around I decided to try an antireflective protector because I use my phone outside much of the time. Fortunately, I've never broken my phone glass.This glass is perfectly cut for my phone and comes with a temporary snap-on guide to help you place the glass in perfect alignment with the sides of the phone. It's the first time I've seen this feature and I love it. I also love the texture of the glass, it has a very appealing soft feel that looks great too. It cost a little more but between the high quality coating and the plastic guide, it's worth a few bucks more.",

The matte finish not only provides a unique touch but also minimizes glare effectively. The tempered glass construction enhances its durability, ensuring long-lasting protection for my screen.

Coming from a matte plastic screen protector on my work tablet, I was looking for something similar for my iphone, and the fact that this delivers the same matte feel and look while being tempered glass is so good. Clarity is not affected to be honest, but the feel you get in your fingers is top notch, gliding feels super smooth, and fingerprints don\u2019t show, unless you have greasy fingers. Glare is reduced as well, making it easier on my eyes. We\u2019ll see about durability, but so far so good.Installation was super easy with the included guide, dust stickers and wipes.",

Reduces glare, robust, super silky feeling when using my phone now. It\u2019s like a million percent upgrade from my prior screen.Lessons learned from install. Clean per the instructions. Put the plastic mount thing on the phone, then put the glass down onto using the plastic thing as a guide.

                "reviewText": "I don\u2019t write reviews often, but I was thinking about how much I enjoyed using this screen protector that I just had to write one. I wanna start off by saying ITS NOT FOR EVERYONE! You\u2019ll either love it or hate it. I love the feel I get when I type or scroll, it\u2019s refreshing to have some sort of feedback instead of just glass. I also love reading on my phone now, it feels more like a kindle in a way. The protector also does a good job with the anti glare.However, there are a few trade offs you\u2019ll have to accept to enjoy it. If you use your phone with a high brightness level, you might notice the loss in resolution more and notice things like a rainbow effect. This is especially noticeable on white colors, they look as if the screen were greasy and show pixels. I\u2019ve gotten used to it and have my phone on dark mode, low brightness, so it\u2019s not as noticeable. I\u2019ve only had it for a few weeks, and it still looks brand new. I expect with time, the finish may wear off or scratch, but only time will tell. Also they don\u2019t include a installation tray to get the protector perfectly on the screen.",
