Cloth, cleaner, lint removal stickers and alignment stickers are included. A great value, you get two shields and install tools. The shield fits perfectly around cameras and edges. It is just a tiny bit short of the edge of the phone. Once back in my Otter Box case, this is not a problem and the phone and screen is protected.",

The directions are clear and easy to follow and everything you need to install the protector correctly is included the package. In at least one instance having the protector installed saved my phone's touchscreen from damage after dropping it directly on a rock.",

                "reviewText": "I'll start by saying I only gave these 4 stars because they are always a bit too small for the screen. They are thick, smooth and hold up very well even when dropped. My only complaint is even with buying the correct size to fit the phone, they are always a bit too small and don't reach the edges of the glass. They are very easy to apply if you follow the directions and if there is a bubble or 2 just use a credit card wrapped in the cloth that comes with the package and move the bubble right off the edge for a pefect looking screen protector. Will continue to buy but truly wish the company would be more precise on sizing.",

Easy to adhere, stays adhered, but isn't so adhesive that I can't pop the protector off after succumbing my phone to a free fall. The attached photos are of the screen protector I just replaced after my phone face planted into the driveway when I opened my car door. The screen itself is unscathed and still works like a dream.What I like about these so much is that, even though I've clearly cracked this all over the place, when I removed the protector from my device it didn't splinter off into chunks. The back adhesive is holding it all in one piece.",

                "reviewText": "I've used this brand with other models so stuck with it. I got a Galaxy A14 in another country that has no 5G but this seems to have the same spec for both the A14 for both 5G and non-5G phones. I gave it 4 of 5 stars for \"easy to install\" because there has to be easier ways to install but this one works fairly well.Because you use stickers (like adding hinges to door so it closes properly) to position the glass before you install it permanently, it allows you to prep easily. You clean with the cloth, then I use the dust collector and then finish with the alcohol wipe (all included, one set for each glass in the kit.) Then flip the glass shield with the sticker hinges and it starts to stick to the phone.The first two times I got dust or something so had gaps that would not go away. So, with the sticker hinges still attached, I removed the glass and cleaned the phone again using the same cloth, duster and alcohol wipe I used before. The third time flipped the glass shield unto the phone and it did a complete bond. Amazing to watch.The written instructions are very incomplete. I probably used their link with my previous phones so I knew what to do.",
