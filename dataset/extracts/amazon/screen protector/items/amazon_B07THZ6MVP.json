But I was really impressed by this company when I had a question. The responses were fast and very helpful. Will always buy from them in the future!As for the product. It\u2019s a screen protector. There\u2019s many companies with them. It does what the others do. It\u2019s clear and it sticks to your screen. I gave durability 4 stars because it\u2019s a plain piece of glass it will break. Is it easy to apply? Also a 4 because any screen protector is a pain to apply without getting dust in there.",
