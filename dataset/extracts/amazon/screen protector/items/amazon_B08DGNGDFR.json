The plastic flexibility is the exact reason why we call it tempered glass screen protector. Tempered glass is a type of safety glass that is stronger than ordinary glass. 2. It cannot be seen from the appearance that it is glass or plastic. As a customer, what can we do to identify it? There is an easy, quick, cost-effective way to test it yourself, and it's very accurate. Most plastics have a melting point between 160 and 210 degrees Celsius, and glass materials are at least over 1400 degrees Celsius, so is there a lighter around? 3. Does it come with a cleaning wipe to use prior to placing on the phone? Yes, the package includes: 6*Guide Stickers, 3*Wet Wipe&3*Dry Wipe,3*Dust Absorber. 4. How can I remove bubbles? Use the kit in the package to clean the screen before placing the screen protector. If there are bubbles,try to gently press the bubbles with your finger or with a ruler,but the screen surface needs a thin cloth pad to avoid scratching the protector. 5. How can I remove a cracked glass screen protector? Lift the screen protector with the card from any corner of the screen protector, then hold the corner and remove slowly. (If you find CHIP or CRACK on the screen protector, for your safety, please wear gloves when removing the screen protector.)",

It\u2019s a 3-pack of tempered glass protectors that not only fit my budget but also deliver top-tier defense for my phone.Installing these screen protectors was a breeze, thanks to the included installation kit. They seamlessly fit with my phone case, leaving no gaps or bubbles around the edges. The touch sensitivity remains excellent, ensuring no disruption to my usual phone usage.What truly impresses me is their durability. I\u2019ve encountered a couple of accidental drops, and these protectors have shielded my phone impeccably. The sturdy tempered glass feels reliable and has saved my screen from scratches and cracks.The pack of three offers incredible value for the price. It provides peace of mind knowing I have spares in case of damage, following the positive experiences shared by others who have found these protectors to be long-lasting, enduring regular drops without causing harm to their phone screens for several months.These screen protectors have been my go-to brand since my iPhone 8 for good reason. They've consistently shielded my phone from drops, chips, and cracks, ensuring that even in extreme circumstances, like dropping the phone into an asphalt-filled pothole, the protector took the hit, sparing my actual phone screen completely.In summary, the Ailun Glass Screen Protector is an exceptional purchase. It\u2019s easy to apply, offers reliable protection, and comes at a reasonable price. I highly recommend it to anyone aiming to keep their iPhone screen safe and scratch-free.",

                "reviewText": "The iPhone 12 Mini is undeniably a sleek and compact device, but its smaller size can make it vulnerable to accidental drops or scratches. To ensure its longevity and maintain its flawless display, I decided to invest in a glass screen protector specifically designed for the iPhone 12 Mini. After extensive research, I discovered a fantastic option that has significantly exceeded my expectations.The glass screen protector I opted for is simply remarkable. The installation process was a breeze, thanks to the included alignment tool, ensuring a perfect fit and preventing any bubbles from forming underneath. The protector flawlessly adhered to my iPhone 12 Mini's screen without any unsightly edges, providing maximum coverage and unbeatable protection.One of the main reasons I selected this particular protector was its high transparency. Unlike many others on the market, this screen protector does not compromise the vibrant display quality of my device. With its ultra-thin design and exceptional clarity, it feels like having a naked screen while enjoying the added peace of mind it offers.In terms of durability, this glass screen protector has been nothing short of exceptional. It has effectively withstood the daily wear and tear, providing excellent resistance against scratches, scuffs, and unnecessary damage. Despite its slim profile, it manages to offer impressive impact resistance, safeguarding my device against accidental drops and impacts.One feature that particularly impressed me was its compatibility with most phone cases. I had no trouble fitting my existing case over the screen protector, ensuring comprehensive protection for both the back and front of my iPhone 12 Mini. This compatibility ensures that I can use my preferred case without compromising the safety of my screen.To sum it up, the glass screen protector for the iPhone 12 Mini has been an outstanding investment. Its perfect fit, exceptional clarity, and durability make it an excellent companion for my device. With superior protection against scratches and daily hazards, I feel confident that my iPhone 12 Mini is in safe hands. I highly recommend this screen protector to anyone looking to enhance the longevity of their iPhone 12 Mini's display without sacrificing quality or aesthetics.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these back in early 2021 and just put on the last of the three today (11/28/22). It works great on my iPhone 12 and were I to be using a case that wraps completely around the edge, I have no doubts that this would work well with it. BUT, I'm not using one of those cases because this is for a work phone that sits on a desk all the time, so the case doesn't need to be so tough.The first one lasted almost a year and the second one about five months (the one I just replaced)...never had any problems with the screen scratching or lifting off the phone. Fingerprints are a minor issue (I just wipe the screen off on my jeans or use some rubbing alcohol on a paper towel) and the glare isn't so bad (or at least, I was never bothered by it). The previous screen protectors bit the dust after a couple of fumbles, both onto concrete I believe, and cracked with some spider webbing, but there were no angry shards of glass flying everywhere and the rest of the screen held on just fine and operated well until I peeled it off. The phone screen has been pristine each time, not even a scratch. Even after peeling it off, it still held together in once piece, and when I tentatively tried to snap it by gently flexing back and forth, it was still pretty solid.I never did crack into the wet wipes, so I don't know if they were any good when I got them. The most useful parts were the \"dust-absorbers\" aka the sticker tabs. Those are the BEST to have for this kind of thing. The little scrap of dust cloth was useful too. I'll end up transferring my extra stuff to my new box of protectors for next time--no sense getting rid of them when I know I'll need them again! I don't remember if it came with instructions--this isn't my first rodeo, so I might have tossed them.It was easy to put on and applies like any other protector--you clean the phone really well, check for dust, start peeling the back off the screen protector, and position the top at the top, pull off the backing all the way, and hope for the best. Mine adhered no problem--in fact, the only problem that I've ever had was when a dust spec snuck in there and messed things up on previous ones. Sometimes you can go in and lift up the protector and clean that again, but often times you just have to live with it. You smooth it out a little with your fingers and it should suck down onto the phone on its own; you might have to use a credit card to smooth out any air bubbles, but as long as you cleaned the screen enough, the effort should be minimal.TLDR: Durable, affordable, comes with helpful applicator stuff. If you can handle putting on any old screen protector with or without instructions, you'll be able to do this one as well.",
