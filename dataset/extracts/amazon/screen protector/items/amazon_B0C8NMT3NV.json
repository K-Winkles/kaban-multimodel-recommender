Second one went on just fine so I think the first one was defective, however the screen cracked within 2 days. I have had cheaper screen protectors I have dropped on asphalt from a high distance that didn\u2019t crack at all. My daughter bumped my phone onto my carpeted floor from the couch so we\u2019re talking maybe 2 feet drop and instantly cracked. I am extremely disappointed with this product and will have to order new set already because of the poor quality of this product. Save your money!",

                "reviewText": "I love the screen protector. The two things I would mention however is that in the video on Tik Tok, it\u2019s shown that you can place anytime and will remove all dust/debris. It\u2019s not the case. You do have to clean your phone with the wipe it offers to make sure all smudges and debris are fully gone. On my first one which was the clear(I got it by accident), it left some tiny debris on the bottom of the protector. The second time I ordered one which is the privacy protector, I cleaned it as perfect as I could and even used a computer duster canister to make sure it was clean. The installation came out perfect and fast. The second thing I\u2019d say sucks is that it does smudges even after having it place, not too bad but they make it seem like it will never smudge. I\u2019m still happy with it for the the price it was which was $27.",
