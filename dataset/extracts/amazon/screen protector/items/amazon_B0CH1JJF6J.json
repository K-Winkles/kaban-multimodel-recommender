I agree that the wet & dry wipes are super small but, not a problem. My screen went on so smooth, no bubbles at all. Super satisfied.",

When installing it I accidentally got a hair on the sticky part and it was super easy to remove and did not completely ruin the screen protector, as can occur with some of the other brands. Since then, I\u2019ve dropped my phone a couple for times and have no damage to my phone or the screen protector. These are definitely going to be my go-to! :)",

I will say if you put it on correctly & don\u2019t touch the sticky side AT ALL it works great! You get 3 of them. And the price is so cheap! It\u2019s not real thick but I didn\u2019t care because my reason for purchasing was to hold it together so it wouldn\u2019t get worse. So it worked for me. If you\u2019re looking for a screen to protect your phone from cracking you might want a thicker one.",

I had this protector on my screen so I figured it\u2019d be fine when once I took the protector off, the crack went right through it and my screen is cracked bad. Like I said, it fell off a normal chair, not aggressively, and it couldn\u2019t even protect from that. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP. You will just be paying way more to fix your actual screen later!!",
