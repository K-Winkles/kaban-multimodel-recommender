The screen protector lasts for an extremely long time and it takes many drop before if actually begins to start cracking. It does an incredible job and making sure my phone itself doesn\u2019t crack and there are barely any air bubbles! It fits perfectly every time and it doesn\u2019t change the effect that the phone itself has. The best part is the grey and black placing pieces that it comes with to help you please the protector evenly onto your phone which makes it easy to install. The touch screen is still as amazing too! I\u2019ll always buy my protectors from here. I give it 4.9 stars out of 5!",

A little more difficult to get the air bubbles out than with previous products that I've purchased from Amfilm as there is no protective film on the top side of glass out of the package to allow the use of a card to massage out the air bubbles. That being said, It still worked out fine and looks good. There is a bigger gap between the edge of the glass and the edge of the phone than I was expecting but not a big deal. I am happy with the product so far. I would recommend it.",
