                "reviewText": "Arrived promptly and intact. They are for Galaxy S21 5G. As others have said, they are slightly smaller than the screen, but I have never had one that was exact. My phone case covers any difference, so that is not an issue. Assuming everyone has put a screen protector on, it is super easy to do and takes seconds after set-up. Clean the glass, put on the protector and you're done; there's nothing complicated about it.The fingerprint reader works through it, but as others, it's not perfect so you might have to press a little harder than you normally would. No big deal, it's not like Andy Griffith had to deal with; a two piece phone and a couple of cords attached to it, not to mention a wall. It's not inconvenient, just push on it and it will get there.I'm not sure you can tell what you're getting, so I can just leave you with that they work and there are 3 of them (there are 2 in the photo because I used one). With my use, they should last a year or two collectively, if not for the life of the phone while I own it. I usually break one within days of putting it on, then I leave it that way for 4 months or whatever, so in theory, they could last forever!",

                "reviewText": "I was reluctant to use tempered glass for my S22 Plus with many reviews stating that the fingerprint scanner won't work after installation. Installation foe this was simple, the same as all tempered glass. Make sure to clean it, and use the dust tape piece to remove any visible dust, particles, hair, etc. Fitment was good, and right after installation I tried using the fingerprint and it still worked (like someone else mentioned, you press down a little bit harder). So I ended up following the instructions, deleting my old fingerprints and redoing them. Also, remember to turn on Touch Sensitivy for screen protectors in your Settings. The touch screen and fingerprint both work perfectly now. Just remember to follow instructions, re-register your fingerprints, and turn on Touch Sensitivity! Highly recommend!",

                "reviewText": "The screen protector itself is great so far. It fit perfect on my phone but I'm giving it 4 stars because first there was no instructions in English included. For someone who hasn't put on a screen protector before it could be confusing. Secondly, the wet and dry wipes that are included were horrible. After using the wet wipe on my screen, I used the dry wipe and it kept smudging all over my screen. I eventually had to use a different wipe just to get all the smudges off. Other than those 2 issues, its a good product.",

This was within my budget, easy to apply (it practically applied itself), and is just so dang pretty in how you don't even see it. This is a solid, economical choice that made my life better and hopefully will enhance yours as well.",

Had my first big drop a couple days ago, with my phone falling 3 feet or so onto gravel, facedown. The screen protector had a chip, and cracks stemming from that, but the screen underneath was unscathed. I attempted to attach the 2nd screen protector in the package but it didnt work quite right, so I used the third one, and was a little more careful this time. Good as new. I see they are less than half what I paid initially so I have ordered another pack, in case I need them again. It was kind of tricky finding a screen protector for my Samsung S21 fe 5g, but this one fits perfect and works very well.",
