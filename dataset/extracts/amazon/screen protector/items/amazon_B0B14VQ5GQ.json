I haven\u2019t hit it on anything so I\u2019m assuming by feel that it is pretty protective. It will definitely protect from any scratches on the screen. However the added protection slightly dulls the touch screen sensitivity and makes the Crown button a little harder to spin compared to how it feels without the case \ud83d\ude124 stars because protection is the main point.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I love the carbon fiber face. It\u2019s scott a clear glass front to it. It is finger sensitive perfectly.And it covers all of the color of my watch so I can wear it every day with my military style or I can pop it off and put on my gold band and wear it with a dress suit but usually what I do is in the two pictures, my left arm I have a real watch on Because I\u2019m watch guy. On the other arm, I have my life in it I may look display the American flag on top and I point the watch underneath it and it just looks like I\u2019m wearing one watch and an American flag displayed on my other wrist so I can wear both , the advantages of that is I can go out with my cool watch collection and still wear it and on my right hand my watch will remind me to drink water to pee to take my medicine and you would think I mean how much could that ? It is a total of eight alarms a day. I turn it to silent so it just buzzes my arm. Let me know it\u2019s time to take care of a part of me. I am paralyzed. I was in the Marine Corps and they took care of my back for me Being paralyzed it doesn\u2019t mean that we have to stop our lives. You can enjoy your collection while having a cellular I watch on your other arm I don\u2019t carry your phone I get all of my email on my watch. I get all of my text messages on my watch and phone calls , I do not carry a phone anymore since I\u2019m not running a business anymore after 35 years I don\u2019t need to do long drawn out text messages. I have a Amazon only phone it\u2019s an older phone but it gets the job done. There\u2019s no financial information on it And I just use it for Amazon. Occasional search but I can do that with Siri on my other arm. My watch is amazing so when they ask you do you want the cellular version you say yes it is the version that does not require that you carry your iPhone with you Doesn\u2019t matter what you do series 567 and eight I believe if it\u2019s all of them from 45 mm up in sizes so make sure you put in the correct size and the correct watch that you have and you\u2019ll end up with this badass watch . It looks like it\u2019s ready for a mud run. It\u2019s ready for a quick swim in the pool while wearing my waterproof earplugs wireless things have changed over the years and it\u2019s time to take advantage of them especially if you\u2019re older, I can download everything to my computer if I need to, I also have an iPad tablet. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody who doesn\u2019t own a tablet and I can make my watch to the tablet. Make phone calls message people anyone who has an iPhone. My tablet also has a cellular chip in it to five 5G connection between my 9 inch tablet and my phone , I\u2019m set I do my Google docs Google sheets and as everything backed up to my Google Drive. Can\u2019t say enough about the beauty of the carbon fiber. It completely changed the look of my watch. I can put any band that I want on it and that\u2019s the most enjoyable part, plus it\u2019s low profile it\u2019s not some big chunky thing on your arm like some of these low profile. I highly recommend it I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever take it off. Lol. Have a great Thanksgiving have a great holiday. I preferred to call it a holiday, a gathering of friends and families to share, food, life, and love.",
