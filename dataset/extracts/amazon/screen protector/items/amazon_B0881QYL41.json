It completely reduces glare, and doesn\u2019t impact the performance of the phone screen at all. It fir perfectly as well! I actually recently shattered it (I accidentally hit my phone screen with the handle of my knife\u2026), and it completely protected my screen! I just ordered a new one. The only \u201cissue\u201d I had was that upon shattering, it didn\u2019t hold together super well, so I had to take a lot of care in removing it, but unless you break it into small pieces you won\u2019t likely have that issue. Couldn\u2019t recommend this more! It\u2019s an absolute steal for the price.",

On top of that, it comes with several adhesive slips to remove specks of dust off the screen before installing.On the phone, it does not interfere with the case. Very smooth surface. Very little sparkle too.The only thing is a very slight bezel that makes the screen look parted on the very edge when looking at it at an angle. 90-degree viewing is perfect.Overall, very good value.",

                "reviewText": "Fully acknowledge that this could be the result of not applying the cover correctly - however, you can see from the photos, it appears that the screen protector isn't wide enough to be flush against both ends of the display screen. Again, that could be my own fault. My biggest complaint is that screen protector seems to be significantly less sensitive compared to non-matte ones. I find myself having to double tap or apply more pressure than normal sometimes. The matte screen itself works well in terms of blocking glare/leaving no fingerprints and protecting the screen itself, but the image quality seems slightly distorted compared to non-matte screens protectors.",

For whatever reason, I have to replace my iPhone screen protectors often and I\u2019ve never had any problems with this brand until the last time I ordered one. It cracked during the application so I contacted Amazon and they were so prompt to replace this item that I had it on my porch for the next morning literally shocked me and it\u2019s very much appreciated that they would replace it so quickly and like I said before, I don\u2019t know why iPhone screen protectors have to be replaced so often. Definitely a con of owning an iPhone in my opinion. When I had android phones, I never had to replace a screen protector! For whatever reason, they seemed to be more sturdy but I like dealing with a company such as Mothca that stand behind their products and replaces it no matter what",
