                "reviewText": "I was very disappointed with this organizer. My flip-flops were the only shoes that would fit in it. Granted I do have large feet, size 10 or 11 but the description said that it could hold men and women shoes. So I assumed my shoes would fit in it.. I couldn't even fit the toe box of the shoe in the slot. I gave it three stars because it does seem to be good quality and small shoes will fit in it. If you have small feet or want it for your children then I think you'll be happy with it. Otherwise find something else.UPDATE: The seller contacted me and was kind enough to give me a full refund, unsolicited. Needless to say I was very impressed. I will be happy to do business with them in the future knowing that if I have a problem I can contact them and expect a fair outcome.",
