                "reviewText": "Update to review:The company sent us new protectors since I\u2019m guessing our previous protectors were maybe faulty. We have had new protectors on for about a week now with no issues. Installation was easy like last time and no issues since then. We did have one protector from the previous package that is still functioning great with no issues, so I\u2019m guessing the other two must have had issues in manufacturing. The company was great to work with and I would totally recommend them and buy from them again.Previous review:We were so excited for an \u201cUnbreakable\u201d screen protector. Got them yesterday and installed last night. By noon today my phone has a huge crack through it! I haven\u2019t dropped it and it has been in my pocket most of the day. My pockets are baggy and not in my back pocket, so didn\u2019t sit on it or anything. So disappointing!We got a pack of 3 screen protectors for 3 new phones. Mine protector broke and another protector didn\u2019t stick around the edges, so only one is still working correctly. Such a bummer. Installing the protector was an easy process, similar to most protectors\u2026 but I did like this process a little better than the cheaper ones we\u2019ve used in the past. Which is why I gave it more stars than only one.",
