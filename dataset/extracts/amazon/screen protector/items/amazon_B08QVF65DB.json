The plastic flexibility is the exact reason why we call it tempered glass screen protector. Tempered glass is a type of safety glass that is stronger than ordinary glass. 2. It cannot be seen from the appearance that it is glass or plastic. As a customer, what can we do to identify it? There is an easy, quick, cost-effective way to test it yourself, and it's very accurate. Most plastics have a melting point between 160 and 210 degrees Celsius, and glass materials are at least over 1400 degrees Celsius, so is there a lighter around? 3. Does it come with a cleaning wipe to use prior to placing on the phone? Yes, the package includes: 4*Guide Stickers, 4*Wet Wipe & 4*Dry Wipe, 2*Dust Absorber 4. How can I remove bubbles? Use the kit in the package to clean the screen before placing the screen protector. If there are bubbles,try to gently press the bubbles with your finger or with a ruler,but the screen surface needs a thin cloth pad to avoid scratching the protector. 5. How can I remove a cracked glass screen protector? Lift the screen protector with the card from any corner of the screen protector, then hold the corner and remove slowly. (If you find CHIP or CRACK on the screen protector, for your safety, please wear gloves when removing the screen protector.)",

Application went mostly flawlessly save for just a couple really tiny bubbles near the edge, but that was my fault once my mistake was corrected to get the glass back on the guide/ form and the bubbles were easily pressed out. I bought a case as well and it wraps around the phone perfectly and sits around the screen protector with an even edge all the way around. I initially applied the camera lens protectors as well and it worked well, but the specific case I got couldn\u2019t work with the camera lens protector on and close the flap of the case it comes with also, which would have offered me double protection, but that\u2019s alright. Great product for the money! And it comes with multiples, so I have extra if I should ever need them.",

                "reviewText": "I always have a pack of screen protectors because I always drop my phone. These screen protectors have never failed me in terms of my actual screen or any part of my phone cracking/breaking. The screen protector itself will crack if you drop it enough, but it does its job and protects the phone. I always buy this specific one. I feel it's slightly easier to put on the phone than some others brands. I'm not 100% sure on that though. But also, I've never had one come off unless I was trying to take it off, and it's also not difficult to take off the phone.",

These are no exception. Fit the iPhone 15 pro max perfectly, comes with the camera protectors and an easy alignment tool to get the perfect alignment. One of my favorite features of this screen protector is that there is no cutouts for cameras or the Dynamic Island so the screen is 100% protected.Great value, highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The glass is pretty good quality, and the guide helps a bunch -- you practically cannot mess up the installation alignment with it. However, dust is a whole different story and depends on your environment I guess. I was able to put it on without any dust getting in the way. However, I noticed that the top right of the protector is not adhering properly, but it is barely noticeable so I am okay with it. Fits very well with my Spigen clear case. The camera protector is a different story. Photography is quite important to me, and I noticed the difference in quality especially in outdoor or angled glares. If you do not mind that, the camera protector fits good and does not take away from the look of the phone; unless you are rocking your phone without a case -- the protector is very thick and makes the camera module look ridiculous in my opinion. Overall, highly recommend these screen protectors!",

The only small issue with them, no matter what you do, there will remain a few small air bubbles. But they never affect the camera.Another advice, if you install it on a brand new iPhone:- The first moment you open the iPhone brand new box, install the camera protector while the phone is still face-down in the box- flip the phone around, get the screen protector ready and handy, get the dust removal sticky take (also included) handy and ready to remove any last-minute dust, hair, lint, dandruff flakes...etc.- Remove the iPhone paper screen protection, and immediately place the bracket on (pay attention to the part that says \"Top\" on the install bracket- Carefully install the screen- Give it about 10 minutes and make sure during that time to squeeze any air bubbles out- Lastly, install the case (if you plan on using one)You are now good!",
