There is no way you can stick the middle, then pull up both ends and expose the adhesive, then stick them back down and NOT introduce any particles. You cannot remove particles from the underside of the sticky film; no way. You are left with bumps and bubbles. I manage 35 phones and have installed many GLASS protectors. This film material is inferior just like the install process. I won't make this mistake twice!",
