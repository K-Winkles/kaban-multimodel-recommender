I did pit the camera lense protector on and second day after installing my phone slipped off my lap and the lense protector cracked! What a time I had removing that cracked protector, the adhesive was on there to stay! I elected not to put a new lense protector back on even though there were extras. The screen protector is great and I know it does its job to protect my screen. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend the screen protector.",

                "reviewText": "I had never bought a screen protector before, but with my latest iphone, I decided to. Due to my clumsiness, I have dropped it once, cracking the screen protector, and then again cracking the camera lens protector. This latest time, the iphone fell out of my pocket, not realizing it. Thought I had lost the phone. In any case, I did recover it. It looks like it had been run over as both the screen protector and case were damaged. Got home popped the old screen protector off (I do find it is easier to use a pocket knife to remove it, than trying to use the tool they provide. Just have to be a bit careful), installed a new shield and the phone is good as new (still seems to work even having been run over!)(a testament to Apple?). Anyway, this product is well worth the purchase. I have bought another pack of them. Given my history, I will use them!!!",

The screen protectors for the touch screen and the cameras are so worth it. The pry bar that comes with this kit makes replacing both protectors so easy. The guide for the front screen ensures that you have a perfect placement every time. The directions in the case come with pictures and it\u2019s really easy to follow the steps. Comes with 3 replacement screens for both the camera and the front screen. They hold up well. I\u2019ve never had a scratch on my actual device thanks to these bad boys. Saved my rear camera from damage while we were traveling. Doesn\u2019t leave a weird residue on your device when you replace them. Compatible with iPhone 14.",
