                "reviewText": "I am currently sporting the Samsung Watch6 40mm, which is a beautiful daily companion, and I am very accident prone, so I knew I had to choose a very high quality and robust screen protect and bezel protector in order to perfectly preserve this watch's beauty for many years to come. I came across this KIMILAR 5 pack, which had bezel protectors in 5 different colors, along with 5 screen protectors, and this appealed to me greatly because I wanted a black colored bezel protector to match my watch and I really liked having the comfort of having 5 screen protectors because that meant I had 5 chances to install it correctly and perfectly (as I am also not the best screen protector installer). I have been using the screen protector and bezel protector for over a month now and I can say with certainty that this is the best possible protector you can get for your Samsung watch, if you are searching through other similar products right now, please close your other tabs, because this is the best protector you can buy on Amazon, hands down, no doubts or questions about it. You can save yourself time and add this fantastic package to your cart right now and know that you are getting a quality product that will not let you down or disappoint you, but if you want to know more details about why this combo product is absolutely amazing, please read on!I will tell you honestly that installing the screen protector itself was very easy and straightforward. What was not easy was ensuring that I did not get any dust trapped between the watch screen and the screen protector, this happened on my first try and was completely my fault. Which is why I was so happy that I had 4 more chances to get this right!! Thankfully on my second attempt, I was able to successfully center the screen protector and it adhered to the watch face quickly and perfectly. The screen protector does not impede the sensitivity or usability of the screen at all, it does not negatively impact the clarity of the screen itself (it still looks crystal clear), and the screen protector is very easy to clean when it gathers fingerprints and water droplets. The screen protector is of phenomenal quality, as I have exposed it from everything to rain and fingerprints to heavy hits against tabletops, and this screen protector has held up like a champion, and more importantly it has flawlessly protected my watch face with no signs of damage whatsoever.Soon after I placed the screen protector upon my watch, I installed the black bezel protector and this device installed seamlessly on the Watch6 40mm, it fits snug like a glove, and as you can see in my pictures, the quality, color, and fitting of this bezel protector is so top notch that it looks like an OEM product that came preinstalled on the watch!! This bezel protector has been a boon for me as it has successfully protected my watch faithfully over the past month without any scratches, chips, or dents to the watch itself or the bezel protector through quite a few accidental wall thuds and table bumps.Overall, I cannot praise this combo product offered by KIMILAR enough, it has protected my watch flawlessly and I know that it will continue to do so for many years to come. So, if you are looking for a quality protector for your new Samsung Watch, look no further, you have found it right here.",

Easy to change out to fit the mood your in. The included screen protectors go on sooo easily and stay on. Yet come off when you need to change them. The screen protectors do not hinder the tpuch capabilites of the watch.I wear my watch continually. I have cut grass, worked on cars, swam, and just lived life in general and these protectors have already saved my watch from dings and scratches MANY times.The WIDE array of colors is a nice touch also. With the ability to switch colors to fit my mood or clothing.This is a simpke and cheap but AMAZING product.",

                "reviewText": "This watch protector has already proven itself. It fits like a glove on the watch, nice and snug, you can't even tell it's there (I'm using the clear one currently). I am the perfect height for slamming my wrist into doorknobs. I've cracked screens on other watches in the past. After reading reviews I chose this product and am so happy with it. It came with a screen protectors that went on very easily, no bubbles and I can't even tell that its there. The colors of the cases are great, these should last the lifetime of the watch. Thanks for making a great product at a fair price!",

                "reviewText": "This is a great package because, not only do you get a set of 5 plastic covers to protect and change the color of the case on your watch, but you get a set of 5 glass screen protectors as well. First, the plastic covers are rigid and hard plastic and are installed and removed pretty easily. They are flat (not glossy) or a matte finish. Not sure how the color will hold up over time as I did get these just recently. The best part is the set of 5 glass screen protectors. The price alone is worth that! These come with a suction cup and cleaning pads to make the install quite easy. Any bubbles can be worked out very easily and what doesn't come out right away seems to disappear in a day or two. Highly recommended to keep the case and screen of your new watch in great condition!",
