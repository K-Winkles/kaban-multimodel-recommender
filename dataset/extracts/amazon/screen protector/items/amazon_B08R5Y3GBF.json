The plastic flexibility is the exact reason why we call it tempered glass screen protector. Tempered glass is a type of safety glass that is stronger than ordinary glass. 2. It cannot be seen from the appearance that it is glass or plastic. As a customer, what can we do to identify it? There is an easy, quick, cost-effective way to test it yourself, and it's very accurate. Most plastics have a melting point between 160 and 210 degrees Celsius, and glass materials are at least over 1400 degrees Celsius, so is there a lighter around? 3. Does it come with a cleaning wipe to use prior to placing on the phone? Yes, the package includes: 6*Guide Stickers, 3*Wet Wipe & 3*Dry Wipe, 3*Dust Absorber 4. How can I remove bubbles? Use the kit in the package to clean the screen before placing the screen protector. If there are bubbles,try to gently press the bubbles with your finger or with a ruler,but the screen surface needs a thin cloth pad to avoid scratching the protector. 5. How can I remove a cracked glass screen protector? Lift the screen protector with the card from any corner of the screen protector, then hold the corner and remove slowly. (If you find CHIP or CRACK on the screen protector, for your safety, please wear gloves when removing the screen protector.)",

Since I received the protectors, the first one broke during installation and the other got several hairline cracks within a day of installation. The second is the one I'm currently leaving on until a worse break forms, and is the one in the photos.While easy to install, even if there is nothing perceivable on your phone there will be dust bubbles no matter how carefully you put it on. I assume it's picking dust I can't see out of the air on the adhesive, but I have no way of knowing.That being said, it does fit my A13 perfectly size wise. There is a tiny gap between it and the otter box I have it in, but compared to the gap of the original it's miniscule in comparison.I might buy again as it does seem to be working. We'll have to see how the last in the pack holds up.",

However these ones do a great job and i divvy feel like I'm replacing them super often. That being said I don't know if it's my phone or the protector but there are times my screen isn't as responsive even with the sensitivity turned up. Thats the only reason I've changed it recently, I thought maybe I left a piece of dirt or something. I don't have the problem as often now only once in a while. Overall I'd say they hold up pretty good.",

Put it on flat surface and stand over the top to apply to your phone would be my advice. I wish it was just a bit bigger to cover a little more. I know it says smaller to accommodate curved edges but it would be nice it it actually went a little closer to those curved edges. I do have a very slim minimal kind of case. Boyfriend had a bulkier case and it covered those edges not covered by screen protector.The quality of these though? So worth it and totally outweighs my nit-picky comment above. I have gone through so many of these before! I am forever dropping my phone. This one has lasted the longest, and not a scratch on it. Also easy to clean!You won't regret buying these!",
