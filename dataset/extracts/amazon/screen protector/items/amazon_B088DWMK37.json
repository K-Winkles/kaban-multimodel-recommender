I pulled off the shattered screen protector and my phone was not damaged what so ever! It wasn\u2019t even scratched!!! This definitely has paid for itself!! It was very easy to install on the screen. It did not cause any issues with the front facing camera. The camera piece cracked another time and it was great to have the extra to replace it right away!",

I dropped it a few times since I applied the product about 5 months ago and while the cracks appeared quick enough with each drop, I finally replaced the screen when they became more annoying to observe through. The camera lens protector I noticed became easily scratched from the beginning but that's probably more because it slightly sticks out past my case. My phone was pristine after the change with none of the damage made it through the protector onto my phone's screen and camera. My case is an Otterbox Symmetry series. Only gave it 4 stars as the cracks to happen quick with each drop instead of being sturdy enough to last a few times. Otherwise I am happy with the product. I wish I read the info more carefully though as this one only gives two camera lens protectors instead of three to match the amount of main screen protector.",
