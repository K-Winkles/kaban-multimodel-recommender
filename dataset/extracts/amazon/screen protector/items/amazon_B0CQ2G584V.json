                "reviewText": "So I put this screen protector on my brand new newly opened phone. To apply it it does come with some wipes and everything to properly clean the screen and free it from any dust or fingerprints. As I did this on my brand new phone I put it on right after I took the original screen protector off. Even with doing that my home is not dust free and fortunately and somehow there is still one or two specs that found their way in. This is through no fault of the screen protector. But once it happened there was absolutely no way to fix it. Overall it went on very easily there were a few Bubbles as you can see in my photos. Also a slight line from where I took the top part off to start the sticker before I put on the rest to towards the bottom. This was the reason I took one star from the review. Overall it is a very nice privacy screen and works exactly as described. I had no issues doing my fingerprints on the phone. And I can definitely see all the smudges as if it was glass from daily use of the phone. However that is to be expected. It does make my screen slightly darker but I feel like all security screens do this. If you're looking for a security screen I would recommend this one. Easy to put on and easy to take off!",
