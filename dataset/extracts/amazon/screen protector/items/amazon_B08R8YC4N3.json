                "reviewText": "I want to love this screen protector. It was easy to put on and prevents the glass on my phone from scratching. In fact, I slipped on the ice a few days ago and the phone went flying out of my hand and landed on the icy concrete, face down. My phone was perfectly fine, no scratches or cracks! That being said, however, the fingerprint reader does not work at all. I erased my old fingerprints per the instructions and set up a new one. The setup took a long time because it would not read my fingerprint. I finally got that step completed but have been unable to use the reader since I purchased this protector a few months ago. It's very annoying. If any of you have any hints for making it work, I am open to all suggestions.",

                "reviewText": "At first I had an issue with the fingerprint reader but after rescanning the prints it works fine as long as your fingers aren't super dry. I managed to crack my first screen protector about three days after installing. I emailed support and they immediately shipped out a replacement. Awesome service! Will buy again when needed.Con: the camera protector piece is a great idea but it interferes with the picture quality and if you use the flash it really absorbs the light. Perhaps a different design would eliminate that. Using that piece is not recommended for quality images.",

                "reviewText": "The protector fit my phone perfectly. The camera lens cover fit perfect too. It was very easy to install. The privacy feature when looking at it from the side was great and I really wanted to like it because I use my phone a lot in court and other people have a tendency to get nosy. Unfortunately I could not get used to it. When you looked straight at the screen it was dimmer and the tiniest bit fuzzy. Turning up the brightness and removing the blue light filter only helped a little bit. Also, despite setting up the fingerprint twice like it said and turning up the sensitivity I had problems with scanning my fingerprints to get in the phone. I krpt it on for a day or two thinking I would adjust but unfortunately I just couldn't so I returned it. That's why I gave it 3 stars. Maybe it was a failure of my high expectations.",

Some people mention the fingerprint reader not working properly you need to go into your display settings and turn your touch sensitivity on this will increase the sensitivity of the screen it's for use with screen protectors. I often program in my same fingerprint twice in the biometrics and have zero issues unlocking my phone first try every time with fingerprint. No moon where the fingerprint reader is like with some screen protectors. If you use a spigen tough armor case you will get edge to edge coverage. Overall a good buy very happy with this purchase. Having the frame that pops over the phone makes installation super easy and perfectly aligns the protector. You need to make sure that there is not a single speck of dust on the screen when you install the protector or you will get bubbles. Clean well with the alcohol wipe then the microfiber cloth. Then use the dust removal stickers to clean up any and every speck of dust this part is crucial. No dust no bubbles it's that simple.",
