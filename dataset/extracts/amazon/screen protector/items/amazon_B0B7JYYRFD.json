Glad I did cause everything about these is exceptional. It's so easy to install on to the phones I was able to even do it myself, not a bubble in sight crystal clear image. All the buttons work nicely and it has held up to be a great protector so far seeing as how I drop my phone too many times to even count. My son plays with my phone and I now can confidently hand it over with no fear. My favorite part is that it comes with 3 and a bonus is the camera lens protectors also, definitely a necessity for sure. They did not disappoint!",

Not a big deal but...I would have given it 5 stars, but the wet wipes are missing so I took 1 star off. Otherwise, this is a great product and for the price of $5 and change it's a no brainer.",

No problems and it fit well the phone.The camera cover was easy to install to, it fits well, and gives the finishing look I think apple missed. It fits well also on my cellphone case.The camera cover cracked when we accidentally dropped the phone. Maybe this if the reason the box comes with 3 of them.",

                "reviewText": "I am very picky when it comes to phone accessories, but I am very happy with my purchase. Its not perfect be it still beat my expectation. First the bad, the rear camera cover I am not impressed with. It adds quite a bit of bulk, will smudge easily with fingerprints and after a week already has a small scratch. But is see this as a bonus item and will give it a shot to see how it fairs long term. For the good, the main screen protector is easy to install, has plenty of wet and dry wipes as well as dust removal stickers for installation. Unlike most screen protectors I have tried this glass feels amazingly smooth and is very fingerprint resistant. It is not a full edge to edge protection which leaves a small gap since I use a very slim case. For people with larger cases this will be beneficial to reduce any interference.",

All I did was slide my phone across the table and part of it just completely shattered into little tiny bits, I\u2019ve never damaged a phone in anyway whatsoever in my entire life and I\u2019ve had cell phones since back in the day when you had to carry a big kiss around with you when you\u2019re paid five dollars a minute. Not happy with this product. It was less expensive than others but I certainly didn\u2019t expect it to shatter in a week. Pretty bummed.",
