                "reviewText": "This temperglass is really good. The entire glass spreads ALL the way to the edge of the screen. You wouldn\u2019t even know it was there if you put it on correctly. The only downside is, I bought 2 otterbox cases. The Otterbox symmetry series case fit perfectly over and I only saw tiny bubbles along the edge. You would only notice if you looked really close while the screen is turned off. But then I got a Otterbox Defender XT case. And when I put that on it lifted the ENTIRE temper glass. And when you try to push it underneath you\u2019re left with a HUGE, noticeable bubble along the lower half of the screen. I\u2019m disappointed. Cause I love the defender case but that means I would have to look for another temper glass that has a little more space between the glass and the actual case. But the screen protector is really good.",

                "reviewText": "We purchased two sets of these (one for our iPhone 15 and one for our IPhone 15 pro - yes you need to purchase one for each specific phone even tho the screen size is same their is a slight difference). They were SOO EASY to install. Now we did get a couple of small little bubble clusters when we were installing but we didn\u2019t panic - all we did was kept using the dry cleaning cloth (which is included) and applied pressure as we wiped the bubbles towards the edges until they disappeared AND they turned out PERFECT!! Great price and it\u2019s sooo easy to use !!!",
