                "reviewText": "The one thing about this specific screen protector pack that convinced me to buy it was the alignment frame, and I'm not disappointed at all. I love it. It made the screen protector centered aligned on my phone on the first try and fits the product perfectly. I wish more screen protector products would include a frame like it. The frame makes this pack worth it, and if you're like me and tired of trying to put the protector on right and then having to re-lift it to make small changes, then this is a must-buy.Even without the frame though it would've been a solid purchase. The packaging includes three sets of wet cleaning and drying wipes (other screen protector packs I've bought have only provided one set even if there were multiple screen protectors in the purchase) that help ensure your phone is clean and dust free before you put the protector on. Other products don't even include cleaning materials. I used the wipes and didn't get any air bubbles. If you're worried about putting the screen protectors on or how to use the wipes, watch the video that the seller made specifically for this screen protector. I was impressed that they even had one, and they made it super clear on what to do, except for one minor thing which I'll talk about below.The one part of the product that was less than stellar was the microfiber cloth that they included. In the installation video, the demonstrator uses the microfiber cloth to dry the screen after using the wet wipe to clean the phone screen, instead of the smaller dry wipe that comes with the wet wipe. Maybe I was using it wrong, but when I used the microfiber cloth to dry my phone, I kept finding dust particles stuck to the screen even after drying over and over again. I used the dry wipe that comes with the wet wipe instead and that seemed to work better. Not a big deal at all, and you can still have a perfect installation using either, but I think the microfiber cloth might confuse some or be a little inconvenient during initial installation.",

                "reviewText": "In the past I've always gone to my cellular service to purchase screen protectors so they would put them on for me. Being a perfectionist, I never could get them on myself without being crooked or getting a giant hair in the middle of the screen. I decided to take a chance with this product because it said it had an alignment frame included. The directions included a video link that was very easy to understand. The prep work was a piece of cake and I like that they included a sticker to remove any dust from the screen once you cleaned it with the clothes. Having multiple pets this was a lifesaver. The alignment frame worked like a charm for my two iphone 8 plus and the glass protector went on perfectly aligned and without any bubbles underneath. The touch responsiveness seems to not be affected by the glass. I recommend this to anyone who wants to save some money and also wants to have an aligned screen protector.",

                "reviewText": "Got 2 new Pixel 8s. Screen protector went on the first one great, good adhesion across the full screen, no bubbles. Second not as well. The sides would not adhere along the edges as seen in the picture. I had watched the installation videos, which were not very informative or thorough, especially for someone who has been installing these for years on several different phones. Contacted the seller. After a few emails to prove the issue, they offered a replacement. Then they came back and said they were out of stock (convenient) and offered a 50% refund instead. Sort of disappointing. Might order a second set and see how they fair.",
