                "reviewText": "The quality and feel of this glass is superb! I don\u2019t always use screen protectors, but I installed amFilm protection on both my Nintendo Switch and iPhone SE (2nd edition), as both devices are known to have screens somewhat susceptible to marring or scratching. In fact, I noticed some marring (rubbing marks, not quite scratches) had formed on my iPhone SE\u2019s unprotected screen shortly after getting it, convincing me I to go ahead and install this product. Now, not only does my iPhone SE now feel like a more premium product (much more like the default glass on my much more expensive iPhone XS Max), it is truly a pleasure to use and the marring spots are magically invisible!Installation is super straightforward and comes with everything you need, including two glass film, to do a professional job, even someone like me who has shaky hands. A good tip for smooth installation is to do so in a bathroom with the shower running hot to produce steam. This virtually eliminates dust particles in the air and allows the glass to adhere easily to prevent bubbles. Even small bubbles can be worked out more easily. If you have to carefully reapply the glass if you didn\u2019t get it quite straight or if there is a stubborn bubble, the steam helps that as well.Another pro tip: I had to straighten and reapply the glass, and it left a tiny sliver of the bottom corner slightly lifted where it would no longer adhere to the screen. I read about dipping a q-tip into some olive oil (or other cooking oil), lightly coated, and slightly rubbing the oil around that unsealed corner, which I did, and it sealed right up perfectly as a tiny bit of oil gets under the edge and reestablishes the adhesion. Just lightly dab the excess oil with a lint free cloth, and the screen looks flawless!",

                "reviewText": "I only bought this because of COVID. In any other circumstances, I would have paid for a screen protector at the Verizon store so I could have an employee put it on for me and I wouldn't have had to carry my phone around in a sock for a week until the screen protector came in the mail and I mustered up the courage to put it on.Nevertheless, I'm actually really glad I wound up with this screen protector. I read the reviews and saw that it's especially suitable for the SE 2020's screen (which has slightly different proportions than the 7 and 8, even though the phone itself is the same size); I agree. The price is unbeatable, and the little kit comes with everything you need, including a 2nd screen protector. It doesn't noticeably affect the sensitivity of the touchscreen, and it adheres excellently so far (though it's been less than 2 months so we'll see).It's relatively easy to put on; I did have a problem with air bubbles initially, but those miraculously disappeared within a day (after some vigorous squeegee-ing that didn't seem to help much). It would be nice if there were written instructions rather than just a video, for those of us low-tech people who prefer the written word. Some dust does gather around the edges, but I imagine that could be an issue for pretty much all screen protectors.All in all, this is a great purchase. I got my brother to buy one for himself too, and I will recommend this screen protector to everyone else I know who gets an SE 2.",

                "reviewText": "I'm giving this 5 stars because I think it's the best option in this price range, but it does have a one noticeable issue (and one smaller one that all screen protectors share). I used this for my iPhone SE 2020/2nd gen.PROS:- Clear application instructions- Application wasn't tougher than other screen protectors I've used- Screen functionality is great on the covered parts of the screen- It covers more of the screen than many other screen covers (but it isn't perfect - see my \"Cons\" list for details)- No halo effect when applied correctly and carefully- It doesn't cover the front camera or the home button, so those function perfectly wellCONS:- It leaves a couple millimeters of the screen uncovered on each side and the top/bottom, so it doesn't cover the entire screen perfectly. You can see this in the picture I uploaded (which has a case on it, but you can hopefully see the border around the screen protector). This isn't a huge deal, but if you need to touch something on the very edge of the screen (like the letters on the right side of your contacts list), that's tough to do.- You need to be very careful when applying it, and you need to push down on the edges of the screen protector for a minute or two when you apply it so that it adheres well. If you're sloppy when you apply it, it won't work well, but that's the same with any screen protector so it's not a weakness of this one specifically.I haven't dropped my phone yet, so I don't know how good the protection itself is. If I end up dropping it, I'll update this and let you know if my screen cracked or not.Overall, I would definitely recommend this product. I think it is the best in this price range. I hope the details I gave are helpful.",

Many screen protectors now come with a template you put on the phone to ensure the glass goes exactly where it should. If this had one of those, I'd give it 5 stars.The glass looks perfect and all the bubbles initially \"trapped\" under the glass either dissipated or were easily pushed to the edge and forced out. I love this brand!",

El \u00fanico \"pero\" que le pongo es que la aplicaci\u00f3n no es tan f\u00e1cil ya que los adhesivos que tiene para que no toques el cristal se despegan si lo pones boca abajo (se despegan por la gravedad y el peso del cristal). Fuera de eso todo bien. Lo que s\u00ed no s\u00e9 es si la resistencia es buena porque no se me ha golpeado la mica. Por alguna raz\u00f3n no puedo subir fotos, pero me imagino que Amazon verifica que en efecto hice la compra.",
