Once again it was super easy to install and has been on for over a week now, which included a drop or two, and still looks great. I\u2019m not sure what was wrong with the first one I had but it seems like a fluke.I put this on Friday and Saturday morning I noticed a spiderweb of cracks. I didn\u2019t drop my phone or bang anything on it, not entirely sure what caused it. It was the easiest screen protector I\u2019ve ever put on which is why I went with two stars instead of one, I just wish it had lasted more than a day before cracking.",
