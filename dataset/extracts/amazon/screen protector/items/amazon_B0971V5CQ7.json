                "reviewText": "**Please note: ONLY fits the Moto G Stylus 5G with a 6.8 inch screen & the quad cameras on back (see pictures)**What comes inside the box: (see pictures)2 premium tempered glass screen protectors, 2 alcohol prep pads, 2 microfiber cleaning cloths, 2 dust remover stickers, 6 guide stickers, instruction card (for installing protectors/registering the lifetime warranty/contacting customer support).Make sure to register for the lifetime warranty within 14 days of purchasing.After picking out a phone case on Amazon, I scrolled down to the \"frequently bought together\" section, picked the option that said phone case + 2 pack screen protectors, and added it to my cart. It was that easy.I chose free shipping to save money but I still got it on the fastest shipping date, 2 days early!Packaging was sturdy & secure (see pics). It came in a thick mailer envelope, inside a hard shell case, with each screen protector wrapped separately in a foam sleeve.It was very easy to install, it took me less than 2 minutes to open packaging, clean phone, & install screen protector. Everything is clearly labeled and also coordinates with the steps on the outside of the hard case. There's even a clear tab on each screen protector showing you which side to peel off.Other features: anti-fingerprint, ultra clear, real glass, extreme sensitive, 9H ultra hard coated, oleophobic coating.I've only had it installed for like two days, so I can't tell you how strong it is or if it will hold up to life's accidents ect. It does look pretty thick (see pics) and it's not gotten scratched or covered in fingerprints yet. Since it came as a 2pack, I've got a backup if anything happens to the first one, and a lifetime warranty too.Overall: Great deal, Buy it!",

                "reviewText": "Bought these after having bought, and disliked, a official shield from Motorola, and was more impressed with these then those. It's a 2 Pack, so right away you get two tries if you fail, and a replacement if you don't. Compared to the Motorola one, I had nearly zero bubbles installing this, so it ultimately was useful, while the Moto one I wound up removing and returning as it had a horrific number of bubbles.On the negative side, there's no install guard like with Zagg shields or a few other brands, though to my knowledge Zagg only produces for the base Moto G Stylus, not the 5G model, at present. In addition, I'mm about 3 weeks into using these and a small chip has developed around the piece of glass near the front camera lens. Up until now, I've never had a shield chip, though I believe this is my first from this brand.Would I rebuy one or recommend? I could recommend, but if I wind up needing another shield, I may shop around. The fast chip could be my fault, but having never had it happen before, I can't say I'm 100% confidant in this. Still, it's a good product for the price, so if that's a factor, definitely would recommend.",

He's clumsy when it comes to his phone so went with glass versus plastic. You can feel the quality and thickness of this one provided by Supershieldz. This is my third time buying from them for different phones that should tell you something. Thanks guys!",
