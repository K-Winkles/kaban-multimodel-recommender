                "reviewText": "I just replaced my phone with a Samsung s23 plus and figured rather than using the screen protectors which use UV curing glues like previously, as this phone has a flat screen, I'll try a more economical and simpler tempered glass protector. I rush purchased another brand as it had 4.5 stars but found it would not adhere in spots despite there not being any dreaded lint bubbles. This was a far superior product, both in the simplicity of install and function. You can tell it was designed better from the start as it comes with a screen alignment jig with the protector already it, the microfiber screen cloth to use after using the alcohol wipe was a decent size and sturdiness, and the whole screen dust removal sticker was larger than the screen (not just barely the same size).As I was installing this protector immediately after I removed the prior poor quality one, I just used the full screen sticker and then placed the jig and installed this protector. It laid down flat, no bubbles, no problem. I used the alcohol wipe and microfiber patch to clean the screen protector after installation as there were slightly visible traces of adhesive from the blue sticker which I'm assuming held the screen protector to the jig. The install took less time than it took to insert the phone back into my two piece outer protective case! Now my S23+ screen looks clean and most importantly, the ultrasonic finger print scanner works again(it failed to recognize or add with the prior protector). Very happy with this product!",

I didn't even realize it was on there cause I had no bubbles to push out. Followed the directions which were simple steps and it worked out amazing. Hopefully it will last nicely as well.For the phone camera protector, it was easy to put on since it aligns right up with your cameras. I had no issues with quality of my camera, I would say make sure you clean your camera very well before hand though to ensure that. I have a otterbox case and a wallet case I use for travel and neither have issues with the camera protector.",

                "reviewText": "Everything is perfect with this product.The application can be done by a child, with it's easy snap on case.Pull your finger through a couple times and Voila...you watch the protector glide down the screen with perfect flatness as it tightly bonds to your screen.Everything is great and so is the little bits of fabric curly Qs that got stuck underneath.I took the upmost precautions, a small clean bathroom with fog from a hot shower weighing down all air borne dust particles, a lint free cushioned cover, a closed bathroom door and a set of surgical gloves.Didn't matter how I kept everything spotless and in perfect proximity for the surgery.I used the full sheet sticky they provided, but my phone was clean.One quick smooth install later and in the light refraction I could see some air borne pollutants.They were way too deep to fix and the protector firmly holds to the phone, so basically in the end, I DESTROYED the first attempt. My luck with these things.As for the 2nd and final attempt, everything was similar and only 3 small items were found sufficiently close to the edge that I could raise the protector and get them out with the sticky tabs they provided.Here's a valuable tip on how to lift the protector once it's on the phone.Use a thin sharp edge knife and press it with measured firm pressure against the middle of the TOP of the protector edge and LIFT up. The knife will not go underneath it and if you lift slowly the protector will unbond and allow you to hold it's edges up so you can fish a sticky tape underneath. Sometimes the offending piece is stuck to the protector underside, so just turn the tape sticky side up.I had to lift the edge about 3 times and each time it lifted flawlessly without taking out a finger. Again, measured deliberate slow pressure...then UP.If you try this at a corner you will be sorry.Anyways, I wrote a book so I'll have to charge you for it.Jokes aside, it's the best protector I've ever used, and my finger and stylus works perfectly.Hope this helps some poor soul.",

                "reviewText": "I got this the same day because I put a chip in my previous screen protector. This is an excellent product. It was very easy to install. I did have a minor problem. When I pulling on the tab to remove the backing of the screen protector, the backing ripped. Luckily I was able to peel it off without smudging the protector itself. I like that is had a holder ao I could align it on my phone without it getting crooked. I told that company that I definitely will purchase these in the future. The camera protector was easy to install as well.",

Noticed a small blemish in the protector. It completely spidered that same day. Protector seems thin and doesnt hold up to others. Good thing is that my phone screen didnt take any damage and that this pack comes with multiple protectors. All in the end cant really complain if it protected my phone screen.",

In conclusion, the amFilm OneTouch is a trustworthy and top-notch option for keeping your screen safe.",

And, it's perfect!The installation process is as foolproof as possible and the glass quality is top notch. Fingerprint scanner also works nigh flawlessly, after re-registering my fingerprints after installation.Edit after fall: My phone fell from about 5 feet and survived. I have a Tough Armour Case from Spigen and AmFilm tempered glass on my S23.",
