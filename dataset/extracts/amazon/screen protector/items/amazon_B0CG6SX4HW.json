They have a slit for the speaker at the top but it covers everywhere around it. Some of them have a dip in it so that parts stays uncovered. It stuck on really easily. No bubbles at all.

First of all, one of the screen protectors came BROKEN. I was extremely disappointed however decided to give this product a chance. Yesterday, I was walking and my phone slipped out of my hands accidentally and it fell but not from high up. My phone shattered and at first i thought the screen protector was the only part that broke. I WAS VERY WRONG. I peeled of the screen protector to see if any damage was done, a lot was done. My phone is completely cracked and the camera is severely damaged as well. For a product that is supposed to protect your screen, it did the EXACT OPPOSITE. I AM EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED.",
