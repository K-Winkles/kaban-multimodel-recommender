                "reviewText": "Wow, this was really easy to install. Please, do yourself a favor and watch the YOUTUBE video a couple of times BEFORE you start!I purchased iPhone 11's for my brother and nephew, who are notorious for breaking screens and phones. To save the headache, I bought (2) cases (it was UAG I believe) and (2) sets of these UNBREAKcable Screen Protector. Each set comes with (3) screen protectors, and believe me, I needed the extra one.I watched the video, but I thought using the sticker after I wiped down the NEW phones was a waste of time and skipped the step. DOH! DON'T DO THAT - use the sticker and re-trace your steps. Dust is tiny, tiny, and monstrous. It snuck on the first phone install, as did bubbles under the glass. Well, because I didn't watch the video close enough - DOH!I tried again, used the stickers, FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS, and voila! Perfect... looked pristine, clear glass, no bubbles, no worries. The COOLEST thing is that you get it lined up with a guidance thingie, and then you simply TOUCH THE CENTER of the protector, and it attaches like magic. This helps seal out the bubbles, but if you mess up, they have some info on how you can take it off and try again. Just READ AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS, unlike I did at first... lol.After I removed the guidance thingie they provided, I smoothed out the edges by using the cloth provided, just to make sure it was connected entirely to the phone. Beautiful... smooth... showroom quality.After both were installed, I put them in their phone cases. If you have to switch out a SIM card, you can hold off on the last part until you've done that step.The rep at the T-Mobile store (went there with them to make sure they were set up, I'm not their phone tech... lol) commented that the screen protectors were perfect. He asked (and maybe you will too) why I bought an extra set.My nephew drops his phone ALL THE TIME. I fully expect him to crack the screen protector at some point. If they have the new ones, they can look online, take off the broken protector, and re-install another one.ANY PROTECTOR CAN BREAK. If it breaks, that means that it has probably protected the actual screen from breaking. I'd rather replace the protectors several times in the life of the phone than replace the phone. He broke his phone so bad last time that it wouldn't ring anymore. That's not very safe... and he didn't want to use a case.Buy a case and use it. Buy these protectors and use them... buy extra! Be sure to get the right size for your phone, and try this particular brand. It's fantastic, and the cost is very reasonable.If this has helped you at all, please give me a HELPFUL vote, and feel free to ask me any questions. Have a great year!",

                "reviewText": "When I got my new phone from the store, they tried to sell me a screen protector, but I only buy these screen protectors because they are amazing to install by yourself without help from a tech person. They last a long time even with me always dropping my phone everywhere. The screen protector is very durable. So, I suggest that if you are looking for screen protectors for your phone, I would buy these for sure. You get three in the package.",

With the instructions, I had little trouble placing the glass screen protector on the phone. Even though you have a 3-pack, be careful. Glass is not forgiving if not applied well or with fingerprints on the bottom side of the glass. I had a little air that I worked out so the glass piece lays flat.",

I feel like it was still protecting the screen, even with cracks, but my early teen kids handle their phones like they\u2019ve been greased or something and are constantly dropping them. These are really easy to apply using the guide, or if you\u2019ve put on as many screen protectors on iPhones as I have, they\u2019re easy without the guide. I had no trouble pulling it off to put the new one on and it left no residue or stickiness. The size is perfect for the model indicated and the clarity and touch functionality are also very good.",

                "reviewText": "Ich habe vor kurzem das UNBREAKcable Schutzfolien-Set f\u00fcr mein iPhone 11 erworben und bin von der Qualit\u00e4t und Leistung absolut begeistert. Das Paket enth\u00e4lt drei Schutzfolien, was ein gro\u00dfartiges Preis-Leistungs-Verh\u00e4ltnis bietet.Die Installation der Schutzfolie war denkbar einfach. Das Paket enth\u00e4lt eine detaillierte Anleitung sowie alle notwendigen Werkzeuge, um eine blasenfreie Installation zu erm\u00f6glichen. Ich war angenehm \u00fcberrascht, wie einfach und schnell ich die Folie anbringen konnte, ohne dabei l\u00e4stige Luftblasen oder Staub einzuschlie\u00dfen. Die pr\u00e4zise Passform der Folie f\u00fcr das iPhone 11 und XR ist wirklich beeindruckend.Ein weiterer bemerkenswerter Aspekt der UNBREAKcable Schutzfolie ist ihre Haltbarkeit. Die Folie besteht aus hochwertigem 9H geh\u00e4rtetem Glas, das einen ausgezeichneten Schutz vor Kratzern, St\u00f6\u00dfen und St\u00fcrzen bietet. Ich habe mein iPhone mehrmals fallen gelassen, und die Schutzfolie hat es erfolgreich vor Besch\u00e4digungen bewahrt. Ich bin wirklich beeindruckt von der Widerstandsf\u00e4higkeit dieser Folie.Die Schutzfolie beeintr\u00e4chtigt in keiner Weise die Ber\u00fchrungsempfindlichkeit des Bildschirms. Ich kann mein iPhone weiterhin problemlos bedienen und die Touch-Interaktion ist genauso reibungslos wie zuvor. Dar\u00fcber hinaus ist die Oberfl\u00e4che der Folie oleophob beschichtet, was bedeutet, dass Fingerabdr\u00fccke und Schmierflecken leicht abgewischt werden k\u00f6nnen.Was mir besonders gef\u00e4llt, ist die Klarheit und Transparenz der UNBREAKcable Schutzfolie. Sie beeintr\u00e4chtigt die Anzeigequalit\u00e4t meines iPhone-Bildschirms nicht und sorgt f\u00fcr eine gestochen scharfe Darstellung. Es gibt auch keine Verzerrungen oder Regenbogeneffekte, die bei minderwertigen Schutzfolien manchmal auftreten k\u00f6nnen.Zusammenfassend kann ich das UNBREAKcable Schutzfolien-Set f\u00fcr das iPhone 11 und XR nur w\u00e4rmstens empfehlen. Es bietet eine einfache Installation, hervorragende Haltbarkeit, hervorragenden Schutz und verbesserte Sichtbarkeit.",
