                "reviewText": "I used amFILM for my previous iPhone and liked it enough to purchase this for my new iPhone. The big change is the plastic template they now provide to line up the glass protector. It made the installation flawless. I had it on so fast I was almost disappointed that I didn't get to work a little harder :). I'm crazy careful about stuff like this. I have to live with it for a couple of years and want it right. The new system makes it almost foolproof. And I have two spares left for 1/3rd the cost of other screen protectors. My previous experience tells me I'll have at least two years of use from each one, so this package will likely outlast my phone",
