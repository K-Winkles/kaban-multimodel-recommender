                "reviewText": "This screen protector (3 pack) is truly wonderful! It\u2019s a fantastic price and really a quality product. I was nervous to buy something \u201cso affordable\u201d for quality sake as it\u2019s protecting a major $ investment for me\ud83d\udcf1. It arrived on time in new great packaging. The instructions are very clear and precise. My favorite thing about this set is that it comes with so many cleaners and guides so it would be very hard to mess up the install unlike most others.I applied the glass protector without a case on (because there is a screen guide you should put over your phone so the glass protector will align perfectly on your screen). I used the wet cleaner wipe to clean my phone screen, then the dry one to dry it off with no/minimal lint. Then I placed the screen guide on top of my phone and it lightly snaps on to the top/sides (won\u2019t move but isn\u2019t hard to take back off at all). Then I used the sticker to dab the screen to pick up any remaining lint/etc. I inspected it by tilting the phone in all directions under light to make sure I got all the lint. Then I peeled off the plastic backing to the glass protector (making sure to only lightly be touching the sides of the protector) and placed the protector inside the guide starting with the top of the screen and letting it slowly fall down into place. The protector fits perfectly inside the guide and cannot be aligned incorrectly (unless you don\u2019t use the guide). My FAVORITE part... instructions say \u201ctap the center of the protector/screen twice fast\u201d and it\u2019s like MAGIC! I should have taken a video with a different phone! It\u2019s sooo cool! Once tapped, it starts to adhere itself to the phone and starts to force out all the air from the center outward. I didn\u2019t have any bubbles on the first phone and on the second, there weren\u2019t \u201cbubbles\u201d but like a tiny bit of air or not adhered area right on the very very edge like 1mm size really small so I just pushed on it with my finger from inside toward exiting the edge of the protector and it was then 100% perfect!!!I still do get fingerprints a Little Bit, but Nowhere near as much as I did with other ones Including Zagg. For me it is noticeably better in all areas. I haven\u2019t got a scratch yet, but I am super careful with my phone. If it does get one, I know I can replace it with the final glass screen in the box I didn\u2019t use or I can buy another pack if need be as they are so affordable.I will be switching to this protector exclusively from now on as I\u2019ve known no other one with such an easy (and fun) application. I used to always DREAD applying them for fear of the dreaded air bubbles and improper alignment. This was truly a breeze.Even with me being OCD about application, it only took about 5 minutes or less if you\u2019re not a perfectionist like me. \ud83d\ude2cI will also be making sure all my friends and family know about these for their future needs as well!Oh and the glass has no affect on the screen\u2019s color, brightness, clarity, camera, Face ID... nothing.\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c Would give 10 \u2b50\ufe0f if I could!",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: Well I guess my original review might have been too hasty. Barely 6 weeks after installing this tempered glass screen shield on my iPhone 11, and then putting that into a pretty nice leather and TPU foldover case for additional protection, it only took one unfortunately positioned drop of the cased phone onto concrete to badly crack the bottom half of my screen. It hit concrete right where the glass screen runs up to and around the front edge of the phone, where the screen shield leaves about 2-3mm of the edge of the phone screen unprotected, while only causing a tiny chip to the very edge of this tempered glass shield itself (no cracks in the cheap shield but several in the very expensive iphone screen itself). So this shield did not really provide much protection for the edges of the iphone screen. Oh well, guess I need to get a more protective case and not expect so much from this screen shield. So I dropped the rating from 5 stars to 4 for this issue of less than adequate coverage/protection.Original comments:I bought the three-pack for my new phone because last time I put a similar one on my previous iphone I broke it during installation, then broke a second one after installation when the sides of my protective case squeezed the edges too tight. So that time I needed a third one just to get it right eventually.This kit is a self-contained all-in one kit with an installation guide-frame, three sets of glass cleansing and drying pads, and three tempered glass plates ready for installation. It is so simple even I can get it right the first time. Tear open the cleansing pad package (like opening a sugar packet in a restaurant) and wiping down the screen surface, the tearing open the drying pad and wiping off any remaining liquid from the cleansing pad. Put the guide-frame over the from of the phone, peel off the plastic sheet covering the sticky back of the tempered glass shield, set the shield inside the frame starting at the top end and it pretty much installs itself after that adhesive starts grabbing your phone's screen. All you have to do is press it down from top to bottom then squeeze out any remaining bubbles. The guide makes sure it is perfectly centered. And the nicest part of the whole process is that the tempered glass shield is a couple millimeters smaller than the front surface of my phone so once installed it leaves about 2 mm of the screen uncovered all around the edges -- so no chance for any case pinching the shield's side and/or top edges and fracturing it after successful installation. Voila'.I gave the second shield to my wife and she installed hers in about 5 minutes with no problem. And now we have a spare for when (god forbid) one of us drops our phone on its face on some gravel and shatters the shield. But not the phone's screen.The tempered glass shield has slightly rounded edges so it is really smooth to the touch when you run our fingers around the screen edges. Clear as a bell, maintains touch screen functions, installs easy, and protects the screen of the phone, all for about 2 bucks per phone, and enough to do three phones.",

                "reviewText": "Omg. Easiest screen protector to install in the world. Doesn\u2019t affect the integrity of the keyboard. Comes with a snap on guide so this thing is basically fool proof. And three come in the box. No sure what the stickers are there for. The snap on guide makes the job impossible to screw up so stickers are unnecessary IF that\u2019s what they\u2019re for lol. Idk. Best Amazon purchase ever seriously!Update: I\u2019ve had the screen protector on for a little under a month and somehow the first screen protector I used had taken some trauma and shattered... this is for reasons unknown to me...I went into work And left my phone in the car, came out after work to use it and noticed a tiny fracture on the edge the screen, branching out from a teeny tiny shatter in the screen protector. I took my otter box off, used a credit card to lift the screen protector, and applied a new one. I still have one left. And this thing did it\u2019s job! My screen is intact. I am just so confused as to how it happened to begin with, as I was on it before going into my job and did not Notice any damage, and there were no bumps or drops.",
