                "reviewText": "I was looking for robust and effective protection for my daughter's phone, without sacrificing screen sensitivity, especially for the fingerprint. Overall, I'm happy. Screen protectors are easy to install and do not interfere with use. On the other hand, camera protectors are a little trickier to adjust.The tempered glass of the screen is great. It resists scratches well and fingerprints work smoothly. For the camera protector, it's a little less convincing. It protects, but sometimes it slightly affects the quality of photos. Clean the screen well before installation. Be patient and precise to align the protectors. For the camera, try not to touch it during installation.",

                "reviewText": "So why only 4 stars? The coverage area is a little small, meaning the edges clear the protective phone case, meaning if something hard hits the edge of the protector, it will crack. If it was a little larger and covered the entire screen, I expect this to be less of an issue. There are no tools to align this either, making application a little tricky.Also the front camera has no hole cut for it. This doesn't seem to impact the quality that much, unless covered in finger prints or other goo, so far no particular concerns.Fingerprint reader has no issues.I'm on my last protector and so far these seem to have out lasted the other ones thus far, so I will likely re-order in the future.",
