                "reviewText": "I buy screen protectors for all my phones, and whenever they break I replace them. This is probably the worst one I've ever purchased in 10 years, of over 20 different screen protectors I've purchased over those years.The kit comes with two screen protectors but only enough components like alcohol wipes and dust removing stickers for one screen to be installed.The kit is the most bare bones I've ever seen. No alignment tools, no tools for removing air bubbles. The instructions were a joke.The thumb print scanner on the screen protector is made of different glass and you can clearly tell. There's a giant very visible circle on my phone.The glass for the screen protector seems to smudge extremely easy. I understand that that's usually the case with screen protectors because it's not quite the same grade of glass as the cell phone, this is just really bad.The camera lens protector doesn't stick properly. Full of air bubbles.",

                "reviewText": "This product is easy to install and it certainly lights up an area. Added it to my attic and garage and what a difference it makes. The only issue I had was that it did not fit in a fixture in the closet. Not sure why but I could not turn it all the way in order for it to light up. Other than that it is fantastic.",
