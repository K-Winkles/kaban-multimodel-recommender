                "reviewText": "This is a nice feeling screen protector. It picks up a little more fingerprints then the normal display but its not a big deal. The protector will go past the screen a little into the bezel so you will be getting full screen protection and decent case compatibility. The fingerprint sensor works great after re-registering my fingerprints and the SPen did not show any issues when writing with it.I would recommend this to everyone as its is an extremely easy install.",

                "reviewText": "I have purchased and reviewed a couple of cases from Torras in the past and this has allowed me to appreciate the quality of the products they sell. I have one of their clear cases from over a year ago and it is just as clear as the day that I purchased it (so if you have ever owned a clear case you understand how amazing that it.)Application:The unpacking of the box will take longer that putting on this screen, but just to be sure watch the video of how to install (instruction sheet is included which can be seen in the photo.) Install is simple as it is just like all other screen protectors as far as prepping to put the screen protector on. Then it is drop, pull and lift. It is really just that easy, I can't stress that enough.Fit and Form:This screen is super slick which is a great thing as it is very similar to the OEM screen on the Samsung S24 Ultra. The screen also doesn't pick up fingerprints hardly at all which is a good thing too as fingerprints can be very distraction. The cutouts are perfect and should provide full screen coverage for the utmost coverage. The only downside of this screen is that is does reflect almost as much as standard tempered glass screens (can be seen in the pictures) but slightly better. The reason I bring up this point is that one of the selling points of the S24 Ultra is it's nonreflective screen. By no means does this distract from using this screen as it is fantastic but just a point of interest if that is a concern for you.Case Compatibility:I used this case from Torras in my test https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPHYV742?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details and as can be seen in the pictures there is only a tiny gap between the screen and the case which means ultimate protection.Conclusion:This screen protector- Easy to apply.- Provide full screen coverage- Case Compatible- Fully adhesive providing full clarity- Smooth as glass to the touch- Phone responsiveness is not impacted",

It comes with 2 screen protectors, one already installed in the frame guide and an extra for in case you mess up. However, even if you didn't read their easy to understand instruction guide, there's really no way to mess up. Installation was also a breeze with the orange down arrow \"pull\" tab. I spent more time on making sure there was no dust on my actual screen than installing. As the name says, this screen is as hard as a diamond, I used a metal folder clip and scraped the sharp edge all over the screen and there are no scratches. The screen protector is also very smooth and wow, does it do an a great job with resisting fingerprints! Tried to also purposely smear my fingers all over this screen and still nothing! Hands down a great screen protector and highly recommend to all!",

Boy, was I missing out! As seen in the photos, the packaging is so professional and clean and it looks like the company cares about the presentation of their product before you even use it on your device. This is true to every TORRAS product I have ever purchased. The kit comes with two tempered glass protectors, one already inside the installation frame and the other inside the fancy envelope with the cleaning supplies and instructions. The installation frame itself is sturdy and the installation process could not be more simple. These protectors may be a little more pricey than the ones from Spigen or other value brands, but they are totally worth the extra money you pay for them. Also, these work wonderfully with the fingerprint sensor. No reading errors in my experience. If you\u2019re considering these just take the chance and add them to your cart. You will be glad you did. I will now be purchasing a TORRAS screen guard along with my usual TORRAS phone case for my future devices!",
