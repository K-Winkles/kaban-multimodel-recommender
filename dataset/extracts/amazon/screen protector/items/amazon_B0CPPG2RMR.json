                "reviewText": "This glass protector is sturdy and durable and provides good protection for my phone. The instructions on how to install it are not very clear. I managed to do it but not by following the instructions. The kit comes with alcohol pads and a cleaning cloth to prepare your screen. It also includes a frame like device that helps you align the glass over your phone screen when applying. The two drawbacks of the screen protector are that they affect the fingerprint sensor performance a bit even after turning on the increased sensitivity option on my phone. I also re-registered my fingerprints through the glass. It still works but makes unlocking slightly more difficult. If you use face recognition, then this would not be an issue. The other drawback is that the S24 has a new Gorilla glass that reduces reflections. With the glass screen protector on, the screen reflects more and diminishes the new screen that is really impressive. This screen protector has advantages and disadvantages. It is very protective but comes with some trade-offs.",

                "reviewText": "Following the instructions, this was simple to install by lining it up inside the frame and dropping the glass onto the clean phone. As with all of these screen protectors, it's important your phone is clean and dust free and you install in a relatively clean, dust free environment to minimize the chance of something getting caught between the phone and glass during installation. What I did was drop the glass from one side and let it gently settle down at an angle to let the adhesive adhere across the screen like a pool of spreading water, which I find minimizes the chance of a rogue air bubble. If you do get an air bubble, all is not lost as you can gently pry up one side and lower it again as long as you didn't press down on the glass after dropping it. You can do this a couple times to get it perfect, just make sure you're slow and gentle. Again, I have to stress having a dust free place to do this is very important if you don't want to drive yourself insane. Once it's on there, it feels just like the phone's actual screen and does not interfere with performance in any way I can notice, including the fingerprint sensor. I've removed and put on various cases and the protector has not budged. I've not tested its durability, but mostly I just want to avoid scuffs and scratches on the screen from other things in my pocket, so for that, it works great.",
