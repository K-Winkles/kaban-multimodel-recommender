                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the LK 4 pack Screen Protectors for my IPhone 12, and I am delighted with the performance and quality that they offer. These screen protectors have proven to be a reliable and effective solution for safeguarding my device's screen, ensuring its longevity and pristine appearance.First and foremost, I was impressed by the ease of installation. The package includes everything needed for a hassle-free application process: clear instructions, a cleaning kit, and an alignment frame. The installation was straightforward, and the provided alignment frame ensured a perfect fit on my device's screen. Within minutes, I had a crystal-clear and bubble-free protector in place, fitting seamlessly to the contours of the screen along with tips to troubleshoot & remove bubbles, dust, etc.The quality of the LK screen protectors is exceptional. The ultra-thin yet robust construction maintains the responsiveness and clarity of the original screen, allowing for a seamless touch experience. The high-transparency feature ensures that the screen remains vivid and vibrant, without compromising on the brightness or color accuracy.Furthermore, the LK screen protectors boast impressive scratch resistance. Since using these protectors, I have been able to avoid any visible scratches or scuffs on my device's screen, even with the everyday wear and tear associated with regular use. This has given me peace of mind, especially when carrying my device in my pocket or bag along with other items.The oil-repellent coating is another outstanding feature worth mentioning. I have noticed a significant reduction in fingerprint smudges and oil residue on the screen since applying the LK screen protector. Additionally, the anti-glare properties of the protector minimize reflections and glare, making it easier to view the screen even in bright environments.In terms of durability, the LK screen protectors have exceeded my expectations. They have demonstrated excellent adhesive strength, staying securely in place without any signs of lifting or peeling. The protectors have proven to be highly durable and resilient, even after prolonged periods of use and exposure to daily elements.Lastly, the value for money that the LK 4 pack Screen Protectors offer is outstanding. With four protectors included in the package, I have spares to replace the protector if needed. This ensures long-term protection for my device, without the need to constantly repurchase new screen protectors.In conclusion, the LK 4 pack Screen Protectors have proven to be an excellent investment for maintaining the pristine condition of my device's screen. Their ease of installation, outstanding quality, scratch-resistant properties, and excellent value for the extremely reasonable cost make them a top choice for anyone seeking reliable and high-quality protection. I strongly recommend the LK screen protectors to anyone looking to safeguard their valuable device from scratches, smudges, and everyday wear and tear!",

                "reviewText": "I highly recommend these screen protectors. I purchased my new iPhone at a local store and the store was selling screen protectors, $50 for one tempered glass screen protector. I couldn\u2019t make myself do that and had a feeling I could find something of similar quality a lot cheaper. Fortunately, Amazon came through for me once again. You cannot beat the value of these screen protectors at 4 for $8. I was a little concerned about doing this myself as someone at the store where I purchased the original phone installed my first screen protector for me. However, the instructional video and instructions provided with the screen protectors explained the procedure quite well and I was able to install mine for the first time with no problems. I have had mine for over a month now, it\u2019s working exactly as my old screen protector on my previous phone which I had for over six years and dropped many times. I\u2019m sure it will continue to work just as well as it has been. But of course I have 3 back ups in case it doesn\u2019t. One word of caution, however, if you can\u2019t get a bubble out while you\u2019re installing it and you lift the protector to try to remove the bubble, it doesn\u2019t seem to reseal quite as well as it did originally. This happened to me in one corner, just a small area close to the edge, barely noticeable.",

                "reviewText": "Haven\u2019t installed a screen protector under 5 minutes EVER! The system is so simple that\u2019s no wonder it came with no instructions!These are my steps to success:- Just remove old/broken protector if any, lay your phone screen up in a clean surface- clean the screen with provided wiper pads and wipe screen with also provided screen cloth- slip/fit the frame/guide provided over your phone making sure the \u201cTOP\u201d side matches the top of your phone- VERY IMPORTANT!!! use the lint/dust round stickers to remove any possible invisible speckle of dust from screen- remove the backing of the screen protector to expose the sticky side (try keeping that facing down to avoid dust sticking to it before installation) and do it just before you\u2019re sure it\u2019s clean and you\u2019re ready to install it- gently lay the protector on top of your screen starting by the top side against the frame/guide you have installed 2 steps ago- once it\u2019s on the screen it will start pretty much gluing itself automatically but if not, it is as simple as touching/pressing one corner down and the process will start- YOU\u2019RE DONE! Just watch it gluing itself to the screen and make sure no air pockets are leftSuper precise and the very first one which has left not one speckle of dust under/between the protector and screen! Super satisfied! Will update if the protector itself present low protection but so far it\u2019s a keeper!",

                "reviewText": "I used a lot of protectors from the screen. The initial lines and application of the glass safety panel is obviously a crucial element for effectiveness, longevity and enjoyment (how good it performs its job of protecting), of the costly, sensitive and vital mobile phones we are increasingly relying on. Original misalignment and effort to reposition yourself is how the defender introduces air bubbles, residue (dust, hair), and fingerprints. Misalignment can also make it difficult to reinstall a secure, edge protection case by lifting or separating the edge of your new shield. The benefit of LK is that the entire process is basically stupid compared to other screens I use. Have the device used several times without ever introducing an air bubble or crack in many iPhone iterative processes. Excellent and good value for money. Higher-end glass displays are typical for durability. Must remember how initial errors in alignment can improve the chance of early cracks or how a bulb or dust particle may distract you from the screen and force you to dig up and start!",

Of course the initial alignment and application of the protective glass screen is the most critical determinant of efficacy (how well it does its job which is protection), durability and enjoyment of these expensive, delicate and critical smart phone tools we are increasingly dependent on.

Misalignment might also make reinstalling a tight, edge-protecting case impossible with out raising or fracturing the edge of your newly applied protector. LK\u2019s advantage over other screens I\u2019ve used is their alignment frame which essentially makes the whole procedure foolproof. Have used the product many times on multiple iterations of iPhone without ever introducing an air bubble or crack. Excellent and well priced. Durability is typical of higher end glass screens. Better if you consider how initial misalignment errors will increase the likelihood of early cracks or if a bubble or dust particle might drive you to distraction and cause you to ditch the screen and start over!",
