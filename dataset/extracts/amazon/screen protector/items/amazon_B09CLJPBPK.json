This product has excellent fingerprint recognition. The glass is hard shell and will likely protect your screen if dropped. There are 3 in the pack so should last a while over time.This is an update for the watch only. This is a 3pak and there's a reason...the glass cracks easily with no explanation I can determine. I'm careful with my watch. Twice I changed the cover and a while later I noticed fine cracks twice. No way has it affected my actual watch screen but I can't explain the fragility of the product. I shudder to think what would happen if I dropped the watch. I have one more cover left. Will see.",

                "reviewText": "Being as though I don't have Samsung Care on my device, I always make it a point to purchase a screen protector. I would highly recommend this purchase. If you look at the photos attached the glass screen protector is perfect and doesn't take away from the original sleek design of the watch. No bubbles. Easy installation if you're following the directions correctly. It does have little raised edges of course, but nothing too serious when combines with a watch bumper or frame case. However, I did experience some lifting with some protective cases. I was able to get the bubbles out easily by applying light pressure to the necessary area and gently guiding the bubbles towards the end. The adhesive is very strong though, but not the kind of strong where you take it off and it leaves the glue-like texture residue. It doesn't leave any marks behind if you need to by any chance remove it from your watch.",
