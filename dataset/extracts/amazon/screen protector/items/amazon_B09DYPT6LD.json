                "reviewText": "Let me start by saying that I have used dozens of different brands of screen protectors on many models of phones over the years (mostly iPhones but a few androids) as I have involuntarily muscle spasms/twitching and neuropathy in my hands and arms so I drop my phone frequently. I also have 2 little boys so I need my phone well protected at all times. I can honestly say i have never had an easier more seamless experience installing a screen protector than I did with this amFilm one touch tempered glass screen protector. I simply scanned the QR code on the instructions which simultaneously let me register the product and showed a simple video demonstrating the installation process. This was also the only kit that came with both a full screen sized dust removal sticker as well as the smaller individual dust removal stickers that most kits come with. That combined with the perfectly fitted plastic install guide made for a seamless experience with absolutely zero air bubbles or dust specks between the phone screen and the screen protector. In the video it does show you what to do if you happen to get an air bubble but that was unnecessary for me. I actually had to double check to make sure the screen protector was actually on my phone because it applied so flawlessly! I like the fact that it comes with 2 sets of screen protectors and 2 sets of installation kits so you don\u2019t have to reuse any of the pieces including the outer tray for the second protector if you happen to crack or damage the first one. I cant speak to durability yet but I can say that with my previous screen protector I was starting to have a lot of difficulty clicking on the exact part of the screen I was aiming for. I actually thought I was going to have to replace my phone because I was having so many issues. After applying the techmate amFilm screen protector my phone seems brand new again! No typing the wrong letters or having difficulty scrolling. It also seems to be quite fingerprint and smudge resistant so far. I will update my review if anything changes but as of now I would never purchase a different brand again. This review is my 100% honest opinion as a consumer. I paid full price for this product and did not receive any kind of free gift or discount in exchange for my review. I\u2019m simply sharing my experience as a consumer who counts on accurate product reviews when deciding what to purchase. In fact this was one of the few products on Amazon that didn\u2019t specifically request a written review in the packaging. Their warranty says if you\u2019re not 100% satisfied to contact them and they make it right. Clearly they are confident in their product and I agree it\u2019s an excellent screen protector. I am much more satisfied with the Amwell glass screen protector by techmate than I was with other screen protectors that cost 3Xs as much! I hope this review was helpful.",

The kit includes a plastic frame that fits over the phone, and a squeegee that is used to remove any air bubbles.I have been using the amFilm OneTouch screen protector for a few weeks now, and I am very happy with it. The screen protector is very clear and responsive, and it has done a great job of protecting my phone screen from scratches and bumps. I would definitely recommend this screen protector to anyone looking for a durable and easy-to-install screen protector for their iPhone 14 6.1\"/iPhone 13/iPhone 13 Pro 6.1\".Here are some of the pros and cons of the amFilm OneTouch screen protector:Pros:Durable tempered glass constructionEasy-to-use installation kitOleophobic coating resists fingerprints and smudgesCrystal clear screenCase friendlyCons:Can be a bit difficult to remove if you need toNot as scratch-resistant as some other screen protectorsOverall, I think the amFilm OneTouch screen protector is a great option for those looking for a durable and easy-to-install screen protector for their iPhone 14 6.1\"/iPhone 13/iPhone 13 Pro 6.1\". It is clear, responsive, and does a great job of protecting the phone screen from scratches and bumps. I would definitely recommend it.",

I have two phones and both installs were flawless.It comes with a dust removal sticker that covers the entire screen at once which gives you a dust free install every time. The installation tray fits snug and aligns perfectly unlike the worthless little plastic border aligners that are always slightly off.Even if they end up breaking easily, they are very affordable so replacing won\u2019t be a problem. Will definitely be ordering from AmFilm every time.",
