                "reviewText": "Installed on both my and my girlfriends iPhone 11s. Perfectly centered due to the frame and no dust due to the full size \u201csticker\u201d to take it off. Very effective. Only ran my air purifier the day of installing to help reduce dust but very surprised. No worries about anything messing up a perfect install.I\u2019m not impressed as many others have expressed by the lack of going further to the edges for protection. I think a solid millimeter could have been added to the perimeter all the way around. While it doesn\u2019t seem like much it\u2019s those exposed edges that are likely to catch something with a raised case and cause an issue. I had the same brand protector for my iPhone 7 Plus. While the case had peeled in the area the screen had cracked in on that phone (which replacing the case would have prevented) I think more area for the protector would have helped. This protector has similar \u201clack of\u201d coverage as the iPhone 7 Plus protector did.It has a notable small scratch after only three weeks, most likely from my keys. My old protector took years and dropping a piece of metal onto to damage on my iPhone 7 Plus so I feel like quality isn\u2019t the same.I would buy again, but would be on the lookout for something with better coverage and make sure it was as good clarity wise. The ease of install goes a long way though.",
