The included frame helped a lot. The included cardboard \"squeegee\" didn't help at all- I found that using my fingers to work out the air bubbles was very effective.The glass fit well with the Spigen Rugged Armor case. Even the camera lens protector fit under the case perfectly. Fingerprint sensor works well as does the face unlock. No problems with the glass so far, no funny rainbow colors, etc. Hope it'll hold up.",

                "reviewText": "Applying the screen protector is a fairly simple endeavor, but I have used plenty that are easier. It went down fine but bubbles around the edges can be troublesome.The camera covers, however, are absolutely useless. I can honestly say I used both that were supplied. Both applied easily, yet both CRACKED basically with regular use in less than 12 hours. No drops, no heavy hits, nothing. Looked at the phone and the protectors would be badly cracked and crumbling. Three them both out. What good is a protector if it spontaneously shatters?Still determining if the screen protector is a winner, but don't expect anything good from the camera protectors.",

                "reviewText": "This screen protector comes with two screen protector sheets, two protector sheets for the camera, a screen aligner frame for easy, flawless application, small cleaning products for the screen, a little scraper for the air bubbles (if there are any!), a link to a step by step application video that shows everything in real time, and a small packet that is nicely labeled Cute Stickers For Phone. It does indeed contain cute stickers for the phone (I especially liked the Shiba Inu eating ramen one), as well as a very nice little thank you card that motivated me to leave this review.The screen protector is rigid and easy to handle. The side that applies to the phone is protected by an easy to remove plastic cover that ensures its surface is not contaminated with dust before it's applied. The application frame made putting on the cover a breeze, with no air bubbles and perfect alignment on my first try! My fingerprint scanner is working perfectly and the touch screen seems to be as sensitive as ever. The screen cover also fits nicely with my case, as does the camera cover. I found the camera cover easy to put on as well, and it looks great.I would absolutely buy from this vendor again, and I would buy this screen cover again if I needed to (although I definitely won't have to - it comes with two!). I'm impressed with the product quality, the ease of use, the fact that the package contained everything I needed to put on the screen cover, and I loved the thank you note and stickers. A very nice touch in a world where a company may never meet their customers.",

                "reviewText": "From the moment I opened the package I was impressed - packaging is high quality and I enjoyed the little gift of fun stickers! The guide is very useful, fits the phone and lines the protector up perfectly. The protectors are obviously glass rather than plastic (which I know other retailers have used and advertised as glass). It was very easy to fit and the kit provided has enough parts to keep in case the second protector is needed at a later date. I was initially concerned the fingerprint sensor wouldn't work but after increasing the screen sensitivity and reregistering my fingerprints it works perfectly. The lifetime warranty adds peace of mind, but I feel like I'll not need it as the quality is so good! I highly recommend this screen protector, it's the best I've ever had!I'm editing this review nearly a year later to say that the screen protector did its job very well when my phone fell and hit the edge of a bookcase - protector was unfortunately cracked but my screen was intact! The second protector lasted about 8-9 months before I noticed it had chipped and a hairline crack appeared - I can't say how it happened but I don't blame the quality of the protector. In fact I've still been using it for months after with no issues at all and I can barely see the crack!Editing this again because I've just had to purchase a replacement - I managed to drop my phone face down on stony tarmac and this protector saved my screen. The impact points shattered the protector but it stayed in place, no shards. Without it my phone screen would have been destroyed!!",

The only thing is that the fingerprint on Google Pixel 6 is on-screen, and this protector definitely dampens its scanning capabilities.

                "reviewText": "(I once again accidentally hit submit before finishing my review...)My previous screen protector reduced my phone's touch sensitivity and made the fingerprint reader inconsistent, so I ordered these ones instead.Great purchase! Touch sensitivity and fingerprint reader perform just as well as with a naked phone screen. I didn't even have to register my fingerprints again!It was easy to install and very forgiving when I had to make adjustments. With every generation of phones, LK has improved their installation process, instructions, and packaging.The curved edges are a nice touch, as the straight-edged one I had before would snag my fingers.The only downside is that the width of the screen protector is exactly the width of the OLED display. It would be nice if it covered a bit more of the glass beyond the display so as not to cause any visual distortion at the edges. I understand that this is intended to accomodate cases, but I have a case with a thick lip on this phone and there is plenty of room between the case and screen protector.I did not use the camera glass protector.TL;DR: I'm happy overall and will be buying LK protectors again in the future, but it would get 5 stars if it were just a little wider.",
