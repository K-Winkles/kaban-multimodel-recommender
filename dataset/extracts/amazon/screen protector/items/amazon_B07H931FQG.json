This screen protector is a real tempered glass.The plastic flexibily is the exact reason why we call it tempered glass screen protector. Tempered glass is a type of safety glass that is stronger than ordinary glass. 2. It cannot be seen from the appearance that it is glass or plastic. As a customer, what can we do to identify it? There is an easy, quick, cost-effective way to test it yourself, and it's very accurate. Most plastics have a melting point between 160 and 210 degrees Celsius, and glass materials are at least over 1400 degrees Celsius, so is there a lighter around? 3. Does it come with a cleaning wipe to use prior to placing on the phone? Yes,the package includes: 4*Guide Stickers, 2*Wet Wipe&2*Dry Wipe,2*Dust Absorber 4.How can I remove bubbles? Use the kit in the package to clean the screen before placing the screen protector.If there are bubbles, try to gently press the bubbles with your finger or with a ruler,but the screen surface needs a thin cloth pad to avoid scratching the protector. 5.How can I remove a cracked glass screen protector? Lift the screen protector with the card from any corner of the screen protector, then hold the corner and remove slowly. (If you find CHIP or CRACK on the screen protector, for your safety, please wear gloves when removing the screen protector.)",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Decent Privacy Screen with some downfalls",
                "reviewText": "Bought these to stop being paranoid while using my phone in public settings. The protector slightly dims the screen when viewed head on, but that\u2019s to be expected. It only has privacy technology when viewed from left or right, not up or down. I\u2019m dissatisfied with the range of privacy since I expected it to darken and conceal at a sooner angle than it actually does. If someone is directly next to you, they can still see your screen, it just looks a bit darker and they might not be able to make out any letters. If someone is beside you and a bit further away, then this screen does black out completely which is great. Again, I had higher expectations since this is my first privacy screen protector and I thought the screen would be dark unless you were directly in front of the phone which isn\u2019t the case.My biggest downfall is that it reduces the sensitivity of your phone screen. So I\u2019m having to tap harder in order for my touch to be recognized. This protector also smudges like no one\u2019s business. You can\u2019t see the smudges while you\u2019re using your phone directly, but they become visible when your screen is off or you tilt your phone to view the dark privacy protection working. Also, the edges of the screen protector collect a lot of dust/fuzz.Installation was also troublesome for me. I ended up needing to use both protectors since the first one became too dirty to use. It took me close to an hour to get the second one on since dust particles kept getting stuck to the sticky side and the protector leaves a bubble around them. I was applying them while in a clean room and I used all the stickers and wipes provided to clean everything, but it was no use. I\u2019ve never struggled to apply tempered glass protectors before so it was a bit frustrating. I am still using the protector since it does what it\u2019s supposed to (just not as well as I hoped), but once this breaks, I will be trying another brand.",

                "reviewText": "It came with 2 screen protectors, with it the wipes and dust absorber. It also has a QR code for installing the screen protector, but it\u2019s not needed the instructions are really easy to understand and really easy to install. The glass really is smooth and when I am using my phone the keyboard letters don\u2019t get stuck. As for the privacy as u can see the glass is black but if u truly want the privacy I suggest to lower the brightness halfway on the screen. Besides that it\u2019s good.",
