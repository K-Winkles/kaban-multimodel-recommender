It also doesn't have a hole in it for fingerprint recognition, but it still reads my fingerprint with zero problems. It's flexible, not hard plastic, or glass, and if you watch their installation video first, it's very easy to apply. (Video link is on the box.)I will buy this protector for every phone I have for the rest of my life. I can't say enough good things about it! (If I HAD to say something negative, it does show fingerprints after typing and swiping, but they come off easily with a soft cloth.) 10 stars!!!",

I threw it in the trash after several attempts. I had used LK before and decided to come back where I belong. It does the job, easy to install and works even with the round edge of the Samsung s22 ultra. The camera protector is also nice, doesn't hinder quality at all. One of the screen savers was bent but since there are 2, it was ok. Maybe they will send me a new one. Regardless, I still gave it a 5. I will never stray again! LK forever!",

The edges get caught and lifted by the case. Going to have to switch back to the thin sticker type ones unfortunately.",

This screen protector left me with neither! The directions in the video are so clear and it was so easy to do. Highly recommend this product!",
