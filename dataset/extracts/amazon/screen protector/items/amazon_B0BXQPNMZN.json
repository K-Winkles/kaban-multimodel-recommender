Very easy to install when following the instructions.If this screen protector gets cracked, it is very easy to remove, clean, and install another protector over the main top screen. This product comes in a sturdy case to make sure you can carry a spare with you while on the go and keep your phone screen protected.I prefer the 3-pack because you can order a replacement if you use the second one and still have a spare on hand while waiting for the additional protectors to arrive and offer continuous protection for your phone top screen.I highly recommend pairing this screen protector with a good phone case, for superior protection for everyday use. This screen protector is not interfered with using standard cases.",

                "reviewText": "First, they were packaged nicely, and the instructions were very straightforward. Second, applying the screen protectors was more challenging than expected.The main problem is how you apply the protectors and how easy it is for the Moto G Power 2023 to slide around when positioning the glass. When you open the package, you'll get a microfiber cloth, alcohol wipes, a dust collector, and three protective glasses. To apply these screen protectors, you will clean your phone screen, use the dust collector, and then apply stickers as the glass \"guide.\" You then attach the glass to the stickers and carefully lower it on the screen.It sounds easy enough, but here is the issue. The guide stickers don't guarantee a good screen alignment, and the Moto G Power will slide around as you try to position the glass and stick it to the stickers. Luckily, I got an acceptable alignment from two of the three protectors. I had two phones to protect as Christmas gifts to my family, and one wasted protector meant the pack got the job done.So overall, if you're careful, these will be all you need. So far, they are holding up on the phones nicely. If I can recommend something for Supershieldz, it is to ditch the sticker application and make a cheap reusable plastic phone holder/applicator. This will make the application process flawless. As long as your glass holds up, you could be the go-to brand for budget screen protectors.",

                "reviewText": "I've now put on 4 of these protectors, 1st, 3rd and 4th developed bubbles under the top edge/corners and the protector won't stay down. This is after a week+ of normal use, like maybe face oil is getting sucked into the adhesion layer. The 2nd protector fractured when my phone fell onto concrete but it did save the screen. I've never had a screen protector lift/bubble like this before.",
