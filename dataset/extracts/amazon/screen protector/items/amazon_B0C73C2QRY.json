The installation could not be any more easy. The finish is crispy clean and exact fit. This is the first privacy screen protector that has no bubbles, super clear look in any situation, strong hold, I forget I even have a privacy screen protector at times.

                "reviewText": "All in all, these screen protectors are very nice!! They include a tool that makes it so EASY to apply it onto your phone, and it mostly leaves no air bubbles between the screen and the protector. (They usually disappear by pushing it out with your thumbs or with time)The privacy feature is well made, the only thing I had a problem with was that it does dim the brightness by a significant tiny amount, but I also look at it as a plus since it can help reduce eye strain with bright displays! An extra note, the protector will have a sort of screen effect that will make it seem \u201cfuzzy\u201d for a lack of a better word due to how the privacy feature works. For me, it is no problem as it makes the screen seem \u201cvintage\u201d and does not effect screen resolution or clarity, BUT might be a downside for other people.It also comes with four protectors which will help when it will inevitably deteriorate or break, saves my wallet a little extra cash for when that happens.For the quality, quantity, and the price, this product is a must have if you are in the market for privacy screens, with some minor caveats. I give this product an 8.5/10. Would recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I installed the privacy screen protector this morning, and so far I have been really pleased. A solid three stars, and maybe 4 stars after a few days of use.First off, it was very easy to install. I had to take off my old screen protector, so there wasn't any dust, which is something that always seems to get caught under my screens. At first, I was a little disappointed, because there were bubbles. But as the screen protector has settled, they have already gone away. I also like that it hides the pre-existing scratches that are already on my phone, due to me neglecting to cover the screen right away. I also could not get rid of the bubble at the top. It took me a moment to realize it was a clear circle so that the camera would not be blocked. In other reviews there were complaints that the screen blocked face ID, so this could be the fix.Within a few minutes of having installed it, I noticed that at my current brightness level, which is not high, I could barely see the screen. If you read my headline, and scratched your head, this is what I mean by your battery may die faster. I had to turn the brightness way up so I could see. But like getting use to a new pair of glasses, it may just be my eyes need to adjust.My only other complaint is that the screen privacy only works is portrait mode. If you put the phone into landscape mode because you are playing a game, trying to see a webpage better, etc. keep in mind that if you are viewing something embarrassing, it probably will be seen in landscape mode.I bought this screen protector because I get tired of strangers looking over my shoulder when my phone is out. And if I am honest, people who always seem to be walking by my desk when I am taking a mental break do not need to see I am just playing a game. It just better be a game in portrait mode.",
