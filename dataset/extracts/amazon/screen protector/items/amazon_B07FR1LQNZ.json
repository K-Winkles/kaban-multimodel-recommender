                "reviewText": "UPDATE (22Oct20): It really protects your phone well. I dropped my phone recently face down onto a concrete pad from a height of around three feet. When I picked it up I felt sick: the phone face was covered with spider-web-like cracks. I peeled off the protector to find that the screen on my phone was completely unharmed. The screen protector absorbed all the damage.******************I spent a little more for this brand of screen protector and am glad I did. I've found in the past that, despite reading directions and following them carefully, sometimes when I install these something goes awry and I end up throwing one or two of the protector screens away.There's little chance of that happening with these. The protector shields come with a template frame that the phone snaps into; you place the top of the protector screen carefully between the edges of this frame and then the entire film fits into place easily. Unsnap the frame from around the phone and you're good to go. It's fairly foolproof (and I can be a fool doing this.) It took me less than three minutes to install this, from opening the box, reading the instructions, cleaning and drying the phone screen thoroughly, and applying the protector.I've never found a protector so easy to install. No air bubble troubles at all. It protects the screen well, with no glare problems, and leaves a small space (~1/8\" or ~ 3 mm) between the edge of the protector and edge of the phone. I use an Otterbox case to protect the phone. It fit easily back into that afterward.I'll buy this brand again without hesitation. It's worth spending a bit more virtually to eliminate the chance that I'll waste one or two of the protector screens via installing them incorrectly. I'm a very satisfied customer.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: Well, it looks like I spoke too soon. It's only been about 1-2 months since I applied the first screen protector, and it cracked when I dropped it in the gym. I don't think it actually hit anything other than the rubberized floor, but it looked like it did hit something that impacted the side of the protector and caused a crack that went all the way across (See photo). My previous iPhone glass protector (older phone) went 2-3 years before the first crack showed up, after dropping numerous times. Good thing this package comes with 3 screen protectors. I had quite a bit of trouble applying the second protector-- it was difficult to make sure no dust was trapped under the glass, and I ended up removing and reapplying 3-4 times before I was successful. One problem: Now the protector shows where I pried it off, I guess my finger or nail rubbed off some of the adhesive. (See photo).Ultimately, still a good value, which is why I am leaving the rating at 5 stars, but be aware it's a bit more fragile than other products may be, although I have no idea which ones are the higher quality ones vs. lesser.-----Some of the reviews mentioned that the glass protector cracked shortly after installation, so we will see if that happens, but so far no issues. Super easy to install given the alignment framing tool, much easier than previous alignment sticker solutions. I was able to install on the first try without bubbles or lint under the screen, and it was pretty much a perfect fit and centered just right. It doesn't go all the way to the edge, but I have a case on the phone so that's actually a good thing so it doesn't interfere with the case. Already have dropped the phone a couple times with no hint of damage to the protector.",

                "reviewText": "I typically don't write reviews for products, but WOW this one just really blew me away!I bought this product at the end of 2019 when I bought my iPhone 11. As many others have said, the frame that comes with the screen protectors makes installing the protectors an absolute breeze. However, the thing that really stuck out to me was the attention to detail this company made with making sure the entire user experience was as smooth as possible. After using my phone for a little bit longer than a year, I finally managed to drop it so that the screen protector cracked. It did its job, not leaving so much as even a dent on the actual screen underneath. Then I got the kit from out of storage and prepared to replace the screen, and that's when I realized how much I appreciated the product. So much so that I had to write a review about it after a year since I bought it.A few things to note about the replacement process that I just love:-The instructions are in proper English with visual diagrams to walk you through the process. With so many Chinese products out on the market today, it is such a relief to read instructions without having to sift through countless grammatical errors.-The kit not only includes a screen protector and guiding frame, it also has wet wipes, dry wipes, even a dust absorber sticker in order to make sure that your screen can be completely clean before you stick the screen protector on it, what fantastic additions-There are three sets of everything! Wet wipes, dry wipes, dust absorber stickers, screen protectors, the kit is equipped so that you can have three solid and individually completed screen protector installationsFor its price point, this kit just can't be beat. I would absolutely recommend this product, and will certainly buy again in the future when the need arises. Hopefully they don't change the layout of this wonderful kit anytime soon!",
