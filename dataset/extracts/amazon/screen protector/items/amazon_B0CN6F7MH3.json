I always have problems installing these types of protectors without a speck of dust left on the screen or air bubbles that I can't remove, so it's good that the package includes 3 protectors because I wrecked one. This package didn't include instructions, which is unusual for a TQLGY product, but I found guidelines on the internet.",
