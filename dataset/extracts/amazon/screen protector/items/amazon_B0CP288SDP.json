The finger print on the screen gives me problems even with he solution they provided, however I feel this is a bad design by Samsung because all the phones I have had with the print on the screen have given me issues. The glass was easy to install on my screen, it does have the privacy look at the 20 degree angle. Customer service is great for this product they sent me information before my glass arrived to verify I had the correct phone and didn\u2019t make a mistake, they also told me how to deal with the print issue by adjusting my settings.Again great product and great customer service I would definitely buy this product again from this company.",

                "reviewText": "The S24 Ultra stylus was the reason I got this phone, but unfortunately does not work with this screen protector. It comes and goes, so attempting to draw a line will result in dashes, and cropping a selection on screen will mean stopping the marquee too soon, and being unable to accurately select a rectangle of the desired dimensions.The privacy part is good, good brightness remains, but unfortunately the screen sensitivity issues make this unusable.Most of the reviews mention fingerprint sensitivity which did go down as expected, but it was bearable after increasing the sensitivity setting and adding my fingerprints again after installing the protector.My last issue is with the vendor: they spammed me a \"support message\" before I even got the item, with a disclaimer clarifying what I had purchased and that if it was the wrong item I should go through them to replace it. It seemed sneaky and unnecessary.",

The down side is the fingerprint biometrics are a bit hit or miss even after re-registering my fingerprints with the screen protector on.

                "reviewText": "I have been putting on screen protectors since I worked in the cellular industry so for over 20 years. This was the easiest one to install because they give you a guide to put on the phone. There is no way that you can mess this up. Yes the fingerprint sensor could be better but they tell you in the instructions that you need to re-record your fingerprint after the screen protector is on so this cuts down on a lot of misreads. People are probably not following the instructions. For the money, one of the best",

It comes with a guide or template that snaps onto the phone and makes placing the screen protector perfect the first time so easy. No bubbles, no weird light spots and it feels pretty durable. This is just a great product overall.",

                "reviewText": "The screen protector I purchased approximately two weeks ago has already developed a crack. While the installation process was straightforward, the product did not meet my expectations in several areas. Despite claims of being bubble-free, multiple bubbles were present upon application on a brand-new Galaxy S24 Ultra. Additionally, the placement of the word \"glass\" on the side that adheres to the phone is visible under certain lighting conditions, which is aesthetically unappealing. Furthermore, the screen protector does not effectively conceal the screen's contents, making it less effective in terms of privacy. In comparison, the Galaxy S23 Ultra screen protector offered superior performance in these aspects.",

It's easy to install (I think this is the first screen protector I installed that I didn't have to fight with the bubbles under the screen).Even though I set my fingerprint with the screen protector on, it usually takes 2 - 3 tries to unlock the phone. This may be user error, but it was so annoying that I turned off the fingerprint scan to open my phone.The privacy protection function works really well. It isn't so sensitive that it's hard to play games on your phone, but it does help with prying eyes from others around you.Highly recommend this product.",
