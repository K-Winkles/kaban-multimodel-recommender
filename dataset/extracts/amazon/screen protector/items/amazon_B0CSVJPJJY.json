The tough screen is not interfered with and the finger print sensor works perfectly. I highly recommend this protector for your phone screen. Absolutely the best.",

I usually go with tempered glass, but chose not to due to the 24 Ultra having antiglare glass.The good:Application was simple and effective. Followed instructions and had zero issues and zero bubbles. After applying, I set a timer for 30 minutes and let it sit.The protector is crystal clear and doesn't interfere with touch functions at all. I didn't even have to re-register my fingerprints.The bad:My only gripe is that the protector does not cover the whole screen. There's a pretty noticeable gap all around the screen that is unprotected. If you're not looking for tempered glass, this would be a perfect 5/5 if not for the gaps.",

Watch out for this...When it comes to the item itself, Its good, they all good. Easy to install and keeps the screen clean, its not meant to protect your screen from cracking / falls, its just meant to protect the screen from scratches. Just make sure you get the correct item...",
