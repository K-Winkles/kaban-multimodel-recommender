This helps to prevent protector from overlaying these curved edge which can lead to unwanted bubbles or peeling up around the edges. Durable and scratch resistant screen protector offers your phone protection against scratches, bumps, drops, and daily wear and tear. Easy to install screen protector allows for complete touchscreen sensitive, you won\u2019t even know it\u2019s there! Clean the phone screen thoroughly using the wet & dry wipes before installation. Peel off the protective layer (with tab) from the screen protector before applying to the phone. If air bubbles are present, use squeegee or hard card to push bubble from the center away to the edge of the phone screen. The curved-edge design is made smaller than the screen size of your device to ensure unwanted peeling or bubbling appear around edges.",

                "reviewText": "Trianium delivers a functional and practical screen protector for the iPhone XS Max. I've had the pleasure of owning several Trianium brand screen protectors, and not one screen has cracked from a fall. In everyday usage, these protectors are great at saving your screen from a replacement. In my experience it has taken several forceful falls before needing a replacement. One screen protector lasts me between 3-4 months. I appreciate the typical Trianium packaging--these screen protectors come in cases of three. More protectors per order means fewer times I need to reorder. For their price, these screen protectors are a great lesser-known brand that will protect your phone without paying leading brand prices. There are clear and simple instructions on how to install these, leaving few to no air bubbles on your phone. Although I'm sure my phone is already adequately protected, a slightly thicker glass may put my mind at greater ease. I recommend checking these screen protectors out if you need a durable screen protector for everyday use (minor falls and slip-ups) without overspending on a glass protector.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly bets screen protector ever. I just got the XS MAX. I never buy stuff for phone in the store cause way over priced but cause this phone was all glass I did buy an expensive case at the store for $45 which I could bought same thing on here for $10 but I work with phone in pocket so I bought the case I didn\u2019t wanna spend another $50.00 on a screen protector so I came to amazonThis one has the best reviews one I liked best was the one that said he stinks at putting them on and felt like a pro again this is an awesome deal for what you get and it was so easy to put on I would normally buy a screen protector and have to reapply or like 5 times cause it was uneven and bubbles to the point it didn\u2019t stink. I really bought this one cause it was a 3 pack so I figured if I messed up I had more chances but honestly the installation frame was amazing you take the case off if you have one you clip this on and it lined up everything perfect and went on amazing and no bubbles and I love it!!! Ale screen protectors make it hard to use the phone and can make it feel thick but this one feels like it\u2019s not on and now it have 2 more if anything happens and I\u2019ll always keep the installation frame so worth the money sorry can\u2019t add pictures with or on but it\u2019s so goodWill say already dropped phone and it\u2019s amazing",
