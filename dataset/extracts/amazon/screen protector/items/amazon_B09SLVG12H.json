Even looking straight at the screen say like at a football game, stadium seats. If someone is close behind you all you do is tilt the screen slightly forward or to the side by 1/2-1 inch and they can\u2019t see anything but a pink glow!Excellent best product I\u2019ve ever found to protect the screen, privacy, easy to apply, lasts, pretty pink glow comes from it.Highly recommend it. I buy them three or so at a time if I\u2019m working in the field, a more aggressive environment for a phone screen, it hasn\u2019t scratched but I dropped it on a rock and the screen got a small spider crack. It hasn\u2019t ever shattered and never had pieces come off, it stays together. Super durable you\u2019d have to really beat it down to crack it.",

                "reviewText": "First order got here right on time but the screen protect was cracked in a few places. So I reached out to the seller and they were very quick to respond back. I sent them a picture of the screen and they said they\u2019d replace it. The sent another message stating it was sent, gave me a tracking number, and even sent me two! 100/10 stars for customer service for sure.Now the screen protector itself: it\u2019s nice. Definitely provides a better level of privacy than the black ones in my opinion. Plus it makes the screen look cool because it\u2019s green or red/pink, depending on the angle. Install was easy. Only major drawback is the touchscreen is slightly less sensitive, but that\u2019s with any screen protector.",

                "reviewText": "1) This doesn\u2019t offer very good privacy compared to similar, black tinted privacy screens.2) It degrades the image quality through both a screen door effect, dimmed lighting, as well as terrible glare and a coating that really makes fingerprints stand out.3) The adhesive was pretty poorly applied. With some pressure and a little heat I got it to fully adhere, but I think the quality control here will cause bubbles for a lot of people, as well as corners lifting up prematurely.4) It fit my iphone 13 mini perfectly, but it\u2019s much thicker than most protectors, so I actually had to sand down a bit of my otter box phone case. Some may have some case compatibility issues due to the thickness. The base phone screen feels well protected at least.Overall: Not worth the money. Looks cool, but after the novelty wore off, the glare covered, fingerprint magnet screen made the phone less enjoyable to use overall. Battery health also was lowered due to brightness needing to be turned up to compensate for being harder to see, especially when outdoors.",
