                "reviewText": "On Amazon I looked at all of the watch face protectors for the Apple Series 7, and all of the reviews. I will break this product down cut and dry and honest. First, they were one of the least expensive. With that and the fact that they come in a pack of 6 I wasn\u2019t expecting good results and got the 6 pack because if there were bubbles, they didn\u2019t go on straight or adhere, I could start over. I have had bad luck with tempered glass phone screen protectors and expected the watch to be the same way. If you scan the QR code there is an instructional video. Use it because there is a simple but step by step process to this. The kit has everything you need even a non slip rubber base to hold the watch in place on the table. It is not tempered glass but a film. I applied it on my first try and it was 100% perfect. I took my time and made sure it was on the watch face straight and made adjustments to get it perfect. I then followed the steps to remove the backing and apply it. When I was finished there were NO bubbles, the edges all around had adhered with no peeled edges or air pockets and I could not tell it was on my watch. I read reviews where people stated that it didn\u2019t cover the entire face and left a small gap between the watch face and metal frame. This is true but the gap is small, and I can not see a line with my eye even in a well lit room. I can slightly feel it with my finger nail. The Series 7 watch face is not flat, as you know. This screen protector adheres to where the face starts to round off and does cover the rounded corners without a crease. It fits perfectly. I wear my watch 24/7 except for an hour to charge. I also bump into things and the reason I bought this protector was because I had a few tiny scratches and one that I could feel with my finger nail. This protector is \u201cself healing\u201d so it will cover and hide tiny scratches. I can not see mine. The small scratch that I could feel with my finger nail is still visible if I look for it. I really had to look for it to begin with and it was probably there for a while before I noticed it and bought these protectors. I have had this protector on my watch face for a few weeks and it is still flawless. I don\u2019t wear my watch in the shower because it has a Velcro band, so it hasn\u2019t been under water. There are no scratches on the film screen protector and I still can\u2019t tell it is on the watch. Here\u2019s what seals the deal\u2026when I put the protector on my watch I also did my wife\u2019s Series 7. It is perfect and went on flawlessly the first try. She is a nurse and wanted one because she bumped into the metal rail on a stretcher and was sure that her face was scratched, but it wasn\u2019t. Apple says that the Series 7 has a harder scratch resistant face than the Series 6 and leads you to believe that it will never scratch and they even have a fancy name for the face material that I forgot. This is false. It will scratch because mine did but just a little. I will end this by saying that our watches were $449 each, financed through the Apple Store for 24 months. I got mine in December and in 4 months had a few small micro scratches and the one that I noticed. It has to last 24 months at least. Apple Warranty does not cover cosmetic damage and when I called Apple they gave me a quote of $300 to put a new face on it, because I said they it was advertised as scratch resistant. In the end I was able to preserve the condition of 2 watches for about $6. If I do scratch the film working on my boat engine or installing cabinets etc. which are examples of what I did wearing the watch before I still have 4 more screen protectors in my closet! These watches are a big investment and I should have purchased these screen protectors when I got the watches. My advice is to ignore any review less than 5 stars because I am very picky and critical and not the best at applying screen protectors. Some people say that they are not great if you use a case for your watch, but I think those are tacky anyhow and like the smooth, sleek, contour look of my green Series 7 with green and black band. I suppose they like a case to protect the colored metal part of the watch which I can\u2019t see ever bumping or damaging. I highly recommend this product, they go on great, and are invisible\u2026plus you have back ups on hand if you ever scratch one. I would buy this product again and it works perfectly for my wife and I. Thanks for reading all of that I wanted to be thorough and share my views on the watch, it\u2019s cost and replacement face from Apple, and this product for it.",

VERY helpful.Quality:No notable distortion, No noticeable affect on vividness, Did not affect touchscreen function in any direction, Feels smooth.This thin thermoplastic polyurethane material is somewhat flexible and has the feel of glass.*life warranty registration available for this product (QR code on box for registry and details)Additional informationI can\u2019t rate durability but will update if this product does not perform well. 5/5 for now.Additional Information:I bought this with a new watch case and wristband combo. Less than one minute after installing the screen protector, I set the watch into the very tight case. The screen protector was not affected in any way and remained secure.",

                "reviewText": "These screen protectors are very good. The packaging felt very nice, and I was very surprised by how easy they were to apply. It didn't take any effort or concentration to get mine straight and centered. I've had mine for about 2 weeks and it still looks brand new. Minimal scratches and no bubbling or peeling. The other people here who are complaining that they need to change it every week must be wearing their Apple watch in an active war zone or something. Properly applied and with normal use, it should last at least a month if not more. It also doesn\u2019t diminish touch sensitivity.There are only two downsides. First, there is a slight lip that you can feel when you touch the edges of your screen.More importantly, it feels tackier than the original glass screen. Fingerprints show up way worse, and my fingers don\u2019t glide over the screen the way they do without a screen protector.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased these screen protectors for my Apple watch 9 to use along with an Otterbox Exo bumper. I think between the two, my watch will have added protection from falls or other mishaps.Good instructions were provided with the screen protector product, and the screen protector seems to stay in place. It did raise up a bit when I the bumped back on, but I was able to get it back in place. It was super easy to apply especially with some video instructions I found by pointing my phone at a QR code on the pkg. Everything needed is supplied in the box. These seem to be a favorite among people who post on forums with questions about their Apple watch and recommendations for cases, screen protectors, bands, etc.I do wish I could find a tempered glass one like this though. Since I have a raised bumper, though, I am not as concerned that this is a film vs glass. It will provide protection against scratches. I don't notice any loss of sensitivity in using this film vs no film. It fits so well, I really can't tell I have it on the watch either.I could only find these on Amazon. Price was reasonable, shipping was free, and product was as described. Overall good value! I was happy to find these.",
