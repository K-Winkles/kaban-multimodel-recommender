This product comes with a plastic tool that helps you align the screen protector perfectly, DO NOT throw it away because the replacement they send using your warranty does not come with one. I didn\u2019t have it even at first so I took it off and applied it again I much have touched the adhesive because now I have a bubble on a corner of my screen. So keep the tool this comes with or you\u2019ll be sorry.I use ZAGG because of the lifetime warranty. Your screen protector will eventually crack or chip so it\u2019s pretty much necessary. I was about to purchase this off their website and found it wayyyy cheaper on Amazon. Installation was easy, love the plastic piece that helps you align the protector perfectly. Make sure you push the bubbles out and if you\u2019re left with air at the ends it\u2019s probably just air under the top layer. Peel the top layer off and there you go!",
