                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve used so many different type of screen protectors in my life. Starting from the iPhone 5 all the way up now to the iPhone 15 Pro. I\u2019ve also had screen protectors for my Samsung galaxy S 21 ultra. I\u2019ve never had a screen protector look this good, and also have a protector for the top Speaker. I also have the Apple clear phone case and it fits perfectly. I understand some cases are different, but in my use case, it\u2019s very case friendly The installation was incredibly easy. I did skip one step because I knew it would put dust under the screen. I believe the step was step two I just removed the film and put it on the screen and had no issues. It did have air bubbles but they are incredibly easy to get out and I don\u2019t see anymore. The finish doesn\u2019t look like I have screen protector on. For the price and how many you get I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a better deal that you can get. This is not a bot either. I\u2019m a real person to prove that a real person Max Verstappen won the drivers championship by over, doubled of person that came in second place. Just buy the screen protector.",

                "reviewText": "Other than the tight fit, 5 stars. Super easy to install, great feel, great clarity, and even taking it out of your pocket wipes the fingerprints away. My only (and minimal) issue is that it doesn't work with all cases. I tried the Spigen Enzo Aramid and the Spigen Magnetic Ultra Hybrid (Frosted Clear) and each of those cases lift the protector away from the screen. I tried putting a new protector on, thinking I misaligned, but it still lifted the protector, just from the top now instead of the bottom.It works well with my Mous case and the ESR Tough case. No lifting there. Overall great protection and feel, would be perfect if the protector was just a hair smaller.",

Great price, Amazon did good on this one. This also came from China again trying to boycott them but it seems like everything I touch is made in China. It would be nice to see some American products on the Amazon list of things I would rather Shop American any day in anytime , keep America strong Amazon buy more from America. Make us proud of you. We don\u2019t need things from China that are poorly made but this glass was perfect and very affordable.",

After cleaning my screen it was as easy as just removing the film from the one side and laying down on the alignment piece. Pressed for a few secs and I was done. Just watch to make sure all air bubbles are out. They give you all the tools you will need to put it on. Plus you get a couple extra screen protectors and you always have the alignment tool.",
