After easily yanking the old screen protector off, I turned my phone off and went to town on the whole phone with the provided alcohol wipe, then cleaned the screen as instructed with the low lint cloth. After a quick alignment by eye, I peeled and put one protector sticky side down. It doesn't go up to the edges of the screen, which means I can fit a variety of cases onto my S21. I used the low lint cloth to rub out bubbles. All touch screen functions work on my S21 and my phone looks brand new again with a new case.",

It leaves a little too much room around the edge of the phone, but that's about where a case pulls over so the margin really is small enough to where I don't worry about it. I will gladly keep buying these over those stupid flexible zagg ones simply for how these feel. These ones keep the true glass feeling while the zagg ones just feel like what they are: plastic. These are really smooth and I love it. The adhesive is also really nice. Got a hair stick under the screen and it stuck back down perfectly after pulling it up to remove the hair.",

                "reviewText": "See the photo - it shows what the front of my S21 phone looked like after it was lost on a main road in a small town. Too embarrassing to tell how it became \"lost\" on a road, suffice it to say that it was face down at the edge of a traffic lane for over 40 minutes. Google \"find my device\" helped me find it (perfect location accuracy - I was amazed). Many tire tracks across the backside of the phone when I picked it up, and the photo shows what looks like a completely damaged screen on the front. It had been repeatedly pressed down into the fairly coarse pavement with I'm sure lots and lots of weight, many times.Long story short: I removed the screen protector and found zero damage to the S21 screen. Absolutely nothing - it was (and still is) in perfect as-new condition. I can't imagine how the sharp points of the rough pavement didn't penetrate the screen protector, but it performed amazingly well and completely protected my screen under extreme conditions.I have a low profile case protector as well, which I'm sure helped (will leave separate review for that), but this screen protector is fantastic and the only brand I will ever use.On a side note - it seems to degrade the S21 fingerprint detector just a bit, but if I occasionally refresh the fingerprints the phone detects reliably and I'm happy with its performance in this respect.Thank you Supershieldz!",

Unfortunately, with my 24 ultra, the sensor won't recognize at all.The fit could go a little farther to the bezel in my opinion. If I swipe from the sides, I can definitely feel the edges catch. The top and bottom is fine, but the left to right is a little narrow.The glass is super smooth and clear though.Going to have to try something else because I need to fingerprint ability.",

These always provide great scratch protection for the screens leaving them like new years later if kept covered with these.Adheres nicely with no remaining bubbles.Unfortunately, the glass screen protector is the exact size of the lit screen area, so if you don't apply perfectly straight, small areas of the screen are not covered and there's no alignment device.The fingerprint sensor will NOT work, it won't even take fingerprints with this glass screen protector applied.S-pen will not always register as having touched the screen with this applied.",
