I see now that they have a LIFETIME warranty so probably could have gotton a free replacement. I am again very happy with the product I received.Once you have had a GLASS screen protector you will never go back to film. They are so easy and forgiving to apply and so CLEAR. Installation was a breeze. Yes it only sticks to the edge but that prevents the DREADED speck of dust under a flexible film protector that sticks everywhere! No problems with the case. My previous ones had cracked when I dropped my phone and it landed face down. But I'd much rather have a cheap protector bust then my screen. It's just what happens with a GLASS screen protector - all brands can break. But a glass protector is so CLEAR and EASY to apply you won't care if you have an accident.",

                "reviewText": "So to make this clear my fianc\u00e9 works in IT and anything to do with electronics so logically I asked him to install this on my phone for me. Not only did he have to come and ask if I was sure I still wanted him to installing after he noticef that the only part that had any sort of adhesive was ago around the edges of the side facing the phone which was just poor quality but showed me how towards the center of the screen protector it didn't actually make contact with the phone screen itself but it was way shorter than they claimed to be. Well I didn't like going without one so I told him to just go ahead and put it on for me but here is where I just don't get it. The first time I dropped my phone on my carpet and from a relatively short height it simply came off of the phone and it was literally less than 24hours from when I had put it on my phone. Now ive had phone screens installed on my phone by my fianc\u00e9 many times throughout the years and this was the first time this has ever happened. This is where I messed up. Due to me having to look after my kids who just happened to get covid one after another as one kid was getting better the next would be getting sick so I hadn't had the chance to look into my order or even try it out right away but by the time I finally got around to it and could actully try the things out and see that I indeed needed to request to have them returned, it was too late for me to ruturn or exchange for something new and I was stuck with it and this wasn't the only thing that I was stuck with in fact 2 other things on my order were needing to be replaced with a new one that would work better or that wasn't defective but again I was stuck with it and what was worse is that I bought 2 packs of 2 of this and now regret it. Oh well. Lessons learned.",

                "reviewText": "Just installed it today. I'm curious to see if I will feel the same way in a month, but so far, I'm very impressed.I invested in this this product on the recommendation of a popular YouTube reviewer after personally having gone through 3-4 cheaper products, and it appears it was worth paying a bit more for the quality. The Supershieldz protector is full coverage and fits the curved edges of my LG G8 phone perfectly, looks great, is very responsive to both taps and swipes when typing, and provided you watch and carefully follow the installation video provided (a link to the YouTube video is included in the box) the protector is a BREEZE to install. I cannot emphasize enough how helpful the video was and how important it is that you follow it when installing (make sure to watch the one for Tempered Glass). TRUST ME, put in the extra time so you can save the second protector as a replacement in case the first one cracks, instead of wasting it as a backup after you've screwed up the first application because you rushed!Very happy so far. I'll update this review in a month's time if anything changes for the worse.",

                "reviewText": "Just installed my SuperShieldz protector. This is by far the best fit of a screen protector I have had for the LG G8 Thin Q. have not given it a 5 start rating as I want to see if it stays on. Last glass protector I had popped off with the slightest bump. I installed it with my case on and it actually provided a perfect guide for centering the protector. I did clean it with 99.9 isopropyl alcohol. I wanted it to be as stuck on as possible. I am sure their 70% swab would be just as good. I installed it completely dust free and I did not use any of the sticky guides or dust sticker provided. If this stays on for at least 3 months I will be happy.Update: so this is by far the best protector I have tried. Dropped it a few times. Once just short of going down the stairs. Heart skipped a beat on that one. Protector seems to hold fast on all the bumps so far. I have ordered another pack just because I like it that much. No regrets.",
