                "reviewText": "I am now on my 3rd time buying this 2 pack - I have two iPhone 12s in the family. I love this screen protector for two reasons. First, it does its job. It feels exactly like I am using the regular screen glass - no stickiness, no indication that I am interacting with anything other than the actual screen. It takes the beating that my screen doesn't. It doesn't get scratches or swirls from my keys or other things in my pocket - the little stuff doesn't bother it, but when that big hit comes (dropped on gravel, pressed onto a sharp object, fall on the hardwoods or concrete) the screen protector takes the crack or chip, and my screen doesn't. I am perfectly happy for this to get a small crack or chip after a hard fall - that's what its for.Secondly, it has a simple and flawless application process. The guide bracket means perfect placement, the fit is exactly right, the method of application is straightforward - its dead simple to get a perfect application. I have now applied this protector 6 times across the two phones - we are not always kind to our devices, but our screens are perfect because these protectors have taken the fall without sacrificing any usability or experience. 10 out of 10 - will probably buy again.",

                "reviewText": "TLDR; No muss, no fuss. Super easy application, no dust specks, excellent coverage.I am *very* particular with my screen protectors. I always have one on my phone, and I always end up cracking it, so you can imagine I've gone through quite a few screen protectors over the years. Without a doubt, this screen protector is the best I have ever put on my phone.This screen protector pack comes with two screen protectors on applicator frames, two dust removal sticker sets, two alcohol swabs, and a little glass cleaning cloth.How it works: You clean the phone with the provided cleaning products (pretty standard to any good screen protector). You remove the backing on the glass, which is connetcted to the frame applicator. You set the applicator frame down on your phone (no wiggling required). You remove the applicator and the protective layer on the glass. Done. It took me maybe five minutes.PROS:First: The application is incredibly easy. You clean your phone, take off the back cover, and settle it on. The physically attached frame applicator tool is sized perfectly to the phone. You don't have to wiggle it or hope that the screen protector falls within the frame, you can just take off the backing and put it down. This is *revolutionary*.Second: There are no dust specks. None! I usually have at least one tiny little air bubble with the tiniest fleck of matter inside, sitting there, mocking me, but there wasn't a single fleck on my screen. I am very, very particular about this. I have inspected this phone. No dust.Finally: It just covers the screen super well. Excellent coverage means less worry of something cracking the edge of my screen. There is only the smallest bit of screen showing on the side. Nothing that would impair a case, I think (the one I have on it now has a bit of a lip and fits perfectly well), but definitely enough to protect the phone.CONS:First: They don't give much instruction on how to clean the phone for application. This is something that is usually included in screen protector packs; the standard order is to clean the screen with the alcohol wipe, then wipe away any smears with a good glass cloth, then use the dust stickers to make sure there are no particles on the bare screen to be trapped when the protector is placed. But the provided instructions do not tell you this. There was a QR code with a video link provided, which might tell you this, but I hate watching instructional videos, so I'm not sure what's in it.Second: The glass cleaner wipe is not good. I had to wipe off the phone screen again after wiping with it. Not ideal, but I literally just used the hem of my dress and it came out perfect, so I'm not too fussed.Finally: There is the slightest hint of a glimmer of a waver to the screen. I can barely see it, even if I squint and tilt my phone, but for people who really care about that, there you go. I will, however, say that this is the best-looking screen protector that I have ever had my possession.I will be buying this screen protector until they stop selling it (or stop their quality control).",

It\u2019s very simple to apply, I\u2019ve never had any bubbles or dust underneath (follow instructions and use the dust sticker) and this lasts a long time. With the cheaper ones, as soon as you crack the protecter, it\u2019s starts coming off. Not this one, you can have multiple cracks and it will stay in place. Have finally replaced it after 12 months and it\u2019s as good as new! Can\u2019t express how happy I am with it.",

                "reviewText": "The Spigen glass screen protector is a great addition to protecting my investment. When I purchased it for my iPhone 11\u201d, the first screen went on without a hitch. I still had an extra, just in case I needed to replace it. When I decided to trade in my 11\u201d for the iPhone 12\u201d, I found the screen easy to remove and was amazed how it kept my 11\u201d screen in pristine condition. The phone I traded in, looked brand new as I purchased it. After receiving my iPhone 12\u201d, I decided to purchase the Spigen again. I went through the same process of installing on my new phone, as I did on the previous one. The problem was, there was a defect in the first screen, that I had to throw it away. So glad there was a second screen available, and I was hoping no defects. Thankfully, the second one was flawless. The other thing I noticed, was the notch. It was smaller on this screen compared to the one I had for the 11\u201d. I decided to keep it on since despite the notch size, the rest of the screen looks great, and I like have protection to keep my screen in as new condition, just in case I want to do another trade in. I like the Spigen brand because it is functional and I like the ease of installing. I would continue to recommend this product!",
