                "reviewText": "ProofTech has undoubtedly raised the bar with its TWIST PEN Liquid Glass Screen Protector. It's a game-changer in the realm of device protection! The brush-on application process is seamless, ensuring even coverage for any device, be it phones, tablets, or smartwatches. Since applying, I've noticed my devices resist scratches and cracks far better than with traditional protectors. The nano protection technology not only sounds futuristic but genuinely delivers on its promises. A universal solution that's both efficient and effective - a must-have for tech enthusiasts! Highly recommended.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this product to use on an older iPad that my child uses, wanting to have a little extra protection for the screen in addition to a screen protector. I followed the instructions, though they are vague where it comes to the application. Do I twist the cap clockwise or counter-clockwise? Clockwise just clicked. Counter-clockwise seemed to hit resistance. I'm assuming the idea is like operating a tube of chapstick or glue, that when you rotate the cap it puts pressure on the liquid to come out of the brush. Well that never really happened for me. It did a few large drops of liquid, but really the brush was almost dry the whole time. I attempted the application anyway, but like the other reviewed mentioned, it just left a lot of streaks on the iPad, and after an hour I cleaned the streaks away and want to move on without this product. The internal mechanism that the twist top engages with broke, so that might be part of the problem, so if that's the case, I think the manufacturer has some quality control work to do with this product. I did not reach out to the manufacturer to ask for a replacement because even with the little bit of application I attempted, I am not convinced this product performs as advertised. I did reach out to Amazon for a refund because the product broke, so I have initiated the return process. Feedback for manufacturer: better instructions, application videos so we know what the application process should look like... are we dry-brushing this product on, or is it supposed to be coated in liquid?",
