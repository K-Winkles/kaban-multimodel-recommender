                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great product",
                "reviewText": "This is an excellent screen protector. It is a thin layer of glass and while I haven't thrown rocks at my iPhone's screen or dropped the device from the second floor to see how strong and effective it is from that perspective, but I can say it goes on really smoothly and without any hassle, it definitely reduces the glare, and it doesn't interfere with the touch screen functionality.The plastic sleeve that the screen protector comes in is a great tool to ensure that the screen protector goes on the device's screen precisely the first time and without messy multiple attempts to line up everything. It often feels like to install these screen protectors successfully, you need to be equipped with a clean room fit for computer chip manufacturing but this screen protection system manages to make it quite painless to attach your screen protection. The wet wipe, dry wipe, microfiber cloth, and particle remover sheet which come in the package do an outstanding job of ensuring that no particulate matter remains on the device's screen prior to mounting the screen protector. And as installation instructions explain, if there is a bubble after the installation, just lift up a corner of the newly installed screen protector until it lets out the bubble, re-press down the glass and you will end up with a pristine, clean, and clear screen. There are no annoying bubbles, particulate dark spots or streaks, or misalignment issues left to deal with. And now you have an extra layer of screen protection for your expensive device.The package also includes a lens protection shield for the phone's camera lenses which also goes on pretty easily and provides effective protection for the camera's lenses by covering them up with an extra layer of glass.All in all this item seems like a really useful protection for your $1,100+ phone at a pretty reasonable cost.",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s a solid 10/10 to install, it goes on great and I managed to get it absolutely perfect on my second try. I would recommend doing it in a clean space with little dust like your bathroom with very little clothing on.The camera guard didn\u2019t really like to go on quite perfect, no matter what you\u2019re gonna have dust underneath and it will bubble at the corners but it still provides good protection and the camera lens is clear.My biggest complaint is that it just attracts dust like a magnet. Before screen protector, my phone if I rubbed it on my sleeve or pant leg it would come away spotless. Now when I rub it on a sleeve or pant leg it comes away covered in dust and hairs from my animals. Fingerprints stick to this glass like a magnet and the glass feels less\u2026 slick than an iPhone glass screen. I\u2019m going to look into products I can spray on and wipe into this glass to get a slicker feel and get rid of that dust. I\u2019m happy with the product though and I would buy it again. Maybe next time I\u2019ll buy something of very high quality that is advertised for the slick feel of a real screen.EDIT: I\u2019ve used this for a week or two now and I realized I was too critical of the coating. The glass is flexible and durable but when it shatters it will shatter into very tiny pieces of powdery crystal (I broke one of them intentionally to see). It appears I was wrong about how the coating attracts dirt and grit, it seems to perform very well now and maybe it was just the pants I happened to be wearing that day.The camera cover is either difficult to install correctly or just sucks. I\u2019ve left mine on but it has bubbling at the edges still.Edit: six months later, both the screen protector and camera covering are cracked. I am brutal on my things and they cracked instead of my phone screen cracking so I\u2019m pretty happy. I\u2019d buy these again once I\u2019m sick of the cracks on the originals. They took the damage so my phone didn\u2019t have to",

In the past I found it easier to use one that came with a frame to help guide you in installing the protector. The frame helped, but I still had bubbles and unevenness. Until I tried this amFilm protector. The installation was seamless and very easy, and it looks perfect. I even had to check to make sure there really was a screen protector on my phone.",
