                "reviewText": "I must have tried like 10 different brands of glass protectors and they seemingly all are \u201cunbreakable\u201d. No, they are not. Everyone I\u2019ve used has cracked in a million pieces. I was so frustrated with paying for screen repairs that I told myself I\u2019d have to just buy a flip phone/non smart phone because I\u2019m too clumsy for anything with iphone glass. I eventually got one one of those heavy duty Otterbox-like cases that has a front cover. Even that one when i dropped it, although the screen didnt crack, it gave me that green vertical line. Plus, the thing makes your phone feel like holding a gameboy.Once I had the green line, I said screw it. Im going to use one of my old silicone cases and ride this phone until I drop it again and the screen cracks and then be done with smart phones. I didnt have any more glass protectors and for whatever reason gave this one a shot. I swear it\u2019s night and day. It went from screen protectors that were a 0/10 to one that is 10/10. Ive had a few \u201cuh oh\u201d drops onto tile floor and not only did the screen not crack, the screen protector barely has a scratch in it.Please try this brand. I have no relation to it or got paid for this review, but the money and sanity it has saved so far...for such a cheap price, I have to pay it forward. I hope others can confirm this. I promise you ive tried almost every screen protector out there and they all did nada. If you can go through my history you can see the other ones ive bought and they all stunk.I still have the green line from before that I want to fix, but im superstitious that if i fix my screen, ill jinx my luck. But now having this for a couple months, I think im going to get my screen fixed and feel safe with these protectors.Hope this helps someone :)",
