It seemed to get unstuck and had to tap harder for anything to work. I finally got this non-glass TPU protector. It was so easy to install. I got it to install bubble-free. Everything works great just like it was on the original screen. As 20+ has the curve and I have a case, this screen protector works as expected.The package comes with 3 screens and a camera lens screen. It has all the install accessories and a link to the instruction video. There is a tiny gap at the curve edges but that helps with the external phone case. I am very happy with the install. Very durable.",

                "reviewText": "I prefer a non-glass (I. E. Soft plastic) screen protector vs a glass protector.Understanding that it might be less protection for cracks in your screen, it does still give you good protection from scratches, coins in the same pocket against screen, etc.I'm pleased that it came with multiple protectors. I'm known to not read directions carefully and that being said had I watched the video more closely, it may have shown me to use the provided straight edge to smooth out the air bubbles from the screen as I was laying the protector on to the screen.My first attempt did not go well and left many bubbles that would not come out.I un-installed and reinstalled a fresh cover and it came out much improved.There was still a small speck under the cover, but not enough to ever be noticed again.Recommended purchase. Good product for the right price.",
