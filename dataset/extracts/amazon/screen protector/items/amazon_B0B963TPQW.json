My other Mocha screen protector protected my iPhone screen on Sunday after I accidentally dropped my phone from a ladder. This one came fast too. Ordered Sunday, received today (Tuesday). I wanted the matte before, but it was unavailable last year when I purchased my phone. The process of installing this screen protector is super easy. I had it off-center a little bit and was able to reposition it and I did not end up with any bubbles under the glass. I like how there is a clear oval over the front camera to allow clear photos. Definitely recommend.",

I managed to align it perfectly but ended up with a few dust particles. A steamy bathroom after a hot shower is a great place to install all screen protectors because there\u2019s less dust in the air, but alas, I was in a rush and didn\u2019t do that.Bad news though, after about 3 weeks, I noticed a chip along the bottom edge. I cannot remember dropping the phone on anything hard - just once onto the carpeted footwell of my car. Cracks were growing. I easily removed it, just carefully lifted by an edge. I purchased another that I haven\u2019t installed yet. There was no damage to the iPhone screen.",
