This protector went on easily and there were no specks of dirt or air bubbles. I was amazed and delighted. Hopefully, it will hold up well and protect my screen! By the way, I am using a Supcase with a belt clip, and the screen protector fit nicely under the lip of the case (of course, you have to cut away the cheesy plastic screen protector that came with the Supcase, but you can easily do that with a razor knife.)",
