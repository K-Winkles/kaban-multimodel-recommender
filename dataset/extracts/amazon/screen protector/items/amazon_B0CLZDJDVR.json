When I tried using it under my Otter Box, it moved around and it was difficult to get the phone to react to a touch. Even though I might have been able to adjust the phone sensitivity, when I touched the screen, the glass kept moving, and you could actually hear it as I touched it. I see that other people shared my concerns and I wish I had taken the time to read the reviews before I ordered this useless item. I returned it.",
