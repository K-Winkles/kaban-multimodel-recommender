The installation was a breeze, and the tempered glass offers excellent protection for the screen. It's clear and barely noticeable when in use. The touch sensitivity is also great, and it doesn't interfere with my device's responsiveness. The fact that it comes in a pack of two is a nice bonus for future replacements. While it's not a perfect five stars due to the occasional fingerprint smudges, it's still a quality product that I'd recommend for iPad owners looking to protect their screens",

                "reviewText": "I just replaced this today, which is why I'm not rating the durability. I've replaced scores of screen protectors over the years and this is one of the easiest I've ever dealt with.Some might call this overkill, but you can't redo this without wasting the screen so...Step 1: clean the heck out of the screen first. Don't just use what they give you, use a Clorox wipe or something similar and get all the crud, hand grease etc off before you do anything else.Step 2: let it sit for 5 minutes and repeat. This time, wipe it dry with a clean cotton towel.Step 3: now clean it with the stuff they give you, except for the \"lint remover\", which is just a sticker. Throw that away, it won't pick up anything after what you've already done.Step 4: take the iPad out of its case (if it has one) and lie it down on a flat, stable surface with some space. Have it facing horizontally/sideways so that the camera is on the left or right.Step 5: take the protection sheet, find the orange sticker tab, and pull it from the mylar to expose the sticky side.Step 6: note where the camera is and line up the mylar with the closer corners for a perfect fit. Gently lower the sticky side away from you onto the iPad. Try to hold the far end up a bit while gently pushing down with the other hand to keep air bubbles to a minimum.Step 7: you will have some air-bubbles, no matter how many of these you've swapped. On this attempt I had four: a dime-sized, two nickel-sized and a half-dollar sized near the center of the screen.Some people swear by credit cards, some like squeegees, etc. I always use a folded-up piece of paper and \"herd\" all of the bubbles to the nearest edge until they're gone.This application took me just under 20 minutes, but there's no air bubbles and the screen is very receptive to the touch.",
