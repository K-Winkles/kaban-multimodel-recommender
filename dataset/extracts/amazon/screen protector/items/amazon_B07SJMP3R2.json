                "reviewText": "These tempered glass screen protectors are truly amazing. The package includes everything you need to install it perfectly, and although I'm notoriously uncoordinated I found it super easy. The steps are to wipe your phone with an alcohol wipe, clean it with a soft cloth, put this frame-like thing over the phone, peel the backing off the screen protector and apply to the phone. It went perfectly in like three minutes total. No bubbles, no mis-alignment. Best of all, the protector doesn't interfere with the responsiveness of the touch screen.I forgot mine was there after a while until I dropped my phone on pavement (ouch) and the protector had spider cracks right in the middle. But when I peeled the protector off, my actual phone screen was completely fine - not a scratch. So all I had to do is use the second protector included in the box. I just bought a second box as insurance just in case I break the second protector too. There's really no excuse for anyone with an S9 Plus not to use this.",

This product exceeded all my expectations in every way, and I couldn't be happier with the results.First and foremost, the installation was an absolute breeze. The package comes with everything you need to achieve a bubble-free, perfect fit on my phone screen. The clear instructions and included accessories made it an effortless process, even for someone like me who isn't particularly skilled in applying screen protectors.The quality of the tempered glass is top-notch. It's incredibly durable and has already protected my phone from a few accidental drops and scratches without sustaining any damage itself. The screen sensitivity remains unaffected, and it feels just as responsive as it did without the protector.The fingerprint-resistant coating is a game-changer. I no longer find myself constantly wiping smudges off my screen. It stays clean and clear, which enhances my viewing experience and keeps my phone looking pristine.The two-pack is an added bonus, ensuring I have a backup in case of any mishaps. The value for the price is unbeatable, especially considering the level of protection and quality offered by Supershieldz.I can confidently say that Supershieldz has gained a loyal customer in me. This screen protector is an absolute must-have for anyone with a Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus. It's durable, easy to install, and provides top-notch protection. I wholeheartedly give it a 5-star rating and would recommend it to all Galaxy S9 Plus users. Thank you, Supershieldz, for creating a product that truly delivers on its promises!",

                "reviewText": "Installation kit lets you pop these on really easily, and the fit seems fine. Clarity is excellent.That said, you sacrifice some touch sensitivity.Since I'm using these to help prevent a very minor crack in my screen from getting worse until I get around to replacing my phone, I'm okay with that trade-off, though it's a little annoying since I mainly use my phone for messaging, games, and other touch-based applications. That said, either I'm getting used to it, or it's getting a bit better as it settles in, so we'll see how it goes.YMMV based on how you use your phone. If you're more of a talk-on-the-phone kind of person, these screen protectors might be perfect for you.For me, they'll do for now, though when I replace my phone, I'll probably switch back to the plastic ones, which have served me fine thus far (this is the only screen crack I've ever had, and it happened when I was between screen protectors).",

                "reviewText": "I had the same experience as many other reviewers.The screen is super easy to install using the included guide.Since there is only adhesive around the edges there was a slight gap between the screen and shield. However, reduced screen sensitivity was minor, in my opinion.It lasted a couple of weeks until i dropped my phone. No damage to the phone but the protector popped right off and the adhesive will not re-stick to the phone. Bu its a 2 pack so I'll put the other one on and see how far I get.Its definitely not a great screen protector. However, at 11 bucks for a 2 pack its $5 attempt at protection. Not breaking the bank. Its performance equaled the cost.Update. As I stated earlier, you get what you pay for so I really can't be too surprised at the poor quality of this screen protector. They pop off if the phone is dropped or handled roughly. Once they are off, the adhesive no longer secures sufficiently to the phone.Do not buy.",
