The plastic flexibility is the exact reason why we call it tempered glass screen protector. Tempered glass is a type of safety glass that is stronger than ordinary glass. 2. It cannot be seen from the appearance that it is glass or plastic. As a customer, what can we do to identify it? There is an easy, quick, cost-effective way to test it yourself, and it's very accurate. Most plastics have a melting point between 160 and 210 degrees Celsius, and glass materials are at least over 1400 degrees Celsius, so is there a lighter around? 3. Does it come with a cleaning wipe to use prior to placing on the phone? Yes, the package includes: 6*Guide Stickers, 3*Wet Wipe&3*Dry Wipe,3*Dust Absorber. 4. How can I remove bubbles? Use the kit in the package to clean the screen before placing the screen protector. If there are bubbles,try to gently press the bubbles with your finger or with a ruler,but the screen surface needs a thin cloth pad to avoid scratching the protector. 5. How can I remove a cracked glass screen protector? Lift the screen protector with the card from any corner of the screen protector, then hold the corner and remove slowly. (If you find CHIP or CRACK on the screen protector, for your safety, please wear gloves when removing the screen protector.)",

                "reviewText": "I've been using the Ailun Glass Screen Protector for my iPhone 14 Plus/14 Pro Max, and it has consistently provided excellent protection for my phone's screen. This screen protector is a reliable safeguard against scratches, scrapes, and bumps, and I can confirm that it does not crack easily, even under stress.Touch-screen accuracy is crucial for a screen protector, and this product excels in this regard. It maintains the original response sensitivity of the iPhone, ensuring no issues with touch functionality.One of the standout features is its hydrophobic and oleophobic coating. It effectively repels sweat and oil, making it easy to clean fingerprints off the screen. This ensures that the screen remains clear and high-definition, preserving the vibrant display of the iPhone.Installation is often a pain point with screen protectors, but not with this one. The process is straightforward and bubble-free, aided by the included cleaning wipes and cloth. It's refreshing to apply a screen protector and enjoy a pristine screen immediately after installation.The thinness of the screen protector is notable. It feels unobtrusive and doesn't add any noticeable bulk to the phone, maintaining its sleek profile. Additionally, it's compatible with my phone case, which is a significant plus.I've had no issues with the screen protector interfering with any sensors or the functionality of the Dynamic Island, which is essential for the full functionality of the iPhone 14 Pro Max.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the quality and durability of this screen protector. It's a high-quality product that offers great protection without compromising the phone's functionality or display quality.I would definitely recommend the Ailun Glass Screen Protector to other iPhone 14 Plus/14 Pro Max users. It's a small investment for a significant increase in protection and peace of mind.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve gotten glass screen protectors from tjis brand before and have never had any complaints or issues. My iPad currently has an Ailun screen protector\u2014 super easy to install (first try!) + zero bubbles. I just got a 3-pack for my iPhone 13 and it\u2019s the same deal\u2014 first try, I got the protector on perfectly + without any bubbles. I do think prepping properly makes a difference. You need to actually use all the included prep supplies, and work on a clean, flat surface to minimize any external interference (aka dust!). It doesn\u2019t seem that big of a deal but a little patience goes a long way with this sort of thing. Honestly, I got a multi-pack expecting to mess up, but I definitely see a huge improvement in my installation when I actually take the time to fully follow the steps; wet wipe > dry wipe > dust sticker (excessively, even!). Just my own two cents.Anyway, this screen protector is great. Truly. I\u2019ve already dropped my phone a few times since installing it and both my screen protector + my actual phone screen are unscathed (knock on wood). As per many past experiences with this brand as well, I have faith that should my phone take a major fall, the screen protector will absorb the damage and my screen will be spared, as it always has been.I highly recommend this product + will definitely continue getting this brand!",
