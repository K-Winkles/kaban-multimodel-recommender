The plastic flexibility is the exact reason why we call it tempered glass screen protector. Tempered glass is a type of safety glass that is stronger than ordinary glass. 2. It cannot be seen from the appearance that it is glass or plastic. As a customer, what can we do to identify it? There is an easy, quick, cost-effective way to test it yourself, and it's very accurate. Most plastics have a melting point between 160 and 210 degrees Celsius, and glass materials are at least over 1400 degrees Celsius, so is there a lighter around? 3. Does it come with a cleaning wipe to use prior to placing on the phone? Yes,the package includes: 4*Guide Stickers, 2*Wet Wipe & 2*Dry Wipe, 2*Dust Absorber 4.How can I remove bubbles? Use the kit in the package to clean the screen before placing the screen protector.If there are bubbles, try to gently press the bubbles with your finger or with a ruler,but the screen surface needs a thin cloth pad to avoid scratching the protector. 5.How can I remove a cracked glass screen protector? Lift the screen protector with the card from any corner of the screen protector, then hold the corner and remove slowly. (If you find CHIP or CRACK on the screen protector, for your safety, please wear gloves when removing the screen protector.)",

As someone with clumsy hands who drops their phone often, one of these probably lasted me around five months, which is on average with all of the others I've tried. Still good though.",

                "reviewText": "Tempered glass is THE way to go for your iPhone (or any phone) protection. I recently had my phone on top of the car while working on a project in the garage. My husband decided to go to the store and took the car. When he returned I found my phone wedged in the hydraulic door of the hatchback trunk. The whole phone was in there, slammed in.The tempered glass protector worked just as it is supposed to, the protector shattered but the phone was fine! That\u2019s at least until a few days later I noticed one of the camera lens was smashed!! I hadn\u2019t been using a camera cover before. So I purchased this version with the camera lens protector too.I chipped off the remaining glass lens and used this to cover it and put in a new screen protector too.My husband actually thought I went to the store and got a new phone because the camera lens looks like it never was broken with this on it!",
