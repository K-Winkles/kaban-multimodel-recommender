                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using this brand for years but gained a new appreciation for it today. I dropped my phone into my La-Z-Boy and didn\u2019t realize it until I heard a horrible grinding sound upon swiveling. I\u2019m not sure exactly what happened, but the metal internal mechanism of the recliner cleaner tested my Trianium screen protector. The protector took 99% of the punishment; there is just a minor cosmetic scratch on the screen itself. Given this could have been pretty catastrophic (the Apple leather case I had on is a complete goner), I am impressed and grateful. Just ordered another 3-pack to have on hand after installing the last one that came in this kit!Prior to this, I\u2019ve only damaged a Trianium protector once through many minor drops. Zero damage to the phone itself.The screen protector is easy to install, and I\u2019ve never run into major bubbles.Highly recommend this brand!",
