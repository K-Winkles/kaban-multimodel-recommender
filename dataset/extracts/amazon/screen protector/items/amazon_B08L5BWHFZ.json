The cost to replace the screen is over $200. The phone still works great, I had already ordered a new phone, and I just planned to give my old phone to my kiddo. To protect his fingers, we figured we would try ordering this screen protector.This screen protector works perfectly! Surprisingly, there aren't many bubbles, despite the cracked screen.The protector was easy to apply. It was a little confusing to find the right set of video instructions, but we managed. It comes with an alcohol wipe and sticky things to help clean and dust your screen.",

                "reviewText": "Got this SuperShieldz glass protector for a Pixel 5, and it works pretty well once attached. The main complaint I had was that it that the included alignment system for installing it didn't work that well. The system has you using two stickers to fix the protector to hold it on the phone where you want it, then peel the backing on the protector to expose the glue before applying it. The problem is that the two alignment stickers are very weak, but the backing on the protector is very strong, which caused me to have to peel very hard on the backing, which loosened the stickers meant to keep the protector aligned. So basically I had to start over and do the alignment manually.This wouldn't be too bad, except that I had just applied an ArmorSuit Dry screen protector to a Pixel 7 phone, and their system is way better. It came with a little plastic tab that sticks in the charging port of the phone, and has little hooks that the screen protector hooks into to keep it aligned with the phone. It was fool proof and made the process so easy to install that having to manually align a screen protector feels much worse now.",

                "reviewText": "My phone fell from the roof of my car at 40mph and counting. Naturally, it fell screen down. I made a U-turn and cringed as I watched it get runover by a minivan. It flew two feet up, twisting in the air; evoking thoughts of a Simone Biles floor routine. I retrieved the phone and observed the tempered glass protective screen to be damaged. I put it in my purse, gently, fearing the worst. When I got home I crossed my fingers and peeled away the screen. Not a single scratch to the actual phone screen. Not one. In fact, I'm typing this review from my smooth, damage free phone screen. I'll be applying the second shield that comes in the pack shortly and then buying a back up. Oh, and then going to write a review on the phone case as well.",

I've used them on my last 2 phones with no issues.Just be aware you only have one or 2 chances to get it right because if you remove it more than twice to reposition it you will end up with too much dust and finger prints on the sticky side and have to throw it.Little tip. I never use the included cleaning tool or cloths. The most effective way Is get a baby wipe or a disposable wipe of any kind. Give the screen a good scrub and then dry it straight away with a clean paper towel to remove the moisture and streaks. That's it. One paper disposable wipe and one dry paper towel. The alcohol wipes arent needed. Alcohol is not really an effective cleaner for phone screens unless your trying to remove glue of some type.Great product.",
