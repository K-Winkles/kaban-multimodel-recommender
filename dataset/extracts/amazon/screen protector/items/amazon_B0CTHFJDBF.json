This one is a real nice kit that includes all the things you need for a perfect application. It has the wet and dry wipe to clean the screen. More importantly, it has the plastic screen guide which ensures you are able to put on the glass in exactly the right location. This is an essential component to a good kit. My glass looks beautiful on my iPhone 14, and I would highly recommend this one.I also decided to use the camera lens protector for the back. It gets the job done well. The one thing I don't like about the camera protection is that the piece is made of plastic. This means that it won't be long before it gets scratched up, and that will begin to interfere with the quality of my photos. Because this camera protector wasn't really the reason I picked up this kit, it doesn't impact my satisfaction. But, do keep this in mind if you care about this part of the kit.",

                "reviewText": "This is another good screen protector for the Pixel 7a. It includes an alignment tool that you can snap onto the phone to make installation easy. Be sure to clean your screen thoroughly first and install it in a clean location to prevent dust from getting stuck to it and causing bubbles.",

                "reviewText": "Installation was straightforward and didn't seem to take a lot of time/effort.Sadly when it was done there were tiny bubbles under the screen protector, despite being scrupulous about cleaning the screen and avoiding dust. \"Interestingly\" they seemed to be mostly along the edges. Playing around a bit I did find I could use a fingernail to press them out, but it felt like playing space invaders for an hour or so. I still have a couple of tiny bubbles at the edge that seem to be resisting being pressed out but I don't even notice them unless I go to look for them.I did have to re-do my fingerprint scans, something I might not have known about had I not read another review. There were no directions in the package and I'm not willing to go to a Facebook page to see if there are directions there.",

Both the screen protector and camera lens protector are easy to install. Overall, I am very satisfied and would recommend to others.",
