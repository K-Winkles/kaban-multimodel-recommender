I found that they only lasted me about 2-4 months. It also gets occasional bubbles, which you can not remove. However, what you pay vs what you get is great. For what they provide with the price I\u2019d say it\u2019s amazing and worth it. Furthermore, the cleaning supplies were amazing. The instructions on how to put on the protector was clear and straightforward as well.Overall, great product but the screen protectors are not that strong.",

I\u2019ve used these for my own iPhone 12 mini and I\u2019ve also helped people put them on 13 minis, 12s, and SEs and they\u2019ve been flawless every time. They feel perfect and you can barely tell they\u2019re even there. Great price and they come with everything you need. Will be buying more in the future.",

My first one cracked after about 6 months of use. Not sure how, but the corner got cracked and it spread all over. So, I have no complains with having 3 sets per box for an affordable price. Even beginners can successfully put a screen protector with their kit and instructions. No problem with screen responding with this protector on. Will definitely recommend to others and repurchase.",
