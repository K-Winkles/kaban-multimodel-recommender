                "reviewText": "I have about 10 years of experience with screen protectors. First, I will always advocate for a tempered glass screen protector over film. Tempered glass offers really protection against drops and scratches. For example, I once was working out several years ago and dropped 100 lb dumbbell on another phone that had tempered glass screen protection. The screen protector cracked and shattered, but the phone itself remained in perfect condition. That incident confirmed my understanding that tempered glass screen protectors are always the way to go. By contrast, a film screen protector only really \"protects\" your phone against scratches. But if you were to drop your phone, or drop an item onto your phone, your phone might experience real damage.Onto the specifics of this screen protector. There's only a few vital components to keep in mind:- Does it protect the phone? yes- Does it fit the dimensions of the phone / fully cover the screen? yes- Is it comfortable to swipe on? yes- Is it easy to install? most definitely yesThe main difficulty in screen protectors is the installation process. Many screen protectors don't come with the stencil cover which enables an easy installation. So usually you are tasked with having to be extra careful with installing the screen protector, which inevitably means bubbles underneath the protector. You have to spend a lot of time getting rid of the bubbles. Not here with the Spigen screen protector.You clean the phone with materials given, you apply the stencil covering over the phone, you press down on the sticker, you wait 30 seconds, then you take off the stencil covering. And you're pretty much done. You have a perfect fit and perfect covering over your iphone pro 13 max. No bubbles.Spigen is a proven Korean brand. They are immersed in the world of technology, technology manufacturing, and product quality. I would recommend this product 10 times over. Can't imagine a better alternative.",

                "reviewText": "This protector is the best quality protector I have ever owned for any phone at any price point. It's worth paying more than a few bucks, but also not worth getting ripped off buying a piece of tempered glass for $50. This product falls right in between that giving the absolute best for your buck. A great quality piece of glass with the easiest, most intuitive installation. The alignment is perfect every time and leaves no room for guess work. It is also tough and lasts. It's saved my screen multiple times and if it has cracked after a hard fall, I happily replace it with another. Another plus is that is comes with two. I will buy this protector for all my future phones as well.",
