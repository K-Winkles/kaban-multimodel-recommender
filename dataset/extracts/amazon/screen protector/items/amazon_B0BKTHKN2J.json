                "reviewText": "These screen protectors are quite nice for the price, with beveled edges and easy installation. The centering frame that is provided make it simple to place the screen in the correct location. The biggest challenge with these (and other) screens is confirming the screen surface is dust free. Wet wipes and drying cloth are provided. Using a bright flashlight at a glancing angle low to the phone makes the particles easy to see and remove. The biggest downside for this manufacturer is that the drying cloth deposits more dust particles than it removes. If you get these, toss the cloth and use a quality microfiber cloth instead, and that will minimize the number of particles that need to be removed with the adhesive dust remover provided.",

                "reviewText": "I admit I was a little nervous about removing and replacing my old cracked screen protector but the CANSHN kit made it easy. I watched the helpful installation video a couple times and followed the steps they suggested. The cleaning and drying wipes made it easy to make my XR screen immaculately clean and the installation frame made it easy to perfectly align the new screen protector during the installation. I had a couple of very small air bubbles that were easy to remove by pressing down on the newly installed screen protector and swiping my finger toward the edge of the phone. I'm extremely happy with the new screen protector and it works great with my iPhone. The package includes 3 screen protectors and additional cleaning wipes so I'll be able to easily install that others in the future if necessary.",

                "reviewText": "These are fantastic screen protectors. I've already had a few scares where I thought I managed to damage it, but it's holding up amazingly well.The box includes a lot of super helpful little tools to help you apply these perfectly. I greatly appreciated both the wet and dry wipes to make my phone screen spotless before installing, but my favorite thing was a frame you can snap onto your phone that makes it incredibly simple to align the protector on your phone screen. No more trying to eyeball how to center the protector and having to constantly redo it--this went on perfectly in one try! There were a few bubbles, but they were very easy to smooth out.This company has wonderful customer service too. There was initially an issue with my order, but when I messaged them about it, they were very quick to respond and resolve it. I'm very happy to have chosen their screen protectors over any others!",
