They can also be very highly reflective out in bright sun, making it a little difficult to see your screen clearly at times.

                "reviewText": "I loved the ease of installation with this screen saver. The guide frame they give makes sure you don't put it on all wonky and end up having to reinstall and the screen prep is minimal. If you want to get super technical, the purple color shown in the ad is a little exaggerated--it's more of a soft purple mirror effect, but it's still a really good privacy screen.",

I have the iPhone 15 pro max and got out of my full size truck, laid my phone on the tire and forgot to grab it before I drove off. I found the phone screen down in my gravel driveway and the screen protector was DESTROYED, But when I peeled it off, my actual screen was PERFECTLY intact!!",
