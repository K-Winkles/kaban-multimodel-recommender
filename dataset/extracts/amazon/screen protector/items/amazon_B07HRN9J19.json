It's a fantastic addition to my phone, offering unbeatable protection without compromising on clarity.The installation was a breeze, thanks to the precise design and clear instructions provided. The screen protector adhered seamlessly to my phone's display, leaving no bubbles or imperfections.What truly impressed me is how this screen protector manages to provide robust defense against scratches, smudges, and even accidental drops while maintaining the stunning clarity and touch sensitivity of the iPhone's original screen. It's almost as if it's invisible!I appreciate that it doesn't interfere with Face ID or the phone's responsiveness in any way. Plus, the oleophobic coating keeps fingerprints and smudges at bay, ensuring that my screen looks pristine at all times.This screen protector has already saved my phone from a couple of potential disasters, and it's as good as new. It's a small investment that pays off in protecting your valuable device.In summary, if you own an iPhone 11 Pro Max, this screen protector is a must-have accessory. It provides crystal-clear protection that you won't even notice is there, all while preserving the phone's functionality and aesthetics. I can't recommend it enough!",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Mkeke Compatible with iPhone 11 Screen Protector for my iPhone XR and I am extremely satisfied with this product. As someone who is prone to dropping their phone, I was in need of a reliable and effective screen protector. The Mkeke tempered glass film definitely delivers on both of those fronts.The installation process was a breeze - the included tools made it simple to align the protector perfectly on my phone's screen. The tempered glass is incredibly strong and durable, providing excellent protection against scratches, cracks, and other types of damage. I've dropped my phone several times since installing the protector and it has held up extremely well, with no visible damage to the screen.The clarity of the tempered glass is also impressive - it doesn't interfere with the display quality of my phone's screen in any way. The 3-pack of protectors is also a great value, ensuring that I have a backup if needed. The clear design is perfect for those who prefer a subtle, minimalist look for their phone's screen.I would highly recommend the Mkeke Compatible with iPhone 11 Screen Protector to anyone in need of a reliable and effective screen protection solution. Whether you're prone to dropping your phone or simply want to ensure that your screen stays in pristine condition, this tempered glass film is an excellent choice. With its ease of installation, excellent protection, and affordability, the Mkeke screen protector is a no-brainer for anyone in need of a quality screen protector for their iPhone 11 or XR.",

                "reviewText": "I read that people rated this product badly because of the screen protector not fitting the screen and I was tentative about getting this brand, but I needed a protector so I gave it a shot.The case it comes in is convenient, like a hollow book, so you can store the extra alcohol wipes, dust stickers, screen protectors and glass cloth for later use easily. The instructions were easy to follow but my one disliking is nothing was labeled, I had to guess to figure out which had the alcohol wipe (it's the paperish packet btw). There was also some sort of plastic applicator guide thingy? But they dont reference it in the instructions, nor did I know how to use it. Bummer.After I cleaned it, I slipped the back sticker off the protector, making sure not to touch the inner side of it, and eyeballed where it should adhere to.The screen protector IS ONLY MEANT TO GO OVER THE PART OF THE SCREEN THAT LIGHTS UP. It can't go any more because the phone is rounded and I'm pretty sure that's why people rated this so low because they didn't know any better.I think I got it pretty spot on with only like 1/12 of an inch error but it's not noticeable at all. The screen protector will always look a little off because you can't cover an entire iPhone 11 screen with one but slap on a phone case and your eyes adjust easily.There was one tiny little bubble that formed that I can't get out of the dang underside which irritates me.Disclaimer: In the photos, there are little hair-line scratches but those are underneath the screen protector, my phone screen is covered in them (walmart refurbished standards *sigh*). But the screen protector fills out and hides 99% of them!! Added bonus! Just not all, but it's not a product defect it's my phone lol. ALSO, that weird screen discoloration was caused by taking a picture of a phone with another phone, no it does not look like that in real life, just photography error.I have read reviews about the screen protector being easily broken but for the low price I paid and the screen underneath being safe, it's worth the money. Plus you get 3 screen protectors, so if you chuck your phone into oblivion or you just fail that hard at applying it to your screen, you get 2 more chances.TLDR; Great product!! Would totally reccomend. \ud83d\udc4c",

Has everything you need to remove lint and dust, easy to apply/install. When it was time to replace, removal was extremely easy and left no residue. Fits well on the screen, no issues with the touchscreen, sensitivity, etc. Has protected my phone through many drops and falls with only one major scratch on the protector itself, NOT the phone's screen.",
