                "reviewText": "The first thing about this screen protector is that it does not have any tools to align so you have to be careful when installing this because it is hard to remove without making the protector useless. It does not reduce the screen sensitivity too much but be aware with temper glass you may lose the ability to use your thumb print reader. It is not the protectors fault, it is just a sacrifice with having a temper glass with the s23 ultra. There is not really any screen protector that is temper glass that I found works so just be awre of that before you get a temper glass protector. You do get three so you get either a few chances to get it right or just extra screen protector when one becomes cracked or damaged in the future. The screen protector is packed well in a hard casing to prevent it from coming cracked or broken. In terms of installation, it can be difficult in term of alignment. Be aware of the case you have as well as S23 edges are pretty tight so you may actually pop this screen protector up if you are not careful. One thing I would recommend is figuring out how to align it first before trying to apply anything. It come with the usual which is alcohol wipe, microfiber wipe, and those stickers to remove lint from the screen. There is no alignment applicator. It is pretty much bubble free and I do not see any noticeable lint or debris under the screen protector but it is all dependent on how cautious you are during installation. I did find some lint trapped when applying it the first time. It was just trapped but did not create any kind of bubbles but I did have to apply it again. Like I said before, it comes with multiple protectors. If possible, try to installed the screen protector near a fan free environment to ensure no dust particles land on the screen. I found that having a fan close to it makes lint and dust get trapped under the protector. When using the items that come with it, it is pretty much just wipe, dry, and apply. After using it for awhile, it is pretty scratch resistant and if it does happen to crack I always have the other one to replace it if needed. There is also a camera temper glass screen protector and it matches my samsung phone well so you barely see it. Honestly I did not really find a need for it but I did try to install it. I went through the same process to put this on but make sure you have it clean and lint free as possible or you may get that lint on your camera and have to remove it. Other than that, that camera and screen protector had not issues with hindering the camera quality. Overall this is a decent protector that can be challenging to install. I do think it does hinder my finger print unlock option but there is barely any temper glass screen protector I found that really works with the finger print reader. The camera temper glass is a nice option as well.",

It's also more effective in that these thin protectors allow me to actually use my fingerprint again, instead of all the cases that I can't seem to get to recognize me.They were easy to apply, didn't have any issues with bubbles, and was easy to take off and reapply when I decided to replace the one I really did a number on (but hey, it protected the screen completely so that's a win!).",

The 3 pack is great value and the inclusion of the camera lens protector is a thoughtful touch. The screen protector was easy to apply, fits perfectly with my case, and the touch response is as smooth as without it. I\u2019m impressed by its durability - it\u2019s already saved my screen from a few scratches. The customer service was also excellent, they assured me of a replacement or refund if there were any issues. Highly recommended!",
