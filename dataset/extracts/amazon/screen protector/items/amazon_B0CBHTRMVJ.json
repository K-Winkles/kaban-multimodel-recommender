                "reviewText": "The package comes with not only four screen protectors but also four tempered glass camera lens protectors, which is a fantastic value for the price.One of the things I appreciate most about these screen protectors is how easy they are to install. The included installation kit made the process smooth, and I was able to apply them without any bubbles or dust. Additionally, they are case-friendly, meaning they fit great with my phone case, which is a huge plus.In terms of durability, these are excellent. The tempered glass construction provides excellent protection against scratches, cracks, and other damage, ensuring that my iPhone 15 Pro's screen stays looking pristine for as long as possible. I also love how the protectors are ultra-thin, so they don't add any bulk to my phone or interfere with the touch sensitivity of the screen.Another excellent feature is their clarity. The high-definition transparency allows for a crystal-clear viewing with no loss of screen brightness or color accuracy. Whether I'm watching videos, browsing the web, or playing games.Overall, I couldn't be happier the combination of durability, ease of installation, and crystal-clear clarity make these a must-have accessory for iPhone 15 Pro's screen in pristine condition.",

It was easy to apply and I appreciate that it came with a little cleaning kit to use before applying. I didn\u2019t even think about camera protects but I\u2019m glad it came with them since on this model the cameras stick out so far from the phone and can easily get scratched. At first I thought it was wasteful that it comes in a 4 pack when I only need 1 but now I\u2019m glad to have them in case I drop my phone and crack the screen protector, I can just replace it.",

                "reviewText": "The Ferilinso 4 Pack Screen Protector for the iPhone 15 is a bit like getting a combo meal that's only half satisfying. The main course, the front screen protector, is pretty much spot-on. It's like a trusty shield, keeping my screen safe from daily battles with keys and coins in my pocket.But then there's the side dish that lets the meal down \u2013 the camera cover. I loved the concept; it's like giving your phone's camera a little bulletproof vest. However, the reality is more like a flimsy raincoat. It cracks under pressure, almost too easily. After a short while, my camera's protector looked like a spiderweb, which isn't exactly the sleek, protected look I was going for.So, here's the deal: If you're in it for the front screen protector, you're in good hands. It fits well, does its job, and is like having an invisible guard for your phone's precious face. But the camera protector? It's a great idea in theory, but in practice, it's as fragile as a house of cards in a windstorm.Bottom line, it's a decent purchase if you're not too bothered about the camera cover, or if you're willing to treat it with kid gloves. Otherwise, you might find yourself in the market for a more robust solution to keep your phone's camera safe.",

The camera protectors are great, installation is easy and there are absolutely no imperfections when I take pictures. For what you get, this is a very good value item.So I messed up on installation a couple of times and got a few air bubbles. I got in touch with customer service and they offered me a replacement kit after two days. Five stars for that. Painless process, highly recommended for this reason.",

The Bad: I know the price is great, but as the old saying goes \u201cyou get what you paid for\u201d These protectors were thin and two of them had tiny air bubbles in the glass that didn\u2019t become apparent until the protector was on the phone. The one on this phone I am typing with chipped on the second day it was applied and today there is a hairline crack, even though no pressure was applied to protector. Maybe because of the hype about the new glass on the iPhone 15 the protectors didn\u2019t need to be thick??? I would look elsewhere and pay a little more.Update: I had an opportunity to retry this item recently and unlike my last order, the glass was of better quality. Looks like I got a bad batch and the QC improved. The company also reached out to me and refunded my money so kudos to their customer service.",
