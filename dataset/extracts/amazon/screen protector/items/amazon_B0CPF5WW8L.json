                "reviewText": "I recently fitted my iPhone 11 with the AVOAR Privacy Screen Protector, and the process was straightforward, thanks to the included alignment frame. Although we encountered a bubble under the screen, it was easily remedied with a little pressure.The instructions provided were mostly clear, yet they left us puzzled about the purpose of the \u201cscreen guide\u201d stickers. A bit more clarity or a detailed explanation would have been appreciated.Our primary reason for purchasing was to protect the screen, and on that front, it performs well. The privacy feature, which was a secondary consideration, works variably depending on the viewing angle. It\u2019s not entirely reliable for ensuring privacy from all angles, but it does offer a level of screen obscuration that might deter casual onlookers.In summary, this screen protector is easy to install and doesn\u2019t interfere with the phone\u2019s functionality. While the privacy feature has its limitations, it\u2019s an added bonus on top of the main benefit of screen protection. I\u2019d recommend this product for those looking for straightforward screen protection with a mild privacy feature as a secondary benefit.",

                "reviewText": "I used this for an iPhone 14 plus. And the packaging was great. It comes in a box with 2 separate compartments for the 2 screens with their respective cleaning materials. A problem you face a lot with these screen protectors is the fact that the \"wet\" wipes are often anything but. Not with this one! My wet wipes were wet and good to clean. The cleaning materials were extensive and honestly you can ditch the packaging because most of everything is already labelled for you with the kit on the materials.The auto-alignment kit is great. Everything is numbered and it's easy to follow. The adhesion, dust removal, and alignment were all perfect. I did have some bubbles, but all it took was for me to lift the edges and put them back down and it was pristine. Only one piece of advice I would have is to hold down the auto-alignment kit with some force, as you'll feel it wanna pull off when you're doing the first step in taking the dust out. Other than that, this kit is the most user-friendly, affordable and the best one I've found so far! I would definitely recommend.",

I'd probably go with a different brand next time. The protector itself seems pretty nice, the hassle just wasn't worth it.",

                "reviewText": "This is a pair of screen protectors, but you won\u2019t need both right away. I say this because you won\u2019t mess up the first one and require a spare. This screen protector is the easiest cover I have ever installed. With five phones on our plan, I have installed A LOT of covers.You need to clean your glass with the included kit. Once the glass is clean, you simply place the plastic frame over your phone. Then, you pull the inside protection sheet off through the bottom of the frame. The cover begins to seal to your glass. Next, you press the back of the plastic frame, and then pull the frame off. Finally, you remove the plastic sheet off the top of the cover.I have ZERO bubbles. Not one tiny speck. My glass is PERFECT, and the entire process took two minutes. No trying to steady hands while carefully placing a sheet in the right spots. No pulling up and reapplying to remove stubborn bubbles. No holding your breath while attempting to get the cover on just right. This cover is EASY.If possible, I would give this screen protector more than five stars!!",

                "reviewText": "I kept seeing these phone screen protectors & thought \"how cool?!\" ! It fits right on top of your phone, so no more uneven screen protectors! That's the exact problem that I had with my last one! If you follow the directions step by step as I did, you seriously can't even tell there is a screen protector on my phone! With this being a privacy screen protector, I can see everything on my screen very clearly. If someone were sitting next to me, that person would only see a black screen if my brightness was 50% or lower. If my brightness was all the way up, that person next to me would only see that the screen is on, but can't make out what's on it. So I'd say the privacy part of it is fantastic! There's absolutely no bubbles on my screen, no air pockets, & it's lined up so perfectly you cant tell it's there! I would 100000% recommend this to anyone! 20/10, amazing product!",
