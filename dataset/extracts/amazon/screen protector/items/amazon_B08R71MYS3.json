A:This screen protector is a real tempered glass. The plastic flexibility is the exact reason why we call it tempered glass screen protector. Tempered or toughened glass is a type of safety glass processing treatment by controlled thermal or chemical to increase its strength and flexibility. 2.It can't tell it's Glass or Plastic by the appearance and we don't have the high-tech laboratory equipment at home, so what could we as a customer do to identify it? A: Well, there does have one simple, quick and cost-effective way to run a test all by yourself, and it's supper accurate.Based on the scientific fact that the Melting Point of most plastic at between 160 and 210 degrees Celsius while the glass material is at least over 1400 degrees Celsius, so is there a lighter around? 3.Does it come with a cleaning wipe to use prior to placing on the phone? A:Yes, the package includes: 9*Guide Stickers, 3*Wet Wipe&3*Dry Wipe,3*Dust Absorber, 1*cleaning cloth. 4.How can I remove bubbles? A:Before placing the screen protector, please first clean the screen by using kits in the package. If there are bubbles, please try to press the bubble by using your finger with a little force, and try to use a ruler or a credit card to help you with the problem, but a thin cloth pad is needed on the surface of the screen to avoid scratches on protector. 5.How can I remove a cracked glass screen protector? A:Lift the screen protector with the card from corners of the screen protector.
