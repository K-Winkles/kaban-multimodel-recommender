There is a QR code on the box where the phone film is packed, you can watch the installation video by scanning the QR code. The flexibility of the glass screen protector is the same as the plastic material, is it tempered glass or plastic? This screen protector is a real tempered glass. The plastic flexibility is the exact reason why we call it tempered glass screen protector. Tempered glass is a type of safety glass that is stronger than ordinary glass. How can I remove bubbles? Use the kit in the package to clean the screen before placing the screen protector.If there are bubbles, try to gently press the bubbles with your finger or with a ruler,but the screen surface needs a thin cloth pad to avoid scratching the protector. How can I remove a cracked glass screen protector? Lift the screen protector with the card from any corner of the screen protector, then hold the corner and remove slowly. (If you find CHIP or CRACK on the screen protector, for your safety, please wear gloves when removing the screen protector.) Does this work with the fingerprint reader? Yes it works. After installing the screen protector slightly moisten your finger tip before adding the finger print security option to your phone. There is a video to guide you in the product description.",

                "reviewText": "I've had this screen protector on my phone for 8 months. It was very easy to install, and the fit was perfect for my Samsung Galaxy S23.Tonight, this protector really earned its namesake, along with my undying gratitude. My pants pocket betrayed me, and my phone fell HARD (screen side down, of course) onto unrelenting concrete. 'Tis the season to be merry, but instead of sugerplums dancing in my head, I envisioned a trip to Verizon to get my screen fixed. However, what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a CRACK-FREE screen when I lifted the protector off my phone. The cover itself took the brunt of the hit and cracked as shown in the image, but my phone screen was completely pristine.The icing on the sugar cookie is that this protector comes in a pack of 2. I just installed its twin (RIP Protector 1 - lost, but not forgotten). I'm looking forward to a new year where my first resolution is to get rid of these traitorous pants!",

Not only does the company have QR codes to easily find your installation video, there is also a small instructions paper on how to adjust your fingerprint reader. I absolutely love the frame that came with the protector it has made installing the protector so easy and I didn't have any bubbles. This also comes with a tool to remove them if you get them. This will be the brand I go to from now on they covered everything needed and packaging is amazing too!Edit: I dropped my phone in the driveway. The picture above was the aftermath of the screen protector. This screen protector worked perfectly, there's not a single crack or chip in my phone screen! 10/10 I will be buying again.",

My biggest complaint, however, is that I was looking for a screen protector that did not have a cut out for the front facing camera. I wanted one that was full coverage. The pictures made it appear as though there was no cut out, but there is in fact a front facing camera cut out. If a full coverage screen protector is important to you, this is not the product for you. However, if that doesn't matter, then this is a great choice!",

                "reviewText": "Update: Nope! I Installed a second protector after the first shattered. It lasted about a week before it too shattered. These things are just too darn brittle and shatter far too easily. The lens cover I applied at the time time also popped off a couple days later. Do not recommend!*****I've purchased several different screen protectors over the years. When I got my new Samsung Galaxy S23 earlier this year, I picked this particular protector mostly for the fact that it came with an easy-install frame. The installation was simple and the protector looked great. Within a couple months I dropped the phone on some tile and it shattered. I actually thought it was the screen that shattered and assumed the protector was the only thing holding it together, so I didn't attempt to remove the protector until I knew I could find time to get the screen replaced. However, soon after, bits of the protector started to chip off and I realized, thankfully, it was just the protector that had shattered. I've never shattered a screen or a protector before. The protector was a little bit difficult to remove, but I peeled it off and put on #2 in the pack. Unfortunately, although I was super careful, these things are so staticky, I got a tiny spec of lint under the protector right in the center and it looks awful. Other than that, installation was again nearly fool proof. I'm not sure I'd purchase this brand again as its much more brittle than others I've used, but if you find installation daunting, you may like this one **while it lasts.** My previous brand of protector offered lifetime replacement (which I did need to use once), so I think I may switch back to that one now that I have a different model phone.",
