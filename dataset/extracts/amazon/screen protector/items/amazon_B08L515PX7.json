I replaced the first one after it got beat up a bit with the second one about a month ago and then dropped the phone HARD on a cement floor recently. It fell as if i threw it down and it bounced horribly off the cement in the worst possible way glass down. You can see from the pic all the breaks from this one horrible drop, especially top right. As i picked up the phone i thought it was over, but was stunned to see it survived w out a scratch when i took the cover off. I bought another 2pack of these that second! So now it's a solid 5+ for me!! Best $10 i ever spent!",

                "reviewText": "I'm tired of getting bubbles in my non-glass screen protectors but I hate glass screen protectors because of the fingerprints, but I thought I'd try this one because it claims to have an Oleophobic coating that resists fingerprints and easy install. WELL IT DOESN'T DO CRAP, IT SHOWS EVERY DAMN LITTLE FINGERPRINT. Also, you better watch the video because the stupid paper instructions don't tell you how to use the installation tray whatsoever and now my screen protector is too low on the screen and the idiotic black bars on the top and bottom don't align and it looks disgusting and covers all the sensors at the top. Pure waste of money. I guess it can keep the 1 star since it stuck well and didn't have any bubbles.Edit: After using this screen protector for a couple weeks now since I didn't have a backup and haven't had time to buy a new one, I've noticed a couple other super crappy things and with I could take my 1 star away.First of all, the screen protector had a bunch of tiny dots in it that are always visible in the sunlight and/or on a dark screen.Even worse, there's ALSO black bars on the SIDES of the screen protector that cover up part of your screen. I thought maybe I bought the wrong one, but this says it's for the Note 8 which I have???? The black bars don't fit AT ALL. I even reinstalled my screen protector correctly this time with the second one in the pack, and the bars cover up the curved edges of my screen on both sides. It's so bad I can even see part of my screen on the OUTSIDE of the black bars. This is the most idiotic thing I have ever seen on a screen protector in my life, why the hell are there even black bars on this thing???Last of all, more of little nitpick. I sanitize and wipe my phone down every day with rubbing alcohol on a cottonball for Covid and the screen protector is not water-tight. It has no adhesive on the clear part of the glass so there can't be air bubbles, but the liquid gets underneathe and leaves a water bubble instead. This is something that won't affect most people though probably, unless they also sanitize their phone everyday or drop it in water accidentally.",

One thing as other reviewers mentioned buttons near the curve of the screen have to be pushed with much more effort but you get used to it.The biggest issue I have is that I had this screen protector on for less than a week and the upper right and bottom left corner are already cracked/broken which is really disappointing (phone was not dropped or anything like that). At least there is a 2nd one that comes with the pack but if they only last a week then not sure I will purchase again.",

But the screen protector cracks Not my actual phone screen. I drop my phone so often I usually leave the cracked screen protector on until I can't stand it anymore then use the 2nd one in the pack.",
