I was expecting it to make the watch look substantially bulkier, which I was a little worried about since my wrist is so small, but it doesn\u2019t! Very sleek and easy to put on.There is some slight decrease in the sensitivity of my screen now, mainly around the edges of the screen, and most noticeable when using the keyboard to reply to messages. Usually just requires an extra tap or three. Not enough of a hassle that it makes me rethink using it.I have yet to really put this screen protector to the test (I.e., go rock climbing with my watch on) but I will try to remember to update my review when I do.",

                "reviewText": "Hi y'all, it's Rashoxmon back again with another Amazon product review. Today's review is on the Smiling Case Built-in Tempered Glass Screen Protector for the Apple Watch SE/Series.I recently purchased the Smiling Case with the built-in tempered glass screen protector for my Apple Watch SE, and I have been extremely impressed with its performance.Touch Sensitivity:One of my biggest concerns with screen protectors is the impact on touch sensitivity. I'm delighted to report that this protector doesn't diminish the responsiveness of my Apple Watch's touchscreen at all. It feels just as smooth and accurate as if there were no protector installed.Durability:I'm an active person, and my Apple Watch often encounters rough surfaces like concrete, wood, and metal corners. Despite these occasional bumps and scrapes, the Smiling Case's tempered glass protector has held up incredibly well. There are no scratches or cracks on my Apple Watch's screen, which is a testament to the quality of this product.Ease of Installation:Installing the protector was a breeze. It fits perfectly, and there were no annoying air bubbles to deal with during the application. It's clear that the manufacturer put a lot of thought into the design to ensure a seamless installation process.Overall Impression:In summary, the Smiling Case Built-in Tempered Glass Screen Protector is a fantastic accessory for anyone looking to protect their Apple Watch's screen without sacrificing touch sensitivity or aesthetics. It provides reliable, durable protection against daily wear and tear. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.If you own an Apple Watch SE or Series and want to keep its screen in pristine condition, I highly recommend giving the Smiling Case a try. It's a small investment that pays off in long-term screen protection.",

                "reviewText": "I first bought these on a recommendation from a coworker. I bout 2 sets. 1 set of transparent and 1 set of black. I had the black case on my watch (Apple Watch 7 in 45mm) and I was rebuilding my utility trailer and doing some welding work on it. I forgot to take my watch off - and you guessed it, some weld spatter landed on the face of the protective screen. When I had finished welding, I noticed 3 distinct spots where the spatter had landed. The protective case was literally spiderwebbed with cracks all over the face. It was impossible to see the condition of the actual watch face. When I removed the case, to my amazement, the actual watch face was completely unharmed. Not a mark on it.The second time I had the transparent case on the same watch and had just finished a run. I had taken the case off to clean all the sweat from the watch and literally just put the case back on when it slipped from my hands. It landed face down on the concrete foot path. Again the screen protective case was completely spiderwebbed and I could not read the watch face at all. When I removed the case, the actual watch face, was once again, completely unharmed.I have had my watch for about a year and have only used the smiling watch protector since day one - my watch screen looks as good as it did on the day I took it out of the box - all thanks to the Smiling watch protectors!I will not use anything else to protect my watch and have literally given them away to my friends who had nothing on their Apple Watches.Thank you smiling watch protectors for protecting my investment!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Ive been using these Apple Watch cases for over a year now. Im sure they\u2019ve help prevent any damage that could\u2019ve happen to my watch. The 2 pack is perfect, I keep one for everyday use and the other one to use if I want to have the look of a new watch. The case stays firmly on the watch but if you need to remove the case it easy to put on the watch and take off the watch.Looks good, not bulky at all, touch screen works fine with case on, and it definitely protects the watch.Only thing I don\u2019t like is that if you swim or water gets underneath in between the watch and case the touch screen doesn\u2019t work well until you take case off and dry both watch and case or until the water dries own.Other than that it\u2019s a great product.",

The cover does reduce visibility on the screen but I do notice the touch response is not as good with the cover on, but not a major complaint. This item is inexpensive and works id recommend it to others",

Offers great protection for the screen. I didn't protect my previous iterations of the Apple Watch and as a consequence, they all had scratches. My current Apple Watch's screen is in mint condition after 6 months of use. I really recommend this protector.Two caveats :You lose a bit of tactile sensitivity when a rigid protector like this one is used. It's the price to pay to protect your screen.During sweaty workouts, humidity may accumulate between the watch screen and the protector. Tactile sensitivy will decrease until you clean the humidity away.",
