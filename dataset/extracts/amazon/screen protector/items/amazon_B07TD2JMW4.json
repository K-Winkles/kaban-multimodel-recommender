So it took me a little while, but the installation procedures and included items made it go very well. Best installation I have every had. Of note the instructions suggest strongly to watch a video on their website about installation, but for the S10 + phone, there are none on the webstite, only newer phones. The only tricky part is pulling off the back tabs, as one needs to lift them up fairly high, the peel them back from the near center of the screen. That is the only reason I gave a 4 star for ease of installation. The curved edges stuck very well and easily, though I did not think that they were actually sticking. It was only the part that would be removed that actually was not sticking, so that actually was really easy. Screen seems very sensitive and finger print reader works better than ever. Glad I bought this product.",

                "reviewText": "I wish I could give a full five stars!This screen protector was super easy to install ( the easiest to install of any screen protector I have ever used): the stickers and steps are all numbered or labeled and the guide stickers basically make it foolproof. This is the only screen protector I have not had to readjust after placing on my screen (without using tape of course).Highly scratch resistant, and it's awesome they provide 3 screen protectors per package because my phone has some nasty falls and in the span of a year I've gone through all three.I decided to use tempered glass to see if it has a better touch response than my typical, favorite screen protectors (gel protectors) AND IT DOES! Yet, because it is a glass, it is far less durable than the gel protectors and as I said above, I have gone through three of them in the span of a year because one fall that causes a small little crack, continues to spider web across the screen protector. Once those small cracks propagate into large cracks that are going across the entire protector, the touch response goes way down and you will start to get erroneous, false touches on your screen.Regardless, I knew all this going into my purchase and this is some of the best, most responsive tempered glass I've ever used !!!\ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf89Since the Galaxy S10 includes the proximity sensors in the camera well, the tempered glass does not mess with the camera or the face proximity sensor. (Other tempered glass products I've used on other phones have lain across the proximity sensors and because a small fraction of the infrared light bounces off the glass and back into the sensor, my phone thought my face was against it (or was in my pocket) the entire time, and so the screen would not light up.Overall great screen protector.However, and it's a big \"however\", This screen protector does not reach a large chunk of the touchable area on the device's screen (see attached picture) and therefore you cannot control about 2 to 3 mm of your phone, all the way around the edge of the protector. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0fHence, only 4 stars.",

                "reviewText": "I liked the screen protector and it did its job, however I noticed early on that the screen protector appeared to stretch slightly as time went on. When I originally installed it, the front-facing camera cutouts were aligned, however now the screen protector is overlapping with the bottom edges.The reason I'm writing this review is that today after sitting in my pocket, the screen protector suddenly had a large bubble in the center of the screen that I couldn't flatten and I had to remove the screen protector entirely.I liked the installation kit things and the video guides were nice. The TPU felt okay while scrolling and reading text on the screen was about normal.I'll use up the second one in the pack, but I wouldn't buy these again.",

                "reviewText": "I tried this after my 4th screen screen served it's purpose. The feeling is nice to the touch and the first screen ended up with too many bubbles and just didn't align correctly. Over all the ease is a bit simpler than other screens I installed even though first screen didn't work the 2nd worked enough with only bubbles at the very top and bottom of the screen. I tried to force them out with the card provided, but after my attempt started to scratch it I just left it as is. Overall since the provided 2 and the 2nd one went better than the first I would say I will try this again when this one ends up expiring.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this screen protector for my new Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G and, so far, it seems to be working well. It was easy to install on the screen by using the included tools (like the plastic bracket) and the installation video, and I don't have any issues with recognizing touch inputs after installation. I installed the screen protector on my new phone right after taking the phone out of the box, so I didn't do anything special to the phone before installing the protector. For full disclosure, I don't use the fingerprint sensor on my phone anyway, so I can't comment on how well the screen protector works with that. Also, I didn't install the rear camera protector since I don't want to obstruct my camera lenses in any way, so I can't comment on how well the rear camera protector performs. After installing the screen protector, I installed my phone case (a Spigen Rugged Armor Case for the S20 FE 5G) and I didn't have any issues with the screen protector interfering with the phone case or vice versa. Overall, I'm pleased with this screen protector.",

I was a little skeptical because it is so hard to avoid bubbles during installation and it never looks good like the original, and I am not very good at putting screen protectors. For my surprise, the installation video was great and easy to follow. I did exactly as the video instructions and screen protector looks perfect!!!. I would definitely recommend this product !!!",
