                "reviewText": "These protectors have kept my phone in tact since I began using them. They crack from occasional drops, but the phone is always saved from damage with the help of this cover and a back protector.Great price for a three pack. Easy instructions. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\ud83d\udcafUpdateCan not say enough about this screen protector...Thank goodness I had three.My other 4\u2b50\ufe0f review was about to fit over a curved edge screen for the iPhone SE second generation.Despite that one issue for the first install what happens during an issue saved the phone. Having extra screens saved the circumstance even further.These are must-own protectors because they work exceptionally well.My example. During a basic drop, the protector cracked but the screen didn't. I left the slightly cracked screen protector on because it functioned and didn't feel the need to have a new screen on again.About a year goes by. My friend is on the passenger side of the Jeep. Moves the seat.Later that evening I get home. Can't find the phone anywhere.Normally it's in my bag or the median cup holder.Using the find my phone option knows it's I the Wrangler, but still can't find it.Bt this time I\u2019ve rolled the passenger seat forward all the way and back a few times. Can't find the phone.Going over to the passenger side look way under the seat in the mid position meaning middle of the track it slides on. The phone is sticking out about a half-inch from the track crushed under the seat.It\u2019s wedged in so much so it is not removable. At all.I move the seat completely forward shoved it against the window... If you don't have a Jeep, the seat glides fully back or folds forward into the front window off the track.The phone was so wedged into the track face up with a back cover that holds my license and a couple of cards which didn't help.With a bunch of effort was able to unwedge and remove the phone.Amazingly, the protector was crushed in a few spaces. But once removing the actual phone screen was only slightly nicked in two places.I added a new protector to hold the phone screen together while waiting for the repairs the following afternoon.The phone worked with the new protector despite the phone being crushed in two places.Repairs we're complete and the final protect added.I ordered a new pack of protectors to have on hand. Best seven dollars I've ever spent.I can't say thank-you enough for this super economical well explained install protector.Even though my first try didn't get the protection to sit flat this time worked perfectly. The protector sits perfectly flat.\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaf must ownUpdate /\\ more than a year laterUse this screen protector on my iPhone SE 1st gen. Upon reviewing 2nd gen iphone SE reviews decided to purchase. Knowing the risk it wouldn\u2019t stick perfectly around the curved edges.Owning tools for changing an iPhone battery and screen installation find the spatula, with a credit card type of plastic with flexibility could help gentle perfectly assist with sealing the seems.Result, most of the edge sits perfectly on the screen. 1/16th of the edge on one side about an inch long refuses to connect to the screen no matter how much pressure I\u2019ve used with the spatula.I\u2019m not certain if this would affect the ability of the protector to help the phone stay protected.With my SE 1st gen the protector shattered once and the second cracked across the screen at an angle.My previous experience with plastic screens as a part of the protective cover never cracked.My phone did well. No breaks. The protectors appear like bicycle helmets. One use then throw away.The clear plastic screen protectors attached you the cases are more expensive. Unless, you go through protectors like me. Then, maybe it\u2019s worth buying the more expensive case with plastic screen saver.I\u2019ve got three screens with this kit. A nice case. I\u2019m satisfied with the overall appearance and ease of install with my spatula. If you don\u2019t have one use a credit card or any flexible card from your wallet will do well.Even thought the screen instructions say install like a door. My preference is, with the spatula, from top to bottom. Pressing the spatula from one end to the other to get a tight fit.Then, move the spatula around the edges firmly. Until the sides stick.The spatula can also move a tiny bubble out. Press from the middle and move the spatula toward the side. Pushing the ting bubble IF one installed during installation.\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f Four stars. Minus one because I find it impossible install the screen protector perfectly. This may affect the use if the phone drops and the protector isn\u2019t grabbed to the phone. Therefore allowing phone to crack.Make sure to include a hearty strong case, too",

                "reviewText": "I have used this phone protector for past 3 years. The installation is thebeasiest b/c they give you all this stuff to help with the installation of the guard. I have only bought this one pack and it came with 2 or 3 protectors and I just changed to the 2nd one this year, although I should have changed sooner, nonetheless, this protector kept my phone from being scratched and cracked even though the the protector itself was messed up quite a bit. I'm about to order another set only b/c I had to change phones and of course these are not reusable. I will say they do get cracks quite easily, but I also drop my phones a lot..lol. However it still protects the phone. And that is all that matters to me.UPDATE:I received my new set of protectors and everything is the same as before, the only thing is this time, the tape that holds the glass came off as I was trying to apply (twice) so I had to readjust. Don't knownif I didn't apply it enough of the adhesive wasnt as good. Then when I went to put the glass down it didn't seamlessly adhere like before. You always will have a couple of air spots to get out, but this time I had a lot and it was very difficult to get out. I finally did, but had to apply a lot of pressure. I used my thumbs and a credit card, it was never that hard before. Nonetheless, it is on and working good now. Still would recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This set of three tempered glass screen protectors is reasonably priced. Pros: The screen protectors are very sturdy and can be cleaned easily with alcohol wipes. With the protector installed, phone operation is still seamless, and screen visibility is unaltered. Cons: Installation does take a lot of precautions to avoid bubbles (but the manufacturer does provide sticky tabs to help with the process). If this screen gets damaged on the edges, after carefully peeling it off, do not crumple it or try to fold it in half before discarding it as it is made of tempered glass and would leave tiny glass shards in your hands.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve been using these screen protectors for a couple of years now, and they have served me well. They do crack and chip occasionally, which is why I love that they come as multiples in one order. The key thing is that even if the protector cracks, my phone screen does not! These protectors fit both the iPhone SE 2020 and 2022, which I just found out because I broke my SE 2020 and ordered the SE 2022 to replace it. As you can see in the pictures, my old SE 2020 was completely bent away from the screen (I had it in my back pocket when I slipped on icy concrete steps and landed on my butt) however the screen was not cracked at all! I still had one protector leftover from my previous order, and now my new phone is just as safe and secure. 10/10 will buy again! (Also for those who may be wondering, I use the Smartish wallet phone case and that certainly helped protect my phone in the fall as well! I highly recommend their products.)",
