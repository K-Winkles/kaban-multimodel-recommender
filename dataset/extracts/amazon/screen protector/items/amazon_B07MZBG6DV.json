Got rid of one, but the other was right on the side, but wouldn't clear out. After a few minutes, I readjusted the screen a few times, then noticed there was a scratch on that bubble area. Not sure why that would affect that, but I think it did. So tried the 2nd one, and got that one almost perfect. There's some itty bitty tiny bubbles, but they're only slightly visible on the black screen. I'll keep the scratched one as a back up.To use the tray, just snap it on the top of the phone(it says top and bottom on it). Peel the backing off the glass, and lay it down. Then wipe it over with the cloth, then I removed the tray, and smoothed out the bubbles with the cloth. Overall happy with this, especially with the tray.",

Only thing I recommend is using dust remover really good and after snap frame on phone too. I have 3 tiny specs of dust. Hard too see just left it. They got on the screen after put frame on phone I think. I should used dust remover little more, then it would been none at all.",
