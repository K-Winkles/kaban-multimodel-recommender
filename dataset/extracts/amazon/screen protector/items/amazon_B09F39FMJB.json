The plastic flexibility is the exact reason why we call it tempered glass screen protector. Tempered glass is a type of safety glass that is stronger than ordinary glass. 2. It cannot be seen from the appearance that it is glass or plastic. As a customer, what can we do to identify it? There is an easy, quick, cost-effective way to test it yourself, and it's very accurate. Most plastics have a melting point between 160 and 210 degrees Celsius, and glass materials are at least over 1400 degrees Celsius, so is there a lighter around? 3. Does it come with a cleaning wipe to use prior to placing on the phone? Yes, the package includes:4*Guide Stickers, 4*Wet Wipe&4*Dry Wipe,2*Dust Absorber. 4. How can I remove bubbles? Use the kit in the package to clean the screen before placing the screen protector. If there are bubbles,try to gently press the bubbles with your finger or with a ruler,but the screen surface needs a thin cloth pad to avoid scratching the protector. 5. How can I remove a cracked glass screen protector? Lift the screen protector with the card from any corner of the screen protector, then hold the corner and remove slowly. (If you find CHIP or CRACK on the screen protector, for your safety, please wear gloves when removing the screen protector.)",

I asked my mom to check from different angles, she couldn\u2019t see anything. She can only see it if she stands right behind me and the phone is facing straight. The only con is it is very easily to crack but it protects the phone screen well. I cracked the screen protector twice and am using the third one, the phone screen is intact without any scratches. I didn\u2019t drop my phone at all, the screen protectors cracked when I opened my car door holding the phone in the same hand, it cracked that easily.",

I bought the first one of these out of desperation because my usual store did not have the size for my phone and I was going out of town.These are nice thick glass. So you know if you drop it on its face, it isn't going to hurt the phone. I am known for being abusive to my phones...I'm just very active and adventurous. Yes, I break my screens a lot, but at least now I don't have to pay $20 bucks a pop. These are easy to install and they look great, I love the privacy screen - it works really well. I can tell you that you won't be disappointed with this product - I have bought many packs for all our phones at home, and I keep a supply of spares due to my \"Activity\".",
