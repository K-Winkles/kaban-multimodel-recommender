                "reviewText": "I am very particular when it comes to screen protectors. First off, I don't like them. I don't like the way they look and inevitably I always end up with one small bubble that drives me crazy. Maybe its my OCD, I don't know. When it's been necessary I've used Spigen screen protectors in the past because they would include an alignment tool that made installing them very simple. However with the iPhone 12 mini I almost bought a different brand because I don't like the screen protector cut out around the front facing camera. I'd rather the screen protector cover all of the glass on the front of the screen. Because I had used Spigen before I decided to stick with what I know. I'm very glad I did. This alignment tool that comes with the screen protector is the slickest thing out there right now. The screen protector is perfectly aligned and there are no bubbles and no flaws whatsoever. This was the easiest and best install ever. It works perfect, there is no screen lag at all, it works just as if nothing was on the screen. I haven't drop tested it for obvious reasons. Other than the cut out around the front camera you can't even tell there is a screen protector on the phone. I do wish Spigen would make a screen protector that covered the entire front screen but other than that, this product is amazing. I'm definitely a fan of the Spigen brand and will stick with them for my future products.",

                "reviewText": "I would recommend this product to ANYONE with an iPhone. I know for myself, I\u2019m an absolute freak when it comes to protecting my screen and not getting it scratched. I\u2019ve used several screen protectors before, many of them have been a tempered glass film that you lay over on your own over the phone screen. While those are okay, I find that it bothers me if it is not put on absolutely perfect with no bubbles or specks of dust underneath. I also have had screen protectors that hinder the touch screen functionality. My experience with them previously have been very lack luster, leading me to abandon them all together and just replacing the screen if it ever cracked.If this describes your previous experience with screen protectors on your phone, THIS PRODUCT IS FOR YOU. The plastic screen applier that this screen comes in is AMAZING. It comes with step-by-step instructions on how to apply the screen protector to your phone screen. After you apply the screen protector, it is PERFECT. It is completely symmetrical with no imperfections since the plastic applier has been 3D printed to fit the dimensions of your phone down to the thousandth of a millimeter. The box also comes with a screen cleaner and dust stickers to clean your screen with and remove dust easily before applying the screen protector. If your screen cracks or something goes wrong, THE BOX COMES WITH TWO TEMPERED GLASS SCREENS. This product is amazing and I would recommend this a million times over. I should also add that I have seen zero loss of functionality in the touch screen. It feels like it is not there at all, which is what I want, but I also have the peace of mind knowing if I do drop my phone, it will be protected. I know what product I will be purchasing again if I ever get a new phone.",

Just make sure that you follow everything that the instructions say to do and you will actually have a pretty good screen protector placed on your phone. I rate this a five mostly because it's so easy and I wish that other phones like galaxy's can have something like this too :)",

A screen protector for my iPhone 12 Mini that doesn\u2019t buckle & bubble with my OtterBox Defender case\u2026YAY\u203c\ufe0fI will NOT compromise my iPhone OtterBox Defender Cases for ANYTHING! Unfortunately the one for my iPhone 12 Mini doesn\u2019t have a built-in screen protector\u2026so I have to buy them separately. However\u2026it was sooooooo annoying to have the last few screen protectors buckle/bubble up because it was either too big or off center.THIS one is PERFECT \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb I\u2019m in my 70\u2019s\u2026and I installed it perfectly the very first time from the instruction video link provided in the box\u2026so I now have the extra one for later if I need it.I found it very easy to put on withOUT air bubbles and/or dust stuck underneath. I am SO HAPPY to have purchased this!THANK YOU\u2763\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "My current phone is the first in a long time for me to use a screen protector. But after several phones ending their lives with mild display scratches that did annoy me a bit, I decided to protect this one. My first purchase was a failure and almost made me change my mind about the whole deal. Then I decided to try the spigen.Application of this protector is easy. My only complaint is how wasteful it is. But I realized I literally don\u2019t touch the actual protector until it\u2019s fully applied, which likely aids in its quality of application and longevity.Unlike the first brand I purchased, there\u2019s no issues with the adhesive so far. After weeks, it looks as good as the day I applied it.My only complaint is the fitment doesn\u2019t make it as invisible as I would like. The first brand I got was much closer to the edges and only had a cutout for the speaker, not the entire notch. The sensors worked fine through the other protector, the adhesive just kept failing on it. So the edges of this one are ever present.Overall I recommend it. The applicator is nearly stupid proof. If you follow the directions you get no bubbles. There\u2019s no lift nor other adhesive failure. And you get extra. This is also a brand that has been around a while and not a fly by night brand that will change names in 6 months.",

All I had to do was refer to the write up here, the enclosed instructions and bring up the video for a step by step visual (video location is in instructions). I installed on a new phone out of the box so was able to skip the dust / cleaning step. I was skeptical that it would fit like a glove. I thought I would mess that up. Not at all! The tool they include makes it goof proof :) It\u2019s on perfectly aligned. Also, I\u2019m using it with a Spigen case and they work perfectly together. I\u2019ve had no issues with screen response and that includes perfect side, top and bottom navigation/gestures. Also, visible finger prints and swipe smudges are not excessive (easily cleaned with the included cleaning cloth anyway). Durability - I will have to see how it performs; it is too soon to really tell. I like that it comes with a spare screen just in case. Bottom line - I highly recommend!",
