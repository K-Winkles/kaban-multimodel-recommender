                "reviewText": "I bought this when I got my new S21, and initially was somewhat unhappy- like others have mentioned the quality looks good, and its easy to install, there's no bubbles and I even tried to wash and reapply it once. The finger print reader does lose some sensitivity, but I found an easy fix for this- when the reader wont register, I noted that moistening the finger (in any way eg water drop, hand sanitizer or even licking) and then pressing down on the FP reader usually fixes the issue most of the times.My problem was that, at the top right corner the screen protector lifts off slightly leaving a small 4mmX4mm air bubble that does not spread- only happens on the top right corner on my phone- I cycled through 2 protectors and complained to the company with photos and they sent a free replacement- I put a new one on (my 3rd) and again the same problem. I then accepted that this was either a manufacturing issue with this screen protector, or an uneven area on my phone, and left it on, with plans to try another brand later- until today that is.Today I dropped my phone while holding under my chin- a 5- 5.5 ft drop onto a hard wooden floor. It was a hard knock and my phone had this screen protector and was also in the S view flip coever made by Samsung. I noted fine cracks- I initially thought it was my phone screen, but on closer exam, there was small glass pieces coming off of the screen protector- the screen protector had taken the brunt of the impact- see photo. This screen protector saved my phone screen today. I have now applied my last one on and am ordering a new set.Not sure why phone manufacturers cant put a better quality glass on a $900-1000 device that is thin smooth and slippery and prone to being dropped, but thats a different story",

I like that they are self healing and for me lasted 6-8 months before I replaced to keep the phone looking good. I'm fairly rough on phones.Anyway I purchased both a set of film and glass protectors now with the s21. I have 4 phone in my family so figured I would see what works better with the new design and finger print scanner.First was the film. Easy install soft feel on fingers. Case friendly. Then the glass. Super easy install. Super smooth surface. Both have the glass camera lense cover. Work well.Finger print recognition works well with both film and glass. Now I installed the protectors before setting anything up. I know some say they have issue with it working. Normally my fingers don't work but I thought I would test on the new phone with these and they work just fine.Overall my preference at this time is the glass. Just a better feel. Also case friendly.",

                "reviewText": "If you follow all the instructions this screen protector should work great for you. I've done a few of these before so it was easy to install. The finger print reader didn't work great right away but started to read better after a few days. The touch screen works fine a majority of the time. I had a few issues but if you turn on the sensitive touch in you settings any issues you might be having should go away. Also rescan in your fingerprint on occassion if you're having issues and keep your screen clean will reduce issues as well. This does show more smudges than without the protector so I have to clean my screen a little more often. I have had no issues with air bubbles or it peeling up on the edges like I've had with other brands.",

                "reviewText": "The quality of the screen protector feels good.However, since putting it on my fingerprint scanner doesn't recognize my finger print about half the time. I tried updating my fingerprint in my phone and it helped a little edit, but still fails to consistently identify my fingerprint.Putting the protector on was a bit of a pain. The guide rail provided was an okay fit but was more in the way when trying to put the screen on. It doesn't help that the stickers they provide to help you put the screen on were not very sticky. After about 5 minutes of trying to put the screen on I was finally able to get it on.When I did get it on the placement was slightly off being just a little bit more down than it should be.Overall okay though.",

                "reviewText": "This screen protector went on perfectly, the first time. The alignment guide they provide made for a precise fit, and by following the included video instructions, the screen \"purged\" itself of any air bubbles, almost like magic. Once installed, it's a simple task of deleting the registered fingerprint(s) (if you use biometrics), and re-learning them to account for the new \"glass\" - couldn't be simpler.This is the third time I've installed this product (because, unfortunately, my phone gets beaten up a lot), and if not for this product, I'd be out at least a couple of very expensive screens.",

Bon, je l'ai mis un peu de travers mais c'est un d\u00e9tail. J'ai une coque qui revient sur l'\u00e9cran de mon S21 (une Spigen ultra hybride achet\u00e9e aussi sur Amazon). La protection a pu \u00eatre install\u00e9e sans probl\u00e8me car elle est un peu plus petite que l'\u00e9cran. Donc c'est impeccable.Elle est hyper agr\u00e9able au niveau sensation. J'ai vraiment l'impression de toucher l'\u00e9cran du t\u00e9l\u00e9phone.Elle ne graisse pas.Et enfin, et pas des moindres au sujet des empreintes.... tous ceux qui disent que les empreintes ne sont pas reconnues, vous n'avez pas respect\u00e9 les recommandations du fabricant !Reprenez vos empreintes dans le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone apr\u00e8s la pose du film. Une fois que c'est fait, c'est impeccable. Alors oui, c'est un peu moins sensible. Mais franchement, couplez cela avec la reconnaissance faciale et vous n'aurez aucun probl\u00e8me.Honn\u00eatement c'est le meilleur verre tremp\u00e9 que j'ai install\u00e9 depuis looonnngtemps! Merci au fabriquant!Si vous avez appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 ce commentaire laissez un like. \ud83d\ude09",
