                "reviewText": "When I upgraded (of necessity) to a new iPhone SE 2020, I bought a tempered glass screen protector and case at the same time, as I didn\u2019t want to risk damage to my new phone. I wondered that the screen protector didn\u2019t seem to cover the whole screen, but learned that most of them were like that. Before I\u2019d had it three weeks, one corner chipped off the screen protector, then another part chipped and a hairline crack grew from that. In order to replace it under warranty, I had to order it from the company\u2014for an additional fee, on top of the excessive price I\u2019d paid for it. And to add insult to injury, they didn\u2019t have the kind I\u2019d originally bought, so offered me, instead, an \u201cupgrade\u201d\u2014to a model that was actually a downgrade; it normally costs half what the original model cost. I wasn\u2019t about to throw more good money after bad. I chalked the loss up to experience and after some research found this Manto screen protector. I got two screen protectors for almost a third of what I\u2019d paid for the inadequate first one, and this one really fits my screen. The package came with a separate installation kit for each protector, which made the installation quick, easy and bubble-free. As an added bonus, the glass is crystal clear, nicely sensitive and resists finger prints beautifully. I couldn\u2019t be happier with it.Update: A few days ago, I knocked a pottery cup full of small grooming utensils from a high shelf right onto my phone on the counter below. The screen protector shattered--instead of the screen. It did exactly what it was supposed to do. The screen was completely undamaged. This was the second in my set of two (the first cracked from the edge for some other reason, but I'd had it for quite awhile.) I immediately ordered another set, got them on Saturday (yesterday) and installed the first right away. There was one spot that didn't seem to stick to the screen the way it should. I e-mailed the company immediately and got a response within hours! I had sent a picture and asked if there was something I could do about the problem. There was, apparently, a bit of dust--invisible to my naked eye--and they gave me clear instructions to remove the protector and clean it and the screen again with the dust sticker (one of the items in the installation kit that makes it so easy to get a good result.) In the same e-mail, they offered to refund me $4.00, in lieu of sending a replacement, but the reinstallation seems to have worked satisfactorily.At $11.68 for two excellent protectors, a separate installation kit for each, and a frame that makes it super quick and easy to lay the protector in place, you can't go wrong. But the superb customer service is what spurred me to add this coda to my original review.",

                "reviewText": "I chose this product because it had a circle for the phone's button instead of an arch shape. I think the cut-out arch for the button is unsightly, but surprisingly every product that I viewed uses that now. But this one had a closed circle for the hole, and was also tempered glass. (But noting that the closed hole is not available in the clear version of the screen protector. I purchased the black.)The fit was quite good. The enclosed guide you use to position the screen protector was very simple and fool-proof to use. There is no way for that aspect to go wrong if you snap your phone into it properly.I saw another review complaining that the edges overhung the phone's beveled corners, but did not find that to be the case for me. The screen protector follows the curve precisely, with no overhang anywhere. Getting the bubbles out took more time than with a previous brand. But, it was quite easy to lift edges and corners up and drop them down to encourage stubborn bubbles to disappear. I was even able to easily lift the entire screen protector completely off and just reapply it again for a restart. I do recommend spending some time on this because it eventually pays off: flawless and no bubbles. It took me about a dozen lifts and drops and a bit of rubbing to get there, but the the final product is perfect. Make sure you are working on a dust-free surface during this process. I covered a table in paper towels to create a clean working area.Finally, just to note what I did for the case: I use Red Bubble's \"tough case\" for my phones. There was no issue with compatibility with this protector. Due to the design of the phone itself, there is a trough all the way around between the case and protector, which actually lends texture and is attractive. Very happy with my purchase of this screen protector.",

                "reviewText": "Just purchased my second one of these after the first one cracked when the phone was dropped. It suffered a hairline fracture horizontally across the glass, but I guess it did its job since the phone's screen beneath was unharmed. I was even able to continue using it for a few weeks and the crack on the glass did not continue to spread.The best thing about this protector is how easy it is to install. This is a far cry from the 'bomb-diffusing' stress of installing the film screen protectors of yesteryear. For this glass screen protector you just clean your phone of dust and lay the protector down on the phone. It adheres itself without any effort, and ZERO air bubbles. It's also very forgiving if you need to peel it back off a couple of times to better align it with the home button and speaker.Once it's in place, it's almost impossible to tell you have a screen protector on the phone. There is a slightly raised edge around the home button which gives it a different tactile feel - it doesn't bother me at all, but you have to be a little more direct when wiping off the home button during a cleaning. I like to wipe my phone down daily at the same time I clean my eye glasses. The glass itself is quite resistant to fingerprints and it cleans up nicely with an alcohol lens cloth. It never accumulated any scratches while I had it, so it\u2019s definitely tough glass.The only negative I can think of is that it tends to collect a very narrow strip of dust between the perimeter of the glass and the edge of the phone case. It's not a big deal - just blast it with an air duster every once in a while and you're good to go.If I suffer another drop that cracks the glass screen protector, I would confidently purchase a third one of these. Great product.",

                "reviewText": "I was apprehensive about any new screen protector due to the many issues I\u2019ve faced with them. This screen protector is bang on perfect, finally a glass protector that is actual glass. Installing it was easy, it fits flush and the guide actually works and isn\u2019t just a plastic boarder.Installing - It took 2 attempts to fit it, attempt 1 was bad because as I was laying it down some dust shot under. Attempt 2, I carefully pulled it back off and used the sticker for dust removal (tip- gently use the sticker to grad dust on the protector itself if the above happens)Material - It feels like quality material, it feels like glass, very smooth and has a weighted touch to it. I\u2019d say that\u2019s a personal thing, I personally like it to feel glossy and \u201cweighted\u201d. Even the white boarder is glass and not that weird plastic others use. Don\u2019t let that put you off, the touch screen still works perfect, no lag, no delay, no missed touches.Bubbling - Bubbling is (mostly) down to user error, but can also be down to shoddy products. Companies should focus on the edges as no-one wants a screen protector that will have bubbles around the edge and hear the excuse \u201cbecause the iPhone SE has a curved edge\u201d that\u2019s not good enough. For me I personally don\u2019t like seeing a gap between scree protectors and cases. As I said above, I had 2 attempts because of 1 bubble. I removed the dust placed the protector back into the guide, et voila. Done, no bubbles, no marks, no nothing.Edge protection - no most protectors have that gap around the border which is fine, but as mentioned there\u2019s a fine line before it will bubble. This screen protector has edging, so even if it bubbled around the edge you wouldn\u2019t see it. It fits into my case easy and without issue. I have a MOUS case, I concerned that the screen protector would have an issue with it. Nope it fits very snug, if it didn\u2019t have the white border you wouldn\u2019t know it\u2019s there.After working in a phone shop for years I\u2019ve had the chance to fit many screen protectors, in fact I became awesome at it. Fast forward to this year and I\u2019ve gone through 18 protectors. At first I though I lost my touch but after inspecting the protector I noticed something they all had in common, the way they\u2019re built.The iPhone SE has a curved edge most of the protectors I had were just a fraction too wide it left an edge bubble all the way round. The only thing I could do was put washing up liquid around the edge to stop the happening. Another thing they had in common was the claim on \u201cno bubbles\u201d air bubbles usually come down to incorrect installation, again I noticed this wasn\u2019t the case. Because they didn\u2019t sit flush around the edge it allowed air to trap itself. No matter how much you pushed the air it would keep bubbling. Lastly, they were \u201cglass\u201d which is in-fact false, most were too bendy to be that. And if it had the borders around the edge they were plastic, the screen protectors felt like acrylic as opposed to glass.Now for the pros & consPros- quality feel- change the boarder from black to white- easy to install- looks premium- no bubbling (take your time and remove the dust over an over again)- price (well priced for what it is)- extended warrantyCons- instructions in broken English- link to the install video only shows the iPhones that are full screen and both like the iPhone SE 2020.- would like to see a range of colour if possible for the borderIt gets a 5 purely because it deserves it, I\u2019m hugely critical with screen protectors. Perhaps any other reviews I\u2019ve done were through rose tinted glasses as they weren\u2019t very good overall.(I would post a picture but I can\u2019t take a photo of my own phone as I don\u2019t have another one to do that with)",

Beides vereint dieses Panzerglas wie ich finde sehr gut. 9H, 0,33mm Dicke, passgenaue Form, kratzfest. All das spricht doch sehr f\u00fcr dieses Panzerglas. Blaulichtfilter ist angegeben aber schwer zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen. Sicherlich reduziert es den Blaulichtanteil nicht besonders, da sollte man den iPhone eigenen Filter aktivieren. Weniger Fingerabdr\u00fccke und Schmutz bleiben auf dem Panzerglas, sind aber definitiv noch vorhanden. Da sollte man keine Kunstst\u00fccke bei dem Preis erwarten.Benutzung:Die Installation ist spielend leicht. Extrem wichtig ist ein absolut makelloses Display bevor man die Folie anbringt und das man die neue Folie nicht auf der Unterseite ber\u00fchrt. Sonst gibt es Flecken und Fussel und Bl\u00e4schen unter der Folie die nie mehr weggehen.Erstmal angebracht bringt sie genau das wof\u00fcr sie da ist: Soliden Schutz bei St\u00fcrzen.Fazit:F\u00fcr knapp \u00fcber 3\u20ac pro St\u00fcck bekommt man wahrscheinlich kein besseres Panzerglas.",
