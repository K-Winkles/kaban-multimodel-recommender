I can only comment about the iPhone 13 Pro Max, because that\u2019s what I ordered it for, but I didn\u2019t have any spacing or lining up or coverage issues with the screen protector on the front or the camera. I would definitely buy this again, very happy with this purchase.The box that it comes in is great, too since it comes with three each of the camera and screen protectors. So you\u2019ll have a place to store it and won\u2019t forget about it, and it won\u2019t be damaged. These guys are doing it right!",
