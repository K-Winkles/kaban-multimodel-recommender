The plastic flexibility is the exact reason why we call it tempered glass screen protector. Tempered glass is a type of safety glass that is stronger than ordinary glass. 2. It cannot be seen from the appearance that it is glass or plastic. As a customer, what can we do to identify it? There is an easy, quick, cost-effective way to test it yourself, and it's very accurate. Most plastics have a melting point between 160 and 210 degrees Celsius, and glass materials are at least over 1400 degrees Celsius, so is there a lighter around? 3. Does it come with a cleaning wipe to use prior to placing on the phone? Yes, the package includes: Guide Stickers, Wet Wipe & Dry Wipe, Dust Absorber. 4. How can I remove bubbles? Use the kit in the package to clean the screen before placing the screen protector. If there are bubbles,try to gently press the bubbles with your finger or with a ruler,but the screen surface needs a thin cloth pad to avoid scratching the protector. 5. How can I remove a cracked glass screen protector? Lift the screen protector with the card from any corner of the screen protector, then hold the corner and remove slowly. (If you find CHIP or CRACK on the screen protector, for your safety, please wear gloves when removing the screen protector.)",

You really have to pay attention and use the tabs they give you, once it touches - it's on. Went perfectly, moved a little but it is fine. No bubbles at all. You start where the glass touches in the middle and run your finger up(or Down) then from center push out to the edges. It does feel thinner than the original one, but we are not hard on our phones. Then I installed one on my i6s, had to remove the plastic screen from the otterbox first. Again, it went fine, no bubbles. What a difference from the old plastic. Both Camera's work fine.Phones and Cases needed a good cleaning first. Will update if I have an issue. Installed 2/9/24",

                "reviewText": "I followed a tutorial from YouTube for perfect placement. Basically you lay the protector on the phone to align it (don't peel yet) and use 3 of the included stickers to attach it to the right side of the phone. Then flip the protector to the right (like opening a book). Clean the phone screen and remove all lint. Then slowly peel the plastic and flip the protector back onto the phone (like closing a book). Worked really well for me",

                "reviewText": "There are many screen protectors out there, and generally speaking, I haven\u2019t been able to tell a big difference from one to the others as far as protection goes. What I have seen a difference in is in the ease of application, reduction in screen bubbles, or some enhanced features like screen privacy.This screen is a basic screen and, for the price, it seems to be a good screen.As far as any enhanced features, this screen does not have viewing angle privacy or any additional screen application features like a cradle. The directions aren\u2019t that great either - they don\u2019t tell you how to use the screen guide stickers: If you have applied these before, you know that you can use them as either hinges or as levers to move the glass into place without touching the sticky screen while maneuvering. This can be tricky - and the more careful and precise you are with the screen preparation (cleaning, etc.) and positioning, the less likely you are to have a crooked protector or bubbles. That being said, I used 4 stickers as a hinge and still ended up with some bubbles.One other point about the box. The box has an \u201ceasy open\u201d tab. I wouldn\u2019t say it was easier than others I have purchased, but it is on the box. One thing I would say is that because of how this opens, it makes for less optimal storage of the remaining 2 screen protectors as the box can no longer close (see photo). Maybe not a big deal, but something to consider.The bottom line is that if you are looking for a decent screen protector for the price and have applied these before, this should work fine. If you have had trouble applying protectors or are a bit of a perfectionist, I would suggest buying one that has included guides or carriers that facilitate applying the screen protector.",
