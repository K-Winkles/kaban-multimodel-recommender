                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars By Far the Easiest Installation of Any Screen Cover",
                "reviewText": "This makes for a very easy review. Ever since we started putting screen covers on our mobile/cell phones a little over a decade ago, the procedure has been a nightmare. Most of us live in a dusty, dirty urban or dusty rural environment which gives rise to dust and/and or dirt particles in the air\u2014even inside our homes, apartments, condos or town homes. There\u2019s simply no getting around it. So, putting a glass screen protector on an iPhone or similar is practically impossible without issue. Our hands shake and other things we can\u2019t control occur causing the placement of the protector to go onto the phone\u2019s screen off-kilter. In my experience, I have never yet been completely successful in placing a glass screen protector on a phone\u2019s screen EXACTLY as it was meant to be. UNTIL NOW!Spigen has finally come up with the answer. Since my last phone was the iPhone 7+ which was purchased over two years ago, this method used by Spigen might not be brand new, but it\u2019s new to ME and could be new to you. AND IT\u2019S FANTASTIC.Before starting the installation process make sure you have removed the somewhat hard to remove heat-dried thin plastic lining that Spigen lines the outside and inside of the Ultra Hybrid Case (assuming you are using one of the Spigen cases to go along with the Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector. Failure to do so will cause you to use the second screen protector provided in the box by Spigen).Following their instructions, this NEARLY eliminates all possibility for error. As always, they provide all the tools necessary for installation; and to that end, Spigen has added an installation tray to ease the pain. Once you have used the wet cloth for cleaning the screen and phone if you desire to, I recommend laying the cleaned phone on a flour-bag kitchen towel because of the lack of lint. Then I use their provided soft microfiber cloth to wipe down any streaks left by the wet cloth and any remaining fingerprints or other debris left that have settled onto the phone\u2019s screen at no fault of your own.After all that is done, I blow my phone\u2019s screen off with non-moist canned air as an added precaution (air not provided). Then you should use any of the four (4) stickers provided to lift off any still-invisible particles before the final stage. Next, peel the cover off the plastic installation kit and place the phone screen-down into the installation case/kit. Turn it over and place the phone now inside the kit on something lint free such as the aforementioned flour-sack towel. The instructions to all these steps are on a small piece of paper in animation form without words. On this now-obverse side face-up, written instructions tell you to push your finger from the top to the bottom of the slit that is carved out of this side of the plastic kit\u2014this helps press the glass screen protector to the phone\u2019s screen. After 30 seconds, remove the tape that covers the slot, and lift this case away from the phone.With the phone face-up, immediately take the non-handled squeegee and from the center of the screen rub toward the outer edges of the screen until the bubbles are completely removed.If after doing this, one or more bubbles seem to linger with a dot in the middle, this is caused by a tiny speck of dust or dirt that landed on the phone\u2019s screen even after you cleaned off the screen. As I said, it\u2019s virtually impossible to live in a completely clean environment. Although it has been the suggestion by manufacturers to lift up the screen only as far as necessary to attempt to remove the small speck, and then lay down the cover again, and use the squeegeee to stick the glass protector back onto the screen to rub out the bubble, I strongly don\u2019t recommend it because I have found that once removed, it never sticks to the screen as well the second time as it did the first time. It\u2019s best to leave well enough alone or to purchase another Spigen Screen Protector and try again. Remember, there are two complete sets in each box. So with each attempt, you always have two tries before being forced to purchase another.This particular glass protector does not lessen any feel of touch by finger or stylus away were it not placed on the screen one iota. Highly recommended for it\u2019s quality and lack of loss or feel of touch, and especially for it\u2019s ease\u2014finally\u2014of installation.Whether or not you purchase a Spigen Case for your Mobile Phone, all smartphones need protecting by a Tempered Glass Screen Protector and with Spigen\u2019s latest case and provided tools to use to install these screen protectors, Spigen has risen above the masses of manufacturers by taking the guesswork of how to place the screensaver onto the screen as well as making it the most foolproof installation\u2014ever!",

This is an almost foolproof installation system; take you time, follow directions and you can do it. My wife came to me recently to say she cracked her iPhone screen. No, she had just cracked the protector.. it did it's job!!This purchase was a replacement for her and I bought another to have a spare for me.",

                "reviewText": "Wow, this was really easy to install. Please, do yourself a favor and watch the YOUTUBE video a couple of times BEFORE you start!I purchased iPhone 11's for my brother and nephew, who are notorious for breaking screens and phones. To save the headache, I bought (2) cases (it was UAG I believe) and (2) sets of these UNBREAKcable Screen Protector. Each set comes with (3) screen protectors, and believe me, I needed the extra one.I watched the video, but I thought using the sticker after I wiped down the NEW phones was a waste of time and skipped the step. DOH! DON'T DO THAT - use the sticker and re-trace your steps. Dust is tiny, tiny, and monstrous. It snuck on the first phone install, as did bubbles under the glass. Well, because I didn't watch the video close enough - DOH!I tried again, used the stickers, FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS, and voila! Perfect... looked pristine, clear glass, no bubbles, no worries. The COOLEST thing is that you get it lined up with a guidance thingie, and then you simply TOUCH THE CENTER of the protector, and it attaches like magic. This helps seal out the bubbles, but if you mess up, they have some info on how you can take it off and try again. Just READ AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS, unlike I did at first... lol.After I removed the guidance thingie they provided, I smoothed out the edges by using the cloth provided, just to make sure it was connected entirely to the phone. Beautiful... smooth... showroom quality.After both were installed, I put them in their phone cases. If you have to switch out a SIM card, you can hold off on the last part until you've done that step.The rep at the T-Mobile store (went there with them to make sure they were set up, I'm not their phone tech... lol) commented that the screen protectors were perfect. He asked (and maybe you will too) why I bought an extra set.My nephew drops his phone ALL THE TIME. I fully expect him to crack the screen protector at some point. If they have the new ones, they can look online, take off the broken protector, and re-install another one.ANY PROTECTOR CAN BREAK. If it breaks, that means that it has probably protected the actual screen from breaking. I'd rather replace the protectors several times in the life of the phone than replace the phone. He broke his phone so bad last time that it wouldn't ring anymore. That's not very safe... and he didn't want to use a case.Buy a case and use it. Buy these protectors and use them... buy extra! Be sure to get the right size for your phone, and try this particular brand. It's fantastic, and the cost is very reasonable.If this has helped you at all, please give me a HELPFUL vote, and feel free to ask me any questions. Have a great year!",
