The protector adhered seamlessly to my phone's screen without a single bubble in sight.The camera lens protector is an added bonus, and I appreciate the thoughtful design that ensures a perfect alignment. It's great to know that both my screen and camera lens are well-protected without compromising the functionality or aesthetics of my device.Overall, the amFilm Easiest Installation OneTouch for iPhone 15 Pro Max is a fantastic investment for anyone looking to safeguard their device without the headache of a complicated installation process. I highly recommend this product to fellow iPhone users who value quality, ease of use, and top-notch protection for their devices.",

                "reviewText": "This kit is the most comprehensive that I've ever seen for a screen protector. Everything was professionally packaged. The instructions are clear. Application was easy. The few bubbles were easily removed by slightly lifting the edge and wiping away using the included tool. Fitment is excellent, leaving about 1 mm all around between the screen protector edge and the Apple case. Hopefully the screen protector will prove to be durable.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using amFilm screen protectors since the iPhone 7 and they continue to provide good low cost protection. And the current installation guide frame is a great improvement over the old \"hinge\" method. But quality control is lacking regarding the frame's fit and protector placement.PROBLEMS1) As to protector placement, it is not well centered within the guide frame. Since its placement on the phone is relative to the frame, this misalignment is then transferred to the phone after installation. It\u2019s not off by much, but since the screen protector barely covers the lit portion of the phone\u2019s display, some color fringing may be visible along one of the top or side edges.2) As to fit, the guide frame is positioned and centered on the phone by plastic tabs on all four sides. These tabs slide along the sides of the phone when putting the guide frame on. The trouble is it fits too tightly when fully seated onto the phone. While they will flex to fit properly when enough pressure is applied, they may also scratch the side of your pristine new phone in the process.SOLUTIONS1) Regarding the protector placement, visually check the guide/protector assembly before installation. Look closely at the spacing between the outside edges of the screen protector and the inside surface of the frame\u2019s alignment tabs. That spacing distance should be the same for each pair (8 in all) of opposing tabs. If not, you can realign the protector to the alignment frame. They are temporarily held together by small patches of adhesive at the four corners. Simply and slowly press the protector away from the frame towards the phone side of the guide being careful not to cause the front protective film to separate from the glass protector. You probably will only need to (and want to) do this at two corners at a time. That will keep the protector attached, but allow you to shift the protector enough to correct a slight misalignment. Pick the two corners next to whichever pair of tabs you\u2019re trying to adjust.2) Regarding the guide frame, first test how snuggly it fits on your phone as-is. If it slips on easily up to its built-in stops and is fully seated, you don\u2019t need to do anything. But if it only partially fits before requiring significant force to fully seat, stop and remove it. Grab the frame along opposing sides and \u201cgently\u201d twist and hold them for a few seconds in the directions that would move the tabs away from the phone. Do this for each pair of opposing tabs (side-to-side and top-to-bottom) to loosen the tight fit. Keep in mind it\u2019s only plastic, so be careful not to break it. It will also tend to spring back to it\u2019s original (tight) shape after a short while, so do this just before attempting to install it on your phone.If you\u2019re not picky about your protector\u2019s alignment, the alignment guide will do an adequate job out-of-the-box and probably not scratch your phone in the process. If you are, I hope this helps. But I also assume no responsibility for any damage my advice might cause to this product or your phone\u2026 do at your own risk.",
