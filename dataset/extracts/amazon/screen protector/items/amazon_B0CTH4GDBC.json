Screen protector went on smooth the first time with no bubbles does not interfere with the touch screen or the fingerprint sensor. Also, I think the camera protector is an interesting touch. I don't know if it's if it's necessary, but with the way that the camera sticks out on the pixel 8 pro seems like a good idea.So far has not cracked and has not allowed my screen to crack. I have not been too rough on it yet, but so far it seems to be working well.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Update: It is now July 2021 and I just ordered a replacement. I'd like to say the case was damaged in a fight with the Klingons but that would be a lie.Overall I've been pleased with the case. The little ring thing snapped off early on and I'm not sure how since I never used the thing. I just noticed the ring and wondered what it was, then I realized it was from the phone case. Not a big deal for me but it might be for you.Sorry about the image quality, I'm not that great with 21st century technology.Original review: I've been using this for about a month and had no problems so far. I have a REVVLRY+ that I bought in June 2020 and spent quite a bit of time looking though cases trying to find one that fits and this does. Since my household has four children and two distracted and sleep deprived parents I wanted something that would protect it first and looks were second. (But secretly I also wanted it to look cool.) While I don't let my children use my phone they do run around like the cast to a Lord of the Flies movie and it's not inconceivable that they would do something to cause it damage by crashing into me, dropping something on my purse, or perhaps bringing the house down around it. Pure chaos here, cannot predict future.It came down to this and another one and I went with this one because another reviewer said it looked like a Star Wars toy. As a sci-fi fan (more Trek than Wars but whatever) that was the tie breaker. I figured it might make me feel like I'm out on a mission when I whip out my phone to call home to find out if we need more green apples or red ones. Rich in imagination, me.Surprisingly it hasn't been truly tested yet. It's hasn't been dropped or hit or used as a bludgeon on an annoying sibling. When that happens I'll come back and update how it handled the trauma.This is my first real cell phone so perhaps I'm not as picky as others are. The camera hole is very slightly too small so the other REVVLRY+ reviewers are technically correct. It's possible I'm just too naive about how much of a problem this is to be worried. If it turns out to cause a problem I'll update, but right now I'm not too concerned about that.I was able to find a tempered glass screen protector to put on it. Ironically the review of this product complained that the lip on it prevented a screen protector from being applied and the screen protector I bought complained that it was too small to cover the whole screen. I decided to take the chance that this case and that protector were soul mates and they seem to be a match made in Heaven.I haven't used the little hinged loop thing that I think is meant to be a built in stand. I'm too old to try to watch videos on a screen the size of my palm. If I'm watching a movie it will be on my home projector. Not sure what other uses the little loop-stand would have. Did I mention this is my first real cell phone? Feel free to laugh at my ignorance, all my friends do.For any other sensory seekers out there, the red parts of this case have a lovely velvety, satiny, soft, smooth feel. I'm the person who reaches out to pet fabric when walking through a clothing store to see what it feels like and I adore the feel of it.",

This screen protector is very easy to install provided you take your time and line it up right. Once it landed on the screen it seemed to just hover until i gently poked the very center and then whoop! it attached. There were a couple of bubbles near the edge but they both pushed out using my finger. Anyway, pretty straight-forward, fits perfectly and it's exactly what I was looking for.",

                "reviewText": "So I read the reviews and I thought maybe I would give the chance. Run away from these, they are not worth the materiel they are made of. First the screen protector does not stick to the screen like it should, it comes off to easily and there is small gap that if you fingernail hits it, it will come off. Dropped the phone and the screen protector just popped off, while my screen of my S23 was protected , that's where it started to go downhill more. The protector cracked so I added the second one. It's more secure but the fingerprint read will not register your finger print. You almost have to press down so hard, it feels like you might crack your actual screen. The first one did work .. The second one won't even register the finger print, even one you press down, slap it. The only thing that is holding up is the camera protector for the camera.",

Yes, I followed directions. When I tried to used the fingerprint spot, I see that there's a smug in that spot. Now my phone won't read my fingerprint. I replaced the screen protector with the other one that came in the package. It did the exact same thing. I'm not happy with this. The reason I gave it three stars is because the one I bought the first time worked fine.",
