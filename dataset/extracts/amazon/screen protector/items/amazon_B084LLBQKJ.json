                "reviewText": "The best thing about this product is that it has a very well-thought-out installation system. The packaging doubles as an alignment jig, and there are 4 layers that peel off in sequence to make sure there is exact alignment with zero dust. I was very impressed, because other protectors I've used in the past didn't provide much help getting the thing properly aligned, and it always seemed no matter how careful there would be that one tiny little dust bubble.This one installed perfectly the first time. It doesn't interfere with the finger sensor, and feels smooth to the touch.My only slight negative I've noticed is that I can feel the edge, which I use as the \"back\" swipe gesture (swiping in from the edge) I didn't experience that with my old protector, so I think it's very very slightly undersized compared to my old one. It's not a big deal and doesn't interfere with touch and gestures.",

                "reviewText": "First of all I want to say this review is not final, I will update when I hear back from invisible shield which I hope is soon.After opening the package I noticed some lines in the middle of the screen protector but dismissed them when I realized that the way this is applied is top half first and bottom half second so that the hard plastic that comes off is in two pieces. I figured the lines would come off after installation, they didn't. As you can see by the pictures they are still there. I don't think this happened during shipment because it's boxed in a plastic cover from the merchant. I think this is a direct result of the way this is packaged! The other issue is also as you can see it doesn't cover the entire screen on the ultra. I've emailed invisi shield I. Hopes of either getting my money back or getting a new screen protector. At this time I can't say wether I recommend this product or not, it will depend on response from the company!*update*I said I would update when I heard from the company. They finally reached out to me and sent me a replacement. As you know this screen protector comes with a warranty, which is awesome! They sent me a replacement and all is good now, I would definitely buy this product again. This screen protector is the best I've ever used, I do recommend to watch the video of how to install, there's some on YouTube. The directions on paper can get confusing so the video will help clear the confusion.",

I'm hesitant to buy another because of this, but its honestly one of the best i tried so far in terms of fit, feel, and durability.",

                "reviewText": "The directions state to start in the center with the squeegee to start the release of the bottom protective layer. You really need to start past the center and bend the layers back far enough to allow the bottom protective layer to flip out and tart peeling forward. I also made the mistake of rubbing at a bubble with my fingernail that left some indents that I don't think are going to come out. They don't seem to affect the affect the clarity of the screen, but they don't look nice in reflected light. The bottom protective layers are adhesive to remove any dust stragglers during the installation.On the plus side the adhesion seems strong even around the edges. I didn't have to re-register my fingerprints to unlock the phone. Zagg was quick to send me a replacement when I totally boogered up the 1st one I got from Amazon, although it cost me about $8.00 shipping.Will I buy another one in the future? Probably. Will I be more careful with the installation? Definitely.",
