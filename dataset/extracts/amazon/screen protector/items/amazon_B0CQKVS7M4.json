                "reviewText": "I have used LK screen protectors before for my older cell phones but in light of getting new ones for the family I purchased these screen protectors based on the great products LK has. I was not disappointed. The kit includes 2 screen protectors, all of the cleaning and prep items and an alignment frame to help install the glass accurately. The video was intuitive but not needed if you have done this before.I was able to easily install the screen protectors on the 4 phones in less that 20 minutes. You do have to work some small bubbles out that appear as the glass is settling but in the end with the tools provided it was a breeze.With my previous experience with LK products I can confirm that the tempered glass does protect the screen from cracking from minor falls as two of the earlier family phones have had the screen protector crack but the screen was left in perfect condition. A quick replacement of the protector gets you back to a perfect screen.I give these products 5 stars. I don't have a way to confirm 9H hardness but can attest to the fact that the screen protectors are scratch resistant (think keys and phone in a pocket or purse), oleophobic, and do a great job in protecting the cell phone screens. They stay in place until you want to remove them. Make sure that you clean the screen very well prior to installing as any oils on the screen do cause issues with the protector releasing.",

                "reviewText": "This was the smoothest protector installation I've ever done. The kit comes with an plastic frame that snaps to your phone and takes all the hassle out of lining up the cutout for the selfie camera.I had some minor issues with bubbling under the protector, but the kit came with a tool and instructions that got those out without too much work.The smaller protector for the camera lenses doesn't come with an alignment frame,, but the circular indentations and flash cutout in the glass made lining things up pretty easy.This is a good kit, and the protectors work well with the Otterbox Commuter case for this phone - if I ever need a new protector kit for this phone or another one, I'm definitely going to be looking at this brand.",

The holder to put on the front glass screen protector makes it infinitely easier to install, however do note that if it isnt absolutely 100% perfect, you will have some slight overlap on the front camera.Do note that n100 screen protectors fit on the n200 as well. You can verify that on the web.My only complaint is that I'd like more of an oleophobic coating, but how much do you want for 10 dollars.",

Since the cracks only barely affect the function of the phone, I\u2019ll leave it there for now. I did purchase a 3 pack, so I\u2019m all set for now. My rating as an Amazon purchaser will define my comment\u2019s validation.",
