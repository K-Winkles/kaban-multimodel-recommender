                "reviewText": "Over the years of phones recognizing the face or fingerprint, I've never been able to connect. I've bought Supersheild glass screen protector in the past, but not in recent years. I've typically gone with a very overpriced product which warrants their glass for lifetime. Great marketing, but the process of getting a replacement is burdening. I put off contacting them because of all the things one goes through to get a broken glass replaced for the costly price that's paid. I felt some amount of fear about dropping a new phone. The returning process just wasn't worth it. I've made my last purchase from them. Ever. Upside, I did receive a plastic guide from that purchase that lays over my phone which helped to apply the Supersheild screen protector. It's clear, went right into place, and had very few bubbles. By the next day the glass had relaxed enough that great adhesion made the view beautiful. I just cannot say enough about the quality. I know this sounds light years behind everyone, but for my phone to recognize my face or be able to discern my fingerprint is awesome. No my phone did not do an update. This is not the only phone that could not detect either. I've had both iOS and Android. I've experienced two different android phone makers that would never work. I was amazed that after applying the SS protector, my phone recognized my face! Not believing it was real, it worked with my fingerprint too. I did have to go through the fingerprint settings again which is instructed by Supersheild. Regarding how long this will last, no one knows. I only know that the other brand may have been thicker, but it broke fairly quickly. I do use good impact resistant phone covers, so know how much I tried not to go through the company for a return. \ud83d\ude44 don't ask why I kept buying them. BTW, these broken screen protectors are glass and will put tiny cuts on your fingers. Cost high or low. I really wished I had purchased these screen protectors months and months ago. Plus you get 3 screen protectors! I hope this helps you make a solid decision and satisfied purchase. I did and I won't ever be zig-zag'd about my tempered glass purchases again. The Supersheild company is great!",

                "reviewText": "Doing quick research into all Pixel 7 screen covers, show that they all can have issues with the fingerprint reader. Seems more like an issue with other hardware. My old Pixel 2 I upgraded from had the sensor on the back and no issues.Anyways, I did the same as everyone else and turned on the 'Screen Protector' setting and re-scanned my thumb. It works fairly well all things considered. I would say it doesn't take like 10% of the time at the very most. When it rejects, it can be frustrating, but again, it seems like any screen protector will cause these issues. This one went on really easy. No bubbles.",

Some people recommended deleting the current fingerprints and re-doing them with this screen protector. I did just that. It worked for like half a day and then stopped working. It's frustrating because I use that feature the most. My previous protector, recommended by google, worked great. I think I will have to re-purchase the one from google because I really want this sensor to work.",

There's a significant gap between the edge of phone and the protector. I'm sure it will do its job, but with a case it just looks goofy. Had to redo my fingerprints to make the reader work. Make sure there's so dust at the fingerprint reader or else it will not work at all.Edit: fingerprint sensor is hit or miss. A damp finger is the only consistent way to unlock it. Kinda frustrating.",

This is the ONLY one that works perfectly and have real adhesion on the sides!Sure if it came with a guide, that'll really help, but one of the other bad profit came with one that works with this product (lucky me) so installation was easy for me. The guides sticker that are included will work if you have patience tho.",

Installation was relatively easy, although videos on YouTube seemed more helpful than the instructions included. I originally gave this 3 stars, since the fingerprint reader had a hard time reading through the screen protector. After many failed attempts to reset my fingerprint, I found that I was pressing a bit to hard during setup. It's still a bit fussy while trying to read through the protector, but works in two trys most of the time.",

                "reviewText": "Not the first time I've gone with Supershieldz. Fits the Pixel 8 Pro perfectly, and just barely fits in the rim of my Spigen case. Was a definite pain to install though, and ended up having to toss the first screen protector due to bubbles from dust after a botched install.Unfortunately, Supershieldz seems to have dropped the quality over the years. The 3-pack from my last phone was purchased in 2018 for my then-new OnePlus, and the install was much smoother back then. I'd know, since I reapplied the leftover screen protector to the old phone right before doing it on the new Pixel.It mostly comes down to the install hardware they now include. The plastic film on the old protector had some resistance to it, which made sliding it around for alignment before sticking it down a breeze. The newer ones come with a very smooth film backing, which is smooth enough that even the camera bump on the Pixel 8 Pro causes it to slide off if you lift your fingers for a second. So, aligning the newer screen protector was a PAIN. And then, the newer backing generates so much static when peeled off that dust clings to it as soon as it's free. The old one wasn't nearly as bad.On top of that, the soft drying cloth they include in the newer kits is not only much smaller, it sheds significantly more material than the old one all over your freshly cleaned screen. Had to throw the first Pixel screen protector out since it was covered in dust by the time I was done with the \"dust remover\" pad on the screen. Bubbles galore, all caused by the cheaper install tools.After losing one of three screen protectors to dust generated by the install kit, and the fact these things used to boast a Lifetime Replacement Warranty that's no longer offered or even mentioned, it leaves me wondering if I'd have been better off buying the cheaper kits.",
