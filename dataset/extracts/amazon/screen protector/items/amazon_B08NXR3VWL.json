                "reviewText": "I absolutely love these tempered glass screen protectors for my Motorola One Ace 5G UW phone!I just recently purchased a new phone that I absolutely love! The only downside of my purchase was that it's a prepaid phone (the service provider is Verizon Wireless, which I've been a prepaid Verizon customer for about 8 years now and love their service and price of my plan), but with it being a prepaid phone I had to purchase it from Walmart. Which wasn't really a problem making my phone purchase from Walmart as I've previously purchased my past 3 or 4 prepaid phones from Walmart as well.The only real issue with purchasing a prepaid phone from Walmart (regardless of which prepaid service provider you choose) is that they usually do not offer any type of phone cases or tempered glass screen protectors for the limited options that are available for the models and brands they have available and in stock to choose from.Fortunately, I found an amazing brand and model Motorola phone that I absolutely love!Unfortunately, Walmart did not have any available options in the store for cases or tempered glass screen protectors for the exact model of Motorola phone I purchased.So, I immediately started looking for phone cases and tempered glass screen protectors for my exact model of Motorola phone and was very quickly able to find both an amazing phone case and wonderful tempered glass screen protectors for my new phone!These tempered glass screen protectors are absolutely great quality! I was extremely satisfied with the durability, high quality features, and the very easy application process!I also really love that this product comes with 2 separate tempered glass screen protectors for my phone. So, in case I ever need to replace this one, I already have a spare!Thank you so much for the extremely fast shipping and delivery of my order too! I would definitely recommend this seller and product to everyone interested or looking for a quality tempered glass screen protector at a very affordable and reasonable price!",

                "reviewText": "I installed this shield on our new phones two weeks ago. Two days ago my phone fell and landed face down on the kitchen floor, which resulted in two major chips on the edges of the screen, and cracks which quickly spread over the screen (there are more cracks and chips which don't show in the photo.) I ordered another set of the shields, and today as I took off the damaged shield, I was relieved to see that the shield worked and the original phone screen was fine. My husband installed the first set on our two phones, but he had shoulder surgery last week so he wasn't able to install the new one. I followed the instructions (video is great), but one additional thing helped with the alignment of the super slick surfaces. After the prep work, I placed the shield on the phone (which had the side of the phone with the tabs on the edge of the table) and then I used both hands to hold all four corners of the shield in place while my husband used one hand to wrap the tabs from the shield to the back of the phone. He said it was much easier than when he had done it by himself two weeks ago. I love that this shield protected my phone screen, and I also like that it greatly reduces fingerprints and smears on the screen.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a Motorola One 5G Ace: Researched for accessories.[ 2+3 Pack ] UniqueMe Compatible with Motorola One 5G Ace Tempered Glass + Camera Lens ProtCon: I found and watched endless videos for other cell screen instructions.Just could not find:--Motorola One 5G Ace, and gave up.I wasted a lot of time trying to place the first screen protector on. Bubbles :(The Unique's screen leaves a gap between it and my case. I don't like that at all.Pro: Happily, I was able to place the 2nd screen protector on.The camera lens easily placed on.Easy install after I stopped wasting my time with the first one.Thankfully, I'm not that rough on my cell phones, so I won't need to replace this one. Knock on Wood. :)My last cell was a Moto 4g Plus, and all accessories lasted over three or four years. So I'm surprised by (Unique's) Moto One 5g Ace screen protectors coverage. The coverage of the screen doesn't go to the very edge like my Moto 4g plus' screen protector. And with my my case on I can really see the gap.",
