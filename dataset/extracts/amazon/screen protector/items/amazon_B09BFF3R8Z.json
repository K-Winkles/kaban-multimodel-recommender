A1: Yes, After our test, It works 100% with Otterbox case. Also, the size of this screen protector and lens protector is designed with edge gaps, so it can easily fit all cases. Q2: Will it affect the quality of my photos? Especially at night. A2: Ferilinso\u2018s screen protector is made of 99.99% high permeability material, adding electrostatic adsorption, so it keeps the original image quality of iPhone 13 Pro day or night, giving you a super clear viewing and photo experience. Q3: What is the difference between your cell phone film and lens protector and normal protective film? How do they protect my phone screen? A3: Ferilinso's 9h hardness ultra-thin tempered glass protector and lens protector are both treated with high-temperature carbon steel for enhanced impact resistance and have a diamond anti-scratch protection layer from accidental wear and scratches from knives, keys and other hard objects. It also uses a nano coating to protect against fingerprints, oil and filter UV rays.They provide all-around protection while maintaining an HD viewing experience. Q4: How do I remove air bubbles? A4: Generally, if you follow the installation instructions correctly, no air bubbles will appear. We recommend that you clean the screen with the cleaning tool included in the package before applying the screen protector to prevent air bubbles. If air bubbles appear, it is very easy to remove them by gently squeezing with your thumb. Q5: How thick is the screen protector and will it affect the sensitivity of my touch screen? A5: Our films are ultra-thin at 0.013 inches (0.33 mm) thick, and they are reliable and flexible, High touch sensitivity provides a \"true-to-touch\" feel and ensure fast response performance.",

Doesn\u2019t darken screen when facing the phone directly, and the side view privacy is nice.Would recommend",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this screen protector back on 12/21/2021 and I'm writing this review on 3/31/2023 so it's easily been a year and a half that I have had it on my phone. It's done a great job and hadn't even really thought about it. Until last weekend.............I was rushing around trying to get my Corvette cleaned up to go to a car show. I laid my phone down on a ledge in the back hatch while it was open with the screen of the phone facing up. In my rush I finished with the cleaning supplies and put them back in the basket I have in the back hatch. I then proceeded to grab the truck/hatch lid and push/pull/slam it down and it didn't latch. As soon as I heard that it didn't latch immediately I knew what I had done. Sure enough I looked and my phone was laying there face up and the latch on the trunk had smashed the screen right in the center of the phone and it was shattered from there all the way out to all the edges. I honestly wouldn't even expect a screen protector to keep the screen from breaking with that type of impact. So it was a Saturday morning and I just figured I'd have to try and take it in somewhere on the coming Monday to get it fixed. Then my son had stopped by and I showed it to him. He replied that he thought all it was, was the screen protector was broken. I told him there was no way the actual screen wasn't broken!!!! I got out my knife and peeled a corner away and sure enough the actual screen had not a single scratch on it!!!!! So this protector has been on the screen for a year and a half and it did it's job perfectly when it was time for it to actually perform!!!!!! 1000% recommend this Screen Protector!!!!!!As far as the Camera Screen Protectors I have not had as much luck. I carry my phone in my front pocket with the Camera Screen facing outward. I have had probably 5 or 6 of the camera protectors break but the actual camera lense's have not been damaged thankfully. I'm not sure how but I continue to crack the Camera Screen Protector but they are cheap enough so I had just purchased more and when they break I just change them out.",

                "reviewText": "It's always so exciting to get a new phone, but the headache comes when you realize you need a case and a screen protector and a camera lens protector and it's all just kinda overwhelming. Not only because options are usually somewhat slim, but also because there aren't ever that many reviews yet! So how are we supposed to know if it's a good product? Well, I guess we just have to cross our fingers and hope for the best. Which is what I did with this purchase. At the time of my order, there were 12 reviews, all 5 stars and they seemed really legitimate. This seemed like a better option than going with another brand that just keeps the same reviews from last year's item and changes the title to this year's model. With that said, I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Actually, I could, but it's something super minor and I'll get into that later. For now, I want to mention all of the great things I've noticed about these screen and lens protectors. First, I love how even though the top looks like it's cut out for the camera, it's actually not on the finished product. It's a smooth covering that's fully protected. It's just that those areas don't have the 'privacy' glass like the rest of it does. It's a nice fit for the iPhone 14, although I do think it is just a hair too small. With a case, it doesn't bother me though, as the gap between the case and the edge of the protector is minimal and I can't really feel it unless I'm trying to. The lens protector was a huge surprise to me. I didn't think I'd really care if it were there or not, but now I'm absolutely thrilled to have it! I always had such a hard time keeping my lenses clean and free of nicks and dents around them, but now I don't have to worry about that at all. It's a flat surface all the way across, so a quick wipe with whatever cloth is nearby means my photos will be clear. It also feels really nice to the touch versus having to deal with those clunky ugly lenses. It's definitely something I didn't know I needed in my life and I'm so glad it was included in this kit! I suppose it would be nice if there were color options for the black rings, but that's a petty ask and it doesn't really matter. The fact that the kit comes with 3 of everything is such a huge bonus. The glass feels durable and not too bendy. I'm also noticing way less fingerprints and smudges on my screen than usual! It's smooth and feels really natural to use.The one and only real thing I would change is the overall 'privacy' aspect of it. While I don't really have anything to hide, I always hate that feeling of someone seeing what I'm up to on my own phone. This protector does what it needs to, but I could use a tad more privacy. Even at a 45 degree angle, it's still possible to see what's on the screen, it just makes it a little blurry. At an almost 90 degree angle, it's fully blurry, but you can still make out shapes and colors. The only true way to hide your screen from curious eyes is to turn the brightness down as low as you can handle it.The last thing I want to mention is the customer service. Upon purchasing, I received a message from the seller to make sure I ordered the right item for the iPhone I have. I had, so there was no issue, but they also included some useful tips on how to install the protectors and offered assistance should I need it. In my entire existence as an Amazon customer, I have never received any message like that from any other seller. It really made me feel like they care about their product and their users. It was such a lovely touch and I wish more companies/sellers would do the same.",
