                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector [GlasTR EZ FIT] for my iPhone 15 Pro Max, and I must say it's been a great investment. This two-pack provides excellent value for money, ensuring I have a spare one in case of accidental damage.First and foremost, the installation process was a breeze. The GlasTR EZ FIT design makes it easy to align and apply the protector accurately, without any frustrating air bubbles or misalignment. It fits perfectly on the screen of the iPhone 15 Pro Max, leaving no gaps or edges exposed.In terms of protection, this tempered glass screen protector does an exceptional job. It effectively guards against scratches, smudges, and accidental drops, giving me peace of mind knowing that my device's screen is well-protected. The high-quality materials used by Spigen contribute to its durability, and it feels smooth and responsive to touch, just like the bare screen.Another feature worth mentioning is its \"case-friendly\" design. It is compatible with most iPhone 15 Pro Max cases, ensuring that the protector does not lift or interfere with the case's edges. This compatibility is convenient for those who want to use additional protection without compromising on the screen coverage.Additionally, the screen protector maintains the clarity of the iPhone 15 Pro Max's display. It offers high transparency, allowing vibrant colors and sharp details to come through without distortion or loss in image quality. The oleophobic coating also minimizes fingerprints, making it easy to keep the screen looking clean.Although the protector is robust, it is essential to note that it may develop some minor scratches over time, especially with frequent wear and tear. However, this is a common occurrence with tempered glass protectors in general.Overall, I highly recommend the Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector [GlasTR EZ FIT] for iPhone 15 Pro Max. It delivers on its promises of easy installation, reliable protection, case compatibility, and maintaining screen clarity. With the added bonus of a two-pack, it is an excellent investment to keep your iPhone 15 Pro Max's screen in pristine condition.",

It's really cheap compared to the competition and the glass feels better than everything I've tried. The coating is oleophobic so fingerprints are barely visible and the glass makes my screen experience virtually the same as if I did not have any screen protector. I've used older spigen ones and I always stick with spigen, easy to use and protective. My screen has never cracked and i havent changed a spigen screen protector unless im getting a new phone.",

                "reviewText": "A very nice screen protector! The package includes two screens, two frames to insure accurate placement, and two set of supplies to ensure your screen is clean and dust free. I installed the screen protector before my Spivey case was delivered. The installation went easy, looked, great, and worked well. While pushing out the air bubbles I noticed that I had put it on slightly (very slightly!) to one side. After a few days my case arrived. The case fits very snugly. While pressing my phone into the case, the edge of the case lifted one side of the screen protector introducing a huge bubble that could not be pressed out. If you\u2019ve ever had this issue, you know that the touch screen capacity doesn\u2019t work under the bubble. Thankfully the kit includes two screens and supplies. I removed the first one and repeated the process with the second protector being very careful with placing the frame properly. I could see my second try resulted in the protector being well centered. When I put it in my new case I was very careful to not catch the edge. It looks and works great! I\u2019m grateful two screen protectors came with the kit. Refills are also available and you can use the same frame which saves some money next time around.Overall I\u2019m very pleased and impressed with the screen protector and case and recommend it to anyone looking for protection of their iPhone 15 Pro Max.",

                "reviewText": "I've purchased Spigen products before and always found them to be high-quality. However, I just installed this screen protector on a 6-week old iPhone on which I had installed a screen protector the instant it came out of the box. I dropped the phone & cracked that screen protector so it was time for a new one. I turned the phone off so the black screen would make it easier to see specks of dust then removed the cracked one, cleaned and dried the screen and carefully inspected it. No apparent dust, so I installed this new Spigen protector, a very simple & straightforward process. There was one very small and stubborn bubble near the middle of the screen which resisted all attempts to squeegee it away. Careful examination seemed to indicate a tiny speck in the middle, which I realized meant the bubble wasn't going away. I removed that protector, assuming the speck of dust would be adhered to it, and replaced it with the second one from the box. Same problem! It's hard to believe a speck of dust could be so stubborn - maybe there's a flaw in the surface of my iPhone? Also hard to believe. At any rate, there's a small bubble I'll have to live with. I'm not going to order another screen protector just to fix that. The lesson is: be super-careful when cleaning your phone before installing!",

                "reviewText": "The EZ fit tray makes installation super easy as it lines it up for you. Managed to install it first try in about 5 minutes and it looks amazing! Protector clarity is very good and has no issues with touch sensitivity. Almost edge to edge protection, and when paired with a Spigen case, there's almost no gaps which is nice.The squeegee was useful as there were a few small bubbles towards the middle but using the corner to press them down repeatedly for a few minutes managed to remove them fully.The microfibre cloth that was included was a bit dusty or had some threads coming off, because when I used it, I noticed it left some dust behind on the screen, and I ended up having to re-wipe it down and instead use a can of compressed air to dry it. Was also useful along with the dust stickers in removing the smaller pieces after cleaning it, but I installed it right after opening the phone so there wasn't much to begin with.The oleophobic coating doesn't seem to be as strong as I hoped since fingerprints are starting to show up after a week of use.Overall, for a two-pack which means if you mess up the first time, or it cracks after dropping, this is a great deal for how easy and simple it is to install! Definitely worth it.",

                "reviewText": "Ordered this for my new iPhone 15 Pro Max. Easy first time installation and waited for the recommended 30 seconds aaaand\u2026 no bubbles! Fits perfectly! Only minor gripe is the protector itself doesn\u2019t cover all the way up to the edges of the screen, so dirt and dust might have a tendency to collect and build up around the edges of it. Away from that, still fits perfectly and goes well with my Spigen tough military grade armour case.PS: I see there are two variations of these screen protectors - one covers the entire screen while the other has a cut out for the pill box camera notch, which makes no sense as the bill box itself expands across the top of the screen for messages notifications, etc. I went with the full cover screen protector.",
