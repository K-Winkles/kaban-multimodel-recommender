My issue is that I just went to replace the very first I had put on it and discovered that one of the other 2 is cracked in the corner and a bit across the top(shown in photo) and has always been it\u2019s protective case it comes in (shown in photo).....that disappoints me.

I drop my phone pretty often and thought for sure when I went to get a new one there would be cracks in my screen, bc after several and I do mean several drops there was some cracking in the corner, but when I took the protector off it was not damaged at all! So I bought a new one for my new phone too! This is super easy to install and worth every penny and more! Can\u2019t say enough how great this product is!",

                "reviewText": "A good affordable option and the privacy tint/angle doesn\u2019t appear to impact the face recognition software in iOS. Installation was the same as any screen protector, but having the cutout for the top phone speaker and black outline made it fairly straightforward. Adhesion seems fine and the usual bubble from applying was rubbed to the outer edges without much effort. We\u2019ll see how chip resistant the glass is in the long term, but having a 2nd backup only improves the value of the purchase.",
