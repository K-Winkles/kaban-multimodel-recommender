                "reviewText": "I've been buying this exact line of screen (Tech Armor HD Clear Plastic Film) for 3 generations of iPhones in my family now.When my wife and I bought new XRs, there was no doubt in my mind I'd go with them again.Let me start with the drawbacks.1 - You have to be extremely clean to not end up with dust trapped underneath. When I'm installing, I ask the kids to stay away to stop airborne dust movement. I choose a clean table to work at. I have a strong source of light, so that when I look at the reflection of the light on the screen, I can see any dust particles. Wipe those off with microfiber or use the sticker (both included).2 - You have to have a very steady hand and a sharp eye. This was always true of these, but with the XR it's 10x as important. Why? Because the XR screen is curved near the edges. There is obviously no way to make a film that would follow and stick to that curve, so Tech Armor made the film only as large as the flat portion of the screen. It does not truly go edge to edge! In my opinion that is not a big deal, you have 98% of your screen protected. But it does make lining up the film much tougher since you can't use an edge as a guideline as was possible with older iPhones.The way I handled it was this. After peeling the film backing (labeled #1), I held the film by placing my two thumbs along one long edge and my two pointer fingers along the other long edge. Pinching the film slightly, so that it would bow outwards (towards the phone). If you're right handed, I would place the phone in front of you with the notch end (top of iphone) facing right, and the bottom facing left (in landscape orientation). Now, start at the top end of the phone by the screen notch. That notch will help you center the film. Slowly bring the film down towards the screen while you keep it slightly pinched. The center of the film should make contact first, and have it centered around the notch, such that the end of the film meets the end of the flat portion of the glass (not the curved part).Now, before you lower it further, check the bottom edge just to see that it appears to be hovering centered. Slowly start bringing the center of the film down the middle of the phone's screen until you reach the bottom. At this point, only a thin section of film should be touching the screen, from top to bottom, down the very middle. Eyeball the placement, checking that it's centered, from a top-down view. If you're not happy, lift it and start over, this is the only chance you'll get really. If happy, then lower it into place. Use the included squeegee wrapped in the microfiber to push the bubbles out.If you find one or two specks of dust, I do not recommend that you try to lift the film to remove them, as long as they're small specks. There is more risk in damaging the film than reward in getting those dust particles out. I have also found that the dust specks appear large at first, but eventually the film wraps around them and the tiny air bubble diminishes in size. I had two dust specks when I first installed mine, and with patience and gently rubbing the film, I was able to have them completely disappear and don't even know where they are anymore.After you peel off protective film #2, it's still OK to rub the film to work out any remaining bubbles, just be sure you use something gentle like the microfiber that is included, and work slowly.If you've read this far, you're probably wondering why anyone would go through the trouble of a difficult install to use this film?First, it adds essentially 0 thickness to the phone. I truly forget it's there. Even the thinnest glass protectors are noticeable to my eyes and ruin the sleek look of the phone. This one disappears.Second, there's no risk of shattering the film. My wife isn't particularly careful with her phone, tosses it in her purse, etc. The film has never peeled off and never ripped. It has protected against keys and coins.Third, it has good \"feel\" to it. Touch action is perfect, there is just a little bit of friction as you glide, and smudges wipe off easily.Finally, you get a pack of 3 for the price. If you still have the phone 2 years later and there's scratches in the film or haze, you have a new one waiting for you. I find it economical.",

I am not saying that these will keep your phone screen from getting a crack, but I am saying that when you do get a crack, these will keep your phone screen intact and your fingers safe from getting glass in them. I drop my phone a lot. I do have several cracks in my screen as we speak, but they are not affecting anything and they are staying sealed because of the film screen protector. No screen protector will keep your screen from cracking but this one will keep your screen from murdering your fingers.",

You can see the scratches that it has saved my phone from. I think the little bubble looking spots might be from water that has possibly collected over the last 2 weeks when I was at the river a couple of times. I kind of dropped it in a damp spot, not directly in the water, but close!As with any film cover, it\u2019s a bit tricky to install without getting any bubbles or dust at all, but the company does its best to help you by including a soft micro-fiber cleaning cloth, dust removal tape, & a bubble removing squeegee that\u2019s small enough to use with a phone sized screen. I\u2019d suggest using a table or desk for stability & having nice bright light so that you can see any dust particles or fingerprints before you put the film on. I love that this has a little tab labeled 1 & 2 so you know which protective film to remove first & that also makes it easy to remove during installation.I love these so much more than the tempered glass protectors. The glass ones shatter when dropped. These never look bad, even with scratches you can still see your screen just fine!",

                "reviewText": "I got this PAT film screen protector after cracking more than a half dozen of the \u201ctempered glass\u201d protectors. Hopefully these ones last longer.The Tech Armor install instructions basically have you eyeball the alignment and \u2018use your fingertips to guide the screen protector into place for a \u201cprecision fit\u201d \u2018. Unless you have some super steady hands, I don\u2019t know how most regular people would be able to do this. So instead, I used three stickers to test fit my alignment. Two stickers acted as a hinge, and the third sticker was used to open and close the hinge without having to touch the adhesive side with my fingers.After fitting alignment, I used the cloth and sticker to remove as much remaining dust and dirt from the screen as possible, then I took off #1 film and stuck the pre-aligned protector on the screen.To prevent from scratching the film, I used the squeegee to remove bubbles while the #2 film was still attached. Then I removed the guide stickers and #2 film to complete the installation. I used the #2 film + squeegee to remove any remaining major air bubbles.There were a few small bubbles left, but I don\u2019t live in a dust-free room, so nothing unreasonable. After turning on the screen, the minor bubbles left were unnoticeable, so overall a great product so far. Plus they include four screen protectors, so it\u2019s a good value for the price too, so I hope they last longer than the glass protectors. I\u2019ll update if anything changes.",
