I've used these tempered glass protectors since day one, and so far there are no cracks or scratches on the screen. A few weeks ago the phone, flew off the stack of Amazon boxes I was carrying up the sidewalk. It landed face down, and the screen was cracked. Well, the screen PROTECTOR was cracked. After peeling the protector off there was not a single scratch in the phone's screen.Until my next phone purchase, these screen protectors are staying in place.",

                "reviewText": "Every time I get a new phone, I always buy screen protectors that come in a pack of multiples because I almost always screw one or two up. This protector pack comes with a guide that you snap around the front edges of the phone that make it impossible to put the screen protector on crooked. It was absolutely the easiest installation I've ever done. I always buy Supershieldz brand because they protect so well, but whoever came up with the snap-on guide needs a raise. I'm super happy with this purchase.Edit: I've used both screen shields in my pack. The first one developed a long bubble along the edge so I took it off, cleaned the screen and installed the second screen protector. Over time, the new protector has developed a bubble in the same place. It starts out small and gets bigger. I thought maybe it was from using the volume keys, but I started using the on-screen volume control as much as possible and it still happens. Also I use the power button as much, if not more, as the volume and I don't have a bubble on that side, so I'm at a loss for a cause. The bubbles did not appear until a month or two after installation for both shields. They started out small and got bigger over time. I still like the protectors, I just wish this didn't happen.",

One day while getting out of the car, I forgot my phone was in my lap and got out and heard the dreaded sound of my phone falling on the pavement. Panicked, I picked it up and noticed the screen was cracked. Cried all the way home because I did NOt want to purchase another phone. Got home and decided to remove the screen protector and see how bad the damage was and I gasped! The phone screen was not damaged- just the protector! Yay!!!",
