I also really love that they include a dust sticker that is the size of the whole display which can be used in one go to remove all dust, so you are not chasing specks around the display. (Though the adhesive is surprisingly strong for a \"dust removal\" tool!)The glass itself has pretty good feel - nice friction/coating, almost like factory glass. No issues with touch sensitivity, etc.This is honestly what all screen protector kits should aspire to be.",

If you have a case on the phone you need to take it off first. The install was easy and there are not any trapped air bubbles which usually happens when I try to put on screen protectors without a frame for lining up. This was a good purchase.",

When it was all manual, without these helper tools, there was always a chance to have some bubbles due to dust comes in while you are trying to manually adjust the protector.Then i used some different tools. It all felt like a \"great leap towards convenience\". Though chances to make it wrong was still there! Screen might move, after stickers dust might come again, side sticking is not strong and sides go up...I used the tool with the product. It was unreal! After putting the phone into the tool, I felt like \"its weird, cant be that easy, probably it didnt stick, there will be bubbles everywhere \". Then I took the phone out! It was perfect, surprisingly perfect!I recommend to everyone. Easy assembly, full screen dust sticker is a much better touch than small ones, screen has a very clean view and it is shiny (not so much like gloss protectors, just a bit, right amount:).",
