                "reviewText": "Installation was relatively easy, but whether you use the included installation guide frame or not, there's still about 1mm of excess glass on the bottom, and about 0.5mm on either side. The excess is visible by areas that are not adhering to the original screen. The edges of the protector are also not beveled, which creates a noticeable tactile contrast when you're dragging from the top/sides to open a menu on the phone. After 2 weeks, the screen is holding up well despite the overhang on the sides/bottom. The camera protector screen fit perfectly over the respective area, and is a nice addition to the kit. Thickness of the main screen protector has not affected the touchscreen sensitivity or response on the phone keyboard.",

                "reviewText": "This screen protector is very easy to install with the provided guide. It goes on perfectly centered and bubble-free. Incredibly clear and bright screen protector. Yes it is a tiny bit smaller than the entire screen but this is necessary due to the slight curve on the screen edges, and to also make sure that a phone case won't be pushing on the edges and cause it to lift. It resists finger stains fairly well. Keep in mind that is no screen that will completely prevent finger stains. This one is very easy to clean with just a dry microfiber cloth. The camera protector also fits well, and the hole for the flash prevents any sort of flash echo. Fingerprint reader on the screen also works quite well. Ensure that you adjust your setting in the phone and turn on the enhanced features designed for screen protectors. Also press slightly harder on the screen to ensure a good fingerprint read. All in all an excellent product.",

I love that it came with a protector for the camera area in the back of the phone (it never crossed my mind, but agree that it should be protected). It took mere minutes, and the wet/dry wipes were sufficient, and the stiff board included in the package was helpful in easing out the two tiny bubbles that were left after pressing on the middle of the glass. Excellent value for the price!",
