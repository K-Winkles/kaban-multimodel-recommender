The plastic flexibility is the exact reason why we call it tempered glass screen protector. Tempered glass is a type of safety glass that is stronger than ordinary glass. 2. It cannot be seen from the appearance that it is glass or plastic. As a customer, what can we do to identify it? There is an easy, quick, cost-effective way to test it yourself, and it's very accurate. Most plastics have a melting point between 160 and 210 degrees Celsius, and glass materials are at least over 1400 degrees Celsius, so is there a lighter around. 3. Does it come with a cleaning wipe to use prior to placing on the phone? Yes, the package includes: 4*Guide Stickers, 2*Wet Wipe & 2*Dry Wipe, 2*Dust Absorber. 4. Why the Screen Protector is so dark, I was unable to see my screen? This Screen Protector is privacy screen protector, due to this privacy cover will darken the screen to prevent the peeking eyes near you, you might need to turn your device display brightness up a bit when use it. 4.How can I remove bubbles? Use the kit in the package to clean the screen before placing the screen protector. If there are bubbles,try to gently press the bubbles with your finger or with a ruler,but the screen surface needs a thin cloth pad to avoid scratching the protector.",

                "reviewText": "This tinted privacy screen does a SUPER job! Like others say, it\u2019s not 100% foolproof, but for the price it is worth it! If you\u2019re needing more privacy, maybe consider what you\u2019re viewing on your phone! You do need to hold your phone at an angle toward you, and away from the person you\u2019re trying to keep from peeking at your phone screen. You will be pleased with the amount of privacy this provides, but still makes screen visible and readable for the user.Phone Used: For reference I got this for an iPhone 13 Pro.Installation:It installed easily with no bubbles after a couple of easy adjustments. It was easy to line up and stick on, even for a guy over 50! Plus it didn\u2019t prematurely try to attach itself or cling to the phone like some screen protectors do.Privacy and Darkness:It is somewhat DARK, but I just turned my screen brightness up a little and it\u2019s fine.(My eyes aren\u2019t the best, but I can still see the screen clearly.) The protector is very clear, shiny, and seems sturdy and well made.Value, Price and Longevity:This was a reasonable price for two screen protectors. Most decent screen protectors usually last 6 to 8 months before starting to separate from the edges. I will update this review if this protector doesn\u2019t last at least 8 months. At less than .30 cents a month per protector, it\u2019s a good value and well worth it. (That\u2019s if you pay $7 for two protectors.) I do like the privacy because I think people can be nosy, including your friends and relatives, even if they didn\u2019t start out being nosy on purpose. These probably aren\u2019t the cheapest but they are a good value and the \u201cselfie\u201d camera is NOT blocked like it is on some of these privacy protectors. (Read other reviews for other brands if you wish and you\u2019ll see that not all privacy screen protectors are equal) The size works great if you use any type of case. It\u2019s not too small like one review stated. The two pack saves you from having to hope they still have this brand to reorder in a year or so, and provides you with a backup if you\u2019re someone who is accident prone! Plus it may save you money, since prices will go up at some point!Save your time reading more reviews and just purchase these and move on with your life!",

                "reviewText": "I recently upgraded to an iPhone 15 Plus and was on the lookout for a reliable privacy screen protector. The Ailun Privacy Screen Protector caught my eye, and after using it, I'm convinced it deserves a glowing 5-star review.The pack comes with three screen protectors, which is incredible value for the price. Upon application, the first thing I noticed was how user-friendly the installation process was. The instructions were straightforward, and the application kit included ensured a bubble-free and accurate alignment, which can often be a frustrating aspect of applying screen protectors.What sets this screen protector apart is the privacy feature. It works exactly as advertised. When viewed from the side, the screen blacks out, providing a shield against curious onlookers. This feature has been invaluable to me in public spaces where I often handle sensitive information on my phone. It's given me the confidence to work on my device without worrying about prying eyes.In terms of durability, the Ailun Privacy Screen Protector holds up exceptionally well. The tempered glass boasts a 9H hardness rating, and it has already protected my phone from a few accidental drops and scratches that would have otherwise left marks on the phone's display. The peace of mind that comes from knowing my phone is protected is priceless.The touch sensitivity and display clarity are not compromised at all. The screen protector melds so well with the iPhone 15 Plus/iPhone 15 Pro Max's 6.7-inch display that I barely notice it's there. The touch response is as smooth and responsive as ever, which is critical for the functionality of modern smartphones.Another aspect I appreciate is the design that takes into account the front camera and sensors. There's no interference with face recognition or selfie quality, which shows the thoughtfulness put into the product's design.Lastly, the aesthetic appeal of the screen protector cannot be understated. It's virtually invisible and does not detract from the sleek design of the iPhone. It fits perfectly, and the blacked-out edges give the phone an even more seamless look.All in all, the Ailun Privacy Screen Protector has delivered on all fronts - privacy, protection, ease of use, and aesthetics. I highly recommend it to any iPhone 15 Plus or iPhone 15 Pro Max user looking for that extra layer of security and screen protection without compromising on the look and feel of their device.",

                "reviewText": "I recently got the iPhone 15 pro and got this product in the mail yesterday. I liked how they gave a QR code with a video on how to properly install it. It may have just been me, but there's the tiniest sliver of the side that isn't covered, but basically the whole screen is protected! It seamlessly blends in with the screen! I had zero air bubbles at all too, so we will see with time how it holds up. The only gripe I have is that it is only privacy from left/right and not top/bottom, but that's alright.",
