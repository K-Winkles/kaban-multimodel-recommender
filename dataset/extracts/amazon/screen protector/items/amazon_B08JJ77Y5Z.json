I did get annoyed when I saw high prices & then I saw that there were more moderately affordable protectors that were available.If you do not have a glass screen protector on your device, then your teachers did a terrible job in school. It\u2019s common cents! Buy the protection to prevemt catastrophic consequences. (I know it\u2019s \u201ccommon sense\u201d but here it really is about money, so common cents)Examples of common cents:- Condoms or kids or doctors appointments due to discharge?- Car insurance or loss of all money for rest of life?- Mobile phone screen and case protection or cost to replace mobile phone?Mobile phone replacement cost is\u2026(You must choose option 1 or option 2):1. Cost of buying a brand new mobile phone at Full Price & using the same number everyone already has, or knows, in order to contact you.- OR -2. Cost is the loss of new job because companies with your application or resume on file cannot contact you with your new phone and new number. Plus the cost to your family, friends, Doctors Offices, and Utility Companies when can no longer be contacted when there is an emergency or use you as an Emergency Contact when they are in trouble, or they are suffering from a medical or non-medical emergency, or they are severely injured and need your help. All because you think \u201cIf it breaks I will just get a new mobile phone and new number.\u201dNumber 2 IS HOW RICH PEOPLE THINK BECAUSE THEY HAVE STAFF TO CARE FOR THEM, AND THEIR FAMILIES, AND THEIR FRIENDS.YOUR PHONE NUMBER SHOULD NOT CHANGE! YOU SHOULD KEEP YOUR NUMBER FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN IN LIFE. WHEN YOUR NUMBER CHANGES YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR FRIENDS LOOSE.The mobile phone companies do not make you get a new number. Your carelessness of your mobile phone forced you to replace it. You decided to get a new number to replace what you broke due to mobile phone cost.All you had to do was buy a glass screen protector and case. Common cents!",

I don\u2019t know how good this is, just got it today. 2. There is a bubble on the top of my screen I cannot get out and I know it will drive me crazy before I get used to it\u2026",

My cases usually have the screen cover already installed. No reflection on the seller whatsoever",

The applicator is amazing. Protector does not go all the way to the end but if you have and otterbox case there wont be space left.",
