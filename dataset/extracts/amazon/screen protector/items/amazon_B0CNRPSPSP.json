Make sure to watch the installation video, since it shows how to get rid of air bubbles. Had bubbles in both installations, but very easy to get rid of them. Seller sent some updated instructions pertaining to the fingerprint reader, which worked out fine. Didn't read fingerprints quite as well as before the installation, but that's to be expected with any screen protector. Very happy with the purchase.",

I was way off, this screen protector feels like it is going to protect my phone. Finger's do not stick to the screen it glides smoothly. Does not have any issues with the in screen finger print reader at all. Will for sure need to go settings and apply the screen sensitivity that the phone comes with for screen protectors. Not only does it feel durable but it also comes with a easy to apply tool that is very helpful and bonus you get 4 total screens. I highly recommend this product, I currently have UAG case on my phone and the screen protector does not hit the case, perfect fit.",

By this I mean, that you set it in the plastic template provided and watch it adhere to the phone's screen. On our 2 new Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus phones, I had no issues with bubbles. I watched a video from the Mfg. on how to get any bubbles out if they occur but I didn't have but 1 or 2 and just lifting up the closed edge, and letting it back down, all the bubbles were removed. I would recommend!",

I tried putting the camera protector on as well but it wouldn't stay on. I'd stick it on, and it'd slowly just fall right back off. So for now I'm leaving it off since I have a phone case that helps protect the camera a little bit. Overall I'd probably not buy again, doesn't seem like the quality is on point. For the price, it's probably ok.",
