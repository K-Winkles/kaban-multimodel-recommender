Tight around the waist (I can even carry *pew pew* in them). But baggy everywhere else and in all the right places. It feels like I\u2019m wearing sweat pants but not. They aren\u2019t transparent, it\u2019s a thicker material but with the wide leg you don\u2019t get hot. They are very big, I originally ordered a large which was a mistake as I am 4ft 11in and 130lbs so I had to size way down and reorder but there was no problem returning and reordering new. These are great pants! Definitely a must have in my closet!",

                "reviewText": "The product details keep saying Linen, until you look at \"Fabric Type\", which states 70% Rayon + 30% Linen, which is also what the label says. Linen is considered a lightweight summer fabric, but this material is quite heavy. The fabric has nubs, which Linen often does, so it has a rough feel, although it is not rough against the skin. The label also says Dry Clean Only, but my experience with Rayon is that you can wash it in cold water, and then hang it up to dry, because Rayon cannot tolerate dryer heat unless your intention is to shrink it. The wrinkles didn't smooth out after hanging, which is characteristic of Linen.The sizing seems accurate and the pants are long. X-Large measurements = 4.25\" elastic waist smocking, 28.5\" inseam, 15.5\" across bottom of leg when laid flat, and 42.5\" total length of pant down the side seam.",

Pleated stitching on thighs throughout is already separating. This stitching is not stressed and is decorative yet failing. After first wash these are house pajama pants. Maximum 6 washes before trash based on the seams. They did perform well in warm climates in terms of breathability. Okay for once and trash on vacation, but not durable or sustainable. They have an opportunity with the material being breathable to have some cool vacation wear. They just need to wash the material first before sewing and use proper threads for pleating.",

I have a few items from the Anrabess store and they are all high quality, well made and fit perfectly. Material is nice, thin and flowy. I am 5'5\" and the pants do not lay properly at the bottom. The leg opening is wide, almost too wide! There is no ' slouch' at the bottom, as in the pictures . I have an hourglass figure and the pants look very BOXY and unflattering. The little pleats or 'pin tucks' on the pants, below the waist, are too low. It looks weird. I bought these to wear with flat sandals in Spring/ summer, but sadly I will be returning. I was really hoping they would work out.\ud83d\ude15",
