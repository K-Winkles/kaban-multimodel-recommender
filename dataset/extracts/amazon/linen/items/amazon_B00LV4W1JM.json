                "reviewText": "HC Collection has literally the best & softest pillow cases & sheet sets that I have ever owned!! (Esp in this type of fabric.)They stay wrinkle free, are super soft, & best of all- are LINT FREE!!!- Thank goodness!), and they just have a very clean feeing to them against your face too!Plus, these also just don\u2019t seem to hold in quite as much of the heat as some of the other sheet sets/pillow cases that are made w this same type of microfiber fabric that I have tried lately also! -Thankfully since I live in humid & sweltering Florida\u2026As I have recently been on a purchasing spree for the absolute very best sheet & pillow case sets for the very lowest price possible, I have bought many, many, different sets\u2026But THIS set is Truly the BEST SET of the ALL of them! & that\u2019s all the way across the board w all the necessary qualities you need in a sheet set & w the lowest price also too!So while the price was a bit lower than normal, I went ahead & purchased a few diff colors of this HC Collection sheets and then the matching various sized pillow cases that I needed also. So aside from one single set of sheets from Utopia, (which were awesome as well, but a bit thinner & unfortunately only came in 1 odd grey & white pattern that was just on 1 side of the sheets too), but aside for them, I can truly say that this brand here from HC Collection has made it to the very top of my absolutely favorite #1 top best set of sheets & pillow cases of all time!!!And now that I have felt how great these are, I won\u2019t be buying any others from any other brands now except from this place here and maybe from Utopia now & then..For this, nearly unreal cuz it\u2019s so low price, I just can\u2019t believe I have gotten such excellent quality products!!! Too, to have that low low price on a king sized set, that also has a bottom sheet w elastic all way around it and w it being extra deep also! Yeah that\u2019s VERY rare for that price point! PLUS, I have a 4\u201d inch topper on my Very Deep King size mattress & Still, these sheets & pillow cases fit just perfect & w/o a struggle too!!!!So I really was totally blown away by how great they were when I opened them & that\u2019s before even washing them! I truly believe any1 that try\u2019s these will love them and the quality of them. It\u2019s plain to see & feel straight out of the package. They are definitely not see through thin, nor too extremely heavy & thick either. To me, they are literally a perfect weight for sheets. Also, they are just so soft too!, {but not as hot feeling -like some other fabrics like flannel type cloth, (which also has pet hair stick to it!), but these to me feel almost like that but just way less fuzzy, so bcuz of that these actually don\u2019t have pet hair stick to it as much and they just feel more like a cotton blend would\u2026 to me anyways}\u2026They also look & feel very well made across the entire set. No stitches loose anywhere or uneven stitching either & in my opinion are well worth way more than the little bit that I paid for them! I am really surprised they are selling for so low!!!Plus my main big worry was that w this microfiber type of sheet that there would be lots of lint. I can thankfully say that there was absolutely No problem w lint like in so many other sheet sets w this type of material!!!Thank Goodness!!!!- Which for me, really was a Huge worry, esp after reading so many bad reviews from many diff brand pillow cases & sheet sets! Oh, Also no dyes were coming off any of my sheets or pillow cases either!So all in all, I can\u2019t say enough good things about this brand! If you try them you\u2019ll see exactly what I mean. Also, they have really pretty different colors for such a low price too! Not just 1 color, in only 1 specific size, at a low price - like so many other brands seem to have!So becuz of all of these things, I just finished buying ANOTHER set! This one here tho, was for my daughter who wanted her own in the same color after feeling how soft mine were & seeing how pretty they were too!So that should cover all the info that any1 would need for possibly purchasing a few pillow cases or sheet sets from HC Collection. I hope this very detailed review helps you choose a bit faster than I did & with less money spent on the wrong sets 1st!This set in my opinion was money well spent and I\u2019d for sure purchase them again & again. And have!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The most AMAZING sheets I've ever slept on!",
                "reviewText": "Wow! These sheets are utter incredible, fantastic, a dream come true...no really, they truly are!!! I had purchased sheets before through Amazon, & I liked them alright. They were 100% Egyptian cotton, which I thought felt was the softest sheets to sleep on, so I was going to just order the same exact sheet set again! Boy am I glad I didn't! I saw the reviews for this company, for this sheet set, & based upon the description & the glowing reviews, I decided to buy these sheets, & try them out! Best decision EVER!!! Listen, apparently I didn't know what soft actually felt like! Because THESE sheets are SO, SOOO soft, it's like sleeping on a fluffy cloud! So light, & airy, so soft & lovely! it made my previous sheets feel like I had been, sleeping on sandpaper! Ha! Well not literally, but you get my point! The pockets are advertised as 'deep', which is a quality I look for in a fitted sheet, due to my extra thick mattress. Well let me tell you, this fitted sheet really DOES have deep, fitted corners! A lot of sheet sets will be advertised as such! Only you go to make the bed, & you find yourself literally wrestling with the fitted sheet...trying to get all four corners on & then attempting to make certain that they stay on! It's so aggravating! These sheets go on easily & then stay on, for a good nights sleep! My husband flips & flops around a lot in his sleep, & any sheets we've ever owned, eventually pops off, on at least one corner. Then in turn, the fitted sheet bunches up into a big messy pool of fabric on top of the mattress. It proves to become an awkward & uncomforqble nights sleep! So we buy & use sheet clips to keep the fitted sheet tacked down. The problem is, not all fitted sheets are long enough, for the clips to attach them to the bottom sides on the mattress. Then those that do, are sometimes barely able to reach. So when the flopping commences, the clip & sheet both will pop off the mattress & it is SOO aggravating! This fitted sheet is a dream! My husband is no longer getting angry, as he gets the fitted sheet, clipped on the sides to the mattress! Let me tell you, once it's clipped down, it stays down, until WE unclip it, to change the sheets & wash them. Which incidentally, this sheet set launders nicely as well! There is nothing I don't like about our new sheet set! What a smart purchase this was! At first, I was concerned about how the quality of the sheets would be, considering the great low cost of the set. But after reading the reviews, I thought, ok, what the heck, let's try them out. Man am I glad I did! Hands down the best purchase I've ever made, where sheets are concerned! I know 'change' is hard sometimes, & our inclination is to simply stick with what we know! But honestly, you really SHOULD try these out! I am SO glad that I did! I am also grateful that I had the forethought to double down & buy two sets! My thinking was, what the heck, why not?! They are so inexpensive, you can afford to purchase two sets! Because basically that's how much I would have spent on just one set, had I repurchased the sheet set I bought the last time! Believe me, you WILL fall in love with these sheets! So when you begrudgingly remove them to launder them, you can simply put your other set right back on! Because once you sleep on these sheets, you will definitely NOT want to put an old set on, in their place! You'll never want to sleep on any of your other sheets again actually! Because once you feel how amazing these sheets feel, you'll be hooked like I am! Seriously! I do NOT know, how they pack that much luxury, that much quality, or that much durability, into that low, low price?! Don't confuse the cost with being 'cheap' either, because they are anything but! They are inexpensive, but definitely NOT cheap! They have DO many colors to choose from too, which is near! There is something to match every color palette out there! Unlike a lot of companies, who only offer the basic white & cream colors. Lastly, & believe me, I know this is going to sound like a ridiculous detail. But I loved how they came packaged! I know, I know, that sounds silly! They were folded up in a neat & tidy clear plastic zipper pouch, which was cool. But what I loved & thought was such a neat touch, was where the zipper pull is, they have looped on there, a sweet little cream colored tassel! I just thought it was an added bonus & made the sheet set look especially classy! It was easily removed & I attached it onto a lamp in my bedroom. Again, I realize I sound ridiculous, to be excited about a tassel! But sometimes, it's just little touches that make all the difference! Oh & by the way, this company has impeccable customer service skills! As soon as I placed my order, I was notified by them that my order was received, setting my expectations for what would happen next. I eventually received a tracking number for my shipment, & was told when the package could be expected. I actually received the order ahead of when I was told that I would, which was an unexpected delight. All the way around, I've had nothing less than a stellar experience! I am more than satisfied & they have a customer now for life! I am not a person who will typically stop & leave a review either. Because I shop online a lot, & it would become very cumbersome to 'review' each item I purchase. But in this case, I actually wanted to do a review! I want everyone to hear about my positive experience, so that perhaps it will help them to make the smart decision to purchase these sheets for themselves! If you love your spouse, if you love yourself, do yourselves a favor, & buy yourself at least one, if not more, sets of these AMAZING sheets! You will thank yourself later, I promise!!!",
