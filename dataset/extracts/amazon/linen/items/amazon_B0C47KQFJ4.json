The fit is perfectly oversized & you can make them as high-waisted as you want (the crotch is low so you can pull up/down to suit your taste). I\u2019m 5\u20193 & these hit my ankle perfectly. These are such a fun spin on cargo-style pants, perfect for summer or fall! I will absolutely be ordering more colors.Edit: I washed them in the washing bc machine & hung them to dry- they shrunk in length a little bit. It\u2019s not an issue for me at all since I\u2019m short (5\u20193 & they hit my ankle now) but if you\u2019re taller, hand wash only! I love these pants SOOOO much! I\u2019m currently placing my second order for more colors. I can\u2019t get over how luxurious they feel & how cute they are. Buy them!",

                "reviewText": "first i love the look, and the feel of the fabric. i love that it combines some lightness of rayon with natural feel of linen. looks just l like pic, not fake pictures. cute boho look. problem is 1. how much they shrunk. a good 6 inches of length just from cool wash and low heat drying, and in all other places too. at first they reached my ankle bone, after washing they are halfway up my shins (i'm 5'6). still cute but a lil goofier. whatever. i still love the flowy natural look. 2. they RIPPED on first wash. the seam down front of leg. i made sure not to wash with anything hard like zipper, button, etc because i know rayon is so delicate when wet. so why did they rip? quality i guess. 3. the inside satin feel lining is WEIRD haha. i cut it out because i don't want that extra layer of restriction around my booty. i wanted these for the loose flowy feel to wear during yoga practice and in nature so the lining just was not compatible. it's easy enough to cut out though. bottom line, still cute, but wash very carefully and make sure to size up! I am 135lb, 5'6, big booty, got size M but will size up to at least a L if there's a next time.",

This color is not see through as there is a lining from waist to knee.For reference, I purchased a large in Light Apricot. The color appears more light beige than apricot. I'm 5 foot 1 and 160 pounds. To get the length at my ankle I have the waistband below my belly button. If I wear them on my waist they are a cropped length.",

Unfortunately, they shrunk significantly after one wash, probably about 3\u201d in length. They now look ridiculous. The fabric looks completely worn as well, like they\u2019re years old. Unfortunately I am returning these. POOR quality save your money.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted some lightweight comfy pants that would be good for spring, summer, and fall but ones that also looked put together. I took a chance and bought these in white (hoping they weren\u2019t sheer) and they did not disappoint!!! They have a shorts length liner in them that goes right down to where the pockets end and the liner really isn\u2019t visible from the outside, like you\u2019d REALLY have to be looking for something to notice. To test the sheerness and be ABSOLUTELY sure when they came in I tried them on with a pair of neon hot pink lace hipster underwear. I was squatting, bending, doing all the tests and asking a third party if they could be seen so I can with 100% confidence report back that you are safe in them! Obviously I wouldn\u2019t try to wear neon underwear out in them but this proves that it would be safe to wear pretty much any color undies with them if you get behind on laundry and it\u2019s necessary.Also to note, I\u2019m 5\u20194 195 lbs. these come just below my ankles so if you\u2019re any taller keep that in mind! I personally love the length because things are usually way too long on me but it\u2019s worth noting. Pants are nice and soft, pockets are huge. They\u2019re so comfy I will definitely be buying more colors!",
