Usually I only buy cotton with spandex, but I took a chance on this after reading the measurements. it fit, but not with the required ease that a linen garment needs.The Pros: This is a beautiful, well made garment. The color is saturated and the fabric is great. the ties on the shoulder are adorable, and make it easy to put on and take off.The Cons: sizing. When you make a garment out of linen, the ease needs to be significantly larger than if it's a more flexible, stretchable material. There is no give in linen. So, if you're even close to the higher edge of the measurements, size up. If you're at the top end of the measurements, take a pass on this one.It's beautiful, but the disappointment isn't necessary.",

Very comfortable for summer, not too tight for summer. Goes great with a body suit underneath. I always get compliments when I wear it. It has been a cute/ casual staple for me to wear this summer and on trips. Straps are adjustable, you just tie and untie into knots in the front. Shorts part of the item are a great length, not too long or too short. No weird sagging in the crotch. Love this item, have sent the link for multiple friends that loved it on me as well. Washing- I usually use a delicate cycle and hang dry just to be safe and prevent shrinking and so far that has worked well for multiple washes.",

It was too high in the crotch, and not long enough on the top. When I\u2019ve hold it down low enough for it to hang properly in the groin area, then the opening of the bib was just above my abdomen. Also, I didn\u2019t pay attention to the photographs close enough when purchasing, and thought that there were buttons to attach the front and back. It\u2019s really just a hole where you push the straps through and tie a knot. Just looks super cheap. I did like the material, it was nice and cool, and the openings for the shorts are very wide, so if you have a larger thighs, that\u2019s a great thing. Overall, this just looked terrible on my body. For the record I am a size 12/14",

It\u2019s very light weight and comfortable and I like that you can adjust the length of the romper as needed with the tie straps. I ordered a large and it is roomy enough to have a relaxed fit, but I have long legs so it rides up just a bit.It will definitely shrink however, so be very careful with how you wash/dry this. The pockets are not very functional for anything other than small items like keys (or a pacifier in my case). They will not hold your phone securely and it will fall out. I also struggle with getting the straps to look nice but that\u2019s because I am incapable of tying them properly, so others might have better luck than I do.Other than that, I recommend this for an easy cute outfit that is very versatile.",
