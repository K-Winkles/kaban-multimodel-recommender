So if you need great coverage that's modest this is the item. It has pockets that is a plus for me. It's thin so you will need to wear something under it. It flows nice and the fabric is airy. I purchased a 2X so I can have some room to move around. It falls perfectly on my short frame. I will order in another color. This is a great garment",

                "reviewText": "It has that neat designer look, for that price it's a good buy.Only thing weird is the placement of those baggy bulges on the sides. They land in an unflattering level...like having massive saddlebags lol. I have narrow boy hips so it makes me laugh. I'll tailor that in to be a smooth line which is very very flattering then.Fabric - fairly scratchy to be sure. Not terrible, and once washed I'm sure it'll soften more so don't take this too strongly. It is linen.Size - totally right. Rare for amazon dresses, but yeah, I'm 5'7\" 138 and a small fits well. (I'm typically a medium or small dress size, an 8 usually - it's my broad shoulders and height that slip me into medium sometimes). These shoulders are a touch snug but I can stretch them while it's wet. Being a bulky design I always err as small as I can, so small it is.Color - no, that pic is def NOT the dolor of the dress. Add 50% medium blue to that color and then you have what this is. I buy lots of greens (have green eyes), this is out of my box being teal. A muted, dark-ish teal. Nice, but I suspect they sell more showing it as green..that color is a bit nicer then this. Still, it's $20 bucks, and a good buy for that.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because the description stated that it was a cotton-linen dress. I live in Arizona - the anvil of the sun - and I wanted something that would be as cool as possible to wear.Here is the text from the description: \"SOFT & BREATHABLE FABRIC: Our plus size linen caftan/kaftan dress is made using a blend of Linen and Cotton to bring you a vintage boho linen dress that you can comfortably wear all day. It\u2019s ideal for both indoor and outdoor use to cover you from neck to ankle while making sure you look good.\"Strangely, there was no fabric content label anywhere on the dress. As far as I can tell, this dress is made of polyester. I took a flame to a thread from the dress and it melted, not burned. Also, there is no airflow through the dress - it traps the heat next to the body. Another clue about the fiber content is that the laundry instructions tell you to put it in the dryer on \"moderate to high temperature.\" I have never had a linen garment with instructions to put it in the dryer at a high temperature. Additionally, wonder of wonders, the garment hardly wrinkles at all - when does that ever happen with a linen-cotton blend? I'm wearing a linen-cotton blend shirt at the moment in our most recent heat advisory weather (temperature 103 degrees at 4,500 foot elevation) and it is vastly more comfortable than this dress made from synthetic fibers, and the fabric is wrinkled as is characteristic of these fibers. Other than the basic misrepresentation about the fabric of the dress (which is the basis for the one-star rating), it looks good and will probably be comfortable at temperatures in the 70's and possibly 80's F. Regarding the fit, I usually wear a medium and ordered an XL in this because of comments in some of the reviews. It works for me because I wanted it loose everywhere.",

I followed the advice from the reviewers to size all the way up (5X) if you're around a size 12. Although torso-wise the dress had just enough room, the dress was far too long and the slit for the chest area ended up being somewhere mid-stomach (I'm 5'4\"). It was like a long narrow dress on me, but the sleeves were the right length. I wasn't a fan of the material either. It felt like a rough burlap sack against my skin rather than linen.",

                "reviewText": "I love this dress as a swimsuit cover-up. It's great on hot days when you are in and out of the pool all the time so you don't have to change and then change back into your suit as soon as you come back. I wouldn't wear it as a regular dress as it is too casual for anything other than trips to the store or to a friends and around the house when you don't want to be changing into and out of your suit all the time.I wear this dress all the time and it washes up very well, no loose threads or thin seams as you often get with Asian made clothing (I frequently buy clothing from AliExpress which is kind of like a Chinese eBay and find that I frequently find the exact same clothing here on Amazon but for twice the price so I always go to AliExpress first and search the brand name first and just scan for that item, if it is an item which says we use Asian sizes chances are you will find it on AliExpress for half the price. You can also tell it is coming from China when you buy it on Amazon as the wait time will not be a few days, it will be a few weeks. This dress was about the same price on both sites so I always prefer to buy on Amazon and will do so if the difference is less than $5 or $10 dollars because there is always a slight risk buying directly from AliExpress as the language barrier is really bad and communication is difficult).",
