                "reviewText": "HOTOUCH Linen Cotton Womens Short Sleeve Shirts V Neck Collared Button Down Blouse Tops with Chest PocketI got this shirt because I enjoy a nice button down short sleeve shirt for work and for the outdoors in the summer. I've washed it and tried it on, but haven't worn it yet because it is out of season.It is a nice lightweight cotton, but does not feel see through. The cotton does have a slight linen-like texture. In the pictures I posted, I washed and air dried the shirt, which created a slightly wrinkled look. I can't speak to how it will look coming out of the dryer, but I suspect it would be one of those items you want to pull out and hang immediately after drying.The seams on the shirt are good quality. The inner seams are serger type seams, with nice fine stitching on visible outer seams.I usually order a size medium or small depending on the brand. From the measurements on the listing, I could have gone with a small, as the bust measurement matched mine, however I have wide shoulders so I decided to go with a medium. The cut of the shirt seems akin to a \"boyfriend\" or relaxed cut, so I am curious as to whether a small would have worked for me; the medium feels a little bulky. I would suggest sizing down if you are in between sizes. As far as the shoulder issue goes, there is not a shoulder seam joining the sleeve to the blouse, it is instead constructed with two pieces (front and back) put together. This may create the somewhat boxy/ less tailored feel but it also means that if you have wide or narrow shoulders you don't have to worry about the shoulder seam not matching your shoulder.Not having worn it, I don't know if the color will show sweat, but the cut seems favorable to reducing sweat on the shirt.Overall this feels like a serviceable shirt which will probably look nice tucked into pants or tied up, and probably better with some structure underneath. The one strange aspect of the shirt is the pocket. The placement and size feels off visually; it is a little small and too high. It is off just enough to make me want to get out the seam ripper and remove it.I would recommend this shirt if you want cotton/ natural fiber, and want a boxy or relaxed cut. If you like a more tailored look, you may be disappointed with this shirt.Once the weather warms up, if I have more insights after wearing the shirt, I will add that information.",

                "reviewText": "Reviewing HOTOUCH Linen Shirts for Women Cotton, I don\u2019t know why they can\u2019t make up their mind in this listing about whether this shirt is 100% Linen or 100% Cotton. They\u2019re not the same. To be honest, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s either. I think it\u2019s a viscose blend. Maybe it\u2019s blended with Cotton or Linen (in a small percent), but it\u2019s mainly Viscose. That said, it\u2019s a nice shirt and I think most people would agree that Viscose can be a nice fabric when finished properly, so I would\u2019ve ordered it if they had been honest and wouldn\u2019t have deducted any stars for it but since I suspect this is not 100% Cotton or Linen, even though it says it\u2019s 100% Cotton, I\u2019m removing one star. I have a relative that is allergic to Viscose, so if she had ordered this, she would\u2019ve had to send it back. Not accurately reflecting the material is a big deal.That said, the shirt is nice. It\u2019s not so thick it\u2019s hot, but it\u2019s not so thin that it\u2019s transparent. It\u2019s a nice, summer weight. As with all made-for-amz brand clothing, I ordered a size up (also to protect from shrinking, since I thought it was going to be 100% cotton). It fits well. One thing that I often find annoying with the cheaper clothes on amz, is the buttonholes. They are usually too small for the buttons, but this shirt doesn\u2019t have that issue. The buttonholes are sized nicely for the buttons that are on it.This shirt needs to be ironed with first use, mainly because of being compressed during shipping. Since it\u2019s not pure cotton, it stays surprisingly unwrinkled as long as you take it out of the dryer promptly. I chose to hang dry, which does require a light steaming. The color is a nice, muted Rose (I ordered Rusty Rose) and it doesn\u2019t bleed in the wash. Overall, I really like this shirt.",

It fits really well and is very well made too! I like that it has a pocket in the front. I always think that a pocket makes any shirt look better. The fit is perfect for me...it is not loose and it is not close fitting either. What I also like about this shirt is that it can be dressed up or down and still look very good. Because of this style versality, I have worn this shirt on casual Friday and also during the week when business casual is required. I got this shirt in pink and it is very pink and I absolutely love the color!! The collar was a little weird-fitting when I got it, but that settled out a bit. I think it was weird because of the way it was packaged. Anyway, I am over the top pleased with this shirt! I like it so much that I am considering purchasing another one in another color that I've had my eye on.",
