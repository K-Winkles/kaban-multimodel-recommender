                "reviewText": "It took me probably a year to buy this duvet. It's been sitting in my saved-for-later and wish list for months and months. You see, I am incredibly picky with bedding. I am a hot sleeper and absolutely cannot stand being too hot. There is nothing worse to me in the world. I run the AC nonstop in the summer and have windows open in the winter. Two words will absolutely turn me off from any duvet: 1. ~soft~ and 2. warm. No, It needs to feel like cool water woven into fabric. Smooth but not silk or satin. Cool but not flimsy. Heavy but not hot. No flannel, no microfiber, no ~soft~.Typically I look for percale but that severely limits my color choices. Almost all brands only make white, grey, maybe sage in percale sheets and duvets. Boring. So I kept returning to this duvet in my saved-for-later. Will I/ Won't I? Finally, I figured what the hell it's cheap and it's amazon so I can just return it. And I'm tired of searching and praying for percale brands to get their shit together and offer a color selection. I mean it's been a battle for years.Does this duvet feel like cool water woven into fabric? No. But is it ~soft~? Also No. Is it itchy/scratchy? ehhhhh not really. However, I do not get too hot and it comes in a million colors, both of which is what we established are most important here. Are you going to like this duvet? I don't know. Probably not, and I guess you can blame me. But I'm here to tell you that if your priorities are at least similar to mine, It's worth trying this duvet out. And if you love it, hey it's cheap and you can get a color for every season if you're an indecisive freak like me. Just give it a shot.",

                "reviewText": "I've ordered a lot of duvet covers and this, by far, my favorite. The fabric is a soft cotton that looks like a good quality, brushed linen. I ordered the natural linen color and it is perfect with the moss green sheets, shams, and natural throw pillows I chose to go with it. I order a 90x90 duvet insert to fit this 90x90 duvet cover, and it was a perfect fit. The duvet cover has 8 ties on the inside so you can attach it to the duvet insert (my insert only has four loops, and it would have been nice if it had eight loops to attach to all the ties), but the duvet insert still feels secure just using the four ties provided. The duvet cover also has a hidden zipper, which i must prefer over the buttons. I think the zipper is much more secure than buttons The material does have some wrinkling, but that is part of the look, and with this duvet cover, you can just brush them out with your hand, and it looks perfect. i like this duvet cover enough that I may order a second one just to have on hand should something happen to this one... I love it that much. It is well-made, feels wonderful to sleep under, and it looks beautiful on our bed. My husband even loves it, and for him to even notice it, is saying something. It is an excellent value for the price, so I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is worth every penny, and more. Do yourself a favor, and buy this duvet cover while you can. You won't regret it!",

                "reviewText": "Ordered in the olive and it is a beautiful color - very deep and rich. The fabric is lightweight but the color and bit of texture make it look substantial. Initially I gave this duvet cover 3 stars because the actual dimensions were smaller than advertised. The actual dimensions of the king duvet cover that I ordered were closer to 96x84 than the 104\"x90\" as advertised. At first I thought maybe I had received a queen set by mistake, but the shams fit well on a king pillow. I did wash it before putting it on my bed, so maybe it shrunk a little but that is a significant difference. I re-ordered an oversize king to account for the loss of 6\" each dimension hoping that it would fit my standard king bed since the color is very nice. That measured about 94x106 - again much smaller than advertised - but a good fit for my king bed. Because I liked it enough to order another one that fit, I am raising my rating to 4 stars, but if you have a king bed you might want to consider ordering a larger size than you think you'll need.",
