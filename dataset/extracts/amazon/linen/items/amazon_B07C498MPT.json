I ordinarily wear a medium and will be sending back--for a medium?? The XL is very large on me. It's as if I received a different product than some of the reviews. Very classic design and good quality. No unexpected detailing at the collar, etc. The fabric is a little coarse, but I anticipate it will soften with time. I do like the covered buttons.This review has been sitting while I decide whether to re-order in a smaller size. I read recent reviews to see if the sizing comments have changed. Everyone still says size way up, and the XL I ordered swallowed me up. I guess I will try for the medium and see how it goes. Really like the shirt. Ordered the denim blue. I'm looking for a work shirt.Update: I re-ordered size medium. Fits true to size. I am a 36A, 5\u20184\u201c 140 pounds. This is a very well-made blouse. I would not call it a tunic, but it does fall to cover my rear end. It seems to wash well. I hang on the line to dry",

One fit great, one was too big, and this one was too small! Makes it hard to purchase but I do really like the styles and prices and the fabric holds its shape well. I have not tried washing them yet, however.",

It is true to size, but it\u2019s NOT a loose fitting shirt. If you\u2019re looking for a flowy fit, you\u2019ll need to size up. If you want it to fit like a regular shirt, get your regular size.2. You will have to wash it before wearing it. The material is a little rough from the linen, but if you want to soften it, you\u2019ll have to wash it before wearing.Overall, it\u2019s a good value. I may get another one (in a different color) in my regular size and one in a different color in one size larger for a flowy tunic.",

                "reviewText": "I'm 5'3\" 123 lb. 30D bra size, typically size small(4-6) in tops.....after reading reviews I went wayyy up in size, XL to be exact.So, bc I did my research, it fits as expected. Very loose, long body, 3/4 sleeves. In my opinion it's perfect, just as the pictures show. Blue color is true to photos, material IS a bit scratchy at first but after wearing for a short while I got used to it. I have pretty sensitive skin typically, fabrics like wool I absolutely cannot wear, but this top isn't nearly that bad, just takes a little getting used to. I also think it may soften up after a few washings....also seems to be well made, stitching is nice and neat, buttons are sewn on pretty strong. I usually put a coat of clear polish on my buttons anyway, just to give them a little extra protection (that one's for free \ud83d\ude18)I wish more people would take photos for their reviews, so I took 4 in the hopes that it helps future shoppers. Last one is to show what you could pair it with to make a cute outfit.",
