Breathability: The heat dissipation performance of linen is 5 times that of wool and 19 times that of silk. In hot weather, wearing linen clothing can make people's skin surface temperature better than wearing silk and cotton fabrics or other fabrics. 3-4 degrees lower. 2. Dryness: Linen cloth can absorb water equivalent to 20% of its own weight, and at the same time, it can quickly release the absorbed water. No matter how much sweat, it can keep it dry. 3. Reduce perspiration: help maintain the body's electrolyte balance. Studies have shown that linen clothing can make the human body sweat 1.5 times less than wearing other cotton clothing. 4. Anti-static: Only 10% flax in the blended fabric is sufficient for anti-static. It can effectively alleviate people's restlessness, headache, chest tightness, and difficulty breathing in a static environment.",

The first pair I bought was a large, which fits fine, especially for pyjama bottoms, but I then bought a second pair in extra large These are a little roomier, and more comfortable to knock around in. I like them so much I now have four pairs - two in each size. Despite what others have said, given the cotton/linen blend, I was amazed at how little these pants shrink - even when dried in the dryer. And the fabric becomes softer and softer the more you wash them. Just a great all-around pair of summer and/or vacation pants",
