I am 5\u20198\u201d and 150 pounds and ordered a medium and fits great\u2026however the adjustable straps are too long on last hole, but too short in torso for next size up, so they are longer than I\u2019d like but cause major wedgie on other strap slot. It is somewhat flattering with the right undershirt (I paired with a cropped racer back tank), more figure friendly than I thought it would be for my shape! I love the breezy comfort, style and color options too! Great for summer, but can also work for fall and spring. They\u2019re baggy, which can look frumpy not styled correctly, but overall (no pun intended), a super cute and comfortable little outfit!!",

I ordered true to size using sizing chart and the overalls fit perfectly! The tulip leg is flattering, the buttons are securely fastened and the INSIDE button is used to affix straps. Bought black and navy and am very pleased! They are lightweight, yet sturdy and feel so comfy, roomy (even with my hips). 5' 6\", 190 pounds - got the Large.Highly recommend for these hot days. Looks great styled as others are doing with a simple tank.PS - tried another version on Amazon with the wide leg pants and rouching at stomach and they were awful - too baggy! Those went back (from another Amazon vendor).GET these here - you won't be disappointed!",

I am SWIMMING in this. It\u2019s so baggy I\u2019m torn between getting a M or a S.UPDATE: Switched to 5 stars- I ended up sizing down two sizes and kept the size small. This is incredibly rare for me to be a small. It was a little tight over my butt pulling it on but fits perfectly once buttoned.",

The first day, the threads for the button on the right unraveled and after a few wears, it completely popped off.Other than that, it\u2019s sooooo comfortable. I have never been so breezy and cool before than I am in this. I used it for gardening and I felt great in it. The fabric is soft and breathable. Washes well too. I love that it has pockets and the sides are high enough that I could wear a yoga bra and not show skin on the side.I am a medium on top and large on the bottom so I got a large based on other reviews. Glad I did. Fits loose even after washing looks great.Please fix the buttons!!!",
