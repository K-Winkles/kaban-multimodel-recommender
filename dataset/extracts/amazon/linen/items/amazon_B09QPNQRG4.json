A:It is not see through but but we recommend wearing a nude or light-colored bra or underwear. Q:Will it wrinkle or shrink after washed? A:Due to the special nature of our shirt fabric, slight wrinkles are inevitable, we recommend ironing with an iron before wearing. We have done pre-shrinking treatment during production, so it will not shrink after washing. Q:Can the clothes be machine washed?

The fabric is comparably heavy, thick: cotton/linen blend (or so the tag claims) for a shirt/blouse; not light and breezy summer fabric. Super wrinkly-- as to be expected from the natural fibers. Just wish the fabric was lighter.Worst: the sleeves are too short, barely reach my wrist and the bottom of the shirt barely covers my waistband. If I tuck it in, I have only 2\" of fabric to tuck (pulled taught) and then it comes untucked as soon as I move.SUPER unflattering.I know this is a CHEAP blouse, but save your money.I ordered the blue color and it very close to as-pictured. Pretty blue. If you're a petite XS person and want to order the XXL, and don't mind the heavy fabric, you might like it?",

The small is 1 inch narrower - and when I wear the medium, there is not really a big difference. They are both loose and comfy. Nice material - not too thin - but I would use it to avoid the sun and mosquitos. I am 128lbs 5.4ft - and I like my clothes with a little room. But in this case, if someone asks, I would keep the small one. I like them so much that I bought all the colors in both sizes - Small and Medium. Just in case!!",
