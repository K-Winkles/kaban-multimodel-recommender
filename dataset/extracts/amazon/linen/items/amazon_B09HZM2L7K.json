But at this time of climate crisis the most important benefit of this amazing fabric is the fact that it can be sustainably produced and processed. More Durability When you buy good quality products for your home you not only surround yourself with beautiful things, you also help reduce waste. Cheaper disposable homewares often end up in landfill, whereas a linen tablecloth or linen bedlinen set will last for years. While there may be a bigger financial outlay in the first place, you will find you're actually saving money in the long run as you won't need to replace things as often. Linen has long been passed down as heirlooms through generations, showing just how much wear and use it can withstand. Machine Washing Thanks to the fact that linen washes well in machines and is tumble-dryable you don't need to worry about spills or stains. Our linen is machine washable and dries more quickly than cotton, which makes caring for your kitchen linens orlinen clothes really simple. In fact, they will get better with every wash.Instead, you can add a touch of laid-back elegance and easy charm to your table every day!",
