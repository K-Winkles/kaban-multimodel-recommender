                "reviewText": "I find stand collars very flattering so I often search them out. And I bought this jacket primarily for that reason, fully expecting I would seam up the flared sides. But it was such fun to wear and so stylish as is, especially worn buttoned and paired with skinny ankle pants or capris, I not only didn\u2019t seam it up I went back for a second one. And I will no doubt have all three before it\u2019s over.Several notes: \u2014I am a busty (36DD) size 10 and the size medium fit me perfectly. \u2014My arms are far from skinny and I often find Chinese-made garments too constricting in the sleeves and armholes. This jacket in beige fits comfortably in those areas, although i can\u2019t say the cut is particularly generous. The grey one was more constricting when I first put it on, and on investigation I found that the seams had been sewn wider. I let them out (just clipping the threads on the inside seam of both the sleeves and sides a couple of inches down starting at the armhole, and letting the outside seam and edge binding hold the garment together), and it\u2019s now as comfortable as the other one. \u2014The grey one is darker (more charcoal) than it looks in the photo and also has grey buttons (matching the color of the fabric), rather than white as shown.. At first I was disappointed, wanting to pair it with white pants, but when I tried it with other color pants I found the color and grey buttons made it much more versatile.All in, this jacket is a fabulous find, especially for the money. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve had one that made me this happy.",
