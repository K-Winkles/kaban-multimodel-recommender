                "reviewText": "These are nice heavy duty cargo pants. they are literally a fisherman\u2019s dream! These pants have pockets pretty much everywhere! You have the traditional front pockets and back pockets plus cargo pockets on the side of the legs that are pretty big!The fabric is heavy duty, and the waist is elastic with a drawstring tie to tighten it up. They have a very loose relaxed, comfortable fit. All the stitching is done extremely well. You can tell these are pants that are built to last.The only problem that we had with them is the length. My husband is not exceptionally tall, 5\u201911\u201d and normally wears a 32-34 inch inseam. These are very short on him, going up over his ankles - which is an absolute dealbreaker for us when it comes to men\u2019s long pants.We love to go fishing! These pants are very nice in every other way. I hope they work out better for you!",

He would have been better with probably an XL instead, especially since he\u2019s lost some weight. Besides that, they are really nice! They are comfortable for him and the length is perfect! I\u2019d definitely recommend these, I might get a pair for my youngest son too!",

It does have a paper-like texture that crinkles and folds.That being said, they were decent to be worn around the house and to be used in times when you don't want to wreck your good comfy pants. I gave them to a male family member that liked the adjustable waist band. But he felt the size was very large for an XL. The cuff around the ankles were really loose and made him feel like he was in some MC Hammer pants.",

I probably could've gotten away with the Large size but I ordered 2xl because I never know what I'm going to get. I like that the waist is cut just a little low around the waist. For me that means the crotch doesn't hang down so far that it makes my legs look short. They look like they're made well and I like the material. The waist is elastic with a string tie. So, for me, that means even though they are just a little loose I can sinch them up a bit. These pants go great with a similar shirt I just ordered.",
