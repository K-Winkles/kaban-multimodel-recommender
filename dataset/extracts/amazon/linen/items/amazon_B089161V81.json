        "description": "When it comes to men's sleepwear options, there are only a few that capture the true essence of in-home, lounge wear, befitting the modern man, especially when he is leisure and at play. Fruit of the Loom Men's Woven Broadcloth Sleep Pant is the kind of sleep pant that you put on and never want to take off. You'll find yourself reluctantly removing them in the morning when it's time for work. When the weekend comes, though, it's all about the woven sleep pant! The pants keep you warm and snuggly throughout the day and night. The relaxed fit is perfect for either hanging around the house or tackling any projects on your to-do list. With two side slit pockets with plenty of storage space (for the remote control, your mobile phone and a few random knick-knacks here and there), you can stay on the couch without having to get up, except maybe when it's time to fix a snack or a meal. The elasticized waistband with the hidden twill tape draw cord gives you the freedom to adjust the fit as needed. Fruit of the Loom has truly hit it out of the ballpark with these woven broadcloth pants, ideal for the modern man.",

                "reviewText": "Found these on sale and bought a pair. Tried them on and immediately bought a pair in every other color I could find in my size (M).Very lightweight and breathable. Not see through. There is one button on the fly so they don't gap open. You may want to tack down the rest of the fly with a stitch or two, but I don't think it's necessary. The fabric is a 60/40 (or thereabouts) cotton poly. Not the most luxurious fabric, but soft enough for me. The deep pockets are much appreciated. You can fit a cell phone/pair of glasses easily. The waistband and all seams are very well sewn - double stitched and secure. I'm 5' 8\" and normally wear a size 8-10 and the medium fit perfect. The inseam is 29 1/2-30\" ( I found some slight variation in the ones I received) long enough for me without dragging on the floor. These are woven cotton/poly and do not stretch. If you are between sizes, definitely consider sizing up. Even though they are well stitched, too much strain on the thin fabric will eventually cause them to rip. My upper thighs are 24\" and I notice a little strain on some of the inside thigh stitches. But since I'm starting to lose some of my covid lockdown weight (boy, did I get lazy!), I think I'll be ok. I dont know about other sizes, but if you have thick/ muscular thighs, consider sizing up. I've been hand washing these - easy to do, they're so thin - and hanging them to dry. They dry completely in a couple hours. There was some excess dye run-off the first couple washes but it doesn't affect the color. I'm very happy with this purchase and will be keeping my eye out for new patterns/colors. Nighty-night!",
