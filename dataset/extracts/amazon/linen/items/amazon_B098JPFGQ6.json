                "reviewText": "Not as pictured. SCRUBSI don't have a picture. I sent them back immediately. I ordered these in a size Large. (I wear a US Medium usually. Asian XL.) Since they said loose fit and the pictures makt look flowing and oversized, I thought a large would be ok. I expected loose, wide leg design in a light linen or crepe material. Maybe even a light weight cotton blend... NO! The pants came and they were scrubs. Like nurses and doctors wear. They are stiff and straight legged. There is no flow or movement in the fabric. The large was snug in my butt. And I don't have that much junk in the trunk. Ya know? And quality bad enough that a pocket stich popped when I tried them on. Imagine what would happen if I squatted! I paid way too much for a tight pair of scrubs. Very disappointed.",

Material is itchy and uncomfortable. Pockets are sewn to the outside of the trousers and look very cheap. Not worth the cost",
