                "reviewText": "I am in love with this outfit. Though the material is a little different from what I normally like to wear- slightly stiffer- this being a dressier/ work outfit- the material and style are perfect- for the type of thing I was looking to wear for professional events outside the house (like work, meeting, church).I don\u2019t normally wear dress clothing- as I haven\u2019t worked outside the home a lot in the last two years. However, recently my medical conditions have gotten better and I have decided to do more outside the home that I am used to. So I needed some clothing to wear.I ordered this outfit in a 2XL and everything fit perfectly- from the pants to the top. I wish the top was a smidge longer- as I hate things that don't hang long over my mid-section (of my stomach). The top hung right at the point where my problem areas aren't shown however I feel a little more comfortable when- in that area- tops hang a little more than this one does. But I still love to wear the outfit outside the home- and already have worn it enough to have to wash it once.The outfit washed like a dream. My washing machine- for some reason- is set to use only hot water- no matter the choice you make on the machine- so the outfit was washed at a high temperature (however I would tell others to wash it at a lower temperature, just to be safe- from shrinking and the color possibly running the first time it was washed) and then dried completely in the dryer.There was no shrinkage after any of this- and the outfit appeared just the same as when it arrived. There wasn't even any color that ran even when the water it was washed on was at such a high temperature and there seemed to be no shrinkage- even after the outfit was totally dried in the dryer (though I would tell others to be careful when drying- I just don't have the extra space to hang clothing to dry).Even though this is classified as a \"summer outfit\" in the Amazon ad for it- I thought it would be great for winter office wear too- as long as I wore a duster jacket (or long sweater, maybe a blazer) over it. I love this outfit- despite the fact, that I would have loved a slightly longer cut on the top- it's still awesome and again, washed great!If you have any questions about this outfit, feel free to ask. I apologize for not providing photos but I would hate to model clothing online and anyway, the outfit basically looks as described and photographed on its Amazon ad.Thank you",

                "reviewText": "Ok, so to start, I LOVE this outfit. I wore in out to dinner on a beach vacay and felt really good in it. The top is super cute, but I bought it in 2 more colors just for the pants. They are perfect. stretchy waist, useable pockets! love them. But here's the thing...I washed cold and dried on low and they shrunk like 4 inches. They are crops now which will be ok for summer, but just beware. I'm 5'5\" but have short legs/long torso and always wear a petite or short and these were perfect before washing.The top is kinda cropped but I have a long torso and was able to tuck it in. I guess the pants are high wasited to make that work. When you tuck it in, it looks like a jumpsuit but it's WAY easier to use the bathroom!",

                "reviewText": "BTFBM has been a brand that has pleasantly surprised me with their consistent good quality and chic designs that are nice for their price point. I pay a lot more for high-end brands and quality for my items that last so long, and at made with excellent craftsmanship and materials, but it is refreshing to have discovered a brand on Amazon that seems to take care and consideration for the design, variety, fabrics, and overall quality of their clothing line, and at a lower price point. This is a brand that I can rely on for more casual outfits, and being a dress and skirt person, I appreciate the fashionable pieces that I have by this brand. This pants outfit is one of only a few pants sets that I have , and it looks great on. At 5\u20197\u201d, 115 pounds, the size small fits me well, and I like the length, which can be slightly adjusted depending on how high or low you wear the pants. I do not put items like this in the dryer. I have hand washed, or gentle machine washed, and hang to dry, and they do wash well. I recommend hang dry to avoid shrinking in dryer. I have been wearing this set at home, and I get many compliments on it! This is a great purchase!",

                "reviewText": "Wow. I really like this more than I thought. I love the color that I ordered (solid grey blue) and the softness of the fabric. I like the two-piece styling. This is lightweight and will be perfect for my summer cruises. The fabric is a combination of viscose and linen--that means it could shrink when washed and dried. So I will hand wash and line dry this item. I haven't worn it outside the house yet since we have winter rain and snow and freezing temperatures. I'm looking forward to wearing this in the summer.The tie goes on the side--which is a cute look. However, if you look at the picture, you will understand that it needs to be worn either without a bra or worn with a strapless bra if you don't want your bra straps to show.I am 5'1\" and weigh about 160 pounds. I normally wear a 1X or XL. However I ordered a 2X in this. It fits perfectly--except for the length of the pants--which need to be hemmed--which is true for most things I purchase. I do wish the top were a few inches longer, but it's not a deal breaker.Overall, I am pleased with this outfit.",
