                "reviewText": "A couple years ago i switched to linen bedding, i was skeptical at first but i made the decision to spend the money on a set of linen sheets. Since that day i haven\u2019t looked back and i only use linen bedding. I\u2019ve tested multiple brands but was looking for a more affordable option so i decided to give this brand a try.Here is my initial reaction:Overall they seem like good quality, there was a couple minor flaws on one pillowcase where some threads had come loose, these were part of the duvet set and not part of the sheet set but this is the reason for 4 stars. This is depicted in the photos. I trimmed the threads back and will see if any issues arise but i think it will be ok.In terms of softness, out of the box they are soft but you will definitely want to wash them before putting on your bed. I noticed the lint trap was not as full as other brands i used before so these did not shed the fibers as much, i think this means they will hold up over time really well. These will get softer with each wash which will only make them better.If you\u2019re new to linen, you have to be ok with them being a little wrinkled. I think this adds to the comfort, the fabric feels more natural and gives it a cozy look.Linen also feels different on the skin than traditional percale sheets. I like to tell people it\u2019s soft like flannel but breathes very well. There\u2019s a bit of texture to linen, it\u2019s soft but i wouldn\u2019t say it feels smooth like traditional sheets. I sleep naked and i like the way it feels on my skin. Whenever i get back home from a trip it\u2019s always my favorite thing to climb into my linen bedding and i sleep so good!when you wash and dry them, it\u2019s better to dry them on low heat and take them out before they are completely dry. Linen will air dry quickly and they will last much longer if you do this.I think these are good quality for a good price, especially if you\u2019re looking for a starter set to try out linen, these would be good for you. Just make sure you give it a fair shot and understand it may take a little adjustment period. If you take care of them they should last a very long time and get better and better.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sheets for the price",
                "reviewText": "These are, without a doubt, the most comfortable sheets I've ever slept on. They are my first experience with linen sheets, so I really have nothing to compare them to. I looked at other linen sheets on line, there are plenty on Etsy, but I was concerned about the high price and not being able to return them. Through Amazon prime I was able to purchase a 4 piece king set of pure linen sheets for only $128.99, an amazing price, as most sets will cost you a minimum of $400 and up. The reason for the low cost is that they are made in China instead of Europe, Australia or the US. The manufacturer claims the fabric is from Belgium but they're sewn in China. They are really soft and will continue to soften as you wash and sleep on them, really breaking in after about 5 washes. With that said, what I don't like about these sheets is that the fitted sheet is constantly coming loose, not sure why, maybe it is the looseness of the linen fiber, which softens and relaxes as you sleep on it or just not enough material. I have a Prana sleep mattress, it's about 12-13 inches thick, so about standard. The pillow cases are also king size and too big for my standard size pillows, I fold them over so it's no big deal. The flat sheet is perfect, ample size. I purchased the embroidery linen, which is a light grey, lighter than I thought, but the color is growing on me. As far as wrinkling goes, they are linen and that's what linen does. Personally I prefer them ironed, for me, it smoothes out the texture of the fiber so they feel less \"nubby\" and softer. If you don't have the time or inclination to iron them, I recommend not overdrying them in the dryer and when they're done immediately make your bed, as they will continue to wrinkle otherwise. Linen is best line dried in the fresh air, but most of us don't have clothes lines anymore. After having slept on these sheets for a month, I can honestly say I will never go back to cotton again. If you are menopausal or run hot when you sleep, you will love these, they are so breathable and feel amazing, cool in the summer and warm when they need to be. I can't wait to go to bed at night and don't want to get up in the mornings, they are that wonderful. Depending on how long these last, I might splurge on my next set of sheets and buy them from Rough Linen. They are definitely more expensive, and the lack of a fitted sheet had me worried (they use flat sheets on both the bottom and top), but after the problems I've been having with the fitted sheet on these not being very fitted, I may give them a go. If this is your first experience with linen sheets, like mine, I would not hesitate to try them, I'm sorry it took me this long to discover them.Update: 6 years later and I still have the same sheets. Since I bought these sheets, I have also purchased several sets of Rough Linen sheets. The quality of Rough Linen has changed over the years and is not what it once was, personally I prefer a more crisp sheet than what they sell today. If you like soft sheets, they are comparable to the Simple Opulence, but these are a fraction of the price of Rough Linen or other brands. Made in California vs made in China, so you decide what you can afford and who you want to support. Happy to have found these sheets, they\u2019re definitely long lasting and are perfect for my guest bedroom. Excellent value and long lasting.",

The fabric just keeps getting softer and still looks great with no visible signs of wear. I just bought another set and am amazed at how little the sheets have faded and worn. Side by side they are almost the same color. I am especially pleased with how well the fabric breathes and how moisture quickly disappears. Totally happy with this brand!",
