Probably going to get navy.- Can dress up or down.- Have worn shorts with another top and top with another skirt.- Its linen! Wore it to some hot day concerts and super comfy (Don't mind my to-go bev container haha).- Shorts are high waisted enough that you aren't showing your stomach unless you're really got your hands in the air, waving them like you just to don't care.Also, the Automet shorts style is the best. Ordered another seller to try in different color and wasn't a fan of the shorts. These are more tailored with a side zipper and elastic in back. Way more flattering. Others were pull on and elastic all the way around.",

There is ample stretchy elastic in the back of the shorts such that they pull on easily and were generously sized at the waist. The pleats on the front of the shorts are flattering and the top is boxy without being frumpy. I am 5'5\", DD busty, and about a size 12 right now, and ordered the XL because I didn't want it too tight. The armholes are way too big, and I need a size or two smaller. Order your regular size on this. Cute set! Would be great for travel as the pieces would mix easily with other tops and bottoms.",

I ordered a L in this set because some of the comments suggested it shrunk when drying. I washed mine, dried for a few minutes, then hung to try and it fits perfect!! The shorts are slightly big but super comfortable. I wanted longer shorts to wear in Disney, since I carry a majority of my weight in my legs/lower stomach. THESE WERE PERFECT. I would consider myself someone with larger thighs and the shorts did not ride up or leave me chafed after a full day in Epcot. The material is great and not see through. I was very comfortable all day. Great for anyone looking for something comfy they can move in!",

The shirt isn\u2019t super flattering on me, it makes me feel a bit boxy so I probably won\u2019t wear the set together but I love both pieces (this is more of a me thing lol). Great quality material, not itchy and is sturdy. Overall 9/10 def recommend!",
