I paired this vest with a light denim crop straight leg jean, a cute blazer, and and off-white mule. I got so many compliments! I loved it and when so many others did two I knew it was a winner! I order always according to the size chart and I will say that I could have sized down. There is a bunching on the front that gives a more relaxed fit and a little bit of a gap. My bust size is 39 in. So should have gone with a small. I noticed it but clearly all my customers at a clothing retailer did not. If I'd had something similar to sell at the store. I could have sold four or five! According to the chart I should have ordered a small so I would say specifically on this item go by size chart. Enjoy! :)Jeans in the photo are AG, the blazer is Walmart and the shoes are also Amazon!",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this vest because I have been looking for a lightweight summer vest to go with an outfit that I love, but needed something very specific to finish it off. This is a great option. I ordered an XXL, which is my usual size, and overall it fit quite nicely, though there is some button gap at the top button because I have a larger bust. The material feels very nice, lightweight but substantial. It feels like a quality item of clothing, at a very reasonable price. There is a soft, satiny lining inside to prevent it from clinging if you put something underneath it, and the color is exactly as pictured in the Apricot. You could certainly wear this by itself, or over another item if you want. There is a slight curve to the vest's design, so it isn't boxy, but does offer some shape for your figure, which I appreciate. Overall, I feel like this is a quality item at a great price, and I would highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I am 5'7\" and 160lbs with a 31\" waist. I normally wear between a size M and L, I ordered this in a size M and it fit as expected. I really like that it is form-fitting but not tight, I still have room to move and the buttons aren't pulling or anything.The outside of the vest is linen and it is lined inside. I really liked this because it gives the vest more structure and I personally find linen scratchy to wear (so i like the silky feeling lining). I like that it goes deep enough in front to look stylish but that I can still wear it on its own without exposing anything.It's shorter in the back than the front. I wouldn't call it cropped (which I didn't want), it hits at a very flattering point slightly below the top of a higher waisted pant. I also liked the buttons which match the fabric of the vest.This is a very nice quality vest. I washed it in my clothes washer and dried it in the clothes drier on medium heat and it looked great afterwards. So no need to handwash or air dry.Highly recommended. I was looking for a cute vest and this one is a great option and a very good price point.",

                "reviewText": "I am loving this vest.It's made out of a high quality, thick cotton, and lined for extra support. It is a little boxy, but the length is more cropped. So, it hits more at your true waist. The buttons can be worn open or closed, depending on if you'd like to wear it as a top or part of an outfit.Now, the only thing I will say about this cut is that it runs a little large. I prefer to wear me vests open and layered. You can definitely do this, but I think a ruching option at the back would ensure this top fits most. You could easily add your own cinching piece to the back, or just size down!Overall, it's a very flattering, classy, high-quality piece that would look solid with so many outfits!",

That seems like an extra touch, instead of having it just be a lining fabric.My wife says that there\u2019s one thing this vest needs to make it perfect: pockets. So far she prefers to wear it over a shirt, and not as a top all by itself.",

                "reviewText": "Vest: XL in jet black. Comes in a nice linen weave and is fully lined inside. There is no stretch to this vest and no back straps or buckles for adjustments. There are 3 buttons in the front along with an attractive hemline that dips at two points. The hem on the back side runs straight across just above the hips. I would have done better with a size L, I think, since there is slack in the arm hole area near the bust (36 C), but I will probably tack it down with a dart seam at those points, to tailor the excess and give it a more fitted appearance. Other than the issue with the size, I think this is a lovely wardrobe basic.",
