I think it runs a bit small as I got a medium in order for it to have a loose casual fit, but it fits me more like a tight jogger. But whats interesting is that even though it's fitted on me (athletic muscular build size 6 in lululemon) that it actually stretches and isn't constricting when I am moving around or even squatting down. I like it but I would size up like maybe 1-2 sizes if you want that breeziness. I'm happy I got one and will probably be getting another color too!",

                "reviewText": "These pants are very light and comfortable, perfect for the hot, miserable weather we have been having lately. Be aware that they come with a waistband that could stand the Leaning Tower of Piza back up. This waistband is NO JOKE. It is about 2 inches wide and not sewn into the pants so when you wash the pants, it twists all around with little hope of ever being orderly again. I cut the damn thing out and thus now have even more comfortable pants minus the muffin top that any two inch waistband is bound to cook up. For reference, I am 5\u20196\u201d, 145lbs (more athletic build than squishy). The pants also have a lot of extra room in the crotch, which is hard to explain because they are women\u2019s but all the same, they are cute, comfortable, affordable and I\u2019d recommend them (with a band-ectomy). Hope that helps :)",
