                "reviewText": "Y'all! These run small okay? I didn't believe other reviews until I ordered size 0 and it was too tight everywhere. So I had to reorder it in size 2. My measurements are: 5 ft tall, 102 lbs, waist 26 in, hips 34.3 in. I usually get size 0 or SX from Amazon Essentials and things would still be loose on me since I'm petite. Not these shorts though. Size 2 is perfect on me. The shorts' waist is a bit loose but comfortable and I can sit down or eat all I want with it. (With size 0, I couldn't sit down without the waistline cutting into my belly)Fabric is nice and breezy; haven't tried washing yet so I don't know if it'll shrink. The 5\" inseam is a bit long for my taste (because I'm short) but I tried rolling the hem up and y'all, it looked so cute. And the front pockets are roomy enough for my phone. I got the \"classic\" form because I want the legs to flare out a bit. Also these are high waisted and will look cute when you tuck your shirt in, especially for short girls. All in all, these shorts are great and affordable, just be careful when you select the size. (Maybe go up 1 size to be safe)",

                "reviewText": "I probably could have taken a size 1 if it were available (I have super skinny legs) but the size 2 isn't as big as I thought. Nice, comfy fit. I live in the Caribbean and I found them super comfy to wear in this tropical climate so definitely a great item to have if you're thinking of traveling somewhere warm. The quality is great, a little bit of stretch but definitely not clinging. Idk if this means anything to anyone else but they don't seem to need ironing which is a plus for me. Perfect to just grab, throw on and go. They're not too tight or short. They're perfect to wear to the different cultural events we have during the summer. Just what I was looking for. I'll definitely be ordering more in different colors. For reference, I'm 5 ft 2 on a good day and about 115 - 125lbs also on a good day",

                "reviewText": "These are nicely made, quality shorts. You might want to size up by at least one size, or go with the biggest size you sometimes wear. I have curvy bum and hips, and I usually wear a 10 to an occasional 12 depending on the cut. Since this said it was curvy style I ordered a 10. I do appreciate that with this cut probably most people can find a fit for their hips and not have gape at the waist (many shorts that fit my hips have big gape at waist but not these, yay for curvy cuts). The 10 is acceptable, and will probably stretch with wear but it\u2019s quite snug and the pockets are gaping more than I\u2019d like (I might sew the pockets down). I probably should have sized up to 12, but it\u2019s very possible once a 12 stretched out with wear the 12 would be too big. This is a traditional thick cotton fabric that has no stretch to its composition, but this material relaxes with wear, so depending on the fit you want it might actually be good to have it a bit too tight at first.",
