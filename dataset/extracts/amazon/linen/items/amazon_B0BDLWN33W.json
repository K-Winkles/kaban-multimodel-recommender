                "reviewText": "To say I am happy with these trouser\u2019s is an understatement. I am 5\u20193\u201d, and finding pants to fit has always been a nightmare. Now I am older too, and I have the rounded belly to account for. Sheesh! Pants are always too long, and too tight around the waist, or too baggy.Very badly needing new clothes, I ordered these in Navy, fully expecting to return them. I still cannot believe they fit. I listened to all the reviews and ordered Large instead of my usual XL for everything. They are fabulous! They are just a little long, but in a flattering way, like in the picture.I had expected a drawstring closure only, so I was disappointed with the elastic band, but the trousers are high-waisted, so it doesn't squeeze my tummy.These pants can be dressed up or down, perfect for any occasion. I live in a nice town where women wear exactly this look. I tried to find them last year with zero success.I still can\u2019t believe it! I ordered three more in different colors, including black. A nice pair of black trousers is a must in the wardrobe, and now I will have them in mine.Special Note: Get a bit wrinkly after washing when hung to dry.",

They are thick enough to not show panty lines but lightweight enough to be cool. They did come pretty creased, but the steamer took care of that in just a couple of minutes. Fit really well. I am 5' 7\" and do have extra long legs, so if you are on the shorter side, they might be a little long, but for me they were perfect.",

Material and quality is ok which is why I gave it 2 stars. No point in exchanging to get another pair that\u2019s ridiculously short.
