It feels really comfortable and lightweight without being too see-through or sheer, but it does wrinkle pretty quickly and it\u2019s a little linty straight out of the package (see the close up pic.) based on some other clothing items I have with a similar blend, I expect this to pill in some areas.The fit is oversized, and the wide legs are super wide, but I like the waist being elastic to give it a bit of shape. I got it to wear on a trip to a very warm country with more conservative views on dress. I think it works perfectly to stay cool, and look cute with full coverage.",

The fit was a bit loose, which is flattering with the style, but will probably change after laundering (cotton/linen fabric).The only thing that is maybe not 100% are the buttons down the back. I was able to manage them on my own at this point, but I wonder if I will with repeated laundering. Maybe a zipper would be more wearer-friendly?All-in-all, I am very happy with this purchase. I certainly couldn\u2019t beat it for the price.",

I ended up returning both because the XL was way too big and it didn\u2019t seem like it would shrink to the right size with washing. The Large fit perfectly but would have shrunk too much after a wash to wear it again. Also, this suit has a lot of fabric. I think dry cleaning is the only way to deal with it especially if you\u2019re not a fan of ironing because this will need it and a lot of it in account of the amount of fabric. The button up back is inconvenient for getting in or out of the garment.",
