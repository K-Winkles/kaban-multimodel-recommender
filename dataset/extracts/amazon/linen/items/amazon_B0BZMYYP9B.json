                "reviewText": "Bought these because I was tired of flimsy, synthetic \"deep pocket\" sheets sliding around on my mattress. Washed/dried, and they fit nicely on my 13\" full mattress, but would still fit a thicker one. Love the feel of real cotton, durable weave, the kind that lasts. SO happy to climb into these sheets at night. Color is beautiful. Great purchase.",

                "reviewText": "First off, some of the reviews I have read on the negative side, are nothing at all what I experienced. They are thick and silky smooth at first feel. I bought these on sale and in all fairness, had I not known the feel of 800 or 1000 thread count sateen sheets, I might not have been bothered by this purchase, but alas I do. I paid the same for these, as my 800 and have to say they are not nearly as soft after washing. I did not try sleeping on them, because I wanted to make sure I returned them unused. You might ask why I would buy this low of a thread count when I I paid the same for 800? Honestly, after reading so much on thread count and cotton, etc. my head was ready to explode. I wanted to see if there was that big of a difference and if all the hoopla was warranted. Well, yes, it is. I washed both sets of sheets at the same time, almost the exact same color, and upon pulling them out of the dryer, and immediately touching the sheets, could feel that there was a huge difference in the fabric. I wasn't yet sure which was which, so I separated them. I then went back on line to match the brand to the sheet sets and confirm which was the 450 and the 800. It was the 800 that was super soft. I couldn't justify spending the exact same price on such a huge quality difference. I bought both during the Christmas sales, so that is probably why I got such a good deal on the 800 count. I honestly don't know if they are bad for the price. I keep my sheets for a long time and have no idea what is realistic these days for 450 sateen. All I know, is that I was comparing apples to apples price wise, and they were night and day different. What it boils down to, is if you can get 800 sateen for anything close to what you pay for a 450 sateen, you should get it because there is definitely a difference. I do not know how they fit, because they did not make it that far!",

                "reviewText": "I wanted 100% cotton sheets, and found these and thought the price was good and figured what they hey lets give them a try. I just got them home, washed them and put them on the bed. The fitted sheet fit perfectly, even with a bit of room for shrinkage if that happens with future washings. The elastic seems like a good quality so I expect these sheets to last for quite some time. The flat sheet was again plenty big enough and hopefully it will not shrink over time either. The color (I went with Estate Blue) is gorgeous. The quality of these sheets is what I was hoping for but wasn't holding my breathe. I am very happy and plan to buy another set, this time I will go with black because I have always wanted black sheets. Anyways, I do wish there was more darker or patterns to choose from. I do not do white sheets and am tired of light colored sheets, there is just no drama to them.",
