                "reviewText": "Minibee Women's Baggy Linen Wide Leg Trousers Casual Patchwork Elastic Waist Harem Pants are very lightweight, made of 55% linen & 45% cotton but in the green color, they are NOT see-through. The material and the loose-cuffed, wide-legged style and loose fit are quite suitable for the hot summer months. The elastic waist comfortably adjusts to accommodate my usual fluctuating (by a couple inches) waist size. The cute pockets add design interest and a splash of color.These pants are well made and the seams are properly stitched. However, to prevent shrinkage and fraying, these pants (as with my clothing of similar material and style) will be hand-washed in cold water and allowed to air dry as instructed on the web site and per clothing tag, (- NOT machine washed, tumbled dried)For size reference: I am 5'4\" and weigh 132 lbs. I typically wear size 6 pants and jeans; my waist is not well defined and measures (fluctuating) 29 1/2 - 32\" and my hips are 39\". I chose size large which fits as expected with a comfortably loose, somewhat baggy (but NOT sloppy) fit. The leg cuffs are about 1 1/2\" above my ankle.These pants would be more flattering if I were a bit taller, but they do look nice and are very presentable, - enough so, to be easily worn in public while running errands, as well as worn working and lounging at home during the summer for which intentionally purchased.I am happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I only gave four instead of five stars because it's a little bit snug in the waist, but not enough to be uncomfortable. The elastic in the waistband is a wide enough to be comfy. I am 57 years old and fit, and these fit perfectly in a size XL \u2013 A nice amount of bagginess, and come down just about to the top of my ankle. The cotton is certainly soft enough for this price range. I would highly recommend.",

Whether you're tall or short, they'll look good either way. I'm also on the chunkier side and these do not roll or make me look like a stuffed sausage. I am definitely going to get these in another color. Pockets are decent. I have a Samsung S23+ and it fits perfectly in the pockets without falling out. I do wish these had back pockets but it's not a deal breaker for me.",
