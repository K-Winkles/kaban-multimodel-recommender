                "reviewText": "I purchased this outfit to wear to my daughters college graduation because I wanted a lightweight material as the ceremony was held outside in the summer heat due to Covid. As I was putting the pants on that morning, the metal clamp for adjustable waist straps broke, I tried to fix it but I was unable to so I had to use a safety pin to hold the pants together along with tightening my belt to ensure the waistline stayed intact. Then, later in the day I noticed that there was a rip inside the right pocket so I had make sure I didn't use that pocket. The outfit looks great but it seems the workmanship and/or materials are subpar. Although the outfit looks nice, I was only able to use it once.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Listen, this set did what it was supposed to do! Specs: Age:37, 6'1, 255lbs, holds weight in stomach, average thighs for his weight. He's sturdy!He wears a 38 in suit bottoms, 38 in slim fit jeans (old navy/Levi) XL bottoms in casual cotton shorts. He's an XL tee (fitted) but could comfortably fit a 2X. With that said, I ordered the 3X and it fit perfect. He had the tailored look yet room in thighs/crotch area. Vest fit great and it has the adjusting strap in the back to tighten if necessary. The pants are long, we used some hem tape and took in about 3.5 inches after measuring his inseam.Got the beige color which is natural linen so it's very neutral. Material was lightweight but sturdy, if it's ripping on ppl they probably chose the wrong size. We went to a wedding where all white was requested and he still blended seamlessly in this color. He got so many compliments on how sharp he looked and he danced all night. Great staple set to have in your wardrobe.",
