They are lightweight and breathable which makes them perfect for warm climates. The included pics are straight from the package. Once I steamed them, the wrinkles were history and didn\u2019t return. I ordered coffee and love the color. It is a great alternative to black - still neutral and match with any color. I am a petite frame and although the length is longer on me than the model, the pants still look great. I can wear them with a wedge heel for dressier looks or flats/sneakers for casual looks and either way is fantastic. I ordered a medium and they are true to size. If you don\u2019t like wearing shorts, these flowy pants will keep you cool even in the hottest weather. I originally ordered them for vacation, but they have worked their way into my office wardrobe. These pants are super versatile for year round wear and I am so glad I gave them a try.",

                "reviewText": "Living in Florida I really wanted some casual throw on pants like this as I don't always want to live in shorts or leggings so these seemed perfect and they are! I am on the shorter side, being 5'3 so sometimes I feel like they are channeling my inner coastal grandma- but huneh!!! These are so comfortable and I could careless how I look in them! Has a nice stretchy waistband and wide leg. I'm pear shaped so hips are big for me and pants can be hard to find, but these fit so perfectly and actually seemed to flatter in my opinion. They aren't see through thin but thin enough to get a good air flow and keep you cool in the warmer months. Love the variety of colors so I'm definitely looking into more. I almost want to say you could possibly size down, but they may be a little snug if you do so. I would recommend these- especially if you live near a coast or visit often these are perfect to throw over a swimsuit when it isn't exactly blazing hot. Perfect!",

                "reviewText": "I got these capris pants so that I'd have some casual summer capris in a fun color.SIZE/FIT: I got an XXL in the olive green, and they fit as expected (the waist is a little snug on me, but I knew that going in, since I have a 42\" waist - but they're pretty comfortable and stretchy regardless). I'm 5\"6', about 220 lbs. The capris pant stops about 5-6 inches above my ankle.APPEARANCE: I love the color of the fabric; it's a lovely, light, slightly muted green. I like how the capris look from the front and sides. On the backside, however, the fabric kept getting caught up on my behind, giving my a slight wedgie appearance. For that reason, I took off a star.FEATURES: These pants have nice sized, open pockets, big enough for a phone or wallet. I like the wide, elastic waist.FUNCTION/FABRIC: The fabric of these pants is light and kind of crinkled; they would be great for the beach or on a hot summer day.Overall, I'm very happy with these pants, aside from the wedgie issue.",

                "reviewText": "I was nervous about these for two reasons: I thought they would look too dowdy/matronly on me, and that they wouldn\u2019t have good stretch. I was wrong on both counts! With the right styling, I think these pants will look really chic. The fabric is super nice - a light linen quality, but with a decent amount of stretch to offer so much comfort. They do appear to wrinkle easily, but the fabric is light enough that wrinkles should easily come out with a quick steam.I typically wear size 14/16 in pants and got an XL in these and it fits great - I am more \u201cpear shaped\u201d so I can have a hard time finding things that fit my curves, but these pants passed the test! Highly recommend!",

There is no stretch to the fabric, but the loose fit allows for a comfortable wear without feeling constrained or the pants riding up. The waist, however, is a bit elastic, so even when sitting down, the pants aren\u2019t tight.Love them so far!",
