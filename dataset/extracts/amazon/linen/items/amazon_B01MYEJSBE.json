I have a long sleever, maxi length waffle robe that I wear for a half hour or so after my shower, until I'm dry enough to get dressed. I also travel a lot, and the robe I use takes up a lot of space in my suitcase. In an attempt to keep my robe habit in tact when traveling, I bought this smaller version.I'm 5'10\", so this robe is a bit short on me. Standing is fine - sitting or bending is not pretty. But it will do the trick, and keep me from struggling to wrap myself in a hotel towel.The robe itself is soft and comfortable, and wraps all the way around me. It will take up much less space when traveling, while still offering the same benefit of keeping me covered before getting dressed. I am very happy with this purchase, and just wish I had thought of it sooner.",

                "reviewText": "- there are two sets of loops for the belt, one higher than the other. This allows for people who are shorter to still have a robe which can be held closed at the correct part of the body.-Two pockets! Very difficult to find a robe with pockets. These are sturdy, not just decorative. It holds the weight of my phone.When I\u2019m sick they are convenient for holding Kleenex, chapstick, etc.-Useful enough that I keep two - one for home; one for travel-stain resistant - at least to chocolate ice cream & chocolate fudge. I\u2019ve had to wash those off multiple times.",
