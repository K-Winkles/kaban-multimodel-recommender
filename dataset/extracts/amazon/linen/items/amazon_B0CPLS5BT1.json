                "reviewText": "I made sure to check out the size chart on this shirt before purchasing because I wanted my shirt to be a bit loose-fitting for warm vacations and summer weather. As a result, I chose the 3x, based on the shoulder measurements (I have broad shoulders), and am really glad I did. The shirt fits great and is very comfortable. The cotton fabric is very soft but still feels rugged, and the style of the shirt is a bit unique with the covered buttons. Laundering is simple; wash on cold, hang to dry. You may choose to iron it for a more crisp look, but I actually prefer the look from a simple line dry. It looks casual and feels casual, but slightly different. I will be trying this one is a few more colors, I think.",

                "reviewText": "This shirt may appear as nothing exceptional. What it is, however, is a great example of taking a basic concept, and making it feel quality without all the added costs associated with manual stitching. The principal features of this shirt would be the fabric texture and the fabric that sits over the buttons. These do a great job of creating a unique looking shirt. The fabric is a nice light feel without feeling overly stretchy. This is a great shirt to wear anytime even on a hot day. Typically, a shirt with the button cover design might push the cost into a range that would be from a designer rack. This shirt falls into a nice price range that you wouldn't feel obligated to only wear it for special occasions. Win /Win for cost, design and comfort.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this shirt. It is a light weight linen material and has a rich green color and a nice feel. I would imagine it will be very comfortable on a hot summer day. It is very stylish and I especially like the solid placket with hidden buttons. I also like that, even though this is a 3XL, the sleeves are not too long (staying above my elbow). That said, I usually wear a 2XL, and I couldn't take it any tighter through the mid section, even though this shirt is a 3XL. So you may want to consider that if you don't have a slim physique. I will be very careful how I wash this shirt to (hopefully) avoid shrinking. Overall, I really like this shirt.",

Makes my belly look bigger than it actually is, and the back seems to billow outwards at the same time. The combination of this makes me look kinda round, lol.Not for me.",

Not an uncomfortable tug, but noticeable.I like the fabric, it is cool and is soft to the touch. The shirt looks like dress-up but feels more like casual.The only odd thing, which my Chinese wife said is typical in China, is that the buttons on the front, once buttoned up, are hidden behind cloth. On every button-up shirt I have ever worn previously, the buttons show through the button holes once the shirt is buttoned up. In this case, the buttons and the buttonholes are hidden behind a flap of shirt material. Actually, kind of classy and a nicer overall look, I think.The material is not heavy duty, like a full cotton shirt it, but I think this will hold up for plenty of washing cycles.This one is a new style product, and I think it's a keeper.",

Most of my Aloha Shirts are made of rayon, and it appears that this shirt has a form of rayon with other textiles. This will require line drying, unless you want the shirt to shrink and look terrible. It feels great!I knocked a star off, there was a chemical odor when I got the shirt out of the bag, but I'm sure they had their reasons, probably to prevent pests or mold?",
