                "reviewText": "This fabric is astonishing, feels soooo good and the dress appears to be well made. HOWEVER, the ties are in strange places in the front. There is a lower set of ties that is miles long at the bottom of the v-neck that doesn't do anything to close up the V. Then there is one more set of ties at the top of the v-neck that only hold the top together. But the space in between has nothing to keep it together! Each set of ties is so very, very long that I'm considering cutting them in half and sewing them to the continuing sides of the v-neck to finish closing it up, because it's wide open. You couldn't possibly wear it without adjusting something because everything would hang out! But the fabric is gorgeous!",

                "reviewText": "I absolutely love this style of dress for my church gatherings! I am 5' 6\" tall, 155 lbs, 38 bust, medium build and 68. During the days I'm working the ranch in jeans and hat, tossing bales of hay and scrubbing out rabbit pans. Sunday is the only day of the week that I can be a lady in appearance and behavior. I am an incredibly picky person when it comes to dresses and femininity. When I dress up, I have to sparkle and shine. The rest of the week I can be a pig. So there are very few dresses or styles that appeal to me. Many are way too 'youthful' in appearance for my age. I'm a very country farming individual, and live in the AZ desert, so I like wearing things that cover the knees, the arms, and the breasts! As a Christian that is a must. I'm not big on frills either. Simple, western, even exotically Mexican fits my needs and this design does it. I don't care for tight fitting outfits. Loose is best. And this dress design provides all of what I desire without overdoing the fancy perks to keep it both casual and for special occasions. I wear this with some really cute stone-colored knee high lacy leather boots and my husband adores the overall outcome. The upper panels on this dress give it a nice bodice and definition, and to prevent any 'cleavage' from being exposed (my dirty pillows) I tie the bottom tassles very tightly and add a safety pin to close up the gap. It is an over-the-head dress, so I do my hair after I put the dress on, otherwise I'll have a bedhead appearance. The pattern is absolutely adorable, yet not too childish or immature, so I pull it off nicely. My husband adores this style on me, and says it makes him feel like a kid again. The bottom flows so beautifully and there is no sheerness. I spray and toss the dress into the dryer to remove all wrinkles. The material is very light and wafts prettily around my knees. It is country all the way with a fling of dressy. It can be worn with or without a hat, but not my working hat, so I'll be seeking out future hats that are more church appropriate. The design looks like it was made for me, brassy yet subtle and the pastels are amazing. Colors are true to the display, and I opt for an XXL. Not because I'm a 16-18 figure (I'm truly only a medium to large figure with 38 bust) but because I like the fuller skirting and the ease of extra to pull it over my head and not struggle. The sleeves have elastic wrists and can be pulled up for a different style. I so fell in love with this design and loose flow that I have purchased 5 versions already and will likely purchase more. They do have other button down dresses similar in patterns that I might also consider. Well made, beautiful colors, and if you're a blonde like me, the sky is the limit on choices. Highly recommend for older women!!!",

                "reviewText": "This dress is unlike the clothes I usually wear. I have a thick waist and have been looking for an easy dress that will accomodate my waist. This is it! The dress hangs nicely, and my waist is hidden! I purchased the dress for summer because of the light-weight fabric, but have worn it recently (it's winter here) and it was still very comfortable. After wearing this dress a couple of times, I purchased another dress in another color.One thing that I did change, was that I sewed the neckline slit up to the first tassle. It was an easy thing to do and I feel more comfortable.",

Sleeves are just the right length for international travel (covering upper arms and shoulders), yet the drawstring v-neckline is great for warm weather/cooling. Due to fabric content, wrinkles badly when packed, but steams out easily.",

                "reviewText": "Read many reviews before buying. First bought \"multicolor blue\" which is more purple/blue to me but still very nice. I'm 5'7\" 138lbs & purchased small as did not want to feel like I was wearing a tent. It's a great fit, but as others have mentioned a little snug across the chest. For me the snugness was across the armpit area rather than boobs - though I do not have big boobs, so I would size up if you're well endowed. I bought a 2nd in beige (for fall) - same fit. Washed both before wearing by hand in cold water and no shrinking. Hung to dry and was very surprised that creases could be released by shaking and pulling a little while still damp. (Wash instructions are on label, mine are both 55% rayon/45% cotton). They looked great after ironing. Very pleased with purchases, just wish it was possible to zoom in to get better look at the patterns on the dresses before taking the plunge.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this a size up because my 1st dress in this style shrank a bit, still wearable but I dislike fitted clothes. I will probably order another color - that's how much I like this style. I just throw it on (I do have to pin closure some for my comfort) and I wear it everywhere as well as super comfy housedress. I'm 5'2 so the dress hangs almost mid-calf on me but that's not a bad thing. It is not a winter dress! Lightweight without being cheap looking. I machine wash and hang dry, and ready to wear again. I think this addresses what I wondered about. Oh, my fuller chested daughters would want a permanent closure on the opening but that's an easy fix and very subjective.",
