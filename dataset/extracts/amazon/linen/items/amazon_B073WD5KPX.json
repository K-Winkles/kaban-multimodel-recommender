We recommend to wash it in gentle machine cycle on 85\u00b0F with similar colors. Tumble dry at low heat. Ironing on 230\u00b0F. Do not dry clean. Do not use detergent that contains bleach or whitener. I find linen pills after wash it. How do i remedy this problem? It's normal to see some lint in the first few washes since it's 100% from natural flax linen.",

And who cares If there are wrinkles in your sheets. The bottom sheet has elastic all the way around so they do not slip off. They will fit deeper mattresses. Love love love them.

                "reviewText": "Update 2022: I've had these sheets for close to 2 years now and still love them!-----I live in Arizona and we've had a heat wave for weeks now. My old cotton sheets were smothering to lay on, even without a top sheet - every point where my body came into contact with the bed would become hot and sweaty. I woke up most mornings to gross, damp sheets; kinda felt like sleeping in a swamp.Linen is supposed to be more breathable and ideal for both hot climates and hot sleepers. I'm on a tight budget and the prospect of paying close to $300 for a basic set of linen sheets was unacceptable, given that I've never so much as touched linen before and had no idea if I would like it. I was also kind of desperate to try anything that might make sleeping at night more bearable, so $130 seemed like a good compromise. I did a ton of reading before I bit the bullet and decided that if linen really is so comfortable and does last 5-10 years, or even 20-30 like some people claim, it was worth a try.The price on these is just right. The stitching is admittedly not the best quality, but after just one night using these sheets I know I love linen. No hotspots between me and the bed, no sweat-bogs in the morning, no waking up in the middle of the night to chug water because I sweated myself dry. I got the natural linen color and I love the textural look and feel of them.The texture is actually not as rough as I'd expected, although I certainly wouldn't call it soft. It's very pleasant to sleep on, however - I love the way the linen drapes over me rather than clings, and the way it catches the air when you toss it over the bed. People have different preferences for texture so linen may not be to everyone's taste, but it is to mine. I will probably branch out at some point and try other brands, but I'm very glad I tried this brand first. It's definitely a huge improvement over my old sheets and a great value.----------A few brief points to make:1. I've never tried any other brand of linen, so I can't speak to the quality compared to others.2. I can say that compared to cotton, these sheets are a godsend. They didn't just absorb sweat better than cotton, I actually sweated less. They feel cool to the touch when I crawl into bed in the evening, and stay that way.3. Although the stitching is not the best I've seen, it's not bad, either. These sheets are worth it if you live in a hot climate or would like to try linen for any other reason. The pockets seem huge and I wasn't sure they would fit properly on my bed, but the elastic is generous enough that it cinched all the extra fabric neatly under the mattress - no chance that the corners will pop off while I sleep. The pillowcases do have an envelope closure.4. I've read some reviews about a bad odor when you first open the package; mine were fine and went directly on the bed.5. I've also read reviews about holes developing in the fabric too soon; I can't speak to that yet, but I'll update later as these sheets age.I will say that linen is said to be more durable than cotton overall, but not as elastic; if you use high heat or crease your sheets too much (throwing them into the dryer in a tangled wad, folding them too tightly in storage, etc) the creases are prone to giving out because the fibers break. I don't know if that has any relevance, but it's good to know for general care. I've also read that fabric softener stiffens the fabric as well as making it less breathable and absorbent; that may also be a factor. If these sheets develop holes even without excessive creasing and fabric softener, I'll make a note of it as that would be a serious quality issue.Long review, but I'm kind of astounded by how well linen sheets breathe. It may actually be a life-changer if I sleep this well every night.",

In fact, I'd say they are in the third string of most comfortable sheets I own. Tiny flax nubs stick out like rough paper edges. At night I am often woken up just because of the texture of the sheets. They aren't horribly uncomfortable, just mildly irritating. I have no doubt that the ad copy is correct, and these will soften with time. I'm just saying, I have three other linen bedclothes purchased around the same time, such as a Levtex duvet cover, and they're all notably softer. Most nights I kick off this DAPU bedsheet and just sleep beneath the Levtex duvet cover. That gives me less temperature control than I'd like but that's how it goes. I'm thinking about washing these sheets five times in a row and see if it helps.",
