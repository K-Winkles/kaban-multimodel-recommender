I have a shorter torso and longer legs for my build. I was comfortable with where the waist fell, it cinched just enough to show what waist I have left, and the length fit me well.The brown is similar to a mid-to-light colored cocoa powder with more reddish undertones. Can be paired with a sweater or jacket easily, and either dressed up with heels/nice sandals or down with tennies if you wanted.I'll be ordering another in a different color for sure!",

                "reviewText": "Well I ordered this jumper on a whim because they really look so nice on and are majorly comfortable. It came quickly and really is a nice. It will be perfect for a warm spring or summer day. It is light and airy. It is perfectly casual but would go well at church or a community function. I gave less than five stars for the flattery rating because although it looks nice it isn't perfect. I am only five foot tall and about 130. I bought a medium. It fits well but the legs are very long and a little too flowy for my taste. The neckline is very flattering and unlike most linen it does have some stretch because the way the back is designed. The back makes it much more comfortable but if you wear a traditional bra it accentuates the outline of your underclothes. Its the style to wear an undershirt but one of the newer style bralettes might go well. One thing to note is that it says online that it cannot be washed and that it is dry clean only but the actual item tag states it is washable in cold water with tumble dry low. I washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. I will likely iron it inside out just to make it look nicer. The biggest selling point here is that this jumper is insanely comfortable and can really look chic.",

This jumpsuit goes down to my ankles and not any longer with a waistband that sits just below my boobs (granted, they are on the large side here), so I don't know how well it would fit my tall friends. I feel like it is incredibly flattering on me, accentuating my assets, and draping over everything really nicely. The back is smocked or ruched so that it custom fits to your body perfectly. There are only two minor problems for me. One is that the neck v-notch is not sewn evenly and my eye is immediately drawn to it. Not sure if anyone else would notice it though. The second problem is that I had a lot of trouble finding a bra that I already owned that didn't poke out the arm holes. Eventually I found one that works, but it was not easy. Again this might be less of an issue for smaller-busted gals. And the last thing to note- not a problem, but something you should be aware of- this is 30% linen, 70% rayon so it does wrinkle.I love it!",

The back of this is all elastic which is genius! If you are large breasted, you have room. Entire back to the waist is elastic and ruched.The back is closed by a small button. It was so easy to put this on.The bottom pants is flowy wide legged and very flattering. Wear with sandals, heels or white pair of sneakers.The sides has 2 deep pockets. I love that!I look for clothes that have style and easy to wash in washer and dryer. I don't have time for dry cleaning or ironing. This fits my bill. Affordable and I don't sacrifice any comfort or style.The fabric is semi heavy. Not thin nor thick.It is winter but I could wear this under a blazer and wear a thin thermal pants underneath in the office.Truly a versatile piece for any season.I want this in navy blue next!I rate this and the seller 5 out of 5 stars!",

                "reviewText": "Jumpsuits are a gamble for me fit-wise, particularly if they don't have a zipper in the back. I've got wide hips and a narrow waist, and being able to slide the top half over my hips is always a 50/50 shot. In this case, the gamble paid off.The entire back is elasticized and stretchy, so it's possible to slither this over wide hips and still have a garment that is fitted & flattering. Another reviewer said this was NOT a good option if you have hips because the entire neckline is piped, which limits the stretch. This is true to some extent, but if you're careful putting it on, I think most wide-hipped women can make it work. I included a photo so if you're curvy you have a reference.Overall, the fabric is a nice medium weight, and breathable. The piece has a nice drape that's very flattering, and the style of this can go easily from casual to a bit dressier. Very happy with this.",
