                "reviewText": "I love this dress! I'm 5'8 and 180ish lbs, I sized down based on the other reviews so I ordered a medium instead of my regular large. It was still very roomy so I gave those to my sister and ordered a small. The small is a better fit (still roomy) but tighter in the chest and arms. It's not so tight that it's uncomfortable but just be mindful if you don't like anything snug up top because there's no stretch. I love the natural cotton/linen blend. I washed both dresses before wearing in cold/cold on delicate cycle and dried on low/ delicate with no shrinkage. They don't really need to be ironed because they look better in their natural state (if you wear linen you know what I mean). I bought the natural/tan and black. They aren't see through at all. They hit just slightly below my knees in front, slightly longer in back. This dress is not for everyone. It's only for truly confident women who know how to wear unique styles. The pockets are fabulous!! Not your run of the mill on seam pockets, these pockets are super convenient for keys, readers, cell phone.. anything in your hand you don't want to lay down (and forget where you put it \ud83d\ude02) I have gotten many compliments on this dress and it's easy to wear. It can be thrown on for running errands or an appointment. It's super versatile and easily transforms from casual to dressy (with great jewelry and shoes). Get this dress!",

Minibee's quality control and the finish isn't perfect, and I haven't washed it yet (fingers crossed) so I can't comment on the shrinkage. I plan to wash it in a delicates bag on gentle cycle and air dry it, but the material may not be able to withstand it.",

I'm tall and fat and was worried it would be awkward with my proportions but it looks great and is super comfortable. Perfect lounge dress with leggings.Some reviews noted poor construction and itchy fabric but I didnt find that the case. I sew and found the construction perfectly fine. And the fabric feels like a cotton/linen blend would. It actually feels a bit more like pure linen. But all natural fibers makes it a win for me.For size reference: I'm 5'10\" and measurements are 52/45/60. I bought a 3x and it's still roomy and loose and has space for my shoulders, which are often too tight. Length hits me at the bottom of the knee.",

A lot of the dye washed out but it didn't seem to affect the color. So - don't wash it in your washing machine with clothes that you don't want to be blue. The cut is very \"apple\" shaped.
