                "reviewText": "Dress is nice. I like the fabric more than I expected. This color isn't see thru. It's a dress you could dress up or down.Problem is, the sleeves are very long. They have a strip of material inside with a button slot clearly meant to use for rolling the sleeve up to 3/4 length. Plus on the sleeve there is a small reinforced square patch made for a button. Here is the problem, There's NO button!I know I could go to the store and maybe find the right size button and right color thread. I am just not happy that I have to do this right before I am needing the dress to wear.",

                "reviewText": "I really like this dress. The problem is it is tight around the breast and hip area. For reference, I am 5'3\" and 175 lbs. I might have been able to get away with the fit, but because it is so see-through, I would have to wear a slip. The extra layer underneath would make it impossible to walk in. It is a nice dress, just not suited for thicker women.",
