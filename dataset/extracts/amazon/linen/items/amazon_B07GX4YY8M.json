I was hoping for a light weight but not flimsy robe to use in the summer months and this fit the bill. It is comfortable to wear & fits well. I was a little nervous about washing it after reading some of the reviews but it washed & dried without any problem. I am so glad I decided to try this robe. I've been looking to replace an older robe for a long time but could not find anything that made me happy. They were either too heavy or too flimsy or too short or too long. I'm very happy with this purchase!",

I love that it keeps me warm even in the cold of January in a northern state. I love being \"short\" because it hangs almost to my ankles. I love the purple color. I love that it washes and dries nicely. I HATE that the tie is too short. I bought an XXL size. The size is fine. But there is hardly enough tie to tie it. I can tie it once, like the model in the ad. Look how long her tie is. But to tie it once does not keep it closed. And there is hardly any tie left to tie it again. You would think a larger size would have a longer tie. I'm returning mine. What good is it if you can't tie your robe closed???",

                "reviewText": "I probably tried 4 or 5 different robes before finding this one. The length is great; it falls nicely and stays together with ties without even having inside ties. The \u201cwaffle fabric is just right for weight. Warm enough but not too warm. Also washes very well. Highly recommend. Should probably get another but it\u2019s not showing any sign of wear!!",
