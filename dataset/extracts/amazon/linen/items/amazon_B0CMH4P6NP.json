                "reviewText": "I am a big fan of Coofandy and have almost a dozen of their shirts. They are always comfortable, well made and fit well. The Casual Henley is no exception.This is my first Henley style shirt and I have mixed feelings. Not because of the quality but more for the design. As with all my other Coofandy pieces, the quality is top notch. The stitching is tight, there are no loose threads and the material is very soft and moves well while wearing it. The collar is different, but it is comfortable but I had to keep the top two buttons open for it would rub my neck when I was working at the computer.The sleeves have a button on the outside and an inner strap. You will roll them up three times to button them in place. I wore this to work and, with the sleeves pinned up, they were a bit shorter then I like. I am tattooed but they all end just above normal short sleeve length. This shirt was just a bit too short and they were visible. Not a problem when wearing casually, but not corporate casual enough for me (will not be an issue for most people though so not dinging them any stars). The bottom cuff isn't flexible so, when taking the shirt off it is a bit tight. The fit is spot on. I wear a large in most shirts and the large on this fit me perfectly.For me, the quality is fantastic, but the design isn't my style. No fault of the company though so, based on the quality giving this a 4 star rating.",

                "reviewText": "Let's be honest: the COOFANDY Men's Casual Henley Shirt promises a cool, breezy linen look for summer, but the reality falls far short. Buckle up because this review isn't going to be pretty.Cons:Paper-Thin \"Linen\": This fabric is so sheer and flimsy it might as well be a glorified tissue. Forget any semblance of structure or quality \u2013 it feels like it could rip with a strong breeze. Where's the promised linen texture and durability?Collar Catastrophe: The band collar? It's more like a priest's nightmare. It's stiff, uncomfortable, and looks ultimately out of place on this flimsy shirt. It's like they glued on a formal collar to a casual t-shirt and called it a day.Stylish Sinkhole: Don't be fooled by the pictures. This shirt clings and reveals every imperfection, offering zero opacity. Unless you're comfortable with a see-through look, steer clear!Quality Conundrum: The stitching is questionable at best, and the overall construction feels cheap and mass-produced. This shirt won't survive many washes or wears before falling apart.Pros:...crickets...Overall:This COOFANDY Henley is a fashion faux pas waiting to happen. The fabric is embarrassingly thin, the collar is an unwelcome guest, and the quality is about as good as a tissue paper tent. Avoid this disappointment and invest in a linen shirt that actually deserves the name.Recommendation:Do yourself a favor and skip this flimsy excuse for a linen shirt. Look for brands known for using quality fabrics and construction. Remember, true linen offers breathability, structure, and durability \u2013 none of which you'll find here. Don't settle for cheap imitations \u2013 your style deserves better!",

I have bought other great products from this brand, but this particular one was definitely not it for me. If you are into the baggy and loose look, then this should be fine. The material itself was OK, but this is not a piece of clothing that I plan on wearing, I\u2019m going to donate it to my local Goodwill.",

                "reviewText": "This shirt is very different than the other shirts I own. It is a little bit nicer than a t-shirt, but not as formal as a shirt with a traditional collar. The short collar on this reminds me of a shirt I picked up in Cambodia years ago - so a bit of Asian styling. The polyester-rayon is very comfortable and gives a little bit of flex. I am a big guy: 6'/220 lb. and the XL fits perfectly. It isn't tight like some \"slim\" style shirts but it isn't overly baggy either. It is definitely a shirt to wear untucked and it will go nice with shorts. It is winter here now, so I can't speak to how cool it will be in the heat, but it seems pretty breathable. The rollup sleeves with the button strap to keep them in place is interesting. For me, the sleeves are just too short to look good when rolled up, but just a bit too long when all the way down. That being said, I will probably leave them down most of the time but maybe try them rolled up in the heat.",

This shirt, so well-made, will definitely get him on the road to relaxation.We got the XL Beige and it is stunning. I think he'll look great on those port days seeing sights -- and stay cool in this shirt.I should add that he can have textile issues, so it is so important for me to pick the right fabrics for my husband. This shirt is excellent for that need. It is soft, smooth, and cool to the touch -- all things he requires.The material and stitching are of very high quality and I'm sure this shirt will last for years to come. My husband is an XL, and while the shirt fits well, any smaller and it would be too tight for him. If in doubt, I would say order a size bigger. Even with that, I still rate this shirt five stars.",
