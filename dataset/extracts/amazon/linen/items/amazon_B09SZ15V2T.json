I\u2019m about 200 pounds and bought an XL which is my typical size in bottoms. They are not tight fitting, but I still have great shape in them while being comfy!

I usually wear jeans, but there are days when I\u2019m just cleaning or painting and I wanted something more comfortable. These are awesome. Deep pockets, thick high waistband, the fabric is like doubled up to make them durable but still very soft and flexible. I have them in two colors, might get another. The only tip I\u2019d give is to hang dry. I\u2019m adored they might shrink if I throw them in the dryer but so far hang dry works perfectly.",

They have pockets that barely work cause if you walk with your phone in it and take a big step it\u2019ll just fall right out like how your man fell out of your life. They are soft I give them that. But the waist is sooo tight if your have a body. I like to wear mine high and I can\u2019t do that. They shrunk. I am 5 \u2018 7 althletic legs for days cute af and 130 pounds. I got some in the trunk cause I be glutting it up I have hips and a small waist (26) So if you are shaped like a cheese stick this is for you! If you are short get them! Any girl 5\u20195 and under would probably like these unless you packin hard in the back or you got some meat on your stomach. I would size UP. I GOT A MEDIUM and they are too small. I would get a large and maybe I would\u2019ve been more happy.",
