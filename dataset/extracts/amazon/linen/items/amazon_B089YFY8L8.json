These pants are slimmer fitting and the tapered (elastic in the back of the bottom of the legs) creates a lovely shape. Also, they are SO comfortable that I wish I could wear them every day. The material is excellent and the fit is fantastic. I usually take an XL but I purchased these in a large and they fit perfectly.",

They are on the thin side but not enough to make them unwearable. As a \"vertically challenged \" person I feel like wide leg pants make me look dumpy so I like that these are not wide leg. The fabric and stitching seems sturdy enough that I expect them to last a while. Overall I'm pleased.",

I have a flatter butt and narrower hips for a woman. Dry clean or cold water delicate only. I haven't washed them yet so we shall see about shrinkage. At $26.88 they are an ok value. I am buying another pair as I rarely can find summer pants that aren't too long. If you are average height or tall, they may be too short.",

                "reviewText": "So I actually bought this pair as well as a similar listing that was 100% linen and cost more. I decided to keep this one mostly for the length and the color (the other I ordered in a white/beige that looked too \"mom on a hike\" for me). I'm 5'2 and the length hits just on the upper ankle. Since it's a blend, the fabric is also quite soft straight off and more wrinkle resistant than 100% linen. I was worried about breathability but I wore them in 95 degree heat in Italy and it was fine. The elastic in the back and high waistband also makes it quite comfortable. It's also quite fitted so the shape is flattering for the most part. I opted for a jogger style over wide leg style since I don't like it when the pant legs touch the floor when using the bathroom. One con I would mention is that they do feel cheaper than the linen pair I got. The construction is not as good, but I guess expected for the price. The butt pockets are also fake. They also smelled kind of funny and felt kind of dirty when I received them (might have been a return? Or mah e factory dust...), but was fine after a wash.",
