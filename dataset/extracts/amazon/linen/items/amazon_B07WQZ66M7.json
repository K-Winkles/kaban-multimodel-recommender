The fabric has a lovely hand and was a heavier weight than I expected, which is great because I live where it gets really cold in the winter. Since it's linen, I expect some wrinkling and that doesn't bother me. The seams are stitched and surged (finished), and the hem is enclosed. So...at least for now, better fabric, fit, and construction than I expected and that makes me happy!",
