Drawstring waist is forgiving of those lockdown pounds and they. have. POCKETS! I am 5\u20196 so they are also a great fit in length, and I think these will work well as transitional wear as I work to drop some of those aforementioned lockdown pounds but if I decide to just be MORE, I will have the pants for the new MORE me.

                "reviewText": "I deducted one star as they are a little big in the waist even with the drawstring. I got them on a deal and will probably wear a t-shirt or light weight sweater which will cover the waistline up. Nice quality but if I'd paid full price I probably would have returned them fir a smaller size. I never understand why you can't exchange for a different size. Overall a great purchase they are soft and summery which is what I was looking for. For reference I'm 5'1 127 lbs and I ordered my normal size medium. I probably could have gotten a size small. They just fit length wise so definitely not for a tall person.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for the GAP Women's Easy Pant (Size: Small, Color: Khaki). I received a free taxable sample of these pants to review in my search for a pair of women's beach pants that could be worn at the beach or around the pool.The pants weigh 306 grams and have an approximately 15\" elastic drawstring waist and measure 19\" at the hips. The pants are an ankle cut with an approximate length of 34\" and an inseam of 24 1/2\". The legs taper from 9\" around the knees to a leg opening of 7\". There are six pockets with the pants: two deep pockets in the front, two in the back, and two pockets with flaps (no buttons) slightly above the knees.The pants are made of a see-through 55% linen + 45% rayon/viscose material. The overall feel of the fabric is smooth yet slightly scratchy with minimal stretch except at the waist. As noted in the care instructions, the pants can be machined wash cold with a non-chlorine bleach and then tumble dried on low with a cool iron as needed. The linen material makes this a fairly high-maintenance piece of clothing that comes out of the dryer needing to be ironed and re-ironed.The overall fit was relaxed and as expected for our teenager (5 ' 7\", 135lbs) who used these as beach pants over her swim bottoms at the pool and when walking around the beach. The teenager made a point to be deliberate about when to wear the pants as they are quite see-through, but was otherwise pleased with the overall look for the chosen situations.All in all, these GAP Women's Easy Pants are of good quality and fit as expected. I would recommend only considering them as an option for specific situations where see-through linen pants are the look you're going for and only if you are prepared to invest some time in ironing and maintenance.",
