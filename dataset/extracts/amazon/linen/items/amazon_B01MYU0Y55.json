                "reviewText": "The only minor quibble I have with this shirt is that it wrinkles so easily, but that is common to linen generally. It certainly isn't an issue with this shirt specifically.I often find that sizes are somewhat smaller than stated. Not a problem here. Fit is excellent. Look is great. Linen quality is great.I have 3 shirts in this particular Perry Ellis line. One slightly more important issue worth noting is that color fastness is uneven. The warm colors are not as color fast as the cooler colors. But this should not be a problem if you treat the shirt as often recommended for bright colors.",

                "reviewText": "Absolutely love the colour I\u2019ll definitely buy another one with this colour for a men\u2019s shirt very high summer tonesSo it\u2019s beautiful however it does (seem*) to shrink up a bit in the wash or dryer like a lot of clothing does and I found as I\u2019m over 6 feet 1\u201d tall that this was a bit short in the mid riff or the belt line after half a dozen washes.That might just be me because I\u2019m taller but I just noticed it.If I can offer one critique would be that I found I have to iron the shirt every time I wanna wear it because it\u2019s linen.I think it\u2019s because it\u2019s a linen shirt every time I have to iron to get all the creases/wrinkles out.",
