                "reviewText": "I got the Lined Off-White curtains, 38\"x96\" and 50\"x96\". The pictured curtains were all hung out of the package, without steaming nor ironing. I didn't measure the curtains, but they appeared to be pretty similar in lengths and widths as I hung them. They came with some wrinkles and loose threads, to be expected especially for the price. I'll likely steam/iron them at some point when I find the time, if the wrinkles don't soften up. These lined curtains let in softer light, but I feel completely private while the curtains are closed. I personally didn't like the way they looked when hung on the rod through the provided rod pockets nor using the back tabs, so I opted for using clips and rings that I grabbed from ikea. The 38\" has 5 back tabs, and the 50\" has 7 back tabs (and I used the same respective numbers of clips and rings).I had some Emery Linen privacy-lined curtains on hand and I can definitely tell the difference, e.g. no loose threads, felt more solid overall, but these curtains were soo much more affordable for the whole home while looking great as well, so I would recommend these as a budget option for a similar look.",

                "reviewText": "First, the curtains are a beautiful color. I got them in an Oatmeal color with the black out backing. I would not consider these curtains blackout at all. I bought them for my bedroom and they are pretty sheer in my opinion for a blackout curtain. The curtain material is pretty thick and decent quality. However, the sewing job on these curtains leaves a lot to be desired. There are many loose threads and the sewing is not even. I am still debating whether I will keep these curtains or not. I do like them, but overall, I am disappointed in the sewing quality because I have bought other curtains from this company in velvet and they were really good quality and sewn really well. I am not sure if I got a less than perfect patch. I bought three sets of these in the 50 x 90 size. Yet, they all seem slightly off in their measurements. Like I said, the thickness is good, the color is beautiful. They look and feel like linen, but they are not sewn as well as I would have hoped or consistently. So this is something to consider for the price point, which is not expensive, but also not inexpensive, in my opinion.",

I like my drapes to be full so on this 16\u2019 set of double French doors there are 4 pairs. In the single windows though it\u2019s just one pair because I generally leave them pulled to the outside of the window. When I do close them on occasion they don\u2019t look too sparse though. The panel width is generous enough for that even",
