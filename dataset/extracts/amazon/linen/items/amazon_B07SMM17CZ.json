                "reviewText": "I purchased this suit for a wedding my best friend was having in Cancun, and true to her nature she had it on the beach. The invitation said \"Beach Formal\", an attire description I'm still not completely clear what it means. This suit definitely fit the bill! It was light enough to breath under the hot Mexican sun, yet substantial enough to give the dressy feel I was looking for. The suit fit exactly as expected, and the material was high quality linen with a tight weave and a soft feel to it. If I had the time I would have removed the silk lining, however its a nice touch if you are not planning on wearing it on a beach during the summer. This suit was a perfect fit for the look I was hoping to be wearing for the wedding, and I am very satisfied with my purchase.",

It fits perfectly and looks like a million bucks. I have an Armani suit for which I paid $800 at Sak's Fifth Avenue. This Perry Ellis linen jacket looks just as good.",
