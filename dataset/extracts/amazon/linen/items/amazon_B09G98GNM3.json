                "reviewText": "I'm planning a Caribbean vacation and need some \"dress\" pants for evening wear. These pants were the best option, at least \"on paper.\" Based on other user reviews, it seemed like these were decent quality at a good price, so I took the plunge and ordered two pair; Natural and Black.My main concern was inseam length. I usually wear 44 (W) x 34 (L) jeans. I was somewhat concerned about the waist but greatly concerned about the length, as usually when pants are sized with \"L,\" \"XL,\" \"XXL\" they typically are tailored for men with 28 - 30 inch inseam. While I am planning on visiting a tropical island, I wasn't too happy about the thought of wearing \"high waters.\"I'm very happy to report that the XXL size of these pants fit nicely. The waist still has room in the elastic to move and sit without fear of splitting a seam. The length is pretty good for my normal 34 inch inseam, dropping just across the tops of my feet. I should have no issues (and by \"issues\" I mean mocking stares, points-and-laughs, or snickering at the length of my trousers) while wearing flip-flops. I do not think these pants are long enough on me to wear comfortably with dress shoes or any shoe with a heel. However, if your inseam is shorter then you may be able to get away with different shoe choices.The material of these pants is light and thin, which can be both good and bad.The good:I bought these for vacation on a tropical island where humidity and temps are almost always high. The material is plenty breathable, light and thin, allowing maximum airflow and wicking. I shouldn't have any issues with backside \"sweat spots\" after sitting for dinner, or if I happen to lounge in a pool-side chaise with some water spray on the surface.The bad:The Natural color pants are thin enough that I need to be cautious of what color undergarment I wear underneath. Any undergarment that's way darker or lighter than your natural flesh tone can be seen \"through\" the pant material. The same goes for garments that are brightly colored or have bold patterns. So try to avoid wearing your sparkly Superman undies with the Natural pants. Same holds true, even more so, for the White pants. Guys - Take a fashion tip from the ladies: Your undergarment should match or be close to your flesh tone, NOT the pants, when wearing thin, light or white pants. You're welcome.",

                "reviewText": "I work in an office environment that has a casual dress code. Up until getting this, I normally wore jeans to work. I hate jeans and, honestly, hate anything that requires a belt, so I started looking for something that had drawstring. I didn't even know if nice pants that used drawstrings (read: non-sweatpants) even existed. I saw these, they looked nice, and were half-off, so I had to give them a try.When I put them on, I was beyond surprised at how good they were. I'm a tall guy, so I didn't know if the inseam would be long enough, but I also didn't want to get too large a waist since my waist is pretty small considering my height. Apprently, I lucked out when I ordered the XL and the length AND waist were perfect. Had I designed the pant myself, I couldn't have made them fit better. (The sizing chart is dead on.)Not only was the fit great, though, the material far exceeded what I was expecting. It's very light, so don't expect it to work well as a wind-breaker; however, the material is very soft and incredibly comfortable. Since it does have some stretch to it, there is NO constriction, unlike jeans and many dress pants. The waist also some pull to it (elastic, I would imagine), so I don't necessarily even need the drawstring, but I use it any way just in case.Lastly, i love the look of them. I have a few pairs of dress pants I use for special occassions... and I might be ditching them for these. All right, that might be a stretch, but I could easily see myself using these as part of an overall dressed-up attire.A+ all around.",

They are very high quality and I was very happy with them. The only thing that would have made them perfect would be to have the ability to choose inseam length. At a 34\" inseam, I had to roll them up for the White party. But as they say in Jamaica, \"No problem\". I plan to have them hemmed before my next trip.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these in LARGE for my husband for out beach wedding in Jamaica! He is 6ft 4inches and about 175-180 pounds. He usually wears MEDIUM but I bought the large because I was concerned that the pants would be too short for him. However, after receiving them, the length was perfect. I slightly regret not getting the medium as the crotch area in the large seemed a little big. However, he was fine with it and looked absolutely breath taking in these white pants with a Cubavera linen blend popover shirt with embroidery detailing across the shoulders. The large pants worked very well and the draw string was great at giving him the perfect fit for his waist.All in all....great pants, very well tailored. Strong stitching and excellent finishing. It was worth every dollar!! I recommend these to every man! Strong comfortable breathable material. My husband was able to play Capoeira in these, with enough room to allow his legs to extend and move with ease.Shipping was fast, on time and had no issues! Great company!",

Seriously! For the price I could have gotten some nice well-constructed pants from Haggar and they would fit and last for years. The size I ordered is my usual size but the there must be a difference. I washed them so I can't send them back and wouldn't want to get another pair because of the poor quality and construction. I don't like to complain but when I spend about $35 on something, I want and expect it to be good quality and construction, especially from Amazon which is my primary \"store\" since I live a hundred miles from the city.",
