I washed it as per the instructions and in cold water, hung to dry and just discovered today that it shrunk, like a lot! It used to touch the top of my foot. I\u2019m about 5\u20196 for reference. It also has 3 button holes you can use to adjust the length. I originally wore it buttoned on the tightest hole and it still used to be quite long. This is now buttoned on the loosest and it still looks like I\u2019m wearing a capri version of this. To say I am very sad and very disappointed is an understatement! And I can\u2019t get a refund because I\u2019ve had this for a few months now. I guess it will only be good for a summer outfit or around the house now.",
