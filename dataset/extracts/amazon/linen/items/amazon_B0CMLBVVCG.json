I did not have to hike them up to my bra or roll the band over.They fit perfectly and the high waist and the slight flared leg opening high lights my waist and give me more shape.I was excited that these shorts were supposed to be linen rather than polyester, which seems to be most clothing here, and these are but only 30 percent. The remainder is rayon, which makes it drapier and not as prone to wrinkles.Nice hot weather staple with linen texture that won't wrinkle as much as 100 percent linen.",

                "reviewText": "The first thing I noticed when these arrived, honestly, was a strong odor - but it must have been only in the packaging. Once I removed these from the envelope and the additional inner bag I didn't notice it any longer.They fit is nice, loose, and airy with the drawstring functional and the elastic waist very stretchy.If you're inclined to wear \"dress shorts\" these would qualify (I am too old for dress shorts, but that's my personal take and preference. These would definitely work for that look.)The rayon in the blend adds a softeness to these. They drape nicely, sit nicely at the natural waist, and the small is a great fit for me. I am 5'3\", 128lbs, 29 in waist and 37 in hips.They are a slightly shorter inseam than I typically wear but with the flowing design of the legs they don't look too short.I soaked them in the sink before machine washing and didn't notice significant color loss. All of the seams are in tact - no loose strings or other signs that they may not last long.These are nice and will get a lot of rotation in my spring and summer closet. They are going to be so cute with a tee and some sandals!",

                "reviewText": "These Linen Shorts are very comfortable to wear. The material is lightweight and thin. They remind me of the beach material. They do come pretty high up on the waist and have a tie around the waist. These shorts have a pocket on each side and I would say they come down to about mid thigh or little above.They are very comfortable and sizes seem to be correct because these fit great. I got these for the summer time and it's winter right now, so I have put these away until the warm weather hits. They are very stylish and modern. Could be worn as casual or you could wear as dressy, pending on what you wear with them.Love the color and could be worn with any style top. Very comfortable and easy to clean.I can't say the price is perfect, but I guess it's about the going rate for shorts these days. Not the best and not the worst price is what I can say.HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM THOUGH. Would also make a great gift.",
