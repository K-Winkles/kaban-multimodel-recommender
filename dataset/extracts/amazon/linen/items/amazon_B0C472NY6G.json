To prevent such problem, we have made it 1.5 inch longer to make sure it fits like regular size after the first wash. In the review, it was mentioned that the sizing was off? The hip measurement was wrong for the first few days these pants were released. We've thoroughly checked and updated the size chart. Please rest assured that it's correct now.",

I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d, 173 lbs and they fit perfectly. Love the pockets, too. Not sure why they refer to them as beach pants. I live in Southern California where currently it\u2019s maybe 70-75 F during the day and mid 40\u2019s at night until mid-spring. They\u2019re great for this weather but I would never wear them in the summer here (80 -110 F).",
