                "reviewText": "Buy it!This is an item that stands out to me - it\u2019s tough to find quality clothing on Amazon, it\u2019s always a risk. This exceeded my expectations, I think it\u2019s worth the price (but it\u2019s on sale right now, go buy!) It\u2019s an Amazon 5 stars because it deserves to stand out among the sea of cheap & poorly-made clothing, but in reality more like 4 stars.NOTE: the tag does say dry-clean only (which I didn\u2019t notice until after multiple washes, lol). I saw people talked about shrinkage, but simply wash in nothing hotter than lukewarm water, and hang dry ONLY, and you won\u2019t have a problem. So far, I don\u2019t have any shrinkage issues.Likes- fits & hangs very nicely. I have a very large bust (32J), so it\u2019s difficult for me to find fitted tops that work for me, and even more unusual to find a top/pant set that both fit. Wide hips also mean sometimes loose/flowy pants don\u2019t hang right on my frame. It\u2019s a unicorn, honestly.- the material feels nice, like a nice textured linen. It doesn\u2019t feel cheap.l and is comfortable to wear.- the stitching is holding up so far, no loose threads.- the versatility - I wear the pants with other shirts and vice versa, or even mix/match colors of different sets.- the waistband looks fitted in the front, which makes it look more expensive in my opinion.- the buttons down the back - they\u2019re not functional, so there\u2019s no pulling apart at the closures when you move. They also look nice.Dislikes:- I just listed this in the likes, but - I wish the fitted portion in the front waistline were just a little shorter (meaning I wish the elastic portion of the waist were longer), or even that there could be a button, though I acknowledge that would probably mean raising the price. I have wide hips and would probably fit better into a medium, but I can barley get the large over my hips. That said, this is probably just fine for many other body types.- speaking of a medium potentially fitting better, it would be great to have the option to mix and match sizes for those of us whose body types necessitate it. For me, a large top and medium bottom would probably fit best (I would try to squeeze it over my hips if I had the option).All that said - I bought it in black, wore it & loved it, and bought khaki. Same quality, same feel of material. I was debating buying another, then saw they\u2019re on sale so I just bought the brick red and the gray-green. I\u2019ll update this review when I get them to talk about the consistency between colors.",

                "reviewText": "Pretty great quality for a linen-looking set! It\u2019s light weight, breezy, stylish on and works great for both short and tall heights. Also, I love the fit at the waist with the flat front and gathered elastic at the back. Very flattering and comfy, especially for a pregnant belly (I\u2019m 25/6 months in my late 2nd trimester in these photos and still wearing my usual size).I\u2019m 5\u20193\u201d, 128 lbs (when not pregnant, currently 144 lbs), B-cup but currently a C and the size small still fit me. The pants are longer/less cropped on my height, but perfect in terms of length for an almost full pant look.Finding the right color was tough, I ended up ordering multiples because the undertone didn\u2019t look the same in photos. I kept the light green and peach and sent the rest back. In order of appearance in photos:-Light grey was too flat in texture for my coloring-Blue was more baby blue than aqua (not what I wanted)-Light green was more dusty sea foam green (a pleasant surprise!)-Yellow was more mustard than a bright yellow-Peach was a cute, Light green, blue, light grey, yellow, peach fun bright coral pink-Apricot was an flat tan and had no peachy or yellow undertonesAlso, beware that if you order multiples, some of them will come with different lengths on the pants and widths on the top. My coral pink one has a slightly longer hem on right side, but it\u2019s fine as my right leg is slightly longer anyway so it\u2019s not as noticeable. Keep ordering in the color you want if you don\u2019t like the hem or length, or take it to a dry cleaner and have it hemmed for cheap.The varied sizing, colors, the fact that the pants even after pressing will always look wrinkled after a bit of wear (the curse of linen clothing) and that this cannot be put in the dryer is the reason it\u2019s not 5 stars. But otherwise excited to wear this for spring, summer, fall!",

                "reviewText": "This set is an awesome find! It's a nice, breathable, linen type fabric with no stretch The buttons on the back are just for detail, which I appreciate, because It means no gaping. The black is versatile, and can be worn as a set, or can be mixed and matched with other pieces for more options.Now for the fit, I am 5'9, and a recent 165 lbs. I am still trying to figure out my best size after massive weightless, so I wasn't very confident about finding the best fit for this set based on reviews. I decided to go based on the size chart, which said that a medium would be = to a 8/10, which are the sizes I'm fitting into most these days. However, the bottoms were tight in the hips/seat, and the top was tight in the chest area. The waist on the pant, which does have some elastic, was also very small the trying to pull up over my rear, and fit a little snug on my waist. I reordered the set in a Large, and I couldn't be happier with the fit now! The wide leg pants hit me about mid calf, I have plenty of room in the hips/seat, and the waist is just a little loose, but not so much that the pants are falling down. Really, it's just enough to make the pants comfortable when sitting. The crop top hits a little shorter than expected (just above the bottom of my rib cage) but I have a long torso, so not super surprising. The arm holes are a much better fit in the large too, as the medium size arm holes were a little small. The holes are a perfect size to keep your bra from showing if you lift your arms, but if you have bigger arms, or a larger chest, they might be a little snug.My overall measurements for comparison:5'9165 lbs41.5 in hip29 in waist34D",
