I'm keeping it because it does fit, and sometimes I like have a neat, fitted dress. BUT. There are quite a few reviews that say not to size up, and this is not accurate advice for the product I ordered. The bottom button is literally even with my crotch. I just now ordered an additional dress and sized up, because I really want the length for casual wear during the warmer months, and I can't really bend over in the size I ordered without ensuring that I'm very lady-like, knees bent, shoulders up, you know what I mean. I'm only giving it four stars because the buttons aren't quite right for a more tailored look when I move, reach, etc. There's just enough pull that the button gap will require a full slip, but because of how short it is, it's going to require one of those body suit slips which are not super comfortable in hot weather. For reference, I am 5\u20198 and most often wear a 10.",

                "reviewText": "I got this because it said it was a cotton/linen blend. What I got is marked 100% polyester. I wanted the cotton/linen blend so it would be cool in the summer. The polyester is not. I'll have to wear it in the fall and winter with pants. It should hold up well because polyester washes well and lasts forever, but I love linen. It looks nice but is considerably stiffer than the model images. It doesn't drape like cotton/linen would. The length also shrank a little after washing in cool water and hanging dry (no drier). Maybe that's just because it crinkled up a little more.There are things I really like about it--I love that it has upper and lower pockets and I really like the cut. Straight button-down shirt dresses are hard to come by these days. I like the style and the crinkle in the fabric. Its important to understand the difference between straight cuts and A-line cuts. In the product image, it looks like the dress might be A-line, but the dress I got is cut totally straight. The side seams are cut in a straight line down from the bust. There's no angle providing extra inches like you get with an A-line cut. This works best for women whose bust and hips are about the same size and who look good in pencil skirts rather than A-line skirts. Its not going to fit well on women who have significantly larger hips or heavy thighs. As long as you wear straight skirts well, it will look good.Its sewn well and generally true to size, and I would have given it a higher rating if they had been honest about the fabric content.",
