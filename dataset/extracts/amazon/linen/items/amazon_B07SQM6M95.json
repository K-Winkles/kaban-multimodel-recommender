                "reviewText": "These shirts are fantastic for hot weather travel! I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d and 180 and bought my regular size, which is large. It\u2019s roomy enough to hide my tummy and keep the breezes flowing, but not too loose. I don\u2019t know if they actually have any linen in them, but cotton gauze is great for wrinkle-free packing, and these did not disappoint.I originally bought a blue and a green to wear on some upcoming trips. I took them to Hawaii, Argentina, and India for a total of about 10 weeks of travel. It was hot everywhere I went, like up to 100 degrees in Argentina and super humid in India, and I was really cool and comfortable in these shirts. It probably helped that they were a little oversized on me. I wore them constantly. I travel with only one small carryon, so my travel clothes take a beating. These shirts held up very well, and washed and line dried and looked great. Absolutely no need to iron, and I never put them in the dryer. They line dry very quickly. After the last trip and a lot of wear, they looked a little tired and had some snags, so I replaced them and also bought a white and a black one, for a total of six purchased. I love these shirts.One observation on some of the size differences others have noted. The nature of cotton gauze with its loose weave is to shrink and stretch a bit. When you take them off the clothes line, they\u2019re smaller but you can (gently) pull on them a bit and they get bigger right away or with wearing they definitely get bigger.My only wish is that they came in more colors, especially more dark shades that are practical for travel, and some cooler tones for those of us who can\u2019t wear orange and gold. If they came in purple, teal or dark pink, I would buy them all.",

The sleeves just about come to my elbow and cover my ugly upper arm skin. Neckline is good, as is the length even after washing and drying. I will get more for sure. I'm 5'4\" and 120 pounds, usually wear a small. This is true to size in my opinion and a nice loose fit.",

I purchased 2 more in Medium. There was a HUGE difference between large and medium. I'm thinking my original Large was mis-marked and is actually and XL. That all being said, this is a fantastic shirt. It can be dressed up or down depending what you wear it with. It is the coolest summer shirt I own! I have it in the cream color and it is a little see through. I wear a tank bra with it and that works well. I will be purchasing again in a large and hope that it fits properly. The medium was a true medium!",

This shirt kept me much cooler than a regular tee would have.It drapes well, and is very comfortable and more stylish than a t shirt. I will definitely buy more colors!",

I usually wear a large or extra large, (14-16) and in this one Large is comfortably generous even after washing. Travels well, DOESNT wrinkle, needs no ironing to look good, and is just thick enough not to show what's underneath. The fabric contracts a little after machine washing & drying and has a slight waffly appearance which is attractive and lends a bit of interest to an otherwise plain shirt. Looks better on than in the picture! I am ordering another!",

                "reviewText": "I love these tops but the white xl was huge on me. The black xl is smaller with a slightly different collar width. They're a nice, medium to heavyweight linen and dyed richly. From the 3 I purchased in varied colors, sizing is a little different with each; however, xl in any dyed version seems to be the best fit for me whereas the white I probably could've went down a size. I'm quite busty with a 36dddd/38ddd, so I'm always struggling to correctly size tops. I don't like them pulled tight across my chest. These are comfortable, and soft linen, or more of a linen/cotton blend. I did order one in the orange that was packaged terribly and damaged in transit which stained the fabric, as well as being 2 days late; however, Amazon accepted the damaged return and very promptly sent my replacement. The tops themselves are exactly what I was looking for and I'm otherwise very happy with them.",

Also launders beautifully. It runs large in general so order a size down. There is some variation in sizing. I had to reorder one because it was at least 2 sizes smaller than on the tag. Not sure if it was a fluke or if all in that color (blue gray) are mismarked.",
