It would be so easy to wear warmer leggings and a sleeve under or over so I could see this as a year round option! (Credibility: I am plus size in Mississippi)I bought a XXL because I wanted a baggier look. I\u2019m currently like a 16-18 with a 39\u201d waist and 51\u201d hips and 5\u20193\u201d and it\u2019s hitting right at the top of my feet with the straps adjusted so I feet like I could also skip on having to wear a heel if I want to. Fitting exactly as I wanted on the baggies scale!Only 2 downsides: coffee is more of a burnt orange and doesn\u2019t resemble the picture at all. I took a picture in artificial and natural lightJust be prepared to be frustrated with the little adjusters on the strap. Upside is they seem sturdy and I don\u2019t see them loosening over time since it\u2019s so hard to move them! They also provided extras.Definitely recommending to friends and will probably buy another color myself!",

Since i am on the shorter side, the crotch area was wayyy too low! I was walking around like i had pooped myself. I ended up cutting and sewed part of the straps in order for the crotch area to be higher. I cut maybe like an inch? off. It fit way better after that! they are also pretty long length wise but again, after the shrinking in the wash, they were a little better. I wear them with platform shoes so i didnt feel the need to fix the length. I got it back in August and was considering getting another one. I love it just know if youre shorter youre gonna have to do some sewing!",

However, bought it in a size higher than normal (2XL, when I wear a 1XL). However, trying it on, I found it still a bit tight. I am going to buy this again, but try a 3XL and see if this is the way to go. Also, be aware that these pants sit right above the ankle. For reference I am 5\u20197\u201d. I bought these to wear for warmer days. Recommend buying 2-3 sizes higher up than what you usually wear. Overall, despite the initial return, these are wonderful casual overalls! Would recommend washing them in cold water and hang to dry to prevent shrinkage.",

Fits great and has adjustable straps for a more structured fit if you want it! Easy enough to get on and off to use the restroom ladies! Which is huge in this time of jumpers that end up in a workout to pee! Highly recommend!",
