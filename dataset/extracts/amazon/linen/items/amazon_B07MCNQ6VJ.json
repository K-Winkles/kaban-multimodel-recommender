There really isn't anything substantial to complain about, so... :)Here are my \"observations\" and why I gave the pants four stars instead of the five they so nearly deserve. I write this hoping the manufacturer will make a great pair of pants even better. Here are ways the pants could be improved:1) Add a rear pocket. It wouldn't take much and it would let folks like myself carry a wallet.2) Make the side pockets 1\" deeper. With the commonality of large call phones, these pockets are just slightly too shallow to carry one safely.3) Make the elastic waistband a little less aggressive. It's a bit too wide and \"springy\".4) Add a fly. This one is in bonus territory. It's convenient, but not necessary unless the same level of comfort can be retained.5) Do something to make the fabric a bit wrinkle-resistant. This is again in bonus territory. I'm honestly not that concerned about wrinkles when I head to the beach. That said, be aware that these pants wrinkle and crease with almost no provocation :)",

These were just a different colour (dark green).Everything was fine until I washed them. They shrank at least 3 sizes!! The size difference almost comical. That never happened with previous purchases of what was supposed to be the same pants, so perhaps it was a bad batch (?)After some back & forth with supplier they finally gave full refund.",

Die blaue Hose ist so lange, dass ich sie k\u00fcrzen lassen muss. Die beige Hose ist so kurz, dass es gerade eben so geht und die dunkelbraune Hose ist als einzige Hose passend.",

I have long legs so this was a bit shorter than I would have liked but they essentially fit as ordered. Unfortunately there are no tags nor washing instructions so I am concerned about shrinkage. I bought khaki and it's very see through so guys, make sure your package is packaged before heading out.",
