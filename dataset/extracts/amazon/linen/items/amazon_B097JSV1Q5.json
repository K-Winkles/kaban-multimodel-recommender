A: After receiving feedback and suggestions from previous consumers, we have upgraded the proportion of fabric components, the pockets have become smaller, and the shape of the hem of the clothes has also been slightly changed, so the batches received may be different. The real object shall prevail, thank you for your understanding. Q: How to wash this shirts? Will it shrink? A: It will slightly shrink because of natural cotton fabric. Here are several garment care tips: 1. Choose neutral detergent or professional cotton linen detergent to wash. 2. Wash in cold water, fix the color in salt water, dry naturally and steam iron. 3. Cotton material, comfortable, suggest to wash by hand or machine wash softly. 4. It is suggested that buyers should not mix wash, and do not directly contact clothes with some color damaging ingredients such as washing powder and 84 disinfectant.",

                "reviewText": "I accidentally ordered 2 shirts a day apart. 01Blue. Will keep both as when one wears out I have another. Has a boho quilt-like look. Will go over any color tank. Fabric is breathable. There are no cuffs but I love not having buttons at the cuff because I'm rolling the sleeves up like the seller's photos. I ordered XXL which is my recommended size because I like things a little loose. Was really big and long. No problem as I'm going to hem the bottom. I washed the one from yesterday like I wash most things. Cold water wash and dryer on medium dry. Came out good Compared to the one I got today the sleeves shrank maybe 2 inches and are perfect now. The chest lost 2-3 inches. The length 3-4 inches. It's perfect.",
