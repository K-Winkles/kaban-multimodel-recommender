It also doesn\u2019t wrinkle like you\u2019d expect real cotton/linen blends to do (squeeze linen in your fist. It will wrinkle and not spring back. This item wrinkled a little, then smoothed itself out.)And unfortunately, the shirt doesn\u2019t have a label inside telling you the fabric makeup.

As the picture shows, the V in the front goes way farther down than indicated in the item images. The point of the V went to the bottom of the sternum - can't wear a bra with it. Also the sides veered way farther up, and that never showed in the images. The sides opened up to the bottom rib bone - can't even tucked the shirt in. The only thing I liked about the shirt was the material - very soft and breezy. Alas, this was a return item.",

                "reviewText": "Arrived quickly. Beige colour is pleasing. Tag on garment says it's made in China but there is no label anywhere on the item to verify that it is actually linen and/or any other fabric. Just because an add says it's a linen cotton mixture doesn't actually mean it is. Too heavy a garment for 70% linen. Packaging was just a small clear plastic bag with the shirt scrunched inside so it came out covered in wrinkles which naturally happens with linen so I am assuming that there is actually linen in it. Not overly impressed. Watch the measurement chart. The front dips quite low for first button so bra shows slightly. Very long in front and back. I like loose fitting clothes so I don't mind too much. I usually buy clothes in stores so I can touch and try on. This has made me want to return to store purchasing of clothes rather than internet purchases. I personally think it is overpriced.",
