                "reviewText": "I got these shorts for a trip to Jamaica that I'm taking in the end of May. I'm usually a medium or a large if the sizing runs small, so I ordered a large, and let me tell you... I'm glad I did. Honestly I could have probably gone with an extra large if I wanted the shorts to be a bit looser. The large is pretty form fitting on me, and there is no extra space in the legs, but the shorts are still super comfortable. The length is nice, as they aren't incredibly short. For reference, I'm 5'4, about 165 lbs, and I've got a booty and moderately thick thighs.",

                "reviewText": "These are cute, casual, flattering shorts. FYI the elastic waistband mentioned in the product title is minimally \"elastic\" - I've found it mostly relies on the string closure to keep them up - so tie it tight if you want them to stay up! (They'd be a little easier to take on/off if the elastic was a little more stretchy. But overall they are good, and I have a couple pairs now. I am 5'2\", 105 lbs and got the size small. They are a bit roomy - but I think in the way they're meant to look, and they are comfy and not too short for my liking. (If you are similar size you probably could get a size XS and they'd fit ok but I'd imagine maybe extra short).",

I\u2019m going on vacation in 2 days so I don\u2019t really have time to order another one. The material is a nice linen though and it fit well. For size reference, I got an extra small and I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d and between 120 and 125 pounds with a 25\u201d waist and 35.5in hips, if that helps anyone.
