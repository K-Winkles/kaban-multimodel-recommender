That said, I\u2019m in my early 50s and my tummy isn\u2019t as tiny as it was in my 20s, so I sometimes have a hard time with waist being a little tight. The Small fit me perfectly!I purchased these in grey but I wouldn\u2019t really describe these as \u201cdenim\u201d. But the color is unique (very soft grey, more like taupe) and looks great with lots of different colored tops! They\u2019re really lightweight so great for summertime - and they are super cute! I usually avoid elastic waist pants, which I find old lady-ish, but these still look modern either dressed up with booties or down with sandals. Can\u2019t wait to take these to the beach!",
