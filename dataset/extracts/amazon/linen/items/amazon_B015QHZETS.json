                "reviewText": "I have been looking for some linen-blend dress pants for Summer for some time with limited success. Got these as they were some of the only ones I could find that were a good color and in the right size. They fit as expected and the fabric is very lightweight, but not see through. Perfect for a dressy casual summer outfit. The only down side, in my opinion (and thus the 4 stars versus 5), is that they are flat front instead of having pleats and they lack cuffs at the bottom. This is a personal taste thing (I think the pleats- though perhaps dated these days-- work better for me, and I just like cuffs at the bottom) and in no way affects the fact that these are very nice pants for the features they have and I am, on the whole, satisfied with the purchase and am looking forward to wearing them again.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable without bagginess, and suitable for the office",
                "reviewText": "Finally! Every summer for the past few (maybe several) years, I've gone looking for some linen or linen blend dress pants. Something I could wear to the office on these 90+ degree days here along the Gulf Coast. And every year I would get frustrated and give up after sifting through an abundance of baggy, drawstring-waisted, beach pants. I might find one or two offerings from some high end brands, but at eye-watering prices.Not this year, though. I finally found exactly what I was looking for: cool, comfortable linen blend pants that are appropriate for work and pair well with a sportcoat or blazer, and which are not priced like a new suit.Fit: slightly tailored but without being tight. I've got somewhat thick thighs for my waist size, which means I often try on pants that fit beautifully as long as I remain standing and then become uncomfortably tight around the quads the moment I sit down. These pants pass the all-important sitting test, which so many others fail. The legs hang fairly straight below the knee with a medium break at the ankle when ordered in my usual length. After a wash or two, I did notice a small amount of shrinkage, but not enough to significantly alter the fit. For reference, I am 6'0\", 185lbs and typically wear 34W x 34L, which is what I ordered here.Color: I have two pair, one in navy blue and one in \"natural\" linen. The natural pair is a fairly light color, darker than off-white, but not by much, and certainly lighter than tan. Think unbleached paper cone coffee filter. The coloring has a little bit of natural variation. The navy pair, however, has an even and consistent color throughout that tends to mask the texture of the fabric unless seen up close, so the pants aren't obviously linen when seen from more than a few feet away.Care: Since these are dress pants, you won't want to go with the crumpled look of casual linen beach wear. And that means you do have to iron them a bit as they'll come out of the dryer looking a little shriveled on the legs. A few touches with an iron set on high is all it takes to flatten out any major wrinkles, though, and the rest seems to fall into place.",
