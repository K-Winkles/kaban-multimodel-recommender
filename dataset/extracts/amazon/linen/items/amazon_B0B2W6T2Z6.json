I misted the jacket with water and tossed it in my dryer on de wrinkle and that worked really well. 5\u2019 140 lbs",

So it made it look like there were a bunch of tiny stains all over it. Plus, there was a whole in the front of the jacket. It looked like the linen had gotten caught in something sharp and it tore a whole through it.I requested a replacement jacket because I loved the look of the jacket and the fit was amazing.The second jacket came quickly and had a yellow stain on the back of it, but there were no random threads woven throughout the fabric and I still really loved the jacket.I tried to get another replacement and Amazon only gave me the option for a full return. But instead of making it easy and allowing me to drop it off at Kohl\u2019s like I was able to do with the first jacket, I now have to ship it through UPS. Then, if I still want the jacket I have to reorder again. This means I won\u2019t get a discount that I had from the original order.It feels like amazing tried to make this second return more difficult in hopes that I wouldn\u2019t go through with it. I find this really frustrating and I\u2019m just disappointed with the quality of the jacket because it\u2019s such a nice piece of clothing if they would just take care of their products in the warehouse prior to shipping.",
