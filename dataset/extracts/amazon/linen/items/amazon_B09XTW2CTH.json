I went shopping and I was stopped by another shopper and was sincerely complimented on these overalls. They are not too short and I wear these loosely over me. The length of the shorts were perfect, not too long or short.I have an issue with fibers other than cotton, so I can wear these without having to run to the doctors office. I machine washed these on delicate and let them air dry as I was afraid they would shrink. They did tighten up a bit after letting these air dry, so, hopefully they won't shrink anymore. In the meantime, I feel cute and comfortable wearing my shorts overalls.",

I wasn't to fond of the material they were made out of but wasn't to bad and actually was light feeling during an extremely hot day when I did have them on. I'm not a skinny model and these looked great on me (someone with some meat on her bones \ud83d\ude09). I also paired it with a crop topped tank which looked great because I did feel to exposed on the sides but was able to where a cropped tank and it looked great with them.Also true to size, I believe I went up in size to have it a bit more loose thou I could have e stayed at my normal size.",

Its not a big butt, but its definitely there. When these arrived i tried them on and, not gonna lie, they barely went up. Once they did, they were so cute! Not too much fabric in the belly, so it wont look weird when you sit, but still just loose enough to not hug my fat! Good fairly thick fabric and good length for my 5\u20191\u201d frame. Cant wait to wear them out somewhere!For reference i am 165lbs and ordered medium",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because RawBeautyKrisiti recommended it. It's okay but not great. They fit okay but there isn't much stretch to them. My biggest complaint is the fabric. For something that is supposed to be made out of cotton and linen, the fabric is very rough. It feels unpleasant when my thighs rub together, like I'm wearing a potato sack. They are also very thin, which hugs every roll on your body, especially when you sit down. Im also afraid of how they will hold up when washed. They don't seem very durable. Would I buy it again, maybe? If it was on sale? Definitely absolutely not worth full price though.",
