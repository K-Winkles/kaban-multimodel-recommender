I'm currently 36\" bust, 30\" waist, and 39\" hip, and the medium is fine (it would be a bit big but I don't think a smaller size would be big enough to comfortably clear my hips). I got the red color and it's a very bright, candy apple red. Anyway, very happy with this buy!",

I\u2019m so sad this didn\u2019t work out but for being such a relaxed fit, there\u2019s no reason there should be any issue with visible pockets on this piece. They stuck out and make my hips look bizarre. Ruined the whole streamlined minimal cut this otherwise would achieve. Returned :(",

                "reviewText": "Truly had a low bar set for my expectations buying a linen top off amazon, but was pretty surprised at how nice this top was. I will say it is a bit sheer (I purchased the white top\u2014which no matter what is tough not to be somewhat see-through), and it shrank a little when washed and dried (my fault\u2014forgot to remove before dryer), but overall I really liked this top. Purchased for a beach vacation and used every day as cover up, washed and dried several times. Stayed together nicely and was ready to wear even when not ironed and removed early from dryer\u2026I\u2019m not too picky about a few wrinkles in a linen top.",

Dresses can be a real gamble when ordering online, but I read a lot of reviews, was realistic with my size (xxl) and decided that if black was unavailable, white would be the best classic colour.I am so happy with this dress; it fits so well, is slimming, comfortable and had a great solid weight to it. I\u2019m planning on wearing it throughout the summer and into the early fall and shifting with shoes, scarves and jackets/sweaters.This is a great classic piece and I\u2019m just sorry that I missed it in black!
