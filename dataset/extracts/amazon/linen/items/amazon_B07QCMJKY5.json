It is full cut in the body, too wide for my slender frame but nice for loose fit. Most guys my height are heavier and wider. The 80% Cotton/ 20% FLAX is very comfortable.

                "reviewText": "I bought this shirt to wear to a wedding on the beach in FL. Unfortunately COVID changed our travel plans and we didn't go to the wedding. I broke out the shirt for the first time to wear to a 50th bday party that was outdoors in 95 degree temps with 85%+ Humidity. It was brutal but I felt comfortable and cool the whole evening. I was worried a bit about sweating because of the color of the shirt but I was so comfortable that it never was an issue.Great styling and the fit was perfect for me to wear this untucked with some casual shorts. I am 6'4\" and 220 lbs. Truly a super comfortable shirt. I can't comment on the durability as I have only worn it a couple of times but so far it is holding up fine. It is very lightweight (but that is kind of the point of a linen shirt) and therefore you feel cooler while you are wearing it. I have gotten multiple compliments on this shirt and a few people asking where I bought it.I would definitely recommend it for any hot weather or beach type events that require something a little more \"dressy\" but still very casual and comfortable. The fabric does wrinkle a lot so you either have to be obsessive about your ironing or just give it a quick iron and live with the wrinkles as they tend to go hand-in-hand with linen anyways. Great shirt, I was very happy with this purchase.",
