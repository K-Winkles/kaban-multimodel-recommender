The fitted sheet is designed to fit most mattresses up to 16 inches and boasts deep pockets for a snug fit that effectively encases the mattress and prevents it from sliding. Finely Stitched, Well-made The top section of the linen flat sheet is intentionally designed to be wider, creating a striking contrast with the bottom part of the sheet, showcasing a unique visual effect. The edges of the bed sheet are crafted through a fine sewing process, resulting in a strong and durable finish, resistant to thread breakage even after numerous washes. This linen flat sheet, designed with both comfort and aesthetics in mind, is an excellent choice for enhancing the look and feel of your bedroom. Elastic Design All Around The elastic cord design surrounding the sheet ensures a snug fit between the sheet and the mattress, bolstering the support of the sheet and preventing it from sliding or deforming. The material and thickness of the elastic cords are carefully selected, and pulling them is also labor-saving, making it suitable for various shapes and sizes of mattresses. Eratinse Linen Sheets 4 Pieces This 4-piece linen sheet set is a premium choice for bedroom bedding. The set consists of a linen flat sheet, a linen fitted sheet, and two envelope pillowcases, offering you plenty of matching options. The design of the bed sheet and pillowcases is simple and generous, suiting a variety of home styles.",

The color is neutral and warm and the feel is a slight weave texture but is not scratchy. I was afraid the sheet would be too thin but it is not. I did notice a small snag in the sheets out of the packaging so it makes me a bit hesitant on how durable this sheet will be long term. I am, thus far, very pleased with the sheet and like that the color is neutral enough that it will work with most of my bedding sets.",

                "reviewText": "Why I wanted a real linen fitted sheet?...... For the positive benefits of the fabric's \"frequency\". Yes, that's right, the fabric's, frequency. This isn't some new age, fringe, theory or esoteric concept, it's raw real science, the results of actual frequency testing of various fabric's, in a controlled lab setting. Use any search engine except Google, to avoid the most blatant bias and censorship, and search \"fabric frequency study\", and read up on it yourself... fascinating stuff. It turns out that the human body resonates at a frequency of (I don't recall the name of the units of measurements used so I'll just use the the numbers without the unit of measurement notation, that would normally follow) ... the human body has a frequency of between 70 and 100, with someone who is not in good health, having a much lower frequency, on average. It is believed with good reason, that fabrics with frequencies that match that of the human body, are at least \"neutral\" in their effects on the body. Organic cotton for example comes in at 100, matching that of the healthy human body... this is the minimum you should strive for in all fabrics that come into contact with your body. Non-organic cotton, has a frequency below 70, meaning not good. And man-made synthetic fabrics such a rayon, spandex, polyester, etc, have very low frequencies, like in the 5 to 15 range ... suggesting a negative effect on the body. These fabrics should be avoided if at all possible. Now, this study found that there's such a thing as \"super fabrics\", namely, linen and wool... and likely cashmere and hemp, but those weren't included in the study, so we can't be sure about those. Anyhow, both linen and wool, have frequencies, of 5,000. That's 5K. Wow. Quite an up tick from organic cotton, at 100. Even The Bible mentions that it's beneficial to wear wool or linen, but it cautions against wearing both, at the same time.... and guess what the study found out?... If you combine linen and wool, the frequencies counteract each other, and you end of with 0 frequency, which is thought to be detrimental to the body, just like synthetic fabrics are. So, somehow, the Bible people knew about this thousand's of years ago, which I find amazing. Search \"wool and linen in The Bible\" and see for yourself. Utterly amazing, and confirmation of the study's findings ...or rather, vice versa. I'm no expert and I'm certainly not a medical professional, but I have looked at this legitimate study and it makes real scientific sense to me. Did you know they used to use linen sheets in all hospitals... they used linen in the hospitals for it's healing ability, as I understand it. It wasn't until the Rockefeller pharmaceutical take over of \"modern medicine\", over a hundred years ago, that hospitals began to replace linen sheets with inferior fabrics... one's that cause sickness, instead of helping the body to heal itself.... which sure seems to \"figure\", with what we've learned about the big pharma and big medicine industrial complex, over the last few years.... there's some real snakes out there... forked tongues and all, or so it seems to me.... but what do I know? Well, I probably know more than than want me to know, that's for sure... that's the way I see it anyway. And to bring this back full circle, I obviously love this sheet, because it's 100% linen, and linen is a super fabric, that helps the body in a positive sense, or at least that's what the fabric study found. Now, I think we can all agree at least on the following statement: Enough said, already. Over and out.",

The sheet is well made, with elastic all way around. It washed nicely, and got a bit softer in the drier. I expect subsequent washings will make it even softer. The color is natural and neutral. It fits my standard queen mattress with enough left over for tucking in that I believe it would fit an extra thick mattress. It's winter here now, so I haven't had a chance to use this in hot weather,which is where linen is supposed to be the best. I will update this review in summer.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. So full disclosure:1. I ordered this not realizing it was not a full sheet set. So the price seemed unbelievable. Even knowing it is just the fitted sheet, it is pretty awesome.2. I am also really bad at reading comprehension. I was anticipating this being cotton and that they were using the term \"linen\" in the generic bedding/tablecloth kind of way. They are not. It is actually a linen fitted sheet.So in my review, I tried to approach it for the actual quality of the item, and not any disappointment because I didn't really take the time to read the description carefully. In my video I try and show the way it fit on our memory foam mattress. That mattress is king sized, but has a shallow depth, so my comments on the fit must be taken with that in mind. A pillow-top or even standard sized King mattress might fit better.PROS:- The sheet feels very well made. We washed it and it came out of the wash virtually wrinkle free, it is thick enough to feel like it will last a long time and was surprisingly soft.- It looks very nice. While you may need to purchase a matching sheet and pillow cases, it is a nice light beige with a slight linen pattern to it.- The stitching and seams are very well done, and the elastic is sound. Even when I first opened the package, the sheet felt like it was high quality.CONS:- Linen is a different feel if you are used to cotton sheets. It has a little more texture to it and while it is soft, it is not the same as cotton. I am not sure I would be comfortable on this sheet until I got used to it- You would have to either be replacing a fitted sheet in a similar style, or would have to purchase the other items separately.I marked the comfort as 3 stars, but that is with the understanding that it is just not what I am used to or would probably use for our personal bed.",
