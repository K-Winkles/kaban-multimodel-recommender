I ordered one in med and one in large because often I find things undersized from Amazon, but the medium Fit perfectly! If you are also on the line between two sizes, size down!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this dress for a celebration of life at a golf course. It\u2019s a pretty dress and it was 103 degrees out so I wasn\u2019t sweating in it, BUT\u2026. Amazon advised to get a size large, for some reason I went against it. I ordered a medium. It was still big. I\u2019m a 34D so the chest area fit nice. But I did notice a HUGE gap of excess fabric behind my neck. Keep in mind it\u2019s a zip up dress. The holes on the side were noticiable, but the fabric went too far out exaggerating a hip that doesn\u2019t exist within my body. It is also not stretchy which was fine with me. I am 5\u20192\u201d and it fit just above my knees. I\u2019m 130 lbs and the bottom half of the dress was just too big. It is a cute dress but didn\u2019t work for me.",

The style, cut, design, and quality are just superb & I love how I looked / felt in this dress! Even ordered a long sleeve version for fall! Accentuates all the right curves & gives an elite, striking look.I got so many compliments! Washed well (gentle cycle with cold water & hung up to dry) and didn\u2019t shrink. It does wrinkle but if you steam / iron it, it\u2019s great! Don\u2019t skip getting the wrinkles out though if you want it to look as polished & sleek as it does on the model.All in all, I loved this little dress! I got it in white & it\u2019s not see through at all! Ordered my usual size (M) and it fit perfectly.Order it! You won\u2019t regret it!",
