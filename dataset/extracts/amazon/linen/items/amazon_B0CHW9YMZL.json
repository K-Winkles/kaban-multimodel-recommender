Perfect for work in a causal business office environment. My coworkers keep complementing me on them. I washed first in cold water - no soak - no dryer, let air dry (preserves all clothes actually) and they are soft and breathable. I bought another pair in black to replace a linen pant that has always been just a little less soft. Waiting for the true yellow now to make its appearance!",
