                "reviewText": "My husband is 5\u201911\u201d, 185 lbs. and has a 35\u201d waist. I ordered these Cotton drawstring pants for him in a size x-large based on the size chart that was posted along with the pictures of the item on the product description page. Living in South Florida, not far from the beach, these pants are absolutely perfect for relaxed time spent out and about. The very first thing he said when he put these pants on was \u201cMan, are thee comfortable!\u201d That\u2019s quite the statement from him. Not only are the pants fashionable for casual outings (like going to an outdoor restaurant or walks on the beach) but the fabric is comfortable against the skin, lightweight and breathable. They can be worn very comfortably on warmer days, yet still give just the right amount of extra warmth for cooler evenings. The pants also have side pockets. The construction of the pants is excellent with no loose stitching or uneven seams. I've had no problem putting these in the washing machine but I do only very lightly dry them in the dryer before removing to hang dry the rest of the way. So far there has been no fading, stretching or shrinkage, so I am very happy with how they look on him after each wash. This purchase was an incredible addition to his wardrobe and I would happily buy them for him again.",

                "reviewText": "The leg is SO wide! I look like a genie wannabe. They are comfortable. I ordered a size larger after reading other reviews, so they were a good six inches too long. I washed and dried them on medium and they shrunk so dramatically in length, they are a solid inch too short to wear out of the house. I\u2019m going to use them as lounge wear at home. Even if I condition them and stretch some length back out of them, they are so wide legged they definitely look like women\u2019s pants to me. Even if I don\u2019t label them by sex like that, they remind me of a genie or highly dramatic, flamboyant eccentric who would wear a wide brimmed hat to match. Like, to pull these off, I need to buy some huge sunglasses, start smoking extra long cigarettes and and walking like Nathan Lane in The Birdcage. Not for me.",

I ordered a large and an extra large because sometimes I fall right in between. The XL's were nearly 4in too short, and the super thin, completely unsubstantial fabric, was see-through. When I tried these on for my wife and daughter they could clearly see my underwear. I changed into a lighter color underwear to see if it helped and it did not. Found a much better and more substantial pair of beach style pants at a local Belk and actually spent less than these paper thin wannabes.",
