They *are* pilling a little already, but i think it just kinda comes with the territory of this kind of fabric. I don't particularly mind.

                "reviewText": "I'm pretty disappointed in these. I had high hopes after falling in love with a different style in the same fabric from this brand. I thought these would be nice to have but even after sizing up I still felt like they were just a little too small. I am pear shaped and carry my weight in my hips/bum and these just couldn't fully accommodate that like the other style can. Sadly these will be going back and I'll just stick to the other ones. For reference I'm usually a size US 12/14 post baby (10/12 normally) and bought the XL. If you aren't curvy these would work for you, but keep in mind this material does tend to shrink a bit.",
