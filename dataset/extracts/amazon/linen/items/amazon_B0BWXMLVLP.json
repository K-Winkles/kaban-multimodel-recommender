I would have given it five stars since it\u2019s a great price and comfy, but I don\u2019t like having to mess with the top when walking around. The material also picks up spots easily- I don\u2019t remember having anything that would stain, but the little spots didn\u2019t come out in regular wash and I had to use spot remover.",

Stretchy soft, and double lined linen pants that you can dress up. The shirt is ehh, probably won\u2019t wear it but the price is worth it for the pants. I loved them so much I decided to buy 3 more colors. Black, brown, and tan.I was so excited to add to my collection. when I unwrapped them it was a bit odd.The black one felt like wet. Almost like when you don\u2019t dry your clothes enough and they\u2019re just moist. But I was like whatever- I put them on and they were SHORT AND THIN. Not as soft as the beige ones and weren\u2019t as long. The shirt didn\u2019t feel like the same material as the beige either. I tried on the Brown and tan and the same thing!! I\u2019m not sure why they\u2019re not the same material and fit as the beige pant but I\u2019m about to order a couple more beige just in case mine get ruined or shrunk because the beige one is THE ESSENTIAL PANT EVERY WOMAN NEEDS.",

That's because I am well endowed ( God given) I am 5'4\" ,137 # however I am dieting so it shouldn't be a problem. I bought it for a bridal shower at a nice restaurant and it will be perfect. The pants also fit very nicely. I bought a large, thought it would be too big but I needed the large top. All in all I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Definitely recommend.",
