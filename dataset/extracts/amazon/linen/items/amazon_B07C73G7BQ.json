                "reviewText": "Update 11/5/23: The seams in the legs are being stretched too much. They are holding up but the fabric is thinning and there are lil holes around the seams. I should have stuck with Large, but that\u2019s okay. Still super comfy and can be lounge pants if I wear em out.Current Stats: 5\u20194, 150, weight mostly in chest and thighs. Hip cir: 42, waist: 36. This is my second time purchasing these pants. Two years ago I purchased the large size in pink and brown. They stretched and look more like PJ pants on me. I made the mistake of wearing the brown ones around my foster kittens and they made holes in the leg. I latched them and use them as garden pants. The pink ones are well worn but I use them as lounge pants and treat them pretty roughly. They have faded to a paler pink but still pretty and nice! This time around I\u2019ve gotten Medium so I can use as wardrobe clothing. They are a little stiff and tight in the upper leg at first but these soften and loosen up so nicely. The waist is comfy and all the colors are sewn the same so there is not a variation between colors. I love the pocket size. These pants are perfect for hot and humid weather as they are super breathable. They are not sheer but I would be cautious with lighter colors in matching base layers to skin tone if you choose to wear a base layer. The ankle is not as fitted as I would like, but they don\u2019t look bad. For these I will be delicate washing and air drying to preserve the color and fabric longer - just a preference, my pink pants are going strong and I\u2019ve been throwing them in normal loads and drying them in the dryer. \ud83e\udd23 They do wrinkle a bit because of the linen content, but that\u2019s hot weather clothes in general, and nobody cares when everyone is equally melty in hot weather. I work with 100% linen and I don\u2019t think this is a pure linen fabric as the behavior is a bit different. I definitely love them and think they are worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "I'm wearing these for work. Its a semi professional semi casual dress code. I bought these with linens high frequency and healing properties in mind. I have been wearing a synthetic material pant for over a year to work and have knee problems. I'm hoping the linen pants will help in my healing process, and if not, they're still very comfortable and the fit is perfect. I'm a bit large waisted an got the XXL and the fit is just right everywhere. It's slightly baggy actually and I like that since linen doesn't have any natural stretch to it. They're a tad long but I prefer that and can roll them up if needed and it doesn't look bad rolled, it's cute. The pockets are deep and can hold a cell phone with room to spare. The material is a nice thick quality. The only thing I'm worried about is the stitching. I saw 2 other reviews that were concerning. When I put these on, I will say I bent over to dry my hair upside down with the hair dryer, and heard a ripping sound. However after looking at the pants, nothing had torn. I won't know until they get washed and I wear them again and will update this review if there is an issue. But after wearing them all night at work they performed great. So far so good. So much so I want another pair, as long as the price stays fair. I appreciate these pants. Thank you, whoever makes them.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Real (yes, real) linen pants",
                "reviewText": "I've been looking for real linen pants to wear on an upcoming trip. I wanted something that was not see through and that didn't have those \"palazzo\"-wide legs. I gave this product 4 stars only because I was hoping to find pants in the under $30 price range rather than $35 and over. If I factor out the price the product would be 5 stars. What I like: the pants are 100% linen and the material is substantial (not see through in the black color I ordered, but I expect that it would be the same for the lighter colors); they have side pockets, a front drawstring and back elastic. The cut is versatile enough to be suitable for wearing for walking around/sightseeing as well as dressed up for anything but fancy/formal wear. The pants have a nice look to them out of the bag (more tailored than linen often does) and the material is not scratchy. I won't wash them during the trip so I can't comment as to whether they will shrink or how the fabric/dye will hold up after washing. Because they are linen I expect wrinkling but I think they will look fine even with wrinkles. On me (5'2\", 29\" inseam) the pants come right past my ankles, which I like because they look like regular pants, not longer capris).What I don't like: I had a very difficult time settling on the right size because I fell between the M and L (I'm 5'2\", 135 lbs, 30-31\" waist). I picked the L because I figured that looser was better for travel and, especially in case the material shrinks when I do ultimately wash it. Out of the bag the pants fit fine at the drawstring waist (maybe a little loose but the drawstring will work its magic) but have a few more inches of material in the tummy and rear than I had hoped for (they \"pouf\" a bit there). Also, the legs are shaped like a wide peg (like a \"jogger\" style pant leg) that is more pronounced because of the band of elastic at the cuff. I didn't take off a star for the leg shape because the seller clearly describes the shape and elastic in the cuff--I just wish the elastic were either not there or looser. If I were 2 inches taller, perhaps the shape would fall better--not the pants' fault. If I had ordered a M maybe, just maybe, the look would be more slender, but although the pants are very nice, at $35 I'm going to think hard before ordering another pair. If the price is not an issue for you and you fall clearly within one size, then these real linen pants are worth ordering more than one pair.",

They look casual but chic and are comfortable. At this point I have purchased three for myself, couple for my mom and one for my sister. For one of the colors the size was off compared to the rest. When contacted the seller was polite, prompt and helped resolve the issue. They are unlikely to last for more then a summer or two but that\u2019s okay since most of the linen pants I have don\u2019t last much longer then that. I have worn one of them half a dozen times already this summer and they still look okay. Would absolutely recommend it!",
