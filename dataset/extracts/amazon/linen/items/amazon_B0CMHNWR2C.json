                "reviewText": "Can't put my finger on the type of fabric feel this is.. kinda linen with a cotton feel. It is well made, Traditionally a size large it fit just fine.. I think I would like it more if \"I\" was a medium or small however but haven't been for thirty years. That said I needed something nicer than my barn clothes that rarely match and really shouldn't be worn in town as we are taking a cruise to the Caribbean for a retirement bucket list trip.This is out of my normal comfort zone and style is something I don't have so not my wheelhouse. I can tell you it feels nice, fits well, and my family loves it on me and by the end of our trip I think it will be a favorite. I love the buttons that go down the back - nice touch. I put the shirt on first and was like oh no, gonna have some belly showing but once I got the high waisted pants on I was good. Pants are comfy and the shirt sits really cute as it waves out a bit and slims me down (much appreciated).It is well made, stitching is nice, pockets lay flat.. you can get away with suitcase wrinkles with this too. Glad I got it.. it will be nice to have the proper cruise attire with an added confidence of a flattering fit!!",

                "reviewText": "I selected these primarily for the pants, based on previous reviews that indicated the top was a little cropped. I was pleasantly surprised and very pleased when it arrived, because the top was not short, in my opinion. Overall true to size.This is a great casual outfit that can be worn with flat sandals or heeled sandals. The length is versatile enough to work either way.I found the waist to be comfortable. It isn't so loose that it falls down but it isn't so tight that I am creating sausage rolls. I feel I have wiggle room either way (though I always prefer my waist get smaller!) and would still have breathing room. I am 5'7\" and the inseam was just perfect for either type of shoe described above. Pockets are always a plus and they do lay flat.The top is long enough to cover the waist of the pants. The bust was true to size. I ordered a large in this outfit and my bust is 36D. It does not create that horizontal pull line that indents the girls halfway up. The arm holes had sufficient coverage so it wasn't showing my bra, but I could move freely and did not feel like the seam was up in my armpit.Color is a preference thing, but the hue was what I expected when I ordered rust.Linen is a forgiving fabric and that is always a plus. The weight is just right and it is not scratchy and while I will no doubt wear underthings of the same or similar color family, I did not feel the fabric will show through I don't get the colors just right.I like that this can be worn as a complete outfit without looking too matchy/matchy overwhelming, but the pieces can also be separated and worn with others tops and bottoms.This fit free and flowy and just looks easy!Recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I tried this on & loved it: it\u2019s flowy, easy to wear, & has pockets - win!(I took pics before steaming & you will DEFINITELY need to plan some steaming time because it comes super wrinkled.)Then I put my hands in the pockets & one of them has a hole!Like it was never sewn? It\u2019s the right side where I always keep my phone, so that\u2019s a bummer because the weight of the phone will only make it bigger.Yes - someone with sewing skills could stitch this up, but I don\u2019t have such skills! And you shouldn\u2019t have to\u2026Upon further inspection, I noticed 2 dark spots across the waistband. Not the end of the world but, again, they shouldn\u2019t be there.Maybe this was a return, maybe it\u2019s a quality control miss.Either way, not cool.[SIZE INFORMATION]:==I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d, 127 lbs, 36B, & wear size Medium & 8/10. I ordered this in a Medium & it\u2019s the right size.==The pants are elastic across the back, so lots of size range. They\u2019re fairly loose on me but they stay up.==The length just touches the top of my foot but I think it\u2019s because the pants sit kind of low. If the pants stayed on my waist, they\u2019d end at my ankles.==The top fits just right on me. Anyone larger busted may have some tightness across there, though.==The Gray Blue is a really pretty shade & true to what I see on the listing.Bottom line? The cute, casual look of this outfit makes up for the flaws.There\u2019s lots of great color choices & I would consider ordering another one, even with the unsewn pocket & little stains!**Thank you for reading this review & I hope that it\u2019s Helpful!** \ud83d\ude0a",

                "reviewText": "The fabric on this set is soft and drapes beautifully. The color is really pretty and I'm happy it's washable and will be lightweight enough for summer. The styling is classic and appropriate for the beach, to eat at a casual restaurant, to go to events and festivals, etc without being too dressy. It's just a classic, versatile style. It's comfortable and cute and can easily be dressed up or down and worn with differing shoe options depending on what look you are going for.That said, the sizing, for me, was off a little from the top to the pants. The pants fit exactly as expected. The top however, was on the slim and short side. So I'd advise that you check measurements very carefully before choosing. The fabric will likely relax/stretch a bit as this is worn more, but I would take that into account as well as the exact measurements first.",

The material is really nice, I tried to see if I can capture the quality of the fabric in the picture. My mom mentioned it felt really nice wearing this, it was light and not too sheer. This looks really good on her as I mentioned because she's tall and thin. Perfect outfit for Hawaii.",
