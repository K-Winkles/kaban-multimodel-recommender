Great material, love the flow of them and one of the reasons that drew me to them, is they have this big belt that when you tie it, it hides that pooch I have , like a second stomach & I hate it, but with these that bow does a pretty good job of hiding it, which allows me to be able to tuck my blouses & T-shirts in! I can't do that with any of my other pants, it makes it look so much nicer to wear a jacket & Etc. instead of looking unkept & sloppy trying to hide that extra stomach I can't get rid of no matter what I do. I guess you call it a \"fupa\" and they are a great price, I bought 3 and want more, actually all of them if I could \ud83c\udf3a",

                "reviewText": "These pants fit really comfortably and they have that nice flowy feel with the cute tie waist. The blue color is also cute. I can see myself wearing them more in spring and summer when it warms up since the fabric is thin, but I love that flowy style when the weather is warm. I am tall- 5' 9\" and these were actually long enough on me, which is always hard to find in wide leg pants. I also have a musclar rear from squatting and these pants work for that- so if you have some shape- sometimes pants like this are cut for ladies without a shapely rear but these ones have ample room in the butt/hips. The elastic pull on style is also well-liked by me- cute and comfy enough to wear to work and also to wear casually on a weekend. I wash ion cold and hang dry immediately- I can't speak to how they'd hold up in the dryer because I try to maintain length on my pants due to my height.",
