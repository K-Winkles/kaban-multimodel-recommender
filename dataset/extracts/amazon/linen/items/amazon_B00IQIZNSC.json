                "reviewText": "Ordered a small and fit perfectly in the waist with just the right amount of xtra room for comfort but the legs were really long so those will need to be hemmed. However, there is a bigger problem. After wearing the pants for a couple of hours, I started to realize the fabric was rather itchy. I really love these pants, esp. cuz they are low-waisted! I luv em & really wanna keep em so I'm figuring out a way to sew a lightweight inner liner using nylon fabric so my skin doesnt touch the fabric. Quite a pain but thats how much I love these pants. Be aware of the itchy fabric, especially if your skin is sensitive.*Edit Found shorts that are a very light nylon fabric to wear under the pants so my skin wouldnt touch the itch fabric but the pants are still too itchy. Just can't do it. Unfortunately, I have to return. So so sad. Its hard for me to find pants I really love! If the company would change the fabric to 50/50 cotton/linen, these pants would rock! I'd buy one in every color. :)",

While the Roxy Oceanside pant was otherwise nice, the fit was *weird*! The leg length was fine, the material looked nice. BUT! The crotch was so short that the waist barely came up to my butt crack (sorry! but true). This was not a \"hip hugger\" style--and even if it were it was still way too short. A real problem as I so short-waisted that I frequently have to take up pants at the waistband. Weird fit is often a problem with Chinese based companies. Sometimes they're great. Othertimes they slap a size label on and ship it. This time seemed to be the latter.",

                "reviewText": "I love them. Stone color is beautiful. Perfect linen pant if you are petite rise normally or have thin, straight hips.Great tailoring, lovely seams, but it is made very low rise and form fitting through the hips without stretch. Material is good - \u201clinen thin\u201d (a bit see through - must skin match bikini). This form fits (not loose baggy) but looks very nice when it fits.This is not for people with a long waist or very curvy unless you really size up. Also, be prepared to hem if you aren\u2019t very tall.If you do not have a short waist, this will be VERY low. I fit petite and it is a nice low on me. The way they elasticize the top prevents \u201cplumber pants\u201d when you bend, but it fits about at your bikini line -even with a short waist- if you have curves. If you are stick thin and straight all the way down, this fits like on the models. The more curve you have, the lower and tighter it goes.For size, use same size as your form-fitted, tailored zipper pants- maybe even up a size. The elastic waist is purely to accommodate you when you bend. This is not a baggy, loose pull-on (even though it pulls on comfortably .) I imagine even the XXL will not accommodate above a size 12/14.Hope this is helpful!",

I was hesitant to buy because of the \"junior\" in the title but they are long enough and fit great, I sized up to a Large to make sure the length was there but I could have stuck to the medium.
