                "reviewText": "The Perry Ellis 100% Linen Drawstring Casual Pants for Men have completely impressed me with their unbeatable combination of comfort, style, and quality. These pants have quickly become a wardrobe staple, and here's why I'm so thrilled with them: Breathable Linen Fabric: The 100% linen fabric is a game-changer, especially in warm weather. It keeps me cool and comfortable even on the hottest days. The breathability is unmatched, making these pants perfect for summer. Regular Fit Perfection: The regular fit strikes a perfect balance between comfort and style. These pants are neither too baggy nor too tight, making them suitable for a variety of occasions, from casual outings to semi-formal events. Wide Range of Sizes: The availability of waist sizes ranging from 29 to 54, including Big & Tall options, is highly commendable. It ensures that men of all body types can find the perfect fit. Drawstring Waist: The drawstring waist not only adds a touch of casual flair but also provides adjustability for a customized fit. It's a thoughtful feature that I appreciate. Lightweight and Travel-Friendly: These pants are incredibly lightweight, making them an excellent choice for travel. They take up minimal space in a suitcase and are easy to pack and unpack. Classic Style: The classic design and versatile color options make these pants a go-to choice for a range of occasions. They can be dressed up with a button-down shirt or dressed down with a casual tee. Quality Construction: The pants are well-constructed and feel durable. The attention to detail in stitching and finishing ensures they can withstand regular wear. Easy Care: Linen can sometimes be seen as high-maintenance, but these pants are surprisingly easy to care for. They wash well and don't require excessive ironing. Affordable Luxury: Considering the quality and style of these pants, they offer excellent value for the price.

                "reviewText": "I have always been skeptical when ordering clothes on line.I was looking for a summer weight (linen) casual pair of slacks and came across several marketplace sellers.I decided to go with one pr. from each of the better names (knowing that the manufacturing was outside of U.S). OF the two pair the PERRY ELLIS pant was far superior in fit ,style and material.Linen is a great look for summer casual .These slacks will be worn for my summer touring and casual dining . They are advertised as beach pants but they are much more. I dont think I would throw this on to cover a dried out pair of swim suit. Rather wear them to the bar at poolside or a restaurant by the ocean. This pair is tied in front with a draw string but also has belt loops (which some may prefer) which I would not attempt to use as it takes away from casual look. I went with the natural (straw) color so I could have more if a selection of tops. I am right about that knowing whats in my closet...... My only concern with any linen or cotton clothing is \" what will happen when cleaned (shrinkage). All linen and pure cotton clothing is advisable to hand wash in cool water , hang dry and iron at cool setting. I have not had the opportunity as of this evaluation to clean this garment. But I will follow the directions and hope for the best. Please note that I am on the thin side and feel these slacks are almost a perfect fit for a summer slacks which follow my contour and are not tight but feel very comfortable.If I find that after a cleaning a size change such as shrinkage or thread wear occurs I will add this to my evaluation.I know I will enjoy this pair up to and hopefully after it's first cleaning.",

Waist runs 1 inch large and a 33W fit perfectly. Waist is 18 inches across, measured.3. They are not see through, a typical looser linen weave. They are linen slacks...4. Given #3 above, extremely comfortable.5. These have a 4 button fly. NO zipper. 4 buttons.Some reviews gripe a bit about the button fly. In my 20's & 30's used to wear Levis 501 button fly jeans. My old Navy dress whites had button flies. Therefore, I do not find the button fly on these slacks \"odd\", \"strange\", or \"difficult\". I rather like the idea of the vintage look/feel, and 4 chances to say, \"No\". Order them.",
