                "reviewText": "This is a perfect 2 piece summer set. I have 43\u201d bust and 33\u201d waist, and the size large fits me perfectly. This is a very good transitional option while trying to lose weight. I didn\u2019t want to invest on an expensive set when I\u2019m probably going to wear this two or three times. The stitching is done nicely and it\u2019s nice that the waistcoat is lined. I did not see any loose buttons and the structure seems to be well balanced. I\u2019m hoping this set won\u2019t be sticking to the skin under hot humid weather. I\u2019m thinking about purchasing another set in different color. My only wish is that the waistcoat is a bit shorter in order to elongate the bottom portion.",

                "reviewText": "Hi, it\u2019s Glamorous Gem, hope you all are having a wonderful day,Anyway, I don\u2019t have too many outfits like this and it seemed highly interesting. So, why not?This set is fairly simple and seems quite like Spring/Summer Attire. It has a no sleeve vest with a v-neck(that isn\u2019t too revealing) and comes with shorts with an elastic banding.This outfit made out of 51%Polyester,46%Viscose,3%Elastane. It has a suit like feeling material on the outside and soft fabric on the inside. Not only is the fabric look appealing, it seems quite strong, durable, and it\u2019s stretchy. So, that comes in handy for those that need a bit of extra room.As for size, it fit me perfectly. I did check in a previous post about it being \u201csmall\u201d, but I\u2019m glad I listened to my own mind. Be sure to order your true sizing, it is very accurate. Not only does it fit me well, but it seems to be roomy/slim fitting as well. It\u2019s not too tight or too loose. I instantly loved the style on me. I\u2019m about 5\u20190, 210, and have around a 34-36 waist. So, a 1X was just fine.So, this can be a day to day outfit, or be suitable for casual endeavors as well. Either or, it\u2019s gender neutral, accommodating, versatile, dynamic, great for upcoming warm weather, and has a very attractive styling. I absolutely love it. 5/5PS: No matter the nature, I only write honest, unbiased, and authentic reviews. Thanks for reading\u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\udcd6",

I am a full 34b and had trouble buttoning the top button in the size Small. If you have a larger bust, I would size up. The shorts fit perfectly! Good length and two side pockets give a tailored, put together look. I like that you can mix and match the top and bottoms giving you multiple uses. I would purchase in other colors. I recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This is such an easy breezy outfit - like another reviewer, I\u2019m honestly surprised at how much I love this. It\u2019s so comfortable and the fact both pieces are lined has a lot to do with that. The fiber content of the lining feels so smooth, silky and cool on my skin. It also allows the fabric to drape as nicely as it does. I\u2019m 5\u20195,\u201d 165lbs, 38C, 34\u201d waist, 44\u201d hips and I ordered this in XL. It runs a bit big, but I wanted a loose fit. I especially did not want the waist to be too snug, which it isn\u2019t. The armholes dip low, so I need to be mindful of what type of bra, or mostly likely bralette, I wear underneath.I\u2019m really looking forward to sporting these pieces individually. I think the vest will look awesome with white linen slacks, a strappy cami and pointed flats or mules. Or some barrel jeans, a concert tee will be nice. In addition, I have a hack for the vest on days I want a more fitted look. I can take a brooch to gather some of the fabric, in the back, by my waistline. I like everything about this outfit, from the buttons to the roomy pockets of the shorts. I ordered this in the apricot shade, and the buttons coordinate so nicely. I do recommend going by the size guide as it\u2019s fairly accurate. And I definitely recommend this versatile outfit. This brand, PrettyGarden, also has an Amazon store.",

                "reviewText": "This two piece set is super cute and I feel can be pretty versatile depending on the look you\u2019re going for. I ordered a large and it\u2019s true to size; it\u2019s a little baggier on me than I would have liked BUT that\u2019s because I\u2019ve lost about 7lbs since I ordered it originally so the fit is most likely due to that and not the product. The shorts are high waisted and sit comfortably above my belly button while still letting the shorts hit mid to low thigh, making them a professional length if someone were to wear them to an office or work function. The top fits nicely and I don\u2019t feel the next to have to wear a shirt or cami under it to feel comfortable or covered so that\u2019s nice. I love the green color and it matches the product description photos. Can pair with flats, heels or wedges to take the look from office to brunch to date night out.",

                "reviewText": "This is one of those outfits that I was hesitant to grab but that surprised me with how comfortable, adorable and cute the style is. You can wear a bra or bralette under the vest top, or just whatever you\u2019re comfy with. The sizing is true to size but I\u2019m smaller up top so I have a little wiggle room and that actually is really nice and makes it more comfortable. The inside vest lining is SOFT and feels amazing. It looks like a really modern hip style outfit and is so versatile, so comfortable and really feels effortless to pair and make a nice presentable outfit that\u2019s easy to throw on. Also, it can be upstyled so many ways and can be so simply paired together - I love how many options and ways there are to wear it. It\u2019s absolutely a staple and I adore it!!!",
