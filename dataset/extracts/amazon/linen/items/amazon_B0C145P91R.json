                "reviewText": "I recently added a pair of dark camel linen pants to my wardrobe, and despite a minor hiccup in the laundry department, these bottoms have quickly become a favorite. The initial love affair began with the impeccable fit, flattering silhouette, and the delightful inclusion of pockets \u2013 a real game-changer.The fit is nothing short of perfection. The pants hug in all the right places without feeling restrictive, and the slightly oversized design adds a touch of laid-back comfort. The flattering cut enhances my silhouette, making these linen wonders my go-to choice for both casual outings and more polished affairs.Now, onto the accidental laundry misadventure. Despite my usual commitment to air-drying, these pants found themselves in the clutches of the dryer. To my dismay, they emerged a good 3+ inches shorter. Panic aside, the silver lining was the initial oversized fit \u2013 a savior that allowed me room for this unexpected mishap.What could have been a major fashion tragedy turned out to be a minor inconvenience. The pants, now slightly cropped, surprisingly retained their chic look and comfort. The linen material gracefully adapted to the change, maintaining its quality and feel.I'm relieved to report that, even after the unintentional encounter with the dryer, my love for these linen pants has only deepened. They remain a wardrobe staple, and I've learned to embrace their new cropped charm. A testament to their durability and timeless style, these pants have proven that a small laundry blunder doesn't have to spell the end for a well-loved piece.In conclusion, these dark camel linen pants are a wardrobe win. From the initial flawless fit to the accidental shrinkage and subsequent adaptation, they've earned their place as a versatile and resilient favorite. If you're on the hunt for stylish, comfortable, and forgiving linen pants, these are the ones to snag \u2013 just be sure to keep them out of the dryer!",

                "reviewText": "It\u2019s now October and I have been wearing these pants (plus I bought a beige pair) all summer. They were perfect! Comfortable and cool but also provided a chic and casual look. They have maintained their quality and aren\u2019t showing any wear. I just bought a pair in black for Fall. Definitely recommend.I have been looking for some cute and casual pants I can wear during this coming summer. I ordered the teal in small and I\u2019m happy with them out of the packaging. I think these will work well for what I want from them. They fit great (nice and loose without looking too baggy). The length is just right for wearing sandals or flats. The fabric is light and breathable without feeling too cheap or flimsy. The teal color is more of a denim blue than teal. I was a little disappointed with the color difference (wanted a more green teal like the photo) but when I put them on my boyfriend immediately complemented me on the color (he loves blue). It\u2019s a nice neutral blue that will go with a lot of tops. For sizing reference, I am 5\u20196\u201d, 117 lbs and usually wear a small. They fit true to size. I would recommend and may purchase another color. I haven\u2019t washed them yet. I will update if they shrink or fall apart after a few washes.",

                "reviewText": "I would\u2019ve given it five stars but they really do shrink if you put them in the dryer .I\u2019m gonna order a second pair because they\u2019re so comfy. I\u2019ll just be more cautious when laundering moving forward.That being said, my first pair , I ordered in an extra large, and so as they have shrunk, they still fit. Before I washed them, as I was walking up the stairs I had to be careful to kind of lift the leg or I could step on the cuff and trip. Now they\u2019re a little at the ankle with one time going through the dryer, but they still fit very comfortably around the waist, the hip, the butt,.Even though I could get away with a large, I will still order an extra large again, because the comfort was really pajama like, and if I accidentally threw them into the dryer again, I know they\u2019ll still fit, but they\u2019ll just be shorter. It\u2019s odd that the rest of it must\u2019ve shrunk, but it still fits very comfortably.These pants are well-made. They\u2019re fun and comfortable and cute. A great alternative to shorts during the hot summer months easily dressed up or just with a cute tank top and very casual flip-flops.I\u2019m not sure how to really explain how unbelievably comfortable they are how, it\u2019s like getting away with wearing pajamas in public that are really flattering and cute.",
