The top is short but for an average torso length the fit is good, I can raise my arms and not show skin. The ruffle on the bottom is not too much- just a nice touch. The pants fit well- not too loose and baggy, a nice fit on the hips and then a natural flow down from there. I love the color, the teal grey- a great alternative to my usual black.",

                "reviewText": "I am a super picky person who does not shop clothing on Amazon - until now. I happened across this two piece set and loved the look. Read through reviews and decided to give it a try. Recently spent a fortune on a very fancy website for clothing for a vacation. Wish I had seen these products before that.This set is super cute and truly well made. The fabric is just right - substantial enough to last and won't be flimsy and see through but cool and comfortable on a hot day. I am usually a small but sized up to medium considering the possibility of some shrinkage after laundering. The top definitely runs a bit smaller than the pants. Still, I love it! Laundered on delicate cycle and dried on very low heat for a short time then hanged to finish drying - perfect!",

I got lots of compliments the first time I wore it. After hand washing with cold ish water, it shrunk quite a bit. The pants fit a little snug in the hip area but it wasn\u2019t too bad, but the top shrunk a considerable amount and is more like a mid drift top that is now tight in the arm openings. If I was basing my review off of the first time I wore it I would give it a 5/5. But after putting it on a second time I would give it a 2/5( I actually ended up taking it off because I no longer felt comfortable nor cute in it)",

                "reviewText": "First of all, this set is very cute. The material is not too thin or thick although it felt light and airy in 107 degree weather. I machine washed them in cold water in gentle cycle and shaped them before hanging them to dry. The washing did not shrink them and they fit the same as it did before washing. I didn\u2019t have to iron or steam them before wearing them. My biggest concern when purchasing this set was whether the top will fit around my bust since many clothing items are hit or miss when ordering through Amazon. Around my bust measures 42\u201d and the large size fits just right. My bottom is one size smaller than the top so I wish that the top and the bottom could be purchased separately. I\u2019m still happy with the purchase and I\u2019ve ordered another set in different color.",

I purchased this because I loved the color, the cute ruffles, and the material was perfect for warmer weather. And I was nervous to purchase because I have a fuller bust and thighs. BUT it fit perfectly! I got an XL and I am normally a 14/16 so the fit was as I expected. The material had a little bit of give too, which was nice. And it was not sheer at all to where I had to worry about what underwear color I was wearing. I cannot wait to wear again next year!",

Both the waist and the bust are tight. But it\u2019s super cute on. The blue grey is more green grey to my eyes, but it\u2019s very flattering with my paler skin and lighter eyes. Love the pockets! Only complaint: my label says linen rayon blend, so I ironed it at the rayon setting. The material did that thing where it gets lighter and shinier after ironing at too high a temperature (even though I ironed it at the temperature recommended for the more heat sensitive fabric). So that bummed me out a bit, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ruined so I\u2019m keeping it.",
