The cloth is not flimsy , it\u2019s soft and I love the fit , I\u2019m 5 fit , about 130 lbs , I got the small , and the fit is just right , not too loose , just right. The length is about 3 inches longer than my ideal length but this can easily be sewed up . I\u2019m actually getting another color, getting ready for summer already . Highly recommend , you get your money\u2019s worth !",

Wore these to amusement park and they were light and comfortable. I wash and air dry which has kept them in great shape. The length was not good for my daughter who is almost 5\u201911. They were too short but she rolled up a few times to make capri and it looked cute, but she really wanted full length so taller ladies should keep this in mind.",

                "reviewText": "These are lovely pants. Material seems to be decent, stitching is good. The only problem is the sizing. I initially ordered a L based on the sizing guide. I am size 8 in most bottoms. The L was waaaay too big.. So I returned and ordered M. The M fit well throughout the legs, but the waist, crotch and seat area seemed too snug. Not very noticeable, but not sure if it'd be comfortable for me, especially during hot weather. I will have to return.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this pair of linen slacks for a trip to Abu Dhabi. There are modesty rules for certain sites that require coverage to ankles (and wrists). These linen pants felt ideal as temperatures in the region challenge the mercury and the air conditioning is arctic.I sized up based in comments and availability and wish I had not. All bodies carry weight differently; so this may not be true for all body types. I found the pants to have ample room in legs, rear and waist. I am glad there is a functional drawstring, I found I was constantly adjusting the waist. While the material boasts no stretch, the linen fiber did relax. It may be attributed to the steamy climate but I was delighted the pants did not wrinkle from wear.I am 5\u20192\u201d and found the pants required a hem to wear with flat sandals or sneakers. I don\u2019t sew and how no time to learn so I used a fabric fusing tape. This worked well and withstood washing.",
