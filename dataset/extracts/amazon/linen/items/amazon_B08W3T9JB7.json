                "reviewText": "After following Caralyn for some time, I decided to take the plunge and try these jumpsuits. Being a curvy woman it is sometimes difficult to find stylish, comfortable and versatile pieces that are both worth the money and can take you from brunch to business and out for a night on the town. These jumpsuits are amazing. I have worn them alone, with a denim jacket for a more casual look and I've also worn them with a blazer. I also purchased the Navy color and wore it to my son's graduation from Navy Nuclear school in South Carolina. I have worn these two rompers/jumpsuits more than any other item in my closet this summer. I'm a 14/16, with 38DDD bust and purchased the XL. Fit perfectly. I love the hidden snap a the bustline. I appreciate the quality fabric choice as it is not so thin that your underwear can show through and the weight is perfect for taking you through spring/summer/fall. This pairs nicely with sandals, heels or sneakers. I was hesitant about the cost but now that I have worn them so much- I will never hesitate again. Thank you Caralyn and Amazon! I hope you come out with more colors in the future (like black !)",

                "reviewText": "Ugh. This jumpsuit has given me so much grief! I had a reminder set on my phone for when this dropped- I was not going to miss out on it! Initially ordered the blue and green in multiple sizes to be sure I had the best fit. The blue jumpsuit in size large was at least 4 inches shorter than any of the others (including the green in large, and both colors in medium), rode up in the crotch and back, and just didn\u2019t sit well. It was absolutely not the same cut or sizing as the others- something was off in production. I DMed CMK and sent pics, said she\u2019d touch base with the Drop team and find something out. Never heard back. I returned them all and waited patiently for another blue in size large to become available. Second blue size large comes in the mail. Imagine my disappointment when I try it on and one leg is an inch or so shorter than the other. It was a noticeable difference, especially with shoes on. Ugh. I just got my third one in, and it seems to be right this time around. I think some QC was missed on a few of these. That being said, when it\u2019s right- it\u2019s RIGHT. Gorgeous and flattering on curves. Very happy I finally got a good one, but what a pain it was to get it.",

It\u2019s thick without being too hot or stiff and looks very nice and professional. I am a size 22 in most jeans/pants, a size 2X in dresses, and a 42F so I ordered a 3X. It was a little loose around the bust but fit perfectly with a shirt layered underneath. Otherwise a really good fit!",

The fabric is thicker than the pic makes it look (it is NOT thin and silky aka \u201ccheap\u201d). It is a very soft, good quality, thick Jersey. The seaming is all very solid. I\u2019m very happy with the quality. I am 5\u20192\u201d (125 lb) and expected to need to hem. You can see in the pic it is perfect with my wedge sandals. And how much too long it is when barefoot. For the price, it is an amazing value even if a hem is needed.",
