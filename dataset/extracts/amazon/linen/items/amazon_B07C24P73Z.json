                "reviewText": "I am a size medium. 5'8\" 160 lbs. average build.I initially ordered this shirt extra-large (up-sizing by 2), thinking that these shirts generally run a bit on the small size. The extra-large was indeed extra-large! It felt like one of those wing suits. I immediately returned it. (open your package carefully, just in case you need to return it) I returned the item at my local Kohl's (Amazon drop-off) with absolutely zero hassle!I re-ordered the shirt size large (up-size by 1) and received it the very next day. I put it on and loved the loose fit. Fearing that there would be a shrinkage issue, I immediately hand washed it. Gentle hand wash with some liquid detergent and rinse in COLD water. I squeezed out the excess water after a rinse and hung on a PLASTIC hanger outside. Forty-five minutes later, it was dry. I gave it a once over with a MEDIUM HEAT iron. There was ZERO shrinkage.So in summary. Buy this shirt one size larger than your normal fit. HAND WASH ONLY in COLD water and AIR DRY. DO NOT PUT IN DRYER. Iron lightly to remove wrinkles.A great loose fitting garment that looks sharp.I have already ordered the other colors.",

                "reviewText": "I've purchased linen Heley shirts before and they are one of my favorite styles. However, these shirts are much smaller than the ones I'd purchased previously (by Nitagut), and different materialI ordered both xx and xxx to see which was best fit. Unfortunately, the xxx I received was smaller than the Nitagut xx shirt, and the sleeves only came down to the middle of my forearm.Also, the Nitagut material was sturdier and felt more comfortable. Though they say these shirts are linen, they are actually a blend of 75% cotton and 25% flax. Flax is the plant that linen comes from, but it's not clear if flax is processed the same way as linenThe Nitagut shirts I like are also a blend, but they are 45% cotton and 55% linen (not flax).FYI, the seller charges for shipping if you return the item - they deduct it from your refund.",
