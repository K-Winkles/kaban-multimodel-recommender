                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Very nice pants. I purchased the \u201cDark Yellow\u201d in a size 12. I have gained a lot of weight in the last 3 months. I used to be a size small or a size 4, just 3 months ago. I am trying to lose the 40 lbs I put on however, it\u2019s slower to come off then it was to put it on!! I wasn\u2019t sure what size to get but opted to try the 12. They fit very well. I am slowly losing weight so I\u2019m sure in a couple weeks they\u2019ll loosen more, as they are a tad snug. I am 5\u20193\u201d inches tall, and weigh 165 lbs. these pants don\u2019t stretch much at all, if any. They\u2019re 97% Cotton and 3% Elastane. If you\u2019re worried of them being too tight, size up. I have a short torso and they are a mid to high rise on me. Those with a longer torso may find they\u2019re a mid rise. They come folded twice at the ankle. I unfolded them for washing but will definitely re-fold once dry. My button threading came loose and as I pulled on the loose thread it completely unraveled and I had to re sew the button back on. No big deal. They are a true jean material however, seem dressier than your typical jean. I love that they have deep front pockets and smaller back pockets that just have a simple slit at the top. The same as some dress pants might have. In my opinion it seems to help shape the booty better than just a flat solid material in the rear. If that makes sense. For color reference, the earrings laying on the jeans in my video are a bright yellow mustard color. The pants are more the brown spicy mustard color, or Gold without any sparkle.",

I\u2019ve spend hundreds of dollars on famous brands and these look just as good, wash well, and can be dressed up or down. I\u2019ve already ordered five pairs and think these are a bargain. If they came in a wider variety of colors I would order them as well. These are a spectacular deal. Amazon Essentials have really upped their game.",

I have pairs from Eddie Bauer, Loft, Tommy Hilfiger, so many that I have settled on. I found these on Amazon and for the price I said \"why not?\". I am so glad I did. I am 5'7\", so not short, but it's all torso. So pants are always too long. These fit perfect! perfect in the waist, length, rise. I love them so much I purchased 4 colors and will buy more. they do wrinkle a bit because they are cotton. So I wash them, hang them, and use my hands to press them flat, and let them air dry. Put them on and the little bit of stretch makes any wrinkles disappear. They are easy care. I pair them with T-shirts, blouses with blazers, you name it. Super versatile. I just hope they don't change their design on these as they fit as if they were tailored for me. And with this price... try them! I find them true to size and no shrinking in the wash.",

                "reviewText": "I was thrilled to read the inseam measurements and find I don't need to shorten these pants. They are meant to be capris, but I am short, with a short inseam, so they work perfectly for me as full-length trousers. The company I used to order from switched to using denim instead of a softer, lighter fabric, so I was glad to find these. The only complaints I have are regarding the cuffs and the noise the fabric makes when I walk. The cuffs are not properly made. Instead of having a deep hem that is then turned up so the interior seam isn't visible, they have a basic hem that is turned up and not tacked to stay in place. The result is that it just looks like someone rolled up their pants legs. It's a sloppy look. The fabric is soft against the skin, but makes a stiff noise when I walk, like the sound of parachute fabric being pulled and pushed by school children in gym class. The size is generous, so you might order a smaller size than you expect if you refer to the size chart. I ordered according to the chart and my measurements, and the trousers were too loose. I ordered the next size down; they were still too loose. Third try was the charm.",
