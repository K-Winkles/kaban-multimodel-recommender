The inseam is a bit too long for my short legs, but that\u2019s a minor concern.The pants breathe nicely, and don\u2019t wrinkle as much as I expected. They worked great for a recent beach trip, with temps and humidity in the 80\u2019s. They were comfortable the entire time. I\u2019m picking up another pair for travel.",

That said, I bought two more pairs in other colors after wearing these twice.",
