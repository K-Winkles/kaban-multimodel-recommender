Two detractors- it is VERY long (as in both arms and legs). Arms go past my wrists and the pants fully drag on the ground unless I pull the waist up to my boobs. For reference I am 5\u20197 with pretty long legs.The white is also quite see through. Even nude underwear shows through the bottoms. Gotta go commando if you\u2019re not wearing the shirt fully down.Aside from that I love it and it\u2019s very luxurious. I\u2019ll be ordering more colors.",

I will say, the fabric is super, super stretchy and it feels great against my skin. The length was perfect considering I am a tall woman. 5\u20197\u201d to be exact. 245lbs. Tried to add a belt to see if that would help. It didn\u2019t. The only 2 things I did not like was the collar & no pockets! I could not get past how awkward the collar looks. It messed the entire outfit up. And, no pockets are a deal breaker these days. I really need pockets on all of my pants if I\u2019m not wearing a sweater cardigan or jacket with pockets. Unfortunately, returned\u2026",

I ordered an XL for an oversized look. If I wanted a more fitted look, I know for sure a large would\u2019ve done the trick.The pants are a bit long which I don\u2019t mind because I plan on wearing chunky sneakers.The material is light and breathable. I ordered the set in black and it looks and feels like it\u2019s good quality.You can definitely dress it up with heels or down with sneakers.I will be ordering a few more in other colors.",

The material is wonderful very flexible and not tight, see thru or stiff. The color is vibrant. Would definitely get another color to wear around at an in home function. It was perfect for Christmas as family stopped by to open gifts and have dinner. Felt like pjs but kicked up a notch.",

The material was completely see through and had a tonne of loose threading throughout the top and legs. When i went to return it the cost of shipping was more than the cost of the item.
