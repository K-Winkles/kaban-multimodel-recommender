                "reviewText": "All, WAYYYYY too often, I am SO disappointed by Amazon clothing, but not this time! It fits really well. I got the 2XL. I have a big tummy (hence the tunics), I'm 5'8 and weigh 200 lbs and wear a 38DDD bra. I have a large frame. My shoulders are broad for a woman, and let's not even talk about wrists and hands. This fits me perfectly. I think if you have a slight frame, even if you have the same build, you may want to go down one size. I could prob wear a 1x but I like things comfy and loose.The color (mustard) is gorgeous. Not too yellow, not too tan. It is an earth-tone kind of yellow.The best part is the material. There is NO stretchy spandex-y, satin-y, feel about it. This baby feels like cool percale sheets with some linen thrown in but not too scratchy. You can't keep this balled up in a corner and expect to shake it out, it's definitely going to wrinkle, but this is the material I was really hoping it would be.It's nice and thin so it will dry quickly if I sweat this summer in HOTlanta, Georgia. It is not sheer, however. I may add some pics later but can't right now. Im on a laptop. I love the curve of the buttons too. It makes it much more interesting. You can't un-button; show only. I love everything about this shirt. It covers my tummy and will look great with jeans or a cotton loose pair of drawstring pants.",

The sleeves are shorter than I expected and it is a bit stiff. Maybe washing will soften it. It looks a bit like scrubs. I changed out the buttons for some unusual ones that contrast and like that better. A good every day summer top.",
