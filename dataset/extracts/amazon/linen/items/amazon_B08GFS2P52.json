                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Very impressed - and I\u2019m not new to linen!",
                "reviewText": "I bought two Full Size Duvets for my 6yr-old and 2yr-old. We currently have all linen bedding for our bed and our guest bed, so when we bought our girls new beds, I knew I wanted to get them each a white linen duvet plus a down comforter insert.The down comforter inserts that I found are awesome! It\u2019s a Canadian brand that I ordered through Amazon and the price was excellent. The only thing is, the double/full size of the down comforter was not a very common size, which meant trouble with finding a duvet cover. I loved it for our kids bed because it didn\u2019t have too much overhang on the sizes - therefore it wasn\u2019t too heavy for them to move around in. So I went searching and found that this product was the ONLY duvet that had the size that matched up with our insert. Although there were some concerning reviews, this is my full assessment after receiving it:-First if all, if you\u2019re getting a full size (or really ANY SIZE for that matter), please LOOK AT THE MEASUREMENTS. I\u2019m pretty sure a lot of these negative reviews regarding the full-size not being the correct size would actually be wiped from existence if the people would\u2019ve actually looked at the size of their insert and the size of the duvet cover. In my case, this was the exact size I needed. My insert was the exact same size as this linen cover and they fit perfectly together. It IS a more uncommon size compared to most others, so just pay attention to sizing and you\u2019ll be fine.- In regards to all the reviews calling it \u201cscratchy\u201d linen, my first question would be if they\u2019ve ever owned anything linen that touches their skin? Any linen Clothes? Bedding? Blankets? If you have and you know what linen is, what linen feels like, and you enjoy the benefits of it being more breathable when it\u2019s hot, yet warm when it\u2019s cold, then I do believe you\u2019re going to be very happy with this product. I\u2019m wondering if all these people calling it \u201cscratchy\u201d are only familiar with the super smooth feeling of polyester or a soft cotton-blend sheet. This is linen, and linen isn\u2019t a silky feel. I can fully understand that it\u2019s not for everyone, but I personally sleep in linen sheets and will never go back. It\u2019s also on my guest bed and I\u2019ve even received compliments from previous skeptics.-Next, this is a very affordable option! Anyone who has searched for linen bedding knows it\u2019s pretty pricey. I spent $900+ from Bed Threads for sheets & duvets with our King bed and our Queen guest bed. With that said, these honestly felt very, very similar right out of the box to my Bed Threads linen and after the first wash. After washing them each with 1/2 cup baking soda, they felt just fine and honestly no different than my Bed Threads set. I hate saying that because I spent so much more on my BT sets, but they look and feel basically identical.-wrinkles? Ha - yes. It\u2019s linen! It has a very natural look and does not look pressed. With that said, the wrinkles are no different than my bed threads linen so I don\u2019t think this is anything against this product. Linen will have wrinkled/rippled look.-In my situation, where I was buying this for my two young kids, I honestly wanted a cheaper option than Bed Threads BUT still wanted linen. I also definitely didn\u2019t want another 2-3 month wait again for shipping from Australia. It was worth it at the time, but man I don\u2019t want to do that again right now. I just want to get something I liked on my kids new down comforters - asap.-My only hesitation is possibly the stitching and how well that\u2019ll hold up, but only time will tell for that. It all seems to be just fine as of right now and each set washed nicely without any issue.-I\u2019m also watching out for this \u201cfuzzy\u201d frenzy that I read about from a few others. Some people mentioned lint everywhere, everyday. Vacuuming up insane amounts.. I believe people all have different experiences, BUT there wasn\u2019t even any crazy amount of lint that came from the dryer\u2019s lint catcher. I had about 5x more lint come from one Turkish towel than both duvets combined. Also, I wear all black about 95% of the time. I always know how bad something will shed because if it touches my leggings it\u2019ll leave a full blown layer of lint if it has a shedding issue. I didn\u2019t the test after taking the sets out of the dryer.. no lint rubbed off on my black leggings. I\u2019d honestly be extremely surprised if random lint started flying out everywhere when I\u2019m not seeing anything at all, but if it does I\u2019ll definitely update.This seems like an excellent option at a very affordable price. I also love the pillow case covers! They\u2019re very pretty and have such a nice relaxed look around the edges, and a standard pillow fills them great. I honestly like them better than my bed threads Euro Shams!Basically, if you want to spend tons of money from another company, I can\u2019t say I blame you. I\u2019ve done it and it was exciting! BUT I\u2019m here to say you definitely don\u2019t HAVE to, especially if you\u2019re trying to stay on a budget or just don\u2019t want to. After getting these, I\u2019d say to trust the positive reviews on here. I\u2019m sure there are these one-off issues that can happen with manufacturing, but if you\u2019re worried about quality I honestly think the quality is on par with the more expensive linens from other companies.",

                "reviewText": "Recently made the switch to linen because my fianc\u00e9 and I are both very hot sleepers but still like the comfort of a duvet. I originally purchased the dark grey color and it\u2019s a nice blue/grey tone. Our puppy chewed it. So I re-ordered and this time decided to go with the Linen color and it\u2019s the perfect neutral tone that could be paired with browns or greys. Linen feels a little scratchy at first but softens up the more you wash it. I\u2019ve washed this twice so far and it\u2019s already become softer and is holding up nicely. Linen is naturally \u201cwrinkly\u201d looking so if you don\u2019t like that textured look you won\u2019t be super satisfied with the look of this duvet cover.",

I live in a tropical climate and needed to change to a cooler duvet cover. I use this with a down comforter and it\u2019s perfect. The only thing I don\u2019t really like about it is the button closures. You have to undo and redo like 20 buttons to insert the duvet, which takes a pretty long time. It does come with a couple extra buttons just in case they come off. But the look of the buttons is cute. It is definitely not wrinkle free, but I think it adds to the rustic look.",

                "reviewText": "This linen is beautiful! I love the white trim along the edges. It is also soft, though not as soft as linen can be. It is also not thin but not super thick.Given that it is linen... there are things to be mindful of. First, linen is low maintenance... meaning, you don't need to use a lot of water/electricity to launder. So, use low dry heat and cold water. I usually take it out of the dryer midway... I just need it damp as linen dries quite fast. Linen also tends to be wrinkly after washing so keep that in mind if you're someone who expects perfection. As I get older, I tend to appreciate this value of wrinkles in linen and with usage, the wrinkles disappear. So the negatives... the case seems to be bigger than needed. This is perhaps to allocate shrinkage. I also think this can be improved by adding a button or zipper on the enclosure or do an envelope style enclosure. As this is bigger... it leaves a gap opening in the back, especially after washing when it tends to be wrinkly. Kinda beats the purpose of having a case. I am still keeping the cases as they are affordable, pretty, since this size is extremely hard to find for linen cases, and it is linen. But, I would consider switching for a case with secured back enclosure if one is available.",
