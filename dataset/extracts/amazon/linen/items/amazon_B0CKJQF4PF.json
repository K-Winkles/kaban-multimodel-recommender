                "reviewText": "I jump at anything with natural (cotton/ linen) materials, & a linen with additional non-linen just says to me it may be less-likely to wear as wrinkly- I will update on that after a wash but just wanted to note the gorgeous (better than photos) color! (& pleasing fit!) Both color & style /material reminds me exactly of pants I had in the 00s :) (Except those didn't have elastic.. I'm not one to typically show off elastic but I got these anyway for longer tops & lounging, for which they're perfect)These definitely look and feel like linen, with the weave and those subtle nubs and wavy/wrinklesHas both elastic, and a fully functional (all way round) drawstring.I'm typically a size small in pants, sometimes xs (varies) 2,4,6, the smallest size available when I grabbed these was Medium. They are super comfortable and look great in the legs, and perfect for wearing as intended (PJ lounge comfy pants, with longer loose baggy top/sweater if I were to wear them *out*Pulled up to my waist they weren't low-crotched or that saggy/baggy, really, as they drape just straight down pretty nicely~ just a bit of extra room in the hip. It's the perfect wide-leg \"straight through hip and thigh\" cut/ look~ I'd buy these again and try (my size) small next time and I'll let you know if the legs on those are not quite as wide as these Medium ones (as I imagine would be the case... so if you're looking for a pretty wide leg, I'd say don't be afraid to give the next size up a try because you might like the drape in the upper portion/ hip area)The elastic is stretchy enough to not be too tight or uncomfortable. It's great for my waist, I don't *need* to use the drawstring, nor are they snug enough for me to be too aware of it/ uncomfortable.I'm 5'4 1/2 and they are the perfect length to me- long enough where they weren't feeling like they're going to shrink up to my ankles/top of my feet, but I wasn't tripping over them either. They just perfectly graze down to the base of my tennis shoes/ just about touching the floor. Perfect for sandals Or something with a bit of a heel.Easy breezy pant, great find, nice classic style in a beautiful/ refreshing terracotta color!",

I feel like they're a good quality and as someone who is 5'7'', I'm really quite happy with how this fit fell on me. A very welcome addition to my wardrobe!",
