Another person wrote that the material is not as soft as she would like, and I have to agree. It\u2019s a slightly heavier cotton, which might be really good because maybe it will last longer. The legs are 4 inches too long so when it shrinks that will be great. I am 5\u20193\u201d and wear a 10. I\u2019s roomy almost too loose.I washed it in the machine on hand, wash, cold water and then hung it to dry. It is no longer 4 inches too long and it fits perfectly instead of very loosely now. I would recommend never ever in the dryer because it shrinks so much just being washed and line dried.",

I'm 5\u20194\u2019\u2019 and 140 lbs give/take and I sized up to a medium after reading about the pant legs being short and I wanted a baggy look. I could\u2019ve gotten away with a size down but the legs would\u2019ve been more like capris. The back is not flattering though so it\u2019s something I\u2019ll have to accept or find a cute belt for. They have two buttons for the shoulder straps too if you want them hanging further down or higher up. Super comfy and stylish. Definitely recommend buying these.",

                "reviewText": "Size XLPros:Beautiful design. Good color pigmentation. Good construction. Fabric is good thickness although it feels thin at first. Worth the $20 if you do need to alter it for a better fit.There are two button rows so it is somewhat height adjustable.Cons: The fabric is somewhat stiff and itchy. The crotch sits low and awkward. The legs are long for short people. If you are 5'5 and you will need it hemmed/cuffed or a shoe with a decent sole if you don't want it dragging on the floor.The sewed on buttons may need some reinforcement so they don't fall off if you choose to wash it. I would wash on cold on the delicate/hand wash cycle with low spin then hang dry to keep from tearing it up or shrinking it. I would only put this on low or no heat in a dryer.I haven't washed it yet. Stay tuned. I ordered an XL just in case. I tried it on over a pair of joggers to make sure it had room to shrink and still fit me. I'm 5'4 1/2 and roughly a size 16 in pants. I'm a 38 D and will need to wear a top.Edit: I washed in cold and tumble dried with no heat. It shrunk. You will need to buy 2 sizes up if you plan to wash this in the machine. The tag (attached on the outside) says dry clean or machine wash but apparently NOT SO. The tag sewn on the inside the pants says dry clean???. So now it fits awkward and fabric is itchy. I'm pear shaped. The legs are now TOO short, crotch still long and since I'm short torso/ bottom heavy it's tighter around my hips and midsection. One button came off also. I can wear it around the house but not outside.",

I washed them and hung to dry. Good thing I didn't put them in the dryer because they shrunk up considerably. They still fit well, with room...just not so baggy. The length also shrank. I now button on the bottom button. They are now a little shorter than I'd like. They are fine with flip flops but with sneakers or sandals with a small heel I would like them longer. I am going to crochet trim on the hem of them to add about 1\". If you want to dry them in the dryer, you might consider buying a size up. I still love them and might buy more. I got lot's of compliments on the orange ones today! Photos are before washing.",

The fabric is not super soft, but not scratchy either. Similar to linen instead of cotton. They\u2019re not a fashion statement, but you just can\u2019t beat them for comfort and durability.",
