However, we have purchased a different duvet cover set by Bedsure and have been very happy with it so I decided to roll the dice on this set. The material is super soft, doesn\u2019t get horribly wrinkly, has beautiful stitching and seems to be great quality. My only possible complaint would be the sand color has a little bit more reddish/pinkish undertones than it shows in the pictures but I\u2019m okay with it. Really glad I made this purchase - highly recommend!",

I will have to keep an eye out for sales so I can try their sheets and maybe more colors in the duvet.

                "reviewText": "I ordered the Queen size for my queen bed, and when you order the size online it days \"queen\" but when you receive the order, the tag says full/Queen. So it's supposed to fit a full and a queen sized bed, but it was a bit small for my queen size. I was better off buying a king for my queen. I've never had this issue before with other bed sheet brands (I usually order from Magnolia) Kinda disappointed, but the sheets are pretty.",

I was very interested in this new brand, but I was hesitant to buy due to the price point. However, the color was perfect for my room and I figured it would be an investment. First, the color is absolutely gorgeous, which I expected. What I didn\u2019t expect was how soft it would be. This is my first linen duvet and I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect, but I absolutely love it. I was also a bit worried that the Queen size would be too big on my 90x90 insert, but it settled very well. Overall, I\u2019m obsessed and excited to see how this holds up over time. I can\u2019t wait to try the other sheets and blankets!",
