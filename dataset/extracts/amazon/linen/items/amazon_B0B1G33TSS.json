When we saw these on a Black Friday deal, we decided to take the plunge and we are happy we did. The package seemed small for our set (Cal King - a hard size to find), but they were just very well packed. Before placing them on the bed, we washed and dried them twice, using the delicate cycle (cold) for the wash and for the dryer. Since I was concerned about the lint, I washed the top sheet and one pillowcase in one load and the fitted sheet with a pillowcase in the other. Turned out to be a good idea because the lint filter was FULL at the end of the first washing, and for the second one as well. We have washed them several times since, and the lint volume has decreased significantly. They fit on our mattress (11-inch), but they look like they could fir a thicker mattress. Seams and hems are solid, and we have not noticed any shrinkage. They are comfy in hot and cold temperatures. We will be watching to buy another set. (Note: we got the natural color, so we cannot comment on the colored sets)",

I received them and they felt hefty in the bag, much more promising than the \u201cbamboo\u201d sheets I ordered previously. I gave them a wash and a light tumble dry before putting on the bed and they are quite soft! Not annoyingly soft like microfiber, but pleasant. I used to enjoy \u201ccooling\u201d sheets because I am a hot sleeper and was a little disappointed that these feel very neutral to the touch. But after one night I realized that these allow air flow so I am not trapped in a hot pocket. It has minimized the amount of tossing and turning I do at night to escape hot spots. I didn\u2019t think buying new sheets would be life changing, but if you\u2019re seeking new sheets I highly recommend giving these a try.",

I wasn\u2019t sure if they would feel scratchy. I woke up and felt amazing. They felt so good all night. I slept through the whole night. They just have this comforting feel about them. Like their grounded. I couldn\u2019t wait to go to sleep again they felt so good. I\u2019m buying them for everyone in my family. I don\u2019t know how they will resist stains but I\u2019m not really concerned. As far as wrinkle free\u2026 they are linen. I don\u2019t think anything linen is wrinkle free. They stretch out nice though and stay put because of them hemming.",

I always wash anything i buy before is wear or use it because you never know what it\u2019s been through. After the first wash it was so soft and amazing. We loved it! We used it in our King bed for a few days, then is started getting loose and every night/morning it would come undone. My worst nightmare. It\u2019s so frustrating. Still soft but now annoying to deal with. Having to get up and keep fixing it and adjusting it back over the mattress.",

Absolutely adore them and will buy more before price goes up. Best price and most highly rated to save anyone time on pulling the trigger. Get them! You won't regret it.",

Bare Home's linen sheets are the best bedding I have ever owned.I have eczema and sleep on the hotter side, so it was really important to me to have sheets that are hypoallergenic, made of natural material, and that didn't trap heat like cotton. These sheets did just that.I am very pleased with the durability, quality, and texture of these sheets. When they arrived, I was cautious since some of the reviews mentioned a rough texture. But having tried other linen sheets in the past, I can attest that the quality and texture of Bare Home's linen is at a premium.They give the best value, being a bit on the pricier side, but an affordable investment for hot sleepers and other sensitive-skin folks.Do yourself a favour and buy them. No regrets!",
