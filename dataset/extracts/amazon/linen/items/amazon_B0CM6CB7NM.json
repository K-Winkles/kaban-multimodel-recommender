                "reviewText": "This is a linen-rayon blend which is pretty much the perfect combination. It looks like linen but doesn't wrinkle like linen. I love the fabric color. It's not rust exactly; it's a little lighter than that but since it's a solid color it blends really well with all sorts of other clothes.The top is advertised as a crop and that's accurate. It hit right at the bottom of the waist; it definitely doesn't go to the hips. If you are going to wear something underneath it, I would suggest something like a tank top or something with a crew neck. I was going to originally wear a golf shirt and realized the collars were competing with each other.The shorts fall to about 2\" below my fingertips, so not too long and not too short. Overall the outfit is a perfect fit for me - exactly as described. It would also be fine to wear the top strictly as a top and not a jacket. It does button on the front but it has plenty of room in it; the buttons don't gape in the front.",

                "reviewText": "This Anrabess two piece outfit really is cute, and it\u2019s both lightweight and comfortable. It mixes/matches well with a variety of common wardrobe items so it\u2019s going to get plenty of use. The top is cute buttoned up or open over a tank top \u2014 nice look either way. Sizing is accurate, matching my typical sizing.The rayon/linen fabric is soft, cool, and comfortable\u2026 very nice to wear. But the care instructions are disappointing \u2014 although the product description specifically states machine washable or hand washable, the product label specifies DRY CLEAN ONLY. That\u2019s a significant discrepancy. I\u2019ll use a dry cleaning sheet for it in my dryer since I don\u2019t want to take a chance on wrecking this pretty set; I\u2019ll update my review with any problems. And although it\u2019s described as a linen set, it\u2019s actually 70% rayon, so that\u2019s a little disappointing too.Overall this is a cute outfit, and although the fabric care and composition isn\u2019t exactly as described I still like it, especially considering the price point.",

And it looks a bit more high end, stylish. It\u2019s the kind of set that can be dressed up too\u2026 like adding some cute jewelry, maybe a cool sun hat.

If I have a summer casual outfit I want to be able to put it in the washing machine.

Next issue, when I opened this package it smelled like perfume, guess I got a returned item. The shorts were also super wrinkled. Hum-bug.",

It fit perfectly, just like on the model. I love that the top and bottom can both be worn separately with other outfits so you get more wearability out of it. I'm in a \"brown\" era right now and the brown was a little bit lighter of a color than I was hoping for. I have blonde hair so really light colors tend to wash me out. I could see me purchasing this again in the future in a darker color like navy or black.",
