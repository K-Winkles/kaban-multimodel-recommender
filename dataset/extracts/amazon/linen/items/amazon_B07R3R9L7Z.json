                "reviewText": "If your body has similar properties to mine, you'll love these pants!Buying clothes without trying them on first is always iffy for me, and finding clothing reviews from ladies who seem to be about my size are rare, so I'm going to clearly paint a picture of my size to help other curvy ladies with a big booty.I am 5'4\" and wear size 24, and my proportions include long waist with shorter legs, a big droopy belly, wide hips, and a big ol' booty. In other words, I can fit in an economy seat on an airplane and need the seatbelt extender for an extra inch about half the time, but keeping that tray table level is a joke.So about these pants:The waist and hips are generous -They fit me perfectly with a little room to spare, which makes them loose and flowy and ideal for hot weather. I can sit comfortably without worrying about popping a side seam. The elastic waist has enough stretch to easily pull them up over my hips.They have pockets!And they're deep enough to hold a large cell phone without worrying that it'll fall out when I bend over.The length -For me it's ideal, maybe a teensy bit long because I step on my pants a little when climbing up stairs. Pants can fit a little short or long, depending on how wide you are, so your fit can vary, but the bottom hem can accommodate letting them out an inch.About the fabric -These are the nicest linen garments I've ever worn. It's lightweight without being see through. I have worn them in a snowstorm in Wisconsin and during a heated in Florida and can honestly say they're comfortably warm in cold weather, cool and breathable in hot weather.Linen does not stink from sweat and subsequent bacteria growth like man-made fibers do. (Think of the underarm stink in a polyester shirt, for example.) Some folks may object to what I'm going to say next, or think I'm a gross slob, but keep in mind humans have worn linen for thousands of years before soap...Despite wearing my 3 pairs of these pants constantly over the past 7 months, they always pass the crotch sniff test.So I haven't washed them.Ever.Again, linen doesn't stink from regular wear.That said, I have no idea about shrinkage, but I plan to (eventually) hand wash them in cold water and hang to dry to reduce any risk of shrinkage.Bottom line, these are incredible pants and my goal is to get at least 1 pair in every color. I'm buying my 4th pair today.10/10 highly recommend.",

I love the look, the flare and the fit, and the color choices, They are easy to slip on, I think they look great, I get a lot of compliments. After washing I put them in the dryer by themselves with a dryer sheet and a damp small towel which also helps to take out the wrinkles!",

                "reviewText": "The fabric after washing held up well. I air dried in dryer and they are less wrinkly than I anticipated. I have only worn these one time for part of a day and were comfortable. The legs are quite wide from mid-upper thigh to ankle. The inseam is a little longer than I typically like in the 5xl but are wearable. I typically wear a 22 or 20 in most pants from JJill or Talbots and I ordered a 5xl and a 4xl. The 4xl fits better than the 5xl. 3xl I would assume to be tight around hip and belly area as the 4xl just fits that area.I am considering buying more. Great price for these linen pants.",

                "reviewText": "I love wearing linen but I've found that many items advertised as 100% linen aren't. I was pleasantly surprised with these, I thought the price was too good to be true!They're a nice mid weight linen, very comfortable. I'd say they're true to size. On me the hem brushes the floor, which is fine, I'm only 5' 2\" so I wasn't planning on them being any shorter. They are baggy but I like it, I'm able to move very freely. Love that they have pockets that are big enough to hold my phone.These are my new favorite house pants, just ordered a second identical pair, and a pair of the brand's cotton pants in the same style.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars White is see through",
                "reviewText": "I bought them in white because another reviewer said the white wasn't see through at all. Mine were very see through, I was wearing light gray underwear that is close to my skin tone and you could see them very clearly through the pants, in lighting that wasn't. I'm not sure if there's been a change in the quality or if the seller is paying for fake reviews.They were also shorter than I expected. I'm 5'5 but have short legs for my height and usually wear petite pants, so I thought these would be around ankle length on me. However, they're a bit shorter on me than on the model. The total length measurement provided wasn't helpful, but the inseam was about 21 inches for both the size 2-4 and size 8-10. I bought both because I was worried size 2-4 would be too small on me, but it fit well. My waist is 26 inches and my hips are 36 inches.I really dislike the drawstring, especially on the size S. The drawstring seems to be the same length for every size, and they didn't make it shorter for the size S. I don't understand why there is a drawstring when the waistband is already elastic.The fabric was ok for the price; not amazing, but it does feel like linen.Overall they are accurate to the picture.",
