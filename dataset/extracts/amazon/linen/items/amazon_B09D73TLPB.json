                "reviewText": "I was pleasantly surprised with the fit of these. They have a slight stretch and a soft feel. I carry most of my weight in my tummy area and I was worried they would pull in an unflattering way. They fit wonderfully across my stomach falling straight down into the wide leg. Unfortunately, I had to return them because the hem hit just above my ankle. I even looked to see if there was enough hem to release but I maybe could have gotten another inch which wouldn't have reached the floor. I am 5'11\" between 170-180 pounds, with a pear shape body. If these had a longer inseam I would've have kept them. If you are 5'9\" or shorter I say go for it.",

                "reviewText": "These pants are very classy. It came with a sash which I didn\u2019t use. The pants look fine without the sash. The pants were nice and cool and light. They are not really see through, but a rule with wearing white pants is to make sure you don\u2019t have on colorful underwear. The material is a cotton/linen mix and flows when you walk. They look expensive! The fit was perfect and I love the pockets on these pants. There is an elastic band in the backside they do stretch at the waist. These are a great pair of pants for the spring and summer.",

In my opinion the ankle length wide length looks silly :( they would have been perfect if they were pre-shrunk",

Usually wide leg, high waisted pants are very flattering on me but these were far from it. I am below average height and they were short on me, as well. With a high waisted wide pant leg, you want them to be a little longer, even if you have to get them hemmed. These did not even reach my ankle..... Overall I would NOT recommend.",
