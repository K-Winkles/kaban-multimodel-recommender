                "reviewText": "I needed something loose around the waist for work due to a recent surgery. I needed something that could work with leggings and also be layered with other things due to my office temperature changing - some days it's chilly, other days it's too warm. It is so difficult buying clothes online, but this looked so cute and I'm so glad I took the risk and tried it! I will be ordering more in the other colors and maybe even another one in the same color because this might just become my new favorite thing to wear every day. To give others an idea on sizing: I have broad shoulders and large chest, I wear a 42DD bra and an average or athletic type of build. I'm 5'5\" and weight around 190 pounds. I ordered the XL and it fits perfectly. I wear it over black leggings and it layers nicely with a cardigan and I also have a bit of room to layer a tank for more warmth underneath if I wanted to. The quality of the material is so nice, sort of a cotton/linen combination. It's not super soft but it's not scratchy at all. I washed in the washer on cold and I meant to hang it out to dry but I forgot and accidentally put it in the dryer on a low cycle and surprisingly it did not shrink! It needs ironing, so that is the only thing I can think of that I don't really love about it, but it's so perfect otherwise that I don't mind! It's worth the ironing because it is perfect in every other way. I love this and am so glad I ordered it. I wish it came in more colors.",

It will shrink just a bit if you put it in the dryer. I love that the back is longer than the front, and the pockets are a unique and useful asset. Comfortable. Sweet!",

                "reviewText": "Really cute style. I ordered up a size from my usual knowing that some styles from China and Japan run small compared to US sizes. No need to do that, it was actually too big. I dried it to shrink it some (label says to hang dry). That worked to downsize it a bit, maybe half a size. It does feel a little rough but i think that looks nice with the natural linen fabric. All the wrinkles from folding in packaging washed out. There is a small flaw in the fabric near one of the seams where the sleeve attaches which is why I only gave 4 stars. It is minimal and I will hand stitch it to keep it from becoming a problem.",

They go with anything, can be put with tights, or just as a dress, dress up or down depending on occasion - I now own one in EVERY color, that's how much I like them! They had a feature marked 'stretch',m but they don't stretch because they are linen. But they are true to size and VERY roomy/airy. The pockets are a HUGE plus.",

It\u2019s still a soft, beautiful milk chocolate color, but definitely lighter.I hate to say it, but I\u2019m genuinely a little bummed on the days I can\u2019t wear one of these.
