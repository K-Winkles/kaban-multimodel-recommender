So I got a purple (burgundy? whatever) pair too, and was very surprised to find the sizing pretty different (smaller for same measurements) and most disappointing, the shape/ fit is really different (flared legs instead of tapered, very tight up top). I decided to keep them but if I'd got these first I never would have bought a second pair and the inconsistency is wild to me, I thought a different pair of the same pants would be like... the same.",

I am already planning on buying more for school.FINAL THOUGHTS: I am impressed with how affordable and high-quality these pants are. They are a great addition to my wardrobe and I recommend them to others.",

                "reviewText": "The athletic fit Amazon chinos are nice. The 28 waist is true to size, the rise is actually more of a mid to high rise. 5'7\" 140lbs, the waist sits about an inch below my navel, but if I have the waist taken in, they could sit a half inch higher. (Fyi, The straight fit Amazon chino sits lower on the waist, where most people wear jeans, mid rise), The 30\" length slightly touches the top of my foot. The crotch and rear are roomy and well shaped, without tenting while standing and without sagging. The calves are slightly too slim for strong legs, pinch test only gives me only 3/4 of an inch of fabric, but I have strong legs for my size. Thick socks might be an issue that might cause the legs to stick to the calves after sitting. The leg opening is good, not as tight as slim fit, ankles aren't showing too much. The olive color is a great dark shade. The fabric quality seems ok, they are slightly thicker than some of the $100 chinos I've tried, but thinner than what you might get from a $150 online made to measure chino. They do get a bit wrinkled through the day, a thicker material would have been better to prevent that... but as a casual \"athletic\" chino the wrinkles don't look too bad. Definitely not going to put these in the dryer, if they shrink they won't fit my calves.These cost a fraction of the price, fit well off the rack, and don't require taking dozens of measurements and several remakes to get them to fit.",
