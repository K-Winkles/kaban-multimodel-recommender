The shirt was nicely folded inside the plastic zip lock bag. I took it out, unfolded it and was pleased to see that it wasn't some tiny scrap of fabric. I tried the shirt on right away and the fit was perfect. The fabric has a nice body to it. Shape wise, the shirt isn't tight but it isn't baggy either. It's the perfect loose fit and actually very flattering. The creases from being folded up ironed out easily. I wore a black tank top underneath and the shirt looked perfect with my black stiped linen pants. I got many compliments on my outfit! I like the shirt so much that I plan to buy another in a different color.",

                "reviewText": "Being an elderly lady with fibromyalgia I wanted a top that fits comfortably, a little loose, looks nice and launders well without ironing. I found all that in these cute cotton/linen tops. I'm very pleased with them. The color pink, however, is not as pictured. It is more a dusty mauve medium color, different but nice. They yellow gold is more a spiced mustard color, also nice but not what I quite expected. I do like it, however. I wash them in warm water and dry them on normal. They come out beautifully without any ironing needed. They do fit slightly loose and the sleeves come just below the elbow, perfect for us elderly ladies. I bought a few of these tops to go with my wide legged cotton trousers....it's a nice look, a little bit of a 60's look...hippy.....goes great with love beads. :) Price isn't bad either. They are a decent material, not too heavy and not see through. Thank you.",

I don\u2019t like see through tops, or bottoms for that matter lol. I also don\u2019t like double layers, so won\u2019t use a tank top, but you can. I love the style and cut. It is a wee bit snug across the bust. Would have liked another inch. I ordered a 2X , I\u2019m a 38 C, but it still is very comfortable, in shoulders, and the sleeves. And the length is perfect. I\u2019m short 5\u20191\u201d. I wear a 2X top and med bottoms. And am overweight.Most tops look like I have a dress on, but this is perfect just a bit past my crouch.Im going to send it back and order the black, navy, and red.
