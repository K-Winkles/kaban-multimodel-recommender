                "reviewText": "I'm ~5'1' and 105 lbs and got these overalls in the Forest Green, size S. I love the color and the fabric is very light and breezy. They definitely make for a fun, artsy look and are comfy and easy to wear. Because of the baggy fit, the hip pockets aren't the most useful. The chest pocket isn't the most useful either because the fabric is relatively thin and lacking structure, so anything you might put in there pulls to the center in a weird way. The butt pockets are probably the most useful of the pockets. I know the fit is meant to be baggy and oversized, but on me, I still feel like they're a bit too oversized. I think it's because the seam running vertically on the outside edge along the hip and leg curves as if it's skimming close to your body, but because the fit is oversized, it doesn't need to curve like that, so it just ends up looking a little too \"pear-shaped\" at the hips for my liking. The legs are also a little long, but look cute rolled up at the bottom, so I just do that. Overall (pun intended), I like them.",

Seems like the crotch and butt area fit ok with the extra large size but very loose and baggy in the stomach/ waist. But this works great for my use right now because I\u2019m wearing these as maternity pants. The straps have many button holes to adjust the length, which is good, because I can still wear these as I get bigger by letting out the straps. Fabric is thin and light and kinda wrinkly. I felt the cold air blow through to my legs when I wore these on a 50 degree dark, rainy, windy day. Fabric felt scratchy on my legs at first, but I didn\u2019t notice it anymore after a while. I try not to do any rough activities wearing these because it feels like they could easily rip. I want to get another pair and cut the legs off to make into shorts for when weather gets hotter.",

En cuanto a la talla, la tabla de medidas ayuda mucho, sin embargo, el tiro del overall es muy bajo y las piernas muy anchas lo que hace que luzca grande.",
