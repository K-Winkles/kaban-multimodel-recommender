                "reviewText": "Love these towels! But, as with most new towels, they are manufactured with a coating that almost repels water and causes a lot of lint. I\u2019ve seen a lot of the reviews complaining of this issue. You MUST do this to rid the towels of the excess lint!\u2026..BEFORE washing them, put them in the dryer and use the no-heat setting. My dryer says \u201cRefresh\u201d. Just a cool temperature. Run the dryer for 30-50 minutes and you\u2019ll see the lint collecting in the trap. Empty trap after each run. I used five cycles until there was barely any lint left in the trap (See picture). And there was a lot! After that, wash the towels with a cup of white vinegar or 1/2 cup of baking soda (dissolved in warm water first) in your washer on hot water setting . **NO detergent or softener!!** Dry on medium heat. The result is lint free, absorbent, soft as clouds, Turkish cotton towels. This should be done with all new 100% cotton towels! I learned this from my mother and it\u2019s fail proof. Please consider this before writing negative reviews. These towels are high quality, incredibly soft and absorbent. I highly recommend!",

It goes great in my bathroom and matches my dark teal shower curtain almost perfectly!These towels have stayed very soft, and are very absorbent as well. Yes, they DO shed for the first couple of washes. Do yourself a favor, and wash them in COLD water with good detergent and NO fabric softener, then dry them on LOW heat without using dryer softener sheets. You may need to do this 2-3 times before you use them. Then, the shedding stops. If you follow these guidelines, they stay really soft and don't shed.Because they are a little heavier quality, they do take a little while to dry when hanging after a shower. I run a tower fan aimed in from the doorway of my bathroom for an hour or so after showering to help them and my bathroom to stay dry (I don't have a window I can open).I will be buying more of these towels!",

Like fancy hotel towels, but not the price of them. Once washed they fluffed up amazingly. They did not bleed much at all, I bought the royal purple and expected a lot of dye bleed. Also I read some issues with lint, I have had minimal lint issues. I did wash these the first time with no softener then dried, then washed again with softener. They are just so fluffy! If you are looking for a light weight towel this isn't for you then. Being they are nice and thick I feel they have a nice weight. Not too heavy though. If I need new towels I will be purchasing more.",

Biggest reason why I'm replacing all my old towels is because I hadn't really followed wash instruction on them, and most had lost their softness and absorption capabilities. Already washed these a few times (properly) and can tell they will hold up. They are still nice and fluffy like they were when I first took them out of the bag.
