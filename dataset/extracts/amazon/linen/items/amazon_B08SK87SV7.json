During hot, humid summer days these felt cooler than shorts.These pants have a drawstring that is sewn into the pant seam, which means it will not come out by accident or by choice. If I could I would remove the drawstring but I understand why it is secured. The waist also has a wide elastic, which I find to be a little too wide. At some point I may open up the seams to remove the drawstring and replace with a slightly thinner elastic.I machine wash on the delicate cycle with cold water, hang dry, and iron on highest setting with steam.",

                "reviewText": "I wear an XXL in this style. I am 5\"4\" and weigh 195 pounds. I am pear-shaped so I carry more weight in my bottom than top.I ordered six althogether: 2 gray, 1 green, and 3 black. I am a high school teacher, and my thermostat is set for the comfort of the students but it's too hot for me because I'm always on the move. I need long pants that are closer to summer or fall weight. I feel lucky that I found these.That being said, the sizing and feel are not consistent across the colors. The gray and green drape beautifully and are consistently comfortable. They feel like a great blend of cotton and linen.The black pants are a heavier, thicker material, and the waistband is larger. It sits below my belly button instead of above. The crotch depth is too low, part way down my thighs. Anything in my pockets pulls the waistband down to the point that it's in danger of dropping beneath my shirt hem. They are physically and psychologically uncomfortable; constantly worrying if my pants will droop makes me very self-consious. NOT a good idea when I'm around teenage boys all day!I returned the black. I don't want them in a smaller size, I like the drape of the other colors better. I returned the black pairs and will buy more gray and green.If it weren't for the problem with the black pants, I would give these 5 stars.",

I followed one persons advice as to removing the too stiff and too tight elastic (yet to do with 2 rows of stitching sewing the elastic onto the waist band, more on that later.) The pants are not as pictured and are far from light weight and linen. In fact, they feel like a loose woven coarse cotton fabric which I had hoped would lose some of that effect after washing in cold water and drying on warm. In fact, they remained coarse. I dried them to shrink them up a bit for fit. They did shrink quite a bit in length which is fine as I wear flat shoes. Since I washed them I naturally will keep them. I am hoping that by removing the elastic they will at least end up with a more casual look and not look like inexpensive scrubs. Too much work for a pair of pants that cost $26. I would not recommend these pants as they are nothing like what is pictured or described",

                "reviewText": "I can\u2019t say enough good things about these pants! I bought them in 4 colors; white, black, green, and tan. They are pictured the same as they came. I\u2019m about 215lbs, 5\u20197 and I bought them all in XL and they fit perfectly. Length is perfect right above the ground, the waste is stretchy enough and you can tighten with the strings, high wasted above the belly button. I bought these in hopes to conceal my belly/lower belly because it\u2019s always been a problem area for me especially in jeans. These are the perfect pant for summer to be light enough, comfortable, and hide those insecurities and still look put together. Love pairing them with a crop top and sandals. They aren\u2019t as flowy and wide as other linen pants I\u2019ve had in the past which I love, they are a bit more fitting all the way down but still have a looser fit and the opening at the feet aren\u2019t swallowing my feet to where you can\u2019t see them. I haven\u2019t washed them yet so not sure if they\u2019ll shrink like the other reviews say. I hope not because I\u2019ll want to live in these all summer! (I tried this years target ones that look exactly the same in an xl and they were just way too wide, baggy, and long for me, get these for a more \u201cfitting\u201d but comfy look)",
