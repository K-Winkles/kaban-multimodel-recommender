Anywho - they are a bit loose in the waist, but nothing a belt or a full meal won\u2019t combat. I also got them in long (I\u2019m 5\u20199\u201d), and they are perfect with a heel.I\u2019m definitely going to order more and if I\u2019m planning on wear flats - I will get the regular length.",

A few comments:1. getting the LONG not only made the length of the pants leg longer, it also made the rise of the pant longer. The fit was so much better in the Long vs. the regular length that it is worth the extra trouble of having to hem them.2. The fabric, not just the color, varies from color to color. The \"black\" is NOT black denim; it is truly a stretchy but very professional and/or dressy looking pair of black slacks. On the other hand, the indigo rinse and the carbon rinse look and feel like denim with a great amount of stretch in the heavyweight fabric. SUPER flattering.I love these pants, in the 3 colors I've bought so far, because they are consistently flattering for my curvy figure, loose but not drapey through the thigh, and have washed really well. I highly recommend these pants!",

The legs are slightly wide and have a slight flare, looking just like the picture. I would just say that if you want a more relaxed fit to size up, especially if you'e between sizes.EDIT: I now own a pair of these pants in khaki (which is slightly darker than pictured) and they run a bit roomier than the black pair. I would not size up in that shade.",

                "reviewText": "I am 100% satisfied with these pants and will be buying another pair ASAP! For reference I am 5'9-ish and 185-ish lbs. (Height & weight are super important in reviews, and the review I read that made me decide to buy included this information.) I got a size 14 long. They fit PERFECTLY. Mid rise waist with snug fit at waist, hips and thighs, then they flow out just a little at the calves, just how I prefer my pants to look. Bootcut I suppose you'd call it. Not skinny, not straight leg, not flair. The material is thicker than I expected, which is a good thing. Deep front pockets. Kinda small back pockets, as most women's pants have. I work in hospitality (restaurant bartender) and black pants are standard uniform for me. Back pockets are just deep enough to hold my bottle opener and wine key. For work I have to crouch down low to stock things, bend in weird ways, and reach up high for stuff on shelves. And these pants dont fall down, slip out of place, or feel too restricting. I usually tuck my work shirt in, and these pants sit at the perfect spot on my waist to do so without feeling uncomfortable. They have belt loops so I can wear a belt with them which I like. Flexible material, but not flimsy. I typically wear a size 10 or 12. But after reading reviews, decided to size up, which was a good call. I can not stress enough how well they fit! If you are on the fence as to whether or not you should buy, just do it! You'll be glad you did!",
