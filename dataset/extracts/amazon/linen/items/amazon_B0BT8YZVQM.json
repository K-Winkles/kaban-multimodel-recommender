                "reviewText": "This little outfit is sooooo cute!!! I bought the black set. The shorts are not too short, the crop top is not too short. It\u2019s very comfortable. The material feels nice. It\u2019s not see through. I am 5\u20199, 160lbs. I have longer legs, thicker thighs and a bigger booty. I am a 34D on top. I am self conscious of my armpit fat, I call them my chicken nuggets. \ud83d\ude43 This square top completely hides my chicken nuggets! I am 44, I don\u2019t usually buy anything with a crop top, when I saw this on an influencer, I liked the look of the crop top without the exposure of the mid section. I bought the large, I can be a medium or a large. When in doubt, online ordering, I usually opt for Large just incase. I also read the reviews about it shrinking. How it looked on her is exactly how it looked on me. I am not sure if the medium would have been too small. The shorts seemed to be higher waisted on some of the pics in the reviews but that could also be body type. It does not make me love this outfit any less. It\u2019s adorable!! It didn\u2019t have any weird smells. Yes, it\u2019s slightly wrinkled but it\u2019s a linen look, that\u2019s what it does. I think any age can wear this outfit. When I tried it on, I sent a pic to my 19 year old daughter and she loved it too and wants to borrow it, we\u2019re the same size and build. I can\u2019t say enough, buy this outfit, you won\u2019t regret it. I am about to buy another color!",

I\u2019m normally a size 2/4 or a small, I bought a medium and it fits really well. The waistband is where it runs small, so the top is slightly larger than I would normally wear but it still looks really nice. The quality is very nice for the price.",

                "reviewText": "For reference I am 5'4\", 155 lbs. I purchased this outfit in light brown. Typically I wear a Medium or an 8/10 in dresses and outfits like these. Returned the original order because the shorts have an invisible zipper on the side and it was broken. I did however find the top and bottom to be a little too small and returned it for a Large so I can hand-wash in cold water and line dry. I would NOT recommend putting this outfit in the dryer as some have asked. For sure, linen shrinks and there is linen in the fabric. The color is more of a terra cotta, but really pretty. Fabric has movement and it looks expensive. Shorts hit at the perfect length and the top hit exactly where I had hoped - without showing any belly. Great little outfit for the price. I liked it so much I also ordered it in Large in Black.",
