They were well packaged with no damage (came rolled in a sturdy plastic case). Material is comfortable and durable. I am short with big hips and thighs. These pants fit comfortably and perfectly for my hard to fit shape. They WILL shrink after a wash, but this actually helped make them the PERFECT length. They look great with a warm weather casual or more dressy outfit. These were my go-to vacation pants.",

They hit just above the ankle and I am taller than the average American woman. However, they are comfy and flattering straight out of the box and seem pretty wrinkle resistant so far (waz suprised they arrived rolled up umbrella fashion). The navy color is as advertised; maybe a little richer in person. The ruched fringe at the top is thankfully not as large as the pictures show. The pockets are large and the material is breathable and pretty sturdy. Good value for the price.",

                "reviewText": "these are the best pants I\u2019ve ever owned for casual.My legs tend to be just a little short I think I\u2019m a size 30 length between 30 and 32 length and sometimes it\u2019ll be just a little long and touch the floor. These come up above the angles, a little bit the light and airy, although I\u2019m wearing them right now and it\u2019s chilly out and I\u2019m not too cold, the bottom of my legs will get cold.Perfect except I know these were made overseas and so I ordered a size big one size bigger and they just fit perfect if they shrink it all and I\u2019m sure they will, then they\u2019re gonna be a little tight on me so I\u2019m gonna order a second size bigger and I\u2019m gonna order a couple more pair. I love them so much.I have never done that before this the first time I\u2019m gonna re-order and get another pair of somethingI will tell you I put on weight and I\u2019ve got a stomach gummy now not huge but it\u2019s poor pooches out you know from my ribs down and that is why they\u2019re a little tight they\u2019re OK. The legs completely fit me perfectly in the legs, but my waist and tummy if they shrink when I wash them they will be a little tight right there in my hips and tummy probably not my hips as much as my tummy but I do not like them tied around my hips or waist.I have multiple sclerosis it\u2019s hard for me to pull pats on our dresses on, etc. etc.So these are for my hands I don\u2019t have to bend my legs like I do with other pants are twisted turn I work my fingers to get buttons done, and I usually do not like tie pants, but these are not bulky around them waste like some areI will say I really like the material.So to recap:If you have a tummy be aware of that when you order the sizeI\u2019m a shorter person and they fit right on my legs they\u2019re not too long.Wonderful material.If you\u2019re handicapped, these are perfect for you to use if you\u2019re mainly in a chair all the time and can\u2019t stand up a lot, I would order an size biggerOrdered one size bigger and they fit perfect if they shrink in the wash, but they probably will need to order a second size bigger be awareYou can\u2019t go wrong.I ordered the color you know the light ecru and they are beautiful",

                "reviewText": "I had purchased two pairs of these pants last summer and I\u2019ve been wearing them regularly. They are a cotton/linen blend, but they rather stiff, not soft like cotton or linen can be, so not sure what that\u2019s about. Given that, they are still rather light feeling and mostly breathable, even on a warm day.I wear an XL in these pants and that\u2019s the size I wear in other brands. I find they run true to size. Just know that this material really (really!) stretches out as the day goes on, so keep that in mind and go with the smaller size if in-between. Also, I find the cropped length flattering on my 5\u2019-5\u201d plus sized frame, which is tough to find in a cropped pant.I just repurchased more colors since the two pants I got only 1 year ago are giving out. One pair had a hole at the crotch seam, while the other pair has a tear near the ties and the white elastic band is showing at the waist band. They are NOT high quality pants, but they fit the other parameters of what I wanted in a late spring/summer/early fall, cropped pant. So I don\u2019t mind replacing them yearly...until I can find something better I suppose! Good enough for now.",

Tr\u00e8s d\u00e9\u00e7ue de la qualit\u00e9 pour le prix. En plus, je ne peux pas le retourner sans frais. La taille \u00e9tait ok par contre, un peu ample comme j'aime et le tissu est assez \u00e9pais et pas trop transparent. Mais si la couture se d\u00e9fait ou d\u00e9chire avant m\u00eame de le porter 1h... c'est pas un bon produit.",
