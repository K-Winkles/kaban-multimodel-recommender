The interior is wide enough, deep enough, but height wise, can be problematic if it\u2019s a tall mug or container . It is also a little louder when in use than other models. It\u2019s microwaves okay , but takes longer to fully heat or cook something.",

When I set the cooking time, even a couple of minutes and press start, it quits and goes to 30 seconds of cooking time. So if I want to cook something 2 minutes after the cooking indicator to 59 seconds down to 30. So if I want toCook something for 2 minutes I have to stand and reset it 40. Microwaving should be easy, not like this.I'm sorry I wasted my money.",

                "reviewText": "It's a good little microwave. But it has a big problem. The settings are extremely user UNfriendly and backwards.Where you normally have the keypad to set the number of seconds/minutes, it's instead a keypad that sets directly the minutes, so let's say you would want to press 45 on a normal microwave for 45 seconds - not this one, you press 4 and it automatically starts for preset 4 minutes.The instructions are pretty much in Engrish and to this day (I've had it for over a month) I was still unable to figure out how to set the clock.",
