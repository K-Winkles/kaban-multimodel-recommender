                "reviewText": "I'm slowly remodeling our kitchen. We purchased a Samsung, four compartment refrigerator, so it was expected to continue with matching appliances. This microwave fit perfectly in decor.Although microwaves have been in kitchens for almost 60 years, and have came a long ways, they still seem to have a few improvements that need improving.I am a retired building contractor, so installing the unit, still comes with its own difficulties. It does take some precautions and planning. Ease of installing, is in perspective of the installer.There is more than adequate lighting in the kitchen, however, I occasionally, slip into the kitchen with low lighting, just to warm up a drink or quick snack, only to find the lit LED clock. The numerical pad is dark and not even touch identifiable, with small less sensitive contact points, which take a more aggressive push to activate. Bright awake is mandatory, as are brighter lights.I went with the 1.9 cuft model for the sensor capability, I have yet to fully custom refine to my particular. And, I assumed the 400 cfm fan, with four speeds, would serve some added advantage. However, being close to the start contact, it can easily be mistakingly activated, on High. The force of the high speed could almost suck the lids off of a pot, then the button has to be repeatedly presses through speed 3...2...1, then off.The operation, power and other standard functions are very acceptable. Maybe a motion sensing lighted keyboard, softer touch contacts, and even a more informative LED operation screen. The Popcorn and Pizza preset buttons are archaic. The 30 sec button is convenient, but should activate without including the start button. It's those little things that ensures me that we have evolved in all this time.So besides most of the primitive features that have only improved in descriptive wording, this unit does function with some efficient capabilities, and of course the primary pride of ownership is its esthetic appearance.Would I buy it again? I hope not, it appears it should last for quite a while.",

I will set it to match other clocks, and a couple of weeks later I am resetting it because it fell behind 2-3 minutes. Also, if you set the cooking timer, you can\u2019t operate the other buttons to microwave anything. Maybe mine is an anomaly because I know Samsung is a decent company. It\u2019s 2 years old at this point, but the one prior was not Samsung and I had it over 10 years!",
