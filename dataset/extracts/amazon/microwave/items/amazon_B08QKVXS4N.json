You still need to know what I experienced with it.It performs the expected features of a microwave, and the air fryer attachment works halfway-decently, but (as I stated in the title) it draws far more power than it should. A microwave of this size is typically fine on a dedicated 15A circuit; the manual for this one insists on a 20A dedicated circuit - and even with that, it still manages to pop my circuit breaker about once every fifty uses (so probably about every month or so on average). Its AC power draw in microwave (i.e. non-convection) mode is allegedly 1350W, which works out to just over 12A, and yet it's popping a 20A breaker?! I probably should have returned it, but the first pop didn't happen until the second month, and I figured it was a fluke.",
