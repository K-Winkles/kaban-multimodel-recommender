It arrived in a timely fashion with no damage or other issues.It is replacing one my folks have used since 1985, which was still working, just not great. Pretty sure this new one won't last anywhere near that long based on reviews, but hoping it will suffice for as long as my parents need it.It fits perfectly in the spot, and, like others have said, it's almost doubled the price of others because GE is apparently the only one who makes one this size which kinda stinks, but if it's what you need, it's what you need need. Also, as someone else mentioned, you cannot install it flush with the cabinets or the door will not open properly\u2026",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Doesn't auto cook very effectively",
                "reviewText": "We purchased this microwave as a replacement for another GE Profile model that finally wore out after 10 yr. Our original model was no longer made & GE said this was its replacement. The appearance is different from the old but that is OK. Old model had a curved frame & glass shape (arched). This is very rectangular & looks more sleek & modern. The old had a nice, small, discreet GE logo decal on the door. This one has a big raised metal round GE logo stuck on the bottom part of the door about the size of a half-dollar coin. I find that unattractive.This model doesn't seem to cook food as good as the other. It takes longer. Both had auto cook buttons & the new doesn't cook food \"done\" when using those special keys. Potatoes are the worst. I have to cook them twice. The older model had easy, 1-step cooking....Push \"potato\" & it cooked a potato completely. If I cooked 1, 2, 3, or 4 potatoes it compensated for that & cooked any quantity correctly. This one takes at least 2 cycles or else the potatoes are hard & not completely done..... Old model, Vegetables - push one button & keep pushing once, twice, thrice, for \"fresh\" \"canned\" or \"frozen\"...this new model, push vegetable button & look at chart in door & then press another number key for 1 - fresh, 2 - canned, or 3 - frozen..... Old model push \"reheat\" & it cooked the food done, hot & ready, no matter a single item, or plate or liquid......This one you push \"reheat\" & then 1 for pizza, 2 for plate, 3 soup, 4 pasta, etc...tedious & you have to look at the chart sticker inside the door b/c you can't remember all the choices. For that reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I was comparing it to the original model we had...This may function like a lot of similar microwaves but my old GE Profile model had easy 1-button commands that cooked the food as it should be cooked.A big complaint we have is there is one very WEAK (dim) light in the interior so you can't see inside the oven while cooking. If something is bubbling over, good luck b/c you will have a hard time seeing it.We purchased this & the other for a specific reason. I wanted a built in microwave oven. Due to double convection wall ovens there was no cabinet space in a standard oven cabinet. I needed a smaller size. This is a counter top model with a trim kit (purchased separately - approx. $18. Not available on Amazon). Original purchase for old model incl trim kit was from Lowe's Home Improvement. The Amazon price for this microwave is the same price as Lowe's & delivers fast. Lowe's was 2-week delivery & had to do store pick up. This came a day earlier than promised, on Easter Sunday no less, but was promised 3-day delivery & it was here in 2 days, front door delivery, yay, Amazon!As mentioned, this is a counter top model with a trim kit available to give the appearance of a built in microwave. It is very attractive in that sense. It will fit in a 12\" overhead cabinet. Instead of just having a cabinet box hole or shelf to set a microwave on, you can put this one in the hole & use the trim kits that is similar to a picture frame & surrounds the oven with a nice frame making it \"built-in\".....If I can take a photo with my phone & come back to this review I will add a picture. I'm typing the review from my laptop.",

                "reviewText": "Replacing my old GE Spacemaker microwave that lasted 15 years. The plug in the back sticks out a little more but this fit just fine into my 28W x 13D space. This microwave sounds a little tin - canny compared to the old one and like other reviewers I\u2019m struggling with reading the buttons but my eyes are 15 years older too! The defrost function is way more powerful so less time is needed and make sure you turn the food or it will not just defrost but cook so keep an eye on things. I received my microwave from this seller in fine condition 2 days sooner than estimated. So far so good.",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Working well but take care if replacing an older built-in model",
                "reviewText": "Our old microwave (RIP) was built into a certain size space, so we had no choice but to buy this model to replace it. I wasn't looking for crazy bells and whistles - just a microwave that consistently does what it is supposed to do. So far so good with this model! If you are looking to replace your older model with this one, read on.Installation: yes, the dimensions are BASICALLY the same - close enough to fit into our existing space. However, the mounting holes are not in the same place (of course), which made for some re-drilling of holes. After a little trial and error :-( we got them in the right place. The larger problem is that the spot where the cord attaches to the microwave is MUCH deeper than the older model. Therefore we could not initially position the microwave flush with our cabinets (as our last micro had been). We had to cut a small hole in the back of the cabinet and drywall in order to accommodate the depth of the cord attachment. But we eventually got it into position securely, in the same space as our last micro, and then we push the button to open the door. Surprise! The door hinge design is not the same as the old micro and while the door does open, it only opens about a quarter of the way, doesn't open the whole way without a push - it rubs against the cabinet on the left. At this point, seeing as we had no other options, we decided to live with it. Surprisingly we are getting used to pushing the door open by hand.Use: works great, just like its supposed to do. It is VERY quiet, which was a nice surprise. Heats foods more quickly and evenly than our old model for sure (again, what its supposed to do IMHO). But it sure gets messy looking rather quickly, as the finish shows every single fingerprint, on the touchpad and the door.Because of the difficult install and the finish that shows EVERYTHING, I'm giving it 3 stars. If I were to rate on the use alone, I'd give it 4 stars.",
