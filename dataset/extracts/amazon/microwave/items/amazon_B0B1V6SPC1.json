                "reviewText": "This review is for the Commercial Chef CHM16100B6C Countertop Microwave Oven,1000 Watts, Small Compact Size.It's big, which I wanted.IT'S LOUD, LOUD, LOUD, which was a surprise.There are no intuitive numbers, for example, with most microwaves if you press the number one, it will start the unit for one minute. This does not do that. However, if you only want 30 seconds, all you have to do is press 30 and start.It seems to do what I need it to do, pop popcorn, reheat food, and cook my vegetables. The spousal unit likes to make microwave eggs, and that seems to work well. Melting cheese is quick, but heating water seems to take a while longer. For two cups it takes four minutes.It has a cord that is almost long enough, almost. Allowances had to be made, but I got it to fit where I needed it to be.PROS: It is a much better unit than the Toshiba ML-EM45PIT(BS) that only lasted for 14 months before it bit the dust, and that was after it had been replaced twice.It holds a large (not x-large) casserole dish, which works for most vegetables.The instructions are easy to understand.It beeps more than once to tell you that your food is ready. That is probably the best thing there is to say about this unit. I don't always hear the first beep.It seems to be heavier & more stable then the Toshiba ML-EM45PIT(BS). That one I could toss around like a rag doll.CONS: It is startlingly loud. You will never be able to make that popcorn without everyone knowing about it.I really wish the cord was just a few inches longer.There are no intuitive numbers.",

It was a more expensive microwave and stopped working just 6 months after we purchased it\u2014totally quit in the middle of microwaving something! We submitted a claim because it was still under warranty and are STILL waiting 4 months later for a replacement\u2026.way too long to receive a new appliance! And, their warranty representatives are horrible\u2014they could never tell us when we would receive the replacement microwave (we are still unsure if and when one is coming). Now, we\u2019re out the money for this microwave (that we STILL haven\u2019t received) and a new microwave we ended up purchasing because we need one for daily use. Save your money and purchase from a different company!!",
