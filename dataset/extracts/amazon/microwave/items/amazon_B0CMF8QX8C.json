Sometimes I can finish a full bag but sometimes I just want a smaller snack. 2. I can now pop my popcorn with however much butter, oil, spices, or treats I want. 3. I feel as though I am making efforts to save the environment from the paper bag popcorn.It is also a great travel companion as the bowl is collapsible when not in use.The only problem I face is how hot the bowl is when taking it out of the microwave but I also felt that when taking popcorn bags out of the microwave as well.It's easy to clean and easy to use. Perfect for my regular popcorn fix.",

                "reviewText": "This popper works wonderfully! You can make a whole bowl in less than 3 mins! There are two measurements marked in the bowl and I tend to stick to the smaller of the two which pops as much as you would get in a regular sized bag of microwave popcorn. However this is more like air popped popcorn. You can add butter to the bowl before you pop the corn. But to me it doesn't really change the flavor much. You can always melt butter and pour it over too. I also love that the bowl colapses and takes up less space.",
