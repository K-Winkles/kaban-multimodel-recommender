Less waste and cheaper per batch! We use avocado oil and have had no issues with burning. We found about 3:30-4:00 minutes to be our magic number for a full batch. I think the only thing I wish is that it was a little bigger and could hold a bit more popcorn but that's partially because it makes such good popcorn that we often end up making two batches back to back.",

                "reviewText": "How I wish my father was alive because he always looked for a great way to pop kernels most healthily. And this Amish popper, while not exactly working the way I thought it would after reading the directions- produced the freshest, healthiest, and amazingly good popcorn I have ever had. It tasted fresh, light, and with the slightest perfect crisp. My husband said it tasted \"so fresh\" when I had him try some (however he wants butter on his popcorn but doesn't have any issues yet, to make him worry about eating healthy). But, you can add butter to the popping if you want- as they said a small amount of oil can be added in the directions.If you look at the photos that I took, I chose to pop the Rainbow Unique Blend. And, I finally answered the question I had since childhood- will rainbow seeds produce rainbow popcorn? Just kidding- I knew they wouldn't, however it doesn't mean I didn't hope that by some strange Amish process, they did.Following the directions, after I unfolded the popper, I filled to the first line- which I knew wouldn't produce much popcorn. But as I was trying this out for the first time and no one else wanted popcorn- I didn't want to make much. As you can see in my photos, filling it took more than half the bag of kernels I was given. But, normally manufacturers never give out food to go with products you buy so this order was a real boon- getting everything all in one box- the popcorn and the popper.When placing the lid I noticed it didn't fit on the top properly. On the directions, they said it was okay and that during popping it would raise to the proper height. While it didn't rise to the top the popcorn turned out great so it didn't bother me. I deduced the top is more or less a cover to ensure the corn doesn't go flying everywhere when popping.I eat the popcorn as I write this and it's addictive. I never thought I would find a healthy way to pop good popcorn but I have. And now I am going to have to find out how to get more Amish popcorn when I am finished with what is included in the kit. I am excited to try different kinds- rather than different toppings- to make things I eat as healthy as possible as I get older and my blood pressure and health get worse. While it says you can add oil (and probably butter too)- I would stick to the healthy way to eat popcorn- even with children, as it is best to set healthy habits early.Just like my dad tried to do when I was young- using little brown lunch bags to pop popcorn for me. One night I thought to pop some for him and put my own version of a top on the bag- which was a twist tie. The funny thing is that I didn\u2019t think about the metal inside the tie- and a fire inside the microwave ensued. Had I had the choice of a popper like this- and popcorn- Amish would have been the way I went my entire life.",

                "reviewText": "** If you look at my pictures first, please keep in mind that it was my first try! Read my review BEFORE judging this product on the pictures! **Okay, so this is my 3rd microwave popcorn popper. The first one I ever had was one that I purchased from someone as a fundraiser for their school. It was way back when silicone was just starting to be used to make bakeware and other cooking products. My second one was a purchase to supplement the first one for when I would host movie nights and needed to pop multiple bowls of popcorn. (I lost both of those in a separation. It's like a divorce, but without the \"I do!\") I missed my healthy snack and was happy when I saw this popper.My first time using it I got distracted and wasn't listening close enough. That's why the popcorn got burned. I had set the time to 2.5 minutes like my previous poppers, and it was too much. After I gently shook the burnt center to the top and removed it, the rest of the popcorn was really good. One of the things that I was surprised at with this popper was the ability to use oil. My previous ones didn't allow that. I haven't tried it yet, but am going to soon! I am going to have to try the suggestion of using vinegar to help get rid of the burn marks.The reason why I said that I had some mixed feelings about this popper is because of:The Bad / Iffys:1. It doesn't compress down to such a point as most microwave popcorn poppers that I have seen. Which means that it will take up a lot more room to store.2. The whole thing seems more bendable than anything else I have ever owned that is silicone cookware. This makes it hard to wash and clean. Just trying to hold onto it and wash it with your dish rag is more difficult.The Good:1. This can use oil if you prefer your popcorn made that way.2. Has fill lines to make it easy to measure how many kernels to add for popping. Many others require you to measure out your kernels with a measuring cup.3. Seems to do a fantastic job at popping the corn! I only had 3 un-popped kernels. WOW!!!They even include 2 bags of kernels to get you started, and a nice instruction and troubleshooting sheet in the box.\ud83e\udd78 ** Dr. Geek Says: Microwave and Air-popped popcorn, made with no oils and no butter, salt, or other shake-on popcorn seasonings is the healthiest snack that you could possibly eat. It will also help make you feel fuller, quicker than any other snack. Here's an additional hint, sprinkle on a healthy amount of ground black pepper. Not only will the black pepper add some great flavor to your healthy snack, but it will also add some great health benefits. Black pepper has been proven to aid in digestion, and in helping your body absorb good nutrients and fats while blocking the bad. There are a bunch more other reasons as well. Look it up!* This was an Amazon Vine order. Products may be received at little to no cost in exchange for my sincere/frank review after trying and testing.

                "reviewText": "Flexible so it compresses for storage but rigid enough to stand up fine when used as serving bowl. Rubber side handles stay cool and make it easy to move and use as bowl to eat out of in addition to pop in. Washes easily in dishwasher even with oil or butter residue. Distributes heat well and results in very few unpopped kernels which are easily shaken to the bottom. Great product - more convenient and will replace my glass jar popper.",
