I will be more careful when ordering next time. I could have taken it back to Kohls to return but that option is no longer available. again disappointed with Amazon about that as well.

It's cheap plastic the hinges do not connect together it does not close it has little grips on either side of the handle to grip the lower handle but they don't grip and so it doesn't close and so you end up with a space of at least a quarter of an inch to half an inch wide around the device itself and of course when you put your egg in it to cook it in the microwave sometimes the yolks explode and so you still end up with egg all over the microwave you'd be better off just to put it in a bowl and put a saucer over the top of the bowl to hold the little splatter in I will not buy this brand again I should have spent the extra money and bought a better quality product but being disabled and on a fixed income I was trying to be cheap. But you get what you pay for buy cheap you get cheap products but this one is not worth the time or the money to get.",
