        "description": "The \"Chibikuro-chan 2 Cup Cooker with Binchotan Charcoal\" is a rice cooker for cooking small amounts of rice quickly and deliciously. You can also use the hot cake mix and milk to steamed bread. Cook from 0.5 servings to 2 servings. Measuring cup with a non-stick scoop. How to use How to cook white rice (1) Measure your desired amount of rice with the included measuring cup. 2 pairs of scraping cups (1 serving). (2) Place rice in the container and then peel it off. (Use the inner lid to drain. (3) Fill with rice and add water according to the amount of rice. (It can be kept for 15-30 minutes depending on temperature difference in summer and winter). Water volume: 2 gross / approx. 14.2 fl oz (420 cc), 1 gross / approx. 7.2 fl oz (220 cc), 0.5 gross / approx. 4.2 fl oz (120 cc). (4) Lay rice flat and place the lid on the middle and cover the top lid with the upper lid (middle lid facing up). Heating time: 2 gross / approx. 13 minutes, 1 gross / 9 - 10 minutes, 0.5 - 7 - 8 minutes (5) After heating, steam for 10 minutes to 15 minutes. Then stir in a way that loosens the entire body. The amount of water, heating time and steam time are only a guide. Adjust to your preference. Since the microwave heats up rapidly, if you do not have enough water for rice, it will lead to rice. If you need it in a hurry, please handle the warm water to adjust it. Please note that white rice may be slightly spilled on some items. The listed heating time is a standard 500 W microwave oven. When using 400 - 600 W, please heat it up by 10 - 20 %. The heating time may vary slightly depending on the microwave manufacturer and model, so it is necessary to add heating time little by bit. Care Instructions: Before using, please fill the container with water for about 8 minutes, set the lid and other items and boil before using. It will release plastic smell. Please wash the stains after use with a mild dish soap and a soft sponge. (The scrubbers, pollen, and sponges with abrasive material may cause scratching.) Precautions for Use: Since it is for microwave use, please do not use on direct flames, orbovetops, or toasters. Avoid cooking in the microwave or cooking food with low moisture. When heating, make sure to set the rice cooker in the center of the microwave. When using in microwave ovens, grill and toaster function (composite) microwave safe. If the composite electronic electromagnetic has a key for \"rice cooking\", do not use the key, and be sure to use the \"stove\" key. Please avoid cooking with oily foods as the temperature may become very high. After cooking, transfer to another container. If you want to store it, please transfer it to a storage container. Do not store this product. Do not place near fire. When removing from the microwave, be sure to hold the outer container with both hands. It may break if dropped or exposed to sudden impact.",

                "reviewText": "The idea of using a microwave to cook rice was not something I thought was a really viable alternative to a rice cooker. And my first attempt did produce a rather hard mass of rice fused together. As in other reviews there was no instruction in English, so trial and error was the only solution. What worked for me after the second attempt was to put one measured cup of rice in the container and put about three cups of water in and stirred it around with the included rice paddle for a few minutes and drained it using the inner lid. This gets rid of a lot of the starch. (I had not done this the first time along with not enough water which accounts for the hockey puck I had produced) Then I added two measured cups of water, added a little bit of pulverized garlic and salt (not garlic powder) and set it to cook for 11 minutes. At the 5.5 minute mark I stopped the microwave and stirred (really just to check on it to see if there was enough water) and set it to cook for another 5.5 minutes. I took it out of the microwave and set it on the counter for two minutes and opened it up to find two perfectly cooked cups of fluffy rice. I used long grain Basmatti rice and look forward to trying different types now that I know it works, and works well.",

                "reviewText": "Since this did not come with English instructions, I followed a reviewer's advice on how long to set the microwave for 2 cups of rice. Big mistake, do no follow any of their tips no matter how well intended. I set it for 13min (7.5 per cup they advised) but water boiled out of the lid so badly and made a mess of my microwave. I even thought the lid had melted but thank goodness it didn't. So I scanned the included Japanese directions on google translate and it says to microwave 2 cups rice at 9minutes in a 700w microwave. I went to a friend's to use their smaller microwave which was 700w but at 8minutes again a lot of water boiled out of the lid (see pic). And again the rice was hard, even after letting it cool off for 30min in the pot after cooking as some reviewers advised.This thing is a piece of junk, Amazon's worst product and should be removed from their site as it's simply dangerous. Wished I took a photo of how awful it looked boiled over yesterday. This photo does not show how badly the water can boil over if left heating for over 8minutes and I'm not gonna attempt a 3rd try and having to clean up my microwave again from an explosion of hot water. So disappointed as I've been looking forever for a mini 2 cup rice cooker for our son to use in his college dorm because they have very small microwaves.",

                "reviewText": "This steamer works okay, but you already need to know how to microwave rice unless you can read Japanese. Luckily I microwave rice often. And what instructions I could read shows the instructions are for small low power microwaves (500 - 700W). Mine is 1100W. Luckily for me, this steamer will only be used once or twice a year.",

                "reviewText": "Since the product manual is in Japanese, this is how I use it. I often cook rice this way unless I need to cook SUSHI rice where a more expensive rice cooker excels in taste. I measure one cup in a SANDWICH bag, wash the rice in the bag, drain, add a cup and a half of water (add more water if you like), close the bag and leave the BAG t in the cooker for a few hours or overnight. I microwave it for 12-15 minutes while preparing a meal..Using Ziploc bags prevents water from spilling out of the cooker..",
