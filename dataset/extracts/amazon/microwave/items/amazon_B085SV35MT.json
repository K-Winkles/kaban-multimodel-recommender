This is a countertop combination oven that can also become a built-in by installing an optional trim kit (NN-TK81KCS, sold separately). What is the purpose of Silent Mode? Fantastic for families with little kids, or anyone who would prefer not to hear a beep when the oven\u2019s timer is done. To activate, press Start 3 times until you see BEEP ON then press Timer/Clock once to change to BEEP OFF. Press Stop/Reset to exit. How much space must be left around the oven in order to ensure proper air flow? Allow 6 inches (15 cm) of space on the top of the oven, 4 inches (10 cm) at back and 2 inches (5 cm) on both sides. If one side of the oven is placed flush to a wall, the other side or top must not be blocked. Do not remove feet. Can this product make toast? This product is not intended to be a toaster replacement. The Broil function can toast bread, but only on one side. It is best used to create perfectly browned meals and snacks, from pizzas, appetizers and flatbreads to casseroles and desserts. Why does the microwave fan continue to run after the cooking cycle is complete? The oven has a built-in cooling cycle that helps to protect the interior components and insure long-term durability. Depending on cook time and mode, you may hear the fan up to 6 minutes after cooking is complete to fully cool the oven's interior.",

                "reviewText": "My main reason for purchasing this was because of the air fryer option. Not too long ago I purchased the Instant Pot Vortex Air Frier, it was my first air fryer and I was so excited to use it only to be disappointed. It was expensive, yet very cheaply made and required constant cleaning! Since my current microwave was old I though this would be the perfect replacement and would allow me to also get rid of the space my Vortex was taking up on my countertop! I absolutely LOVE this microwave!!! I am still learning all the different features but after a couple weeks of trying different functions out here are my thoughts:First off, it is very pleasing to the eye! It has a nice sleek look and the inside is nice looking too. It shipped in a huge box and I thought \u201coh no this is too big for my space\u201d but after unpackaging it I found it fit perfectly. Although I purchased this for the air fryer option, I have to say my favorite feature is the automatic reheat food function. You don\u2019t have to set a time, just pop your food in and press the start button and it reheats your food to perfection!!! No having to constantly take your food out and mix it and put it back in over and over and have some parts over cooked!For testing out the cooking functions I used recipes from the Drop App (which is very handy by the way!) I started out with the easiest one I could find, the Udon Noodle Bowl that uses the microwave function. Everything in the dish was fresh (except the pre-cook Udon noodles) and in 5 mins it was done! Next I wanted to use the air fryer option, so I made the Teriyaki Glazed Salmon. It was really easy to make and turned out great. However, the salmon was a little funny looking when I turned it over due to it laying on top of the broccoli. I also used the Combo 2 feature to make baked potatoes to go with the salmon and they turned out just like they were cooked in the oven! I was also amazed at the fact the microwave was still clean after cooking/air frying and required nothing more than a little wipe with a cloth. My Vortex would have required a complete clean down!Now that I was feeling more comfortable with the unit, I decided to try something a little more challenging. I made the Plant Based Meat Lasagna, but I used regular ground beef since I am not a fan of plant based. This recipe uses the Combo 1, Microwave, and Convection bake functions. It sounds like a lot, but It was surprising easy. It would have turned out perfect if I had not of accidentally put my mozzarella cheese on before I was supposed to, but aside from my over cooked cheese on top it was delicious! I also air fried some chicken tenderloins and brussel sprouts.All in all, I am very impressed. It goes beautifully with all my other stainless steel appliances and so far has been fairly easy to use. Some of the cons I have is that after every use the fan still runs for a little (I am assuming to cool it back down) which can be a little noisy and like all other stainless steel appliances you have to constantly remove finger prints from it. The air fryer basket is very large and holds a lot, but it is not the easiest to clean. I also find it a little difficult to use the air fryer for things outside the recipes in the drop app, the owner\u2019s manual gives time guides for a handful of items like frozen foods and meats but not for vegetables. Googling air fryer times the temperature are different and this doesn\u2019t allow you to choose air fryer temperature so I did have to play around with the timing a bit. I have provide some images of the unit and things that I have cooked. I would definitely recommend this and it would be a great unit for a college student who lives in a dorm!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent machine but with a few design issues",
                "reviewText": "I had been using a Sharp Carousel microwave (with a power rating of 1100 W) for over 20 years. The Panasonic differs in 3 respect: it uses the newer \u201cinversion\u201d technology, the microwave is rated at only 1000 W, and it has a grilling element on top. It\u2019s taken me a while to adapt (and I\u2019m still modifying my old recipes) but I\u2019ve reached some conclusions. First, the inversion technology really does heat the food more evenly, and makes the device much more useful. I was often reluctant to defrost food with my older machine because the surface 1-2 inches would get too warm while deeper food remained icy. And for the same reason, I rarely cooked any food in it (even homogeneous items like a hamburger). With inversion technology the food heats more evenly and I\u2019ve started to use it for simple meals. At only 1000 W, it takes a little longer to cook food than I would like, but I assume that they reduced the power of the microwave to divert power to to grilling elements. It used to take me 1 min 20 sec to heat water for instant coffee - now it takes 1 min 40 sec; and I could make one potato in 7 minutes while now it takes 7 min 30 sec. This is not a big deal, but I would have preferred a 1100 - 1200 W microwave. Finally, the grilling element is a really nice feature. Previously (in my old microwave), frozen fish fillets came out watery. If made in my toaster oven it took 22 minutes (as specified on the fish carton). With the Panasonic, using combined grilling and microwaving, the fillets cook in 4-1/2 minutes and come out fully cooked and crisp!I\u2019ve noticed many complaints about the machine\u2019s power - especially with the grill. It\u2019s not really discussed in the user manual (but a it was discussed in the manual fro another Panasonic device and it appears to apply to this model as well) - when one selects \u201ccombined microwave + grill\u201d the microwave power is reduced to 40% and only one of the 2 grilling elements glow. I assume that this was done to prevent too much power from being used, and possibly to slow the cooking rate down - but it does reduce the power. I have found that for some foods it\u2019s better to use the microwave and grill sequentially rather than simultaneously (For example, I cook frozen french fries using the microwave at power 8 and then brown them with the grill on high power). But for some foods it\u2019s simpler just to use the combination. It takes a bit of experimentation to figure out the best settings for each meal - but having the grill available really does help. It\u2019s simpler than using 2 appliances and foods come out evenly cooked and crispy.On the down-side, the keyboard is poorly thought out. I am used to a numeric keyboard. If I want to cook a thing Power 3 I would press \u201cPower\u201d and the number \u201c3\u201d. With this machine you have to press the Power button repeatedly as it counts down from 10 to 3 with each push. And there are 3 buttons to set the time - one for units of 10 min, one for units of 1 min, and one for units of 10 seconds. (You can\u2019t heat something for 8 seconds or 15 seconds - you can only enter time in 10 second intervals!) Again, it would be so much simpler to press \u201cTime\u201d and then 1-4-0 (for 1 min 40 sec) than to press the 1 min button once and the 10 second button 4 times. I have a few other minor issues with the keyboard, but they are less important. Also as noted, the interior light is too small.All in all, I think this microwave has proven to be more useful than my older machine and I am very happy with the purchase. But due to the reduced microwave power and it\u2019s complicated keyboard system, it gets only 4 out of 5 stars.",
