                "reviewText": "Got a Galanz blue mini fridge about 3 1/2 years ago when looking for a new full size fridge. They had a display of them on sale in the store so bought it basically on a whim cause we liked the design and color (had already started with the teal blue accent theme in the kitchen) just to have as an emergency back up/overflow/beer/soda fridge. It's worked great ever since. So when the microwave that we've had for over 20 years started acting up for months and seemed to be getting worse we decided to get a microwave to match the fridge. We had also got the Galanz toaster oven which has been working great, so now we have a nice matching set of small appliances. The microwave works great, is easy to operate and has more options than I need! It still fits a dinner size plate but is a little smaller than our old microwave and heats just as well as the old one. I'm a fan of the color and the retro look so we are very happy Galanz customers. Don't have the long term use to review with this yet (4 months) but so far all of our Galanz products have worked perfectly. Happy to recommend.",

                "reviewText": "We purchased the (Galantz,9 cu ft/modern, green color), from Amazon. The microwave was nicely packaged. (Didn't have any scratches, dents etc). We were soooo happy about that. It's a pretty microwave, with the WOW factor!!! It gives the kitchen a nice classy/retro flair. Believe me.... your friends/family will notice this microwave!!! We like that it has the time, rotary timer, and handle to open the door. The only thing with the microwave, is that the (ring), under the glass plate tends moves around. It's not a big issue. We just adjust it, as we use it. The other thing, is that you will need a silicone pad under this microwave, b/c it will shift/move as you open/close the door. We like all the programs it has for reheating/cooking etc. However, we only use microwaves to heat/reheat. We (never have, or never will) use a microwave to cook food. The max. time we use to heat/reheat is 2:30 minutes. We purchased this Galantz microwave over a month ago, and we absolutely love it!! Heads up.....the green color is more of a turquoise green. It's a very elegant color!!! We absolutely love it!!! No Regrets!! \u2764\ufe0f",

                "reviewText": "I recently moved into a new apartment and it was built in the 40s. The apartment is reasonably small but my kitchen is tiny and the outlet situation is a bit of a challenge. I bought a Toshiba microwave and realized quickt that it was muuuuch too big for the space. I returned it and decided to buy this retro aesthetic microwave instead. I was hesitant as it is only 700 watts and after reading reviews I wasn't sure if I was just paying for a pretty look rather than something that works well. Although, I haven't had it that long, she works wonderfully. I have to warn you that I do not do hardcore cooking with my microwave. I do use it to defrost, rather I use it for the lightweight reheats, microwave meals, and soups. I was worried that perhaps I would have to run it for several minutes more but that hasn't been the case. Sometimes I pop it in for an extra 30 seconds and it is fine. I have noticed slightly that there seems to be hot spots but for the most part, if the food is something I can stir then it makes the rest of the food hot and it hasn't been a problem. If you are short on space then this may just be a saving grace. It is wonderfully small although my fiestware 10 inch plate does fit snugly. It is beautiful and easy to use.",

I was apprehensive about how difficult it might be to use after getting used to touch screens, but it's a breeze. I actually prefer the controls, let alone the look, over my old one. Extremely happy with this purchase. It's also very quiet, and the compact size fits perfectly in my little kitchen.",

I didn't know how this would work out, but it is a perfect fit in the space I have for it, matches the kitchen cabinetry hardware & compliments the old swirled green countertop in my 71 year old house. It also heats well and evenly and is easy to use. On the downside it is rickety & loud, the interior light is dim and feels cheaply made which is noticeable when you open and close the door or turn & push the knob to cook. If it lasts for a year, I will be amazed. I guess uncertain quality is the price you pay for decor and style. I love it and will be keeping it and hoping for the best over time.",
