                "reviewText": "For everyday, \"grid up\" microwaving, we have a larger / full size in the kitchen. I got this unit because if the grid was down, having a way to microwave food, heat up water, etc. in a microwave that doesn't draw nearly as much wattage is ideal. I have several smaller solar generators, but my sole \"big one\" is 3,600 watt hours & can handle a surge over 2,000 watts.At 700 watts, this microwave is well below that surge, and if using for 5-10 minutes, wouldn't take too much of a dent out of battery reserves. Heats pretty good, as long as you don't have super high expectations for how much food / how big of a container it's in, etc. Yes, there are other ways I could heat food & water in an emergency...but nothing as fast or convenient as throwing it in the microwave. And yes, even my larger microwave could run off of my big solar generator, but the full size takes 1,350 watts...nearly double this one. And, it doesn't take twice as long to get food or a cup of water hot (not boiling, but just hot enough to add hot chocolate or a powdered supplement / vitamin, etc.), so it's a net-positive to go with this microwave.I'd say if you have a smaller space, RV, or if you're also looking for a heating alternative to use in a bad situation, I'd recommend this!",

I moved into a place without one, and I just needed something to reheat coffee and the occasional leftovers. This little guy does the trick! It's heavier than expected for its size, but I'm not going to be carrying it around, so that's ok.The control panel takes some getting used to - it only has pre-set times and you don't have the ability to punch in your own time like you would on a bigger (ie more functions) unit. So you have to stand there and watch it to stop it if you need something less than 30-second or full-minute increments. Again, not a huge deal as I'm warming coffee or leftovers - either way I'm not leaving them in the microwave for very long.",

It is a 700 watt, compact microwave oven with basic functions - no extra bells and whistles generally found on full size, more expensive units.This would be great for college dorm rooms, an RV trailer, or small studio apartments - any place where space is at a premium.For me, this works perfectly as I have limited countertop space and I'm not an avid microwave user. I only periodically use a microwave to reheat leftovers and make the occasional mug cake.

                "reviewText": "This microwave is as described. This is a small microwave that would be good for a small apartment or anywhere that space is at a premium. A standard sized dinner plate will fit into the microwave. This controls are basic and easy to understand. This 'style' of user interface requires you to press a 'time' button before entering in the cook time, otherwise the numbered buttons immediately start the microwave when pressed, I think the time set is the number of minutes equal to the number pressed. This is a lower wattage microwave. The unit looks nice and the metal exterior seems to be well constructed. We plan to use the microwave as a second unit to heat up items in the kitchen.",
