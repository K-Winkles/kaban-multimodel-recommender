I did some research and learned that Cosmo makes a variety of high end kitchen ranges, range hoods and microwaves that are sold through Home Depot and other such places. Now that I've installed this microwave my wife and I could not be happier. It's sleek, modern appearance compliments our other black appliances, the unit works perfectly, it's quieter than our Kenmore was, the controls are easy to read and intuitive and my wife really likes the way the dual lighting illuminates the stove top while she's cooking. For us, this is a 100 percenter.....love it!",

It is a good thing the end of time beep is loud enough because we forget the microwave is on. Easy door opening and smooth door closing is very important to us and Cosmo does a great job with both! We've had it almost a month and I love it! It is so quiet, looks great, the buttons respond quickly, overall excellent microwave! So thrilled we found it!",

                "reviewText": "Our former over-the -range, vented microwave lasted 25 years. It finally just stopped turning on at all. After an exhaustive search of every brand with the same features and size, we settled on this COSMO model.I can't list all of the additional touch features it has, but it's significantly more. The lights are LED, very bright, and come with a dimmer switch. It's also a quieter operation and a quieter exhaust fan.Installation was easy enough, though it is tricky to get all the holes to line up in the right place even with the paper template that is provided. If you are not someone that is mechanically inclined, I highly recommend you seek professional installation.We like this so much, we are seriously contemplating buying a matching range from COSMO.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this to replace the broken microwave in my RV. 24\" over the range microwaves are harder to find than I thought. I could not find a microwave that was as deep as the old model. All 24\" microwaves are 24\" wide, but my older microwave was much deeper, and the cabinet space it was designed to fit in was also deeper. So the new microwave was set-back 4\" too deep in existing cabinet space which is a problem because it requires a rear wall mount and the range vent is top vented and the door did not have enough room to hinge open. The fix was rather simple, I screwed two 4x4s vertically to the wall into the stud location and anchored the mounting plate to that. Its behind the microwave and you cant see it. Otherwise its a great microwave for the price. About 20 pounds lighter than the old unit, much more sleeker looking, and I dig the way the door opens. All and all, very happy with the purchase. Its a good microwave for the price, and matches the stove well. Brings a little modern touch to the 13 year old RV.To know if you'll have issues or not having to shim the microwave out from the wall, measure the depth of your cabinet, if its around 15\" or so (normal) you should be good. If its deeper than that, then whatever that distance is, is the size of the shim. My cabinet stuck out 19\". I needed a 4\" shim.Good luck, its a nice, sleek, unit.I'm giving it a 5 star on install, its not the manufacture's fault my cabinet was so deep.",

                "reviewText": "The microwave looks sleek and the dimensions were spot on to fit perfectly over our range. Only problem... the microwave arrived with dents on every corner. One corner was dented so badly it pushed the side out over an inch and a half. I was going to over look the dents and try to install it. I thought maybe the dents will be covered by the cabinets. I started to install the brackets to the wall, but something told me to test it out first. I placed a cup of water inside and set the cook time to 45 seconds. The light turned on and the fan started to blow. The glass plate started it's rotation and I was so relieved... until I pulled out the cup. No change in water temperature. I unplugged, waited 30 seconds and tried again. This time trying to warm up a cold cup of tea. Again... you guessed it, no temperature change.I was so disappointed. I really wanted this microwave to work. It looked so good with my Samsung stove and black stainless fridge. Welp I guess I'll stick with the brand I trust... Samsung.",
