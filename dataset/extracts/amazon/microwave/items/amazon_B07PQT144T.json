                "reviewText": "I LOVE this microwave. Reheating food is a balance between how much energy is introduced at the outside of the food and how quickly it convects through the food to warm it up. The inverter allows me to achieve that balance.I never have problems with my food sizzling and popping yet still coming out cold. I've found that the power setting of 4 works best for reheating food. The downside is that it takes twice as long to do it this way. But honestly, am I really in such a hurry that I can wait two minutes but not four?High power is great for heating water or thin soups, but not so much for reheating that leftover Thanksgiving turkey. The outside will get hot enough for the fats and oils at the surface to heat beyond the boiling point, which then causes the water droplets to immediately vaporize causing the sputtering and popping. Reducing the power level with an inverter microwave heats the outside more gently and allows conduction within the food to carry that heat to the inside before the outside heats up past the boiling point, warming it more evenly.If you're the kind of person that just wants to put your food in and press a button to blast it with high power and \"heat it as fast as possible\", you won't get much out of the inverter technology... and you'll continue to eat leftovers with the outside overheated and the inside still cold.As others have noticed, you also have to be very precise about where you press the buttons. They won't register if you don't press them exactly in the middle of the pad.Also, the microwave beep is very loud. I just shut off the beep (instructions to do so are in the manual).",

                "reviewText": "Bought this Panasonic Microwave because it was most similar to the model we bought seven years ago which was highly satisfactory. Fortunately everything except the user interface seems similar and works well with smooth cooking and power to spare in a compact package (with identical L x W x H footprint) Unfortunately the user interface is less friendly than the original and everything requires more button pushes. Two gripes appear to be child safety related. If microwave needs restarting after only a short period, the RESET button must be pushed first to clear and re-enter data. Child safety features like this should be able to be programmed OFF by adults and seniors without children. Programming buttons also require much more pressure to respond so expect lots more entry errors. The KEEP WARM function was eliminated. Now to get to the KEEP WARM power level, the POWER LEVEL button must be pushed 11 times to get to the Level 0 Power. The Add Time function essentially does nothing except use up the button that used to be for KEEP WARM. Our unit and that of some other reviewers generated a peculiar chemical smell when the oven was cooking which fortunately on our unit gradually decreased every day until it became hardly noticeable after a week or so. If your unit doesn't follow this trend or gets worse with time, return it immediately for replacement.",

My handy husband was able to fill in gaps on side to make it look great. Works great. Little smaller than I wanted, but fits the bill.",

                "reviewText": "We were looking to replace a 14 year old Kenmore microwave and were frustrated that so many of the newer models were too big, a step backward in power, or got terrible reviews. After hours of reading Amazon reviews, I finally settled on this one and have not been disappointed. It fits in the space, it looks nice, and it does what a microwave is supposed to do :-). In fact, it takes about 25% less time than our old microwave with the same wattage, which may be a product of the inverter technology. My only complaint is that the buttons are a bit hard to push, which sometimes pushes the microwave itself backwards on the countertop. But that's relatively trivial on our list of things that were important to us in buying a microwave. HOWEVER, we have discovered that running the microwave interferes with our Roku (in another room). Again, for us, this is relatively trivial because (a) we don't have a lot of \"smart\" devices in our home and (b) the microwave doesn't run very long even when it's being used. But for others it may be important to note that all of our household appliances don't necessarily play nicely together.",
