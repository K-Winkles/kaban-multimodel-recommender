My only regret is that I didn't realize how low the wattage was on the microwave side of things. Not a big deal, things just take a little longer to heat up but I also realized some foods say not to use microwave cooking with this low wattage. Overall I am very happy the size is perfect for my limited counter space.",

                "reviewText": "While I remain disappointed by the membrane button panel on this thing (mushy, difficult), the rest is about as good as you can expect for the size, I think. Some more thoughts:Update after a few weeks....things I like:+ Narrow (I was looking for a unit to go in a 45\u00ba corner cabinet and this one is smaller laterally than the typical 21-22\" units, but does have the \"hump\" on top. Had no problem holding my dinner plates so if compact is what you're looking for, this is a good option.+ White led display is nicer than green/blue IMO, and is clear and simple (if a bit bright at night)+ Straightforward operation - intuitive, no frills control scheme that makes good use of the dial (which is properly detented to match the input it sends).+ Heats quickly, seems fairly even given the single heating element (top) thanks to what appears to be fairly aggressive fan circulation. Bread toasted pretty evenly on both sides despite there only being a top element.+ Stainless fry basket is nice; always preferred to non-stick chemical shenanigans, and is highly perforated to allow good exposure from below. Works better than I'd have guessed+ Default microwave function takes one button press (start) to initiate, and can be adjusted for time using the dial once going. This is super efficient and maybe one of the best things about this unit. Time can be adjusted the same way (dial) for other cook modes in progress.meh:\u2022 The membrane-type button panel is vague and requires enough force to occasionally move the whole unit -- in a world of capacitive touchscreens, this feels very archaic. BUT it occurs to me this is likely a lot less sensitive to wet fingers than a capacitive panel would be, and this is a worthwhile consideration in a kitchen where wet hands are a regular featureno likey:- no preheat: the timer for any toast/bake/fry session starts immediately, so you kinda need to learn how much buffer to add for coming up to initial temp. By far my biggest gripe.- Glass microwave plate must be swapped for aluminum one for radiant heating operations. My few weeks of testing seemed to alternate microwave and radiant jobs EVERY time and it is a bit bothersome to deal with the alternating platter. Make sure you install this next to a drawer or cupboard where you can store these things within reach.- (nitpicky) I had to look up how to set the clock, since the button panel is mostly occupied by presets. I'm not a fan of presets and consider this largely wasted space. Being the first interaction you have with the appliance, it's a little off-putting, but thankfully the rest of the UX/ergonomic design proved better.This is a unit for those needing the small size - it does not pack the power of larger microwaves and I suspect air fryer/toasters, but isn't exactly a slouch either; gets the job done. It offers adequate performance, noise levels, easy operation, and a regular game of musical turntables if you alternate microwave/toast functions like I did...a lot of functionality in a small, affordable package. People with small kitchens, boats, van/RVs, etc....this certainly beats the heck out of a regular microwave",

                "reviewText": "This unit showed a lot of promise. But sadly, I was disappointed.I noticed a common complaint, in the reviews of many microwave/air fryers, was that the glass dish would break from the high heat in fry mode. I didn't see any reviews mentioning this problem on this unit. Based on this, and Cuisinart's good reputation, I ordered it, even though it was one of the most expensive ovens of this type.It worked well as a microwave, though it was a bit noisy. But upon using the air fry mode for the 4th time, the glass turntable shattered from the heat!Calling to try to get a replacement was an ordeal. The voice menu had noting that I could select that would even remotely address my problem. I ended up going in an endless loop. This is not what I would expect from a brand like Cuisinart.I find it amazing that the manufacturers of these ovens have apparently never heard of Pyrex...or they are too cheap use it when the operating parameters clearly call for it. The glass table included with this oven was much more brittle and clearly of much lower quality than the dish included with my regular microwave, which doesn't get anywhere near as hot inside.I decided to return this unit for a refund.Until the manufacturers of these combo microwave/air fryers mange to work out the bugs, I recommend avoiding this type of oven.",

I hope it was just a lemon. It probably deserves another try. One drawback is it was awfully small. If I were to purchase again I would go for a little larger one.",
