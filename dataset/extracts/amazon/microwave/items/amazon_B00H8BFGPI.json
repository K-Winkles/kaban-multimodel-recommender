                "reviewText": "More than worth the money. I've used mine almost every day at work or at home for the kids. I've made many different kinds of ramen (mostly Asian ramen) literally 1000's of time with this cooker. I've eaten directly out of it 100's of times with metal utensils with no scarring or gouges evident. It's a snap to clean and I've ran it in the dishwasher almost every time I've used it. Still in great shape. Directions are embossed on the bottom with a water fill line around all sides. I tend to put mine in the microwave for 3 mins most times depending on the type/brand of ramen (in a 1000 watt microwave) stir and leave on the counter for a few minutes stirring occasionally before draining (I make all my ramen dry-ramen style). In short it's a time saver. I've had many people run their mouths about boiling water and doing it the standard method and this being pointless. I reply with the facts of the ramen being done by the time you get the water boiling, I don't have to attend it while it cooks and it doesn't make the house humid while its summer. It's also great for college students as most aren't allowed anything but a microwave in their dorm. I got another one locally for my nephew he agreed it's works great. And it works way better than just boiling water in the microwave and cooking it in a Tupperware container.",

                "reviewText": "All that is stated about this product is true. Cook your ramen noodle soups in 3 minutes. No hassle, easy peasy. However, the low water line leaves virtually no liquid in the bowl after the noodles are cooked, therefore turning your ramen noodle soup into a bowl of noodles. I have no problem with it really but I always enjoyed drinking the broth after the noodles were done. I have also noticed that no matter how hard your scrub it after use it still smells like the last ramen noodles you made. I did find that this bowl works best with Maruchan or Nissin Ramen packs best. I get a lot of the super spicy Ramen noodle sets from South Korea and unfortunately the bowl isn't big enough to cook them in. Same goes for several other Ramen noodle packs I have tried since purchasing this bowl. The sodium cut back is also an operator choice by using only part of the seasoning packet, kind of misleading on the stats of the product but it is what it is. Overall the product works great for ramen noodles and cooks them thoroughly every time.",

                "reviewText": "Ummmmm... This thing is amazing. It's a hard, red plastic that cooks one ramen cube at a time. I no longer have to wait for boiling water.I've never had success cooking ramen in the microwave until this.It is SUPER easy to clean- I basically just rinse and wipe it.I have no idea if this thing is safe for you or not, but it certainly saves time.The only thing I do not like about this, and I REALLY REALLY dislike it, is that the packaging on the front said, \"Reduces sodium up to 50%\". On the back it said that to reduce sodium, use only half the spice packet. Duh. WHY would they make a claim on the front that \"healthy cooking, reduces sodium\". It is so misleading and leads a consumer to believe that the product itself reduces sodium. I cannot believe they can get away with having that on the front of the package. It makes me feel like this company is a little dishonest.The product, though, is amazing in that it works, the noodles taste almost as good as when cooked on the stove, and it saves me the time it takes to boil water.",
