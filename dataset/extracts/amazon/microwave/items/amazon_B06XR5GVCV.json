                "reviewText": "When I took the microwave out of the package, the back corner was damaged and broken but the package box was undamaged. It still works but, when you paid $250+ for a new product, you expect a new one. So I asked for replacement. But the replacement has the same damage at the same corner while the box was undamaged. Searching in the review, I found many people reported the same broken corner at the same place. So, it was not damaged during shipping but Samsung has a horrible quality control in the product line.",

The interior wipes down easily and the glass plate that sits on the carousel can be removed for cleaning if needed. I also like the digital blue numbers. So far the operation has been great and the popcorn button works perfectly! I would recommend this product.",

                "reviewText": "I really wanted to buy a microwave that wasn't built by Midea Corp. (98% of microwaves sold in the US are--they're really all the same: google Wirecutter microwaves), because they are universally crap. I had good past experience with the brands that make their own magnatrons (Samsung, LG, and only for higher-end models, Panasonic), so I was happy to see this one on sale, deep discount. Hmm.It works fine. I use it daily. The interior capacity is awe-some... But like wow, it is freaking LOUD. BUZZ!!! Typically only for the first 10-15 seconds, and then it calms down, but for a 5-minute cook, the BUZZ can come back unexpectedly multiple times.I live in a remote area, so I'm not going to try to return it, and it works, so I'll use it, but caveat emptor. I actually have high brand loyalty for Samsung, but this unit has challenged that.",
