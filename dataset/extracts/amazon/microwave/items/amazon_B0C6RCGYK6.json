                "reviewText": "I have purchased this same little microwave four times over the years (this is the second one from Amazon) and it is PERFECT for us as a retired couple who do not need to prepare huge meals. The oven has a lower wattage (700), so I have memorized how to adjust for all cooking times, and appreciate the great ease of operating this attractive and tidy little unit! I have two suggestions to offer for those who may purchase this Magic Chef model: after reading the several negative reviews on Amazon reporting power problems with this oven, I researched general microwave safety issues online - and ANY microwaves could present electrical malfunctions. (With the four Magic Chefs I have owned, I've never experienced any problems whatsoever of that nature.) One article I read recommended that it is a very good idea to disconnect your microwave from power while it is not needed - which I do now regularly. My other suggestion is that the white enamel paint on this microwave is prone to rusting if left wet after use. Now, after every time in which humidity has formed inside my oven from the cooking process, I wipe down the interior with a paper towel to keep the rust at bay. These two steps to preserve my oven are not difficult. I definitely recommend this Magic Chef unit, and would not trade it for any other model!",

                "reviewText": "The first time I purchased this microwave it lasted over 12 years of daily use so I thought I\u2019d buy the same model again. Big mistake. I could tell from the underside and back that the interior components had changed in an apparent redesign of the original model.The quality has dropped substantially over the years to the point that it\u2019s not worth purchasing. After six months the paint on the inside started to peel off revealing bare metal. Then after 22 months it suddenly stopped working. That\u2019s an 84% shorter life span. It looks like the original long lasting model but don\u2019t be fooled. This is not a good product.",
