                "reviewText": "Awful quality. I have owned this microwave for only 3 years. If you can make out that very tiny divot in the picture that was the cause of my microwave's failure, the latch. It causes the sensors to misread when opening the door while the microwave is running. This causes the fuse to explode. It doesn't have to be that way but GE doesn't stand for quality. To replace the fuse you have to remove the entire cover! To fix the latch you have to take the door apart. While doing this work I begain to see the corners that were cut while making this product. Spots where screws should have been were empty, how much money could have been really saved from leaving out screws? The plastic is very cheap, as in it literally disintegrated while trying to work with it. I understand its an over the stove so it takes a lot of heat stress, which to me, would make sense to use higher quality materials. The latch should be made of metal so it doesn't wear out. GE made this as if it was disposable.This is a $200 microwave being marked up 3x because the slapped some useless gimicks in it. You don't need it. Also the vent function is dreadfully weak. Buy a brand that doesn't suck.",
