                "reviewText": "The size of this microwave sold me. I renovated a 1960's trailer and the fit was perfect. One year factory warranty, not in a hurry to use it. The first use, 90 days after purchase, the door latch inside the unit broke and the door won't stay closed. Light stays on, unit is inoperative. After 5 attempts to contact Avanti customer service I was informed they would not send a replacement without a technician coming to my location to attempt repair, minimum of 5 working days. I was also informed if it was not repairable a replacement couldn't be shipped because of end of year inventory. Of course, no manager available. I ended the conversation in frustration. 5 stars to Amazon, they credited me 90% of my purchase price once unit was returned with a provided free shipping label. Thank you Amazon, goodbye forever Avanti.",
