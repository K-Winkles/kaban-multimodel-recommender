It's got a larger round plastic wheel turning thingy... that ring thing the glass sits on, which is good because the glass is steadier than the one in my old microwave. The glass doesn't shift or get misaligned easily like my old one. A good value for the money. My only complaint and this is very, very minor is that it's a bit loud. Bah, not really an issue.",

My last west bend had a bigger interior. I can manufacturer would realize that not everyone has a newly two feet. You can\u2019t use an extension cord so I had to rearrange and reduce my cupboard space to accommodate the cord. In my opinion they could leave the cord a little longer. The excess could remain tied behind the appliance so it can accommodate all kitchens. Aside from that I love this microwave!Adding a note. Now that we\u2019ve been using it my son is complaining about a super high pitched noise in the kitchen. I don\u2019t hear it because I have tinnitus really bad. But we unplugged the microwave and sure enough the noise stopped. He says it gives him a headache when he\u2019s in the kitchen fixing something to eat. I\u2019ll call the company and see what answers they give me. I don\u2019t know what they can do about \u201cwhite noise\u201d.UPDATE:The noise the microwave generates is getting louder. I can hear it now over my tinnitus. It sounds like it\u2019s coming from the clock. The manufacturer refuses to do anything about the issue. They say it\u2019s not a manufacturer problem. However, we don\u2019t touch the inside mechanisms. It\u2019s never been dropped or had any accidents. It\u2019s just simply noisy. And it\u2019s getting worse with time.The manufacturer refuses to accept any responsibility for the issue. They won\u2019t do anything to help me with it. So that 1 year warranty that comes with the machine is worthless.It\u2019s beyond the 30 days so it\u2019s not returnable to Amazon.$115 dollars for a product that causes headaches and is useless to us within 90 days!",

                "reviewText": "I originally was going to replacement my microwave (yes it still works its just big and a heavy hand me down) for a slightly smaller one. Unfortunately, this is way smaller than anticipated. The positive is you can use a timer, it does microwave well, but it does slide when you attempt to open or close the door. (I suggest a mat underneath and or weight on top. No one wants to hold the microwave in order to use it.) The noise I can tolerate in my apartment, but if you are in a dorm sized living situation then this would not be ideal. Baby bottles and food are cluttered when used, and the cord is very short. Pricepoint does not match the quality of this unit, but the ease of use are very good for the buttons.",

Which is a plus. It also does 'reminder' beeps a couple times every minute until you actually withdraw your food item, which is nice too at least for me. I saw other reviews about how loud this microwave is and how people are unhappy with that. Well,from what I have experienced, the sound isn't as loud as my other microwaves. And seriously, who cares? This is my 3rd West Bend microwave and I am very pleased with this brand. Never had any problems. My previous microwave is still working I just wanted a black one to match my new convection oven better which is stainless with black. It looks pretty sharp on my countertop too. And no it isn't as large as other ovens I have seen either. TBH there really isn't anything that I don't like about this microwave. I also purch'd Asurion just in case. I dont foresee this oven going south on me though. Buy it. You'll like it!",
