                "reviewText": "I love this popcorn popper! I was really hesitant to buy it since I have horrible memories of the old air popcorn poppers that left the popcorn as dry as the desert. However, I was trying out the Weight Watchers app and saw that popcorn (with no oil) is zero points, so I decided to give it a try. Wow! I am amazed at how good the popcorn is! It is so easy to make; I put 1/4 cup of popcorn in it and is less than 2 minutes I have a hearty serving of delicious popcorn. I spritz it with a little spray butter and popcorn salt and it is the perfect snack! The kernels pop up plump and not dry at all. The popper is really easy to clean and collapses down well to store easily. You really need to try this!",

Microwave popcorn seems to pop it very similar but often has a gritty texture from the artificial flavorings and such I\u2019m guessing. I was on the verge of buying a small movie theater popper... but the space it would take up and then having to put oil in it and such... wasn\u2019t really feasible on many fronts for me. Then I came across this. Are you kidding? Movie theater quality pop, virtually no space taken up, and a clean preparation perfect for my healthier avocado oil and sea salt blend!",

                "reviewText": "I have no trouble making my popcorn on the stove top. But sometimes I just don't want to fool around with oil, etc. So I bought this product. I am experimenting. For the first batch, I used the \"Popcorn\" button on my microwave. Terrible results: 23 g of unpopped kernels out of 85 g of kernels to start with. So nuts to the \"Popcorn\" button. I tried 4 more times to find the right combination of factors. Unpopped kernels are still a problem for me - 3 g, 4 g, 6 g, then 8 g of unpopped kernels when starting with 57 g, 85 g (85 g = 3 ounces), 57 g, and 50 g, respectively. Why is it getting worse? Next, I will try putting the product on a turned-over glass pie tray to lift the kernels from lower in the microwave (the Whirlpool microwave does have a turntable). I am hoping to find the \"sweet spot\" of actual heating energy. At some point, I will also see if any of the unpopped kernels pop on the stove top. I do like the texture and flavor of the popcorn. It is light and fluffy. And fast to make. So perhaps my microwave just sucks. Until more experiments are conducted, I consider the jury still out on this popcorn popper. I don't know how people get almost zero unpopped kernels. As a Virgo, I would love to find the secret to this mystery.",
