The buttons are at an inconvenient spot so when you open the microwave you accidently turn on the insanely loud fan sometimes. The light for cooktop goes out quickly and is expensive to replace. BUT rhe major issue is the magnetron that heats went out after a year and half. The warranty only covers one year. The magi has a 10 year part warranty but you are required to pay for them to install it. They quoted me $220-$290 for a microwave that\u2019s being sold for around $400. It\u2019s insane. They won\u2019t let you have to part to install yourself. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY THIS EXPENSIVE HUNK OF JUNK",
