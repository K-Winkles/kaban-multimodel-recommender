                "reviewText": "We've had one of these for a decade. Ours is wall-mounted above a Dacor conventional gas oven. The only problem we've had prior to now with it is that it has a heat switch, and if you leave the oven door below open while it's running that can trip the heat switch which requires a service tech visit to reset. Even though this is about a 5 minute fix, a typical homeowner can't fix this, requires removal of the front wall installation plate and some product knowledge. Other than that it has worked great, until today. Because ours is a decade old, we are debating fixing versus replacing, but if we replace we'll get the same unit.",
