                "reviewText": "I like having a hot breakfast at work, so I've been spending $3.00+ a pop on those Jimmy Dean Simple Scrambles. While still cheaper than buying take out, I realized how much this was quickly adding up and started to look up microwave egg cookers. After some research I ordered the OXO brand. I'm very happy with this product!Yes, technically one could use a bowl to cook my eggs, but I prefer this because it's easier to clean, it disassembles and it has a vented lid.To address some of the negative reviews:1) I have been using this almost daily for a month and there have been no leaks whatsoever. Also, I have cooked up to three eggs at a time and the bottom has never popped out.2) I have put this in the dishwasher a few times and nothing has warped.3) Nothing sticks to the bottom, I do get a scant amount of egg residue on the middle ring that easily wipes away with a sponge (although for full transparency, I have only cooked scrambled eggs in the container)3) Your eggs will cook quickly (I check my eggs around the 50 second mark, add cheese and cook more about 20-30 more seconds) - I don't advise to put them in the microwave then walking away.If anything changes, I will amend my review.",

                "reviewText": "I use this to make English muffin breakfast sandwiches at home. Crack a couple of eggs in the Egg Cooker, light mixing of the eggs, season and microwave. The way the top and bottom separate make for easy removal of the egg which makes for such quick and ease of use. Also, with the ease of separation of pieces makes for easy clean up either by hand or in the dishwasher.If you are an \"English Muffin Egg Sandwich\" lover, get this and make your own!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this to cook the egg for my homemade breakfast egg muffin sandwich. It does a great job and it is the right size. You do need to coat the bottom with either a cooking spray or butter (I use butter). This step isn't necessary for the egg to slide off the bottom plate, but it does help tremendously in allowing the egg to release cleanly off the bottom plate. I did try using it for scrambled eggs and honestly because you have to stop and stir the eggs midway through the cooking process it isn't really a time saver. It makes a better omelet than scrambled egg. I just scramble my eggs the traditional way in a skillet.",

                "reviewText": "These are good little egg cookers that make it almost painless to have a scrambled egg/omlette for breakfast. They are just deep enough to whisk the ingredients in and cook them in one minute (at 900w/one and a half minutes for two eggs), and the cover ensures that you don't have to worry about the roof of your microwave being caked in napalmed egg afterwards. A little oil (sprayed then brushed) around the base also means that they clean pretty much instantly. The finished result is a perfectly round \"cake\" that fits inside a muffin, bun or mini wrap. I tried to \"fry\" an egg in it, but it seems you have to constantly check on the state, so, IMO, it isn't really worth the hassle.",
