It is super easy to use and she got the hang of it in an evening without much help from me even though I did explain it to her. It replaced an older microwave that had died after a decade and was a beast. This newer one was an obvious improvement, the carousel is a feature she did not have on her older model and it is larger but far more energy efficient. A good value and a very quiet microwave.",

                "reviewText": "I was replacing my very old Sharp Carousel II microwave that I've had forever. I had washed it inside too vigorously with a very wet sponge the other day and it no longer worked. It was completely my fault. I loved that microwave and I wanted one just like it. Luckily I found this Sharp microwave online. It has no handle (and I didn't want a handle) - just like the old one. It's absolutely beautiful to look at and it works so far like a charm. I'm so happy with it. The only issue I had with it is that it arrived so thoroughly wrapped and packed in with styrofoam, I was unable to get it out of the box. I needed the help of the a/c repairman who happened to be in the house, and he was having difficulty too. Finally, he had to cut both of the boxes (the outside shipping box and the inside product box) completely on all four sides, and he lifted the microwave onto my counter. As I said, it is just beautiful, has all the settings you could possibly want, and works like a charm. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great microwave. UPDATE: 6 months later, I still love this microwave. It has never let me down, and it continues to look beautiful. Not one complaint. I recommend it highly.",

                "reviewText": "This item was delivered on 08/25/17. I unboxed it on 08/28/17 and have used it maybe once once per day (some days not at all) since then for very minor things like 2 and 1/2 minutes to heat water for a cup of tea, or 3 to 4 minutes to reheat a meal. It certainly has seen minimal use and nothing major, and, since I live alone, I know it's been treated very gently and has never been abused. I liked most of the features (the kitchen timer & interior light when cooking AND when door is open), though some features are stupid & irritating, like the pre-programmed 1 to 6 numbers on the keypad. Anyway, today is 10/11/17 and after 5 weeks of very light use, I was just getting to the point of trusting that I could now safely throw away the outer carton it was shipped in. I planned on putting it out in next week's trash since the unit SEEMED to be working just fine. Well, today it no longer works. Upon attempting to heat water for a cup of tea this morning, I noticed that the oven was dark. The light no longer works, nor does the microwave itself. After less than 6 weeks of minimal use, it just stopped working. The Amazon return window closed two weeks ago at the 30 day point on 09/25/17 so I am out of luck and out over $120.00 for this Chinese-made piece of Junk. ... I had bought my first Sharp Carousel Microwave in 1993 and it lasted WITH ZERO PROBLEMS for more than 20 years. When that died in 2013, I bought another Sharp that shockingly lasted only about 4 years. Figuring this must be a fluke, I again chose Sharp and this time it lasted ONLY FIVE WEEKS!!!! ...REALLY????!!!! ...As far as I'm concerned Sharp has stolen my money. Seriously, I am now out over $120.00 and have no working microwave and cannot return this giant paperweight for a functioning one. Aside from my significant financial loss, just think of what this \"planned obsolescence\" garbage is doing to our planet. Yup, after a mere five weeks of use, this hunk of junk, its two cardboard cartons, styrofoam, & packing materials are all headed to the landfill, along with my cash. This disregard for our planet is DISPICABLE!!!! SHAME ON YOU, SHARP!",

                "reviewText": "Bought this to replace our 20-year-old Sharp microwave. It was still working well, but we broke the glass plate, and the cost to replace it was almost as much as a new microwave. My first thought was that it looked small, but the interior dimensions were the same as the old one, so that's great! We've had it for about 6 weeks now, and it works well for how we use it - mainly for cooking fresh or frozen veggies or reheating plates of food. I really like the auto-sensor feature of the Sharp! There are a few things that I don't care for:1. We used to make popcorn in a paper lunch sack, which you can't do anymore. I searched several brands, and the manuals all tell you not to do this. I found out why - the popcorn now burns in the bag, and could start a fire. We ended up getting one of those glass corn poppers for the microwave, and it's ok, but I really miss doing it in the bag - nothing to wash.2. As the carousel turns, it makes a rattling noise. I have re-seated it several times, but the noise continues.3. The area between the layers of glass in the door steams up, making it difficult to see inside the microwave when you're using it. This is especially frustrating when I'm making caramel sauce - you have to see when the sugar mixture just begins to turn a light amber color, and I can't see into the microwave to check it.Everything else about this microwave is great. I hope this one lasts as long as the other one did!",

                "reviewText": "I like that this microwave is easy to use and offers different convenience buttons such as \"melt\" for butter. I'm not sure what \"thickness\" means so I only gave it 3 stars. This microwave exterior is larger than my old Sharp so it doesn't fit as well as I like. I have purchased Sharp microwave several times and am always pleased with it. My last one was over 20 years old. I hope to get the same from this model.",

(Note that one reason we bought this specific unit was because a similar Sharp model -- with a door handle -- turned out to make too much noise when the door was closed. It tended to slam shut, whereas the push-button door open mechanism on this unit can be gently pressed to close door more quietly, like at night when some folks are sleeping.)",
