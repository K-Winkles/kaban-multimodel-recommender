                "reviewText": "I have only used the Microwave Sandwich Maker twice. I am very pleased with the results. It works as advertised. I have a LG 1000 watt microwave, so I decreased the cooking time on each side to 90 seconds instead of the two minutes as suggested in the directions. The directions are apparently written for a 900 watt microwave. I followed the advice of some of the reviewers. I preheated the Microwave Sandwich Maker for 2 minutes on high. I then placed the sandwich in the Microwave Sandwich Maker and cooked it according to the directions for both sides. The result gave me a very nicely toasted sandwich. I even added meat to the second sandwich.A few reviewers lamented the panini marks left by the heating places. Though I have not tried it, I would suggest turning the heating plates over which would most likely satisfy most users. Personally, I found nothing wrong with the grate indentations/marks left by the Microwave Sandwich Maker.I placed Microwave Sandwich Maker in the dishwasher and it came out nice and clean. For a thorough cleaning, remove the silicone holders from the heating plates before washing. They go back on quite easily.The only criticism I would make is not of the Microwave Sandwich Maker itself, but of the directions that are provided with it. They are very limited and over simplified. No mention is made of preheating the Microwave Sandwich Maker, which I think is an important step. Do be aware that once heated in the microwave, the Microwave Sandwich Maker is HOT!Important Note: As I stated previously, I have only used the Microwave Sandwich Maker twice. If I discover problems later, then I will revise my review accordingly. At this time, I am sold on the product.",

                "reviewText": "2 complaints: This doesn't work perfectly for rectangular \"gourmet\" wider pre-sliced bread since it is only \"normal bread\" sized, but it's still okay for that. Also, I was hoping there was a \"flat\" side to the plates that doesn't have \"grill mark\" ridges but that isn't the case. For regular cheap sandwich bread and smaller it works great. My wife likes to make grilled cheese with about twice the normal thickness of cheese on gluten-free bread, which doesn't seem to conduct heat as well as normal bread. This works perfect for that. Overall, pretty good. One other thing, you pretty much have to disassemble to wash in the dishwasher, which isn't hard, then shake the water out of the crevices afterward.",

                "reviewText": "At first, I loved the panini references and pictures. But after using it several times, I'm not sure that I'm a big fan. Unlike a frying pan, which grills just the outer few millimeters of the bread leaving the inner portion moist and soft, this unit dries out the whole bread. There is no \"moist and soft\" interior part. It's all dried out. You can go from undercooked to brick in just a few seconds. As an experiment with my son, we made 2 cheese sandwiches. We used the same bread, the same cheese, at room temperature, and with both slices of bread prepped with butter. One sandwich we cooked the traditional way, in a frying pan, and with the second we used this Sandwich Maker. We adhered to the manufacturer's instructions throughout the whole experiment. The results weren't even close. The sandwich that was grilled in the frying pan was cooked to a golden brown (although no panini grill marks), the cheese was perfectly melted, and the sandwich was moist with a buttery taste. The Panini Sandwich Maker, on the other hand, was dry as can be and had us reaching for milk/water with every bite. More importantly, there was no buttery taste and no sense of \"crust on the outside and moist melted cheese on the inside.\" It was not pleasant. All we could taste was crunchy, dried out bread with a hint of dried out cheese. It should be noted that we tried this experiment twice. The first time at the recommended microwave time of 2 minutes per side, and the second, shaving 30 seconds off each side, of 1.5 minutes each side. The only difference was that the 2 minute/side was darker. Other than that, the dryness, dehydration, and loss of flavor was the same. I would LOVE a microwave product that truly replicates the ooey-gooeyness of a good grilled sandwich, but this product missed the mark by a lot. I will not purchase another one.",

                "reviewText": "I love this item. I use it to make several different types of sandwiches. I highly recommend using a paper plate under the sandwich maker to collect any dripping and to make cleaning up easier. I make hamburgers from frozen and cook for less than 4 minutes depending on the size and weight of the burger. Burger comes out cooked and very juicy. Burger is NOT dry like I expected it to be. Note that the press gets very hot so be extra careful when removing it from the microwave. Highly recommend",

                "reviewText": "Things like chicken nuggets and wontons get soggy when heated in the microwave. This device makes them hot and crispy. Vegetables like asparagus and mushrooms get soggy when heated in the microwave. This device gives them grill marks and keeps the vegetables firm. The microwaves themselves do not penetrate the metal plate, therefore, the food inside is only heated by the plates themselves, and not by microwaves. This might mean two or more minutes longer, but the results are worth it. In the time it takes to heat a frying pan to do the same job, you can get crispy and healthy food. The small version is small - good for portion control. But you need the larger version if you feed more than yourself. This is an excellent buy.",
