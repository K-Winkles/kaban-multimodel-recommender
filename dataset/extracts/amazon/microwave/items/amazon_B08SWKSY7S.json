Item acts as a little hanging line for the Bacons I can cook a whole pack at a time if I hang them tight. Couple minutes in microwave and you\u2019re done. It also collects the drippings on the bottom so that I could use to cook my eggs and meat if I want.Some cons-the interior bacon does not cook as fast as the ones hanging exterior.-Also the cleanup is not as simple since you have to take the item apart and soak to make sure you get all the grease off.Overall I love my little bacon maker and I use it twice a week.",
