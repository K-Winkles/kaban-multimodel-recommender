                "reviewText": "Along with hot air poppers the microwave popper is equally effective as it allows the popping of popcorn 100% oil free, so no additional calories are added other than for the 1/2 pound of calorie dense butter, which turns popcorn into an edible treat. The popper discs do have a life which usually ends when holes are eroded into the material, causing the disc to lift off the bottom of the popper bowl. When this happens the unpopped seeds settle down to the bottom, where they all remain unpopped, so need to be sorted out and added to the next attempt. Each disc will endure 20-30 uses, so in the larger schemes of things is relatively inexpensive. Using a disc beyond its life may cause the popcorn to ignite.",

Place cup at bottom of bowl, add popcorn kernels, then just enough oil to cover the kernels and fire up the microwave. At 800w I dial in 4 min but listen for the popping to slow down but not until it stops, (actually about 3,5 min) turn off and you will have wonderful popcorn, much better than at the movie theaters /kinos. If I could, I would bring my own popcorn to the movies. Enjoy!",
