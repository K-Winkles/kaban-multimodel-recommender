I broke my shoulder a few years ago and can not raise it fully, so having a microwave drawer was safer for me instead of having hot things above my 4'10\" height. The microwave works beautifully. My only complaint is the roughness that was displayed by the delivery man. Upside down and handled rough i was afraid it wouldn't work as I saw him throwing things around in truck.Love all the features.",
