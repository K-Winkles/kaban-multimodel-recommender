                "reviewText": "I shopped around before I chose this unit. I had read all of the bad reviews ahead of time, but I thought I would give it a try anyway because it checked all of my boxes.Pros:*It is small enough for servings for 2 but large enough to do for 4 people.*It comes with a paddle, measuring cup, rice washer /strainer (other units you have to buy these separate)*It is a quality thick material, not flimsy plastic like the cheaper brands*It's not just for riceCons for me:1. First of all, it says on page 2 that the guidelines are based on an 800 watt microwave. In the USA anyway, that is the small microwaves that are used in apartments or dorms. Most units these days for families, are at least 1000W (I just bought a new one with no frills and it's 1100W). With this in mind, it probably WOULD take 30 minutes to cook rice at 800W as the instructions suggest. I used whole grain rice and set it for 20 minutes (this is what I normally set the timer for to cook on the stove top) instead of the 30 minutes they suggest. Do I really want to have to \"guess' each time I want to cook something?2. *Problem #1 - I put the spoon on top,seated on the little button. I assumed that it showed it like that was so that it would \"hold down\" the lid to keep it from boiling over as so many other people said they had issues with . What happened is that yes, I did not have any boil over, however, the spoon then was so hot I could not grab ahold of it. (yes, I waited the 5 minutes it suggests)To ensure your rice will have a consistent texture, and to eliminate any pesticides that may still be on the grain, it is always best to wash your rice before cooking it. This also gets rid of excess starch, which helps to create less foam that bubbles over while cooking rice, but always be sure to check the packaging on your rice first. Some rice comes enriched with water-soluble vitamins and minerals, which will dissolve if the rice is rinsed. *Problem #2 - The indentations (handle) they have for grasping the cover to remove it are just barely visible, much less able to use. Even when the pot is cold there is nothing to grip, and when it's hot - forget it. The suction created inside is too much to lift the lid. I had to get a fork to pry it open. So now I had a paddle that was too hot to hold, and a cover with a design flaw making it so you can't even get to your food.3. In the section of the booklet : \"How To Cook Perfect Rice\", it says to \"check the moisture regularly throughout cooking. Do not allow rice or grains to become dry or overheat.\" ummm..isn't it supposed to be a \"pressure cooker\" to steam the rice? If you have to keep opening the lid (which I already said is nearly impossible), how is the rice supposed to have enough moisture to cook?All in all it's a practical option for someone who wants to cook grains every now and then and due to my \"Pros\" list I gave it 4 stars, but on a daily basis I think it's too much trouble. I'm going to go back and re-visit some of my other choices before I make a final decision.**UPDATE: I went back and searched again for other options and found a different seller with a different product that was the \"same\". It looks similar, but it \"fixes\" all of the issues I had with this one.",

Usually enough to leave a small puddle on the glass microwave dish it sits on. If that isn't a big deal for you, mentally add another star. If you add a bit of butter or oil as suggested to supress boil over, it still does it and makes clean up messy. The booklet says its built for an 800 watt microwave. I have adjusted down the power on mine, but it has only a small effect.In the end, I still like it, but disappointed. It would not be difficult to give it a V flare, wider at the top, to suppress foaming and boil over.",

                "reviewText": "This does a fairly nice job as a rice cooker. The capacity is generous and and even on quite large loads has not boiled over (though I take their advice and add a little oil to help with that). I have made a mountain of lovely fluffy rice in this without issue. I have had less success using it on pasta so far; I don't think their guidelines are right for my microwave or my pasta. The one negative I will raise is that the inside basket is quite difficult to dispense from directly; the handle does not lend itself to allowing it to be tipped to disgorge its contents. I have to grip the basket in a tablecloth and then dispense from it that way. The handle is only really effective for removing the basket from the outer vessel.",
