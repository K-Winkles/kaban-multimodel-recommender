Customer service on follow up told me they had diagnosed remotely and were waiting for part. Next follow up with customer service was given a local number to call for me to follow up on my own on status of service. Called local number, they are at least two weeks out on scheduling (no word on ordering part as on previous call to customer service). Directed to call back in a week to see if my service call even scheduled yet. Worst appliance purchase I have ever made.Sept 2002 update. Expecting second replacement shortly (third unit). First replacement was mishandled, came with broken ceramic tray and very noisy opening mechanism. Hope third time is the charm.March 2023 update. Microwave no longer working. Bought extended warranty and now Sharp and warranty company arguing about who is going to cover repair. Getting run around yet again.",

                "reviewText": "Beautiful addition to my kitchen. I've been using it for 3 months now and I still don't get why the negative reviews - it's a beautiful microwave & the airfryer crisps nuggets & fries perfectly. Yes a few minutes longer but that's all. It's very pretty too. I agree the alexa app & wifi needs work but I expected that and there will be updates Im sure. Just like everynwofi product. The drawer is very easy to use if you take the time to learn how to use it! There's a learning curve but it's worth it. My family loves it. And now we don't even think about it. Plus it's just as quick as an 1100 unit. People just don't have patience to learn. This is not a countertop or under the hood microwave. You need to read and learn. But once you do it's amazing. My family enjoys cooking with it or just to heat up soup. I feel Sharp put a lot of executive chef creative design into this product. Glad I did not listen to the negative reviews. It's definitely state of the art and impressive. That said, if you just want a microwave to slap around and not learn how to use it, well then, this is not for you. We use it all day - from popcorn to reheating, airfrying and yes toast - but it's not a toaster. It crisps the bread. And it perfectly defrosts ground beef /food without cooking edges. We even baked a few frozen chocolate chip cookie dough & they came out delightful. Nice appliance. It's a chef microwave that's classy & really nice to have. And very easy to use if you use it right.",

I had to microwave a bag of popcorn the other day for 5-6 minutes to get it to pop at all and still had a handful of unpopped kernels at the bottom. Had I known this was the case I would not have spent the money. Microwaving is supposed to shorten cooking time . I did call the company to check to make sure that this is the way it's supposed to operate as I thought perhaps it wasn't functioning properly but was told that everything will take twice as long. I have not used any of the other features yet but plan to to see if everything else takes twice as long. If it does, this is a real rip off and an expensive one.",
