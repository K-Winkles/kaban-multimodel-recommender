                "reviewText": "\u200eFantastic! Toshiba \u200eML-EC42P(SS) 4 function Microwave / Air Fryer / Convection / CombinationBefore I get into MY review I'd like to address someone else's review.====================When I was checking out the Microwaves, I stumbled across a review for THIS one that claimed that you couldn't type in the time to microwave, and so were stuck with 1 to 6 minutes, and then you were forced to press the \"More\" or \"Less\" buttons raising or lowering the time by one minute. Or using the \"Start / Play\" button to ad 30 seconds. Limiting the times you can microwave starting at 30 Seconds, 1 to 6:30: .5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5 Minutes. Though you can add more minutes by pressing \"More\". If this were true, this would be a HORRIBLE microwave, as we know that a handful of seconds can be the difference between perfectly cooked food and burned or overcooked food.She doesn't know what she's talking about, obviously didn't read the manual OR EVEN LOOK at the keypad.You CAN work it like she described, though I don't know WHY you'd WANT TO! First, she describes ONLY using the Quick Start buttons, which are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and, if we're being honest, the \"Play\" Button (adding 30 seconds to the total, each time you press it). In conjunction with the \"More\" and \"Less\" buttons, adding or subtracting 1 minute at a time.All of this is explained in the manual.But, if you're not a \"Manual\" kind of person, then you only need to read the keypad. If a person does that, he or she will run into 3 buttons directly above the number-pad:Micro, Conv, and Combo. (With an Airfry button one line underneath the top left row.) With just the lightest application of \"the Little Grey Cells\" a reasonably intelligent child would be able to be able to make these associations: Micro = Microwave Conv = Convection Combo = Microwave then Convection CookingIf you press the Micro Button, the unit displays, \"00:00:00\" and if you start typing in the time that you want, it will start filling up time by inserting each new number at the right-most spot. So if you type \"100\" the unit will display \"00:01:00\", and if you add a number 2 the display will show \"00:10:02\", or 10 Minutes and 2 Seconds. As you can see, it's not too complicated.Review review is over. My review continues below.The \u200eML-EC42P(SS) is a fantastic machine!I had some concerns about this machine:1) Microwave is only 1,000 Watts. Danger of under-cooking. More and more foods say they \"Require\" 1,200 Watts,2) Air Fryer might be wimpy.3) Some reviews say the manual is confusing.PROS:1) Manual isn't bad. I've read MUCH WORSE. Just read it a few times, and keep it handy for referring to it when you're confused.2) That it is a 1000 Watt oven is rarely an issue. But when it is, you can extend the time by a few seconds, or minutes.3) Air Fryer does a really decent job! Sometimes it takes MORE time than using the microwave (for instance, \"Hot Pockets\") would be. But it's a \"Set-it and Forget-it\" deal, and produces MUCH better results. (For instance, microwaving 2 Hot Pockets takes 2 or 3 minutes, while \"Airfrying\" takes about 13 minutes. But, the unit turns itself off after it's done.4) The Convection function can either heat to a specific temperature (Press: Conv->Set Temperature->Play->Play), OR it can cook for a SPECIFIC length of time (Press: Conv->Set Temperature->Play->Type in Time to Cook->Play).5) Auto Defrost works like a charm!CONS:1) Flat, smooth, bubble Keys / Buttons kind of to press / find. No bumps or lines to distinguish where they start or stop. I slide my finger across the button I want to press. 95% success.2) Only 1000 Watts.3) Keypad NOT backlit.4) Keypad / Display can be hard to read.4) Not smart.",

Easy wipe clean up inside and out. The only problem is you can't see the number panel if the light is off. You even have you either have to open the door of the microwave and put your finger on the button or turn the light on in the room. Too bad engineers haven't figured out how to make the buttons glow in the dark or backlite them ....and they're not either. I don't think any of them are. Are they?My last microwave was the same you could'nt see the number panel in the dark.",

                "reviewText": "Update: Around Mar 1 2021 this stopped responding to Alexa due to an update to the Msmartlife app. Alexa integration cannot be restored, the new MS app will not even open. I would not be quite so bothered by this were it not for the fact that the app/Alexa integration is necessary to access all the microwave presets. I am not the only one with this issue. It's even in the app reviews Alexa still shows the microwave skill as enabled.So, I might as well have saved my money and kept my not smart microwave. THIS SHOULD NOT BE STILL BEING SOLD AS ALEXA ENABLED. IT'S NOT.The microwave itself is just great, fast, nice presets, bright interior light, amazingly quiet, has worked well with everything I've tried. When I bought this I was in the market for an 1100W smallish microwave with smart sensor. I found the non Alexa enabled model and was about to buy that when I saw this for not much more and I have Alexa and an Echo Dot and had managed to add a Bluetooth speaker and Roku TV, found that handy and effortless, intuitive to do. Setting this up was anything but easy, effortless, intuitive despite the fact I followed step by step instructions and watched several YouTube videos. I had no trouble downloading the MSmartLife app both from the Google store and using the QR code after adding a QR reader to my phone. But after a number of tries and installing and deleting the app I could not get past the initial screen agreeing to and accepting terms and conditions. I did finally get this to work and was able to connect the microwave and add it to Alexa but it took hours and probably years off my life. I used the voice control to pop corn and this morning to boil water for instant cappuccino without going into the kitchen, saving three steps and a minute and a half. Using presets and sensor settings with Alexa requires using the exact script in the manual p17. I would not know how to use all presets/sensor settings without Alexa, this is not in the manual I have, anywhere.",

It is beautiful, easy to use, and clean. Very much pleased with this product.",

                "reviewText": "When we first bought this microwave, I had a bit of trouble setting it up but eventually was able to make it work using the MSmartLife app as recommended in the instructions. However, as others have noted, it worked for a couple of days (long enough to get us addicted to the feature) and then stopped working. I struggled with it for several days and eventually convinced Amazon to take it back. We got a replacement and I could not get it to connect to Alexa at all. I phoned customer support at Amazon and I have to give them 5 stars. The person walked me through the procedure to fix the problem and it worked. This involved unplugging the microwave, reconnecting to MSmartLife, then disabling the MSmartLife skill in Alexa and re-enabling the skill. Following this it worked. The photo was taken after asking Alexa to microwave for 2 1/2 minutes and as you can see it worked. I don\u2019t know if I will have to redo this every two days but will post an update in a week or two. The microwave itself is great but the Alexa feature, when it works is fabulous.Update: a week later, I have had to reprogram Alexa\u2014just disabling MSmartLife and re-enabling seems to work. Other Canadians have indicated that this app doesn\u2019t work in Canada, but so far, it has worked for us.",
