                "reviewText": "Microwave worked decently for 11 months, then started making interesting noises at the end of the 12th month. It stopped working altogether at 12 months + 2 weeks and when we had Frigidaire's guy out to repair it he stated it was unrepairable and the whole thing would have to be replaced. REPLACED. Frigidaire, on being informed of this, stated that the microwave was no longer under warranty and that they weren't going to replace it.Something stops working two weeks out of warranty? That's really, really horrible, but might be workable-- you pay for parts, I'll pay for labor. Work with me because you know it's not right and you might keep a customer.But something is completely destroyed (that's what \"unrepairable\" means) two weeks out of warranty, and you expect me to eat the entire $900+ cost for a year of acceptable operation?SERIOUSLY?!? Are you TRYING to lose high-end customers? Because that's what you do when you treat them this way. Do you honestly think my next expensive microwave will be a Frigidaire if that's what I'm to expect?Machine was decent... while it worked. But our treatment after it catastrophically broke, barely out of warranty? Horrible.",

Now left with a giant hole in our island in a 22 month old new house. I would NOT recommend this microwave.",
