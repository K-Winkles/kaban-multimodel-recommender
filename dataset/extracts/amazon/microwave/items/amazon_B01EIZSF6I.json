                "reviewText": "My old microwave finally gave up the ghost after around 13-14 years of pretty decent service. I mostly warm up meals and made-for-microwave entrees, and of course the obligatory batch of popcorn from time to time. Saw this pop up and it had pretty good reviews. Plus, I've owned Farberware products going back decades. I still have a Farberware Percolator coffee-maker that's probably pushing 40 now, and a small countertop convection oven that I've been using almost daily for 16+ years. So I'm pretty cool with the brand.It has a much smaller footprint than the old microwave, but curiously has pretty close to the same sized heating chamber for capacity. This is rated for 1000w, and it definitely warms/cooks things much faster than the old unit. I can cook a full bowl of popcorn in 3 minutes in this one, whereas it took 4:30 in the former microwave. The front panel is sleek and simple, and for most things it'll do just fine. If you want to warm something for 5 minutes, you just push the 5 button on the pad and walk away. It takes care of the rest. However, I think it's unusually fiddly when you want to input a very specific cook time, like 3m20s. Yes, you can do it. But you have to go through this whole process of setting the power level first, then inputting the total cook time. It's just a bit of extra keypresses when you need a very particular cook duration.It also seems a bit noisier to my ears than the old unit. Not necessarily standing under a jet engine noisy, but it's definitely noticeable. I got used to it within the first few days, and it's not that big a deal since I live alone, but if you're given to late night kitchen raids and want to avoid waking the wife and kids, this one is going to thump and hum a bit.For under $100, I have no complaints. If it holds up as long as my other Farberware items, I should be set for the rest of my days. And if not, this didn't break the bank, so it's all good. For the cost and the efficiency I gave it 5 stars, with the caveats about the time input and noise. If you can put up with those, it's a great value.",

                "reviewText": "Bought in June 2017, still works great 6 yrs later! I really wanted a small countertop microwave that was stainless and white. So many are black and would've stood out in my light colored kitchen. This one has been great, no issues or malfunctions, the door opens and closes, turntable spins, etc. The only inconvenience is that the light bulb went out and I haven't bothered to replace it yet. As mentioned in other reviews, the interior is rather dim so it is hard to see your food even if the lightbulb works. (Part of that might be because the screen is white, so your eyes don't adjust to \"see through it\" to the inside as easily as a black screen.) We just got used to stopping the time and opening the door to check on stuff.***Also, highly recommend the white magnetic shelf seen on the side of my pic. Comes in a 2-pack and easily holds boxes of tea or glass spice jars without falling or slipping. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DDBV6ZW/",

I like the gray interior, it will probably be easier to keep looking clean. I don't know why a lot of people are calling this microwave noisy. Mine is definitely quieter than the microwave it replaced. The best thing is popcorn function on this microwave is almost magical. It pops the entire bag, without burning a single piece, and I'm only left with like 4 or 5 un-popped kernels in the bag.",

It did arrive with a small dent in the door and one on the front. Obviously careless handling en route. The red color is really nice. And it\u2019s pretty roomy inside. I like that it has a \u201ckitchen timer\u201d since my stove timer died. If you need a small microwave, I would recommend this one.",

More importantly, it has a door handle! I hate the ones where you have to push to open the door. Oddly enough, it has the one thing I don't like in microwaves, and that is it continues to beep even when the door is opened, and can't be programmed off. However, the sound is quite tolerable on this oven. I like everything about it: the size, the number pad, the wattage (1000), and the door handle! I looked a long time before getting this microwave; it's perfect.",

                "reviewText": "My other microwave suddenly died & had no choice but to find one online, as I got injured & could not get out to shop for several days. This was the only model that I liked the look of that also fit into the exact cabinet space we'd had custom-made for the now-dead one, so a no-brainer.It also had good reviews, so was hoping to just kind of like it. Instead, I am very very happy with it.First worry was that it has a lower wattage than my other one did, but so far, no problem or appreciable difference in the speed of cooking. This one is very used friendly (other one was never that) & took almost no time to learn the new methods and buttons. I was worried I would not like the grey interior, having always had white ones, but it, too, is so much nicer than expected, and I doubt I will ever again buy one with a white interior. It cleans so easily, and looks beautiful. I'd buy this one again in a flash!And yes, as other reviewers have said, it is not a silent one! Noisy, yes, more than my last two were, but who cares? The stove, the regular wall oven, the blender, freezer, and mixers all make noise in use. I never expect to be cooking or working in a quiet kitchen! :)",
