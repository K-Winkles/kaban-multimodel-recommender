                "reviewText": "UPDATE - after 1 year of ownership - DEC 2021I hate this microwave. The power flicked off for about 1 second last week. Ever since the microwave reverted to it's default cry-baby settings where it will give a loud beep-beep-beep if you don't get the food out within 8 seconds ... then reminds you again 10 seconds later.... and again...and again. This POS will remember my wifi password (still worthless), but won't remember to stop with all the beeping.The user interface was designed by the architects of \"The Good Place\", with a 'feature' that turns out to make everything worse. Want to reduce the power, it can do that ... after 5 button presses! Want heat up that coffer, it can do that ... press the button, insert drink, wait for it to finish opening, press close, press start (HAHA, just kidding, you have to wait 7 more seconds for the door to close), then press start.Still looks pretty.ORIGINAL REVIEW - Dec 2020 (on BBuy, which wont let me update)Drawer microwaves and this model in particular look great. We did a big reno in December and this is now in the island. Looks good and functions as a basic microwave. Everything else is just south of mediocre. I'd suggest you get a drawer microwave from another company.Bad Stuff:- door opens/closes very slowly (~4 seconds)... doing a 30 second reheat now takes 4+4+30+4+4 = 50% longer just standing around. Likely similar with other drawers, but an unexpected negative.- doesn't let you tell it to start until fully closed- its default sounds and reminders are ridiculously annoying - beep-beep-beep on finish, and 10 seconds after that, and 10 seconds after that, and.... on and on- it forgets all settings during a power outage, turning back on the annoying sounds- and forgets your network connection - but good news, you won't want to use that feature- controls are not intuitive - classic 40 buttons where you use 5The WiFi & App - hilariously bad. Design in your head the things you would want in a microwave app. Sharp engineers designed the opposite. Can you set the alarm settings in the app? No. Do you get a notification each time the microwave finishes cooking? Yes. I guarantee you will delete the app within 48 hours.Hand Wave to open. Neat right? No. Take how long it takes for this thing to open/close and add another 4-8 seconds of waving your hands (which are full food, else you'd just press the button) to then wait for the drawer to open. Push to close works well, but it reacts in a weird way, so some concern i'm breaking it. I stopped doing wave to open after the first week and stopped trying to demonstrate it to friends after one month (cause it will make you look silly).Height - just tall enough - fits a Venti coffeeCooks at 950watts - basically the same power as a college-dorm microwaveCost. my god, how much did i spend on this.The good:Looks goodFlush install if you have a good installer; mine is shown in a 30\" wide lower microwave cabinet by MedallionReheat sensor cook works wellbump to close worksIt was suggested that I buy a Sharp because they have the patent on the drawer microwave and everyone else is just a relabeled Sharp. I would suggest you give the others a look. They may be using the same hardware, but hopefully they have a more customer-focused interface and better software engineers working for them.",
