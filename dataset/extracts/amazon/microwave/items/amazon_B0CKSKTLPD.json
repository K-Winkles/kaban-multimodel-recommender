                "reviewText": "Needed a microwave that would fit in a space roughly 9 3/4 inches total height. Measured tens of microwaves in Walmart, combed through ridiculous amount of product pages on Amazon. Many have wrong info on product pages (height measured without feet or interior dimensions posted). This is one of the very few microwaves (or the only one) that actually has the housing at 9 1/2 inches. I tried at least one other that probably uses the exact same inside but has a slightly different housing that was also listed as 9.6 but was actually more like 10 1/4 inches.This microwave fits perfectly on the second shelf of IKEA RIMFORSA work bench / kitchen island and has a similar finish to that. And you'll have just enough room to add a non-slip rubber mat or velcro tape to feet to keep it from moving when opening the door.It's quiet and, most importantly, stops beeping right when you open the door. Things take longer to heat than with bigger microwaves but it would be the same with any small microwave like this. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase.",
