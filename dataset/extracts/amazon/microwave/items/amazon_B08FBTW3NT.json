It\u2019s nothing special, it is a bowl that you can microwave food in. Works great for what it is. I just have to say how it looks after i\u2019ve microwaved it and run it through the dishwasher hundreds of times makes it worth buying for anyone that uses their microwave regularly.",

                "reviewText": "It doesn't say verified purchase because my sister bought it for me three years ago. I was using cheap Rubbermaid bowl that I kept having to replace, and she bought me this bowl so I'd stop wasting the money. At first I was annoyed, but I quickly changed my mind. First, because I was able to cook Mac & Cheese in the microwave and it turn out good! But then because of how durable and cleanable it is. As I've said, I've had it over three years, but it still looks as good as the day I got it. I've used it for literally everything, like Mac & Cheese, ramen, spaghetti, ice cream, you name it. Not even the sauce from ravioli stained! Today, I made spaghetti and decided to take three photos. One with the spaghetti in the bowl, one after the spaghetti was gone showing how dirty it was, and one after I cleaned it. None of the spaghetti sauce stained! It's seriously amazing to me what this bowl has been through and still come out looking clean. lol Honestly never thought I'd ever be reviewing a bowl!",
