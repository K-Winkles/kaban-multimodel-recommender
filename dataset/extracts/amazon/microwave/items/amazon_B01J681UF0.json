It's now a weekend morning breakfast staple in our home, and I liked it so much that I ended up getting another one for our RV.The size of this omelet maker is perfect, and it's incredibly convenient. What I appreciate the most is how easy it is to clean \u2013 a real time-saver in our very busy household. The non-stick feature is fantastic; I can confidently say goodbye to sticky omelets. One of the coolest features is the ability to flip the omelet maker over, and the omelet effortlessly slides right out.",

This product takes the guesswork out of making omelets. It was extremely easy to use. It was plug-and-play right out of the box. The wells are deep so you can stuff your omelet full of all types of goodies. The one downside is that there are no temperature controls so you cannot control the temp between omelets.",

                "reviewText": "I really love my yellow colored omelet cooker. So incredibly easy to use. Holds just the right amount of egg For my breakfast. I do egg whites on one side, If husband does regular eggs on the other side. In about 6 minutes Or so, Depending on if we add things such as vegetables or meats to the egg mix, Eggs are cooked perfectly to our preference. The inside is not very non stick at all. I have found the more I used the egg Maker, It became less and less and less non stick surface. Now egg sticks to surface every single time. I have to put a little bit of water in each of the sides right after eggs are removed so stuck on food will be loosened when it's time to wash the egg Maker. Even though this is a negative to the product itself, I still find The Is omelet cooker very convenient. Not only have we used it for making our omelets, we have toasted sandwiches, Grilled cheese, pancakes and more.",

It's an amazing little appliance, very easy to use and wipes clean. I've used it twice to make ham, pepper, cheese omelets and they came out perfect both times. It's a little awkward getting the omelets out of the maker but I found that a wooded spatula works well.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Where have you been all my life?!",
                "reviewText": "Now that I have this in my life I simply won't be able to live without it. I love omelets. As somebody that has no culinary skills this is the answer to my prayers. It's so simple and makes great omelets. I'm on the keto diet so I use this at least twice a day. Just know that your omelets are going to be a bit different than what you get on a pan, the outside is going to be brown and the omelet is more \"cake-like\" than what you may be used to. Doesn't bother me, still tastes delicious! This is for quick and easy omelets that are tasty, if you want diner quality you should probably go to a diner or get your pan out.It only takes me about 5 minutes to cook my omelets. I see others say 8-10 minutes but all I know is that for my grill, it's perfectly done in about 5 minutes. But I do have my own strategy that I provide at the end of the review with tips.I want to add that I read a lot of reviews for this product since I wanted to be informed. Reading the negative reviews, it does seem that there may be some kind of inconsistency with the heating element for some people. I saw people complain about burnt eggs or it taking too long or a runny middle. I have none of those problems with my unit. If you are experiencing these problems you may want to return it or read my tips, they might help you.This is definitely something I would recommend to anybody that wants quick and easy eggs. However, if I could give it 4.5 stars instead of 5 I would, only because there is some room for improvement. For one, this thing gets real HOT. Do not touch the outside of this unit ever when it's on or you will get burned. Keep anything away from it while it is in operation. Also there is no power button or switch so you have to plug it in every time. I use an extension cord, just makes it easier for me to do this. Also there isn't a timer or anything, you just have to pay attention and figure out the timing on your own. Last, there does seem to be inconsistency for some people on how long it takes to cook the eggs, that makes it a bit harder to recommend to others not knowing what they might get.Now that said, let me get straight into the tips on how to make a good omelet with this maker!First- Use a jar to shake up the eggs and spices. Don't add your ingredients in the jar, just the eggs, it just makes the shaking take longer. It's a personal preference but why make more work than you have to by dirtying dishes? After you are done simply stick the jar in the fridge, or if you are done with the maker for a while, rinse it out and put it away.Second- Use 3 Eggs total for both sides AND use two tablespoons of water. Yes you read that right, WATER. Add the water to your jar when you are going to shake the eggs up. This is going to puff up your omelet real nice. Mix it all together in the jar.Third- With your grill already pre-heated, fill both sides of the grill with your mixed egg, BUT only about half way. Then add your ingredients directly into the eggs on the grill. Have your ingredients ready so you're not wasting time while the eggs are cooking. You don't want to overfill and this prevents that because you can stop adding ingredients if you are approaching the top of the fill line. If you have more room after adding ingredients, top off with the rest of the egg mix in your jar. Again, you can bring it right to the edge, just don't go over it. Close the lid.Fourth- Wait for the grill lid to start rising. If you did it right you should see the lid rise slightly. For me this takes about 3 minutes. Once the lid has risen on its own a fair bit, pull up the lid all the way and poke a hole directly in the middle of both omelets. They should both look pretty big at this point. Just a slight hole with something like a knife. This helps cook the middle a bit better and doesn't deflate the omelet. Place the lid back down.Fifth- At this point I usually just have to wait about 2-3 more minutes. I then remove the eggs with a rubber spatula and I get a perfect omelet every time!",

                "reviewText": "This works great, very easy to use and the end result was a beautiful fluffy omlet on the very first attempt.The only thing I had in the fridge to add was some shredded cheese, but that worked great with 4 eggs and a little salt and pepper. I probably put a little too much cheese in (\"too much\", is that even a thing?). I'm definitely going to try some of the other included recipes.A quick spray with some oil while it heated up and then once the green light came on I just poured the mixture in equally to both sides. Left it a couple of minutes then kept checking on it every 30 seconds and when the top looked cooked I took them out. The bottoms weren't anymore overdone, so I wouldn't bother with the flipping technique someone else mentioned (I was worried about how the top would cook, but it fluffed up to make contact with the top).Cleaning it was easy by wiping it down with a paper towel once it cooled down, and the cord wraps around the base for easy storage (it doesn't take up much space).The steel top is a bit of a fingerprint magnet, but meh - that's really \"first world problem\" nit-picking and nothing to worry about. So very happy with it, makes for a great breakfast.",
