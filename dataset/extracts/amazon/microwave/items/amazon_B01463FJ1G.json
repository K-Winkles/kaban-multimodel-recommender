The convection option is an added bonus. It has performed flawlessly for a month now and I look forward to using t for years. I was shopping at a local mall last weekend, stopped by Crate & Barrel and they had the same item for sale for $129.99. I had to smile at the fact I got it delivered to my door for much less, thanks Amazon.",

It has a lovely little ding when it\u2019s done and it evenly toasts, warms, and cooks to my heart\u2019s delight! When my last one of this model died it had lasted for 5 years. It just got old and blew an element! This one was also a much better price than before. Thank you CuisinArt for making this great product!",
