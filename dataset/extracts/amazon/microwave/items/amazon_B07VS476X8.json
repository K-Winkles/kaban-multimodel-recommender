It has a low power draw so i can run it off the generator without a problem and it does what a microwave is supposed to do. Seems to have good, consistent heating and isn't too loud- although i wouldn't call it ultra quiet compared to a regular size residential unit.",

GREAT for a small space. Nice Black finish. Digital controls. Seems well built. Turntable issues.INTENDED PURPOSE: Kitchen MicrowaveRECOMMENDATION: We bought this microwave on 01/25/2022 from Amazon. I thought we wrote a review at that time and had intended on updating now that its been in use for a couple of years but Amazon will only go back into 2023. So, here it is (updated)...The microwave is excellent for the small space we have. The buttons all work without having to apply a lot of pressure to the buttons. There is ONE complaint though... The plate that sits on the turntable is sooooooo easy to knock off. It doesn't sit on the rollers or center rotator very well. The stubs on the bottom of the plate are so short they have a hard time grabbing. Care must be exercised to keep it on. We've had plenty of other microwaves in the past. This one has to be the worst for keeping the table on track. Its not easy to get back on. There is a lot of fumbling in the process. It can be aggravating at times. But the overall performance of the microwave is that it still works and performs as its expected for a little microwave. It will take a little longer (seconds seem like hours) than larger units with higher wattage outputs. We would buy this unit again but we would first look to see if there is a different design or manufacturer that has a better turntable design. For the price point, this is a good buy and has served us well for 2 years now. We would still make a recommendation to buy. Just keep in mind the turntable issue.",

As an Engineering student, he sometimes has to study so hard that it's no time for the cafeteria, so we make sure to keep his mini fridge and cabinets stocked. This microwave was smaller than his previous one, but he's an R.A., and has a room all to himself. He loves that the interior is black as well. He loved the ease of the settings. Great for a single person or couple who have no children, a bachelor or bachelorette, or student. Well worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "700 watt, 0.7 cuft. Farberware microwave oven.This unit replaced an Insignia of the same size/dimensions. I could have replaced that unit with the exact same microwave oven (and $20 less expensive) but didn't because it only lasted 2 1/2 years when the power cord caught fire behind the metal back plate.So...... I decided on this Farberware unit thinking it would live up to it's reputation/name recognition. How wrong I was:1) After 4-5 uses, a few minutes each, the oven started making intermittent crunchy noises. Not inspiring confidence!2) Whoever designed this thing needs to go back to school: the interior is soooo tiny with \"nooks and crannies\", \"bumps and lumps\" everywhere that won't allow me to put anything but a coffee cup, a very small bowl or at most, a dinner plate in it.3) The touch pad feels very \"flat\" and is not very responsive. I have to put my fingers \"just so\" for it to respond. My prediction is that it won't take long before it quits altogether. Also not inspiring confidence!Remember my Insignia?.............it would fit my Tupperware Microwave Pressure Cooker. Not this one, it doesn't even fit through the door!!!!I never cook in my microwave but would like to be able to fit a halfway decent size bowl, casserole, or my pressure cooker in it!All this makes this oven completely useless in a average houshold, a household that doesn't demand that much of it's microwave. AND.....my $170.- TW Pressure Cooker is now obsolete.And, of course, return date elapsed TODAY.In short: very disappointed, never again!!!",
