I've only had this one for a couple of months but i'm pretty happy with it so far.This thing is cute, small footprint on the counter, lighter weight, has a vintage look (there are more vintagy looking ones out there, but they for some reason are not black, or have worse reviews), works fine, fits a plate, heats food.The way you set the time is weird at first, but becomes natural really quickly. Push the Instant Start, it puts on 1 minute and starts going, if you want more or less time, twist the big knob to increase or decrease time (clockwise =increase).. Piece of cake, becomes really intuitive. I really have not touched any other buttons on it bc this works fine for me.This is not constructed to live decades, nor should it for 80-some bucks, but it is cute and it is fine.",

                "reviewText": "We ordered a microwave and mini fridge from COSTWAY and stacked them in our basement. The microwave arrived about a week after ordering (April 2019). We like the appearance. The size is appropriate for our needs. I've used it a few times and it seems to work fine. My biggest complaint is the settings aren't intuitive. I had to read the instructions. This is a microwave that will rarely be used. Nobody wants to read the directions before heating up a cup of coffee. They just want to set the time and press start. Instead, this microwave has unnecessary options that make the display more crowded. Who is going to think, \"I'm heating 3.5oz. of fish, so I better use the Auto Cooking option A.8\"? I included a picture from the instructions to emphasize the point. Maybe a larger microwave used in a commercial kitchen might need these options, but not a microwave that's more appropriate for a dorm room. Nonetheless, it's a nice little microwave.",

I needed to move my micro out of the kitchen and it became visible from the living room, so I wanted one that would make a statement. It makes a GREAT statement! (See pictures) Set up was quick and easy and, yeah, the cord reaches the plug-in. My Fiesta-ware plate fits,too! I have used it to heat a cup of water and it did well. The only other need I have for it will be warming leftovers. I think it will work for that just as it did with the water .",
