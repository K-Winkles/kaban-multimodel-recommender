I tried the Hamilton Beach sandwich maker, and this not only makes a better sandwich, cleans up better, and is faster (I'm making sandwiches for myself and kids every morning). It's also a great value compared to the HB sandwich maker. The only downside I have found is that the eggs will sometimes pop, causing the maker to jump, in the microwave. This isn't a problem, just wanted to warn people so they aren't caught off guard.",

Other reviews said there were no instructions on them, received today in complete packaging with instructions, pic included for your enjoyment. I have found cooking time varies by microwave wattage and personal preference for done-ness. One egg, with a TBS milk and 1/4 tsp butter for 1 min 20 sec in 950 wt microwave is perfect for me!",

With a flexible rubber spatula, just scoop it right into/onto an English muffin, bagel, or in anything you want; the options are endless.

Theses make great at home \"Egg Mc Muffins.\" I give them to new parents - who need time savers while honing their parenting/couple skills. I also give them to bachelors and friends who are taking nutrition seriously. WARNING: Get TOASTING your muffins BEFORE you microwave FRESCH eggs (i.e. not a week old) !!! Because the eggs WILL be ready when the toast is done !!!. Then vary taste with different cheeses, seasonings or even jellies. Remember to spray with oil before cracking the egg. It will clean up easier AND the eggs will slide out. : ) I wanted THESE egg poachers because they are made with DURABLE hinges. Some microwave poachers hade plastic hinges will eventually wear out.
