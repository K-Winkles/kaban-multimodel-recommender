It's clear that this microwave is made to last.One of the things I love most about this microwave is how easy it is to use. The controls are intuitive and straightforward, and there are a variety of pre-programmed settings for different foods. I've also been impressed with how evenly the microwave cooks food. Everything from popcorn to pizza to frozen dinners comes out perfectly heated.Another great thing about this microwave is that it's surprisingly quiet. Even when running on full power, it's barely audible. This is a major plus for me, as I often use my microwave early in the morning or late at night without disturbing my family.Finally, I want to commend Midea for their excellent shipping service. I ordered my microwave on a Monday afternoon, and it arrived at my door on Wednesday morning. That's incredibly fast shipping, especially for a large appliance.Overall, I'm extremely happy with my new Midea microwave. It's a high-quality, feature-rich microwave that's also very easy to use. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new microwave.Pros:- Sleek and modern design- Sturdy build quality- Easy to use controls- Variety of pre-programmed settings- Cooks food evenly- Quiet operation- Fast shippingCons: None so far!",

                "reviewText": "This Midea 1.7 microwave does not have all the bells and whistles others have. The keypad has the basic presets, but does have the very important 30 sec. feature and the turntable off. The keypad numbers are easy to use due to the open layout and the absence of mega preset functions. Don't expect much light for the range-bulb puts out the equivalent (See Picture) of a night light. My units transformer for the magnetron hums so the unit is not super quiet. The Midea microwaves are all noted for excellent even heating. I have also installed the newer Midea 1.9 OTR model MMO19S3AST and for $60 more will run circles around this model and many of the other manufacturers higher priced models. So quiet, great LED stove light, better features, the only complaint is the the end of cycle BEEP is barely audible no matter what you set the loudness for. I know many people have never heard of Midea but it is the one of largest producers of OEM brand products in the world, so instead of the other brand names you have always loved, they are now marketing under their name. I will probably keep the 1.7 for a year and upgrade to the 1.9. They have the same mounting bracket and are interchangeable.",
