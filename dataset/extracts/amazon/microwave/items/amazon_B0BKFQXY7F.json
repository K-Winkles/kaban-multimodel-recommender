I have tried to cook chicken breast with it and it's fully cook in only 5 mins. It's a Japanese brand. The patent design with a tiny opening on 1 side allows the air to circulate just right. It's also very quick to cook vegetables (in about 3 mins). Save me tons of time and water to boil. For sure I'm going to take the set with me to my next RV trip.It also come with a recipe book, next time I will experiment with bread making",

Instructions don\u2019t include how to microwave just plain rice although it\u2019s tauted to be a rice cooker. The best calculation for cooking rice is one cup of rice - two cups water - at power 5 for 3 minute intervals or you will end up with rice water all over your microwave. My microwave is 750 watts. Always put product in pan in microwave. Otherwise you have a sticky mess. Better yet - don\u2019t buy until manufacturer cleans up instruction.",
