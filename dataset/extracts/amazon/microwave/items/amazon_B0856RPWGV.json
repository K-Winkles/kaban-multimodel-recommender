My only complaint is that it arrived dented on the corner backside, most likely from mishandling during shipping. The dent can be hidden if pushed back against the wall so I decided not to return it. It works great and is pretty easy to use. I appreciate that it's quiet. My last microwave was extremely loud. Note that the digital display light color is blue not green as shown in photos. I don't care for the blue but I realize most appliances are made like this now. Hoping for the best.",

                "reviewText": "Needed a typical countertop microwave, this one had some fabulous reviews & was inexpensive.Problem: Rust inside after several months (I'd noticed A LOT of moisture inside after using the microwave, I've never had that occur in any microwave) that encompassed the bottom front panel and the edges where the bottom meets the sides. Especially in the rear. We kept it very clean - upon the last wipe down (we tossed it at that time,) the rear panel bowed outward with a slight pressure of cleaning. In less than two years, this microwave was peppered with extensive interior rust and the rear wall was very flimsy. I've never encountered rust in a microwave.Another peeve: You cannot view the food through the window (important when making a roux!)",
