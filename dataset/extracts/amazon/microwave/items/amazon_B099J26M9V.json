It is not recommended to refrigerate.It is not recommended to stop and start the microwave oven during cooking. Once the microwave oven is stopped, the steam accumulated in the center of the corn kernel that will cause the popcorn to burst will cool down and will never reach the temperature required for re-popping. If you restart the microwave, you may also burn popcorn that has already popped. Using the sound test is the best way to determine if the popcorn is complete. If the time between ejection exceeds two seconds, it should stop.",

                "reviewText": "This was my third popcorn maker purchase and I admit I was skeptical about a microwave popper. I had previously purchased a hot air popper that wasn't working out for me because no matter what size container I used, the popcorn would fly out of the popper and all over the counter top. The unit prior to that required oil and used a metal arm to stir the kernels to keep them popping, but I really wanted an air popper.This microwave popper turned out to be the solution for me. I set it for 5 minutes and listen for when the popping slows down, and I end up with perfect popcorn every time with very few un-popped kernels. I can melt butter if wanted in the little silicone topper and the butter distributes evenly through the popped corn. It is dishwasher safe, but can easily be hand washed, too. (Note: the popcorn setting on my microwave resulted in scorched popcorn on my first try, and that is why I set it for a 4-5 timer and keep an eye on it).The popcorn tastes really good, too. I would not hesitate to recommend this style to anyone who is looking for a microwave popcorn maker.",
