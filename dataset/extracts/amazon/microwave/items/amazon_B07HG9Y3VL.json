The reheat plate setting is a great feature and it's also nice that it has a fast 1 through 6 minute one-button option. It's also quiet in operation.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the BLACK+DECKER Digital Microwave Oven and have been thoroughly impressed with its performance. The sleek stainless steel design fits perfectly in my kitchen, adding a modern touch. The 0.7 cu.ft capacity is ideal for my needs, and the turntable ensures even heating of my food.One of the standout features is the push-button door, which opens smoothly without any hassle. The child safety lock gives me peace of mind, especially with little ones around. With 700W power, this microwave heats food quickly and efficiently, saving me time on busy days.The digital controls are user-friendly and offer a range of settings that cater to different types of meals. Whether I'm reheating leftovers, defrosting frozen items, or cooking a quick snack, this microwave handles it all. It's also relatively quiet, which is a plus.One con is that the microwave is extremely lightweight, so it slides on the countertop, but that can be remedied with some 3M stickies.Overall, the BLACK+DECKER Microwave Oven is a reliable and stylish addition to my kitchen. Its combination of features, performance, and safety make it a great choice for anyone in need of a compact microwave that delivers on all fronts.",

                "reviewText": "Updated 20 Dec 2023:Well, here I am 90 days out from the purchase and about 6 weeks ago, it appears the venting fan no longer works, all steam remains and accumulates and since was not paying attention initially - accumulated significant'y under the rotating tray! (Wife asked,\"what's up with all this smoke/steam?!, water!).So, the 30 day window to return is gone - yet may yet \"Chat\" just to fully document to them.So, I try the Warranty service and wade through TWO seperate sights to then be told there's a \"special\" division that handles THESE units. Hmmm, okay... Instead of doing a \"warm handoff\" considering all the work I just did - I do, as they could, FORWARD the entire mail to the Email they provide.I then get back an email of \"questions\" (some bot response with an individuals name with a big thank you and let us know....!). So, ALL was in the email, but answer again and then take a photo of the serial number tag (no one told me where it was btw!!).I notice the email added \"numbers\", so \"support@.... turned into \"support+nnnnnnnnn@...\" and I had forgotten to attach the serial number phone pic so resend all and to specifically \"support@...\" AND the other too with the yet ANOTHER incident number.Next day (time difference with CHINA I am used to - my mornings are the best time to engage them it seems) - I get an email (yesterday) - \"we have one more question for you\" embedded in a link - RATE OUR SUPPORT SERVICE for this... \"like\", \"don't like\" or similar words. My response was - rater what? You have not done anything. So another day goes by and NO RESPONSE.So, I now have a Microwave just barely 90 days old, barely used since is 700 watts and used for only specific things, and? Wow - I can't afford to buy stuff like this here if there's NO WAY TO RETURN, REPLACE, REPAIR, REFUND IT!!. Wow.I said to them too - with how this is going - I look forward to reviewing how this goes - so, here this is to date.I will contact Amazon likely - since they may intercede, etc., or not, but letting them know directly and specifically and with ALL the messages in their system - they do review this stuff (I had one prior bad experience I got resolved by involving them directly within it all). So, can't fault Amazon in this, but if this is how this goes - and can't rely on what's sold here, then?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I purchase for the Brand since have had many items that just seem to do well for me.This is a disappointment functionally for two reasons -1) IT SLIDES all over the counter. Why would ANY OEM build something that will live on a formica counter top with SLICK, unstable supports? I just don't get it.2) Tiny thin, writing on Black, not back lighted - Labeling. Until this product I never needed to turn the big light on in the Kitchen AND put on my glasses. Now I do.The noise put me off a bit when first started up - startled me.All of my other Microwaves, ever, had a fan noise and more of a higher pitch, light hum to it. This one is to me, 3x's as loud, with a low, very textured buzz (not a hum a buzz, buzzing - heavy running sound).It's not the least expensive, not the most costly and since I find price is not always, or even usually an indicator of \"good/not-good\" - I went with brand and reviews.I did read the, or see the reviews that state the same as I say now - NOW I understand - but just didn't \"get it\" until today - wow - what to do.Otherwise, the controls are somewhat intuitive.The times to heat are about the same or the same as on my 1200 watt unit or the prior 900 watt unit. I felt that there was no need to use that much wattage to heat water, or warm food, etc.I was anticipating the inside dimensions being \"tight\", but remain functional for what I experience with other units. So, what I mean, as e.g., is like - I'd love to heat 3 slices of Pizza same time one place as with the room or power with the 1200 watt unit. However, I often wind up doing two or even one slice in order to over all just heat the slice versus getting very \"spotty\" hot/cold not evenly warmed. Slight overlaps of slices never works and actually have burned things when got jammed/not rotate. So, the smaller footprint would seems as a non-issue, or better this way. HOWEVER, as the Manual says, allow for THREE INCHES all around this unit when using, placing it. So, it may not \"functionally\" be a small a footprint as you imagine if don't have that for air/heat which you need to take *seriously!So, anyway, it's a microwave. The door looks safe, will remain safe I hope, not sag, loosen up, etc., \"leak\" as is the warning concerning the - Door. However again, the Non-back lit Control Labels, small font/type and thin/light/hard to see AND that now I have to figure a way to keep it from SLIDING ALL OVER my counter top - SO DANGEROUS even for \"Adults\" - WOW. I looked in the box for some anti-slide thing not installed - none. I mean - where - is a Microwave EVER INSTALLED that is on a NON-SMOOTH, easy to clean, sanitize surface - \"sliddy\"? Where - Black+Decker?In my opinion, that miss the mark for what I would otherwise, as first use rate would rate otherwise, 4 or even 5 stars. Then the Buzzing when running thing - is likely something that could be addressed. As with many things I see today now usually has to do with lowering the cost of manufacturing. I deal with mechanical audio and \"hear\" what they've done versus could do to quiet it down substantially.So, I hope that assists someone. Additionally, all in can say if Sliding is an issue, Small Control Labels, and Noise is an issue - take those Reviews to heart to consider - those are issues and wish I did. Yes, I could return it and may - we'll see. Who's to say what the others may be like - so... how much time to spend on this. Returns, especially with something this size are not easy for me to \"get to a shipper\" - so, consider all that is my advice and experience.",

Es mas ruidoso que mi horno viejo (el que iba a reemplazar por este) y el acabado metalico es de esos que dejan las huellas marcadas, se nota mucho y parece sucio todo el tiempo.Si calienta bien y los tiempos son correctos . Tiene botonos de encendido rapido de 1 a 6 minutos y memorias para tiempo y potencia de cocci\u00f3n, pero es impractico si quieres poner un tiempo de calentado especifico, hay que oprimir otro boton previo para programarlo ya que no se puede hacer directo con los numeros como la mayoria. Me decepciono el timer, no se puede programar con nada, es decir solo existe pero no se usa para encender o las memorias, es algo inutil asi.Tiene el boton de agregar tiempo de 30 seg pero no tiene para disminuir.Lo devolvi por el tama\u00f1o mas angosto y lo ruidoso no me resultaba funcional asi",
