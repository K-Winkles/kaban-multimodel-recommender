The size is good, it can hold a dinner plate easy enough. The best feature is being able to turn the sound off. I also like the handle, rather than a push button opening. I wish it had the 10 second button like the other had but it does have the 30 second one. Haven't read all the directions close yet, so can't turn it on for a minute and a half, because soon as you push the 1 button it starts. The white interior is very easy to see any mess and very easy to clean. Glad I found this one. It was a lot of looking, for the price range, size and features.",
