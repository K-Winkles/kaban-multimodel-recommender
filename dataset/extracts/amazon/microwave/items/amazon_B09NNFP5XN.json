Put one or two cups of rice in the plastic pot. Add one or two cups of water or measure it with your finger like your mother taught you. Microwave on high for 10 or 15 minutes, (depending on your microwave's power) Any left-overs? Wash the inner lid, put on the top snap on lid and refrigerate. To reheat, put one or two ice cubes on top of the rice, (don't laugh) microwave on high, 1 or 2 minutes, open the cooker, discard the ice cubes, Bon Appitite!",
