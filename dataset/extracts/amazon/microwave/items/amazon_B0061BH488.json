                "reviewText": "Just a few days old, so read accordingly. We have baked using the convection feature, and while the baking was slower than I expected, everything came out fine. I assume that the power use is significantly lower than heating up the full size oven. As a microwave, this thing is a breeze, with a nice one-touch 30 second feature that you can press as often as you like, and other one touch features. The display is easy to read and clear. The quality seems like that of a commercial unit; heavy construction, stainless inside and out, solidly built. However, this doesn't eat up a lot of counter space. The noise level is very comfortable, other than the 5 beeps when something is finished. I'm still reading to see if that feature can be disarmed. At $200, this unit wasn't cheap, but with a 3 year warranty and the apparent quality of Cuisinart, I anticipate the purchase being worth the little bit extra over other brands. Looks cool too, and easy to see through the glass when cooking! Word of warning, Beach Camera here on Amazon sells these \"refurbished\", for $149. They claim the units are are like new. I got two in a row from them severely damaged and dented, and on the first, the carousel wouldn't spin. They claimed shipping problems, but neither shipping carton was at all damaged. Word to the wise: Avoid the headache, and if you can spend the little extra, get a new one and get the warranty.",

I am not sure if it's just my product or this is true in general but it will make this very loud rattling noise when you try to start heating anything! it will continue to be very loud for the first 30seconds or so. Very loud motor sound when you are in the kitchen is so annoying! I am especially sensitive to loud vibration noise so this was horrible for me. I was able to return it since i only purchased it 2 weeks ago but this thing is very heavy, hence such a hassle to return. I now have to shop for a different microwave- what a pain. Perhaps conventional \"simple\" microwave ovens will be better.",

                "reviewText": "item arrived a day early, in great condition. . .actually looks new...VERY minor scratches on the top corner of this refurbished product. I tested everthing to be sure it works. Every function works perfectly, so far. Serveral reviews noted they thought the convection oven heated slowly. I don't find this to be the case at all...considering these are 110V I think it's pretty quick.. got up to 350 degrees in about 12 min. The buttons are pretty small,..somewhat difficult for an old guy like me to read. . .but not too bad, they are white letters/numbers on a black background. It's very attractive inside and out, Easy to use with the buttons well laid out. I especially like the 30 sec button that you can push repeatedly for 30 sec, 60 sec, 90 sec, etc, , then it starts the micowave immediately. The only reason I didn't give this refurbished unit 5 stars is the door latch. It's really awful . .as noted by many reviews of those who purchased the new one, not even refurbished. It closes very easily, but pushing the button doen't always open without having to pull under the door frame at the same time. This is VERY Annoying! I have a Panasonic commercial microwave wth a simple handle. . .it works so much better than the push button door. I don't understand why most microwave have a push button door when a handle works so mch better. I'll write another review if something goes wrong in the near futher, but so far I'm pleased with this Cuisinart Convection Microwave.",
