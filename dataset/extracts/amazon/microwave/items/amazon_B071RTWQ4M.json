Moved it to a wall outlet and it works great. Sharp has excellent customer service and was about to replace it but they did not have to. No scratches, arrived early and boxed well. Was glad that Sharp still stands behind the products they sell and they last a long time. My last Sharp mircowave lasted twenty one years but they have gotten smaller in size..",
