It actually has 10 different continuous power levels and not the old world pulsating, on-off-on-off-on-off to get lower power. The difference is amazing cooking and defrosting results. Warm up your coffee and cream without curdling the cream. Also, perfect frozen meals, pizza, popcorn and perfect fast defrosting. It has the highest internet rating but don't buy this if you know you won't read the owner's manual and learn a few new tricks. Instead, buy a $79.00 cheap-o.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars A high-quality microwave oven\u2026except for the human-machine interface",
                "reviewText": "The Panasonic NN-SN75LW 1.6 cu.ft Cyclonic Inverter Countertop Microwave Oven is touted by many as a high-quality pick amongst moderately-priced microwave ovens, and in our approximately one month of experience with it, one can see that the reputation is rightfully earned. It\u2019s powerful, compact enough for countertop placement, and full of features\u2014some expected, others less so, and some, at least for us, simply extraneous.In order to bundle all those features in one machine and a small surface area for the touchpad controls, the designers and engineers had to get a little creative. Which in turn leads to an interface that isn\u2019t always as intuitive as one might expect or wish for. (Disclosure\u2014I come from the school that believes that all microwave ovens should be of the sort that one can walk up to any microwave, anywhere, and pretty much instantly be able to do the basics\u2014warm up coffee, heat up leftovers, \u201cbake\u201d a potato, boil water, etc.)This isn\u2019t a microwave one can simply walk up to, look at the control pad for a moment, and proceed without further ado. Some things will work just fine that way. Others will not. And there\u2019s at least one potential trap that could yield a rather bad outcome if one falls into it.Examples:1. The Coffee/Milk button. Pressing this button once, one sees a message on the display: \u201c1-1\u201d, with a 1 or I in a square diamond, flashing. [I now take this to mean there\u2019s more information to be gleaned about what one is seeing\u2014that information in the Instruction Manual. I hope you didn\u2019t throw it out.] It\u2019s not clear what \u201c1-1\u201d means. Press the button again, and it changes the message to \u201c1-2\u201d. Press a third time, \u201c2-1\u201d, and a fourth, \u201c2-2\u201d. Pressing again begins a recycling of these choices. Whatever they mean. [Yes, it\u2019s explained in the manual. Relatively simple, but still, certainly not fully intuitive.]2. The Power Level button. This one reads \u201cPower Level (11 levels)\u201d. Which made me wonder if this was designed by the same engineers that produced the amps for Spinal Tap. If you press it once, you get Level 10. Press it again, Level 9, and so on, down to Level 0. Which isn\u2019t for zero output, of course, but instead is intended to keep warm food warm whilst waiting for something to happen, someone to arrive, etc. This is odd, but acceptable. However, there\u2019s another quirk to be recognized here. And this one is potentially dangerous. When I saw the Power Level button, I figured one could follow my usual modus operandi for power levels on microwaves: press in the time, select the power level, and press Start. So, I give it a try. I decide to cook popcorn for two minutes at level 9. Press in the time, press Power Level, change to 9, press Start. Nothing. Huh. So, I guess I need to put in the time after the Power Level\u2014I press 2, 0, 0 for the time, then start, and ta-da!\u2014it\u2019s off and running. At the end of two minutes, the popcorn is popping very, very slowly, indicating it\u2019s about done. And the microwave beeps, indicating it\u2019s done, and..then it starts in one the SECOND phase of cooking. Thankfully, I realize what is happening before the popcorn is on fire, and I stop everything, remove the popcorn, sort the slightly charred bits out, and move along. But that necessitated a visit with the manual, wherein I learned that on entering the time first, I was also telling the oven\u2019s brain that the power level for that two minutes was the default\u2014level 10. The two minutes I pressed in after selecting level 9 told the teeny little brain\u2014AI this is not\u2014that the second cook time was to be two minutes at level 9. Had I not been paying attention, I could\u2019ve set the kitchen on fire. Granted, we\u2019ve been talking about a kitchen re-do, but a torch-the-room demo isn\u2019t a good method by which to start.3. Sensor Cook (Reheat). The oven has a \u201cGenius\u201d moniker added on the front, and it applies to the automatic sensor cooking. Which, really, isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be. It really does require reading the manual, and, well, one hopefully gets the idea.I\u2019ve learned the basics necessary to achieve what I desire from the oven, though, and it does a good job at doing the one job I ask of it\u2014applying some microwave energy at some chosen level for a given period of time. It also does some other stuff. We\u2019ll seldom if ever use most of those things, and almost certainly won\u2019t get much use out of the Genius Sensor Cook feature. But it looks to be dependable, powerful, and it\u2019s thus far been easy to clean, too.Four stars, with Five-Star Performance Rating reserved for those microwave ovens that are a little less likely to be able to produce a kitchen fire while still being adequately intuitive in their use.",

                "reviewText": "This is a good, spacious microwave that should serve most people's needs. It's squatter than I originally expected it to be and the turntable is higher up, but the tallest thing I put in there is a bottle of microwave syrup. That said, don't expect it to be like those microwaves from the 1980s that were so big you could fit a whole turkey inside.At 1250W, this is the most powerful consumer microwave I am aware of, and by turbo defrost, it really does mean TURBO defrost. If you're in a hurry, this can defrost two pounds of meat in less than 10 minutes. That said, don't ignore the beep it makes partway through defrosting large amounts of meat like that unless you want hot outer edges and a still-frozen middle\u2014this is the first microwave I've ever used that does that for the defrost cycle, and that happened to me when I was defrosting a package of chicken drumsticks. This is an inverter microwave, and therefore you will not hear the magnetron click on and off like you do with non-inverter microwaves. I'm still getting used to that.Like other reviewers have found, the buttons do take effort to push, and in particular I sometimes can't get the 1 button to register unless I press a function button first.This microwave does take up a big footprint, and if you're looking to put it on a microwave cart, you will have to shop around for one it'll fit on. I do have a review up for what I use if any future buyers are looking for a (relatively) inexpensive option for that.Overall, a good microwave from a quality brand that I can recommend for people who have or can make the space.",
