A good quality appliance surge protector is a must-have item in all homes, but most people don\u2019t realize its importance until something blows up. If the appliance was turned on and receives the impact, it simply burns. And that is the least serious. A fire may be the other option. A power surge can create an arc of electrical current within an appliance. The heat generated during this process can permanently damage circuit boards and other components. If one surge doesn't ruin your possessions, multiple smaller surges may. Continued power surges can erode internal parts and shorten the useful life of an appliance. IF YOUR MICROWAVE OVEN SUFFERS YOUR WALLET TOO! Surges and spikes can damage home equipment beyond practical repair, either instantaneously or over time. Even a little voltage change can eventually destroy or affect the performance of your microwave oven.",

                "reviewText": "Received this afternoon to use on a new microwave oven. Due to power fail/restore and brown-outs, my old microwave oven only gave the faintest audible alerts when heating was complete. All other functions were good but I\u2019d like to have an audible alert when cooking was complete. I have, for years, a surge protector/line conditioner that constantly displays the ac voltage from the power company I use for my audio/video equipment. Watching the voltage when power restores after failing or when there\u2019s a brown-out is an eye opener. The voltage can drop to near 100 and rise to 130. At one particular time the power company had severe problems. The voltage fluctuated from below 80v to over 150v. Many people lost fridges, air conditioners, tv\u2019s, etc. After reading that this unit actually doesn\u2019t send power to the microwave for about 30 seconds after commercial power restores, I had to buy it. I have simulated a power failure to see if it really works. It did! About 30 seconds after power restored to the outlet the microwave powered on.Considering how this protector operates, I think it\u2019s a good value.Note: When commercial power restores the voltage usually takes several seconds to settle down. This can be the hardest on equipment.Also note, regarding other comments regarding the instructions, the single page with the device is equal in both English and Spanish. They both say the same thing. This device is about the simplest thing to use. Per the label on the device itself, plug the equipment into it (the microwave) THEN plug this protector into the ac outlet. The led\u2019s on the front tell you the status. You should see a yellow light indicating Delay Period. After about 30 seconds the unit will click and the green Normal Voltage led will light. Thats when the microwave will power up.",
