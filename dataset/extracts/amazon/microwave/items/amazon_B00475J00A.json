                "reviewText": "This is great ... just hours after delivery, I drove to the store to get a few onions and tried it out with a very simple recipe.I sliced part of the top and part of the bottom off.I peeled the thin, dark layers off.I gouged a bit of a hole in the top (and ate the onion I gouged out).I firmly put onion in cooker, being sure to push onion down over protruding \"piercer\"I put some fake butter in the hole I gouged (and above it)Since I have a small microwave, fewer watts, I nuked it for six minutes instead of the recommended 4-5 minutes. The second day, I did it for seven minutes and it was also delicious.I let it sit for much longer than the recommended 2 minutes after it was done cooking.(It was still very hot when I got it out of microwave, five minutes after cooking, so have pads ready)It was delicious.I'm going to experiment with longer times, and experiment with putting seasonings on it before cooking. I wonder what seasonings would make it taste like a blooming onion without having to deep fry it?I highly recommend this product. (But watch out for burnt fingers. It is hot after it cooks, so let it sit awhile.",

Just peel the onion skin, rinse, and place in the cooker and then into the microwave. It basically steams the onion. Depending upon the size of the onion and how soft I want it, 3 to 4 minutes seems to work for me. It is also great for cooking a handful of frozen veg as a quick side item.Caution, the contents will be hot and may produce hot liquid. Be careful opening the cooker and draining any fluid.The cooker is easy to clean with soap and water or top shelf dishwasher. I bought several of these cookers for friends and family.",
