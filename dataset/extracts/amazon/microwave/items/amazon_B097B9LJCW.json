Second one came and it worked fine for a few days. Then it started shutting off in the middle of a cooking cycle. Happened when using the Instant Start button and the regular timed cook setting. The clock then goes haywire showing weird numbers and symbols. See video.Imagine putting in a bag of popcorn and having to restart the microwave multiple times during a 2 minute cook time. Every bag of popcorn was burnt, yet half the kernels still didn\u2019t pop. Also I sometimes warm up liquids in a disposable Dixie coffee cup to drink on my way to work. Microwave would burn the glue holding the cup seams together. The seams would be burnt black, releasing that glue into my drink and making my house smell like a chemical factory. That\u2019s never happened before, even with more powerful microwaves.Microwave is super attractive and looks sophisticated in the kitchen. But believe the reviews, it\u2019s a terrible machine.",

Some dinner plates have to be tilted in order to fit on the turn tables in through the door. Popcorn must be watched carefully, as the bag gets stuck, you can burn your popcorn, we really can\u2019t get all the Colonels popped evenly in this microwave, even when the bag spins the whole time. It takes 24 minutes to reheat, cold coffee, and this is just because the power level is lower in the smaller compact microwave. We are not unhappy with the performance, as it is small, and we didn\u2019t have room for a larger more powerful one.",

The only downside is that the magnetron is a bit louder than other microwaves I've had (even cheap ones). This isn't a huge problem since I don't microwave often enough for it to be irritating, but I thought I'm mention it anyway.One random problem I personally experienced when first the unit was that defrost mode repeatedly tripped my circuit breaker. Odd, because continuous full power did not. I determined it was just the breaker going out, and I have had no additional issues to date.",

We needed a small one but I hate appliances on the counter because they are chunky and usually ugly. This is elegant and cool but it doesn't work very well and we've only had it a week. The sound it makes when warming food is louder than I anticipated and has weird rattling noises. Not worth the cost it feels sturdy but I'm not sure it's built to last long. Built for looks \ud83d\ude1c which I do love \ud83e\udd29.",
