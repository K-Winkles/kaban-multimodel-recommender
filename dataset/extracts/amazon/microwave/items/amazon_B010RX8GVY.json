                "reviewText": "After many years of service, my GE SpaceMaker II microwave needed to be replaced. Unfortunately, the line has been discontinued by GE. They offer one model that's close to the dimensions, but the size would not work well for the space I have (built-in shelf). While there are lots of compact microwaves, the issue is the depth -- most are too deep to fit on a wall shelf.This has the proper depth for sitting on a shelf without issue provided that you use a flat pig-tail adapter so that the plug doesn't jut out and prevent the microwave from sitting close to the wall. The width is less than the nearly 24 inches of the SpaceMaker, but I filled the empty shelf space with a storage cannister that I found that matches the microwave.The microwave itself is a basic model that has few bells and whistles. I only use the microwave to reheat leftovers, and this does a fine job of that. Heating is even, and the 700W, while low powered compared with larger microwaves, gets the job done just fine. The controls are easy to use and are very similar to the SpaceMaker controls, which was a plus for me. The fit and finish are much better than other compact microwaves I looked at. It will fit a full-size dinner plate without issue.It's not a perfect replacement for the SpaceMaker, but it's a workable one. It provides good functionality as a basic compact microwave, looks much nicer than you would expect for the price point, and is easy to use. A very good value for the price, especially if you can catch it on a price dip. Five stars.",

                "reviewText": "Keep in mind this is a low wattage microwave (it takes forever to hear something) but that\u2019s the trade off for the compact size. If you want a more powerful microwave- get a bigger one . Love the fact that you can turn off the sound. Good value for the money. One minor issue (the buttons are not particularly responsive - you kind of have to put some pressure on them)",

                "reviewText": "My old microwave, manufactured in 2002, finally died. It was a tabletop, but I had built it into the cabinets to save counter space. It was less than 12\u201d in height, so I needed another skinny one, or I had to rebuild my cabinets. It took forever to find one that one fit, but the fact that this is a GE, helped make the purchase. It is not as powerful as my old one, but it does a good job and looks good. A good value, even though Amazon raised it\u2019s price by $20 bucks.",
