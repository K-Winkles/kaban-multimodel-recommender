                "reviewText": "This is a great microwave. The best part is it is an inverter microwave. Point of fact most microwaves are not inverter and no matter the power level you set, they blast full power. The non-inverter microwaves just reduce how often they blast full power. This is why the non-inverter microwaves cause popping and splattering no matter what you set them on. The inverter microwaves, however, actually reduce the power and keep it on steady at that level. So a much, much better way to go. I like most of the features on this microwave except the sensor ones. Never had much luck with sensor settings so I don't use them. If I had one minor complaint, I wish it was easier to set the power levels and change them during the cooking process since that is my main reason for ordering an inverter microwave.",
