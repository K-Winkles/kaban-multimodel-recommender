                "reviewText": "I love this microwave one because it fits in our built in space. We also ordered the trim kit (not on Amazon as it wasn\u2019t available at the time). I love that it has a 10 second feature in addition to 30 seconds because many times I just need 10, love the modern lighting and seems to have everything I need. 2 cons\u2026.1. It\u2019s a little noisy but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m just getting used to a new microwave. 2. It doesn\u2019t fit flush against the trim kit, it sits back (inset a bit like almost an inch. Now maybe the trim kit is off or our space is off or maybe the wrong base was in the trim kit. This is the most annoying thing, but again it could just be our situation. However despite these small minor issues, it\u2019s a win! It\u2019s almost impossible to find one that fits our built in space as the dimensions and design of microwaves has changed. We have modified our space once to accommodate this, but happily we do not have to modify a second time due to this microwave fitting. I should also mention it just really looks modern and seems very high quality. So far heating seems to be good and it\u2019s easy to use. If you are having trouble fitting your built in space, give this one a try. There were only a couple we could even choose from and so happy we chose this.",

I really don\u2019t use it to do much more than popcorn and reheating. Popcorn has 3 different presets for the popular different size bags. I buy the larger bags. However if I use that preset it burns the popcorn. So I started using the preset for the next size down bag. It STILL burns the popcorn! I could have saved myself a LOT of money and purchased a less expensive microwave that would have popped popcorn correctly!",
