So it was time to buy a new microwave.I also purchased a microwave plate cover to protect this new microwave from splatter. The splatter is what caused my old microwave's paint to chip away. If you have food splatter (like pasta sauce) inside the microwave, then you turn the microwave on. You'll cook the paint job. Over time the paint will start to chip away.So i bought this plate cover and so far it's keeping the microwave clean:(i included a photo of the plate cover inside the microwave)https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KVK337M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Pros:- Cooking -It cooks really well. I was surprised to find out this cooks a bit better than my old microwave. Seems to cook more evenly. Cooks just as fast as my old microwave (similar wattage)My old microwave: 1,000 wattsThis Toshiba: 1,100 watts- Touch pad (East To Use) -Nice simple touch pad. It works well. Lots of quick touch options. The \"One touch start\" is great, press 1 for 1 minute, 2 for 2 minutes, etc... good for older people. Not complicated to figure out.- Instruction Label -It has a label on the inside the microwave with info / instructions for cooking different things (defrost, melt, popcorn, etc) so you have that info available to you anytime.- Noise Level (Cooking noise) -It does make noise like all microwaves do but the noise it makes is actually pretty quiet. Much more quiet than my old microwave.The noise it makes is an odd buzzing noise when you turn it on to cook. At first i thought that buzzing noise it was making was a bad sign but that's just the noise it makes. Not an issue. Just a new sound to a different microwave.- Keypad Beep noise -You can turn off the beep noise of the keypad. I turned it off to test it, it works. But i turned it back on just because i then realized i enjoy hearing the beep noise feedback.- Child safety -There is a safety option, at first i thought if i activate it, it would prevent the door from opening but that's not how it works. If you activate it, you can still open the door. But the microwave won't function until you turn off the lock via the keypad. A little lock icon will appear on the LCD screen to let you know it's locked.So after every time you finish using the microwave you will have to turn the lock option on. When you want to use it, turn lock option off. If you have kids it might be worth the extra steps to lock / unlock it, otherwise it's not worth using.- Microwave color -It looks stylish. Especially if you have black / chrome around the kitchen. It's also fine with white also.Cons:- The stainless steel on the door is a \"finger print magnet\". If you touch it, it will create smear marks. The handle has the chrome also.(i included a photo of that)- Color options -One thing i noticed when trying to buy a microwave. The color options are very limited.I do wish this microwave had more color options. I originally was hoping to get a 100% white microwave or at least get this same color microwave but have the black be in the color of white or even 100% silver but it's not an option. It's fine though. It still looks pretty good.- Clock -Not really a huge complaint, but if you unplug the microwave, the clock gets reset automatically. I think this is an issue with all microwaves. Would be nice if it could save the time when not plugged in. Because if you accidentally unplug it, then you have to set the time again.Summary:I haven't fully tested ALL the cooking features. But for basic everyday use of quickly heating / cooking things, it works well, cooks well. Great microwave. Worth spending money on as it's an investment that should last for many years.",

                "reviewText": "Allow me to paint you a story of our time before this microwave.My husband and I have gone through exactly 2 microwaves in our 11 year relationship before landing on this one. Our first was a tiny thing made in 2004 that could barely manage cup o' noodle. It finally died sounding like the cries of a thousand whales back in late 2017. It had a good long life of burnt popcorn and cold reheated food.We went without a microwave because we were dirt broke at the time from finally becoming homeowners (oof our savings), and then my in-laws graced us with their microwave that *they* had gotten as a wedding gift in Canada in.. 1988. I used to say that the microwave was almost as old as I was until we found the manufacturing date was April 1988. Dang, the microwave was now officially one month older than me. Still had to deal with uneven cooking, burnt popcorn or half popped bags, and a defrost function that only seemed to work half the time and literally cook the food the other half. This beast of a microwave is an enigma in the fact that it has somehow survived all these years without even needing anything replaced. Honestly the microwave still \"works\". I can relate heavily to this microwave.After the last few years of me completely swearing off of trying to make microwave popcorn, my husband complaining about even more burnt popcorn and unpopped kernels at the same time, I finally asked if we could manage to scrape some money together to get an actual working microwave. After much debating, I was tasked with researching a good microwave that was big enough and mostly inexpensive enough. I had heard a bit about this microwave and a few others and ultimately decided on this one. The price was right, the size was perfect, the functionality was great, being able to turn off literally all the beeping was fantastic. Unfortunately the first one we got was mostly DOA and it was really disappointing, especially since I had to move a microwave that I'm sure weighed about 50lbs, I wish I was joking. Amazon took care of the return and replacement real easy and quick, and the new-new microwave came today.The first test was popcorn. Oh boy. Since everyone says \"don't use the popcorn button\", I definitely didn't. Unfortunately the microwave did burn the bag of popcorn at full power. So, I decided to actually use the popcorn button. I hit the popcorn button twice (setting for a 3oz bag) just to make sure it would have enough time to heat up and pop. Oh boy. I was not prepared for what happened. The popcorn actually popped! And it only took maybe a minute and a half! No burnt popcorn *and* most of the kernels were popped. Our toddler rejoiced that mommy had actually popped a bag of popcorn, \"Yay! You did it mommy!\"Second, I defrosted a 1lb package of frozen ground beef. Woo, that was a breeze. Set the defrost for the weight and let it go, though it did warm the edges a bit too much but it was quick and didn't cook it like our last microwaves.Third and most terrifying. Before this microwave, I had gotten used to putting a mug of coffee/tea/water/whatever to heat/reheat for a minute or more and it not even being hot-hot. I stuck a mug of water (with a few tapioca pearls in it) in the microwave to test and set it for one minute, after a short time I glanced into the microwave and discovered it was actually boiling. A very loud proclamation of \"Oh my god!\" rang from myself in the kitchen. I promptly called my husband over to also observe what the mug of water was doing. He also loudly proclaimed \"Oh my god!\"In short: I can't believe what I used to consider \"normal\" for a microwave. This one is more than leaps and bounds better than what we \"had to just deal with\" in a time of penny pinching and saving money. We're finally mostly comfortable and were in desperate need of a good quality microwave.In very short: I love this microwave.",

                "reviewText": "I was going through my past orders and didn't realize I hadn't reviewed this yet, which is crazy because I feel like evangelizing about it, I love it that much.I've had this oven for 3 years now, and I couldn't possibly be happier with it. It functions well, it's really easy to use and clean, and best of all NO BEEPING. The silent operation of this oven is its best feature and the primary reason I ordered it. I know most people are probably happy to operate it with the beeping sounds, but if having the option to silence all beeping sounds is as essential to you as it was to me then this is your oven.Once in awhile when the power goes out I'll have to reset the silent mode when I reset the clock, but other than that I never hear any beeping from it whatsoever. Not when the buttons are pressed, not when the cooking cycle is done.I've seen some reviews saying it's loud when cooking, but it's no louder than any other microwave - I don't know what these people are talking about. All microwaves make some noise when cooking.",

                "reviewText": "Have had this microwave for about a month now, bought it to replace my 20-year old Panasonic that had suddenly started taking much longer to heat. Chose this because it also has the convection/air fryer function. The 'regular' oven function works great - heats fast (minutes) and cooks well (chicken wings, roasted garlic) - very useful alternative to using a full oven. The microwave timer is set with a dial, and changes time increments as you pass 60 seconds, 5 min, etc. This is a bit annoying, but only because I am used to entering an exact number on the keypad of my last oven. Still getting used to the individual features and \"quirks' of this oven, so I keep the manual close by. Clock very easy to set. Stainless steel interior is easy to clean, but recommend always covering the top of 'messy' food as the ceiling of the oven has an element, making it harder to access for cleaning.",

                "reviewText": "I previously purchased the larger 1.6c Toshiba microwave, but it was HUGE, and very cumbersome to move and fit anywhere, despite taking careful measurements before purchasing, but even worse, you could not see the keypad at all because it was black with gray numbers, needless to say, it was returned and this microwave was purchased to replace it. I can't express how much easier it is to see the keypad for this microwave oven. This oven fits better, it doesnt have that huge \"bulge\" in the back of it that they never include in the measurement specs, and it us super quiet, you can barely hear it operating. It also has twice the presets that the larger more expensive oven had.It cooks really well, and is noticeably more powerful than our old 1000w microwave.I cant find anything to complain about with this oven, so I will recommend it.",
