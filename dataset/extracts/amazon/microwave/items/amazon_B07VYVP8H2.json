                "reviewText": "A nice little microwave but be careful to allow the recommended clearance and/or add a little fan to move the air better. Our 0ld RV had a decent space for the ancient unit that came with it but not for newer microwaves with higher power. I added a small fan to solve the problem.",

                "reviewText": "Works great, has every feature I could want and more. Bought this to replace a 900 watt Oster mwave that finally gave out after many years. I liked the old one (size, etc.) but this one has some bells and whistles that I really like. One notable plus is that I can see the food cooking much clearer than I can recall ever seeing with any microwave in past.I initially bought a 1000 watt \"Magic Chef\" and returned it to Walmart after only 1 day. Ordered this Kenmore on Amazon and really glad I did. Arrived 5 days earlier than quoted/estimated.",

                "reviewText": "I had the predecessor to this microwave that unfortunately lasted me around 6 years which honestly isn't a long time for microwave.But I digress.So I wanted to buy a similar one in the same color as before which was white and matched with everything else in the kitchen.Ok, Kenmore doesn't make a white one.Received this new one today and two things that kind of bother me...the clock turns off after 30 seconds to a minute which is fine I guess since my oven has a clock on it that shows 24/7. That means that a clock isn't really useful or needed so not sure why they include it.The other issue that bothers me is that the light inside the microwave doesn't turn on when you open it. The light only works when you are warming up food which is fine but the moment you open it the light is not on.I know most of us don't just sit in the kitchen in the dark warming up our food but what if I did? Now that's taken away from me.If those are power saving options then honestly that's not needed on a microwave! That appliance is using enough power temporarily that leaving an LED light all the time wouldn't match it and neither would a light when you open the microwave!WTF Kenmore?!I'm honestly going to test this out for a couple of weeks and while I already threw away the box, I can easily buy a new one big enough to send this thing back and get another brand.",

                "reviewText": "The only thing a don't like about this Kenmore microwave is there isn't enough support at the front. The door goes all the way to the bottom of the appliance; therefore, when you open the door, the whole microwave dips down. The front supports on the bottom could have been moved a little more forward to help stabilize the microwave.",
