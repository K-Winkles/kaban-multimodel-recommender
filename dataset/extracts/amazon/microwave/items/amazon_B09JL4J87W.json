After just placing it on top, it worked okay and the popcorn popped enough to push it up anyway. Did watch the popcorn carefully after 2 minutes and it took maybe 15 seconds extra. Love the way it collapses to store. The bowl is too flimsy to eat out of but that was okay with us.",

                "reviewText": "I literally use this popper every single day. I buy the mushroom popcorn kernels and they are so tender and perfect. The lid lifts off with the larger popcorn. At the 30 second remainder point I take off the top and toss on a couple cubes of butter to melt during the final cook time. As others have said, the bowl gets very hot. I just grab with a dish towel. There are also some unpopped kernels but that is better than overcooking and burning.I used smaller \"ladyfinger\" kernels and those did slip through the holes on the measuring cup cap. They are also a little dense - smaller kernels = more kernels and less volume when popping. I would not recommend using that variety for this cooking method.",

My girlfriend and I were watching from across the kitchen honestly not knowing if the entire microwave (It's a new) was going to blow up. I heroically crossed the kitchen and opened the microwave oven and removed the brand new Christmas gift to find that there was now a pencil sized hole on the inside of the oven. A hole which was caused by such extreme heat that both plastic AND metal were burned straight through. The popcorn looked great though!",
