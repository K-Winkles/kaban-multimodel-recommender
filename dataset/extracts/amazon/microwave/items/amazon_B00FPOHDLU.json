                "reviewText": "I really wanted to get a cute microwave when we decided to replace my crappy old small white one. There are those retro style ones, but they got a lot of awful reviews. This one is very attractive, for a microwave, and it works great. It's a pretty big size, it fits on top of the 3/4 size fridge in my studio apartment just fine. It seems quite strong, I can heat up a bowl of Progresso kind of soup to piping hot in about 3 mins. My old crappy low wattage microwave took like 5-6 minutes. I got one of those plastic covers that you put on the food to keep it from splattering for the new microwave, and I'm sure that helps speed up the cooking time too, but it's definitely a decent wattage, big enough for a large dinner plate, and as far as I can tell everything works really well! I'm very pleased with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Very decent microwave and I feel like it was priced competitively enough to wait an extra few days for Shipping to Canada. Unfortunately the microwave was delivered 2 days earlier by Canada Post and had to pick it up from the Post Office. I wish I had put my tracking information in the app right away because Amazon has a problem with under promising and over delivering (pun intended). After about 10 breaks my 5'10 self was able to finally get the microwave on the counter and re-heat my grilled bacon and cheese from Tim Hortons. Perfect! I can literally follow instructions in cooking books without having to confirm wattage etc so definitely a win for RCA with this product!",
