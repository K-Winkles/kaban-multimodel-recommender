                "reviewText": "This purchase is of the exact same model Cuisinart Microwave that I bought thirteen years ago. And the only reason I'm replacing my old one is because the turntable recently stopped rotating. That being said, it's still microwaving and all the other functions are still up and running. I took my time browsing all the new microwaves on the market before deciding to buy the same make and model Cuisinart I've come to depend on. It's a large microwave and it's powerful. The digital soft push panel is easy to operate and keep clean. I enjoy the auto defrost feature and the pre programmed fast cook settings like popcorn, fresh veggies, baked potatoes, to name a few. The large interior fits full size plates so reheating leftovers like casoreles is easy. The interior is easy to clean and has a bright light. I also think it's a good looking appliance and solidly built. All microwaves make noise when running but I find this one to be one of the less annoying and lower decibels. I think the fact that my old one it's still working well after a decade, except for the turntable, says more about the quality than I can. I would never have chosen the exact same appliance this time around if I wasn't as pleased as I am. So if you're looking for a full size microwave from a brand that is synonymous with cooking, check this Cuisinart Microwave out. I think you'll like it as much as I do. I hope my experience helps you out a bit with your choice. Thank you!",

                "reviewText": "I just purchased this because it had features other microwaves did not. I'm writing because when I was reading all the reviews for this product i noticed that most reviews were for \"microwave/convection oven. NOT just reviews for microwave alone. So when making your decision read reviews carefully. Not sure why Amazon is including both products in these reviews as it appears to be a huge disservice. For space limitations, SS interior & a variety of multiple functions it is exactly what I am looking for. Another top rated model did NOT have an interior light. I'm replacing a 2002 GE which is now selling for over 300.00. After burning popcorn I had to live with the smell for weeks.Also burn marks on the light interior. Will not have a problem like this w/ss. I looked at every manufacturers microwave and for the money this was best for me. After I use this information will do a follow-up to let you know how it's working out.Received this yesterday. Used it 5 xs. Compared to my GE I had, it is a lot LESS noisie.The beeping when finished is NOT too loud for me. I'm over 60 and had NO problem reading the top Grey boxes w/lettering. Fit as expected. Looks very nice on counter. The handle is NO problem. When pulled it does not move forward. My only complaint would be the tinney sound when closing the door. However if made heavier I'm sure it would be more money. This review is for the MICROWAVE OVEN ONLY. NOT FOR THE MICRO/CONVECTION COMBO.OK, I said I would get back to you. Have reheated foods, coffee, cooked bacon, vegetables (fresh) boiled water, works like a dream. The glass plate inside is larger than my old one. Takes a muffin, roll from frozen to thaw in 20/25 seconds. I find I use the 30 second button more. The light inside is bright enough to see to clean when necessary. So yes I would recommend this microwave.",

                "reviewText": "So I bought this Cuisinart microwave six years ago. I've only needed to use two buttons on it, the \"Start +30 sec,\" and the \"Stop/ Clear,\" button. That's all you really need. Does anyone actually use all those other buttons?\u2014 DESIGN \u2014This is a clean and simple stainless steel and black design. The buttons are on a flat plastic surface that covers the actual physical button mechanism; this makes it very easy to clean as there aren't individual buttons to wipe around. The bottom legs can be rotated so you can adjust them for an uneven surface. The window to see your food is clear and it's easy to view how things are cooking. The handle to open it works without much physical effort. It's an all around nice design that would work well in most kitchen.\u2014 MICROWAVE FOOD COVER \u2014Food covers are a miracle product in helping the inside of your microwave remain splatter free. I have a Nordic Ware Microwave 10.5 Inch Spatter Cover and the simplicity and functionality of it is a required microwave accessory. When the cover gets dirty, give it a hand-wash and you're done. No need to wipe the inside of the microwave.\u2014 CLEANING \u2014For those times you actually have to clean the insides, I discovered a handy trick. Cut half a lemon (or cut a whole lemon), squeeze all the juice into a small bowl, add some water (1/4 cup or less), put the lemon juice along with the squeezed lemon in a bowl in the center of the platter, and microwave for three minutes. The water will steam the insides, and the citric acid from the lemon and juice will clean and loosen up any dried food on the inside. Food should wipe off easily after.I subtracted a star because the microwave got weird on me one time and started turning on by itself. I wasn't sure if it was a power surge or whatever, but I didn't use it for a few days and it has since worked without any issues.This microwave has lasted me through these last six years and a couple of apartment moves. I hope it continues to work for many years to come. Recommended.",

It cooks great,clock is right on the button. Came packed very well and with great care. Also does not show fingerprints SS inside and out side. Great price and a fantastic 3 YEAR WARRANTY. This is a great choice if you need a new microwave. Cuisinart CMW-100 IS THE BEST NO NEED TO TRY THE REST.",
