We use ours dozens of times per day and while disappointed it did not last longer - it is a wonderful product and value priced. The buttons and door latch are easy to push/activate. A real pleasure to operate.FYI - -it is made in china and the inverter uses chinese specific IGBT parts. That is what failed on mine. I ordered new ones, but took 2 weeks to arrive. As a DIYer, repair will be an experiment and is known to have deadly voltage potential. I expect repair success to be low since I lack $6K of test instruments, but it should be some fun.",

                "reviewText": "Initially I was annoyed with some of the user interface features, but I reminded myself that my old Sharp microwave lasted for 14 years and so I was very used to the way it worked and didn't really have to think about it. The longer I have used this Panasonic model the easier it has become to use. Plus, I could have gotten the new model for not much more and that appears to have an easier user face.Things I like:It looks really nice, very sleek and modernIt heats well and quicklyIt has a \"Quick 30\" button and I find myself using that the mostI has a Popcorn buttonit is lighter than my old one and takes up a little less space, but is just as powerfulThings I don't likeNo beverage button (though the new model has one. 3 presses of the Quick 30 takes care of thatThe light doesn't seem as strong as my old microwave, but it might be an illusion. If I turn off the kitchen light it seems just as strong and I think what is happening is that the kitchen light bounces off the shiny door and reflects back at you so it is harder to see insideNo button for common uses like Frozen Vegetables. I have to press the Sensor Cook 10 times for frozen vegetables. I got an index card and wrote down the number of times I must press Sensor Cook for the items I most often use. Now that I have gotten used to it it really isn't a big deal, just annoying at first.The cord sticks out from the back of the microwave, the plug sticks out from the outlet and the cord is not flexible as most aren't for this type of appliance so I have to have the machine pulled out a good five inches from the wall so the cord doesn't rest against the microwave. I am not sure if it is okay for it to touch or not. Unfortunately my outlet is directly behind the machine. This might not be a problem if you have your outlet in a different place.It is noisy, but no noisier than my old one, and maybe just a bit lessThe reason I gave it four stars is that it does its most important job well--heating food. So far everything has come out just the way I want it. And the longer I use it the easier it is to use.",

                "reviewText": "This purchase was to replace an earlier model of the same microwave. Some reviews are critical of the inverter, but reading the instructions will explain it's use and why it works as well as it does. There may be a few new bells and whistles on this newer one, but it still functions very well as a microwave oven. The previous one lasted for 10 years which, given today's products, is exceptional. Do read the instruction book however.",

                "reviewText": "I've been using the Panasonic Microwave Oven for a few months now, and I'm really impressed with it. It's got a strong 1200 watt power output, which means it heats food quickly and evenly. The interface is also very easy to use, with clear buttons and a large display. I especially like the Genius Sensor feature, which automatically adjusts the cooking time based on the weight of the food.Another thing I really like about this microwave is the slick design. It's black with a stainless steel finish, and it looks great on my countertop. The interior is also very spacious, so I can easily fit a large plate of food inside.Overall, I'm really happy with the Panasonic Microwave Oven. It's powerful, easy to use, and looks great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new microwave.Here are some of the pros and cons of the Panasonic Microwave Oven:Pros:- Powerful 1200 watt power output- Easy to use interface- Genius Sensor feature- Slick design- Spacious interiorCons:- NoneOverall, I think the Panasonic Microwave Oven is a great choice for anyone looking for a powerful and easy-to-use microwave. It's got a sleek design and a spacious interior, and the Genius Sensor feature is really helpful for automatically adjusting the cooking time. If you're looking for a new microwave, I would definitely recommend checking out the Panasonic Microwave Oven.",

I was going to buy another brand but a friend recommended Panasonic so I started doing my research and found this inverter technology is good to have.. the apperance is really nice without any buttons or handle poking out. it cooks as 1200 watts has a big glass cooking tray and I can choose the power levels that I'm still experimenting with. But so far for the price I paid I couldn't go wrong AND am totally glad my friend recommended Panasonic and Amazon had my ideal microwave..",

Su teclado digital hace muy f\u00e1cil programar el tiempo de cocci\u00f3n o recalentado con precisi\u00f3n de minutos y segundos, por ejemplo 2 minutos y 13 segundos. Su interior es relativamente peque\u00f1o, pero suficiente para cocinar algo como para 4 personas, quiz\u00e1 no m\u00e1s. Calienta muy bien en un menor tiempo que el anterior horno que tuve, ya que es m\u00e1s moderno. Estoy muy satisfecho con mi compra. Supongo que tendr\u00e1 larga vida \u00fatil como el anterior. Este tiene escasamente un mes. Recomiendo desconectarlo cuando no est\u00e9 en uso o conectarlo a un multicontacto que tenga apagador. De esta manera se protege contra fluctuaciones de la corriente cuando est+a apagado, y no consume electricidad.",
