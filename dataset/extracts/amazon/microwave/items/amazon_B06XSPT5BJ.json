Con is that the lid does snap on or is tight and my microwave is higher up and trying to take out without lid coming loose was alittle worrisome of me getting burned especially since I'm not 6ft. I had to use to clothes to grab by handles. Knowing thus just be careful it's not a good enough reason to not buy. Works great",
