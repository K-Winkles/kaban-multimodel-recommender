                "reviewText": "I had to take this brand new microwave apart to properly install the insert nut. At the top of the unit, there are 2 square holes where these insert nuts clip into. One wasn't present. I had to remove the housing from the microwave to find the fallen insert within it. Then, being the non microwave tech that i am, put it together wrong and then installed the unit. So i will later have to take it back down to take it apart to slide the front flaps in and then put it all back together again. Great product. Too much work for a new microwave.",
