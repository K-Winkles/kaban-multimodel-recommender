Well in the midst of searching I found this combo set for the same price or actually even cheaper than the other baking soda holders for odor containers. I thought they was small though by the pics in the listing. Maybe it was just me but I thought they was small. I was quite surprised when they arrived bc they are a pretty good size. That's a good thing I suppose. In the last photo you can see the \"hot momma\" with her wig taken off. They both function that way but that's how you fill her with water or the \"chilly momma\" with baking soda. You just twist the hair .. clockwise I think it is. There's really not much that can break and they seem pretty sturdy so I don't foresee having any problems. I have no complaints but there is one small criticism. The chilly momma has a detachable hand you have to install. It bothers me though bc if you look her hand is backwards. Unless I'm missing something it's a design flaw lol not a big deal though. These things are pretty cool though!",
