        "description": "With a 0. 9-Cubic-Foot capacity, this RCA microwave oven allows for quick and convenient meal preparation. The unit's one-touch auto-cook menu takes the guesswork out of cooking popularly microwaved foods including popcorn, baked potatoes, pizza, beverages, and frozen dinners, while its reheat button makes it easy to warm food items back up again. The microwave's soft-touch electronic control panel also comes with cook-by-weight and defrost-by-weight options, speed defrost that alternates between defrost and stand times for efficient results, a start/stop button, and a reset button to clear all previous settings. Choose from 10 power levels for added versatility and control. Other highlights include a removable glass turntable, a handy digital clock and kitchen timer, child safety-lock protection, and an end-of-cycle audio signal, which helps prevent mugs of reheated tea or coffee from being forgotten about. The glass turntable cleans up easily by hand or in the dishwasher, and the interior and exterior of the appliance can be wiped down with a damp cloth as needed. With 900W of power, this microwave is powerful enough for all your cooking needs. This RCA microwave has a sleek design and would add some flare to any kitchen, dorm or office.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered the stainless model for my mom and had it sent to her house. The good reviews and the pull handle door are why I ordered it...she wanted the pull handle type. What I received was a similar model (RMW1178-B) that does not have a pull handle. Besides that being aggravating, if you lightly press on the button to open the door the microwave will power up and run as long as you hold it. I looked in the manual to see if this was an intentional feature, but found nothing about it. My mom said it works good, but I'm wondering how long that will be with the opener doing that.",

It arrived early and was well packaged. Not much of a learning curve. Operation is similar to my old one. Even though it's only a compact o.9 cu. ft. , my large dinner plate fits nicely inside. Very pleased with purchase. I would recommend this product.",

As a red appliance is meant to stand out. This part of the design needs better thinking. Never seen a microwave quite this hard to keep clean.",

Only 2 things I would mention is that it is not the quietest unit I have ever owned (but it's not super noisy either) and also it's missing a quick minute button where you don't also have to press \"Start\". (Or a quick 30-second button.) We sure loved that feature on our old microwave oven. Another reviewer mentioned a smell. We haven't found that our unit had a smell. We've been using ours for 5 weeks now and are very happy with the purchase so far.",
