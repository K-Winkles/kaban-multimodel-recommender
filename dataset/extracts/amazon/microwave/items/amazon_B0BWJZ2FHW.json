                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Nice microwave, but \"notification\" sound is extremely annoying",
                "reviewText": "I selected this microwave due to it's sleek/modern appearance and it's features. Looks did not disappoint, but it does take daily maintenance to keep fingerprints wiped from the all-black surface. Since there is no \"handle\", fingerprints are abundant.Everything works fine, and since I had it professionally installed during a kitchen remodel, I can't speak to installation process.My two complaints are: 1) I miss having the type of \"express\" functionality where you can just press \"1\" for 1 minute, \"2\" for 2 minutes, etc. Without that functionality, you have to press 5 times and hear those associated \"beeps\", instead of just one (i.e. \"stop/reset\", \"1\"-\"0\"-\"0\", \"start\", instead of \"1\" then \"start\". 2) the \"finish\" notification beeping is drawn out into 3 sets of 3 very long drawn-out beeps: BEEEEEEEEEP, BEEEEEEEP, BEEEEEEEP, and again BEEEEEEEP, BEEEEEEEP, BEEEEEEEP, and then again BEEEEEEEP, BEEEEEEP, BEEEEEEP. I don't know if goes beyond that because I've learned to RUN AS FAST AS I CAN to open the dang door so it will just shut up. Unfortunately, I've found no way to de-program that notification sound.Realizing I have become very sensitized to sounds like this due to my spouse's sound-aversion issue, this may not even come up on another's radar as an issue. But, at least I'm getting some quick spurts of aerobic activity as I sprint to the unit when it's finished a cycle and screams at me repeatedly. LOL.",
