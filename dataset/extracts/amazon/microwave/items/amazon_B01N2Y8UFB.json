                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Causes microwave error",
                "reviewText": "Updated again: I have the red one at home, and brought the dark grey container to work, but am not able to use it in the microwave at work because for some reason it sets off an electrical storm in the microwave - as if I put metal in the microwave, but I didn't. At first I blamed it on the Popcorn setting and thought the microwave had an error, but now I can't use it on any setting without this happening. I have never had the problem with the red one when used at home - only with the dark grey one.Previously Updated Review: This product is a little stiff when it first arrives, which causes the lid flaps to flip open while popping and popcorn ends up all over the microwave. However, after the first time it happened, I worked the lid flaps at the crease several times, and really folded them down towards the center of the container, so that they would stay closed better. This is something that could have been done prior to first use, had I known what the issue was. I am so glad I fixed the issue, because there is no other \"single serve\" popping container on Amazon, that I could find. The popcorn comes out really nice and crispy/crunchy/light. Since I'm using it at work, and trying to be healthy, I use a spray dispenser to spray the popcorn with olive oil, then salt it directly in the container. Very tasty! (p.s. at home I use a spray dispenser with butter when indulging). So the container is the perfect size for me to enjoy popcorn directly from the popper. Yes, there are quite a few kernals leftover, but for me that is fine because if all of those popped, this would be a little more than my idea of a single serve. And they warn you not to use less popcorn than the fill line or it will burn - so those kernals are helping to fill what I would have as a void if I was popping fewer, if that makes any sense. I love this little thing.Old Review:The lid flaps won't stay down while popping, and popcorn was flying all over the microwave. I had to stop the microwave a few times, and the stopping and starting the microwave to try to put the lid back down or find some way to cover it with a paper towel didn't help the popping process. Ultimately the popcorn burned, which has only happened to me when I stop and start it in the middle of popping. So, I won't be using this at work again.",

However, I searched and found a video of a trick to keep the flaps closed and that changed everything. After putting the flaps down just ease one corner out and the cup will stay closed the whole time. It is still a little on the small side for me but at least it is all staying in the cup and that makes a big difference.",

                "reviewText": "I saw these at Whole Foods and though they were a great idea, so I bought them.I like them. I think they pop popcorn well, at least once you do some trial and error with ingredients and your microwave and the poppers themselves. I like that I can make a single serving of popcorn. The built-in measuring device works pretty well, and it's easy to clean. I like that it's one piece. And although it's not specific to this popper, it's nice to be able to customize your popcorn with any combo of fat (coconut oil! olive oil! butter!) and seasonings (cheese! salt! more butter! spicy stuff!) that you want.However, of the two I bought, the flaps on the orange one don't stay down, and the flaps on the grey one only stay down if I put the \"top\" flap (the one with the logo on it) on the bottom and put the \"bottom\" flap on the top. This seems to be some sort of manufacturing defect with either the thickness or width of the \"seams\" where the flaps fold down. The orange one not working properly is why I took two stars off. If they both worked as well as the grey one, I'd give this product 5 stars.A couple tips:1) If you find that your popper pops open too soon and starts spewing greasy, molten-hot popcorn kernels over your microwave, dampen a paper towel and put it over the top of the popper before you start the microwave. That way, even if one flap pops open too soon, the paper towel will stop any rogue kernels. This is the only way I've been able to use my orange popper, and frankly, it helps with the grey popper too, just because occasionally kernels pop out of the side vents (also, if you overfill the popper, it contains the overflow.)2) I think adding oil or butter makes the popcorn taste about 100x better. So yes, you can add oil and it still works just fine. It doesn't take a lot; I think I usually use about half a teaspoon of butter, although I think you could get away with less.3) Usually I add the kernels and butter/oil, then heat the whole thing up for 20 seconds to melt the butter. Add a seasoning (I mix salt with a turmeric seasoning that's delicious but stains everything yellow -- https://amazon.com/dp/B079W3DLZL/ref=twister_B07D3NZPXG), stir it up, put a paper towel over the top, then back in the microwave for 2 minutes and 30 seconds. At work, I found that the microwave would start burning the popcorn before most of the kernels were popped, so I set that microwave to 90% power. At home, I can use full power. The popcorn is usually done with 30-45 seconds left on the timer, but it's important to listen for it and watch it carefully.",

                "reviewText": "Purchased Joseph M-Cuisine Microwave Popcorn Popper. This is a great item if you do not want a whole bag of popcorn. It allows you to purchase a bag of corn and make a single portion of popcorn. It is easy to use and clean. You can add butter and other flavors without burning your fingers.I like this method because i do not know what is all in the pre made microwave bags that are everywhere. The neat thing is the silicone cup allows you to cook or bake other items besides popcorn in the microwave.",

Used for the first time last night and as soon as the popcorn started popping the flap came up so I had popcorn and butter EVERYWHERE in my microwave. Did it pop the popcorn, yes, but not sure I will use again because of the flap issue.",

The silicone makes it easy to clean, and the measuring system they use is the best. Because it's small, it is super easy to store and doesn't require a whole cabinet to itself. I 100% recommend this.",
