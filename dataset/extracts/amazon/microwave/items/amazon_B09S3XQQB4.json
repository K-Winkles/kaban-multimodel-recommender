                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Microwave with Unparalleled Style",
                "reviewText": "I used the microwave a month to make sure it wouldn't fall apart...based on some of the reviews here, I'm lucky the rotating plate didn't break, the handle didn't fall off, or the oven didn't burn down the kitchen. Instead, it survived, though it's only been a month, so who knows. Bottom line, this microwave is not only the best-looking microwave I've ever had, it's the easiest I've ever used. Hit the big round button and it turns on for one minute, then rotate the button to quickly scale your time up or down. There are a bunch of other features that are also easy to understand for anyone with a fifth grade education, but I've cooked meals and reheated items more than once a day for a month and I'm delighted with the overall performance.Yes, the interior light only comes on when the oven is running, not when you open the door. Are the other reviewers blind or something? That just isn't a big deal. Yes, it beeps three times when the cooking session ends. I don't live in a monastery under a vow of silence, so that's okay. The beeping is no louder than any other microwave I've owned. Yes, the power plug forces the microwave to sit about 2\u00bd inches from the wall (see pics)...and the owners manual recommends it sit 3 inches from the wall for venting purposes. I'm okay with that.None of the hundreds of other reviews showed photos of the black version of the microwave, so I'm showing it in several pictures here. It is a handsome devil, even in black, and it harmonizes beautifully with my granite countertop. The interior is plenty big enough for a standard dinner plate (see pics), and therefore big enough for any frozen dinner.The 800 watts of power is slightly less than my usual 900 or 1,100 watts, but it cooks well and cooks evenly. I just follow the directions on a frozen dinner (which are written for 1,100 watt microwaves), maybe adding 10 or 20 seconds to the timing, and it comes out piping hot. Anyone who says it doesn't heat has a bad microwave and should return the oven within a week of purchasing...not sit around complaining about it.So I love my microwave. If it breaks in six months or six years, I'll just buy another one (hopefully when they are on sale, like I did this time). For intuitive microwavers like myself, it is unbelievably easy to use. And it's the most attractive retro-style microwave on the market, whatever color you choose, and it's really not a very close competition with any other design. I could not be happier.",

The blue matches tile in my kitchen and it is just SO CHARMING. It works great, love the knob option (versus buttons to push to control time, etc). Its fairly quiet while on, too. The only thing I don't love is the alert when it's done. Three very loud chimes and there's no way out of it unless you open the door prematurely. Other than that, it's simply a great microwave!",

There's a handy express button for 30 seconds, and a power level button that takes a minute to learn but lets you custom defrost. There are 12 cooking modes but who uses those, really? This tool is solid, looks ok, fits a 10.5 inch dinner plate. Five stars.",

It has some pre-set cook times, can adjust power, and is pretty compact, but for the price, I would've liked a few more comfort features than the bare minimum, such as a timer setting or even just the time displayed. And I move the whole microwave when trying to open the door, despite the microwave itself being pretty heavy.Overall happy with it, as it's super cute and does what I need, but I've had to get a timer and clock to supplement what a microwave normally does.",

While the dial isn't flimsy, it may not stand up to serious abuse.I got the orange color. It's slightly more creamsicle than orange, but still looks good.",
