                "reviewText": "Ok. I\u2019ve used this for about three months and thought it time to write a review based on more than instant reactions. Admittedly, we haven\u2019t had a new counter top microwave since forever, so one has to assume progress has been made, and that that old Sharp microwave has had its day. Nonetheless, this Farberware microwave is really, really good, not just for the money, not just compared to the old Sharp, but objectively in its own right. For us, a quiet unit was nonnegotiable. (We suffered with a Viking over the range microwave, about as quiet as a 747 on takeoff, for years before switching to a GE\u2014and realized we had been suffering needlessly. The old Sharp was clearly failing. Still, it had a wonderful design, with the controls across the top, rather than down the right side. This meant a relatively small box could hold a very large plate. True, the numbers stopped reading. True, the beep eventually stopped beeping. The time setting could no longer we trusted...So after studying reviews and specs like a divinity student trying to Devine the meaning of god, we decided to go with this unit. What a joy: quiet, warms foods up quickly, the \u2018soften\u2019 feature really softens, and the automatic reheat feature works fairly well. It has three instant on buttons (1, 2, and 3 minutes, respectively) plus a 30 second on button. So if you need a minute and a half, it\u2019s touch \u20181\u2019, then touch \u2018On-30seconds\u2019 and done. Is it perfect? No. We\u2019d wish the display were backlit because reading all those little buttons is challenging. Did I say it was quiet?",

                "reviewText": "I usually take awhile before writing a review for complex items like major electronics. Now, after nearly two years owning this microwave, I am ready to report on my opinions. I'm sure you are thrilled! Why wouldn't you be?I am a very logical person and like the items I buy to logically designed as well. First. the good things about this product. This microwave is more quiet than most. My previous Panasonic, which died after about 20 years, could be heard from my bedroom on the opposite side of the house, with my door closed. This one is much less annoying in this aspect. It also cooks well. Most frozen dinners can be followed by the package times and turn out well. My Panasonic was much too powerful and I had to reduce suggested times by about 25%.The interior is unusual, being a medium gray color but it's easy to clean. The unit emits like 5 beeps when it finishes unless you open the door, then stops immediately.Where it loses one star for me is in the operation logic. I has one-button time/cook for 1, 2, and 3 minutes and 30 seconds if you just press START. I would have been thrilled had it carried this logic over for 4 through 10 minutes since those numbers (zero for 10) are already there. A lot of frozen meals call for 4 minutes. It would be nice to just press \"4\" instead of having to locate the \"Time Cook\" button, then pressing 4-0-0 and then Start. One button instead of five, no contest. You also can't add those one-touch buttons to the current time except for the 30-second Start button.The other thing that really annoys me is that you cannot set a time for cooking something a bit later, like you're doing other cooking on a stove and you want to have the microwave queued up for, say, steaming vegetables. You just can't do it because if you set a time and don't start it, about a minute later, the timer will reset to zero. On the other hand, if you're cooking something and decide to stop before the timer ends, like you often do with popcorn, the time will remain forever unless you clear it. So, if you get up the next morning and press a button, it won't function because it still has time on it. They got this completely backward: It should keep the time time you set forever but reset time that was left on it when you stopped it. See? Logical.If you can live with these two annoyances, this is a fine microwave to own.",

                "reviewText": "Great stand-alone microwave, and attractive appearance! Priced lower than any of comparable quality that I could find locally! Plenty of \"special use\" selections. Powerful - pops a large bag of Pop Secret in 1 minute and 40 seconds! Versatile setting, and simple-to-set clock! (For the DST haters!) Easy to clean, easy to use!",
