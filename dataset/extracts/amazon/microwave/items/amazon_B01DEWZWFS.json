Pressing +30 seconds requires you to press START afterwards. Come on, I want it to start automatically!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Totally in love with this microwave! It's a little bit deeper than our previous Panasonic, so it covers the entire depth of our counter, and I paid a good chunk more thanks to inflation and the chip shortage than this microwave would go for in prior years. But other than those complaints, I'm very happy. The buttons are very tactile, with the pads actually sticking out from the flat surface. If you are blind or vision impaired, this is very sensory friendly! Particularly like the detail where the number buttons are round and the auto program and start and stop buttons are rectangles. The button to push the door shut is also recessed inside the lower right panel rather than being the entirety of the panel. For those of you who have the appliance inside a cabinet with a trim kit, you'll find it nice that the door open button isn't the entirety of the lower right corner like on other Panasonic panels \u2014 I end up rubbing up against the cabinet or counter and leaving fingerprints.Speaking of fingerprints, the stainless steel model is definitely a magnet for them. Thankfully, there really isn't that much stainless steel on the front of this appliance (unlike, say, your fridge or dishwasher). Much of the front is comprised of the glass window. The fingerprints that I did leave were easily wiped off with a microfiber cloth, no cleaning solution needed.The light inside is very bright and white in color (my previous microwave had a yellow light inside). I'm a big fan of the Panasonic inverter technology. It really sets it apart from other microwaves. My food is always cooked evenly. Final bonus: my wifi doesn't seem to be interrupted by the heating of my food.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great microwave. I loved using it and met all our needs. I love the inverter technology and the sensor cook and sensor reheat (most of the time). However, 2 and a half years since I purchased it, it all of a sudden stopped working. The buttons didn't work at all. No appliance repair company would fix it stating the couldn't find the parts and I couldn't find the parts myself - probably the control board. So i had purchased it for $180 at the time, So to replace it I ordered another one through Amazon. That one arrived quickly but there as chip in the upper left corner of the door as well as a scrape leading to it. The box it was in had no sign of any damage. So it seems that Panasonic packed a damaged item in a new box. So I asked for a replacement of this item I am planning on returning. I received it within a couple of days and the same damage with the corner of the door chipped and a scrape leading up to it was on the replacement! The box was not damaged near that part of the microwave. However, the other side of the box was damaged and there was a dent in the wall of the microwave due to that. Needless to say will be returning this one but Amazon will not replace an item a second time so I paid for another microwave and will return both of these. I really do like this microwave for our family of 5 and discussed this with customer service. I will return both of those and am crossing my fingers that the third is a charm and does not come damaged. What would be the chances, right? It is scheduled to arrive in two days. We will see and will be crossing my fingers in the meantime. It is just disconcerting that Panasonic is packaging damaged microwaves in new boxes and selling them as new. Just a warning.",

                "reviewText": "Very powerful and well-sized unit. I use this primarily to reheat leftovers though works very well for cooking, melting and defrosting. The LED light is very bright (a good thing) and you can see the item that you're nuking. I am not convinced that the reheat sensor works and don't like to risk overheating my food so I shut it down before the unit shuts off. Nice feature if it works, though not enough for me to take a full star away from this review. I like the finish which matches my other ss appliances though be aware the box is painted bright grey, it is not SS as is the front. Popcorn setting pops almost every kernel with no burning. Reheating liquid or leftovers takes very little time. Unit is not too loud. The door opener (button) sometimes gets stuck when pressed in, though pops out when you close the door. Don't know if this is a defect or just needs some lube, though I can't immediately see where I can lube the button. Excellent value for such power.",
