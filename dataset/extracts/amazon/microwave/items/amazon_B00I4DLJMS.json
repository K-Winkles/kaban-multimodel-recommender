Navigate your new countertop microwave with a digital control panel with 10 power levels, as well as 6 one-touch menu buttons to heat common foods like popcorn, beverages, potatoes, pizza, frozen food, and more. How do the Speed Defrost and Cook by Weight settings work? Speed Defrost is a convenient feature that quickly thaws frozen food, where the microwave operates at a lower power level and alternates between short bursts of cooking and periods of rest. Should you stir your food occasionally while microwaving it? Stir foods such as casseroles and vegetables while cooking to distribute heat evenly. Food at the outside of the dish absorbs more energy and heats more quickly, so stir from the outside to the center.",

                "reviewText": "I recently added the Commercial Chef Countertop Microwave to my kitchen, and for its size and price, it's a solid choice. Here's the lowdown on this little culinary warrior: Compact Yet Spacious: This microwave might be small, but it punches above its weight class with a 1.1 cubic feet capacity. You can easily fit most dinner plates and bowls, making it more versatile than its compact design suggests. Efficient Heating: It's not the flashiest microwave in town, but it does its job efficiently. Whether you're reheating leftovers, defrosting, or whipping up a quick bag of popcorn, it gets the job done. Simple to Use: The controls are straightforward and user-friendly. You won't need a degree in microwave technology to figure it out. It's a no-fuss appliance. Clean and Classic: The white exterior gives it a clean and timeless look that can blend in with any kitchen decor. It won't be an eyesore on your countertop. Decent Build Quality: It doesn't feel like a flimsy piece of plastic. The build quality is decent, and it seems durable enough to withstand regular use. Lacks Advanced Features: If you're after a microwave with tons of fancy features, this isn't it. It's more like the dependable sedan of microwaves, not the sports car with all the bells and whistles. Noisy Operation: While it gets the job done, it can be a bit louder than some of its counterparts. So, if you're looking for a library-level hush while your food cooks, you might be in for a surprise. In conclusion, the Commercial Chef Countertop Microwave is a practical and budget-friendly choice for basic microwave needs. It's not a gourmet chef's dream, but it's the reliable workhorse you need for everyday tasks. If you're okay with a no-frills microwave that gets the job done without breaking the bank, this little guy deserves a spot on your countertop. Four stars for its compact kitchen heroics!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Love it! 5 major pros, 3 minor cons...",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this to replace a button-based model, and here's what I know after having used this for several months: *Pros 1) Quick and easy to set temp and time. My last microwave took anywhere between 5-10 separate button presses to set power level and cook time; if I pressed the wrong thing, I had to clear and do it all over again. This model is just two turns of a dial, at the most, regardless of what temp or time I want. 2) Power level can be adjusted without stopping the microwave. In addition to reheating tea and leftovers, I do a lot of legit cooking in this - things like rice, quinoa, polenta, potatoes for mashing. That can call for longer, lower cooking times and I love being able to adjust power level at any time without resetting. 3) It's just one quick pleasant \"ding\" when done. My old digital microwave had 5 piercing beeps that persisted even if I opened the door on the first beep; if not opened, it beeps again. Personally, I don't need such a persistent reminder, especially if I happen to be on a call (I work from home, so this happens more often for me now). I often found myself racing to my previous microwave to turn it off right before it was done so I wouldn't have to hear the super loud beeps. 4) It doesn't slide on the counter since it's not push-operated. My microwave is not backed by a wall. My previous unit would slide on the counter when I push the buttons to set time or open the door, and I was always a little nervous it would get pushed off the counter. Because this one is turn dials, it doesn't get pushed and doesn't slide on the counter. The door opens and closes easily so pushing and pulling on that part is not enough to move the unit. *I'll add that I have another appliance stacked on top of the microwave which adds a little more weight. But even if I didn't, I don't think opening/closing the door would make it slide. 5) The door can be left open to air out. This microwave only lights up while it's running, NOT when the door is open. If I heat something that steams up the inside, I can just leave the door open to air it out so things don't get humid and stinky in there over time. (see photo) 5) My Breville countertop/toaster oven fits perfectly on top. To save space, I wanted a microwave that was just big enough to fit my Breville on top, and this one works perfectly. Most other units I saw on Amazon were much larger than this (more counter space than I wanted to give up), or too small to handle what I need. (see photo) *Cons (very minor) 1) I wish I could more reliably set time under 1 minute. Sometimes I just want to warm a biscuit which takes like 7-10 seconds, but the time dial isn't sensitive enough to accurately set for under 1 minute. In my video, you can see how there's little resistance on the dial, and the microwave doesn't turn on until it's closer to a full minute. Not a deal breaker, I just stand by for those quick heating times. If I turn the dial way up to 2+ minutes then wind down, I can get it to heat at some time under 30 seconds. That's still useful for things that are less sensitive than bread....like reheating a still-warm drink. 2) I wish there were a way to feel when the dial is at one of the whole-minute marks, at least for the first 5 or 10 minutes on the dial, and maybe even for 30 second increments. This would be a great feature especially for folks with any kind of visual impairment since the numbers are small. I'd love this improvement on the power level dial as well - to feel the dial click into place for each of the main power level settings. 3) This microwave does not have a digital display, so it won't be a clock or timer. NBD for me, but wanted to mention in case it matters to some of you. *Overall I like this 2-dial microwave leaps and bounds over any of the button-push models I've ever owned, and am not going back to a push-button style any time soon.",
