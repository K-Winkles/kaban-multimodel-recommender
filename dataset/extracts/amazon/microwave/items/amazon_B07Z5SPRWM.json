After popped, added a little salt and sprinkled some Parmesan cheese. And storage is so convenient; it collapses neatly. I used to own the electric presto popper but that took up so much cabinet space. And I love that you avoid the toxicity of the bagged popcorn. Lastly, price cannot be beaten!

                "reviewText": "My hubby rolled his eyes when i told him i wanted this popper. I have ended up donating so many air poppers that he kept buying the bagged microwave popcorn.Omg this works like a charm! I ended up cooking mine 2 min 20 sec on high because our microwave tends to burn on the popcorn setting. There was no burning, very few unpopped, and no oil used at all! Aside from that you can used the bowl to eat it from. I might get a second one! It also collapses down and is super easy to store. I'm really thrilled with it.",

                "reviewText": "I had purchased air poppers, have eaten popcorn made on the stove, and of course had bags of microwavable popcorn, but this is by far the easiest, best tasting popcorn yet. No need to pre-oil or anything, just pour in a set amount and set at 4 mins (my microwave setting) and voila! I had a family member visiting when I showed him this and he was so impressed with it (he makes it on the stove usually) he had called other family members and told them about this popcorn \"thingy\". Since he was so impressed with it I ended up buying a second one and sending it to him. This thing does what it claims; easy to make popcorn, easy to clean, and it's silicone material makes it easy to pop down flat and store easily. Makes a great little gift for those who love popcorn in your life",

This product is great for someone that doesn\u2019t have a lot of room in the kitchen as well. I have a small kitchen and this pops down flat and goes right into a drawer. This is the most evenly popped popcorn I have had even better than bagged popcorn almost all the seeds were popped and none of the popcorn was burned. Also you don\u2019t worry about it being plastic leaching bad things into your popcorn and if you wanna have healthy no oil popcorn this is easy to do or you could melt some coconut oil and put it right in there, I made a pomegranate popcorn and put dark chocolate as a Christmas snack. I like the fact this isn\u2019t glass I looked at a lot of popcorn poppers on Amazon and there were a lot of glass ones and with a small child that would be not a good idea and you don\u2019t have to worry about this breaking. My favorite part is it doesn\u2019t take any room and affordable. It was an all-around awesome purchase.",
