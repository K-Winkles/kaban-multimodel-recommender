                "reviewText": "I used a different brand microwave for the last 5-10 years, each microwave lasted about 5 years. I decided to try a different brand, so I bought the Farberware because it was the same size as our other micrwaves 2.2 cu ft. A new appliance takes a bit of getting used to, as the controls are different than your previous one. At first I didn't like this microwave because you have to press the cook time button before entering the cooking time, because the first six digits on the number pad are quick start times (1 min, 2 min, 3 min etc). That is the only feature I didn't like. The start button is automatically 30 seconds, which I use more than any other time. The memory button is easy to set up to input specific times. Simply pressing the 1 on the number pad starts the microwave for 1 minute without pressing a start button, which is great. The microwave cooks incredibly even - way better than any microwave I've had in the past. I like the darker interior and this microwave is QUIET!!! Definitely a 5 star microwave and a definite recommend...",

                "reviewText": "Packed well which is a good thing since there was some damage to the exterior of the box. We just use the microwave for the usual stuff. Works perfectly. There's a lot of technology and value here for the price point. Interior light is subdued but effective enough. People nitpick about the non-illuminated keypad but the numbers are located in the same formation as anything else has been for decades so that's automatic to get used to easy peasy. Strong enough, interior big enough. A bargain for this price point. Recommended.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Dangerously imperfect technology",
                "reviewText": "UPDATE: The grill function shorted out exactly 2 years after I got it, burning out a ground fault interrupter in the process. The electrician\u2019s bill was higher than the price of the oven. Good thing I had a gfi! When I removed it from the counter, I also discovered the mess in the photo. The oven is too heavy to move regularly to clean, although I did wipe up the counter under the edge of the door fairly often and wondered where the stuff I wiped was coming from. I bought it mostly to avoid having both a toaster oven and a microwave on my counter. It made halfway decent light toast from a frozen slice, although that took 11 minutes, and the Combi setting was helpful for crisping the edges of pie crust on reheated quiche. (Both of those things can be done better and faster by an air fryer that I bought more recently. An air fryer is just a convection oven with a small footprint - who knew?) The interior light never worked. BOTTOM LINE: having tried two combinations ovens from two different manufacturers, I conclude that combining a microwave with an oven function is a technology not yet perfected. At least the price of this one wasn\u2019t as high as the first one!ORIGINAL POSTI just got this, replacing a convection microwave whose heating element died. It was a great price, under $100 - I don\u2019t know whether that will remain in effect. Controls are much simpler than the convection/microwave unit, which was ridiculously complicated. I haven\u2019t tried to clean it, but it looks ordinary. The four stars reflect a very minimal interior light and, especially, a really inadequate manual, especially concerning the grill. I want to toast bread - my old oven took 10 minutes to defrost and just barely crisp a slice of frozen bread on grill feature, with no browning. This oven has a Grill setting and 2 Combi grill and microwave functions. No information about how to use the Combi settings or how they differ.Fairly extensive online research suggests preheating the grill for 1 minute. The grill and oven definitely get hot, leading to risk of skin burns (!) if you touch the interior or the metal grill after using the Grill feature. Grilling a slice of frozen bread without preheating is slower than a toaster would be. The combo alternates microwave with grill function (both the sound and the lighted icons indicate this), but the bread is tough and not yet browned. There appear to be 2 levels of Combi, but I have no idea why.TOAST TEST: good news! When I Grill a frozen piece of bread for 8 minutes, the top is slightly crisp and the bottom is moist like fresh bread. After 12 minutes, the top (facing the roof, where there is an oven-type element) is slightly brown. Perfect light toast color and crunch. The underside is slightly crisp although not brown. Flipping mid-cycle may result in equal sides but I haven\u2019t tried that. CAUTION: Use tongs or risk serious burns.Combi is not useful, overcooks the bread in the center and leaves it tough. It\u2019s probably great for thawing and \u201cbrowning\u201d a frozen pizza or casserole. I have not seen evidence that the metal grill rack gets hot enough to leave marks on the food - maybe with more time.",
