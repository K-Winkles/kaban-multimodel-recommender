                "reviewText": "My family started using Microwave ovens in the late 1970's they were enormous back then but they were powerful and did a good job.The first one I purchased for myself was a 1100 watt magic chef in the late 1980's it travelled with me for decades and worked great for something like 20 years and was still working when I gave it to a friend.Then in the 2000's I noticed a shift where it was not common to find 1100 watt microwaves and it has continued till this day where 1000 watts is where most top out.Anyway there have been other microwaves all pretty much disappointing in performance and as of recently I said that's it! I want a high performance microwave with a good interior size no more of these cramped 1.2 CF interiors and purchased this one as the exterior dimensions are not that much greater at 1.6 CF interior room.When I received this one I was at first amazed how light weight it is compared to the one it was replacing and realized it is the inverter technology lightening things up. It is so light weight in fact it will skid across the table opening and closing it.No problem I just put some drawer liners under the feet to keep it from sliding around.When I plugged it in for the first time it made a horrible noise I thought what the heck this is brand new where is this noise coming from?? at first I thought it was a bad gear in the turn table mechanism and tried to turn it with my fingers to feel if there was anything wrong with it but it was tight which it should be.After turning it on and off a few times I zeroed in on the sound and discovered it was a fan hitting something internally so being a technician I took the cowling off being very mindful not to touch any high energy components like capacitors or come in contact with wiring which could be potentially lethal.Note: It does require tamper proof Torx head screw drivers or a very good precision set of Torx drivers to remove the case screws to get into the appliance.Note: I do not recommend or endorse nor encourage that anyone should do as I have done but illustrate an issue with Quality Control on Toshibas part and the actions I took to correct it so others are aware when making this purchase they may encounter the same issue.Note: People who are unfamiliar with electricity, electronics or working with and around High Voltages weather it be DC or AC Circuits should not attempt to open one of these units as it can be lethal. Certain components like capacitor's will carry a lethal charge of electricity that can last for weeks even when unplugged and it can kill you.Note: I myself have been an electronics Technician in many professional work environments including appliance repair for decades and am still learning and always wary of touching anything I do not understand and even more cautious of touching things I do understand.I then discovered a metal duct work for channeling the air over components was not installed correctly (see picture included with this review) and I needed to bend it to get it out of the way of the fan blades, Two screws later and cautiously removing the shroud using insulated magnetic tools then a quick bend with a pair of needle nose plyers replaced the shroud and the problem was solved.After repairing this minor Issue, the Microwave works better than any I have ever used.Coffee & tea perfectly hot within 1 minute and I like mine HOT.Cook times are greatly reduced and the cooking is more even.Defrost by weight works perfectly, amazingly so.The feature to turn off the chimes is priceless no more stupid loud dinging when starting and finishing a cook cycle.When you turn off the noise however the kitchen timer also does not make noise.The microwave is also extremely quiet when running.All in all I am very pleased with this Microwave and hope what I experienced was just a one off, otherwise Toshiba had better get there Quality Control act together or there are going to be allot of returns for a very simple issue that should never have been permitted to leave the factory.",

                "reviewText": "Oooh, my...there is nothing that I would improve upon. It is easy to use, and the touch keyboard and lighting are perfect. Experimenting with different foods is essential, but now I wouldn't have any other unit. It is at the perfect money/performance point. I fix eggs, ordeal, grits, assorted meats, and vegetables. It does a baked potato perfectly. My coffee mug is heated in 30 seconds, hot, but not too hot. I absolutely love this unit.",

It has most of the features I was looking for, especially a mute button for the audible beeps, something that is very convenient when you share a kitchen with people who work third shift. This makes it much easier to use and not annoy people who are trying to sleep. The only feature I wish it had, and had I known it did not have it I would have purchased another microwave, was a backlight for the keypad and lcd panel. Unless your kitchen is well lit, it is very hard to see which buttons you are pressing. if a backlight is not a requirement for you, this is a great microwave and it works awesome.",

                "reviewText": "First off, i'm a repeat panasonic microwave person and after the 3rd death, I decided to break the curse and go with Toshiba. After a ton of research, this came out to be more powerful and only slightly larger than my existing microwave.The looks are pretty standard, it's not ugly, it's not beautiful, but it is really good at what it does. I've never popped popcorn so perfectliy in my life and I've also never set a bag on fire before. lol Just make sure you punch in the right time before walking away! I've also noticed that cold dishes warm up about 4x faster than my old 1K watt Panasonic and more evenly.So far, i don't use any of the special modes since I never really do anything but warm stuff up but on a whim I did try the defrost on a big block of bacon ends. It performed beautfifully. It defrosted without cooking and it was such a nice surprise that it actually worked!The other part I really like about it (and don't like) is that it's just so darn quiet. I keep yelling at my kids to start the microwave because I literally can't hear it from a few feet away. I thought they just put it in the microwave and left it there like they usually do. Sorry kids... It's actually even quieter than my fridge. It's amazing.The door handle actually opens up the door without any stupid buttons or latches, too. A huge improvement over my panasonice and that dumb button that always breaks.Overall, am I happy with this? I'm beyond happy. I will never go back to Panasonic!Oh, I guess the only real complaint (a minor one) is that the buttons can be a little hard to push sometimes and the clock is unreadable at my height (5'11 if that matters). The top of the numbers are cut off when I'm standing next to it unless I stoop down a little to see the full display.",

                "reviewText": "The only thing we don't like about this microwave is that the numbers and start buttons are not well visible especially in the early morning or.night hours when you might not want to turn on all the overhead kitchen lights. I solved that problem because I am crafty and happened to have white sparkly stick on numbers and symbols which helped make the areas more clearly visible.One feature I love about this microwave is the soften/melt feature. Once you learn the ones you use most often like melting a stick of butter it is super easy. This setting results in NO splatter and no over melting.I also enjoy the sensor reheat option which works very well.I highly recommend this microwave. We have been using it for about 5 months now. It gets daily use in our house.It also has a beautiful white interior along with a bright white LED light that helps when cleaning the interior or observing food.",
