                "reviewText": "Who's ever heard of Comfee before? I'm used to buying from Black & Decker, Panasonic, Toshiba - you know, the usual suspects. But look at the style of this thing. This is what appliances *should* look like, elevate your space! I had the same hesitations as most looking at this probably do:(1) I've never heard of this brand before, it's going to melt and light my building on fire(2) The interface is going to be counter intuitive and impossible to useTo address (1) - the internals of most microwaves are almost identical. I've had zero issues so far. It heats up my food great, and I've noticed no time difference, no dead spots, honestly very little difference compared to other microwaves I've owned/used in the pastTo address (2) - yes the interface *is* a little clunky. But honestly a few minutes with the instruction manual and it's not all that bad. The dial is a little tricky when setting cook time - you turn it one direction first, then turn it back to get it down to the right range (you'll see what I mean) - but I'm almost always using the 30 second button anyway. Also it has the mute setting as a dedicated button which is huge!In terms of size the 0.9 cubic ft SKU fits perfectly in my small kitchen and has plenty of space inside to fit plates and larger tupperware. 0.7 seemed way too small (also in terms of power) so if you have the space for the 0.9 one I'd recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "Fits perfect for the limited space I have. Inside is a little smaller than some 700 watts I've had in the past, however it does still fit a dinner plate. If popping popcorn, until the bag starts to inflate, it stays stationary on the turning plate as the bags are too long for turning. Once inflated it does rotate. It's best to put a silicone mat underneath as it does slide slightly when opening the door handle. Easy to clean. The few quirks are no big deal. It cooks as it's intended for.",

                "reviewText": "I got it on a special deal of the day only paying about $84 for it so I can't complain about the price. It works fine but at 700W I always have to add time for cooking directions as most frozen dishes, or other items are based on using a 1200W Microwave. I don't have to add a lot of time, but say if it says 4 minutes, I leave it in for five etc. It does require more space than you'd think, so be sure you check the specs for safety, one side they ask for a 4 feet clearance, not sure why, I gave it two and it seems to work without any issues. You'll also have to remember NOT to put things on top of it (you should have about a 10\" clearance above it, and at least 3 to 4\" behind it. That worked okay on my counter. I have a very limited income so when my old Sylvania died (after giving me some 23 or so good years), another 700W, I had to find an inexpensive replacement and this was it.There is something that I find annoying. When I want to set it to a certain time, I'm so accustomed to just pressing 150 for 1 minute 50 seconds... but if you try that with this machine, as soon as you hit the one, it will begin a one minute timing no more no less, and you'll have to stop it, and go the longer way. You must push the timer button up top first, when four 0's appear, THEN you can enter you 150, or 430, or whatever not an even minute timing you wish.It has a nice glass revolving tray inside. I use covers for all of my dishes because microwaved items give off a lot of water vapor since it is the water molecules it stimulates. This is what eventually killed my old machine. I didn't realize all that moisture was just sitting on top of the inside of my microwave and eventually it rusted. (Yes, of course I regularly cleaned my microwave; but since it rarely got dirty or showed spillage, there might be a week or more before I'd wipe it down. Now I know that by having fairly inexpensive plastic covers (1 large and one small) they will trap most of the steam on them, and a quick wipe across the top of the inside, should keep it from eating away at the metal surface. Anyway, it's a good buy for the price, it works well. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the MUCH higher priced microwaves--but it does do the job.",

Pues no es azul, realmente es VERDE MENTA. Tuve que devolverlo solo por ese detalle, ojal\u00e1 usaran fotos m\u00e1s exactas a lo que se recibe f\u00edsicamente. Respecto a funcionalidad no tengo opini\u00f3n porque nunca lo us\u00e9 pero fuera del color el horno es muy bonito.",
