You can trust me I\u2019ve done the research.Found that if done 2 eggs in 1 container the yolk cooks way faster than the whites so you end up with a super well done yolk and runny whites. If you do 2 containers with 1 egg in each but put them in at the same time they actually cook slower, if you increase the time to 45 seconds you end up with the above scenario, well done yolk and runny whites.The correct way is 1 at a time 31 seconds \ud83e\udd0c",
