I needed something reasonable in price and smaller since it would be just me and sitting on a counter. This fit the requirements.Seven years later we still use it, its a great microwave, it still works as new and does what it was intended for; heat up food quickly. For those saying its too small, I fit large glass Pyrex bowls, full sized dinner plates etc. in it, what are these people trying to cook in a microwave 15lb turkeys, whole roasts? As long as the width/circumference is the size of a round dinner plate and it fits on the round glass turn table you're good!Its as quiet as any other microwave and it is easy to use. It does take a bit longer to use (seconds) since its less wattage - just be aware, but its not difficult to adjust times.For the price, counter footprint and longevity this is well made and worth buying!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I had the RCA Microwave installed over my range and we discovered that it would not work. The lights, fan, and clock work but when I try to cook food in the microwave it just says \u201cpause\u201d and will not start. I called the RCA helpline on October 4 and they assigned me a case file number. They asked me to send them a copy of my purchase order, a picture of the front of the microwave, and the model and serial number. I submitted the requested information on October 5. Since then I have called them several times and resubmitted the requested material again. Each time, they tell me that someone will get in touch with me as soon as possible. As of November 3, after almost a month since I first contacted them, no one from RCA/Curtis has gotten in touch with me about the microwave oven. Since I paid to have it installed, I really want a repair person to look at it before I have it uninstalled, in case it is a repairable problem. Unfortunately it looks like no one from RCA/Curtis is going to get back to me. I seriously regret buying this microwave.Update 12/27/2017\u2013 I have been trying to get Curtis International (who owns RCA) to honor the warranty on this microwave since October 5,2017. This microwave has NEVER worked. Today I got an email from Curtis telling me how to box up the microwave and how to mail it back to them via USPS and when they get it they will determine if they will replace/repair it. Of course I have to return it at my own expense. I have asked them for a pre-paid shipping label but so far no response on that request. Typically it takes them 2-3 weeks to respond to any email and you cannot contact the warranty people by phone. I have supplied the bill of sale, model number, pictures of the microwave at least four times to them and they always have some excuse for why they are delaying in honoring the warranty. I bought this microwave because there were some glowing reviews but buyer beware! If you get a POS like I did, good luck trying to get them to honor their warranty. I should have returned the microwave to Amazon as soon as we discovered that the cook options will not work but since the fan and lights worked, I hoped it was something simple to repair. And I had already paid someone to install it. I thought that RCA was a trusted name so there shouldn\u2019t be a problem getting a repair/replacement. Was I wrong!!!ANOTHER UPDATE: Since Curtis/RCA wants me to pay for shipping their defective microwave back to them and I am waiting to see if they will send me a pre-paid shipping label (yeah, right), I decided to see if a local microwave repair person could work on this microwave. So far, I have contacted 3 different repair service companies and NONE of them will work on Curtis/RCA microwaves. WOW!FINAL UPDATE . Jan 10, 2018. I refused to pay to ship the defective RCA Microwave to Curtis/RCA. I could not understand why a company would sell defective merchandise and then expect the customer to pay to have the defective microwave shipped to them. Shipping a heavy microwave to Detroit, MI was going to be expensive! I finally found a microwave repairman who said he would try to repair he microwave. When he arrived, he agreed that it was a defective control panel and would have to be replaced. Now here is the kicker: This microwave is proprietary--which means repair companies cannot purchase parts for it. The only way you can get service is to ship it back to Curtis/RCA at customers' expense and HOPE that Curtis/RCA will repair it and send it back. Apparently, Curtis/RCA has been selling defective microwaves over the past several months, based on reviews I have read. DO NOT buy this microwave!!",

While it is the same handy size as the older model, the interior dimensions are smaller, and I can no longer use microwave safe dishes that fit in my earlier microwave. Also, the turntable is very unstable and often jumps off the little wheeled ring which is very flimsy. Being able to just hit one number for a quick heating cycle, the only options are whole and half minutes. At least 2 of the products I use regularly call for a time with a quarter minute.",
