                "reviewText": "My 10-year-old GE microwave oven died and needed to be replaced. I wanted one that was an exact fit as the old one and this model seemed to match. However, the new one did not fit the old mounting bracket, so I had to install the new one that came with the appliance. Also, the holes for the support bolts that screw into the top of the machine were not in the same location as on the old one. So, I also had to drill new holes for those bolts. Overall, it was easy to do, just more time-consuming than I thought it would be. Vendor was great and the machine arrived in good condition by FedEx the day after I ordered it.",
