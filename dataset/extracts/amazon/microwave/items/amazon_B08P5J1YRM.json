                "reviewText": "At first the Galanz microwave seemed cheaply made. Compared to my old Maytag, it's very light weight. But, after using it for a about 4 months, I've come to appreciate how it cooks.I replaced same for same. I had an 1100w Maytag oven and I bought the Galanz 1100w oven. I'd have preferred the larger oven, but didn't have the space.This oven cooks in about 2/3 of the time than the old Maytag, but with very notable differences.The weight defrost does a great job and is very accurate. The Maytag always over heated the outside edges, cooking meats, while leaving the center icy. The Galanz does neither. When defrosting 1 pound of meat, it comes out totally defrosted, with NO cooked areas.The potato setting is also very accurate. I weigh the potato(s) before cooking it/them, entering the total weight in ounces. My husband loves baked potatoes, sometimes eating one for lunch. I've cooked monster sized potatoes and small; every one comes out perfectly cooked (without turning over), never overcooked.I've reheated using the sensor reheat, and everything comes out properly reheated, without a cool center, or over cooked outside. I've sensor cooked certain things and have achieved properly cooked good, without over cooking.I knew from other reviews that the light isn't very bright, but that's inconsequential. The microwave cooks accurately without the requirement to constantly watch.The interior is very easy to clean. Nothing sticks to it.The microwave is a very good buy and every function I've used works perfectly.",

It make it very easy instead of finding the correct button to push for the desired number of seconds I need it to run. I only have one complaint and it may not be a big deal for the average buyer. I am one of those people who would like to see into the microwave as it is cooking and spinning, more of an entertainment feature. The light in the microwave is so dim I actually thought it came without a light till I examined it more closely. It has a very dim light and actually serves no purpose when it is operating and actually only serves a purpose when the door is open and the room is dark.Other than that I could not be happier with the microwave.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this microwave on the 12 of March 2021. It worked fine until a week ago,I was in the kitchen when I heard a strange cracking sound. There I behold the microwave glass shattering before my eyes. It was not in use at the time. My child was also cut by the shattered glass. I still don't understand why I would pay over $150 for a microwave that only last for a year. Clearly it's a manufacturer problem and a damm scam. If you purchase this microwave, of course you're going to feel pleased because of the outer appearance but I am sure that in the short run,just like myself you'll be highly disappointed. This was a total waste of money and I expect the seller to issue me with a full refund. I've reached out to them and no one has responded. This product is a safety hazard. I'm warning you,do not purchase.",

                "reviewText": "This oven is exactly as advertised and works well.The good:Large cavity 17.5\" wide, 10.25\" high, 16.5 to 18\" deep (in various places), 16.5\" turntable. (This information was hard to find so I measured it for the review).Plenty of power (40% more than the oven it replaces)Great control of power level 10% to 100% ten steps.Simple controls -- just twist knob to set time and push to start. Push button then twist knob to set power level, then push knob, then twist again for time and push to start.Built in timer for whatever you like simultaneous with microwave timing.Lots of other functions I don't use.The not so good:The interior is dark colored, and the internal light is weak so it's hard to see what is going on while cooking. They could fix this! The oven it replaced had a light interior and a brighter light so I could observe things like boiling.The instruction manual refers to a button to stop the turntable, but my unit does not seem to have this ability. It would be nice to have.All in all, I'm happy with it. I really like the lack of numeric keypad. twisting the knob is so much easier.Cooking at high power to soften food and boil off excess water, then at lower power to brown yields even browning which was difficult with only two power settings on my old one. Some microwaves reduce power by turning power on and off at fairly long intervals. This one seems to output lower power continuously when set for low power.I would buy it again.",
