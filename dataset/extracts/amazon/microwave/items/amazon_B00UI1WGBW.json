I previously had a full size over the range GE microwave but downsized to this mini version because my kitchen is so tiny now. This one has the exact same key pad which is awesome because I really liked the previous keypad. This is just large enough to fit one dinner plate inside which is good enough because really, all I use a micro for is to cook frozen dinners and heat cold food. I haven\u2019t noticed much difference in how it cooks/heats as I automatically leave it on a little longer to make up for the decreased power. Works good and takes up very little counter space. I saved quite a bit by ordering the \u201cused\u201d version which looks brand new to me. I feel that I did well with this deal and am happy with my new microwave.",

The product description for this microwave says \"optional hanging kit included\" It is not included. The pictures at the bottom of the page include an example of the microwave hanging under a cabinet. In the Q&A, a GE representative says that the microwave is not designed to hang under a cabinet, and that would be dangers. That is not right. There are some places in the top of the microwave to have screws from the bracket screw into the top of the microwave. I have had GE Spacesaver microwaves in the past, and they come with a couple of metal bars to distribute the microwaves weight. (Wholes in the wrong place for this smaller model).the Q&A section does not seem to allow new questions.If I don't hear back from someone in a couple of days, explaining how get the included hanging kit, I will return the microwave.Suggestions on how to correctly ask for help appreciated.",

                "reviewText": "We just got our microwave yesterday. I will update if we have any problems with it in the future.The annoying Beeping can be silenced and once silenced it doesn't make a single beep. This is GREAT.It is a small microwave with a maximized interior space. I don't understand some of the answers in questions on this product. I have plates that measure 10.25\" diameter (Round) and they fit in this microwave just fine. The interior is very similar to our last small microwave, but the exterior is smaller, which is great.It is good for small spaces. Unlike many other small microwaves, it does not require 12\" of clearance above the microwave, so you can set it on a counter underneath a cabinet, or mount it to the cabinet. We set ours on the counter. It requires 1\" clearance in the back and 3\" clearance on either side.It has an incandescent bulb inside, which is good for light sensitive people, and green LED numbers on the front. The numbers do flash if you open the door before the cycle is complete and they continue to flash.I am noise sensitive, so maybe most people won't notice, but this microwave is significantly louder while running than our last microwave. In my book, the lack of beeping and the counter space more than make up for that though.Overall we are really happy with our new microwave.",
