                "reviewText": "Just wanting to let people know that this little microwave, made by COMFEE, is quite nifty for the price. I started out my microwave buying experience spending $400 for a top of the line (or so I thought) microwave, but the shipping experience from Amazon (thru Joe's Appliance) was soooo horrible...as in, microwave came with box mangled (and appliance body bent badly so I refused the shipment and got my money back) that I just decided to get a cheapy. My only problem was it had to have a small footprint to fit on a shelf in my kitchen. Well, the COMFEE brand microwave fit what I needed, and I can still put a full sized dinner plate I to it if need be!!It runs actually pretty quiet, but the door sounds a bit clingy to open and shut (trick is, open while slightly pressing door in and shut door with a light snuggy push instead of slamming it shut). It is small, but looks great and does the trick. I don't microwave much, but still use it about everyday for heating milk for my coffee or reheating leftovers etc. At around $88.99, I splurged and bought the four year Asurion insurance. BTW, Asurion is pretty doggone good to stand behind their word if a product really goes South.So if you need a small little microwave for a small space and you don't try to cook huge meals in it, I have found that so far, it's a really good deal.Much better than the fiasco of trying to get a large high priced appliance to my house, sign for the delivery even though trying to get it delivered when I am actually HOME (I work. You know?) Then dealing with the mangled mess.NOTE: If you see a damaged delivery box you HAVE TO SIGN FOR, do yourself a BIG favor and open the box and check out the product BEFORE you sign for it. Then you can refuse the thing and let the delivery person ship it back. Joes Appliance did get my money back to me a.s.a.p., to be fair.",

I didn't have a need for it before, but started doing low histamine eating and you can't keep left overs in the fridge for very long. Everything needs frozen right away. So needed a small microwave for the times I had left overs and such.This is small and I like that. It will pop a bag of popcorn, but as someone else said it does get stuck and won't fully turn the glass plate around like it's supposed to. But that didn't hurt the popcorn or burn it.It's a decent microwave and really pretty in color and design. I love it.",
