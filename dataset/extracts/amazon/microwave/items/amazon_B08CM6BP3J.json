I use this pot, Mina Shakshuka sauce, and one egg. I microwave it for 2 minutes, add some feta cheese on top, and do it for another 30 seconds. It's amazing.The handle is hollow, so it doesn't get hot (at least with the amount of time I microwave it for), but the lid does get pretty hot, so you'll need a towel or pot holder to remove it.It's also super convenient that I can eat straight out of the pot. When I'm done I put it in the sink and fill it with water (so the stuff doesn't get crusty), and it's very easy to wash when I get home from work, because it doesn't stick.I could not be more pleased. I dislike the taste of eggs by themselves, but sweet breakfasts give me a sugar crash, so I hadn't been eating breakfast for a while. It seems like I'm over stating it, but this lil pot made breakfast possible for me again.100% recommend. I need to try mug cake in it next...",
