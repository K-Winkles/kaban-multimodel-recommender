                "reviewText": "This microwave is huge and has a lot of different buttons, which I was not used to. It has a sensor in it that can detect when your food is done cooking, it is like magic to me. I have been testing out all the different settings and I love the reheat button for leftovers from the fridge. It gets my food just the right temperature. The dinner plate button does really well for heating out food that has gone a little cold. I am also impressed with the beverage button as I like to heat up milk for hot chocolate and it does it right most of the time, I've only had one spill but it was soooo easy to clean up! This microwave is so easy to clean and to keep clean, it still looks just like the day I got it out of the box. It's much quieter than other microwaves I've used. The beeps to tell you it's done however are pretty loud. It will keep beeping to remind you to get your food out. It's a little annoying but I do need the reminder to get up and get my food, and I'm sure you can turn that off if you wanted to. Overall, I am so pleased with this microwave and I have no real complaints.",

One of these days I may actually read the manual and figure out how to do something beside timed cooking and setting the clock, but as for now that's about as far as I've gotten, and it does that exceptionably well. Having bought some cheap microwaves in my day, I would advise against them, as most struggle to last a year under moderate use. You can usually tell quality by the weight, as the junk ones have none. This unit is a nice stout one with some genuine heft, giving one the confidence that it should last quite some time, but only time will tell. To me, it certainly seems a high quality unit, and I am more than happy with it so far.For what it is, what it does, and what it costs: Five StarsI am the Totally Unbiased Reviewer Dude (T.U.R.D.) and that is how I see it.",

                "reviewText": "What drew me to this was the black stainless steel design. All of my appliances I purchased a few years ago are in black stainless steel, but my microwave was a regular stainless steel color and it stood out a bit. It wasn't so much of an issue I was in a hurry to replace it, but knew that I'd be on the lookout for something that would bland in more in my kitchen.When the door to the microwave started sticking, then wouldn't stay closed any more, I started shopping to see what was out there. I was thrilled when about a week later I found this one by GE in a black stainless steel. The only other ones in this color I'd found so far were built-in ones, and I was looking for something free standing, so this was perfect.The size is great. Nice and large, but not massive. I'm able to heat up anything in it and it does a great job with defrosting foods as well. It works very fell and looks great. I'm very pleased with it!",
