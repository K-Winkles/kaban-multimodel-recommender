                "reviewText": "What a cool set of personal popcorn poppers!I prefer to make my own microwave popcorn as opposed to buying the microwave bags of popcorn. For one, it is more expensive. Another thing is that the bags contain oil and other things added to my popcorn that I do not want.I took one of these popcorn poppers (you get four in this deal) and I covered the bottom with popcorn. I put it in my microwave using the popcorn setting, and it perfectly pops my popcorn. No burnt popcorn and no added calories from oil. I can also control the amount of salt that I use. This size of popcorn popper is perfect for a single serving. If you want more, then make another fresh one.Do be careful when removing the popper from the microwave. It does get hot, especially near the tip. Either wait a few minutes or use pot holders to remove the popper from the microwave.As mentioned previously, you get four popcorn poppers, which can collapse for storage. You also get a popcorn scoop and a seasonings shaker that you can fill with your favorite or custom popcorn seasonings.",

                "reviewText": "Review of Microwave Popcorn Maker - Silicone Popcorn BowlWe ordered these microwave popcorn bowls for use during sports events. Always nice to have a snack with TV. The bowls are not large, pretty much a single serving size. There were no instructions, but we found that adding about 1 Tbsp popcorn works well. Zap them for 90 seconds or so (adjust for your microwave) and you\u2019ve got popcorn. You don\u2019t need to add oil, but you may like to so you get a different flavor. Add a little butter and you\u2019re set.They do get very hot so be careful when handling. The collapsible feature is nice, they don\u2019t take up a lot of storage space.The other items are curious. The dredge is nice, but unless you\u2019re using it for popcorn salt, I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s included. The scoop is huge and has nothing to do with popcorn with these bowls. You could use it for another purpose though.Overall, some interesting little popcorn cups, handy, but very hot.",

                "reviewText": "A year or so ago I discovered the miracle that is the silicone microwave popcorn popper, and have been happily making amazing zero-effort popcorn on a regular basis. Then I spotted this set, which includes FOUR silicone popcorn makers, each of which is pretty much the perfect size for an individual serving of popcorn. I took one to work, gave my husband one to take to his office, and we use the other two at home.For anyone who hasn't tried one of these before, they're great. You just put a tablespoon or so of popcorn kernels in the bowl, put the lid on top, and pop in the microwave. You don't even need to use any oil. The result is big, fluffy, crisp popcorn, and barely any unpopped kernels. I sometimes eat it plain, or I'll spritz it with a mix of melted butter or ghee and grapeseed or peanut oil, from one of those oil sprayer bottles, then dust with whichever seasoning mix I've currently got on the go. Sometimes sweet, sometimes savory. This set includes a seasoning shaker, which is useful, plus a scoop.If you enjoy popcorn, I can't recommend these enough.",

But the popcorn cup can't hold even 1/4 pre popped.So, put in less then 1/4 cup, which is not per the scoop and does not correspond to any ring or marking on the cup. Put your salt and bit of oil if that is what you like (our first tests were dry). And pop per microwave popcorn setting. Stop about 20-30 seconds before end (at least on ours).Now, be careful, the cup IS HOTTT, and will be extremely hot for a while. You will want oven mittens to get it out and hold, or pour into another bowl.Collapsing it isn't just push down, you will need to colaps every ring by itself. But when collapsed it is easy to store.

                "reviewText": "This is a great thing to have for movie nights! The silicone canisters pop popcorn in the microwave just perfectly. And having four means everyone gets to have their own popcorn. The scoop is cute if you want to dig into the popcorn. And the toppings duster is super helpful for even distribution of salt and seasonings. I'm very happy with these. They get a lot of use for weekly movie nights and they're going to be used a lot more in the future.",

                "reviewText": "I always thought the microwave bag popcorn was so-so, and the regular pooping corn was better of course but who wants to do that every time you want a little snack? This is the meeting of both worlds. It\u2019s better than pre-bagged microwave popcorn and not QUITE as good as done by hand on stove, but it hits the sweet spot for both. Exactly what I wanted I convenience and delicious popcorn",

                "reviewText": "This kit looks fantastic, 4 silicone poppers that come collapsed and easily pop open. Heavy duty silicone, heavy and thick. But\u2026 collapsing it Bach down was quite the chore. You had to take the time to collapse every ring individually. It came with a very nice seasoning shaker and a scoop - I am guessing for the raw popcorn? But the real problem is it comes with absolutely no directions at all, no QR code on how to use them, nada. I know how to make popcorn on the stove but never have made it in the microwave! How much popcorn? Oil? How long? I think it definitely should have come with at least some rudimentary directions.",
