Followed the instructions and made a big o' bowl of popcorn, and then immediately melted butter to pour over it. Delish!The clean up was also easy, as well as the collapsible silicone product to easily store. I keep using the word 'easy' cuz it is! I like it a lot and see a more home made popcorn in my future.Lastly: I liked the paperwork and story of this company; that compelled me to write up this review.",

Followed the directions exactly and put it in for 3 minutes. Perfect popcorn, no unpopped kernels and no mess. And the compact storage is a plus. Kudos to whomever invented this popper. I will never go back to previous methods.",

Nach ca. vier Minuten war erstklassiges Popcorn fertig.Ab jetzt werden verschiedene Geschmacksrichtungen ausprobiert, brauner Zucker ist karamelliger, Zimt, was auch immer gerade gew\u00fcnscht wird.",
