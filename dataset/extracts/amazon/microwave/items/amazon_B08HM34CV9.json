                "reviewText": "I was skeptical about how well this would make popcorn in the microwave. It seemed too easy to just dump popcorn in, place the lid on, and pop it in the microwave for a few minutes, but it works great! I have an electric air popper that works well but is such a pain to drag out of the cupboard, plug it in, place the bowl just right underneath the shoot, stand by while it pops so the bowl doesn't overflow... (I know - first world problems lol). I heard about these silicone poppers and thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did. It's just so easy to use and once you figure out the amount of time needed for your microwave (mine is about 4 min. using a 1000-watt microwave), all you have to do is hit the time and walk away until it's done. I've also tried spraying the kernels with cooking spray or popcorn oil spray and sprinkle the kernels with a seasoning before placing in the microwave. It works but sometimes it causes the popped corn to burn a little bit. Now I just spray it after it's all popped and then sprinkle the seasoning on. Because popcorn popped without oil doesn't hold salt or seasonings, the popcorn spray or cooking spray keeps the seasoning on the kernels. Makes for tasty but very healthy popcorn versus regular bags of microwave popcorn.",

                "reviewText": "This was suggested by a friend. I ordered one and tried it for myself. It popped great. Just a few unpopped. You have to try it with your microwave to see exactly how long to pop. I then ordered 7 more for my kids and grandkids. One in college and another going next year. My son works away part of year and stays in his travel trailer. It will be perfect for that. Love the way it folds back down and doesn\u2019t take up much room! Another son wanted one to use in his \u201cMan Cave\u201d in his garage. Very useful for small cost. Be sure and save box to keep it in as the receipt is on the box!!!",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for an easier way to make a movie theater tasting popcorn without the hassle of cleaning a pot and I\u2019m happy to report this microwave popcorn bowl works very well! I kept the box to store it in because it\u2019s floppy, but I like the fact it\u2019s collapsible and could be stored in a drawer. It\u2019s dishwasher safe! That\u2019s what really won me over.No oil is needed so this could be used for a healthy snack but here\u2019s my recipe:Melt together 1 Tbsp. Butter flavored coconut oil & 1/2 - 1 tsp. Flavacol seasoning (20-30 seconds in the microwave). Add a heaping 1/4 c. Popping Corn (kernels) to the popcorn popper bowl. Pour oil and Flavacol over kernels and combine well. Follow microwave instructions on the box. I set my timer for 3 minutes but it typically takes 1:50-2:10 in my microwave.Craving satisfied!",

Only a few kernels left in the bowl. I sprayed just a touch of the theater style butter enhancer on , just enough so some salt would stick and it tasted just like any other microwave popcorn. Got about 4&1/2 snack bags of popcorn out of it. Super easy and saves money in the long run.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. My husband and I have been on the hunt for a high quality mechanical popcorn popper. During my research, I discovered this affordable microwaveable popcorn bowl. No way will this work, I thought - This must be a gimmick. So I went straight to You Tube to search videos from people who didn\u2019t appear to be influenced, successfully using all different brands of this bowl. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes! How come I\u2019ve NEVER heard of this?Fast forward and I am now a proud owner of this microwaveable bowl, and the best thing about it is, it WORKS!!! This bowl is compact and fits nicely in my kitchen drawer. I have already recommended this to a friend b/c it\u2019s light weight & would be perfect for her RV. I would also purchase again to make movie themed gift baskets for family members. Before buying this bowl I experimented with a glass bowl. I\u2019ll save you the curiosity by telling you it took 7 minutes to pop and I burnt most of it with many kernels left in the bowl. Hey, I had to TRY! \ud83d\ude1d This silicone popcorn bowl is far more superior and the price is right!\ud83d\udea8 So Many Brands To Choose From \ud83d\udea8It\u2019s important to note, there are MANY different brands on the market and some say you cannot put oil into the bowl while microwaving. The instructions on my box, for this Houseware brand says you can, and this is a BONUS and the main reason why I went with this particular bowl. The popcorn pops right into my butter mixture and salt, and it is AMAZING! We\u2019ve used it almost every single day now and I\u2019m certain my curtains, couch and dog smell like popcorn now - sorry, Boo \ud83d\udc36! \ud83e\udee3\ud83d\ude2bGROWING PAINS\ud83d\ude2bI have to be completely honest though. There were some growing pains with this bowl, mainly b/c my microwave is a jerk sometimes, and yours will most likely be different too. Ignore the negative reviews and experiment with your bowl to get the right time per amount you put in. The times will change depending on the amount. My best advice when starting out is to buy some popcorn in bulk. Make enough for everyone in the house; because once they smell it they will want some too. Start with 2 minutes. Stick with the same amount until you have mastered the time without burning it - and yup - you will likely burn a few batches; I personally burnt 4 batches in total. \ud83e\udd2d And for me, counting 2 seconds between pops is no longer a thing b/c my popcorn was burnt by then. As you microwave your batches of popcorn (over the course of a few days), write down the amount you used, the time, and results; like you\u2019re doing a grade 9 science experiment. Once you make a successful batch, use a post-it note & stick the times to your microwave. Do all of this and you\u2019ll graduate to popcorn connoisseur! \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udd25 If you purchase this bowl and it catches fire, I\u2019m sorry to say, it\u2019s likely your microwave! Speaking from a bad experience at my workplace, some microwaves loathe popcorn.\ud83e\udd2bSecret Tip\ud83e\udd2bPsst! One more thing - during my testing period, I\u2019ve been very successful with putting the leftover kernels that didn\u2019t successfully pop back into the microwave. \ud83e\udd2b However, once you find your perfect time, you won\u2019t have many kernels leftover anyway - so it wouldn\u2019t be worth your time.
