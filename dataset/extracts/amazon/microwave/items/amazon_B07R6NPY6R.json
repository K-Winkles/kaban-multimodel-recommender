He can finally have hot food on his truck (nukeable) and he couldn't be happier.He's had it a month now and nothing but praises still. Will update if that changes, but I doubt it will.Update: 1/19/22:Unfortunately a faulty inverter took the microwave out in June of last year. It really took a beating until then and I have no doubt if the inverter had not fried it,that it would still be working today. Was well worth the money we paid, even though it suffered a cruel and pointless death.RIP microwave. You served us well and you will be missed.",
