Perfect for my home office, keeps everything cold, I mainly use it for drinks, takeout lunch leftovers, and ice. Was used as extra refrigerator. space for Thanksgiving and Christmas not really deep enough for huge casserole dishes or something similar if you take out one or two of the racks a whole turkey could be placed in to thaw. Holds an entire case of soda if the veggie draw is used. It would BE PERFECT for a dorm, an attic bedroom, home office, or for an efficiency/studio apartment.It is decorative and something right out of the \"I Love Lucy\" show. It is a conversation piece and everyone smiles when they see it. I get a lot of \"My Grandma had one almost exactly like that but bigger!\"A great buy and we'll worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly I love it. It\u2019s exactly what I wanted. I wanted to get Red or White, I thought the color scheme would have looked better with my wall color, but those were 100$ more and I\u2019m cheap, so no. I have it on the highest setting and it keeps everything perfectly cold to me. I only use it for beverages (which is why I removed the bottom draw) so I\u2019m not sure how fresh produce will do but it\u2019s definitely keeps it cold. Yes the handles are plastic, but it\u2019s a Mini fridge. What would you expect? It still looks well made to me and not cheap looking by any means. My only issue was this vibrating metal sound it was making. It\u2019s in my bedroom so that was VERY annoying the first few nights but there\u2019s a little spiral coil I taped with electric tape and now silence! I\u2019ll include a picture. So far so good. I expect it to last at least two years. If it doesn\u2019t I will update.Update: Okay, so the highest setting isn\u2019t the best, after a while my drinks started freezing. Even with a full fridge. It took a while but somewhere in between 4 and 5 is a sweet spot. Again, I only store drinks so If you\u2019re storing produce you might want to go lower",

The temperature control can be a little tricky to figure out but I found its best to keep it on the default setting of 4. The freezer works surprisingly well. I have it in my dorm room so it can get annoying when it starts making noise at night but it is dead silent most of the time. For this reason I have to knock off a star. Overall, it is definitely worth it and if your not sleeping with it next to your bed it should have no faults.",

                "reviewText": "We opted for the turquoise fridge. Couldn't be happier with this purchase. It really keeps ice packs cold- we bought this for a second floor to keep ice packs and water in. It was a bit of a challenge getting it up the stairs upright (you cannot tilt refrigerators) but we did manage it. I wish they had wheels on the bottom since we had to push it on thick carpet and it would have made getting it up 14 stairs much easier than lifting one step at at time. The door hangs at bit at the bottom but it does close thoroughly and makes a good seal despite nearly sitting on top of the carpet. As you can see from the pics it has a lot of room for storage. This is QUIET you cannot hear it from five feet away at all and it came up to temp in less than one hour and a bottle of water I put in the freezer as a test was frozen solid in about three hours. Well made, adorable and affordable, very happy with this purchase.",

I was amazed at how spacious it is too. It\u2019s really a lot more than just a mini fridge and even the freezer alone will hold enough meat for at least a few meals.On the downside, when it arrived, there was a huge dent in one of the corners of the box and sure enough, on opening it, there was a crack on the front top corner. Aagghh it had to be the front didn\u2019t it! So I immediately called amazon and was told that, because this is considered a hazardous item, it cannot be returned so I could either keep the fridge with a total refund or keep the fridge and have another one sent out. I was so sad to see such a beautiful thing tarnished that I asked for a second one to be sent but then reconsidered and asked for a full refund instead. No one else has really noticed it without me pointing it out and I\u2019m getting the matching microwave now as well. I\u2019m happy.",
