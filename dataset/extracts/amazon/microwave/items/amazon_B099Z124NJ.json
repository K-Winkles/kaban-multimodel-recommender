                "reviewText": "Efffecto works very well in the microwave - the eggs are really cooked to the egg hardness indicated. However, the outside of the eggfecto is very hot after taking it out of the microwave, even after standing for a few minutes. To open one must touch the top and unscrew it - unfortunately there are no small levers or anything to hold the top on the side which would making it easier to unscrew the hot top - so be careful and watch your fingers",

                "reviewText": "Well I was very excited about the product because I wanted to save myself the time of broiling eggs. However the product was very bad. Firstly the exterior is way to hot after heating the eggs for at least 4 minutes. Second the eggs need as long to be cooked as with broiled water. Third after the first time I used it the eggs started exploding. Lastly the eggs even when not exploding were like gum. Overall, excellent idea for a product but horrible execution and functionality.",

                "reviewText": "I use hot pads to take it out of the microwave. I then quickly put it in the sink and run cold water over it, then remove the cap, run more cold water over the eggs to stop them from cooking more. This also creates eggs after shocking them with cold water, making hard boiled eggs a snap to peal. You get hard boiled eggs in 8 minutes in the microwave. For medium or soft, just opt for less time in the microwave as per the instructions which accompany the unit. By the way, the unit actually steams your eggs as they rest inside the unit over a cup or so of water. With a small pressure relief valve on top of the unit, I've had no explosions in the microwave from excess pressure. This thing is very well designed and a snap to clean.",
