Looks really nice with my other new GE appliances.The turn table can be turned off, which is a plus. The new bacon dish is a little too long and will hit the sides at different points.It is nice to have one above the range instead of on the countertop.They take up too much space and heavy to move to clean under.With in being ventless, when we installed my new cabinets, we were able to remove the vent, which gives me a lot of storage area above the microwave. But I did install tall cabinets which gives me 6 more inches all around the cabinets for storage instead of that empty space that can\u2019t be used.Update10/21/2020, I remodeled my kitchen, new cabinets and appliances. The vent on high, does NOT take in all of the steam from the pots. I am now worried about my new cabinets about the microwave getting damaged from the steam",

                "reviewText": "I received this microwave a day earlier than initially estimated by Amazon, so that was good. I took the old microwave out first thing and then unboxed this new microwave. I cut the template for the under-cabinet holes and installed the back plate. The backplate requires four screws. They only provide two toggle bolts. Luckily, I had extra toggle bolts that I could use to screw down the extra two holes. I used books stacked on the stove to minimize help from my wife who had muscle tension issues and is slowly recovering. Basically I hooke the microwave on the back hooks had my wife build up the books to hold it up. I them fed the plug up the hole in the cabinet. I then cut some wood and used hard cardboard to shim them so they were the thickness of the space under the cabinet. I then drilled a hole so the bolt could go through them into the waiting nut in the top of the microwave. One was too tight and I was unable to use it but by adding books I was able to get the top bolts screwed in I leveled the back plate first and when finished the microwave was level too so that was good. Unfortunately, our cabinets aren't level so we have something like a quarter inch gap on the right side of the microwave top.It works fine and it does come with a pre-installed carbon filter. I finished up by putting the stainless steel oil and grease in (2 of them) on the underside of the microwave. This microwave does not have an internal rack. The glass rotating plate and roller assembly works fine, no problem. We are happy with our purchase. There was no damage to the microwave due to shipping that I could see. I watched youtube videos to get a feel on how to install an over the range microwave and that helped. I did all the work in one evening after work. I hope this lasts for many years as I do not wish to install another one. although it was well within the capabilities of anyone with reasonable physical capabilities. I used a step later, philips head screwdriver, a drill with half inch bit and a 5/8 inch bit for the hole in the cabinet bottom and a small level. I also used a number of books to stack on top of the range to hold the microwave up while i worked on it to finish the install. I hope some of my tips help others do the install. Use a good fairly large phillips screwdriver. It makes the install easier. You likely should buy some extra toggle bolts to keep on hand for things like this. All you need to know is the thickness of your drywall. Mine is 1/2 inch. It's usually the same throughout a house. I guess in some houses it may vary but this is unusual. The likely cases is a different thickness drywall may be used in the basement from the rest of the house as basements can be finished much later than the original house build.",

I bought extra warranty just in case but was not expecting it to breakdown.Just after a month, when I was cooking rice (17 mins continuously), the micrwave started running its vent automatically and will full sound. It didnt allow me to switch it off. Then after a minute, its stopped all together. No display.No sound.I left it alone. And next day, I unplugged and plugged it back and it started working but with low power. What it took 90 secs to heat, it now took more than 2 mins. The power level was in 10 (max). This went on for some weeks and then it would randomly fail to heat at all. Sometimes it would heat with low power - randomly.This microwave is useless.",

                "reviewText": "Was hoping to use my old GE space saver also a JVM hanger and have cabinet holes match but no. Don\u2019t understand some reviews talking about door, noisy etc. - ours is fine - our model end is SK4SS so maybe they changed design. Also hanger is longer than the old one so instead of cutting our tile, I installed 5/16 in plywood behind hanger",
