                "reviewText": "Bought this to replace an old broken micorwave oven. This one has the added WiFi feature to work with the SmartHQ app. Haven't tried the scan to cook feature yet. I could not get WiFi to connect to my home network after trying numerous times. Then I spent about an hour on the phone with the GE Connect Home Support line to finally get WiFi set up. Turned out I had to turn off the security WPA3 on my router for this model to connect to the network. So, if you have trouble setting up WiFi following the instruction, check your router to make sure security WPA3 is not turned on. After getting the microwave to connect to the network, then you can enable WPA3 back again. After that, setting up to work with Alexa was very simple.One negative thing is that the button panel markings are a bit difficult to see.",

                "reviewText": "So, to start things off, I did not buy this microwave for its smart home functionality. I needed a microwave of these specific dimensions to match our GE suite of appliances. There was one hiccup during unboxing in which one of the plastic feet popped off with relative ease just from being moved around on a living room rug. The feet are not very robust and I cannot place a lot of faith in their longevity. Fit and finish on the microwave is fine save for the fact that that door sits about 1/16\" uneven with the rest of the unit with the door closed. Just enough to catch your eye if you're looking for it.I got an itch to try out the wifi functionality and was more than a little let down. I thought the scan to cook functionality would be a neat novelty but was only able to get it to actually read 1 of the multiple barcodes that I tried scanning. In the time that you stand there futzing around with a box of frozen food and your phone out, you could have just punched the time into the microwave. That said, the Alexa integration that this unit supposedly has seems to be a boon to the vision impaired community and I would recommend it based on that.To set up the wifi functionality, you need to download the Smart HQ app to your device and create an account with GE/Haier. After doing so and getting to the home screen of the app, you need to select add a device and select Haier on the brand list. After doing so, select Microwaves from the list. In the meantime, press the wifi connect button on the microwave panel. Follow the prompts and input the ID and password of the microwave, located on the lower right corner of the unit behind the door when prompted. It should find your device and connect it to your home network with little difficulty. You will have to know your network password to do this. I hope this helps someone out.",

Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t seem to warm food all the way through. Almost every time I take something out, it\u2019s still cold on one side or inadequately warmed for the amount of time it was in. It\u2019s a bit frustrating but I\u2019ve come to expect this is how it works, so I know I\u2019m going to have to warm something up a few times to get it to a decent temperature.",

                "reviewText": "Nice idea that's been poorly implemented.I'm using the GE Appliances app on an iPhone. Once I connect the microwave to my WiFi, I can find the microwave with the GE app, but it keeps going online, then offline, then online, etc. Also, the app crashes on a fairly regular basis. When it's online, the screen has a \"bar code\" icon which you can use to tell it to scan a UPC code on a frozen dinner. The scanning process is finicky and it takes a while to successfully scan a code. Only 2 of the 6 products I tried to scan are even supported. Once a supported product is scanned, the iPhone screen displays the cooking instructions with a \"Send\" button. When I hit the send button, all it does is send the initial time and power setting to the microwave - I still have to press start on the microwave. When it came time to \"remove product, stir, and replace product back in microwave\", the app seemed to lose track of where it was and I had to finish the job manually.If the microwave oven loses power, the display shows PF. It seems you have to press the Cancel button to clear that state before the app will work again. Plus, you need to re-enter the microwave's Model Number into the app each time the power fails?!? Actually, it's more often than that. I just tried the +30 second button and it asked for the Mode Number again.I don't think they did a lot of testing back at the lab?P.S. The clock sync feature doesn't work.==========================================UPDATE:I called the provided for technical support - they only handle getting the initial WiFi working. That person forwarded me to the parts department which wasn't helpful. I called back the original number and was told to contact GE Answers with actual non-connectivity issues. The service rep I spoke with at GE Answers didn't have any answers regarding all the issues I mentioned - his response was \"they just came out with these\" (as if to say \"the bugs aren't worked out yet\"). His only answer was that I should call Consumer Relations to get a replacement. I don't think I'm gonna waste more time on this right now.",

Then when I finally did, Alexa app couldn't find the necessary skill to talk to the app for the microwave. Lots of online searching to see if the name changed. Then called Alexa help centre (very helpful), who did much of what I had already done, then confirmed that the skill is not available in Canada. He suggested I call GE to see if there's a workaround. GE Canada was terrible. Nobody understood my problem, and just transferred me to another person. Eventually they trasnferred me to wifi support in the US, where I was told that the skill was not available, that there is no workaround and that I should contact Apple (yes, they said Apple).
