        "description": "With a 0.9-Cubic-Foot capacity, this RCA microwave oven allows for quick and convenient meal preparation. The unit's one-touch auto-cook menu takes the guesswork out of cooking popularly microwaved foods including popcorn, baked potatoes, pizza, beverages, and frozen dinners, while its reheat button makes it easy to warm food items back up again. The microwave's soft-touch electronic control panel also comes with cook-by-weight and defrost-by-weight options, speed defrost that alternates between defrost and stand times for efficient results, a start/stop button, and a reset button to clear all previous settings. Choose from 10 power levels for added versatility and control. Other highlights include a removable glass turntable, a handy digital clock and kitchen timer, child safety-lock protection, and an end-of-cycle audio signal, which helps prevent mugs of reheated tea or coffee from being forgotten about. The glass turntable cleans up easily by hand or in the dishwasher, and the interior and exterior of the appliance can be wiped down with a damp cloth as needed. With 900W of power, this microwave is powerful enough for all your cooking needs. This RCA microwave has a sleek design and would add some flare to any kitchen, dorm or office.",

                "reviewText": "I changed the review to a 4 star because last night I was microwaving baked potatoes in the unit and all of a sudden it quit working. I had bought it only eight months ago. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and it still wasn't working, plus it felt really hot on the right hand side. So I left it unplugged. The next day I called the number to the company and was put on hold. While I waiting to speak to customer service I was looking at the back of the microwave to get the model number I noticed a bit of plastic sticking out on the bottom left hand side. I pulled on it and it starting pulling off the whole side of the unit onward to the top. The plastic had been covering the vents on the left hand side of the microwave! What it was was the plastic they put over the microwave to protect the finish for shipping. But it was put on so perfect you couldn't see it with the naked eye. I waited on hold for over a hour to speak to a representative! That's why my four star review instead of 5. You can say I'm a very patient woman. I explained the situation and he said yes the plastic over the side vents could cause it to overheat. So with the unit unplugged he had me hold the start button down for 40 seconds and I plugged it back in and it worked again just fine! I told him in the instructions it doesn't mention the plastic on the sides and top of the microwave. Only the front. It's put on so perfect you can't see it and it should be mentioned in the booklet for when you're setting it up! Plus they shouldn't put the protective plastic on so good I guess. Anyway it worked for 8 months without full ventilation, that's got to say something about it. Word to the wise. Be sure to look for all the plastic shipping covering and pull it off before setting it up. I mean look for it really, really well!!! Hopefully now it will work much longer. I sure hope so because I think it's a gosh darn cute microwave oven.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Price is right, but only lasted 6 weeks of light use. Amazon contacted the seller and helped start the warranty process. 2 weeks later, I'm still struggling with the factory customer service. They wanted pictures downloaded, a video, sales information, etc. This would not be easy for all people to obtain and upload into an email. After supplying this information the same day it was requested, they wanted me to go back to Amazon again to see if I could return it. Still waiting for the vendor to respond to my email that it was past Amazon's return window. Too difficult a process, even with the low price.",

Fits perfectly on my side kitchen counter and thus far works flawlessly.I have used the Defrost (for my boiled chicken breasts I use in my fur-baby's food) and it thaws beautifully without any cooking of the chicken at all. It Defrosts the chicken breasts and they are as juicy and moist aa when I froze them. My last microwave seemed to cook the food as it defrosted and would dry the chicken out.Reheating is also excellent. Again, your food is \"reheated\" not \"recooked.\" I use this option often.All functions are self explanatory and work as indicated. Easy to clean and sports a nice round digital, illuminated clock.I am very happy with my Curtis International Microwave.",
