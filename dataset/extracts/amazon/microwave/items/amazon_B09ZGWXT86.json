I had to lift up on the door to use the button to open it.I put this new one on a piece of non slip kitchen liner since it's lighter weight so now it doesn't move when I open the door.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this during the last Prime days to upgrade a 20 year old 700 watt microwave. It's bigger, more powerful and has more features than the old one for sure. As some have said, the first column of numbers, 1,4 and 7 are a little hard to push. It seems that the sensor for those are a little off center. I'm learning where they are but got used to fumbling a little quickly.That is really the only thing I have any issues with. I am a basic microwave user. I mostly reheat food. Might cook a baked potato now and then, rarely defrost anything. I saw other reviews complaining that serving trays are too big to move inside the microwave and I have to wonder at the size of serving tray these people are using. I have a few large round plates and they fit and spin just fine.Food heats up nicely and evenly. All the options seem to work. Much quieter than my old one. For me, a winner. Would be 5 stars if I didn't have to press '1' a few times to get those last 15 seconds of reheating done...",

People were not kidding about how ridiculously hard it is to press the buttons on this key pad. What a shame because other then that it's a nice microwave. If you are someone who has trouble with your hands or fingers in anyway this unit would be very hard for you to operate. It's too much trouble to return. So I'll just have to deal with it.",
