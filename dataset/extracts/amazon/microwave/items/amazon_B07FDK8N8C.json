                "reviewText": "She said it pops nearly all the popcorn kernels, if she monitors and times it properly, doesn't burn the popcorn (don't add ANYTHING but popcorn kernels before putting it in the microwave), and it comes out tasting great.ALSO: if you routinely have paper plates in the microwave to catch spills, REMOVE them before using this; they WILL scorch, if not burn.UPDATE: I finally used it myself, and it works so well that I actually wish I liked plain popcorn. This popper makes it so easy to make great popcorn. It stands up well once unfolded (expanded?) and seems well manufactured. I love that it's made of silicone so it can be simply rinsed and left out to dry, as well as collapsed and squished a bit to make it fit in small areas.The handles do get pretty warm while the corn is popping, but not so hot that I needed to protect my fingers before I pull it out of the microwave.",
