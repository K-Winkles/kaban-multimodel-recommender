                "reviewText": "I love this! I bought a 12 lb bag of Snappy's popcorn kernels but it was becoming a pain and a mess to clean up when I would do it in a stovetop pot. I had been eyeing this popcorn maker for a while, wondering if it was going to be worth it.... Let Me Share... it's PERFECT!!! I now make popcorn every night as a snack, no fuss, no mess to clean up, quick easy, SATISFTIED with purchase!!! The only advice I can give, is learn your popcorn to Coconut oil/ butter/ seasonings + TIME Ratio. The first 10 uses I over poured kernels and I got burnt popcorn in the mix. I now learned the ratio I need and I've had yummy fresh popped popcorn EVERY DAY! I am a very happy buyer!",

It is easy to use, we find 2:30 seconds is perfect. It is easy to clean. Can go in the dishwasher but honestly easier to swish it out. Collapses for small storage.",
