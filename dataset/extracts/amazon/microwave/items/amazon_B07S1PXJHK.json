                "reviewText": "We are really enjoying this microwave. Our over stove built in failed on New Year\u2019s Eve. I ordered this red countertop microwave to hold us over until I could have a new one installed. I figured if it wasn\u2019t going to take up counter space, it ought to enhance the look of the kitchen. The family loves it and wants a red over stove microwave now. It is less noisy than our other microwave so I\u2019m not sure what the other reviewers consider too noisy or loud. My main issue is that is has a lower wattage than we are accustomed to so it takes longer to heat up our food. Also, it scratches easily so be gentle with it. So far so good as we have had it a month and it gets used several times a day by our large household.Edited to add: It\u2019s been a year, and we are still happy with our purchase. The microwave is being used several times a day and is still going strong.",

The biggest issue is the noise, it operates loud as you can hear in our video.UPDATE: 13 months later and it is DEAD... was microwaving eggs and smelled something strange, when I opened the microwave the seal was melted/burned.",

                "reviewText": "I love it and it looks so great in my kitchen!! The only thing is it's a pull open model instead of pushing a button to open. So because if the weight distribution, when I would pull it open when it was on the shelf I had my previous microwave on, it kept pulling it partially off the shelf. I moved it to the counter and it would still move everytime I opened it. So I ended up putting some cushioning under it from the packaging and that stopped most of the moving forward. It's powerful. The last microwave I had was 200 watts stringer than this one, but this one cooks better, quicker, and more evenly. Did I mention how good it looks??! Totally worth the price.",

I don't mind. In fact, it seems to cook things better as in, you don't get that \"cold in the middle/piping hot on the outside\" syndrome. But let's say you had a frozen dinner. My last microwave almost overcooked it in 4 mins. This one takes 5-6 mins. That's fine with me but if you are impatient, you'd be better off with a 1200 watt.",

                "reviewText": "The appearance and design aesthetics are great for a retro theme and/or specific color coordination. We purchased this for our in-home office kitchen, along with the matching toaster. The metallic color is rich and vibrant but tactful. The quick program dial is useful and I personally like the circular clock display (I wish it had military 24 hour time as an option, but it does not). The only lacking quality is the ability to turn the sound off, which is quite a common feature now for microwaves at all price levels. It should be standard on a product at this price point and I was close to dropping a star based on that. However, we are so delighted with the overall product we applied 5 stars.",
