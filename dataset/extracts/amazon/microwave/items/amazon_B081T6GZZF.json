                "reviewText": "This affordable Toshiba microwave oven is perfect for my basic needs. It has a 0.9 cubic foot capacity, which is enough to fit a standard dinner plate. It also has 900 watts of power, which is enough to heat food quickly and evenly.One of the best features of this microwave is its six auto-cook menus. These menus allow you to cook a variety of foods with the touch of a button. The menus include popcorn, pizza, frozen dinner, potato, beverage, and reheat. I use the beverage setting nearly every day to heat my tea.Another great feature of this microwave is its mute function. This function is perfect for those who don't want to be bothered by the beeping of the microwave.Unlike my last microwave, the door seems sturdy, and the buttons are flat making it easy to clean.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Nice microwave, easy to use, no serious complanits but maybe a few improvments would be nice.",
                "reviewText": "Got the 1.6 Cu.Ft version. I've read some other reviews that said the clock/timer display was hard to see, ours was very easy to see.There was one review that said the touch buttons were black on black, that's not true as they are a sort of silver'ish grey (like an aluminum color) on black and are easy to see if you are looking straight at them in a well lighted room. When you touch a button the actual touch point is very slightly up and to the left and not in the center of the button where its more intuitive to press. Plus it would be better if the silver'ish grey was white and not silver'ish grey, the 'wording/writing/numbers' for the buttons would stand out better if they were white.So my first suggestion for improvement is that the button press spot be in the center of the button where its more intuitive. However, this being said, its ok after you get used to it but I noticed my senior aged next door neighbor who came over to visit to look at the microwave because she wants to buy a new one, she tried to use it and it wasn't very intuitive for her slightly shaky hands not having a definite intuitive point to aim for.My second suggestion for improvement is that It would be nice if the controls panel buttons were lit. As it is right now even though the control button locations are visible in a well lighted room looking straight at them, in a more dimly lit room or are looking at them off axis (not straight on) they are not as easy to see to older eyes even though still visible if you look more closely and directly at them. Lighting them would help.Contrary to that implied/stated by the advertisement there is not a \"one touch popcorn button as kitchen essential\". To do popcorn without doing a timed cook by entering the cook time manually you use the 'Custom Cook' functions (page EN-25 - EN-26 in my manual in English). The one for popcorn is CC-6, you press the 'Auto Cook' button 6 times. But there is a problem with CC-6, and that is if you look at the manual you will see CC-6 is set up for 3.5 ounces of popcorn and this means if you use the 'mini bags' of popcorn which are about 1.5 ounces and use CC-6 that your popcorn is going to overcook and burn. For the 1.5 ounce 'mini bags' the cook time is 1 minute and 10 seconds and you need to set this manually and can't use a 'Custom Cook' function. I can't find a way to 'program' the 'Custom Cook' settings, and although I have not tried each of these settings with the items shown in the manual (or a comparable weight/portion of something else) to that shown, I suspect that anything outside of that manual listed 'weight/portion' would either over cook or under cook if a 'Custom Cook' setting was used. So my third suggestion for improvement is to allow a user defined 'Custom Cook' function to be programmed in and saved for recall later.Yes, I realize this thing costs ~150.00 + tax... so I don't expect 'super duper luxury' type improvements, and these suggestions I know would be ignored and maybe they could be viewed as sort of nit-pickey in some ways. But if you want a decent microwave this one works well and works as advertised except for that advertised \"one touch popcorn button as kitchen essential\" thing which does not exist.",

                "reviewText": "Cons: Impossible to see in any pictures but there is a heating element in the top of the cooking cavity. This is a feature I was really trying to avoid. Space arrangement was more square than rectangular so unable to use a number of the containers I expected to utilize.That said, I love the stainless steel interior. This is one feature I really wanted. The power level on the microwave function is high enough to cook frozen dinners using the timing for a 1,000 w microwave. Convection has worked well and it browns like a dream. Better keep the directions handy at first. The convection feature is not as intuitive as the Sharp I had previously. The convenience of being able to bake (even if it IS a small amount) without using the large oven and heating up the entire kitchen is wonderful. Great little micro convection for the size and price.Have answered a number of questions concerning this oven and been using it for awhile now.Overall: I love it, Living in Florida I would NOT use a full size oven during the 6 month summer swelter. As a retiree cooking for two and baking occasionally it is ideal. We still have a roast, baked potato or casserole when we want one. No problem of any kind, and Yes the light is on while using the convection settingMay 2, 2021 : UpdateHave now had this for just over 2 1/2 years. About 6 weeks ago the light started to flicker and flash. Since I know this is not user accessible and would be expensive to replace I lived with it until it died after 5 weeks. An hour ago I was baking a frozen casserole on convection (in a cardboard container). Suddenly I started to hear very loud popping noises! Rushed to stop the oven and when I opened it the turntable was in a number of large pieces. Between parts and labor I suspect repair would cost me half the price I paid for the unit originally.I have been using micro convections for 40 years and love them. My first two lasted 18 and 16 years respectively. Though on the small side, this was a great unit until recently. I now hesitate to replace it with another Toshiba. Price would show it cost about $100 a year. I do not buy throw away appliances!March 1, 2023After replacing the turntable over a year ago I became nervous because the light started randomly coming on and flickering. About the same time, I confirmed that the convection temperature no longer was even near accurate. After much research and soul searchingI have replaced this with its (almost) twin. Can't beat the functionality and convenience for the price. Also, as mentioned initially, in the south it allows baking without heating up half the house. Since our power bills have recently gone up 20% and scheduled to increase furthe, the power savings over an electric oven will be considerable.",
