                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars HIGH VISIBILITY, permanent silent mode, analog controls are fantastic",
                "reviewText": "1. FANTASTIC VISIBILITY WHILE COOKING:You can watch the progress of the brightly-illuminated contents through the window. This is the #1 most important feature that I was looking for, especially after limping along for a couple of years with a model that provided zero visibility. It's hard to shop for microwaves with this feature. I don't know why. Ads for products don't mention it, customer reviews don't mention it, and when I asked the question, people launched into explanations about how microwaves require a protective mesh that cuts down on visibility, or gave non-answers like \"I think so but I'm not sure.\" You're not sure? You looked through the window, but you're not sure whether you could see your soup bubbling up and flowing over the edge of the mug? Doesn't anyone else want to catch their cup of tea or bowl of soup before it spills over? No? Just me? OK.Well, for those of you who don't like cleaning up spilled liquids every other day, I'm providing details about visibility. The light inside the machine is very bright, remains lit during the entire cooking operation, and is placed between you and the cooking material so that you can see when the first bubble arises in the liquid or when the butter or chocolate first begins to slump in the melting process. The interior is shiny silver metal, which helps to light up the cooking item even more. The protective mesh is not so thick and dense that it prevents you from seeing these events, as it was in the microwave that this one will replace.There are some caveats to visibility, though. I found that where I placed the machine made a difference to how well I could see inside. I wanted to place my machine on a shelf just level with my eyes, with a bright window behind it, and with a wall-length mirror behind ME. The problem with this setup is that no matter where I stand, my brightly-lit face is reflected in the smooth glass. Meanwhile, the mirror behind me reflects the light from the window behind the machine. However, when I first unboxed the machine, I set it up to test it in a darker place with no backlighting from either direction, on a shelf at waist-height. In this configuration, I could see everything perfectly. I should mention that placement and room lighting did NOT matter to my old microwave that didn't permit visual monitoring of the food; no matter how dark the room, I couldn't see inside it, even though it is equipped with a bright light. In that case, the mesh on the window was the problem (though I can't explain what is different about it).2. SILENCEYou can turn off all the sounds this oven makes. Most microwaves make loud, rude BEEEEEPs for every keypress and then give a long, drawn-out series of beeps to tell you cooking is done. Then if you don't attend to the oven promptly enough, you get the whole series of beeps again until you comply. Since I stand in front of the microwave to do my operations, most of which are 30 seconds or less long, I don't need to be reminded to remove the contents. Normally I just need silence, no alerts or nagging necessary. Turning off the sounds is easy and quick--no reading of the manual for codes or sneaky techniques necessary. Press mute and you are done.And these are quiet chimes, not loud beeps. The ending notification is just a single chime, not a long plaintive series trying to call in you in from the moors. If you prefer to have audible notifications, at least they are more pleasant and less alarming, and you can't hear them several rooms away.SOFT-CLOSE DOOR3. This is a great feature. I don't cook in the middle of the night when others could be disturbed, so the noise of doors opening and closing isn't an issue in my house. But as I mentioned, most of my experiments are with liquids in little shotglasses. I need the liquids to not be sloshed out of the glass due to door slamming; the magnetic self-closing door closes softly and without causing eruptions. I was leery of the pull-handle, which is what my old microwave had, because opening the door also caused sloshing. But this one opens easily enough that this doesn't happen, so I'm happy with it.4. ANALOG CONTROLSIn other words, dials, not number key pads. The default time is set to 30 seconds. A quick twist to the left/counterclockwise reduces the time, to the right increase the time. You don't have to hunt for the right number keys and press them individually. And the dial is instantly responsive just like a real analog dial or a steering wheel on a car, even though the time is selected digitally. (This is as opposed to my LG washing machine, which also has a fake analog dial, but incongruently requires several full twists of the dial to move the selection.) It's so much faster to use a dial for this operation that I'm shocked that keypads have been the standard for so many decades. Sometimes analog is just better, even if it *looks* less high-tech and futuristic. The power dial works similarly; the default power is 100%, which a quick nudge counterclockwise reduces in increments of 10. The screen shows the typical use for each power level, like reheat and melt, which is handy.Since my work day consists of many microwave blasts of 5-8 seconds at a time, I was worried that the time control would not be fine enough for my purposes. But it is. You can run the oven for 1 second if that's what you need. Primo!I haven't done enough experimenting with the pre-programmed buttons to say anything about them, and I haven't set up a custom program. It looks to me like I can only program a single custom program, which is a little disappointing, since I have about 5 primary types of runs that I'd like to have on speed dial, but I'm not sure about that yet. I might also be able to use the presets for my purposes once I become familiar with them. I'll try to remember to check back in here with an update.For now, I'm extremely happy with this machine. It's what all microwaves should be.",

                "reviewText": "My family and I struggled with horrible features of numerous low and high end microwaves.This Breville microwave is the best we have ever had or used. Quiet operating and a smooth close silent door with a proper stainless steel handle. It closes itself after guided gently. Everything is so intuitive. Well lit display. No squinting and guessing.Research the many many other wonderful features yourself. Then just get it! We thank ourselves daily for buying it. Amazing how we humans will settle for less and put up with appliances that do nothing but add frustration to our daily tasks. This is not one of those microwaves.",

                "reviewText": "This is a nice high end microwave. II love the large display and the many user friendly settings. I have found the smart reheat does a great job, just need to be a bit patient and it starts the reheat on a low setting and then ramps up after a bit. I was impressed that it reheats pizza, leftovers, and soups very well without overdoing it where the bread is hard. Some reviewers said the oven doesn't have much power, but I believe it is just the way it is programmed to reheat. If you heat up items manually on high, it performs as well as others of its size.The only other preset feature we have used so far is the smart defrost and it also worked very well. We We aslo love the stainless metal both inside and out. It is easy to clean and it looks sharp and fits in with our kitchen!Overall very satisfied with this purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I've never written a review until now. Please, do yourself a favor and do not buy this microwave (or anything else from Breville for that matter). We loved it the 10 months that it worked. Then it no longer worked, but that was OK because it was still within the Breville warranty period. The only problem is that they don't respond to problem tickets. My case number, R103522182, was opened on 11/16. They say they'll reply within two days. On 11/22 I asked if someone would please respond. I received an email on 11/23 (Thanksgiving Day) asking for a photo with the error message and they said they would reply within two days. It's now been a week with no response.Things break, I get that, but that's why there's a warranty. Except in the case of Breville, it's worthless, as is their \"reply within two days\" promise.It looks like I rented a microwave for 10 months for $400.",

                "reviewText": "Insane, I am on my 4th microwave now! I have tried Toshiba. Panasonic (2 of them) and had to return everyone of them. I think I found just what I needed. This microwave is awesome, very well built, all stainless steel inside and outside, very bright inside LED light, Large lit led dials and pad for easy viewing, which is what I was looking for for months. This was the only one I could find with this option which is REALLY nice. I had to use reader glasses to view the other pads and use a light to see them. Very easy to use with great selections. Cooks and defrosts almost perfect. It costs more but well worth the money. The best one I have ever used!! If you want, there is a video blog on you tube (worth watching) for more information. Oh ya awesome warranty!!",
