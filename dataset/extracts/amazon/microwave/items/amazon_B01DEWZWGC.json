                "reviewText": "I got this microwave in white color because all our appliances in the kitchen are of white color. Finding appliances in white color is becoming harder over the years. We're not willing to replace all our appliances and we're not willing to mix and match. So, we struggle to find the best white ones and compromise on a lot of things.Our previous microwave (Whirlpool) was in a cabinet and had trim kit. That microwave gave a lot of trouble over the years and we finally got tired of getting the repairs done. I temporarily bought a cheap microwave from a local B&M store for interim use until we find a suitable microwave.All our search was unsuccessful. White color, trim should be available, and everything should fit well within the cabinet space. We settled for this Panasonic microwave even though it doesn't come with a trim and it is plain and simple without any modern amenities. I had to add a piece of wood to the cabinet to cover a gaping hole, but at least I didn't have to hire a professional.Positives:+ Large. Quite large in fact.+ Powerful enough. Heats up quite fast due to the inverter technology.+ Inverter technology works well.+ Genius Sensor works very well and cooks vegetables just perfect+ Tiny LED light inside provides a lot of lightNegatives:- Old school. It doesn't even have quick time buttons. if you want 2 minutes, you have to press 2,0,0,start. Even the 30 second quick button requires to press the start button afterwards. The cheap interim microwave was lot more user friendly.- Closing the door make a lot of noise. Very useful if you want to wake up the household in the morning. I found a trick to reduce the noise: keep the door open button pressed while closing the door and release it after closing the door.- No fancy functions offered by newer microwave ovens available in the market- When the heating cycle is completed, it insists on making 5 beeps. Opening the door won't stop that. No way to silence it.We are very happy with this unit because (1) it satisfies most of our needs, (2) reasonably priced, and (3) works very well.",

                "reviewText": "This microwave works extremely well and has a couple pitfalls as well.Pros1) Inverter feature does what is promised. The middle/center of any cooked or reheated foods is as hot as the perimeter almost always. I\u2019m especially impressed with ability this has to accomplish this result with frozen foods.2) I rarely if ever overcook or burn popcorn. The popcorn setting works with a sensor and it does a great job.3) Works well for melting items such as butter. It did take a few tries to figure out best way, though. I now know Power Level 2 and 42 seconds melts two tablespoons of butter perfectly. No exploding.4) Reheat sensor works very well. I tend to forget that I have something in Microwave when I\u2019m working on a meal. This reheat sensor saves the day.5) The auto cook feature for heating soups or making baked potatoes is awesome. Sensor works well so items are usually cooked well. Not over or under done.6) inside is very spacious. Rarely do I have a casserole dish that\u2019s too large to allow the turntable to keep spinning.7) inside is relatively easy to clean. I usually soak some paper towels with dish soap, pop it in the microwave and heat for 30-45 seconds. This really loosens up hard stains. Wipes off easily with this trick.8) The \u201ckeep warm\u201d feature is really the bomb! Forget the need for a fancy schmantsy oven warming drawer. This does the trick just fine!9) Defrost feature is excellent with the inverter technology. I find meats don\u2019t start to cook on the edges or leave the center rock solid, as often as I\u2019d have with a standard microwaveCons:1) The auto cook feature relies on 1-14 and unfortunately this requires you to remember what 1 or 3 or 7 does. Unless you post a list in a cabinet door as I finally did that \u201c5\u201d is for potatoes, etc.2) You really need to prepare yourself for the extra heating power this brings. Don\u2019t recommend keeping Tupperware-type lids sealed on bowls, etc when using this microwave. More than once, we have been scared of all our daylights when a lid explodes off a dish. And that can get messy.3) The exterior door could be made of thicker plastic. I find it to be a tad flimsy but not awful or overtly cheap, either.I hope this review is helpful to those making a purchase decision. While I realize this microwave is less than perfect, for the price paid I\u2019m very satisfied. I also wrote this review after owning this for a while, so I could assuredly say this is a reliable machine, at a great value, for what it promises to do!",

Escog\u00ed este modelo por que era el \u00fanico de tama\u00f1o grande (2.2) que costara menos de $500 d\u00f3lares pero desgraciadamente se nota lo \"econ\u00f3mico\" en los materiales. El WiFi y bluetooth dejan de funcionar cuando se usa el microondas, parece simple pero esto ha dado MUCHOS problemas. Todo el pl\u00e1stico se siente ligero, delgado y fr\u00e1gil. La puerta al cerrarla suena como resortes de cama vieja. La ventana en la puerta tiene pl\u00e1stico y lleg\u00f3 hundido, abollado. Con uso NORMAL se da\u00f1\u00f3 un bot\u00f3n de la superficie. No noto ninguna mejora de desempe\u00f1o en comparaci\u00f3n con mi anterior micro del 2008 (en serio ).",
