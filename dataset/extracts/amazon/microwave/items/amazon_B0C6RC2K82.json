(Thinking back now, I wish I would have checked, my surveillance cameras, so I would actually know, if it was raining, or not when it they dropped it off) but I didn't get home, until 4:00 pm the same day, and of course, the box wasn't covered with a bag or anything. You know because, it was only a little over $100.oo for this microwave, so no need to worry about springing for like a .10 cent garbage bag, if its raining, or looks like it might start to rain, right!! :( I was sure it was ruined, so I was going through the process of returning it, when, a few nights latter, I got to looking at the box, and I noticed though, one of the holes for the handle on the box, there was an internal plastic bag, around the microwave its self. (And I was already having all kinds of issues with, my back, so I really! didn't want to wrestle the thing, into my truck and back to the nearest FedEx store) I was extremely skeptical, weather the microwave was any good or not, considering how saturated the box was. But I thought it would be worth at least trying to see if it was okay, if it could possibly, get me out of having to take it back to FedEx, so I got my brother to get it out and it works great, I really like it. It looked so similar to our old microwave, (Which none of us liked to use, \"us being, my mom, my brother, and my self\") but I really like it, our old one which can't be much more then 3 or 4 years old, the internal light, only came on, while the microwave was running, it wouldn't turn on when you opened the door!! I've never even heard of that!! And you could only set the timer on the old microwave, for a maximum of 59 minutes and 99 seconds. Has anyone ever heard of this? On every microwave I've ever operated, in my lifetime, (and I'm \"43 years old\" but none the wiser\" ;) LOL ) whenever you opened the door, the light inside, automatically turned on, so I assume so you could see, what you were doing, when you were getting, your container, of food situated in your microwave. But any way very happy with the product!! All the things that annoyed me, and my family about the old microwave, wasn't an issue with this one!! 3 Thumbs up!! :) Sorry didn't mean for this review to be so wordy!!",

                "reviewText": "Update August 30. As I am now at the 3 month mark of owning this microwave I figured I would come back and give a quick update. I am just as happy now with this microwave as I was at the time of my original review. I still feel the same way that this microwave is definitely money well spent. My original review is below.I have only had this microwave for about 2 weeks but considering there are currently no reviews for it I decided to go ahead and write one based on what my experience has been so far. After my Panasonic microwave that I only owned for 10 months decided to die without warning and the manufacture not being any help I went looking for a new microwave. The first microwave I came across was highly rated on Amazon and was made by Bella. I almost purchased that microwave but my girlfriend was insistent that The microwave have a pushbutton for the door instead of a pole handle. Because of this I continue to look and came across this one from magic chef. The first thing that I noticed aside from the fact that it had the button my girlfriend was looking for was that it had an identical keypad to the first one that I looked at. Doing a quick browsing of the owners manual for both microwaves I confirmed that the interface was the same and that the magic chef looks to be a slightly bigger version of the Bella microwave. I normally don\u2019t take chances on items with no reviews but since this looks to be almost the same and the other one was rated so highly I purchased it. Fast forward to now and I can honestly say that I am very glad that I took the chance that I did. We have put this microwave through its paces ever since we got it and everything we have asked it to do has come back with great results. One of the biggest things that I have noticed since we switched to the magic chef is how it heats. With our previous Panasonic we would find spots where food would be bubbling and other spots where it would be ice cold. This new microwave definitely does a lot better of a job with providing even heating. We have warmed up everything from lasagna to soup with great success. My girlfriend also fixes eggs in it for breakfast and she said that she is also a lot happier with the newer one than she was with our previous unit. I have so far only found a couple of small quirks that I wish were different. The first that I noticed was with the kitchen timer. Unfortunately you cannot use the kitchen timer and expect to use the microwave at the same time. I know there are other manufacturers who do have this ability so was a bit disappointed to see that this microwave does not. The other quirk is with the display. Considering they had all of the extra space that they do I was surprised to see that they went with a smaller display for the time. Neither one of these issues are dealbreaker\u2019s and I would definitely recommend this microwave. I know this review is early so I will come back and update it if I come across any issues.",

If I HAD to find one negative it would be the sound. Not to loud just an odd buzz instead of a hum. Noise is not a deal breaker . . . Love it !",
