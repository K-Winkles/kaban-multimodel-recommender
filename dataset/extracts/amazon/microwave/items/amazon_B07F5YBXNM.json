                "reviewText": "We got this for our small company lunchroom. Model is 1025F1A.Overall this is the best microwave I've ever used. No rotary platter but heating is more even than any I've used with a rotary platter. That's done with some kind of rotary mechanism in the base to distribute the microwaves. The test I used was to heat up many frozen ciabatta rolls. In a rotary platter microwave, I needed to redistribute the rolls 2-3 times. For this microwave, it was OK just putting them in. Everything else has been even as well. Actually, I'm perplexed as to why consumer microwaves haven't adopted this construction. Inertia? Cost?Well made with solid construction. Easy to clean. Easy to put in larger items such as a whole Costco chicken without worrying about it turning.The fan which others commented about is a \"feature\". Yes, you can be slightly annoyed at the noise of the fan running one minute after cooking is complete. But when multiple people are heating up food, it's rather useful to have the fan exhaust the odors of the previous meal. Also, you won't need to worry about moisture being left inside the microwave after heating certain foods.The shortcut time pushbuttons are perfect for office use. They can also be programmed for restaurant use I guess. We don't do that. Setting lower power is easy and cycles the microwave rather than lowering the power with an \"inverter\". That's fine. It's relatively short cycling, so the food won't know the difference.Last good point: no clock to set! Display is cooking time only.",

                "reviewText": "First, I'd like to make a note about the braille keypad, which I saw nobody talking about for this particular microwave.Originally, I was going to get a commercial Panasonic microwave, until I saw a note about how there was no braille label for the manual time entry key. Being that the description of the keypad on the Panasonic did not match the ones on the microwaves at work, and this one was cheaper at the time anyhow, I went with this one. Glad I did, because there is a braille indication for the key for manual time entry. Note, however, that it is not the word time as you'd expect... it's a bunch of dots all together, in some sort of random shape I can't make out. The rest of the braille are numbers vertically from 1 to 0 (going down); start, which is written in contracted braille; and cancel, also written in contracted braille.Now to one very important note: pay attention to the microwave door. The first one I got does latch when you close it, but it is ever-so-slightly loose when latched shut. I can push on the door and it will move shut a very small fraction of an inch. You can grab on the handle and shake the door a bit when shut. Not enough to open it super easily, you still have to pull open with force, but it's something very important worth noting. It makes me question the quality of the latches, and how long they would last in a work environment. The replacement I had isn't as bad. There is still some play but it's all but unnoticeable. Still not the sturdiest latch system I've seen, but the quality of appliances made nowadays is questionable anyhow.Other than that issue I do like the microwave, it does operate as it should...It cooks food well, and is easy to use. I do really like that they make microwaves with braille keypads so that blind/visually impaired people don't have to rely on any sighted assistance whatsoever in the beginning to mark any of the buttons. But only time will tell how long these will last. Being that it's a commercial-grade appliance (evidently), I'd like to see it last 25-30 years at the very least, but who knows...If you don't see any update on this review, it is still working well.",

                "reviewText": "This is the best meek-ro-wah-vay (oops, I mean microwave) I have ever used. It has a rotating microwave antenna under the bottom, so no need for a rotating plate above the bottom. Power is good, and food is heated evenly. The build quality appears very nice. It is easy to use and easy to assign custom times to the buttons.Assuming you get one that's not damaged in shipping or defective from the factory, and assuming the magnetron will truly stay working for many years, you will like this microwave.Note that the fan turns on automatically anytime the door is opened, and the fan stays on for about a minute every time you are finished heating your items. Even if you only heat something for 5 seconds, the fan stays on for a whole minute when finished. I wish the microwave did not do this, but I think it's an okay tradeoff to accept since this model is so great otherwise and better than so many others.",
