                "reviewText": "Compact, light, easy to clean, not messy at all, it's very cute, only cooks one pack of ramen per use which is fine for me honestly. It's a perfect tool if you're short on time or have nothing else to cook with other than a microwave.I wouldn't recommend leaving it in the microwave for more than 5 minutes honestly, I usually microwave it for 3-4 minutes and let the food sit with the bowl on top for about a minute before trying to eat it. Any ingredients I add are either pre-cut or pre-cooked ahead of time, either over the weekend or early in the morning so that they just get heat up inside the bowl when I microwave them together.It's not super travel friendly if there's food being kept inside of it since there's no lid that locks into place so you can risk spilling food if you're bringing it with you to work or school. I'd recommend having any other ingredients pre-cooked and put inside other secure containers if you want to travel with it instead. That way you can just throw everything in and stick it in the microwave when it's time to eat.It comes with a bowl but I haven't put food in it because it's kind of small, I just eat straight out of the pot and strainer because I'm too lazy to rearrange the food after its been cooked. The utensils are short and cute, but might be a little difficult to use if you're not used to them, and they don't really fit into the rest of the product anywhere so they're difficult to carry around with you if you're bringing them with you to work. But it CAN fit pretty easily into a lunchbox...",

                "reviewText": "It's adorable!I used a ramen for this that had long straight dried noodles that wouldn't fit in the basket as is - so I broke them in half and went from there. Filled water up to the 'ridge' on the inside and microwaved for 4 minutes. The ramen I used is also not exactly designed to be microwaved - but that's also entirely why I wanted to try that specific one.Anyway - 4 minutes left perfectly normal noodles and hot water. I added in my flavoring and I like my noodles a little softer - so popped it back in for another 30 seconds.Like others, I did not use the bowl. The amount of water I added and noodles - I honestly don't think it'd FIT. (But I could have added too MUCH water.) But it did make a nice cover, so I could pop the bowl on top to help it stay hot if I had to walk away for a second (which is exactly what I'm doing as I type this)I didn't particularly see the point of the draining basket if using this for ramen - but just found a fantastic use. Raising it up to get all the noodles that stay at the bottom and are hard to find! Haha!I did use both the chopsticks and the fork. I feel the Chopsticks might be a bit short, so maybe not suited for larger hands. The fork is just a fork.Very nice overall! I've been hankering ramen at work but didn't have any way to cook noodles. I just found my new favorite work container :)",

                "reviewText": "Used it for the first time tonight and just bought a second one! It was so simple to use! I have porcelain bowls for noodle dishes so really just used the bowl as a top for the pot. As others have noted, 3-4 minutes cook time and a minute to sit covered is all it takes for a perfect ramen bowl. I added pre cooked chicken while the noodles were cooking and put all sauces and chives in the porcelain bowl. When the ramen and chicken were ready I simply added to the bowl, stirred and it was really to eat. Having a second one will work perfect for us! We'll be able to prepare one bowl while the other is cooking. We're really excited to explore other noodle dishes in this little cooker!",

                "reviewText": "I got this for myself at work and let me tell you, it has been a game changer for my lunchtime. I can now easily make ramen noodles and even poach an egg (by cracking it on top of the noodles) and I don\u2019t have to worry about it making a mess in the microwave. The smaller bowl creates a lid and keeps everything together. I can also strain the noodles when I don\u2019t want a brothy ramen. I also use the bowl to heat up other foods as well. It\u2019s just super handy",

Includes a straining insert which is handy if you need to drain the noodles before mixing in a stir-fry sauce (as is the case with most Samyang, Ottogi and Paldo ramen/ramyun). The lid doubles as a small soup bowl. The set includes a dual-purpose fork/knife, a spoon and chopsticks made from durable plastic. The bowls are dishwasher-safe; I would hand-wash the utensils, however.Recommended if you're a ramen/ramyun fiend like me.",
