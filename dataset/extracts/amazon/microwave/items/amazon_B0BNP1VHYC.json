                "reviewText": "Sharp Microwaves have been in the family for many years. Many of us have had them last all the way until human error broke them.One made it 10 years and lost to a fork.Another one, a spoon ended it after 8 years.So, I decided to get a Sharp Carrousel for my home. I wanted a high wattage extra large unit. This microwave doesn't disappoint at all.The sensor cook works great. Sensor reheat also works. Defrost worked great on fish and burgers.I'm amazed that you can throw a variety of frozen foods on the same plate and it'll heat them 7/10 times perfectly with sensor cook.Frozen fries came out surprisingly crispy when using the Potateo function. Not like an oven mind you but they had a noticable crunch.One hard to reheat item is left over lasagna. I gave it a shot on senser reheat and the lasagna was heated all the way through without being cripsed on the outside. Perfect.To help you get an idea of the power of this microwave, you can cook two baked potatoes in 8 minutes. That's pretty fast.I've also cooked frozen burgers in this thing in about 7 minutes. It has solid power.One great thing I like is the military clock. This microwave is perfect for those who work nights or are in the military.And judging by the Sharps we've had in the past, it'll last many years. Mine is currently almost a year old. Works like new. The stainless steel finish is easy to clean as well as the inside. Display is very bright.It probably will be for many years.",

Food is heated evenly and efficiently, even a bit better than my old Emerson of the same wattage I'm replacing. No complaints about the noise level or beeps, all standard stuff.I particularly like the appearance - the black and stainless steel front is very sleek and modern, the white LED timer is crisp and easy on the eyes, and all the controls are exactly where I'd expect. I liked it enough to go for this one over more popular competitors.",

                "reviewText": "The ENTIRETY of the top and sides of this microwave oven's outer cabinet is covered by a thin, VERY clingy film of plastic. (Think of it as Super Heavy Duty cling-wrap.)As I was (desperately) attempting to remove the sticker from the top of the cabinet (and failing), I noticed what looked like deep scuff marks on the top of my BRAND NEW microwave oven and, long story short, in trying to wipe them off, I discovered the protective film (that the message on the top sticker clearly points out), and peeled it off (the surface underneath was in flawless condition).A note: the stuff is a BEAR to get off. On the back edges of the cabinet where the screws hold it on, the very edge of the film was tucked under a couple of screw heads. I had to patiently dig it out with my fingernail in order to get the whole thing off in one piece.About the oven: I've installed it, set the clock, and tested the features I'll be using the most, and it performed flawlessly. It's not any louder than the nine year old Panasonic NN-H965WF it's replacing (I got lucky with that one: I didn't have to start slamming it shut until just under a year ago \ud83d\ude06).The inside light does come on when the door is open. (On a competitor's website I read two different responses to a question about this from Sharp representatives who incorrectly stated that it doesn't.)The door opens and closes with just a light touch (thankfully) and the display numbers are slightly larger than those on my old Panasonic. (I also think I like the blue better than the green I'm used to.)I'll be back to edit this review as needed, but for right now it gets 5 stars: the price (from Amazon; I personally shy away from most marketplace retailers) was right, and out of the box it looks perfect and performs marvelously. \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50EDITED 11/29/2021 (to correct some typos \ud83d\ude0b)",
