If one follows the instructions it is easy, especially if you do as it says and wait to tighten down the screws until after you get it assembled! I like that I built it myself with no help.There is only 2 things I would change and that is that the screws are silver and the shelf is black. The second is the little non-slip tubes are too flexible and do not want to stay on. Are those 2 things deal breakers? Absolutely NOT! Both are fixable if I choose to use black nail polish to cover the silver and use some stiffer tubing that I happen to have on hand from medical supplies. Both are easy fixes for a great shelf that gives me more storage space in my super tiny kitchen! My small convection oven sits on top of my microwave and this fit perfectly on top of the microwave and over the oven so that I can store food covers for my microwave, utensils, convection racks and silicone hot pads! Would I buy again? Yes! I just might have one more place that one would work in!Oh and my 2 cutting boards fit perfectly too. Yep, I am very happy with this purchase!",

After assembling the over microwave shelf, it came out quite sturdy. I adjusted the shelves for how I want it to fit with kitchen supplies to have more counter space. I'm quite happy with the product, it was just a bit of a challenge to put it together without accidently damaging it (only cosmetic level). My family loves it as well for having more space without buying a whole new piece of furniture.",

I had to change the way the shelf braces were mounted, but it works fine, and doesn't show (so it could handle the depth of the air fryer).I will likely move the upper top shelf one hole up, 5 stars, but would've been nice if there were more hole covers so it looked complete and pristine. will likely look for something which can do that.",
