                "reviewText": "I allowed myself a couple of months of use before reviewing.This is a fantastic combo microwave/oven/air fryer. The oven and air fryer work beautifully. I also have had no issues with the microwave function either. It's easy to clean out. The soft close is perfect. The noise is barely audible. I have to check every now and then to make sure it's still going (my GFCI outlet randomly trips occasionally and needs to be reset. Something about the crappy building wiring. \ud83d\ude44) My only complaint is the end beep is quite loud even on the lowest setting. Yet, because of the barely audible noise when it's running, I keep the end beep on so that I know when things are done. I have no major complaints. I've made chicken, biscuits, steak, roast, veggies, etc and no issues so far.Before I purchased it I read quite a number of reviews stating it takes longer to heat/cook food. And that's true to some extent but it's not ridiculously so. Adding an additional 30 seconds (1 minute of I want it really piping hot) to reheat a meal. And a few additional minutes to the oven or air fryer. I made biscuits last night and I added an additional 2.5 minutes to the oven time as I wanted them to brown a bit more. Made some air fryer chicken wings and added another 5 minutes. Things cook differently across various appliances, constantly opening the door, the interior size of the appliance, the appliance power and even the environment you're cooking in all play a part in cooking time. You have to learn how to adjust your cooking times accordingly.",

                "reviewText": "More updates. It\u2019s terrible. Overall it\u2019s very disappointing product and we own serval from Breville. First the door feels cheap and plastic like. The soft door close is ok but my last one felt more solid when you opened and closed it. Also the air fryer\u2019s lowest temperature is 400. Somethings I air fry cook at 350-375. I used it on some shrimp that said cook at 375. They came out hard and not good with the Breville. You cannot adjust a lot of the preset menu items. Like popcorn. It only has a setting for a 3.2 oz bag. I have individual bags that are 1.2 oz. So they over cook and burn if you leave them in the full time for the larger bag. The microwave also cooks slower than my previous one. So what use to take me 2 mins to cook now takes 2 mins 30 secs to cook. The bell that tells you when it\u2019s done also only rings once, so you run the risk of not hearing it even if you turn it up. My last one ringed about 4 times in a row and then repeated in about 30 secs. I have not tried the combi cook or convection yet but not hopeful that it will be any better. Also there was no clear description of how many watts the microwave was. Depending on the site I found it ranged from 900-1200. I am more inclined to think it\u2019s like 700 based on the slow cooking time for the microwave. And this is all after just owning it a few days. But it does look cute on my counter. But I don\u2019t recommend it. Over priced for what it does. Tried to make chicken nuggets I. The air fryer. Using I cool these at 375 for 10-12 mins. I tried it at 400 and after 10 mins half frozen. Turned it up to 450 cooled another 10 mins. Hot and soggy. Not crispy like my old air fryer. Overall. Don\u2019t buy. I am wondering if I can return it even without the box.",

                "reviewText": "Since I got this microwave I\u2019ve been using it nonstop! The ease and convenience of it doing multiple functions really shortens the time to make food. I have made potato gratin, steamed veggies, yams and other hard veggies, chicken, salmon, bbq ribs, rice, etc. You do have to get used to the cooking times requires and generally I undercooked the food just a tad and while it stands it finished cooking.Hands down this was faster than the oven and if you are only doing one oven dish this is the way to go.Some reviews complained about the microwave function being lower, and this is true. You need to cook food a little longer to get it super hot but we are talking about 30 secs so it\u2019s really no big deal in my opinion.The combo oven is easy to operate and has useful presets, I use one of the settings daily. I have not used the air fryer function yet so cannot speak to that but I have regularly used the other functions and think they work well.It is pricey but if you need an applicable that shortens your time in the kitchen and gets the job done, this is it! Very happy with my purchase.",
