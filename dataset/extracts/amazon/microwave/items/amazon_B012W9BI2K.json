Works for ramen, rice, noodles, beans and so much more without the mess of water over flowing and then things being crunchy because of that water loss. Zion is perfect and works just as well as the describe! I bring this with me every time I stay at a hotel and I've made 10 different meals out of it. Not to mention obviously making ramen and steam rice super quick and easy. If you have ADHD or any other reason for difficulty eating because of difficulty with food prep, I highly recommend this! I've made full meals in this. Steamed vegetables etc. Love love! Bought one as a gift for family and they loved also! I'm really impressed with the quality and I feel like this is going to last for years! And I absolutely love that it's dishwasher safe, because I don't like having anything that's not. I hand wash all my dishes to get the physical residue off but I really appreciate knowing that the dishwasher sanitizes everything. great for kids and teenagers so that they can make easy mess free quick snacks and meals after school or while parents are at work! Every household should have one!",

I don't know why my review appears for both items. They are not the same.It took me a few tries to figure out the right amount of water and cooking time for my microwave, but now that I have, the rice comes out the same every time. No overcooked, under-cooked or soggy rice. So 5 stars for cooking rice. The only surprise for me has been how messy the cooker is. I never add more than one cup of raw rice -- so well within the capacity of the cooker -- but it boils over every time, leaving a gooey mess in the microwave. Even though I now put paper towels under the pot to catch the overflow, there still is cleanup. This is why I only give the cooker 4 stars. The inside of the microwave also drips with water at the end of the cooking time and has to be mopped out with a towel, but that probably is unavoidable and not a design flaw.",

                "reviewText": "I've been cooking rice in a Zorijushi rice cooker for probably about 25 years now. I usually put it on the fast cooking setting, which takes 35 minutes for white rice. Even though it's pretty fast, sometimes the 35 minutes still annoy me. Very often we have to wait for the rice cooker to finish when everything else is already done. So I started researching microwave rice cookers.I read lots and lots of reviews about these microwave rice cookers and was a bit hesitant to try it. There were many negative reviews that mentioned it leaking all over the microwave and producing rice that wasn't even edible. There were also positive reviews, so I decided to give it a try.I just used it for the first time this evening. I was running late, I'd forgotten to put rice in my cooker, so decided to unpack the microwave cooker that had been sitting in a box for many days and give it a try.I used Jasmine rice. 1 1/2 cup of rice. The instructions said 500ml water, so I did 2 cups and a little splash. I have a 1200 W microwave. The instructions are for 800 W. So I put my microwave on power setting 7 and had it cook for 15 minutes. After that I let it stand for another 5 minutes before opening it.When I opened the microwave, I saw nothing had leaked. Excellent! I then carefully opened the pot and it looked like real cooked rice! I fluffed it up a bit with the included paddle and put it on our dinner table. No need to get emergency rice out of our freezer! The quality of the rice was definitely not bad at all. Maybe slightly on the mushy side, so next time I might leave out the splash of water and do exactly 2 cups and maybe do 14 minutes instead of 15? I don't know yet. I might do a tiny bit of tweaking until I'm totally happy with the consistency. However, the first time trying, I got very edible rice. Oh, cleanup was easy too. So no stars to deduct for that. And I like it that you can wash the rice directly in the colander part of the cooker. So I'm going to give this cooker the full 5 stars.",
