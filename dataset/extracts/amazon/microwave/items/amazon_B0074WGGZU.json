                "reviewText": "For those undeterred by my rating to consider purchasing, allow me to talk about the functionality. This is an average microwave in every regard. It doesn't do anything fancy beyond just varying the cooking times and powers for all settings.A near deal-breaker for my household is the ability to TURN OFF BEEPING, and this microwave DOES NOT let you do that. Every single appliance made these days wants to beep at you, stressing their own importance. My household has noise sensitivity issues. About 5 years ago, microwaves started to appear that let you disable beeping if desired. Then for some reason, this feature has disappeared from so many makes and manufacturers. It is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to find a countertop model that lets you set this now. Luckily I'm a Controls Engineer so I'm no stranger to circuits and wiring and can take care of that, though I certainly prefer not to. Every microwave should let you decide if you want beeps, how many, how loud, and if you want reminder beeps too. Seriously, this isn't hard to program!! OK, </rant> </soapbox>. Despite all that, I did not have much choice but to buy a beeping model.When thawing frozen items, it typically wants you to flip the item over during the process (depending on multiple factors). This causes more beeping and instead of seeing the time remaining, the display sticks on \"TURN\" wanting you to turn it over. I know this is recommended to thaw evenly, but I wish it could have been turned off.Sadly this microwave died at the 7-month point. It works on occasion: it shuts off randomly yet the timer continues to countdown as if it is still operating. The internal light flickers all the time. It also grows so hot on the outside it can barely be touched when this happens. Something is shorting or grounding out, which is a huge safety concern. In shipping, a large dent happened on one of the back corners... the corner opposite of the electronics portion. I've been leery that a fall large enough to cause that, may have caused much more. It seemed to work fine at the time so I didn't bother with trying to return for damage. I guess lesson learned there. I personally will stick with store shopping for my larger appliances now when possible.",

                "reviewText": "I love my GE microwave. When it works- it works great. There is a problem with all of them however. This is my third one in 6 years. The last one lasted 20 months. The problem seems to lie in the door latch. If I set the microwave for 1 minute sometimes it just cuts off 20 seconds into warming. Other times it says close door, and the door is closed. Sometimes it seems as if it is running, but it actually is only making noise. All of this has to do with the door- and the latch. It gets kind of expensive having to replace my microwave every two years. At some point I will have to change brands, I guess. Cause this GE model is not reliable. I have stuck with it because he cooks so well, is so easy to operate, and before it starts to malfunction you just fall in love with it. ( I have always kept my microwave VERY clean. I can only imagine what would happen if kids were using it and getting sticky stuff around that latch. Guess it would last even less time. )",

                "reviewText": "This microwave is a basic device which does its job well. It is priced very competitively and arrived well packed and in perfect condition.My only criticism comes from a keypad which is a little hard to read. We keep our unit though in an under-counter cabinet. If it was on a counter top, there would be no issue.It has adequate power, and heats food evenly and efficiently.",

I love GE microwaves, and while I do prefer the above the stove models, this is a great microwave for the counter top. I would buy it again!",
