                "reviewText": "I am currently on day 2 of owning this thing so, really, consider this a first impressions review.Firstly, the main draw: The flip-up feature. This really is a game changer and was chief amongst my reasons to buy this particular oven. I am happy to report that this feature works very well and gains me back a good amount of countertop space. It fits like a GLOVE flipped away under my wall cabinets. If you have low hanging wall cabinets, however, you'd do well to take a measure before purchasing to ensure you have access to this feature. This is what sets it apart from other products IMO.Secondly: The power cord. Its bad. Specifically, when plugged in, the power cord extends straight out from the wall and I think the manufacturer absolutely, positively should have opted for a low profile plug-in, especially since this is designed to flip-up to stow away. This is a serious negative as you're not able to place this in front of the power socket its plugged into without the front of the oven protruding past the countertop and nearly falling off. If you have a very small kitchen, take a moment to be sure you'll have adequate room.Finally, the real test: Cooking. So far, I have only reheated refrigerated pizza and air-fried some cheese sticks. To that end, this thing is a beast. The controls were easy enough to figure out without needing the manual. It has a great pre-heat feature which only starts running the timer after it gets to temperature, which is FAST. When set to 450F, pre-heating was less than 2 minutes. I was impressed. The food came out exactly as I hoped. They aren't kidding though, watch your food carefully when you first get it. Use the light. It can quickly burn your food if you're not familiar with convection and don't understand the lower cook times.My only other negative is theoretical: Cleaning. I don't think it will be TOO difficult, as the bottom tray is easy to lift out, but if you DON'T clean regularly I can easily see crumbs and debris piling up in the back when the oven is flipped up. I think the solution is probably just being proactive with cleaning it. For the lazy, maybe avoid this one.Overall impressions are very very good and, at the time I'm writing this, I'm not mad at the $170 sale price either. Go, Ninja, Go.",

                "reviewText": "I am thrilled to offer my thoughts on the Ninja SP101 Digital Air Fry Countertop Oven, a kitchen appliance that is truly a game-changer. Its 8-in-1 functionality imbues it with an almost unmatched versatility that has truly revolutionized the dynamics of my kitchen.From the moment I unpacked this sleek and modern kitchen marvel, I was amazed at the thoughtfulness of its design. The Ninja SP101 is more than just an oven; it is an air fryer, toaster, broiler, and dehydrator, all packaged into one incredibly compact and stylish unit. The space-saving flip-up feature for storage adds a whole new level of convenience that is a godsend for those of us with limited counter space.The digital controls on the SP101 are user-friendly and intuitive. It was a breeze to program, even on the first try. The bright, easy-to-read display adds to the overall ease of use, and the pre-set cooking modes took the guesswork out of meal prep. From air frying crispy chicken to dehydrating fruits or baking a perfect pizza, every function performed above and beyond my expectations.But it's not just about the variety of functions - it's also about the quality of the results. The SP101's EvenCrisp Technology is impressive, ensuring perfectly golden-brown finishes and textures that truly \"wow.\" The ability to circulate super-heated air around the food means meals are cooked evenly, quickly, and most importantly, deliciously.The large-capacity cooking area is another plus. It comfortably fits a 13-inch pizza, up to 9 slices of bread, or even an entire chicken. Despite its capacity, the oven preheats in mere minutes - a stark contrast to my traditional oven. And the removable crumb tray and accessible interior make the cleanup process a cinch.One of the highlights of the Ninja SP101 is its commitment to health-conscious cooking. The air frying functionality uses up to 75% less fat than traditional frying methods, offering a healthier alternative to deep-fried cravings without compromising on taste or texture.In conclusion, the Ninja SP101 Digital Air Fry Countertop Oven with 8-in-1 functionality is a stellar performer. It offers remarkable versatility, user-friendly operation, and outstanding results. Whether you're an experienced home chef or a cooking novice, this appliance is set to become an indispensable part of your kitchen. The Ninja SP101 not only meets the promises it makes but indeed, surpasses them. I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone seeking to elevate their cooking experience.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted something that had a larger air frying capacity than what I currently had, but that take up too much counter space and this hit a home run! I decided I didn\u2019t need the flipping feature, and have really enjoyed using the top with the protection of the cutting board to give me back some \u201ccounter space.\u201d It\u2019s actually deeper than I expected too which is nice. Pretty positive a frozen pizza would fit just fine!It heats up quickly, ever feature I have used has worked well. It does take. While to cool down after the fact and do with that the tray would pull out when you opened the door, but that\u2019s trivial. It even cooks some things faster than they would cook in the oven since it\u2019s smaller and heats up faster!Glad I bit the bullet and purchased this!",

Chicken is most and juicy, same as steak. My favourite is grilled pork chops. Nice to be able to cook dinner for my husband and I all together, fast and only one pan to clean. Everything really does taste better. My only regret is waiting as long as I did to purchase this airfryer",

My main purpose I thought was for the airfry but find that I use the griddle more. Although I don\u2019t cook with a lot of oil, it does leak oil when the unit is flipped up. Not a big issue, but make note not to have it stored on something that may stain. I use it everyday, so a great purchase",
