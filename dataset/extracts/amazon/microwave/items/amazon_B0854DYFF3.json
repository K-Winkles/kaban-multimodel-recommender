                "reviewText": "Am quite pleased with this microwave because not only was it small enough to fit our space but it had the copper accents I was wanting for our kitchen! It says \u201crose gold\u201d but it works well to blend in with copper accents. The knobs are indeed \u201cretro\u201d and not the current digital feel. Has worked great!! I thought the price was great as well!!",

                "reviewText": "Great size for my small old fashioned kitchen, I placed it on a unused corner between stove and sink, perfect spot for this microwave. It's easy to use with the preset cooking timers, and turning knob is more convenient for setting up desired time. Round opening handle bar is way easier to use than pull to open microwave. For the noise part it's the same as any other ones.",
