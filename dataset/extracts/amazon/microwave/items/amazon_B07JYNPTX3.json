        "description": "When it comes to everything you expect in a microwave, nothing compares with the defrosting, cooking and reheating capability of the Panasonic NN-SN97JS Countertop/Built-In Cyclonic Wave Microwave Oven with Inverter Technology and Genius Sensor. At every temperature level, Cyclonic Wave circulates heat in precision, ultra-efficient 3D waves for easier, more versatile food preparation--even with denser, more complex food textures. This exceptional 1250-Watt, 2. 2-cubic-foot capacity stainless steel microwave with 16. 5-inch turntable also includes patented Inverter Technology which, unlike traditional microwaves that rely on pulse-on, pulse-off power at lower temperatures, delivers a constant stream of cooking power at every temperature for more evenly cooked meals - edges to centers - every time. With the touch of the Genius Sensor cooking button, this microwave takes guesswork out of creating a great meal by automatically setting power levels and adjusting cooking or defrosting time for added time-saving convenience. The sensor measures the amount of steam produced during cooking and signals the microprocessor to calculate the remaining cooking time at the appropriate power level. A selection of 20 auto cook options enable you to quickly prepare your favorite foods, such as pizza, popcorn, pasta, soup, oatmeal and other dishes. This Panasonic microwave oven externally measures 14\" x 23 7/8\" x 19 7/16\" (H x W x D).",

                "reviewText": "I did a LOT of research on many microwaves before I settled on this Panasonic. Before beginning this process, I really didn't recognize Panasonic as a leading name in kitchen appliances so I was kind of skeptical at first. Afterward, I realized that they were a front-runner when it came to microwaves. Man, I am really, really pleased with my purchase here. This microwave has performed stellar and I'm closing in on one year's use! I love everything about this microwave but there's one feature in particular that takes this appliance over the top for me. The 'Genius Sensing' technology that's built into this microwave that allows that 'Sensor Reheat' button to work so flawlessly is a game-changer! I mean that. This feature allows me to reheat anything that's been already cooked to perfection. No cold spots, no overheated dried-out food, none of that! Food comes out perfectly reheated every time! In comparison, at work we use a Toshiba EM131A5C-BS. Supposedly has the same type of 'Sensor Reheat' button. I can honestly tell you that it does NOT work as dependable, as consistent, or as thorough as my Panasonic at home. Besides everything else, this thing looks fabulous in our new kitchen. The space inside is HUGE! I think I could cook a whole turkey in this thing! And the cleanup is so easy. Overall, I'm smiling from ear to ear with this purchase. If you can find one that's still out there, BUY IT QUICK!!",

                "reviewText": "Built-in microwaves are difficult to find and the one I was replacing was no longer available. I was happy to find this Panasonic with the coordinating frame kit available on Amazon for a reasonable price with fast shipping. Install was fairly simple. I like all of the features of this microwave and I like the nice bright interior light. The clock runs perfectly which I was worried about because I have an oven directly beneath and it that also has a clock and my toaster oven constantly gains time and gets several minutes ahead of the microwave and oven clocks which drives me crazy! I was happy that the microwave clock is accurate and it matches the oven.I'm also happy with the instruction manual, it's thorough and easy to find what you need.Pros:Bright interior lightCooks/heats evenly and quicklySensor reheat works wellLooks niceCons:- I don't that you have to push start after selecting the \"quick 30 sec\" button, my Whirlpool would just start automatically when you pushed the 1 min button and I prefer that- My Whirlpool had a reference for the sensor cook items inside the microwave door. And/or it would list the items on the display as you pressed the sensor cook button to go through the options. This microwave doesn't have anything listed on/in the microwave and only has numbers (1-14) displayed as you press the button, so you need the manual to know which number corresponds to the item you're cooking.- This is for the frame kit, not the microwave: the vents in the frame are large and get dust inside very easily which bothers me because it's very difficult to get the dust out. The openings are sharp so whatever I try to use (paper towel, microfiber cloth, swiffer duster) gets caught and/or shredded and I still don't get all of the dust out.Overall, I'm very happy with this microwave because it looks nice, it was a great price and works great.",

                "reviewText": "I hate the membrane keypads most microwaves use even though as a long time engineer, I've designed a bunch of them into various stuff. They are hard to beat from a cost-performance perspective, but they tend to look tired and tattered after a while and they often are the first thing to fail. Admittedly, the spinner knob scheme this thing uses can be a bit slower to use, but I'm finding it has gotten very natural and quick after some experience with it and it just looks so much classier. As for performance, this thing beats the many others I've purchassed over the years. I often do stupid things in a microwave when working long hours at the office since I have no other way to heat anything there. One thing dumb thing I do is cook scrambled eggs in a small ramiken. I heat them for a minute, mix them up and then give them additional 30 second blasts mixing again each time till they are cooked through. I wasn't sure this thing's cyclonic heating was anything more than a gimmick or one of those marginal features that has so little effect it means almost nothing. But I decided to go for it anyway. Well I'm convinced now that it does heat more evenly than all the other microwaves I've used. In my other microwaves, the eggs cook only at the extreme edges of the ramiken. This thing does better. Although the eggs don't cook through, the cooked area is considerably thicker and less harshly cooked after the first minute. Also, this thing defrosts more evenly than any other I've used. Is the difference massive? No. But I'm satisfied it was worth a few extra bucks. I like it.",

                "reviewText": "This model among highest-rated microwaves. Love the 16\" turntable & cavernous interior--fits my large sear plate and casserole. Sleek design and controls. Works well, heats evenly in my few tests. Speckled \"zolatone\"-like interior finish is dark gray--attractive, but interior light is small so hard to see food when trying to avoid boil-over (oatmeal, melting butter). Oven is lightweight compared to older models of same size. This \"warehouse\" item was advertised as \"like new\" but hidden damage to hinge makes door hang askew, leaving gap & unsafe edges that could easily catch on a potholder or sleeve; plus there's a small but visible side dent. This one goes back; I may buy again but only a fully-new item.",
