So far so good just like my old one. Noice level is low and does an excellent heating up my food.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: 12/26/19 Still waiting on resolution. I contacted Amazon who said that because I had the Asurion protection plan I would have to contact them. Contacted Asurion who told me to cut the cord off the back of the microwave, peel the item sticker off the back, include a letter with a description of the problem and the case number, and mail to Emerson. Emerson would send me a new microwave.Emerson received the cord,etc. on Dec. 11. I have had no response from them. So I contacted Amazon again. They are trying to be helpful but are not listening, or else not understanding. I have repeated the whole story numerous times. Today I received a mailing label to mail the microwave back and they would refund my money. The microwave went to the trash after it had its cord cut off!! I cannot mail it back, as I\u2019ve said many times! I\u2019m frustrated and will give Emerson one more chance today. Will keep you updated, if anyone is interested....Initial review, 3 stars:The oven worked perfectly\u2014it heated correctly, the turntable turned, etc. the problem was with the metal housing. When the oven was in use the housing would rattle loudly. You could make it stop if you pressed against the the side of the oven. But as soon as you\u2019d let go the noise was back. Since I don\u2019t like standing in front of the microwave while it\u2019s in use I elected to return it. I\u2019m currently waiting on a replacement.To sum up: the oven worked fine, the metal housing was faulty.",
