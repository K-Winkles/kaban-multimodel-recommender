                "reviewText": "After my old Samsung microwave finally gave up the ghost after 12 years of faithful service, I wanted to get as close a replacement unit as I could get. This Samsung model was the best match size wise.The price of this model has been fluctuating from ~$140 to ~$220. Track the price and don't pay too much!Although this model is advertized as \"stainless steel\", only the front bezel is stainless steel, the rest of the unit is painted black. The membrane front panel keys require a lot of precision and force to operate.The grill function is somewhat awkward to use and doesn't work consistently. The instruction manual is confusing when explaining the grill function. By trial and error, I discovered that frozen baguettes and pizzas come out wonderful, but chicken nuggets and fish fingers -- not so much.The unit has extra insulation for the grill function. For shorter cooking times, the oven works like a 1000W unit, but longer times, it heats up like a lot more powerful unit. The insulation may also contribute to the fact that microwave is very quiet in operation.All in all, this is a worthy replacement to my departed Samsung. Hopefully it'll last as long as well.",

This Samsung 1..1 Cu Ft Countertop Microwave did NOT appear in any of the lists but don't let that stop you from considering it. Our first one lasted for over 10 years (maybe as much as 13?) and met all of our requirements: can fit a full-size dinner plate, can turn the sound off (no beeping), heats evenly and relatively quickly, fits our counterspace with some room left in front, easy push open door (no handle sticking out taking up precious space), relatively quiet, easy push-button controls (no knobs), intuitive to use. None of the newer recommended counterop models checked all of those boxes. (A lot were bigger and deeper or couldn't turn off the sound.) The ceramic inside cleans easily but the top does have the grilling element which you have to work around. I just microwave a bowl of water with baking soda and then wipe and have never had issues. I would recommend this microwave.",

                "reviewText": "Defective product & worst service!It has been a nightmare dealing with Samsung.Using the Combined function I cooked a slice of pizza. After it was done, there was a hole burnt on the interior door!I bought this a year ago when I thought my microwave is broken. Then I kept using the old and left this one in the closet until a few weeks ago. This was only the third time I use it, and it has a hole burnt on the interior door! I called Amazon, they won't allow the return because it is over 30 days of purchase. Amazon asked me to contact Samsung since it is product defect.I made over 10 phone calls. Each time they either ask me for something or just play games. The first was \"nice.\" She said just give us the serial number and we will take care of it.I called back with the number, the agent said she can't do anything since it has been a year. (Now you ask yourself, why did the first one say there is no problem to take care of it?)It turned out, this is the game they play: one will ask for something, like, a picture, another picture not just the damage, but the whole product, a receipt, another picture.... then after you gave them what they wanted, they never get back to you. If you call again, you start all over: they deny you for anything because it has been a year.One time the agent kept me on the phone for an hour, he kept asking two more minutes, then he said he reviewed all the files, yes, it is product defect, yes he will take care of it... then he said, hello? hello? I can't hear you. Even though I can hear him, and I can also hear a light click that he silenced my line. I can hear my line has no noise, and hear people around him talking.I called back, the agent completely denied everything, I had to start over.At that point, I started to tell them that I will provide this whole story on all media that I can reach, tell people how Samsung treats its customers. The manager finally came to the line, and offered one time service. She gave me the service center number.I called service center, they said they never saw my ticket number.I called Samsung again, they denied again that they ever offered the service.Another rounds of calls, angry exchanges, finally they give me a real ticket number.Then the nightmare of service started.The service man came over, told me he never seen this kind of microwave before and don't know how it works, when he couldn't take the old door down. I sat by the kitchen table and watching him.Next I saw hammer swinging, chisel banging, and finally he got the old door off. The whole time I was embracing myself and saying OMG OMG in my head.He took out the new door, and couldn't put it on. Then I saw smoke, I jumped up, and asked him what's going on. He said he was heating the latch to bend it so he can force it into the new door. The latches (up and the down) were all messed up, with paints chipped off and bent. He got the door in. But it won't open.So, he ordered another new door, and said he will be back.I called Samsung. They know by then that he broke the new door. They say they won't send him back. It will be someone else.I told them, the microwave is sold somewhere for only $134. Are they sure they want to send service men twice plus another new door. I really don't want this microwave. It burns a hole in the door for heating a piece of pizza; it is not safe to use. They can just give me any other microwave. They said they make a note of it and they will call the Care center.They never did.Then the same service man showed up! I told him the latches are bent up and paint chipped, they need to replaced too. He said that is part of the microwave, cannot be replaced. I said, then they need to provide another microwave. He said, ok, just call their ECR department. They will give you a new one because he cannot fix this.You guessed it: ECR said the service man must generate a ticket number for new one.The service man was back for the 3rd time!This time he brought the news that he will fix the microwave and paint the latches.At this point, I realized this is all I will ever get if I don't want to put my life on hold to deal with Samsung. I told him how terrible they played games with me. He said, I know; I hear that all the time.The door is finally replaced. wait for service man back for the 4th time to paint them.What is the logic here? It has to cost a lot to have a service man do a home visit. 4 times! that has to cost a lot more than a new microwave! It is a loss for Samsung, and for me as well! Because I am stuck with a defective microwave that I worry will I eat part of the door when I heat something!",

                "reviewText": "We had bought a smaller and less powerful (900 watt) microwave because our countertop is limited. After checking the dimensions of this Samsung it was only about 1\" wider and more powerful so we ordered this.The door latching mechanism is lighter (easier to open) and the beep sounding when your food/drink is ready isn't as loud, which is a good thing because the old microwave was too loud.The extra 100 watts of power is a noticeable improvement and shortens cooking time. This also has an electrical grilling element in the top, which we haven't used yet but it's nice to have this option.",
