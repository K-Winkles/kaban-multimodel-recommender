                "reviewText": "Purchased this for my son who loves making Ramen noodle soup. He had a bowl that he liked using before, but it just wasn't large enough to hold a whole package of soup, or water often boiled over the sides while cooking, making a mess in the microwave. Problem solved with this handy little ramen bowl cooker! This one is absolutely perfect because he can make a good-sized portion without it boiling over. Plus he loves that if he wants to make larger-sized packages, he can make it in 3 easy minutes, preparing it in one container,so less dishes to wash! This ramen cooker is definitely a must-have for anyone who loves ramen!",

WHEN I TELL YOU..... this bowl is magical and microwaves noodles in a way that makes them taste like they were boiled to perfection! Chefs kiss! I don't know how these bowls do it but they are a kitchen staple for my children. We've never experienced the handles get too hot, and the bowls are super easy to clean. Definitely recommend for anyone who eats pack noodles! Kid friendly, sturdy, and convenient!",

                "reviewText": "These little cookers have been one of the best addition to our kitchen cookware. While some have thought it strange, our boys, 7 & 9, feel so much more independent knowing they can easily cook their own ramen instead of needing help all the time! (and, they do like eating ramen, a lot lol)Easy to clean and use, dishwasher safe. These get used to heat up other types of foods as well and even serve as snack bowls for things like goldfish, chips or candy, we've already bought more and will probably by another set of ramen cookers, or the mac n cheese ones very soon.Only one note to the negative; the handles can get a bit warm, even hot, if you put it on the longest suggested cook time, so make sure to check it out before just reaching in.",
