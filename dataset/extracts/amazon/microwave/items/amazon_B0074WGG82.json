                "reviewText": "One of the few minuses it has is that it slides on the microwave cart when you push the button to open the door, I prefer a handle but few are made that way any more. Will need to get some anti-slip pads for it. Folded a paper towel under the feet for now.It finishes with about 5 beeps, a bit much! One or two is sufficient to alert. I just try to stop it before it reaches zero. If not, it's not major, just slightly annoying.With the instant start on the first 6 digits, you do have to remember to select \"time cook\" before punching in the time you want (often I only want a number of seconds, less than a full minute.) Mostly that's habit from our previous microwave.So nothing major enough to really warrant removing a star, but the slippy feet comes close.Everything is readable, the reminder beep is just one beep at a time, and it doesn't leave it there two minutes before it reminds. I get distracted easily so reminders beeps are great for me.Features are good, controls are logical, not any louder than any typical microwave (who needs a silent kitchen anyway?), works just great. The light does come on any time the door is open, which is great, some brands don't do that anymore. You really need the extra light to see the food in there when it's not at eye level.",

The express feature for heating one minute by pushing \"1,\" two minutes by pushing \"2,\" etc., is very useful. The reheat is also excellent. The only complaint I have yet is that the controls are a little hard to read. Greater contrast with the background would be useful. All in all, a very fine microwave and very easy to set up and use.

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Did not work out of box",
                "reviewText": "Right out of the box, the thing doesn't work. The control panel is lit, I put my inaugural plate of food inside, set it for 5 minutes for time cook on 90 per cent power, hit start and nothing. No light, no turning turntable, no noise, no heat, no power. The time counts down on the control panel as if it's cooking, but the actual microwaving isn't happening. So I went through all the troubleshooting steps, called GE, and am referred to an outside appliance repair company. I hope it is fixable but in looking at the consumer affairs complaints, I'm discouraged. In researching potential problems, it sounds like a problem with the door sensor is the most likely culprit, but really. Brand new? Very disappointing.Fixed under warranty. See the comment below. I'll up it to three stars, subject to it holding up for a few years, as it appears the problem was simply a mistake in assembly at the factory that was easily fixed rather than a parts failure.Scheduling the warranty work was another frustration, as they first gave me the wrong repair service information and got my name entirely wrong. Then the confirmation number I got when I scheduled it was wrong, and the schedule date was wrong. I was contacted by a different repair company a few days later that had received my phone number but they had trouble tracking down the service order themselves to confirm it as a warranty repair because of all the bad info from GE. Once the repair guy came out, he was on time, quickly resolved the issue and there was no problem in regard to the warranty. He did carefully test it to make sure it worked after the fix and it seems to be in operating condition. But he wasn't too impressed with the quality of the oven or the price I paid for it.A further edit now 8 months post purchase. I again had to call for warranty work on this microwave. It started to show signs of dying a few weeks before it stopped heating completely. The heat and fan would shut off after about two minutes into cooktime, while the clock would continue counting down. At first I thought maybe it was just a heat sensor and the food was overheating, but then on retrieval of food lukewarm throughout, it was clear it was just a death gasp. This time, the warranty scheduling went much more smoothly although they seemed to have no record of my previous call, and the serviceman (this time from GE directly, instead of an independent subcontractor appliance guy) demanded the receipt first thing in the door. (I had my invoice available here online on Amazon thank goodness as I couldn't find a shipping receipt.) Like the last time, the problem was apparently an electrical connection. The serviceman replaced a connector, and it's back up and running. But it's clear this is just a very shoddily made product. I have resigned myself to buying a new one the next time it goes out, which based on this track record, will be after the 12 month warranty expires, but probably shortly after that.I would not buy this product again. It has a lot of bells and whistles, and when it works, it's fine, but it's not a quality product for the price. A microwave should have a longer useful life than this one. Two warranty visits within 8 months of purchase is just unacceptable.",
