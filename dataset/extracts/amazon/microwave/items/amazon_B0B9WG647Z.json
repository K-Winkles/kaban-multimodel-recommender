                "reviewText": "We'd been looking for something that works well for steaming veggies in the microwave, and I thought this would be perfect. We also have a large air fryer, so being able to use it both ways is a bonus.For the purposes of this review, we only tested it in the microwave, since that's the main reason we got it.The round silicone insert that sits on the glass bottom has ridges that allow the veggies to sit above the water. I was able to pour 1/4 cup of water in the bottom and it didn't rise above the insert. I added nearly 4 cups of chopped vegetables, put the somewhat floppy lid on, and popped it in the nuker.I took it out to check after about 3 minutes. One thing I noticed immediately was that the lid formed a seal onto the pot; it was concave, sucked downward a bit like a vacuum had formed, which was interesting. Hopefully you can see that in my picture -- it was difficult to get a good angle to clearly show it. My husband likes his veggies crunchier than I do, so I gave him some and put the rest in for a few more minutes. Perfect!The sides of the pot are thick & rigid and didn't sag at all. The bottom is very sturdy with the glass firming it up even more. There are two silicone mini-mitts included that I didn't use with this. The two little \"handles\" on the sides of the pot weren't too hot for me to lift it out of the microwave after the first 3 minutes, though I was careful in case steam escaped. I put a plate under it before cooking, so when it was all the way done I took it out using the plate. The grabby handle thing in the middle of the lid was not hot when I grasped it, although the food was still very hot.We were both very happy with this pot's performance, and at around $16 when I ordered it, it's an excellent value. We had no issues at all and cleanup was a quick breeze. Despite only using it once so far before writing this review, I will gladly recommend it, and hope that it lasts a very long time.",
