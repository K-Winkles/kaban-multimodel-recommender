Timer is way better than other microwaves because it shows the actual time remaining instead of just going back to clock and peeping when the time's up like my other microwave did. Also love that the company logo is not very visible which gives it a more elegant look. All the functions work great as does the turntable. Not noisy. Very pleased.",

Solidly made, full featured, familiar control pad, carousel, and right size, it is an excellent addition to our kitchen. And doing a deep dive on Google, we found out Danby, while a small brand, is highly rated by all groups that test appliances. It's been around long enough to have the bugs worked out. If you are Canadian, you may already know all this, but hopefully Americans will soon discover it.",

It's perfect for my needs and I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I think most manufacturers have shrunk the power on their countertop microwaves inorder to go below 10 Amps, which is the maximum recommended in the US for a shared use 20 amp circuit. This device measured at 13 amps power consumption, and cooks like a microwave oven of yesteryear. It, should, therefore really be used on a dedicated circuit. Over the range models probably go up to 15 or 16 amps, but this give a middle of the road power thats consistent with older designs.",

                "reviewText": "Lets face it Danby is on the lower end of the scale. My 2 year old Danby Mircowave died (yeah...I thought it was a bit too early). So this was meant to be the replacement.Overall, I don't really have any issues with Danby, and do own a few of their products.So here we go...PROs-Good size and looks very nice-easy too use-I really like the 1-6 min instant on feature (instead of having to punch time manually) (the 30sec timer is also a bonus)-power is really good. Heats stuff up a lot faster than the last Danby (almost twice), even though it's the same 1.1 size-function and power is greatCONs-loud, loud, loud - starts up with a huge thud...like as if you kicked it.-rattles, EVERYTHING rattles, everything!!!...zero isolation on the vibrations.-the turn table's gears are rough sounding too....rubbing each other way too hard-If it wasn't for this cheap sounding feel, this microwave would be fine.-but it belongs in a load warehouse, not a home.-bottom line....Danby really cheaped out on this one.So the final verdict. It's returned and bought the Panasonic instead.The difference is like getting into a Bently from a 40 year-old rusted Civic.Panasonic does it right. Sure it was $60 more, but you get what you pay far.Sorry Danby you just fell into sub levels on my personal scale!",

More noise than one would expect.I do have to wonder how much lifespan this device has. For whatever reason, all microwaves tend to lose power over the years. Being as this one is starting slightly weaker than it probably should be, I have to wonder how it will work 5 years from now.However, it's cost to function is pretty good.",
