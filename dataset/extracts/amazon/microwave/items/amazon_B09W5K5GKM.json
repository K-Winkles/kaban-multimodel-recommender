Not plain, anyway.I wanted to buy a bag of popping corn but couldn't find a corn-popper.My husband doesn't like popcorn and the big micro bags are too big - I'd eat the whole thing.I found these on 'mazon and ordered them. I thought I was getting one but you get two.My micro is over the stove and is 7\" tall, so these are just the right size.To use them, pour 1-1/2 tablespoons of dry kernels into the bottom of the cup.It makes about 2 cups of popcorn - just right for ME.Fold the flaps together and fit the small slots together so it stays closed.Micro for 2 minutes, open, pour into a bowl, salt, and dig in.Warning: these cups get pretty hot, so keep a pot-holder or dish-rag handy.When they've cooled off, rinse, air dry, and toss into the cupboard.I don't like buttery popcorn, so I haven't tried to use oil in them. I don't know what would happen if I did.Easy-peasy.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered these popcorn popper containers to use in our RV and they are perfect for us. You simply put into the container a tablespoon or so of popcorn kernels, close the lid-which has 2 slits that lock it closed-and put in the microwave. I set mine on the popcorn setting and just listened for it to slow down popping. It popped almost every kernel as you can see in the pictures. I used Orville Redenbacher popcorn, don\u2019t know if that makes a difference, and at the end of popping, the top had opened and a few pieces of popcorn had popped out. Very few and maybe I put too much in to begin with. I will try it again with a little less to see if it still happens. The other thing to know is that these containers do get very hot while popping corn! You will need to let them cool for a minute or so before taking it out of the microwave or use a potholder to take them out. They make the perfect amount of popcorn for one and the containers are a convenient size to hold while eating it. Just add your favorite toppings and your all set. I think we will use them a lot and think anyone, especially anyone who wants a single serving of popcorn, would love to have these.",

Perfect size for several children to share, or one serving. Great for home, but especially good to pop corn at work. No oil or butter or other chemicals. We keep my two going all the time. Plan to give as Christmas gifts.",
