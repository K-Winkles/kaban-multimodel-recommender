                "reviewText": "I have always used an air popper to try to keep my popcorn snacks a little healthier. Most of the time it comes out tasting like cardboard but it is healthier! I had several people recommend this so I decided to try it. It is awesome! I have not tried it using oil. I put the kernels in to the appropriate line and add a little spray butter. I fill it to just above the first line and it pops a full bowl of popcorn. I usually set the microwave for 4 minutes and then stop it when the popping has almost stopped. Leaving it on for too long burns the popcorn. Be sure to put the lid on loosely so it can rise up with the popcorn. Cleans up super easy and folds relatively flat for easy storage. Great for a quick and healthy snack!",

                "reviewText": "This popcorn popper is so easy to use! It also washes wonderfully in the dishwasher. I use the Dutchman butter oil (that I purchased on amazon) and Orville R popcorn kernels. One thing that I have noticed that will cause the kernels to NOT pop successfully is if I actually mix the oil & kernels in bottom before popping. For some reason the amount of unpopped kernels if they are mixed with the oil will increase greatly . So I pour a bit of oil in the bottom of the bowl and then pour kernels on top and don't mix. Simply place the top on the bowl and place in microwave. This is definitely better popcorn than the microwave bags. I recommend this popper!",

                "reviewText": "I thought that I wrote a review for this, but I couldn't find it. This is by far the best popcorn popper ever invented. I tried the glass ones, and they are plain terrible and always leave a huge amount of kernels unpopped. I bought the teal color silicone popper. It's such a nice color. I have a 700 Watt microwave that is 13 years old, and I just put the popcorn in for 4 minutes and then listen to the sound. Once the popcorn stops popping, I take it out before it starts to burn. Usually, it takes around 3 minutes for all the popcorn to pop, but the time varies so that's why I just put it in 4 minutes and stop it early. Unlike the glass popcorn poppers, you don't have a small opening to reach in and grab popcorn to eat. You don't have to transfer the popcorn to a bowl. You don't have to worry about glass being hot or glass accidentally shattering. The silicone is a lot lighter than the glass. It's way easier and quicker to clean. I really can't think of anything bad about this popper. It's perfect. I did burn one popcorn once inside and it left a burn mark that I couldn't fully remove, but that doesn't bother me. So don't leave your popcorn in the microwave too long. It's not that hard to check on it after three minutes and take it out when it is done popping. The lid is a clear plastic and it discolors easily and I often see beads of sweat or something on it after I am done popping. I think maybe the lid is the weakest part of this popper. I hope it's BPA free or whatever and I think they could make a better looking lid. But even if they didn't, I freaking love this popper!",

The first time I used it I followed the instructions to use the popcorn setting on my microwave. It worked well, but stopped while the kernels were still in the crazy popping stage and I had to add more time. The next time, I just set the dial to high and waited until there were 3-4 seconds between pops. Easy peasy. I didn't use any oil, and the popcorn turned out delicious. I was glad I could control how much (or little) butter and salt to add. The popper cleans easily and because it collapses, it takes up very little room in the cupboard. I'm very happy with this purchase.",

They are really puffy and crunchy. I don\u2019t put oil so there is minimal cleaning as well. Add a bit of salt and you are good to go. Just make sure folloe the instructions on the leaflet so you don\u2019t put more than what\u2019s recommended otherwise they won\u2019t pop fully.I bought high quality organic kernels and I only had 2-3 unpopped one in each batch.Still it comes much more cheaper than a bag of high quality chips.Highly recommended for anyone looking for a fuss free healthy snack.",
