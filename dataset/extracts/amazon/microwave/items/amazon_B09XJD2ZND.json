                "reviewText": "This microwave was easy enough to install. I did it with the help of my 95lb wife. People who gave it a bad review most likely do not have it level. One reviewer says their door is crooked, most certainly, the microwave is cooked on the wall and causing the door to look funny. Vent hood works great. Microwave cooks food wonderfully. I like that the lights on the bottom are on each end of the microwave vs both lights being centered like my sisters. If you don't have a drill and some kind of saw to cut the hole in the bottom of your cabinet for it to vent up and out or vent out your wall, then don't attempt to install yourself. If you are NOT handy, don't attempt to install yourself. The instructions are LONG and DETAILED. You can't skip through, or you'll have to take it off the wall and put it back on like I did, because you have to take apart a piece on the top/back for the microwave to vent the direction you intend (out the front in your face is how it comes out of box, I had to spin for the vent to blow out of the top, you also have to spin off you want it to blow out the back and through a vent in your wall).",

I went online to try to find another white microwave. This is the only white one I could find. B & D has an excellent reputation so I wasn\u2019t worried about purchasing it. However, in comparison with my old Kenmore, the door feels flimsy and the down lights are not as bright, but it does an excellent job of heating food and that\u2019s why I like it. It\u2019s cheaper to buy than most microwaves listed. I\u2019m definitely glad I bought it.",

                "reviewText": "... for the price, this is junk ... the door closes very loudly, almost like its being slammed. The exhaust fan is very weak. If youre cooking under the microwave, the door window fogs up bwteen the panes and cannot be wiped off, you must wait for it to dissipate on its own. The door didnt line up properly, and kind of tilts downward towards the handle, and if its lifted to line up, the microwave turns on all by itself. Just more proof that the products made now-a-days are just junk ... overall, this microwave feels more like a kiddie toy than a 300+ dollar kitchen utilitity.",
