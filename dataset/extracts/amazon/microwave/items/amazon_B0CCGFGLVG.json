Cooks and defrosts evenly, better than more expensive units we've owned. It's smaller, but easily holds a dinner plate or casserole for reheating. Even my husband, who doesn't like anything that requires him to be an engineer to use, loves it! Highly recommend!!",

It fits a dinner plate perfectly, and it heats very quickly and evenly. It\u2019s not a countertop hog. Also, it\u2019s quiet! The microwave we replaced sounded like jets were warming up in the kitchen. This one has a quiet hum you can barely hear from the next room. So far, it\u2019s perfect.",

The only thing I don't like is it is noisy when running, and especially noisy when you open and close the door. It has a tinny sound. I would rather pay a little more and have a better quality product. I had one, but it was too big for what I use it for so I decided to buy this one.",

I don't make family sized meals, so this is perfect for what I need. Very easy to keep clean. I wipe it out after each use. I haven't had it long but would highly recommend it for simple use, so far.",

I\u2019d like to warn others who go by the reviews, for some reason they have lumped different models of these Chefman Microwaves into the same category, the 0.7, along with the 1.0 and the model that uses a \u2018MicroCrisp\u2019 feature as well ( a 1.0). The 0.9 seems to have the best reviews but unless you are really paying attention it will seem as though they all apply to the 0.9. This can be quite misleading and confusing. Anyhow, hoping this model, the 0.9 will work for a long time to come.",

                "reviewText": "This is the first microwave I can truly say I love. The clock light isn't so bright it lights up the room and the mute allows you to not have to hear the beeps. It also has a childproof lock. The small profile is great for small spaces or countertops where you don't have a lot of room. It's a nice looking microwave and I'm glad I chose this one. I had a terrible experience with the Farberware microwave and their customer service so I'm hoping this one lasts longer",
