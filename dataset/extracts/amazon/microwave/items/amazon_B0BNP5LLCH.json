Push the button on the front, it slides back to the wall before opening.Why? The spring pressure required to open this microwave is greater than the weight of the microwave.Could they have put on grippy rubber feet? Yes, but they didn't.Could they have made the opening lever push down rather than in? yes, but they didn't.It slides all over the place.Not to mention (ok, I am) the sound. it's really really loud, and there's no way to turn it off.Contacted Sharp, told them about this, what do they do? Not a damn thing.Don't buy this POS,It's just a complete design flaw.",
