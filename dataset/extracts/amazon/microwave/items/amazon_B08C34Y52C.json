The frig that goes in the hole is taller than typical. Finally, this one looked like a fit. We didn't find an off-shelf assembled unit. I offered to build one from scratch months ago, and my wife said no. Admittedly, I have a significant backlog of partially complete house jobs.First, I hate assembling this stuff. It's easy. I've put dozens together over the years and three this year. This one takes a bit over an hour from box to finish. Too much time is spent understanding the instructions.The instructions here are pretty good. All the holes were drilled. It came with all the parts. That hasn't happened in the last 3 I've moaningly put together and needed to DIY elements. I've done enough to be sure I don't like putting them together.Anyway, it's finished now. It's sturdy. It's what I would have expected. It's suitable for a few years when we'll decide on something else.Comparably good kit. All good!",

That would not look nice in my bedroom. This unit looks so much better.It is taller than I would like but I'll take this over those metal stands.It arrived quickly, no scratches or dents, nothing missing. My sons put this together while I was at work. Might have taken them about an hour or less to put together but, I'm not sure.I am quite pleased with this unit. I now have proper storage for the mini fridge items and other things I used to stack on it.",

I didn't want it to look like it belonged in a dorm, so I put a door on it and covered the top with peel & stick paper. It looks totally different from the original cabinet. It's wobbly until you put the back on it. Now it's very sturdy.",
