                "reviewText": "I use these for ramen noodles instead of the \u201cramen cookers\u201d, because the ramen cookers are too shallow. The water tends to overflow in the microwave and make a mess if you fill water to the line in those. The \u201cmac cookers\u201d are perfect though! Deep enough to contain the water as it heats and cooks, and works every time to cook ramen completely at 3 minutes if you fill the water to the line. You can adjust water level as needed for your taste prior to mixing in the flavor packet. Sometimes I want more broth, sometimes I want more noodles. I not used these for easy Mac yet\u2026 but I am pretty sure they would be great for that too. Dishwasher safe and easy to clean. I have 4 of these for when my kids beg for ramen (and then I also crave a package to eat with them). This would be a great gift for a ramen lover.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this for my 17 year old daughter because she makes macaroni and cheese so much that I think she's eventually going to turn into mac and cheese lol. She said that this is super simple to use and super easy to clean and she doesn't have to put much effort into it lol. The size is perfect and you can fit a whole box of macaroni and cheese in there and it cooks really fast.",
