                "reviewText": "A change of color was the reason to buy this set of King bed sheets (set). Been hooked on Microfiber bedding for several years after going to them from the high thread count of all cotton sheets. Found microfiber are softer and even though the top sheet feels half the weight of a long thread cotton, they are surprisingly warm in a cool/cold room.Last several sheet sets were Mellanni. Haven't had a single problem with them, but couldn't find a gray color in Mellanni brand so decided to try these UTOPIA brand sheets. Sprung for the Paisley (to be different from all the solid color sets). Got them in and washed. Just put on the bed, and am actually extremely surprised --- these didn't wrinkle at all !The fit is probably as good (if not slightly better) than the Mellanni brand (IMO). I can \"for sure\" tell you these do not wrinkle like the other brands. The gray is a very pretty gray, (however it doesn't look as good in this room as I envisioned when ordered), and the paisley actually looks very elegant and pricy. Hard to believe these are selling for less than 17 on \"A\". Guess the 53k reviews and the 4.5 of 5 stars, was good indication from others also. Longevity after several washings will reveal the true value. Will re-rate if they go bad in the next several months.... otherwise, great set of sheets for minimal amount of money.",

                "reviewText": "I love how soft this sheet set is. I also love the stripes...because I have difficulty figuring out which corner of the sheet goes on the long or the short side. Imagine: You get your sheet on the two short corners, then get behind your bed (possibly pushing it out from the wall) only to find that you put your sheet on the wrong way. You pull it off, and then flip it around, put it back on and find....you've done it again!But seriously, it's REALLY comfortable. When I bought my other sheet sets, it was back in the early '10s and I preferred high thread count Egyptian cotton. They probably weren't high thread count Egyptian cotton, but they were soft. And expensive. And this sheet set was well priced and just as soft and comfortable. When I put it on my bed, I took a picture to show it off and it was pretty wrinkly, so I don't know if it's really \"wrinkle-free\" or if I left it in my dryer too long. Or dried it improperly. I think I used medium heat and you're not supposed to do that. Oops. I have no idea if it's stain resistant, as I haven't purposely spilled anything in my bed yet.Overall, if you need a sheet set you should definitely get this one.",
