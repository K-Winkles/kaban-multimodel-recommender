Fortunately I got a refund from EBay though the seller did not communicate with me about the issue. This comforter also had complimentary sheets and pillow cases and was $20 cheaper than the same one I\u2019d seen on EBay that never came.",

The microfiber is incredibly soft.",

They were all vacuum packed so the comforter was super flat. I shook it out and left it to fluff up overnight. I went to spread it out and look at it this morning and realized that there's small tears in it with small bits of white stuffing coming out. 1/10 due to damage.",
