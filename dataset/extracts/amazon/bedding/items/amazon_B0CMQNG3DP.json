                "reviewText": "The color of this set is very pretty and I like the design overall. It is quite thin so I would categorize this as a summer comforter. According to the listing photos the backside was supposed to be cotton while the outer layer was supposed to be polyester. However, the comforter I received said it was 100% polyester, which is not particularly breathable. It has a very relaxed look about it and even after drying to fluff it up it still looked wrinkled. If you prefer a crisp look or are looking for something breathable I would pass on this set. However, if you are looking for a reasonable priced set in a pretty color this may work for you. I am using it in my guest bedroom so it can be layered with other blankets.",

                "reviewText": "This is by far the best comforter we have used.The microfiber material is silky soft, with just the right amount of polyester fiber fill to provide warmth and comfort without too much weight or bulk.The fiberfill in this comforter has several advantages over down or loose fills, first it is hyperallergic, so no worries about allergies or asthma, second, it does not bunch up or lose its shape like down or loose fills, even when hanging over the sides of the bed. We found this to be a huge advantage, which provides better insulation and comfort, without the need to redistribute the down every morning.The 100% polyester microfiber cloth feels wonderful. The sensation is somewhere between silk and flannel, smoother than flannel, but not cold like silk, it is very soft, warm and cozy.The comforter has a tufted herringbone pattern on top with a smooth fabric on the bottom. We found the weight to be perfect for cool winter nights. We set our heat low at night and were able to eliminate two blankets by replacing our old comforter with this one.To be honest, based on the price, we did not expect this set to be as good as it is, especially when compared to what our down comforter cost. We have nothing but praise for this set. It is an exceptional value.",
