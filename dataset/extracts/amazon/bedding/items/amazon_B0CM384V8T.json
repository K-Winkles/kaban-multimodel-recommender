                "reviewText": "The Comfort Spaces Cream Queen Comforter Set has transformed my bedroom into a luxurious haven of comfort and farmhouse elegance. The pintuck pleated design adds a touch of sophistication, giving the bedding a timeless and classic look.The lightweight, all-season comforter provides the perfect balance of warmth without feeling too heavy. The pre-washed microfiber material feels incredibly soft and comfortable against the skin. The set includes shams that complete the overall aesthetic, creating a cohesive and inviting atmosphere.I am genuinely impressed with the quality and attention to detail in this bedding set. It's not just a comforter; it's a statement piece that has elevated the style and comfort of my bedroom. Highly recommend to anyone seeking a blend of luxury and farmhouse charm in their bedding!",

                "reviewText": "I chose this comforter because it was a great value for a guest bedroom.What I liked:The comforter is on a full bed and drops all the way to the floor on both sides and provides plenty of length for my 6'2\" son.The fabric is soft and cozy, but the geometric texture fits the rest of the room.Shams are included.The comforter shipped compressed and had thorough directions for returning the piece to full volume with no wrinkles.It went through my front load washer with no problems or loss of softness (microfiber stayed soft with no pilling, filling didn't separate or bunch.)Comfortably warm in a cool room, but thin enough not to be suffocating.What I didn't like:The comforter can only be oriented one way because of the pintuck design.The quilting isn't incorporated into the pintuck design.Every little speck or stain shows on this fabric.Overall, I felt this was a great quality for the price point. The comforter is lightweight and warm for sleeping. I don't know how well it would fit on a King sized bed, but it has a perfect drop on a full bed.",
