An easy way to update the d\u00e9cor and add some character!The design and colours are gender neutral and would complement different d\u00e9cor styles; boho, modern, farmhouse, or animal theme.I like that the set has different items that look nice together but I wish there was a toddler pillow cover for that later stage, especially considering the relatively high price point.- packed nicely for a gift set- gender neutral- goes well with a variety of d\u00e9cor styles and themes- lovely design- includes matching items for a nursery- no pillow case included- cute tassel details- easy care- microfiber- a bit pricy for $129.99 at the time of writing this reviewI hope you find this review helpful! :)",
