I ordered four of these Shalala quilts in what I thought were four colors (two had different names but ended up being the same color) so I could see them in person and choose the best color. It turned out that the Light Taupe color ended up being the best color for one of the rooms, but I came very close to keeping this one, too, just because it's so beautiful! These quilts are soft, lightweight, good quality, and the one I kept laundered beautifully! Be sure to look through the reviews with pictures and you'll see how pretty and versatile these quilts are. NOTE: I paid full price for this item and this is my honest review. I depend on reviews when making my purchase decisions and hope this review is helpful to you in making your decision.",

There are few covers in this price range that meet all the checkboxes that this does--appearance of stripes/contemporary but subtle, durable with pets, soft, warm, and washable. So cheers. If you want ivory? I vote: do it! BUT, the shams. Get super fluffy pillows to stuff so there's less of a floppy flap.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this Velvet Quilt with the dream of creating that perfect display bed, reminiscent of those you'd spot at places like Pottery Barn. This year, I took the plunge, investing in a quilt and down comforters to bring my vision to life. And let me tell you, this quilt was the crowning glory, turning my dream bed into a reality.With another quilt already adding weight to my bed, I was concerned that this one might be too heavy. To my delight, it turned out to be incredibly lightweight and soft. It's practically perfection! An added bonus was discovering that it came with two matching pillow shams, a delightful surprise that further elevated the overall look of my bed.If you're in the market for a luxurious velvet quilt that won't break the bank or weigh you down, I wholeheartedly recommend this one. It's the epitome of elegance without the hefty price tag or cumbersome bulk!",
