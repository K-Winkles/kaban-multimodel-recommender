These came vacuum sealed in very nice packaging & can easily recommend this product considering the fact that there a premium set, & very reasonably priced for a set of 2 shams and a comforter. My wife loved it.My 2 cents below:Pros:- These just look adorable in boho design & the embroidery work on it - Very soft and very premium quality material. Very comfortable fabric- Fits well in the pillows and the comforter have good dimension to cover the whole bed- Machine washable- Comes as 3 pieces: shams to match the comforter design- Reasonably priced in the competitionCons:- The comforter is not very thick so might not be very usable for extreme winter weather - I wish they had a 5 or 7-pieces set available too as an option",

I would definitely buy this brand again in the future.",
