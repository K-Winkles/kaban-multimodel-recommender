This blanket set is soft and comfy, it isn't stiff like I assumed it would be and its a great size for a toddler bed. The sheets are great too and my son just thinks it has the coolest dino's on it. It does come with a flat sheet (we aren't flat sheet people) so I had it made into a curtain for his window. All in all I was hoping for the best and expecting the worse with this order and this company exceeded my expectations of what we received. Thank you for the GREAT purchase.",
