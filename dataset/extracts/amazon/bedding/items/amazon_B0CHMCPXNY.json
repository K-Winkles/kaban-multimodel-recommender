                "reviewText": "I sleep really hot and this in conjunction with a good set of sheets has helped me get away from waking up soaking wet in the middle of the night.I love how much sturdier it is and that the fabric doesn\u2019t give me the ick like most thinner mattress pads do.I LOVE LOVE LOVE that it is waterproof!!! We have a sweet lil beagle who for a while and now very rarely would pee on the bed when it was time to get in bed. She\u2019d dig her lil comfy nest like dogs do and then she\u2019d just\u2026pee. It\u2019s weird I don\u2019t know, but you can imagine the stress and frustration at the race to rip the covers off the bed before it seeped through to the sheets and then beyond and then having to get them in the laundry and remake the bed - all while so tired you could cry (I did once. She did it 3 times in a row one night and I was beside myself I was so tired). Knowing that this is washable and will protect our mattress if (knock on wood) it ever happens again gives me such a peace of mind.Plus it\u2019s miles more comfortable than your standard cheap mattress pad/cover.",

Reached out to customer service and a replacement was shipped immediately.This mattress pad cover is by far the best cover I have ever had!! Large deep pockets that stay securely in place underneath the mattress. Also, it is quiet. Other waterproof covers can sometimes make a sound when moving about on them. Finally, it is so soft!!!I would highly recommend this mattress pad cover to anyone, whether you need a waterproof one or not.Thanks for your excellent customer service!",
