The sheets feel like a silky cotton, the comforter fluffs out nicely after washing and drying, and I love that the texture is already wrinkly so it looks casual. I was worried about the lack of reviews and cheap price but I couldn't be happier! This feels like much better quality than cheap sets I've gotten from big chain stores.",

I can always match some different pillowcases to it and different shams, that really doesn't affect my rating much at all.the packaging was awesome, all vacuum sealed and clean, very impressed overall.I haven't opened it yet because I want to use it for a guest bedroom which I have not set up fully yet and I don't want to get it dirty but when I have it all busted out and washed and fluffed I will take some more pictures! I highly recommend! Also just looking at this it would be a wonderful gift \u2764\ufe0fCheers",
