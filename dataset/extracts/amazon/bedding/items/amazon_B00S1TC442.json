                "reviewText": "For the past couple years my girlfriend and I have gone through a few cheap comforters. We never really gave much thought to them and subsequently they never impressed us. I grew up using a down comforter and have very fond memories of that blanket. The comfort and warmth was something that I hadn't experienced since I had moved out and gotten my own comforter. So this has been in the back of my mind ever since but I wasn't sure if I wanted to dish out that kind of money for a blanket and also deal with the hassle of dry cleaning it. Also by purchasing a down blanket we'd be supporting an industry in which the down feathers from geese are taken from them and that's not something we personally wanted to support. So for all those reason we started looking into down alternative. The first thing that made me question these products was the price, they seem TOO cheap. I was raised with the mantra, \"you get what you pay for\" and with that in mind I was quite weary when looking at these products. I always make sure to compare many different products and read through the reviews, both good and bad before I buy something. I decided to take a chance on this particular one as it seemed to be the highest rated by customers and I liked what I saw in the images provided by said customer. If anything, the price was low enough that I wasn't too worried if I didn't end up liking it.Now I wasn't actually home when it arrived but my girlfriend confirmed that it was very flat right out of the package, as was expected. By the time I got home 2-3 hours later it appeared to be fully fluffed. The material it is made of is very soft and comfortable on your skin and I was pleasantly surprised with the thickness/fluffyness. It is a fairly light blanket, similar to a down blanket I suppose in that regard. So far I have only slept with it one night but it did a great job of keeping me warm. I live in Wisconsin and the temperatures this week have been ranging from -10 over night to single digits during the day. I had been using 2 blankets prior to getting this one and sometimes I would still wake up in the night feeling cold. But so far with this blanket alone I have stayed warm which again was a pleasant surprise.I do have to say that this doesn't remind me a whole lot of my down blanket and I think that may have to do with the material used in the shell. And you're not going to be 100% able to recreate a down blanket not using down. So if you are looking for something that feels exactly like down and won't be satisfied otherwise, this might not be for you. However, if you are looking for a good quality, warm, fluffy and affordable priced blanket that will give you that \"cloud\" like feeling, I think you would be really happy with this blanket.Again this is my opinion from using it for one night, I can not comment on the durability or longevity of this blanket, but I am hoping that it holds up over time.**also our cats immediately fell in love with it, it is their new favorite spot to nap.",

The price is your guarantee that purchasing this comforter will definitely give you your money's worth (if you don't feel like a downright thief!).",
