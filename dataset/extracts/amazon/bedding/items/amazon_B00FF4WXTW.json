LOVE the espresso brown backing (not faded out chalky brown).. some queen size quilts barely cover the mattress, this one is PERFECT... not too heavy, not too light, it\u2019s just right.. It lays very nicely (even while sleeping) and doesn\u2019t end up on the floor like some super lightweight quilts.. I didn\u2019t really need the pillows but they are a nice accent nonetheless.",

Plus, wanted something with a pattern that was easy on the eyes, and came with small pillows. This is our favorite comforter set. There are small patterns of glitter/shimmer, which appeals to me, and my husband likes the grey/white/merlot pattern.

I bought the king size and it fits well with approx 10 inches overhang on each side and at the foot. The pillow shams are also well-made. The colors of the material are beautiful!

                "reviewText": "Good value for the money. Feels and looks good in quality, but is not lux. The colors and prints were on point with the product images online. Hated the larger brown accent pillow (cheap, small, and no fluff) so we\u2019re still looking for the right fit and used one from our old set temporarily. Generally very happy to find something to tie the grey and chocolate color mix of our bedroom furniture, paint, and curtains together, but it might be a bit feminine/busy pattern for the straight line and masculine feel of the rest of the room. My negatives are mainly whether it\u2019s the right fit for our style. No complaints about the product itself, except the chocolate accent pillow.",

It came quickly, and in time for Thanksgiving. I love the look. It looks more expensive than what we paid. The comforter isn't too heavy, which is fine because we live in the south. We can always add a quilt or down comforter when it gets cold. To be honest, we previously ordered a set from this grouping, and it was terrible! Cheap looking, hard fabric and had \"sequins\" on the pillow! I took a chance and I'm happy with how it looks and feels. The comforter and pillows were a bit wrinkled, but we steamed them, and it looks fine.",

                "reviewText": "This is the second Madison Park quilt I have purchased for a king sized bed this month. The first was the Lucy quilt for a guest bed. I was so impressed that I decided to search for one for my room. The fabric is thick and held up great in a washer with an agitator. It isn\u2019t super soft like some quilts, but I am not sleeping with it so that wasn\u2019t part of my decision process. It came packaged well, taped fully around all edges of the box. Inside the quilt was in a thick plastic bag like quilts for sale in retail stores. Each of the throw pillows were vacuum sealed. I tossed them in the dryer with a dryer ball for an hour and they were fluffy and good to go. I have espresso bedroom furniture with silver knobs that doesn\u2019t really go with the modern neutral farmhouse theme of the rest of my home. This quilt helped bring it all together. I love that it goes with taupe, gray, brown, cream, and white. I only used one of the included throw pillows. This is a great buy for the quality. I purchased a quilt from Levtex and although it was softer, I was not impressed with the dye quality or fabric quality. This one was far superior.",
