                "reviewText": "Sleeping on a queen sized Tempurpedic mattress can be wonderful, except when your partner hogs up your queen sized comforter in the middle of the night. I got pretty tired of that happening and decided that it was time to get a king sized mattress for my queen bed. So I ordered this set by Jokolo brand. When I put it on the bed, as you can imagine, it was wider and a tad longer than my other comforter was, but I figured it would be a perfect solution for the problem I had been having. And... I was correct! With that, I would advise anyone who is having the same problem as I was - get yourself a king sized comforter! Now... on to the actual product review.The set comes in a surprisingly small box which upon opening, you will find that the contents have been vacuum wrapped. Cut the bag open and POOF! All the fluffy goodness starts to expand, no problems there. This comes with two king sized pillow cases also. I put the comforter on the bed and it was SO soft! Not fuzzy soft, just good fabric. It has the perfect amount of stuffing, fluffy and light, but enough to keep the warmth in. Once you are under the comforter, you will notice how cozy and snuggly it is. I pulled it up around my neck and got into sleeping position and seriously, it was like I was sleeping in a cloud (also for the fact that I got the white comforter set). I would have opted for a different color (at the time all that was available was gray, black and white) just because I'm a little concerned with getting it dirty, but it appears to be machine washable.This is a VERY, VERY nice set - definitely worth the price, which I thought was extremely reasonable. I can say that this set was comparable to what you would find at a 4-star hotel. I'm pretty sure that if you get one for yourself, you will not be disappointed.",

The overall material is polyester which gives it a smooth feeling and helps with it being slightly resistant to certain stains. The stitching is done very well but it is not going to blow you away. I don't see it it coming undone but after a couple of washes they may begin to fail. It fit a queen mattress very well. Overall it is soft and does give a bet an extra layer of comfort. Do recommend to anyone looking to add a nice comforter on a budget.",

It's not a heavy weight(ed) quilt, it's fairly light weight for the \"heft\" and feel of it, but it does keep me warm at night, and feels nice while it does. If you like a heavy blanket over you, this isn't quite heavy enough to press down on you like a thick wool blanket would. It is heavier and thicker than a cheap two ply quilt, though, and the stuffing is good enough to give it some softness and feel.Color was nice, grey works well for me. Could work as a thick blanket for crawling under on the couch (a bit oversized, but perfect for snuggling if you are sick, or sharing with a spouse or your dog(s), I am sure.The feel is smooth, but smooth cotton, not satin or silk. It flows over the sheets, not slides or glides, which is nice. That means it tends to shift a bit during the night when I move, but it doesn't slide off the bed and end up at the foot, or off the side. It's got a bit of traction, and sticks on the bed nicely.",

                "reviewText": "Updated Review:I washed this separately in cold water normal cycle and used a medium heat perm press cycle for the dryer. They came out with discoloration patches on the pillows cases and the blanket. It doesn't look like bleach stains or like the color drained out. It looks like they're are darket grey blotches over the original lighter gray, almost like water stains. They don't stand out too badly and are in smallish areas so I'll still use them, but I'm disappointed to say the least. I honestly don't it could have been the way I washed them, I've never run into this problem with anything else I've washed and I was gental with them.Also this blanket is Very Fluffy, I own similar style blankets with the quilted squares but they are no where near as fluffy as this is. It wouldn't fit in my closet with my other blankets so I had to store it in a large empty draw, by itself and even then I had to shove it down to fit and close the draw. Just plan to have a whole shelf dedicated to storing this blanket when not in use.Old Review:Fluffy and soft but not too heavy the perfect weight. The color was lighter than I hoped but it's pretty, has a slight light blueish gray tint to it. Now I just need matching sheets and more pillow cases.",

                "reviewText": "I recently ordered, and received, an affordable king-sized comforter set and I'm very impressed. The set, made of soft microfiber, fits my bed perfectly and is incredibly comfortable.Initially compact due to vacuum packaging, the comforter fluffed up nicely after a bit of shaking and stretching. It's ideal for all seasons, providing warmth in winter and coolness in summer.Since it is 100% polyester, it should wear well and maintain comfortable temperatures year-round. Writing this in winter, and preferring a cold room, I did have to layer a thin throw blanket on top of the comforter for optimal warmth, but it's not a big deal.Another aspect I appreciate is the use of environmentally friendly and safe materials, offering peace of mind regarding health and environmental impact.Overall, this bedding set offers great comfort, style, and quality at an affordable price. It's a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a reliable and cozy bedding solution.",

Super warm, I mean so warm that I have to uncover during the night. It has a nice feel to it and my wife loves it so but I wish it had more weight to it. Otherwise a very good comforter at a price that won't break the bank.",
