My son says it keeps his bed cool too. Rather than hot which causes him to get sweaty while sleeping.Definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this mattress protector for my new mattress because it had good reviews. Honestly, it's soft and it fits my 12\" queen mattress easily. It's not noisy either and feels like it's made from good material. I didn't test the waterproof features or anything but I'm sure it's good at that. My main concern is that IT TRAPS SO MUCH HEAT. I guess I'm a hot sleeper but this is the first time that I would wake up in the middle of the night sweating because of how hot I was. I thought it was just my duvet cover/comforter at first but once I ripped off this mattress protector I realized how much cooler it was to just sleep on my mattress without the protector on. Unfortunately can't use this anymore because of how unbearably hot it made me while sleeping :/",

The deep pockets make it easy to install and it stays put when there is a top sheet over it. Shipping was fast and the price was unbeatable. Would buy again.",

Something to consider later, don\u2019t wash it on a rainy day!It is comfortable on the bed and doesn\u2019t feel like you are on plastic and is not noisy or hot at all.",
