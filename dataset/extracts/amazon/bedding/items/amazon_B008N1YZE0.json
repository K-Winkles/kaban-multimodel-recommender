                "reviewText": "I am getting pretty old, and I am finally able to say out loud \"I am obsessive about sheets and until now they always have let me down. One of my first jobs had the company send me to San Francisco for some training. They had me staying at The Palace hotel. It was this glamorous, luxury historic hotel that ruined sheets for me for over 30 years.When I crawled into bed at that hotel I experienced what everyone talked about. Until then a sheet was a sheet was a sheet. I have spent the last 30 some years buying sheets that tout high thread count or luxury highend hotel style sheets, Ultra luxurious, whatever they all lied.I had been browsing sheet sets for a couple weeks now and when I received notice that these now had a $10 off coupon I could not resist the purchase. After so many let downs I had very few expectations for this set. Then I took them out of the packaging and they felt so soft and lux.The real test though would be how they felt when it came time to sleep. (Play some etheral music here) first I should say that putting these sheets on my oversized queen mattress was a breeze, great deep sides and the elastic on the fitted sheet was great. Then I slept and guess what?When I woke up I immediately went to Amazon and bought 4 more sets. I already had the Gray so I got the Navy, Sage Green, Burgandy and Yellow Gold.You should try these, they will not disappoint I promise.",

                "reviewText": "I MUST admit, I didn't read the product description before buying nor did I read any reviews. These sheets were delivered real fast (1star) they are really really soft (1star) they are As Described in product description EXCEPTIONALLY THIN, which makes them breathable (not cheap) (1 star). When I did start to read the other reviews, others mentioned the bad smell and poor quality after they washed their sheets as described. As soon as my husband and I were done relishing the softness, I put them in the washer ALONE on the delicate cycle. I say alone simply because I can imagine washing my silk blouse with a pair of jeans, not a good combination nor a good outcome. Nevertheless the sheets washed well and NEVER had a bad smell to begin with. (1star) What I did notice after the wash was that there were a few pieces of stray threads on the fitted sheet, which, if not snipped immediately could possibly cause the stitching to come undone. While snipping these strays, I examined the stitching on every piece and I was thoroughly satisfied with it. I too have a king size pillowtop mattress and these sheets fit fine. (1star) With that said, if after sleeping on them tonight, they fall apart or fall off as several others have complained, then and only then will I revise my review. As for me right now, I look forward to sleeping with these sheets tonight. And if this review doesn't need revision in the morning. I will purchase another set.",

                "reviewText": "Over all, I would give the sheets a grade of B- (4 out of 5 or 80%).Color: I ordered The color gold in this sheet set as I had just received a new dark red and vintage gold comforter set. In most cases pictures of products online may not give you a sense of the true color. In the case of these sheets the picture is not quite accurate. In the picture that I saw, the sheets were a standard gold color. However, when I received the sheets I was surprised at how YELLOW they were. It was a golden yellow, but the yellow dominates. It is fine as I can configure the comforter pillows to hide the sheets. I am now on the hunt for a color that is a true gold.Quality: The quality is average. Some of the other reviewers have stated that the sheets are rather thin. I would concur. I bought these sheets during the winter. Depending on how you make your bed a thicker sheet may be preferable. Because I have four layers on my bed the thinness of the sheet is not an issue at this time. I suspect after a few more washes there might be. This sheet may be perfect as a summer sheet set. The stitching on the sheet is basic. The stripes on the sheets are barely noticeable.Softness: These sheets are indeed very soft. Feels very nice on the skin!First wash and dry: I followed the directions on the tag with a low temp wash and dry. The sheets show no signs of wear or have tears as other reviewers mentioned. They did well for the first wash.Fit: We have a King bed and after the first wash the sheets fit well. They state they are deep pockets and I found them to be fairly deep. We have a Sleep Number bed and the sheets fit well. I would have preferred a deeper pocket that would bug the bed tighter.Price: I wanted some gold sheets for a good price. Honestly, I believe the quality of the sheet is on par for the price I paid.Would I buy again: No, I would not buy these sheets again. I prefer thicker sheets. I am concerned about the thinness of the sheets and how they will hold up to multiple washes over time.If you are looking for a thin soft economical sheet set that will fit your bed and hold up the first wash and dry, you may like these sheets.",
