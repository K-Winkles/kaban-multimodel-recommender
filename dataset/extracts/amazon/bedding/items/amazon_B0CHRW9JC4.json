                "reviewText": "A little background: I used to live in the Midwest and relocated to Florida last year. Needless to say, our Northern comforters were a bit *much* in the Southern heat/humidity. I have literally been on the hunt for a year, looking for a comforter that checks all the boxes. I've bought super expensive muslin blankets. Super expensive fuzzy Oprah-approved blankets. Middle of the road, lightweight comforters. Affordable knit blankets. NONE of them have worked, except this quilt. THIS QUIILT CHECKS ALL THE BOXES!!!\u2022 It's SO lightweight. You can move freely underneath and not feel like you're suffocating to death.\u2022 It's SOFT! I've had quilts in the past that weren't soft, or they were really stiff and not pleasant to sleep under. This is soft to the touch but the quilting pattern means it still holds some of its shape instead of draping like a sheet.\u2022 It's NOT HOT! I'm one of those weird people who want to sleep with *something* covering them at all times, even in the dead of summer, but I don't want to be hot. This quilt accomplishes that! It keeps me warm and doesn't let the wind from the AC and the multitude of fans blowing seep in like some other blankets. In the week that I've had this, I haven't woken up sweating once.\u2022 I love the design on it. I got the square/diamond pattern and it looks awesome. It seems like it will hold up to cat claws/dog nails.\u2022 Washing/drying was a breeze. It doesn't take up an ungodly amount of room in either machine nor does it take three hours to dry out because it's so thick/heavy.I've seen some other people complaining or commenting on the length on the side of the bed, like how much hangs down. I think mine is fine. I got a queen-size quilt for a queen-size bed and there's maybe 6-7 inches on each side? Maybe more? I'm terrible with measurements. But it doesn't look weird or like the sizing is off. If you want more of an overhang, size up. I cared more about how it actually functions versus how it looks. The looks are just a bonus to me.TLDR; I LOVE THIS QUILT! If you're on the fence, just buy it! It's worth every penny!",

I have two dogs that get on the bed and one is a shedder so I wanted to be able to throw this in the washer. I prefer cotton but this microfiber is really nice. Iy is very lightweight but with a blanket underneath it offers plenty of warmth on our cold Michigan nights. It definitely looks like a more expensive quilt. Love it.",
