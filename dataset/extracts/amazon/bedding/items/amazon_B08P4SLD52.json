I have a king bed, so I ordered the California King and it fits perfectly. It arrived shrink wrapped so I threw it in the dryer for 10 minutes and it definitely helped. Yes, it is a little wrinkled but seriously, it is a bed cover! My bed never looks like the magazines anyway! The material is really soft and I think it will be warm enough in the winter in North Florida. It can get pretty chilly here. It is not so heavy that it will be too much in the summer. If you are on the fence like I was, do not hesitate any longer. Just buy it!",

It\u2019s medium thick.. so not too thick to wear it\u2019s heavy and hot but not too thin to wear it feels cheap and cold. It\u2019s LITERALLY perfect \u2026 if you are thinking of getting it\u2014do it. Also it did come with wrinkles. I would recommend ironing or washing. I ironed mine. :) the packages is vacuumed sealed.",

Super fluffy, light, whimsical, and gorgeous. I had my doubts (scouring the reviews of every bed set on Amazon), but I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t just order this from the get-go.The comforter fits our bed just right, we like the decorative shams, and the material is very soft and light. It wrinkles very easily, but I don\u2019t mind because I LOVE THIS BED SET!I love the color (light sage, I would say exactly like the back of a sagebrush leaf if you live in the desert), and I was between sage and olive. Saw an olive one for sale on FB marketplace and it IS a lot more yellow than I wanted (like a green olive in a jar).",

It\u2019s warmer than a quilt but cooler than a dense comforter. For me, it\u2019s perfect for sleeping in 70 degree house temperature. Love that it\u2019s reversible as well. A downside I would say is that it can get wrinkly at times but it\u2019s not horrible especially in person. I bought a king size for my queen because I like oversized comforters.

                "reviewText": "Pretty color and pattern. Super fluffy and cozy. It\u2019s really comfortable when laying on top of the bed or first snuggling in. But the last two nights we\u2019ve had it on our bed, we\u2019ve both woken up sweaty. This bedding is perfect for cold winter places, or if you like to sleep hot. But if you run hot already or sleep cold, not the one for you. Also runs a little small, I ordered a king for my queen sized bed so we\u2019d have plenty of over hang, it fits the same as all my Queen sized comforters, I\u2019d order up if you want any over hang.",
