I originally bought the oatmeal, but returned for the beige because it\u2019s much darker in person than in the picture, but once I felt the quality of the original one I bought, I didn\u2019t want to go anywhere else to buy one. Amazing price for this set. Flat sheet, fitted sheet, 4 pillow shams and a comforter for under $70 AND great quality? Can\u2019t beat it!",

They are so soft , they feel almost buttery soft to me and smooth. The comforter itself is soft and plush. Feels like it would be too hot to use during the summer months being from Texas but we will see!My only issue so far is that when I washed the sheets there was some fraying like some loose threads. I washed it right out of the package.But whatever i guess for the price being on a budget for a whole bedding set I can live with it.",
