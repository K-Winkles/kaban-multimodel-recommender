I use a duvet cover which adds two layers of cotton to the fluffy white down comforter. The result is a lightweight but extremely cozy cover. We're using the \"palatial size\" to cover twin adjustable beds and the 120 x 98 size is perfect! Highly recommend giving this comforter a try when in the market for luxury down ... amazing value.",

                "reviewText": "***Only had comforter for a few days, so will update if necessary at a later date.***Picture 1: comforter inside the duvet cover I ordered at the same time. As you can see, even inside the duvet cover, this comforter is quite fluffy. It has not been washed and dried yet either. The slight new smell disappeared after allowing it to air for a couple of hours, per manufacturers instructions.Picture 2: the satisfaction guarantee and unpacking instructions included in the packaging.This is an amazing comforter! The quality is great, it fluffs up beautifully, it's just the right weight, it's soft right out of the bag, and oh so comfortable. It was package well, inside a vacuum sealed bag and into a breathable fabric bag, and shipped in a solid and sealed Amazon cardboard box. At this point, I'll never go back to a polyester fill comforter again!!Now to address complaints for this comforter.First off, if you're not familiar with, or owned and slept with a down comforter, do some research before selecting one. Doing so will ensure you know the terminology, production, quality standards, myths and gimmicks associated with down comforters, and ensure you are satisfied with your purchase. I suggest Googling a third party review site, such as, supercomfysleep.com and goodhousekeeping.com. Both these sites explain fill-power, construction, and cleaning; while supercomfysleep.com covers myths and a few other misnomers associated with goose down comforters. Now onto specific complaints in the reviews.Noisy: all goose down comforters will have more rustling noise than a poly-filled comforter. My personal experience with comforters in general, is that they create some rustling, period. If you're that sensitive to noise, perhaps you should stick with cotton/polyester blend blankets, and avoid comforters all together... or invest in a good pair of ear plugs. Frankly, I find this complaint a bit overly dramatic and unnecessarily critical. This comforter has average rustling sound equal to a poly-fill, and decreases with both, over time.Not as pictured, particularly the fluff factor:The manufacturer ships this goose down comforter, vaccum packed, which removes all the air from the product and the bag. This has a decompression effect on the down and requires it to be laid out and fluffed (shaken) several times, for a minimum of 2 hours for the fluffiness to return, and over several days it will reach full fluff capacity. These instructions (see included picture 2) are clearly laid out in the paper insert included with the comforter. If you have zero experience with vacuum sealing/packaging, then you won't understand this, and incorrectly assume you've been ripped off. You haven't, you're just not following instructions.False advertisement (claiming not filled with actual goose down):First off, yes it is. Second, down and feathers are two very different things. Down does not have stiff and thick quills like feathers, nor does it have the same structure and consistency of a feather. Down is very fine, fluffy and fuzzy in consistency, as it is the insulating layer underneath the outer feathers of a goose, and it's quill/spine is very thin and small compared to a feather. If an animal; such as a dog, masticates (chews) on down it will NOT look like down anymore. Rather, it will be shredded and separated from it's fine quill spine, making it appear to be bits of opaque plastic and pieces of mushy material. And frankly using a picture of this exact situation (reviewer pictured masticated down her dog had chewed on after chewing a hole in this purchased comforter) as proof it's not filled with goose down is either very naive/ignorant, or worse, disingenuous and blatant misrepresentation. I have no doubt that this comforter is filled with quality goose down, as it's reviews and ratings speak of its quality, and the manufacturer. Not to mention the guarantee the manufacturer offers with this product. Moreover, this manufacturer and comforter is listed by supercomfysleep.com as the number one pick, in their reviews.Therefore, I'm a completely satisfied customer and highly recommend this goose down comforter and manufacturer. It is a quality comforter for the price, with exceptional fill-power, and manufacturing. But, as I stated in the beginning of this review, be a wise consumer and educate yourself before purchasing. As this will ensure you are satisfied with your purchase, and will have reasonable expectations of the product's quality and construction. And hopefully, you'll come to feel like I do about this comforter: I'll never go back to a polyester filled comforter again!",

There is barely any sound, there is no smell, and it is a great value for a down comforter. I may purchase another in a different weight for other seasons. This makes our bed feel like a cloud!",

                "reviewText": "So I am sorry I didn't take a picture before we put the duvet on but the comforter is white and we have a beloved dog who sheds a lot. But the size of this comforter is PERFECT! My husband and I have a king sized bed and, our last comforter's size was the best we had had up until now (we have been married for 30 years). I am a comforter hog (in my sleep) and after years of being awoke by my poor husband, who was pulling the comforter back over himself because he was freezing due to my subconscious selfishness, we looked for larger comforters until we found our last one. Due to our old comforters wonderful size, we kept it much longer than we should have. It is now so dingy in places. We have tried to try to replace it over the last two years because of this. We have looked at LL Bean, Macys, Lands End and Bed Bath and Beyond for one that would compare in size to no avail. A few weeks ago I found the Luxurious Super King sized comforter and I began to hope that we could finally replace our now ugly old comforter. The Luxurious Super King sized comforter has all other comforters beat that we have used before in terms of size!It is long enough to cover the mattress and boxspring. I am so confused as to why the size of this comforter is not the standard. To buy a standard king sized comforter you have to put up with either portions of your mattress and/or boxspring showing and a high chance that one person of a couple will freeze. Not with this comforter! No showing mattresses or box springs (love, love, love)! Good bye problematic bed skirts that adjust and are difficult to get back in place or remove to wash and have to put back after completely disassembling your bed. I never liked the bed skirts really anyway but preferred it over the mattress or boxspring showing! It is also soft.My only very mild complaint is it is really warm. We usually use our comforter all year round and will not be able to do that with this comforter. We had to turn down our heat quite a bit in our bedroom after the first night. So we have to save some money, lol! We will use the money we save to acquire a comforter for the summer. But we are over the moon over the size!!! Time will tell about its quality but feel it is an economical price so are very pleased with our purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I received this \"100% Siberian goose down luxurious king duvet\" on 29 Jan 2021 but held off reviewing it until 24 Feb 2021 as I wanted to give it a fair trial.Sadly, it'd seem that quite a number of the reported flaws are correct.1. It was super flat upon opening the vacuum pack. After laying it out to air for more than 3 weeks, plus throwing it in my tumbler dryer twice, the loft is still not there!2. My tag also states \"minimum 75% down\" and not the 100% as advertised (see picture). It was also printed \"made in China\" but that is not an issue with me as most things are nowadays. Peculiarly, the tag omits the country of origin of the goose down3. When I held the duvet up to the light, it is readily apparent that the down filling is unevenly distributed with some square boxes allowing quite a bit of light through. This was reported in another user's review4. I don't quite understand what a baffle box stitch is. The stitching on my Duvet seemed rather ordinary5. There are no cleaning or care instructions on the included tagsNow for the good points1. The duvet is Responsible Down Standard certified2. The duvet has passed the OEKO-TEX standard 100 for harmful substances3. The duvet does rustle but this is not louder than my previous synthetic fill duvet. Neither does it affect my sleep4. There is no discernible smell5. The outer 100% cotton covering (advertised as 1200 thread count Egyptian cotton) is smooth to the touch. But I still use a duvet cover to protect it.If you are looking for a 100% goose down with the country of origin for the down clearly stated, this duvet may not be for you.I am also disappointed that my duvet failed to fluff up after prolonged use.",
