I was worried because it is on the thinner side but it keeps you so warm. It has four corner ties, making it easy to put on, and it's reversible, which is a great plus. I will say that white is more off-white than pure white but still a nice color. I highly recommend buying and I am considering getting another in a different color!",

It does get wrinkles no mader what out of the dryer and straight to the he'd. But I like wrinkles. I mean, if I could show my messy room do you think I care about wrinkles? It's the damn zipper!

This coupled with the very thin fabric makes it look rather sloppy on my bed (even with the filler inside). I realize description states thin, but I did not expect it to be like a sheet with zipper. I would not describe this as elegant but I do appreciate the soft, vintage, lovingly worn feel to it. The color too, is a soft creamy color which lends a warm simplicity to my room. Perhaps if it were more fit for a twin, I would give higher rating.",

Tie ins are also included which is important to keep the corners from slipping inside your duvet. I like how the pillow cases have a ruffle on the outsides, helps them to stand out.",
