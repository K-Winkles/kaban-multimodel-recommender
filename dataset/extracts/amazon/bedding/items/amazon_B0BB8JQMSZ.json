Even that comparison might be a bit of a stretch because I prefer the look of H.I./F.I . over this one. It's perfectly functional and serviceable, but it's kind of like they took some low thread count cotton fabric, threw in some fill, and stitched it together in the simplest way possible. I guess I was hoping for a bit more uniformity in the ruffling and wrinkling so that it looked 'chic'. Instead, it looks like a random wrinkly mess that can be fixed to a certain extent with an iron (but who wants to iron a comforter?). As far as warmth, it's lightweight so can be used in summer or shoulder seasons but probably not your go-to for winter.",

In the packaging it looks super white but as I unraveled it, it showed clear signs of maybe water damage. Love most of shabby chics products but this was such a let down. It makes me feel super itchy. I washed it and it doesn\u2019t feel any better :(",
