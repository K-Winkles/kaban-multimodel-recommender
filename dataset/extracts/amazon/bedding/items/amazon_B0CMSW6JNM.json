But other than that, it\u2019s comfy as heck, soft to the touch , it\u2019s just way comfier than I thought. One warning though, it might come sort of messed up on the edges because of the amount of stitching done on it, but it\u2019s easy to just cut off the extra string hanging loose.",

The comforter is a little poofy like a duvet (but without all the hassle of dealing with an actual duvet), with an interesting raised pattern. I liked having all the extra pillow covers (didn\u2019t use them all in the photo), especially the body pillow sham.This is a really good set if you have a lot of other pattern and color in your bedroom. It looks clean and feminine, and goes with whatever else you want to add as accent. I was nicely surprised with this!",

I love that the set has a body pillow because it gives the other pillows more of a fluffy full look. I like that it is just a solid color. The set doesn't need any \"foo foo\" to make it pop, it just pops by itself. I love the design and the 3D pattern. Everything fits as it should and the top layer comforter hangs nicely. The comforter is actually warm and comfortable. Nice set",
