                "reviewText": "So for years my boyfriend has always liked \u201cjersey sheets\u201d or \u201ctee shirt\u201d sheets or sheets made of flannel. He says he doesn\u2019t like the feeling of cold \u201csilky\u201d feeling sheets as he\u2019s always cold. I\u2019m opposite and am always hot, and anytime we stayed in a nice hotel I looked forward to being able to sleep on cooler, taught, soft sheets for a couple of nights. I was able to deal with our old sheets but the issue we both hated was after awhile any sheet we got would get pilling. We even splurged and got a $60 flannel sheet which did the same thing forcing me to shave off these little annoying fuzz balls that make it feels like there is thousands of crumbs on the sheets. I also would wash our bedding once a week because the Jersey sheets seemed to \u201cgrow\u201d as we move around in bed making it so the sheet was not taught and super annoying to lay on. The day I would wash them they would be comfortable but ultimately by the end of the week they would be almost hanging off our mattress. I ordered these sheets on a whim and got them the same day and immediately just threw out the jersey sheet and put this on (I didn\u2019t even wash it, I know it\u2019s gross but I was desperate for a comfy nights sleep and they came around 8pm) when I put them on I realized how soft and comfortable they felt. I also liked how the pillow cases are larger than most pillow cases that I have had in the past. We\u2019ve been using these sheets for about a week and I love how I don\u2019t wake up with my pillow popping out of the case anymore. The sheets have loosed ever so slightly since a week of sleeping but still are really taught and comfortable. They are cooler than flannel or fabric sheets and are initially cold when you first lay on them but I wouldn\u2019t consider them \u201ccooling\u201d but they keep me from feeing extremely hot. They are way better than I ever would have expected for the price. I look forward to laying on them at the end of each day, even my boyfriend laid in bed the day I got them and said \u201cwow I didn\u2019t think I would like sheets like this, these are so soft!\u201d And fell asleep immediately. We ended up ordering a second set in grey and the color is pretty. I still have yet to wash them, I usually use 2 tide pods when washing the bedding but I might get some fabric softener (as I hear it helps with pilling) to prevent the possibility of having that happen to these sheets in the future. I am hoping they hold up well after the wash and longer use. If they start to pill after wash, I will come back and update my review. Until then, I would highly recommend these sheets for the quality and the price point that they are offered at. Honestly, at this point even if they pill months from now I probably wouldn\u2019t even be upset as long as they stay the same price I would just buy another set as they are just that comfortable and soft.",

Washed and dryed them as per instructions came out of the dryer soft and wrinkle free. I did notice some loose threads on the pillow case but not on the sheets. Hope they last. The fitted sheet doesn't stay tucked in, it gets loose after sleeping on it. That being said overall good sheets but I noticed after purchasing that these are 200 thread count. That's the lowest thread count I've purchased. That being said arrived on time and reasonably priced. I would recommend these sheets. Also I'll ad that my I-Comfort mattress is 9 1/2\" thick and the fitted sheet fits perfectly, any thicker I think you'd have trouble putting it on and staying on. \ud83e\udd14 I noticed the oil from my face has stained the pillow case and won't wash out. Any tips?",

                "reviewText": "My favorite sheets EVER and the only ones I use are TENCEL Sheets from west elm, and I have three sets that I rotate through but let me tell you\u2026 I like to bring my own sheets when I travel so I bought these king sized sheets for that purpose. These sheets are TO DIE FOR and might even be better than west elms sheets!!! Reasons why you need them:1. Cheap, AND excellent quality!!! West elm\u2019s sheets are $100+2. Allergy friendly!!! I have really bad issues with allergies and dust mites, so my reusable fitted-sheet style mattress protector and these sheets are a match made in heaven and I haven\u2019t had any problems yet!3. Literally so soft- like butter! No joke!4. Big and fit with extra space on the bed- some people might not like this but I loved it5. Breathable! Keep you cool when it\u2019s hot, but will also keep you warm in the winter! I know it sounds weird but I\u2019m serious! Could also pair with a big fuzzy blanket on top for winter and you have a TON of warmth but still the amazing feel of the soft sheets.6. Comes in soooo many different colors! I got the pink and was worried they\u2019d be more light purple cuz of the photo, but they\u2019re the most beautiful shade of pink! Definitely lean more toward the purple spectrum but it is pink!In conclusion, I\u2019m obsessed. I am extremely picky about my sheets and I am literally blown away by this purchase. You need these sheets, DON\u2019T HESITATE! These are THE ONE! This is not sponsored at all but I\u2019d seriously recommend these sheets to anyone i know. I\u2019m ready to be their spokesperson \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
