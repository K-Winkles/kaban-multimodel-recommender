                "reviewText": "I bought these sheets during the July prime sale. I read the numerous great compliments and of course read the ones that were not so complementary. They were a good price on sale and most of the comments on how soft they were, wrinkle free, and most of all that they were cool, made me purchase these. I couldn\u2019t be happier with my purchase. I washed and dried them and they came out of the dryer just fine. Put them on the bed and very little wrinkles. Did I mention how soft they are? Very very soft and light. I am very hot natured and live in Houston Texas which is brutal right now. I suffer from night sweats. I cannot say these are miracle sheets but I can say I\u2019ve had the best sleep in a while because the sheets were indeed cooling and breathable as well as very soft and luxurious feeling . I have sheets that I paid hundreds of dollars for that ate 100% 1,000+ Thread\u2019 \u2018hotel\u2019 quality cotton. Those sheets I could take out of the dryer as soon as the dryer stopped and they still looked like they had been rolled in a ball for two or three weeks. Yes they were indeed high-quality combed cotton, but they were heavy and not cooling at all. These sheets I gave a a 5+ rating in every area. I see some comments about the piping is not as pretty or luxurious as it should be or maybe the edging and hem should be thicker and better quality. I found no problems with the stitching. The piping was fine but most of all they gave me great comfort and a good nights cooling sleep and that\u2019s all that matters. I am very happy and satisfied with my purchase.I\u2019m thrilled that the sheets come in a large assortment of colors because I\u2019m going to be buying many more.",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Soft, held up to first wash, rayon sheets.",
                "reviewText": "I purchased a queen set in ocean on sale for my daughter. They are very soft. You can definitely tell they are rayon; remember to use a dryer sheet to minimize build up of static electricity. They\u2019ll be comfortable and great for my daughter. My one complaint was that one of the pillow cases had an open seam where the surger was doing finishing. It is small enough to stitch up myself; I\u2019d rather keep the carbon footprint of all the shipping back and forth low than deal with exchanges, especially for a $25 sheet set of six.I also purchased king sets in ocean, tree moss green, salmon pink, tree and the light sea foam green color. I gave two sets to my mother and kept two for myself to try. They fit my deep king size mattress just fine, though I can see that if you have an *extra* deep mattress or a mattress with a topper on it, you could struggle with the fitted sheets.I gave four stars based on them being true to the description, true to color, soft, and coming out of the wash according to washing instructions as expected (intact, true to color, not wrinkled beyond recognition, etc). I knocked a star off based on the pillowcase seam in the Queen set.I will say that I have been a lifetime sleeper on supima sateen weave cotton sheets; the older style Kirkland brand packs that Costco used to sell before they changed up and the quality went down. I\u2019ve been looking for sheets to replace the several sets I bought years ago there for what seems like forever now. With that said, like all humans, I am biased about my preferences to what I \u201clike\u201d in a sheet or deem \u201ccomfortable\u201d. It can\u2019t be summed up in a thread count, a buzzy marketing term, or a trend designed to manipulate an algorithm to draw traffic to a listing.For me, sheets need to:-Be soft, but not slick or slippery (bye bye satin, silk, etc). but not so soft it sticks to you (deuces microfiber, you stifling killer of sleep).-Have a gentle crispness that keeps them just on the cusp of looking as though they have been starched but haven\u2019t been (No thanks, percale. No one deserves accidental rug burn from sheets).-Be quiet so that when you or your partner rustle or get up, it doesn\u2019t sound like someone is *running at incredible speeds* while wearing a polyester track suit in bed.-machine wash reliably and well according to directions, including staying true to color (see ya later to all those too thinly weaved fabric and poorly sewn/dyed/manufactured sheets)-not be too hot or too cold \ud83d\ude02 which is a moving target for every human in existence for every part of their body based on the time of day and year.In other words, I like my sheets dynamic yet reliable. They should be able to insulate me my gently falling above me and around me, only tucking themselves in tightly if I force the issue. Maybe I want to cool my leg, arm, or head down? I should be able to just move a bit or flip my pillow to a spot that hasn\u2019t been warmed by my body. Maybe I want one leg warm and one leg cold? One leg outside the covers totally \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb.Jersey sheets cannot accomplish this feat. Microfiber sheets also cannot accomplish this feat. It\u2019s synthetic, and it\u2019s like a creeping, stifling, too soft carpet that is trying to be too accommodating and creating an inescapable horror \u201ccomfort\u201d where you have no choices. No, Jigsaw. I don\u2019t want to play a game! I just wanted to sleep! Get outta my bed and outta my room!Regular cotton sheets are too loud, too crisp, not soft enough.And then! There is the ecological problem. The thing is, if you find good quality sheets that you like and you take care of them, they\u2019ll last a very, very long time. I paid I think $55 per set for the Kirkland sateen supima cotton sheet sets that I\u2019ve been cycling through for 15+ years. I had 7 sets. I\u2019m down to 4. I\u2019ve purchased a few other sets here and there to try them out. Always the highly rated ones, always after reading loads of reviews. You can probably infer from my comments above how that has turned out this far. The less we consume, the lower carbon footprint we leave. Little choices every day made by all of us adds up. Find a good, quality product and take good care of it. It will prevent you from the need to spend money over and over again.With that said, I have not yet had a chance to sleep in these sheets. They are rayon (synthetic) derived from bamboo. I\u2019m hopeful but not blind. I am also exceedingly objective when it comes to writing reviews. I know what I purchased and I don\u2019t expect them to be sateen. When I do sleep in them, I\u2019ll update.",

I should\u2019ve known by the name \u201cbutter\u201d that they would look more yellow, but in the pictures they looked very beige. It\u2019s still a nice color though, and matches well with my green comforter. Ultimately I am satisfied with this purchase.",
