It does seem breathable.I thought the whole outside was 100% cotton, but after re-reading the description, it appears to be microfiber on the top and cotton on the underside.It\u2019s light and fluffy. As some mentioned, it does have some wrinkles, but I imagine that fluffing it in the dryer will help.I have a question out regarding if the stuffing will shift when washing. I haven\u2019t tested that yet.The color is perfect. I had been searching for a beautiful rust color and this is it!",

                "reviewText": "Let's be clear, this is a very economical choice for a comforter, and you should not expect it to be completely perfect.Pros- The filling is very soft and lightweight- Creates a great cozy feeling- The color (I bought sage green) is true to the images- The king size does actually cover a king bed, however it does not drape all the way to the ground like the pictures display it, but it does come about halfway down to the floor on all sides, which for me having an 18-inch mattress, puts it where it hits right at the beginning of my dust ruffle, so it works out- It does seem to repel pet hair, I have two cats with lots of white fur that sleep with us every night and it doesn't seem to be collecting it- King size fits in my top load washing machine, no need to pay to have it launderedCons- Even after washing, it is still wrinkly from the vacuum packing not sure how long it will take for those to come out- If you are a hot sleeper, this will not be good for you outside of Fall and Winter- While the fabric may be pet hair resistant, I think that is because the topside material is not extremely soft, it kind of reminds me of a windbreaker or nylon material, when you rub it together it makes a noise, it is not uncomfortably rough or anything, but it is not lamb soft, just have to decide if pet hair or softness is a bigger priorityOverall, I am happy with this purchase for the price! I would recommend it. My biggest hang-up is the wrinkles, hopefully they come out soon.",

It doesn\u2019t even have a tag saying what it\u2019s made of. Only thing that says it\u2019s cotton is on the website. I thought it was illegal to sell anything without revealing contents.

                "reviewText": "First, this comforter is nice looking, looks as it does online, except it is very wrinkled. I put the comforter in the dryer, and some of the wrinkles came out, but not all. I washed the pillow cases, put them in the dryer, and the wrinkles still did not come out. The other issue is that I do not believe the underside of the comforter is 100% cotton. The description says the top of the comforter is 70% cotton. Judging by the feel of the material, I think the whole thing is perhaps a 50% cotton blend. The label does not state the material. Still, it is a nice weight, is comfortable with my 100% cotton sheet, so I am keeping it. The price was really good. I have a Queen size bed, and I ordered the king. It's a perfect size. I would recommend, despite the \"cotton\" question.",
