Finally I saw this inexpensive basic 100% cotton (I don't do synthetics) cover and ordered it in two colors I thought I'd like. PERFECT! I washed everything first because it had been sprayed with a shipping pesticide. Washed it first in cold with vinegar and detergent and then a 2nd time in hot water with detergent. After drying the oder was gone. There was no fading of the fabric and the fit is perfect. It's a linen fabric feel and looks great. I'm keeping both colors!",

It\u2019s gorgeous. It\u2019s rich. It\u2019s exactly what I was looking for to pair with my sand colored linen quilt from QUINCE. It is so hard to get a picture that does the color justice. It has just the right amount of wrinkles and has 8 ties to secure it in place. I bought the queen size and paired it with a KING size duvet insert to make it appear fuller and fluffier. I can\u2019t keep the dog from getting underneath it and the cat from getting on top of it. It makes my bed so, so inviting and cozy.

I haven\u2019t washed it yet so will have to see how it holds up. Not quite linen like but close enough.

The fabric is breathable, making it an excellent set for those fresh summer nights. In the winter, I like to switch the duvet inside for a warmer one and it works greatly. Although it isn't 100% wrinkle-free, this set is not excessively wrinkly. I think the light wrinkling makes it look very cute. I got my set in the sage color, and it is the perfect shade of green for an earthy-vibe room.",
