                "reviewText": "I purchased the burnt orange color and queen size! I am one of those shoppers that only buy things with good reviews but then never leaves the review on quality stuff\ud83d\ude02This comforter set DESERVES a review! I have always been on the cheaper side of comforters because I know my dogs will rip/get it dirty in the matter of 6 months. So I stay between 30-50$ and that\u2019s usually just the comforter and 2 shams.Ok, enough about me.This set is great. It comes with all the bedding you need for 54$! I assumed it wouldn\u2019t be soft and fluffy because of the price and usually bed in a bag sheet sets are rough/cheap feeling. These sheets ARE NOT like that. They aren\u2019t \u201camazing\u201d and super thick BUT they are soft and you can\u2019t even tell the thickness (again, I\u2019m not a picky person when it comes to blankets/sheets). I washed and dried it all before putting on too, not sure if that\u2019s what did it. The comforter comes out of a small box and I was like oh no, I bought the duvet not comforter. Nope! It was the comforter. After washing and drying, it fluffed right up!!! It is perfectly warm but did not make me sweat. I ALWAYS sweat at night and that\u2019s why I hate comforters and usually just use throw blankets. This comforter is perfect! I did not sweat!!!!! I was amazed.If this set came in more colors, I\u2019d be so happy and buying only this set!!!Great set, great price!!! DO IT. Trust me, I never leave reviews. So this is a sign to make you get this!!! :) you won\u2019t be disappointed",
