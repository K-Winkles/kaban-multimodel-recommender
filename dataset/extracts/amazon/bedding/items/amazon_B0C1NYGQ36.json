Peachier, salmon pink rather than a blush pink. cute color. picture does not do it justice.",

I got the queen size, I usually size up for the added length but they tend to be very heavy. This will keep you very warm too so its durable in that sense. The pillows in the video did not come with the set, just the comforter and 2 ruffled pillow cases (fyi)",
