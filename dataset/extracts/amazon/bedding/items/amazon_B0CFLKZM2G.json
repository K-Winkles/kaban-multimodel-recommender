The picture is deceiving on that. But, I was not looking for that. I wanted something simple and elegant, but had more to it than the stitched squares of a somewhat typical solid comforter. I would say this is a medium-weight comforter. The material is not see-through. Fits my queen bed very well. A couple of fuzzy euro pillows and a leather square pillow will dress this up with all the different textures.",
