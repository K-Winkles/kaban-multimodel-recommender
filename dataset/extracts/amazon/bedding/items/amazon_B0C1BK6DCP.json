They make putting your sheets away very convenient they come with cards so you can write down exactly what it is you\u2019re putting inside of them so you can see from the outside of the window, I had no idea that my comforter could actually fit inside of one of them as well. I folded my comforter up and it was able to store my huge comforter away so these are a plus for me. it makes it very easy to put your sheets away and see exactly what you\u2019re looking at before you take them out. the quality is amazing and it\u2019s a plus for me.

Easy to use, I love the little clear display window so you can see what set is in there and there is plenty of room for a lot of sheets. Also it's a great space saver if you have limited space, I had my sheets in baskets before and now I have extra space to store other things with all the room it has saved. I bought an additional set because I loved them so much.",

One of the zippers was broken though when I opened up but that\u2019s the only downfall.",

The zipper is very stiff. You need to soap the zipper and go slow so it doesn't jam. The velcro is not sewn on super well. I expect they will come off soon.The boxes were a decent price and they did the trick. I am not sure what other products are like. I would use these again for spare items but not for anything I am in at least once a week. I am thinking of getting more for craft projects. It would be nice to pull 'project' off the shelf and go.",
