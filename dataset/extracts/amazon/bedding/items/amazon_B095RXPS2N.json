The Sleepbella comforter fits the measurements we described and it should be noted that the tufted chevron pattern is vertical, if opposite, may cause width issues. You just need to switch directions to solve the size problem. Why the comforter is thinner than described? As the comforter set is stored in the compression packaging for several months, it may become thin and wrinkled. Please wash and dry before use, after washing the wrinkles will disappear and the filling will be fluffy. What if the product I receive has a quality problem? Thank you for choosing Sleepbella, if you have any idea about the product, please feel free to let us know. We will try our best to make you satisfied.",

Not a very big deal but not able to tuck in to the bed .I love how soft and comfy I feel as my bed is made . Makes the bed feel and look nice . The color of the sheet is as shown in the picture . I'd definitely buy it again, just wish there was more length to it .It is very warm , so if you are a hot sleeper like me you will be covering and uncovering you all night !!! I feel like the comforter is made well for the money . It is very soft to the touch , the pillow cases seem a bit light in feel but also pretty soft . The comforter washed well , and dried well on low heat .",
