                "reviewText": "i bought one of these for my mom's house in florida (up north - it was in the 30s-60s F) and call it the \"luxury blanket\" bc it's so soft and comfortable and cozy. when i went to visit her and used this blanket, that was the first time in a long time i had a full night's sleep. i thought it must be the different bed or the brighter sun regulating my circadian rhythym.and even though i have plenty of blankets, i insisted upon buying this one for our home in ny bc i loved it so much in florida. my hsband protested because we have so many blankets (weighted, crochet, faux fur, down, wool) but ididnt care. this one is special.when i came back to ny, my sleep once again reurned to being beyond abysmal. up in the middle of the night, kicking off sheets, freezing cold, then hot. up for hours in the middle of the night, every night. torture. *our heat isn't working right now, to add to the fun. i ordered the blanket bc i missed how good i felt with it in florida, figuring at least i could feel the softness again. the blanket arrived and i was glad to have that luxury feeling again buti didn not expect what was to happen.i slept with it last night and woke up at 6.30 am like a normal person - i slept the entire night through wihout waking up once!!!!!!! it's a miracle. and it's JUST bc of this blanket - i guess it regulated my temperature perfectly. we literally have no heat right now and it kepy me warm but not too warm - just perfect. it's lightweight, thin, not heavy, just perfect. and so so so very soft.i am going to buy a smaller version for hpostial stays or being on a train, and now my husband wants another one for our other bed. that's a miracle in and of iself because he never wants to buy anything. i did look at other colors and real review pics and i see the orange and burgundy in real life are not as pictured, so i would recommend you look at real review pics. i got th lightblue one and it IS as picured, and next may get yellow.i havent washed this and dont know how it will hold up in the wash. but i will say i feel so, so, grateful to be able to sleep at night without constabtly kicking sheets on and off. literally bc of this blanket, i slept well for the first night and will be able to function during the day again. i had assumed my lack of sleep was bc my bed isn't as comfrtable as the one in florida, but i was wrong. it was the blankets i had (and i tried all of them) not regulating my body temperature.",

It was also a decent weight to layer, not too heavy and very soft. I like to have several blanket options that I can use together or if some are in the laundry. This is not so heavy that I can\u2019t wash it in my own washer and dryer, which is also really important. The only negative is that it does leave red fuzz on things, but after it is washed several more times that should dissipate. Overall, I highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "The company sent me my blanket in a box that was marked the wrong color. It said it was Rose Pink when I ordered another color. I immediately put in a return for the wrong item and asked for a replacement.When I got to were I was going to tape the part of the box that ripped open during shipping and print out the shipping label to ship it back. I took the time to rip open the box a little more to peer inside the box to see if the blanket was the color I actually ordered. It turned out weirdly it was the color of the blanket I ordered. So I canceled the return and the replacement.When I opened the blanket when I got home it was so soft, thin, and nice feeling I was worried it could not keep me warm as I slept. As it turns out when I slept with it last night. I felt warm, covered even though it felt like the blanket was not there, and I could not feel my commercial fan blowing on me through the blanket(This surprised me due to how thin the blanket is). I had a wonderful night's sleep with it.This review is from only after having and using the blanket for one night. In the event something changes or the blanket does not last long. I will update the review with the new information and time owned.Shipping 4 out of 5 stars due to box label saying the blanket was not the correct color I ordered. They could of marked the box that the correct color was in it.Product 5 out of 5 stars due to it performing exactly how I expected it to perform.",

This arrived on time and in great condition.The blanket is better than described. It is the perfect length if you are taller and despite being light it can keep you incredibly warm.It washes very well on regular and even after multiple washes it still looks and feels amazing. Overall this was an excellent purchase and I\u2019d highly recommend it to anyone that likes soft and comfortable blankets.",
