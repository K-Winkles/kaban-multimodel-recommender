Super soft and fluffy.2. Great length/ width (bed is queen, but I ordered a king so it would hang over the sides and at the foot)3. I did not see any random strings at the seams, so seems to be well made.4. True to color.5. Nice and warm. This comforter is thick and lying under it felt like sleeping under a cloud.6. Great price for what you get (love that it comes with pillowcases)I'm sure I will order more in different colors. I recommend!",

The color looks nice and matches the photos. It\u2019s easy to wash and I don\u2019t notice any quality issues as far as threads coming undone or anything of the sort. It\u2019s also very light weight it doesn\u2019t weigh down my feet while I sleep which has been a big problem for other comforters/blankets. I don\u2019t wake up with a ton of pain in my ankles. It\u2019s also been fine for my husband who is a hot sleeper! And as the temperatures drop it is still warm enough to keep us comfortable. Overall very happy and will most likely buy more sets for our kids.",

                "reviewText": "My husband and I had been arguing because he says (it could be a rumour, idk, I'm asleep haha) I steal the covers on our Cali king bed. We live in NE Florida so it's \"cold\" for us here (50 degrees F or less...I know, don't hate me, I'm from Wyoming and being cold SUCKS!) so we both needed some blanket. The last straw was when I had fully entangled myself in the blanket and he had to use our dog's extra blanket to stay warm. :( I felt awful and took the task to Amazon. The comforter is SO soft and the pillowcases are soft, the stitching is nice and the color is pretty (we got the grayish blue set).The only, and I mean ONLY negative: it's a little hot under there. I saw a previous review and it did say it is not for summer, it's a pretty warm blanket. I can fully attest to that. My husband has felt fine and comfortable, but I've woken up the past 2 nights completely soaked in sweat, I won't go into detail because it's a bit TMI, but so much so that I honestly thought I may have wet the bed! :D For the record, I did NOT pee the bed, it's just hot under there.So, in summation, I highly recommend this comforter set. It will keep you warm, and it's sooooo soft! I wish it was a bit more thin but I'll figure out how to make it work for us.The winning point: it completely covers our Cali king bed and we have had the blanket bandit has not made an appearance (so far). It's very big, which if you have a king or Cali king, you know most blankets aren't quite big enough (that's what she said). Enjoy!",

So the next night I slept with only this blanket and I STILL woke up sweating. Finally, on the third night, I realized I could snuggle within this blanket with thin pajamas (even in winter) and be cozy.I want three more in different colors so I can change them out according to the season! I'll probably buy my next color in the spring.",
