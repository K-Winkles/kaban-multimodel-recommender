Wanted something lightweight and easy to wash, and this works perfectly. The sage color and design/embossing looks really nice. I considered ordering a king instead of queen, just because some queen sizes often seem too short on the sides, but this one in queen size fit great and provides the right amount of length on all sides. Great price, happy with this item.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This is my the second one I have ordered. I liked this coverlet so much, I purchased a second one. I love that this is much thinner than a traditional quilt, comforter or duvet. It is more substantial than having just a sheet on you, but much lighter and cooler than a comforter or quilt. Great for summer weather. Both of my orders were for the twin size and so they fit easily into my standard size washer and dryer. Each order included the quilt and one matching pillow sham. I think it mentions coming with 2 pillow shams, but I only received one sham on each order. I love the detailing on this quilt. The pattern looks like some intricate tile mosaic one might see at the Alhambra in Spain. Its incredible how much detailing and texture there is in this quilt. I also like that it is super soft\u2014incredibly soft like something at a very expensive hotel. Super quality. Went through the washer and dryer with no problem. I would not hesitate to recommend this to a friend. Wish it came in more color choices like caramel.",
