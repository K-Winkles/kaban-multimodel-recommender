It is very soft (especially after washing). It is very, very thin - about the thickness of two sheets quilted together. However, that is what I was looking for, I wanted something soft and pretty to put over my existing comforter that would be easier and lighter to clean more frequently than a bulky comforter (I have cats who love to sleep on my bed during the day and so this was a constant issue before now.) I bought this in both grey and also white. Both are of equal quality and function. I was going to rotate them out but with how thin they are it actually works to just layer them and make a nice folded look when making the bed. Having them both on did not make it noticeably warmer at night either. For the price point I am very satisfied with the product as a supplemental use to my existing bedding.",

If that's what you want, great. I am confused by the \"quilting,\" which is not stitched at all, just \"pressed\" or \"heat applied.\" Wonder how that feature will hold up in the wash. Overall, a decent buy.",

I agree with the other reviewers definitely size up, I ordered the Kingsize for a double bed, it\u2019s long but not as wide as it should be, it is nicely made and amazing value with the matching pillow cases too. It\u2019s lightweight but ideal for warmer nights when a duvet isn\u2019t needed. Perfect for making the bedroom look smart, I\u2019m very happy to recommend this Moonlight brand quilted throw. I wish it came in purple too as I\u2019d definitely buy another.",
