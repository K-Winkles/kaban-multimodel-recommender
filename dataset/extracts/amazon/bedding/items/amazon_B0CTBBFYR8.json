The shams are simple, much like a pillow case, but for the quality of the set and the very reasonable price they're fine.",

It fits both of my king sized down blankets perfectly, I love that there's ties in the corners, and y'all, the color... omg... LOVE. I was looking for something to add some subtle color to my otherwise very neutral bedroom. It's this soft dusty mauve color that adds a warm, almost gothic vibe. Super romantic color. Couldn't be happier! Buy the thing!*The product is as described and came in the time stated.**Update: I forgot to mention that it washed beautifully. The color held, didn't fade and it softened the fabric more than I figured it would in one wash. Subtle wrinkling, nothing major. You definitely don't have to break out the iron for it if you don't want. It actually looks like it's supposed to be that way and it gives the cover a nice textured look. I'm glad too because this girl ain't about to iron a blanket \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I'm over here thinking about buying a color for each season and maybe some holidays lol great purchase",

Granted, I am used to buying $350 duvets, which are really soft, so I expected this duvet to be of lesser quality than what I\u2019m used to since it\u2019s only $59. This is a huge downgrade for me, but I wanted to try something cheaper. It\u2019s true what they say, you get what you pay for!It feels more like a linen texture, although it\u2019s not linen. So it\u2019s not totally soft like what others are saying. But I do like the look. It has a linen look to it, so it\u2019s nicer than just plain solid fabric. I like the textures and it feels durable. It was easy to put on with the corner ties and zipper, but I wish it was a softer fabric. Let\u2019s see how it holds up after a few more washes... Overall, not bad for the price.",
