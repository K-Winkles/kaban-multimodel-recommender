                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Geniospin King Size Comforter Set, and it's been a great addition to my bedroom. The reversible Boho design with the spliced Aztec pattern in yellow adds a vibrant touch. The 8-piece set provides everything needed for a cohesive look, and the generous size of 102x90 inches ensures ample coverage. The down alternative filling offers comfort without feathers. The only minor downside is that the sheets could be softer, but overall, it's a stylish and well-rounded bedding set for those who appreciate Boho aesthetics.",

                "reviewText": "UPDATE: 07.04.2023I have my review a 4th star. I have not been able to get back in until now, but immediately (probably within a couple hours) of my review, the seller reach out offering to make things right with my order. I didn't take him up on it as I am quite satisfied with the comforter alone. However, it's nice to still find a business who still backs the quality of their products. He very well could have taken my review as another \"opinion\", but he didn't.I bought this set because I wanted something I liked but also was not too \"girly\" for my husband. This also came with shams, a pillow and sheets, so it seemed to meet all my criteria.PROS:- Very soft comforter. Keeps us warm but not to where we are sweating.- Sheets are decent as far a softness goes.- I ordered a size up and the comforter fits great.- Price- Arrived quickCONS:- We ordered a California king for our king size bed. The comforter fits great (a king would've been way too small). However, the sheets do NOT fit. Even ordering a size up, they do not cover our 10\" mattress.- The sheets came with a hole in them. Kind of a waste to order this set because it came with sheets... if the sheets have a hole.- the shams are not \"sham material\" but are actually pillow cases. They still work but not what I expected.- The black pillow is small and flat. I wish there had been a zipper so I could put another pillow in there but not a huge deal for me.You get what you pay for. All in all it's really not bad. I would have given it another star if the sheets weren't ripped.",

It fits great length wise on our king bed, however it does not fit width wise, leaving alot of the mattress itself and the fitted sheet showing. The fitted sheet and too sheet are both plenty big enand look great. The pockets on the fitted sheet where a nice surprise. The pillow cases the go with the sheets as well as the ones that go with the comforter are HUGE. You could easily put two pillows in one pillow case. We will definitely keep the sheets. We will now unfortunately have to look for a new comforter that fits properly. If you like this one make sure to size up when you order just so it's wide enough.",
