I was quite skeptical at first because I originally found this item for $500 on the Belk app, and finding it for $381 less seemed kind of like a scam! But the product got here and after carefully inspecting everything, it\u2019s exactly what it says it is! Just in case there is someone wondering, this item is indeed an actual comforter, not a duvet cover, it has all the stuffing inside of it. Of course you could put this comforter inside of a another duvet cover if you wanted to, but it\u2019s already so pretty. I\u2019m very pleased, this is basically my dream comforter set after recently finally buying my dream bed. I am very pleased, I can confirm it is definitely not a scam even though the price might make you doubtful, and all the measure rd if the pillow cases are accurate, and the comforter is definitely full/queen size if you select the queen size! I am a big fan of this product! I apologize for the comforter being lumpy in the photo, I didn\u2019t notice at the time and didn\u2019t have time to retake it if I had!",

I bought the king size comforter for a couple extra dollars to fit my queen bed because I wanted that traditional flowy, oversized look that Laura Ashley is known for. I have a pillow top mattress so a traditional queen size comforter would be too small. Keep that in mind when ordering any comforter. It arrived a little stiff but I've worn 200.00 boots that were stiff and had to be broken in so give the comforter a week to soften up with use. Easy clean with the tide and go pen or dry cleaner.",
