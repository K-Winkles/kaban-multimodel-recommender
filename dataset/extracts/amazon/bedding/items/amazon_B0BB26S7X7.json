                "reviewText": "The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the thickness of the comforter. I really was hoping for something a little thicker and fluffier, purely for aesthetic reasons, but it is still a very nice comforter set for the price. The material is very soft against my skin and it is keeping me warm now that the temperature has dropped and Canadian winter has finally kicked in. Colour is as shown in the pictures, I chose \"brown\". It's not a rich brown but that was obvious from the product photos. It's more of a soft pastel, dusty kind of brown, which is nice. I usually go with darker colours but I'm trying something new and I'm not disappointed! I really do wish it wasn't so flat looking though, since I'm trying to achieve a nice cozy look. Some more pronounced tufts would probably remedy the fullness issue and bring this comforter to the next level.",
