We have been using this for over a month now and I have not seen one feather escape from the comforter. It is very comfortable in our NorthWest weather which tends to be very damp and in the 40's for most of the winter months. I keep a duvet cover on it all the time so it doesn't get dirty. The only thing I would say is if you don't like any weight on you when you sleep this comforter may not be for you. It does have a medium weight to it.",

I sleep cold, and this keeps me nice and warm, eliminating the need for extra blankets. The weight is great, too! You feel tucked in but not weighed down. Love it so much I bought the same one for my daughter (just a different size) when she wanted a new comforter.",

                "reviewText": "So far this comforter has fluffed up nicely and is quite cozy, but I've found it to be quite hot to sleep with. I tend to be someone who heats up considerably while sleeping and like the room to be chilly bordering on cold, and I still find that I have overheated at night. Two caveats to this: 1) in addition to the comforter I am using a heather cotton set of sheets, which seems like it may be a partial cause of the problem and 2) I have a duvet cover over the duvet (which by the way is very easy to put on) which could also be causing the overheating",

                "reviewText": "Over the last number of weeks, I've really come to like this duvet.The duvet arrived well packaged, not just in a plastic bag like I've seen others, the ridged packaging also keeps it clean while in transport. This is important since if packed too tightly there is a tendency for the down to clump up. That said, even here there was a little clumping but a few good shakes loosened everything right up.We took a good look at how it was made and are pretty happy. The stitching is all well done, we didn't find a single leftover thread sticking out anyplace. The pattern is all exactly the same and corners are well put together. All panels are fitted so that everything lines up.\u25ba Both my wife and I find the material to be very soft and comfortable when it lays up against the face.\u25ba When moved it makes virtually no rustling or any other sound, other than maybe when it comes up against day old bristles on my face.\u25ba It is nice and light. We both down like heavy blankets, especially those weighted ones, and prefer to stay warm without it feeling like a truck parked on top of us.\u25ba We started using it before it really cooled off around here and at night it never really got below 20C in the house. It was too warm but now after the outside temperatures have dropped significantly it's very comfortable, we now keep the house at 18C.\u25ba While the information here lists it as an all-season item it really is too warm for summer and the edge seasons, at least for us.After washing the cover we always give the duvet a good shake to make sure the down and feathers stay fluffy as there are times when a portion gets squished as we roll over in the night.Size-wise, this is a perfect fit (king) and it fits nicely into a cover we've had for some time. We prefer to use covers so that dust, pet hair, and general house dust doesn't get stuck to it.For the price, this is a great buy. I know there are more expensive options out there and I've slept under some of them but I can't think of any reason why I would spend more money. None of the more expensive options have been any softer or more comfortable so why bother?",

Even though the weather is a bit too warm to switch to a duvet cover right now I\u2019ve been sleeping with this duvet and I have to say, I really like the heaviness of it \u2013 it feels remarkably similar to a weighted blanket which is very soothing to me. It kept me warm but not too warm \u2013 I didn\u2019t wake up sweaty. The overall quality seems really nice with strong stitching around the perimeter.This duvet is filled with 60% white goose down and the remaining 40% is white goose feathers. It\u2019s the company\u2019s All Season duvet so it might be comfortable for use all year round, both in frigidly cold winters and stinkin hot summers! I can\u2019t say how well it will keep me warm in the winter yet but for end of summer season use, it\u2019s ideal for me.One of my cats just barfed on it today so I will have to put it through the wash. I\u2019ll let you guys know how it fares!",

                "reviewText": "This duvet is described as for all seasons, but it's too warm for summer use. It's not that we just aren't used to down duvets during the summer, in fact, I swapped out our usual goose down duvet purchased from a major department store (with a much higher MSRP) with this one last night to be able to directly compare them. This duvet gets hot and stuffy where our old one does not nearly as much, somehow. I suppose this would be a plus in the winter but I'm switching back to our old one until at least then.Actual construction of the duvet is not bad but not top of the line either. The stitching throughout all looks good, not sloppy and not weak but the fabric is rather \"stiff\", it doesn't flow as nicely as our old duvet does - though I'm struggling here to come up with a clear way to describe what I mean. The baffles that keep the down evenly distributed in the blanket are there, but they are pretty sparsely distributed so even right away when I held it up to the light you could see that there was some bunching inside. It's not something that is super obvious when in use, though, but more baffles would have been better. Still, at the price point, I think quality is fine - you have to remember this isn't a $400-500 duvet.It does not smell like chemicals - at all. It doesn't come vacuum packed, so it's not compressed - it's just folded in a reusable zippered bag. At the end of the day I think the quality and comfort are fine for what it costs, but just don't expect a luxury experience.",
