My linen closet was a mess with towels and bedding never staying together for very long, requiring complete dismantling and reorganizing nearly ever time I change the linens to find items that match. That ended immediately when I started deploying these bands. I now have a full set of linens ready to go for each bed in the house neatly stored at all times, and the closet itself looks neat and and tidy. I also use these bands to keep my towel sets together, folded and easy to get to. It's no longer a chore requiring pulling out multiple items and sometimes the whole closet when I need something. Small things really do matter.",

                "reviewText": "I like these little bands in general, they are those \"very simple but very useful\" kinds of things. The bands themselves seem pretty well made/sturdy, the color and writing on them is pretty, and overall they do make things look a lot more organized and fancy ish. My biggest problem with them is also my only problem with them - they are fixed in one size and it takes quite a bit to fill that one size. I folded and wrapped up 3 sets of sheets (all Queen size) and only one of the sets fit well in the band, which had a fitted sheet, larger top sheet, and 4 pillow cases. If all of your sets are like that, then the size of these will probably work well for you. But if you have anything less (like sets with only 2 pillow cases) or a fabric that is a little denser when folded (like satin type sheets) then you're probably going to run into the same problem I did - and either have your stuff barely held together at all OR having to find other pillow cases/etc to shove in there to get more of a tight fit. I went with the latter option and even then (with one set) there was still way too much room for the strap to work very effectively. I wound up just putting a second band on that set to give it a better chance of being held together.If they had like a few sets of eye hooks, like on a bra, so that you could loosen or tighten a bit, I would like these a lot lot more. But overall they are cute/helpful and for the price for them is very fair.Shipping and delivery was done in a timely manner, received them 2 days after ordering them.",
