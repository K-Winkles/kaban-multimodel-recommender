Ordered a heavier comforter for $80.00. It kept us warm but had a Polyester outer shell that bothered my wife's allergies. Tried a 3rd time. We bought the Utopia Bedding Comforter with a $30 discount coupon. It's has a a Feather Down fill with box stitching and a cotton outer shell. Perfect. A great deal and a great price. I would recommend this comforter. Don S.",

For the last few years, I have a small twin blanket and bed blanket is my husbands (that also goes over me and my blanket). With this blanket, I can move all I want AND wrap myself up in this blanket and it doesn't bother my husband at all. ALSO!! This is such a great blanket. It is super light weight, but nice and warm. It is so soft, it is almost too hard to get out of bed in the morning because how happy I am with the blanket. I know it sounds crazy, but it is the best blanket I have ever owned. I love it so much that I just bought a queen size blanket for our bed so my husband can enjoy the blanket love as well. Hope this help you make your choice. I got the dark grey for my blanket and the bed blanket. LOVE",
