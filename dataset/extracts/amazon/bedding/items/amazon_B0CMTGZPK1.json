You get the comforter, 2 sheets, the fitted and straight, 2 pillow cases and 2 matching shams. The sheets are fairly soft and comfortable although in not sure what the actual thread count is but I would believe it's on the lower side based on the feel. The comforter is true to size for the king set that I got however it is rather thin and not as soft as I would like. I will be curious to see how this holds up to several washes over time but do far the construction and stitching seem adequate. Deducting the one star for the softness and comfortable factor of both the sheets and comforter, otherwise this is a very cost effective set.",

I would recommend also adding sheet clips for use on adjustable beds. The sheets tended to start \"crawling up\" the mattress at the corners when bed is raised to the upright position. The comforter is nice and lightweight, that will be able to be used in the warmer months as well. During the colder months, pairing it with a blanket works well. The color is what was pictured and I appreciate that. These are easy to wash and dry; in dryer or line drying.This is a great bedding set at an affordable price.",

                "reviewText": "Beautiful COMPLETE Bed-in-a-bag!!This set has:~2 Sheets 1 Fitted 1 Flat~2 Pillow Cases that match the sheets~1 Comforter~2 Shams that match the comforter!The threading is spectacular! I say this as I have paid comparable prices for name-brand, only sheet sets years ago.And I expect them to last and last and last!You spend 1/3 of your life asleep- literally! This is a very important part of your overall health. I see this as an investment in my health, so I was skeptical when I saw an WHOLE bedset for such a great overall price!!And even more tickled then I received it and realized that is is actually a comforter!! NOT a Duvet- which is what I was expecting!This is am excellent set! At an amazing price for what you receive!!The sheets and their matching pillowcases are adorable!They're a pail cream color that leans closer to an off white with soft green diamonds that match the included comforter and pillow shams!These feel so smooth and soft to lay down on!The comforter is a lovely 'distressed'/'farmhouse' patterned Soft greens.There are two pillow shams that match the comforter, as well!The comforter comes in a vacuum sealed bag. Toss it into the dryer on a low setting for about 15 minutes to 'fill' it back out.The material feels the same as the sheets; soft and smooth to the touch. After sleeping in the warm and cozy soft bedding I am impressed!!This would make a GREAT gift to anyone that loves to get a good nights sleep!This is a very beautiful 'Ben-in-a-Bag' for a GREAT price!This is such a practical and transformative bedding set!!I HIGHLY Recommend this Bed-in-a-Bag to ANYONE that likes a great night of sleep!!",

                "reviewText": "I honestly was taken away by the quality and softness of this bedding set, super impressed. There were a few loose stings on the shams but nothing too major. Our cats did get to the sheets after I washed them the first time and caused a run down the fitted sheet but they did not get worse or run more when washed multiple times afterwards. The comforter is vacuum sealed and fluffs out easily once we threw it in the dryer with some wool dryer balls and a damp hand towel. I mainly got the set because of the advertised deep pocket sheet and while they are indeed deep and cover our entire mattress, they still sometimes get come undone. Highly recommend sheet clips if you have that issue. The sheets and comforter are on the thinner side which will make it easy to transition to warmer months, currently we need an extra blanket underneath the comforter to stay nice and toasty.",

                "reviewText": "When we received the bedding I noticed the stitching was very loose, not like you would expect for bedding. I washed the bedding to be able to use it right away and there were loose thread coming out all the way around the comforter. The fitted sheet does not fit snuggly on the mattress as the description suggests.It is light weight and the colors are good.May keep it and just know I will have to mend it soon.I hope this review helps someone else not to be surprised upon receiving this product.",
