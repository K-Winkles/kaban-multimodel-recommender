But I was surprised to find that it's actually very warm and more comfortable than my old heavy comforter. It was wrinkled from being packaged, but I put it in the dryer on low and the wrinkles came out easily. The pattern and colors are beautiful. The sewing is good (no loose threads or unsewn edges). The fabric seems a little on the thin side, so I hope it holds up. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase.",

I really like the floral tree print which is what I think caught my eye with this product. I completely overlooked the fact that this is made of microfiber when I prefer cotton. With that being said, it is soft and feels smooth and cozy against my skin. It's not bad.Overall, I think this is a solid low-to-medium range choice for a comforter set.

                "reviewText": "I'm a big fan of the 'Bed in a Bag' concept. So I jumped on this and ordered this Botanical Comforter Set in Queen.This set consists of: One comforter, one fitted sheet, one flat sheet, two pillowcases, and two pillow shams. The shams and cases have an envelope-style end, which I personally prefer. The tag states that the material is 100% polyester.The comforter has a very pretty print, although it does feel a bit thin. It is shiny, and not particularly soft by my personal definition. Time will tell how much it softens up, or if the filling balls up in the individual little pockets of the comforter. I was able to wash the comforter in my standard sized washing machine and so far, it didn't fall apart, or lose the filling, like many similar products have.The sheets softened a bit, but they still have this strange satin-like sheen to them, that I don't usually associate with 'microfiber' bedding. Usually it's a softened appearance, and a bit less slippery feeling. They are also a bit thin, so I think I'll be more likely to rotate them in during the spring and summer months.My mattress is a deep, pillow top, and on top of that I have a 3\" memory foam mattress pad. The fitted sheet is a big snug, (which I knew to expect) and the corners do tend to slip, (like nearly every single fitted sheet I have... don't get me started, lol) but that too. I would easily have added a star if these had corner elastic straps.Overall, this sheet set is very pretty, and satiny, and would be very comfortable in non-winter months. I will definitely use the set during the spring and summer.",
