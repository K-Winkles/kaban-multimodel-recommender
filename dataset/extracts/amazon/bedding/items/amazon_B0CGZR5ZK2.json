These aren\u2019t exactly soft, I wouldn\u2019t consider them that. They\u2019re more like\u2026.silky? But not so much so that you\u2019re sliding all over the bed. Also, the design on the comforter and pillows is subtle enough that I can present it to a man and he not feel like it\u2019s too feminine which is a problem I\u2019ve run into in the past.

It\u2019s currently winter so we will layer another blanket on top or it would be way too cold. I love how classic and simple it looks. Great for a guest bedroom since it would match many decor styles. I\u2019d recommend this as a budget friendly bedding option just keep his thin it is in mind.",

                "reviewText": "The comforter turned out much thinner than expected, and the pillowcases are also on the thin side. I was hoping that putting it in the dryer would fluff it up, but it didn't do much. It's definitely on the lighter side. While the design grid adds some style, the flat pinch pleated lines settle in different directions. Had it been sewn with some nice solid piping, it would've made it look much neater. It's not at all breathable, making me have the urge to reach out for my other premium comforter. Even after 1.5 months of use with multiple wash and drying cycles as instructed, the fabric hasn't softened much, instead its flattened, and the filling has shifted and clumped. On top of that, the fabric started to pill, making it uncomfortable. I probably won't be using it anymore.",
