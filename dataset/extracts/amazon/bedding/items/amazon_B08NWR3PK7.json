                "reviewText": "****This is my update. Originally I gave this product 1 star, and because of their excellent customer service I have changed my review to 4 stars. After my review the company reached out to me and told me that they would refund my money in full and I did not need to send my comforter back. I waited a few days before updating this review to make sure that they did in fact refund my money and they have. So even though I now have to buy another comforter I am happy with the customer service I received. I hope that my comforter was just a fluke and that other people purchasing from this company end up satisfied with their purchase. \ud83d\ude01I bought this comforter for my son for Christmas. I knew that it had arrived so I never took it out of the box. Well he unwrapped it, and through the shrink wrap there was a oder like garlic or an ethnic restaurant. Once it was taken out of the shrink wrap the smell was overwhelming. I tried to let it air out, but my entire upstairs bed rooms all smell like this now. I decided to wash it in hopes that the smell would go away. I have now washed it 2 times with fabric beads to help cover the smell and it is not going away. I feel like this may have been a used comforter and I\u2019m not sure if it was kept in a kitchen while meals were being fried, but the smell is awful. There was no photo or original packaging, just the shrink wrapped product. I would like my money back, and find a new/ smell free comforter, but not sure if they will let me return a comforter that has already been washed several times. Money down the drain! Not happy and WOULD NOT recommend purchasing from this company.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this set sort of on a whim, for my 12 yr old son to freshen up his room a bit. I stumbled across this set and the colors matched his existing throw pillow, and curtains, and for $38 after applying a coupon I though why not, and submitted my order.The comforter and shams arrived the next day, the packaging was very small so I was a little concerned that the comforter was going to be super thin, but after washing and drying it, it\u2019s fluffed up like crazy and is just a perfect mid weight comforter he can use year round, that is also super soft.I am thrilled with my purchase and my son also is very happy with his new bedding. This is seriously one of the best finds I have gotten off of Amazon as far as quality and price. Definitely buy this set, you will not be disappointed!",

                "reviewText": "Overall it looks nice, but the item was in a very small vacuumed sealed bag and when opened it was so wrinkly. It never filled out or got thick. (There was no instructions saying it would, I just assumed with all the other vacuumed sealed stuff it would fill out some). It is extremely light weight. It is 2 pieces of fabric with maybe a thin piece of batting inside. Good for summer but I would not recommend it for winter months. The fabric is not cotton, it's a silky feeling poly blend type fabric. The design is printed on the blanket it is not patches/sections sewn like it seems. I like it over all but it slides off the bed and probably will not hold up with multiple washings. I would think this is slightly over priced for the quality at the $40 price point. This is more like a $20 price point at one of the chain stores.",

The only drawback I have is that it's so slippery, it tends to slip off one side of the bed during the night. I've washed it several times hoping to remedy that, but it didn't work. Other than that, it's a beautiful comforter and definitely worth the price.",
