                "reviewText": "The 6 PC California King Sheet Set made from Rayon Bamboo has redefined my sleep experience, offering a luxurious feel and a host of benefits that go beyond just comfort.What immediately stands out is the material \u2013 rayon made from bamboo. The sheets have a silky-smooth texture that feels incredibly soft against the skin. It's a game-changer for those who appreciate the finer things in bedding. The sheets also have a natural sheen that adds a touch of elegance to the bed.Beyond the luxurious feel, the sheets boast impressive moisture-wicking properties. They keep me cool and comfortable throughout the night, making them ideal for warm evenings. This breathability has significantly improved the quality of my sleep, allowing me to wake up feeling refreshed.The California King size provides ample coverage, ensuring the sheets fit perfectly on the bed without any tugging or slipping. The deep pockets and elasticized edges contribute to a snug fit, even on thicker mattresses.One remarkable experience was during a particularly hot summer night. The sheets' moisture-wicking ability kept me cool, creating a comfortable sleeping environment that made a noticeable difference in the quality of my rest.",

They fit my bed perfectly and does not pull up or comes loose from my deep mattress. I bought the Ivory and I find it is more like a pale gold than Ivory. I still love them and would buy again in different color if available. It is always hard to judge the correct color when ordering on line. I always prefer how my sheets feel then how they fit over the exact color match... Yes I would definitely recommend these sheets and be sure to measure your pockets to ensure a great fit.",
