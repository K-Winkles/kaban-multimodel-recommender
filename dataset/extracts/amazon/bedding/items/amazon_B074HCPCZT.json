They also are easy to clean in dorm washing machines because it isn't too bulky. They are a super nice material and almost silky. However, I will say they do happen to get very staticky, so I would maybe just use dryer sheets to help with that. Overall, super nice bedding set for dorm life.",

                "reviewText": "First, I'd like to say that my review is based off what I paid vs what I received. If I had paid $250 for this, it would be a 3 or 4 star review. But for $65~ for a king set, this is as good as it gets. I'm a firm believer in getting what you pay for, but based on the reviews and price point, I pulled the trigger, without much to lose here. I must say, compared to my old $200~ set I had from a big box stores, this bed set flat out wins in every head to head category. If you're looking for something extremely heavy and warm, this may not be for you. It is relatively lightweight, and oh-so soft. For it's weight, it is surprisingly warm, to the point of having to uncover my feet at night to regulate my sleeping temperature. Those extra heavy and warm comforters are just not for me, I don't enjoy sweating in my sleep. This set keeps me at the perfect temperature and is heavenly to touch.My wife wasn't incredibly happy with me when I told her that I had ordered this on my own, without her opinion or input. But I had already known that she would've immediately dismissed it as an option based off the price, thinking we would have to spend at least a couple hundred for an adequate bed set. Needless to say, this bed brought me one of those rare marital moments where my wife reluctantly admitted that I was right, and was even gloating about my choice of color. The dark blue/taupe combination is simply beautiful. Do not hesitate, click add to cart immediately!",

                "reviewText": "I originally bought a set of 2 fitted sheets by Bare. I loved them so much that I bought a full set! The fabric is sooo incredibly soft and pleasant to the touch. Lightweight but have held up well over 6 months and ongoing. The sheets and comforter wash well, dry quickly, and don't wrinkle much at all if removed somewhat promptly from the dryer. Comforter is more on the lightweight side of things. Perfect for all but the coldest Canadian winter nights! Keeps me warm but also not sweaty. This set is a great value and I would recommend or buy as a gift.",
