            "\u3010Stylish Stripe Design\u3011As the weather gets warmer, it's time to choose a quilt that is breathable and comfy. Unlike other single-color quilts, Litanika quilt is a patchwork of classic stripes in green, grey, and white, retaining a traditional look while maintaining a contemporary vibe. These vibrant and timeless colors complement each other well to give elegance to your room while enhancing the d\u00e9cor with a crisp look. What a treat to wake up to such a light bedspread every day.",
            "\u3010Soft and Durable\u3011Litanika king quilt bedding set is filled with even higher-quality materials for added comfort. The inner microfiber has been made tighter and smoother through technology, resulting in a fluffier filling that is more cushioned and supportive and less likely to distort over time.The seemingly random quilting alignment gives the cover a more polished appearance, but the filling is evenly distributed inside the quilt to ensure warmth and comfort, as well as greater durability.",
            "\u3010Multi-Purpose Usage\u3011 Our patchwork quilt is appropriate for use all year, giving comfort in hot times and additional warmth on cold days. It keeps you warm without causing the stress that other comforters will bring. Because of its outstanding breathability, you can sleep soundly without being troubled by sweat even in hot summer. You can enjoy it while watching TV, taking a nap, or enjoying outdoor activities. Also, you could use it for any cabin like a lake house, mountain house, or cottage.",
            "\u30103 Pieces Quilt Set\u3011Litanika king quilt set contains a striped patchwork quilt measuring 106\" x 96\" and two matching pillowcases measuring 20\" x 36\". Adopts advanced sewing technology and neat and strong stitches, making Litanika coverlet set more durable than those ultrasonic printing quilts. Features sturdy stitched design in both sides, ensuring an even distribution of filling without bunching or moving.",
            "\u3010Wash Care\u3011Carefully crafted green quilt is made to withstand multiple washings. Litanika advises machine washing in cold water on a gentle cycle. Tumble dry with low heat or air drying. Do not bleach or iron, please.. Due to the use of vacuum packaging, before first use, it is strongly recommended to place the quilt in the sun for further exposure and lightly pat it a few times so that it will be more fluffy and soft. Contact us at any time if you have any questions."
