                "reviewText": "These guys do a great job of holding on to the fitted sheet. That is, they snap on like some suspenders from the '80s and they stay connected to the fitted sheet where you snapped them on. In my case, they didn't really do a lot to stop the fitted sheet from twisting. If you think about it like your mattress is a cylinder and the fitted sheet is 3/4 of a tube that can spin around the cylinder, these things basically make it like a complete tube. It still can spin around, there's just more of it. I know that's a really weird way of explaining it but.. if there was some sort of gripping it grippy material where the parts come together it would probably function a bit better than it does.Otherwise, they seem very well built and strong and the clips are really good at what they do.",

Super easy to use, even by yourself, and damn do they work!We are toss and turn all night, now we don't have to worry about fixing the sheets come morning.

I actually had a set of sheets that had the elastic very thick and they did not hold very well with these sheets. Had to use my old school ones that I already had .Unfortunately, that was the main reason I bought them. However, I did keep them because I used it for my mattress protector and it holds semi well. They don't stay in place but the Protector doesn't come out of place. I still have to adjust it and pull them in place every time I change the sheets. Buy it at your own discretion.",

                "reviewText": "I have numerous sheets from over the years, hand me downs from mom and some have shallow contour pockets. Without barely lifting the mattress these clip on in three outer places and slide over the corner. The clip is a bit difficult to open but thats good because you don't want it pulling off the sheet. Very pleased.",
