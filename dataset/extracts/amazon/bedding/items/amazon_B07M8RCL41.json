I was under the impression that they were cotton but they are microfiber that's cool but I was looking for natural fibers and without containing silver*(I have enough health issues). these do not have silver in them ... yaaay... I don't think they are as thin as some reviewer have said. but they are light, nice and soft and fit my queen 12\" memory foam bed... the bottom sheet stays put and hasn't slipped off... the set come with standard pillow cases they have a nice trim on them they wash nicely and no wrinkles and dries quickly. I got the dark purple (ie. eggplant) it is a lovely color. I will be buying a few more sets soon maybe in the lime green*note (silver exposure can be toxic and may lead to liver and kidney damage, irritation of the eyes, skin, respiratory, and intestinal tract, and changes in blood cells. nih web site)",

They are lightweight and cooling and feel really smooth and crisp. They are a little thinner than cotton sheets but still feel high quality. I really like the deep pockets too because the fitted sheet doesn\u2019t slide off my mattress which used to drive me crazy. I\u2019ve been using these for a couple months now and they still look and feel brand new. I love the silver color too, it\u2019s perfect. Great affordable option!",

                "reviewText": "i have a very protective malinois that sleeps at the foot of my bed, which means the bottom corners of sheets tend to get a little marled from him climbing up. i've had these for almost a year now, and i've only noticed a tiny bit of fraying in one spot. super soft and smooth, too. if you're buying for a bed adults sleep in, be a bit wary of oil based lubricants - i have a dark color set so it's not too visible, but i can definitely see where it spilled after several washes. otherwise seems to be pretty stain resistant.",
