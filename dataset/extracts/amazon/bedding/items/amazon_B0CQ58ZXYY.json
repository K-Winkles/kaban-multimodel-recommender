THE MATERIAL IS SOFT ON THE SKIN AND DOES NOT IRRITATE OUR SENSITIVE SKIN. IT DOES NOT CAUSE USE TO SWEAT AND VERY COOL TO LAY ON. IT WAS VERY EASY TO PUT ON THE MATTRESS. TWO PEOPLE PUT IT ON WITH NO PROBLEM AT ALL. I AM NOT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SURE IT IS WATER RESISTANT BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT HAD WATER ON IT YET, BUT IT DOES THE JOB OF PROTECTING THE MATTRESS AND KEEPING IT NEW. THAT IS ALL WE WANT.

These beauties blew me away. The fit PERFECTLY and the assembly was beyond simple. It\u2019s rare that a project turns out as I imagined, but this was one for the books. SO pleased with the fit, feel, and price!",

                "reviewText": "To be honest, I was concerned about putting the Cal King cover on the mattress. It does take two people as recommended in the instructions, but even as \"senior citizens\" we were able to quickly cover the mattress. The cover is waterproof and bug proof, but it has a nice feel which will allow the mattress to feel comfortable during the summer. I really like the strong velcro flap that covers the end of the zipper. I am very pleased.",

                "reviewText": "Considering how much you can save by protecting your mattress (from bed bugs, acarians, liquid spills, etc) this is a very good investment at a reasonable price.The zipper is sturdy and conceived for maximum protection including a velcro closure at the end of the zipper. I was worried the PVC interior lining would be noisy (like plastic bed covers) but once installed you don't hear any crispy sound. It's just like a polyester cover, no plastic-y sensation.As per washing instructions on the packaging you can machine wash and tumble dry at low heat which is amazing since there is PVC inside ( I was afraid I would need some kind of special cleaning process). I will follow instructions to a T and will update to highly recommend if the product can sustain the washing process on the long run.",
