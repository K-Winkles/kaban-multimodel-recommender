The color is PERFECT! as you can see from the picture. I washed everything before putting it on the Daybed. The comforter is not too heavy but feels good on the skin. The sheets are semi silky and soft. The real test is coming once my pup Patches gets under the covers. We will see how well the sheets hold up to pet hair and wildness. Overall, I give this set a 10 because it does what I need it to do and it looks good plus it's a great price. Shipping was quick. It was packed very neatly and sealed in a bag. I see this set being a keeper. Might even buy another color. It washed and drained pretty well. Dried quickly in the dryer and wasn't wrinkled afterwards. I can see this set being a keeper because of the durability of the comforter. A+++.",

I got the dark Grey & love the pattern on comforter. It's an elegant yet simple design. Not too lavish, not too plain. Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, is because the comforter design stitching, it snags easily, on fingernails and/or pet nails. So I've had to snip off a few snagged threads.

There are days when the temperature goes down to 6 Celsius at Night. Daytime it's nice and warm when sunny. I checked many sellers here on Amazon, countless duvets and comforters. We needed a duvet without a cover, because with the cover it gets too hot. And this duvet exactly does what we were looking for. It is light, soft and Warm. Just perfect! I wasn't very fond of polyester, but it works.We ordered two duvets, one for each. Each was in a separate Amazon box. Each duvet came wrapped in clear plastic. So, Packaging is 10 stars! And so far it's been one month, and we are very happy! Highly recommend!!!",

                "reviewText": "NOTE: Photo shown is straight out of the bag, before washing and sheets you see are a set I already had, not the ones that came with this, although the color is nearly identical to the ones that came with this. Wrinkles decrease over time as I discuss later in this review.What a bargain for such a beautiful set. I purchased king size which came with 4 pillow cases, flat and fitted sheet, and gorgeous, comfy, fluffy comforter. I live in Hawaii but was raised in Michigan so I'm used to sleeping with a big fluffy blanket. Thankfully I have central air which I keep at 70 degrees at all times. This blanket is fluffy yet light weight enough to give me the comfort of using the type of blanket I'm used to without being heavy meaning I don't get too hot. I used to find myself getting cold in the middle of the night from the air being on but this offers the perfect balance for me. If I bundle up in it it keeps me nice and warm, but I can also leave my arms out and cover only chest down and it's still light enough to be extremely comfortable. Material is soft and comfy as well. It came vacuum sealed and did have a few wrinkles. I laid it over my bed for a few hours before washing just to see if the wrinkles would release on their own and after about 4 hours I noticed a significant decrease in wrinkles. I ended up washing in a cold water gentle cycle and tumble dried on low and it came out wrinkle free and beautiful. However, I will say that they do wrinkle back up over time if you're sleeping wrapped up in them in case that is of concern to potential buyers. If you're looking for the perfect year round comforter, I would HIGHLY recommend this set as it offers the best of both worlds.",
