I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d need deep pockets on the fitted sheet or if standard would be adequate. Plus I wanted something relatively plain without being boring, and it had to be soft.This set checked all the boxes. While I don\u2019t need the deeper pockets, this has enough depth to accommodate if necessary. It\u2019s surprisingly soft & well-made, considering how inexpensive it was. The quilt is large enough to provide good coverage on both sides, as does the sheet.While I haven\u2019t washed the quilt yet, I have washed the sheets & shams. Straight from the washer into the dryer - and they came out soft, wrinkle-free, and perfect. I would definitely recommend this bedding set, and wouldn\u2019t hesitate to purchase again.",
