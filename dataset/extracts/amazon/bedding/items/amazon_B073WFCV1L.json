I used both sizes and have a queen mattress and box spring and it's holding well. The reason it's 4 stars is bc they kept sliding while trying to move the bed, so I think adding some sort if sticky thing would help. For context, my box spring isn't a full wood bad; it only has support right in the middle and the outside edges so we had to be very careful with placement.",

Though he doesn't really lean on his table as he paints, there is no wobbling of unsteadiness. whatsoever. He loves the height it give him to paint his artwork and his backaches have subsided considerably.",

                "reviewText": "I first bought this set in September 2020 (for $14) and only used one in 2022 to elevate a computer monitor, which worked well! So long as the monitor was not moved too forcefully it remained steady, the screen at eye level, and it was easy to move around by simply pushing/pulling the furniture riser--no lifting required! I eventually switched it out for a dedicated computer stand (that is adjustable with shelves) and the riser is now back with the rest, but it served as a nice stopgap. I cannot comment on its performance in regards to heavier items, but presumably they will do fine.
