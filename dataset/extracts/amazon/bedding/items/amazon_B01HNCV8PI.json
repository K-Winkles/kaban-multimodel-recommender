This set is far superior to the higher priced ones. They are a better quality, softer, no wrinkles after washing. Because I liked them so much and they are priced so reasonably, I decided to try them on my own bed. I love them. In fact, I just ordered additional sets for the rest of the beds in our home. These are the nicest sheet sets that I have found in years.",

I love the rose flower print on them. I really needed a pair of sheets that didn't ride up or come off at the corners. So far I've only had them a short time but the sheets stay in place and don't ride up at the corners and that was very important to me. The last hundred percent cotton sheets I had on my bed they slid all around on top and the corners kept coming up and off. It was very frustrating. I haven't washed the sheets yet so I'm hoping that goes well but so far I really love them. They fit my deep pockets well at 14 inches and I love that the pillow cases are nice and roomy and long. They completely cover my pillow which my last set of cotton sheets did not do. I'm happy so far.",

That being said, they are much better in the colder or chillier seasons. I won\u2019t be using them in the summer because I just don\u2019t feel like they breathe much- they aren\u2019t thick though! So don\u2019t worry about that. So I wouldn\u2019t say they are cooling for sleep but definitely cozy, comfy, soft, the right amount of thickness. I also wash my bedding weekly and I have not noticed them degrading in any way and have been using them consistently since purchasing. I\u2019d definitely purchase again, for another beautiful print.",
