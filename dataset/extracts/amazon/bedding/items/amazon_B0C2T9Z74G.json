                "reviewText": "I have owned a lot of comforters, duvets, blankets in my life, and WOW- this is one amazing comforter. It came vacuumed sealed (appreciate) - and when it arrived it looked kind of flat -scrunched and wasn't sure what was about to unfold. Well, folks this is one incredible set. Included two pillow shams. This mint green is one of my favorite colors- so it was a no brainer when this caught my eye. When I unfolded the comforter- it fell perfectly onto my bed. LIned up evenly and all the what I thought were wrinkles disappeared. So my eyes were definitely pleased with what I saw. The SOFTNESS is UNREAL. It is one of those products, you fall in love with and go buy a back up, because it is everything you love. That GOOD!The fabric is super buttery soft. Yet, lightweight enough to use even in this 100 degree summer weather. Yet, it is warm enough that during the night should the temp drop, you sleep like a dream. Quite honestly, I have been having the best nights sleep, which I attribute to this comforter. The \"farmhouse shabby chic\" is a lovely style. The cream stitching throughout the comforter is impeccable. No loose strings/threads, very solid constructed blanket. This exceeds my expectations on so many levels. What else is great is that they offer (currently) 11 different color options. Sizes range from TWIN to KING.Dimensions for the KING: 104\" x 90\"Filling: microfiber fabric - very breathable and extremely comfortable.Machine washable - cold water - tumble dry, so easy upkeep.Based on all these factors and my IMMENSE pleasure in this set, I would highly recommend this to other consumers. It is an absolute joy to own this! Well done!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this white comforter set on sale on Amazon and choose the \"curved\" pattern for an extra 10% off putting it at around $24 total. I was concerned if for the price I would recieve not a \"shabby-chic\" but rather shabby product. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and design and once laundered very pleased. It washed beautifully, no loose threads,bunching or wrinkles. It plumped up nicely and fits queen bed perfectly. I have a dusty purple bedroom that I wanted to brighten up with a light color. The white is a very clean soft white,whiter than in picture but not a bright white which very much compliments the shabby-chic style. It is a lightweight but not \"thin\" like some budget comforters. It is comfy & warm. Living in SW Florida I was hoping for a little cooler one. Nice for winter but for summer I remove it at night and sleep with a cooling blanket. Also important to me is linens that are oeko-tex certified. Many are not or what I find most disappointing is that MANY advertised products state oeko-tex but no such label on product or package exists when product arrives. This has a legit oeko-tex certified label on product and I verified the number. In summary,a very good, quality product at a good price.",

So I tried this, the stitching pattern is excellent. The color is perfect. Just perfect! It\u2019s more of a soft seafoam blue/green and I just LOVE it! It\u2019s excellent tempature wise. Very soft. Yes it\u2019s microfiber. So not my usual like. But it is actually a really nice one. Hands down my favorite comforter set I\u2019ve gotten!",
