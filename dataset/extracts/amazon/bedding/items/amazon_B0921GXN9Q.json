It doesn't tend to absorb odor as well as the others so I tend to change the breeding more often. It really helps in identifying places to clean did to its white color. Optimally the best way to use this product is clean the dirty bedding each day and replace it with new bedding instead of cleaning the entire cage at once. This will give you the best bang for your buck, as well, it will keep your bunnies cage odor free and clean!",

It doesn\u2019t help with odor so I find I am changing it out frequently, but that\u2019s ok because there is so much in the bag and it\u2019s lasting a very long time. I\u2019m not sure it dust free because I can see the white specks on my black hamster, but I don\u2019t know how paper like this actually could be completely dust free.

                "reviewText": "As someone who's just started raising a hamster again after half a decade of my last one (RIP Yogi, you old fart), I was nervous about buying this bedding as reviews lately have been hit or miss, but hamster owners with experience still recommended this bedding highly so I took the gamble to try to buy it on a good day and got two 50 liter bags (Technically 49.2 but ya know, semantics), since this time I want to give my hamster the best I can get.It came out great, the packaging was secure, the bedding was soft and fluffy after fluffing it up out of the bag, and thankfully no big dust issues have arisen, which is extra great because I am very allergic to dust. I've only sneezed once while setting my new hamster's (I got him almost a week ago as of writing this) cage up but I expected that given the type of bedding this is and it was only when I was trying to unpack it from the bag.My dwarf hamster has been burrowing under it (a good 6 inches of it) constantly and even has a frequent one he goes to in his cage's corner because it holds them better than Carefresh since that brand is denser than this one. Not only that, it doesn't smell, I've not had any odor come out of my new hamster's cage. Maybe it's too soon to tell, but I think it's still a good sign, I doubt it'll be hard to spot clean since hamsters don't make big messes.The only \"problem\" I have with it is because it is a really expanding fluffy bedding, it is deceiving when you try to fill a 6 inch pan to the near top with it, since the hamster walking around it will flatten it over time due to its lack of density. I recommend adding a different substrate to it to help lessen that, Aspen is great. That's not much of an issue but rather just a fault of what the product is made out of material-wise but it's not too big a deal to be a detriment.Despite the gamble that is seen in the reviews, this bedding is still recommended for hamsters and for good reason. It's soft, fluffy, safe for them to burrow in since it's just paper, great for burrows at that, and although the dustiness has been stated to have risen over the products lifespan, it's also been stated to be not as dusty as Carefresh would be which is why I chose this brand over that one. Lesser of the two evils in that regard, but I say get this for your hamsters nonetheless because the pros outweigh the cons when you get a good bag.",

I can\u2019t imagine all that dust is very good for my hamsters lungs.",

Before I was using a pellet litter for several years until my rabbit developed sore hocks, so I switched to this product and haven't looked back. It isn't stinky or clumpy at all. First I line his litterbox with 2 paper towels, then I add a layer of this and pack it down. I empty the soiled litter daily, it is very easy to dump it into the trash, wipe the box clean, and start again!",

                "reviewText": "My syrian hamster absolutely loves this bedding, as well as how easy it is to maintain his burrows. I have experimented with 2 other types of bedding \u2014 Aspen Shavings and another paper-based bedding\u2014 however Kaytee\u2019s Clean and Cozy beats both in softness, absorbency, and how easy it is to spot clean. Burrowing is so so important for hamsters (please provide AT LEAST 6 inches of bedding for burrowing), and my hammy absolutely enjoys it to the point where he\u2019s made a very elaborate network of burrows for his food, sleeping, toilet, etc. this bedding is very nice in that it also comes through with its claim of being 99% dust free. The previous paper-based bedding I was using claimed this as well, but my hamster started sneezing quite a bit and it was worrying for me as I was afraid he was going to develop an upper-respiratory infection. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this bedding if you want your hamster to have enrichment and thrive in his/her enclosure.Ps. PLEASE make sure you buy this clean and cozy bedding and NOT the scented ones Kaytee sells as well. Scented bedding can lead to an upper-respiratory infection in hamsters.",

My little furry friends absolutely love this bedding! It's soft and comfortable, making their cage a cozy haven.One of the best parts about this bedding is its price. I was pleasantly surprised to find it priced at half of what my local pet shop charges for similar products. This affordability, coupled with the excellent quality, makes it an unbeatable value.Furthermore, the 85-litre pack offers great longevity. It lasts me about two months for my two hamsters, which is impressive considering their activity and nesting habits. This bedding's absorbency is top-notch, keeping the cage clean and odor-free for longer periods.Overall, Kaytee Clean & Cozy Paper Bedding is a 5-star product in my book. It's economical, durable, and most importantly, loved by my hamsters. I highly recommend it to anyone with small pets like hamsters, gerbils, mice, rabbits, or guinea pigs.",
