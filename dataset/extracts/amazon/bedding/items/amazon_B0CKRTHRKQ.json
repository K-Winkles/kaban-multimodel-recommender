                "reviewText": "I searched and searched for a toddler bed set that wasn\u2019t too cartoonish but also wasn\u2019t too boring/adult ish for a little one. I kept coming back to this and thought, let\u2019s give it a try. My only concern before receiving it was, what would the material/fabric of the comforter feel like.The sheets are exactly what you would expect and feel basically as soft as most of the general baby/toddler bedding out there. The comforter was a lot more comfy than I thought it would be! It\u2019s not super thick but it\u2019s most definitely not thin, it\u2019s pretty perfect for a toddler to be honest! It\u2019s pretty plush which is nice and looks adorable in our little girls room.OH I should add, the little rainbow pillow, despite matching perfectly, was not purchased through this company/seller. I found it at Hobby Lobby for $20 and it just so happened to fit exactly right! :)I did wash the sheets, pillow case and comforter the day it arrived and everything was totally fine! I ran the washer on the delicate cycle just to be on the safe side and dried everything on low heat. Came out perfect! I definitely recommend this bedding set!",

                "reviewText": "This bed set is really cute. The print looks just like the picture and is great for a little girl\u2019s room. It fits my toddler\u2019s bed well. I agree with other reviews that this is lightweight. It\u2019s winter here in Colorado so she definitely needs some warm pjs and a blanket in addition to this. I was a little disappointed it\u2019s not more soft. Also, the instructions say machine wash but hang dry. That doesn\u2019t seem the best for life with little kids. I did put it in the dryer and it seems to be holding up fine\u2026 but I\u2019m not sure if it will last as long as I hoped. Overall I\u2019m not unhappy with it, I just don\u2019t like it as much as I thought I would. For the price, I was expecting something a little better.",

She prefers to sleep on our bed so I wondered if maybe she just wanted the blanket/bedding. With this, her dog mattress is protected, it's super easy to clean and I can wash it with her towels and not have to worry about anything getting caught on the zippers.Glad I got this, also because it looks so much better than the typical pet stuff.",
