                "reviewText": "Normally hate purchasing department store type pillows as they often have funky smells. Not these! Fresh new pillows and right size for a special visitor. These match up to youth size pillows on other expensive websites.Opened, washed, dried and fluffed. Great shape retention and loft. Worked so well we confiscated them for our bed after guests left. In use now for over four months and still have the nice shape and loft they had after the first wash.",
