                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars This is a Boho Bargain!",
                "reviewText": "I purchased the comforter in an attempt to turn my bedroom that looks more like a mid level insurance company office into the Boho boudior of my dreams. Did it work? Not exactly...but that is the fault of the interior decorator (me). I need to add a nice rug, more textured pillows, and the like. The comforter itself hits the boho targets: soft and has a subtle textured design. Keep in mind this is a comforter not a duvet cover. It is not as fluffy and puffy as a duvet would be but if you don't want to struggle with stuffing the comforter into the duvet cover and tying the corners only to wake up sweltering under a tangled lump then this is the comforter for you! It is light weight and a true white. I followed the advice of another reviewer and sized up...I was glad I did. The king fits my queen bed nicely. I have a platform bed so it hangs a bit low on the sides but does not touch the floor. Another reviewer did say the comforter is slippery, which I thought was a bit odd. Come to find out...it is true! You will be fine as long as you don't take a running start. I plopped and flopped on the bed and nailed my landing each time. I can perhaps see that it may be a problem - if during a romantic moment, wearing silky negligee there may be some awkward slipping but you can always subtly toss the comforter back or plant one leg firmly on the ground. Do not let that stop you from buying this reasonably priced boho bargain!",

Online I thought I\u2019d pick the other, but in person this green is really pretty so that\u2019s the primary reason I chose it. It also was slightly larger and fell further on the sides of my bed. Very soft and lightweight, but yet has been warm enough so far. The only downside is some weird stitching that causes it to bunch up oddly in some places.",

Finally I have a great fitting comforter. It's light weight enough for the Summer and Heavy enough for the winter (with a blanket of course)!",
