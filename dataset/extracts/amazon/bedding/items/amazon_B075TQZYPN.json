I was very concerned about the stains that many wrote about, but the positive reviews won me over. Plus I could not find the color I wanted anywhere else. When it arrived, I opened with apprehension. Well, imagine how happy I was when there were no stains, not only that, but it is well made. It has neat stitching and comes with three full size pillow shams. It is not made of heavy material nor is it filled, so it is on the lighter side. I wasn't trying to buy a comforter, so it is perfect. The sea-foam is beautiful. This set is simple and elegant; just what I needed for my office/guest room.",

The stitched quilting gives the bedspread and shams added dimension. The fabric has a soft shimmer to it, that adds to its overall quality.The solid color gives you an opportunity to use a variety of accent colors with additional accent pillows. The 3 pillow shams fit well across the back of the daybed/trundle bed. The ties secure the pillow in the sham well and look great. My only recommendation is that the set offer optional king size pillow shams for king size pillows. I would prefer to use 2 king that I already had for the daybed, across the back of the daybed. I was able to put the bedspread over a comforter that I have on the daybed and am very pleased with how well it fits. Actually, with the comforter underneath, the bedding has a more luxurious look. This set is a great value! I highly recommend it!",

                "reviewText": "So, I paid $46.00 for this set and can't even use the bedskirt, and am not happy with the pillow shams. I'll address the pillow shams first. The Amazon photos show there are 3 ties on these shams. When I first looked at this on Amazon, I saw all the photos showed 3 ties. When I saw the 3rd pic over I thought it looked like there were only 2, but then decided it was the way they were positioned. I thought the middle tie loops were just falling behind the pillows. The shams in all the other photos show 3. They gape open as you can see in this pic...and I will add that the pillow I have inside is not very thick. If you have a very fluffy pillow, it will look worse.Now for the bedskirt: I washed this whole set before putting it on my daybed. When they were done drying, I left the shams & main bed cover going in the dryer so they wouldn't sit there & wrinkle & pulled out the bedskirt in order to immediately get it on the daybed. But, when I pulled it out the wrinkles that were there before I put it in the wash were still there. I sprayed them with water & hung them up to dry. Still deep wrinkles. I have no idea what they did to cause this but I find it strange. It looks terrible & I won't use it. Did this happen to anyone else?I'll use the shams, but I'm not happy with them. Even if I wanted to add a tie, trying to find the exact color will be hard. Plus, I shouldn't have to go through all that. So, yeah, not a good value. I basically paid $46.00 for a daybed cover & 3 shams I'm not pleased with. The cover itself is fine. It's soft and seems like it will work out. But, it's not worth $46.00!!",
