                "reviewText": "When the order arrived I was a little shocked at how small the box was. It was literally the size of shoebox for a pair of boots. Then I opened the first box \ud83d\udce6 only to find an even smaller box. Panic set in. I opened the smaller box to find the comforter and shams vacuumed sealed in plastic. There was a little friendly note from the manufacturer assuring the buyer that as the comforter and shams are used, they will evenly fluff up. They apparently fixed an issue with the filling migrating to one area. It's now pocketed with more filling. I pulled out the comforter and shams and lay them out. The the thickness was that of a plush, luxurious towel. I thought to myself, well, it was an incredible bargain. I guess you get what you pay for. I immediately changed my bedding and there it lay, looking like a quilt. I did some cleaning around my house. I return to my bedroom a few hours later to find that it had become fuller. I pulled the comforter back and remade the bed. As it slowly lowered onto the mattress it was completely puffy. Same happened with the shams. It's been a few weeks now, and it's so fluffy. I washed it in my machine on delicate. I choose to air dry my comforters. It washed so well. As it dried the now familiar fluff returned. Yay me! The size is incredibly generous. My husband is always cold \ud83e\udd76 I'm always hot \ud83e\udd75. This is the first time we both are able to enjoy bedding that doesn't freeze him to death or throw me into a hot flash and night sweats. I can't express how totally happy I am with this beautiful comforter set. I'm so impressed with the bargain, beauty, size, maintenance ease, light weight, and of course the fluff. I think I'm going to buy the mustard set. I'm way beyond satisfied!!!",

                "reviewText": "Upon arriving I was shocked (and apprehensive) at how small the box was. It was vacuum sealed very tightly. Upon opening I was worried, it was flat and seemed slightly too small for my king bed, but as the directions said I spread it out, fluffed it up, and waited. I was impatient so I threw it in the dryer on low heat, that helped fluff it a bit but it was still quite flat and wrinkled and I was disappointed. that being said after sleeping with it for a day or 2 it fluffed to full capacity and it is absolutely amazing! so soft, light and fluffy, and the color and stitching design is beautiful. I am so happy with this purchase!",

                "reviewText": "I have a king size bed, ordered the comforter for king/california king. when turned horizontally as advertised, it doesn\u2019t cover both sides. When turned vertical it works but I would like a little more blanket. If it wasn\u2019t on sale when I purchased it it wouldn\u2019t be worth it. Not super thick which I would have enjoyed for the weight but still a very comfortable comforter. Color is exactly as pictured and although previously stated that it isn\u2019t very thick it is still warm. It is wrinkly but just as advertised and not in the bad wrinkly way.",

Most stores were just selling white, gray, and pink. Comes in a very small box. Doesn't look like much when you pull it out. But put it in the dryer for about 5 minutes and it fluffs right up. Love the look of it!",
