            "\u3010Boho Tufted Design\u3011Our pom tufted comforter features jacquard-woven striped patterns, adding an elegant and delicate touch to any bedroom decor. The fluffy pom detailing adds a cozy texture to the fabric, making it even more adorable and comfortable to snuggle up in. The solid comforter elevates the aesthetic appeal of your bedroom while also making it the perfect gift for friends and family.",
            "\u3010Soft & Lightweight\u3011Litanika Beige boho comforter is made from premium-quality, super-soft microfiber that gives you a lightweight and plush feel. It can also provide sufficient warmth for a comfortable sleep. It strikes a perfect balance between being cozy and lightweight. The comforter can offer optimum comfort and breathability all year round. Once covered with it, you'll feel like you're resting on a soft cloud, enabling you to enjoy a peaceful and rejuvenating sleep.",
            "\u30103 Pieces Comforter Set\u3011Our comforter king size includes 1 pom comforter 104x90 inch and 2 pillowcases 20x36 inch. We use vacuum packaging to prevent the comforter set from getting stained during transit. Therefore, we highly recommend leaving the comforter in the sun to give it enough sunlight and gently fluffing it after receiving.",
            "\u3010Thoughtful detail\u3011Litanika uses hidden stitches to maintain the beauty of the comforter while keeping the fillings in place. 4 corner rings allow the comforter to be inserted as a duvet. You can change the duvet cover at any time according to your ideas, creating a customizable bedroom style.",
            "\u3010Easy Care\u3011The Beige bedding comforter set is machine washable, which can save you more time and energy. For year-round softness and to prevent pilling up, it's highly recommended to wash the comforter separately with a laundry bag in a soft mode. Avoid washing with other sharp or rough objects. Machine wash in cold water and dry at low temperature."
