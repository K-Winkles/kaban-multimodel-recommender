                "reviewText": "Fluffy, cuddly, really pretty, and was the perfect thing to bring my daughter\u2019s room together! She absolutely loves it. Daughter said it is the perfect thickness, as it is not too heavy but it keeps you warm and is fluffy and cozy. She loves the color - looks just like it does in picture. Her room has a boho vibe and this comforter fits that well. The pattern is soft and subtle, and brings interesting detail that is not over powering.The only negative thing I would say is that it does not feel like it is top quality. There were a couple of loose strings we trimmed when it arrived, but that was easily fixed. The material it is made with feels thin, and it seems a little delicate. I am hoping it washes well and the materials hold up well enough for it to last a few years. I rated it a 4 because it does not feel like it will last for several years of washes; however, it is still well worth the price in my opinion. It is really beautiful, affordable, and my daughter likes to change her room up every couple of years anyway.If you need it to really last - maybe find an option that is made with more quality materials; however, the price will then go up too. I love this purchase and my daughter says it is perfect!",

I have a queen size bed, but I purchased a King size so that I could have an over sized comforter that hangs over and covers the bed like a spread. This comforter is warm but not too hot. The material is very soft and the boho features are absolutely beautiful. I will be purchasing similar curtains to compliment the comforter. I think this was a good purchase.",
