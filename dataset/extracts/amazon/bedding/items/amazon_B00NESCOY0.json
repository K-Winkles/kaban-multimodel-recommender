This mattress pad fits my bed great! I don't have to worry about the corners slipping off during the night and it fits very well. No overhang on the sides. It washed and dried perfect, no wrinkles or shrinking. Utopia is my go to brand when getting anything, bedding. I have Utopia Qsz fleece blankets in all my bedrooms, since it's turned cold I bought the Sherpa and fleece lined blankets for the 3 beds in my home- they are extremely warm and comfy. I buy Utopia pillows and throw pillows as well as mattress encasements. Great quality, highly recommend. Great products at reasonable prices.",

The pad takes a while to fluff out after you remove it from the vacuum bag in which it's packed, so be patient -- it will fill out very nicely and provide a lot of comfort (which is good for iffy sleepers like me). And I was surprised to find that the pad also seems to have fixed a problem I'd had with a sheet wrinkling up with my previous pad, that I'd thought was the sheet's problem. Not so, the sheet now fits perfectly and doesn't seem to wrinkle up any more. A really good buy!",
