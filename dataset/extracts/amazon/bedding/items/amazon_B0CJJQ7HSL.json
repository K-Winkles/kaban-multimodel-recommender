I have a 10 inch memory foam mattress and it\u2019s a bit roomy, but not overly. Tucks in just fine. Would definitely fit a deep pocket mattress. I\u2019m very happy.",

I like that the package contains everything you need for a bedding refresh. The shades of green are not identical from the comforter to the sheets to the pillowcases but that\u2019s okay. My teen likes the pockets on the sides of the sheets so that she can stick her remote or phone in there when she goes to sleep.",
