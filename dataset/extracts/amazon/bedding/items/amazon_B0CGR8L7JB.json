I had been looking for something that would fit his bed, and add a little bit more space to his room since he loves all things outer space. This comforter is lightweight, but it provides a nice amount of warmth on these chilly nights. The comforter washes well, and I haven't noticed any loose threads. Overall, this adds a nice little addition to my son's bedding.",

I love the mix of colors, which are bright and really very pretty. The mermaids are cute and I love the sweet expressions on their faces. The comforter is just a little bit on the thin side but not \"cheap feeling\" by any means. In fact, it's definitely well made. The twin size comes with a pillowcase. Highly recommend!",
