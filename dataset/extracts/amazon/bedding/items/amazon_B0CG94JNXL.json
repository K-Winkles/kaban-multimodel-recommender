                "reviewText": "This is my first small step to getting my bedroom into a space I enjoy and it was the right step to make.I love the design and the little tufts are short enough that they aren't distracting feeling. The color is great, I've got a wood bed frame coming that will go perfectly with this.It does have four tie straps in each of the corners for the insert so keep that in mind if purchasing a new insert. I ordered the Amazon basics one and it has loops for attachments in the middle of each side...so the loops don't match the straps inside this duvet. I was able to just tie around the tips of the corner fabric of the insert instead and will probably add little loops to the insert or straps to the duvet myself just to make it easier in the future.",

                "reviewText": "This duvet cover set is a lovely, restful, muted green, goes well with my soft cottage bedroom decor. I was concerned that the decorative stitching would be uncomfortable, but it is so soft and adds a nice textural element to the look of the bedding. The queen size is generous and will fit a very fluffy/oversized duvet/comforter inside, the zipper is very smooth and closes securely, and the fabric washes and dries with no problems at all.",
