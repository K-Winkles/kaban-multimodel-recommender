                "reviewText": "I never much cared for the way my room looked before but for some reason I decided that it needed to look presentable after purchase of a new bedroom set. The new set was walnut so I wanted something in that color range. Being new to decorating my room, it took some time to make a decision on a comforter set. Again, not knowing much about home decorating really(brands,sizes,etc.), I decided on this Madison Park. In fact I had 3 others from the same brand in my wish list for comparison. This fit the bill perfectly. First of all, it came packaged well with a nice thick heavy plastic bag that can be used for later storage. Second, was the comforter itself. It's thick and plush without being too bulky. All seams are nicely sewn along with the buttons on this particular model. They are very secure. With a light blanket it's the perfect weight for my cold natured self. The shams and pillows are well made and very good looking to boot. The whole color scheme is well represented in the photos. The comforter washes well, but being large, it sometimes reverts into ball form in my HE dryer, so it does sometimes require spot ironing for a completely smooth look. All in all, this was a home run of a purchase. Well made, nice color, perfect fit, and great price. I couldn't ask for more for being a first time buyer. Would definitely buy again.",

                "reviewText": "This bedding set is really beautiful and makes a plain bed instantly shift into \"dressed up\" status. The quality of the materials is ok - not stellar, but nothing to complain about - and the workmanship on the stitching is reasonable - no obvious errors (loose/missing stitches, signs of being \"irregular,\" etc.) or skill issues to note. The set comes with several throw pillows as well as a bed skirt, all of which ended up packaged and stored because I'm just not that interested in the extras. In all, a lovely set which does a nice job of dressing up the bedroom.Now the negatives - well, only one, honestly. It's the horizontal pleating at the \"ankle level\" when the bed is made. Unfortunately, after tossing the comforter into the dryer (to fluff it up and help reduce some of the dog hair my pup left behind), a section of the pleated portion \"reversed\" itself somehow and will not (absolutely NOT!) lie flat anymore. A friend suggested taking an iron to it, but meh, I'm pretty sure that's just how I end up with scorch marks on my blanket! Hoping a spritz and a re-fluff in the dryer will remedy the issue. Still, it's a pretty set and had I not messed it up in the dryer I wouldn't have anything negative to say about it.",

Way to go Amazon. Likely this will not get posted because Amazon will want to let people find out the hard way so if not I will find another way to voice my opinion and if it does get posted it just a warning for anyone who has been long time customer",
