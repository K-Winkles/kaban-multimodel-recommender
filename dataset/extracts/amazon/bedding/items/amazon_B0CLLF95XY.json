We did not use the pillow shams as we don\u2019t have extra pillows on that bed, but it\u2019s the same material as the comforter, but without the filling.So if you\u2019re looking for a lightweight, warm and unique comforter, this is an absolutely solid choice.",

The fabric is soft, and the color is really nice (it looks much greener in person than it does in my pictures.The comforter is thick and fluffy, but doesn't make me overheat.The pillow cases are for King Sized pillows, and they fit perfectly.My only complaint is that the tag is on the side of the comforter instead of the bottom. Usually when I put sheets or comforters on the bed, I look for the tag because then I know where the bottom is, but when I did that with this set, the comforter was too short on the two sides. But then when I rotated it so that the tag was on the side, it fit perfectly. Not a huge deal, just odd.Overall, I'd recommend this Comforter set.",

The texture adds so much interest beyond a plain white linen duvet and it really made our primary bedroom into a haven. I can't rave enough about how expensive this looks.",

They didn\u2019t cover all the way down the sides of the mattress. This one perfectly fits the mattress all the way around and goes down on the side to cover the mattress.The waffle weave also looks great. Don\u2019t love king size pillows, but understand that\u2019s the size of pillowcase that comes with all king size blankets.This is a nice weight because it provides a bit more than a coverlet, but not as much as a thick comforter. Good mid weight option!",

The linen color is really beautiful, it keeps the color light, but hides a little more than white would (especially for a messy teen). When we recieved the package, we thought we got the wrong item because it was meant to be a whole comforter and not just a cover, but it just comes nicely packaged in air tight plastic, so once we fully opened it, it expanded to an appropriate size. My daughter said the blanket keeps her the perfect temperature at night, not too hot but warm enough to be cozy. The material is very soft to the touch. GREAT VALUE!",
