Depending on your dry you may have to dry it a few time before its done. I had to air dry mine after a few cycles of drying. However, it's warm and light on the body. It's about a 1inch 1/2 thick and very plushy toy like. The color was great to so far I'm really enjoying this set in the cold weather.",
