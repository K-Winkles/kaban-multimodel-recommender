The weight is neither too heavy nor too light, the color is exactly what I was looking for, and it washes up beautifully. The color stated is plum, which is a good descriptor for this purple blanket. I washed the blanket in cold water, using the gentle cycle, before putting it on the bed. Additionally, I used a gentle laundry soap instead of detergent. I dried on medium. The blanket came out softer and just as bright. I would definitely recommend the product and will buying more in other colors.",

                "reviewText": "Needed to replace a cotton blanket I'd gotten from a hospital stay almost 30 years ago to put on top of my comforter during Colorado winter & I couldn't be more pleased with this Utopia Bedding Queen blanket in dark gray. Ironically the weave pattern is identical to the blanket it's replacing, wanted something a bit more durable than waffle weave with my fur baby & this is perfect. It's a perfect weight not too light & not too heavy, most impressed with the queen size on my 16\u00bd inch pillow top mattress as it hangs down on both sides completely covering the mattress. It's almost as long on the sides as the king size duvet cover it's on top of & the picture was taken after 2 washings. Washed in cold water with low dryer heat & the blanket did wonderfully with zero shrinking & no issues at all with color changing in any areas. I know from experience the blanket will continue to soften over time with each wash. I expect this blanket will last every bit as long as my previous one or longer. The pricing on the Utopia Bedding blankets is outstanding for the quality. The only small thing I noticed is 2 loose threads & a small imperfection on the edge, nothing that concerns me or reduces quality in my opinion. Highly recommend this blanket to all looking for a quality 100% cotton blanket!",

It is simple to wash with not too much fiber loss and the grey color is exactly what I expected.It did not cover what I had measured it for, after washing it may have shrunk so I won't remove a star, but it cannot be used for what I intended.Overall, this throw is very nice looking, feels just right and seems durable.

I have a double bed and I ordered the twin size and it is perfect. I find the queen size is usually too big for my bed. I sleep alone mind you.",

                "reviewText": "Not super warm but it's better to have layers than to have one too-warm blanket. So buy two or three for warmth or maybe a fleece throw on top. I like it since it is well made, tough, has a good weight to it and looks good. It is cotton which was important for me but for some reason it collected a lot of static in the first wash. Might be the factory treatment. But no issues at all. Big enough to tuck in and seems a bit oversized.",
