                "reviewText": "This iDOO Water Heated Mattress Pad, Heated Electric Mattress Pad no Electric Wire no Radiation is much better than the coiled type mattress pads of old that seem to dry out my skin. This mattress pad provides the heated water circulating through the stand alone unit that sits on a night stand or on the floor next to your bed. ( I do wish the water tube that the water flows through we a tad bit longer so that the unit can sit on the floor or night stand a bit more discretely. (Not a deal breaker) I was surprised at the warmth and heat that the mattress pad provided in record time you could feel the heat emitting. The mattress pad was simple to lay out and install on the top of your mattress. The long loop bungy elastic bands easily fit around the mattress corner holding the mattress pad in place. The table top unit allows you to set the temperature, & shut off timer. Using this iDOO Water Heated Mattress Pad, Heated Electric Mattress Pad no Electric Wire no Radiation allows me to set my home thermostat down even lower providing a better cost savings against my home heating cost. The unit container was easy to fill with water sliding off the panel and filling to the water fill line that pumps and circulates the water throughout the heated mattress pad. You don't even hear the unit running once powered on and the heated temperature is set. I feel really toasty underneath my covers with this mattress pad in place it feels good to to have to feel the coils felt through using the electric heated mattress pad. So, after testing out this iDOO Water Heated Mattress Pad, Heated Electric Mattress Pad no Electric Wire no Radiation pad even though the cost is a few dollars more than what I've seen of the electric mattress pads this unit will save you much more money in the long run keeping you warm and toasty. Good value I would recommend this iDOO Water heated mattress pad the quality is solid.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this in hopes that I can cut down from running my heater as much during this winter. My first alternative was a floor heater, it does the job but is heavy on my energy use. Trying this heated pad does help plenty. I like the fact that it\u2019s actual water running through the blanket opposed to wires, etc.My first concern was whether the water would get clogged in the tubes by laying on it. I tested it by bending and bundling the blanket unrealistically and the results were good. It also comes with a small air pump, just in case it clogs.Like some room heaters, it also has a button button that turns it off if the devices surfaced isn\u2019t flat. The second safety feature is an alert/cut off when there\u2019s not enough water in the reservoir. The max temp is 140 degrees, which is very warm but doesn\u2019t feel hot. The material of the pass itself is surprisingly soft enough to sleep on itself. The only mentionable con that I can find with this would be the length of the tube that connects the pad to the machine. Overall it\u2019s a great product.",

It has a child lock feature as well as a timer so you can set it and forget it. It does feel a bit weird to lay on as you can feel the tubes in the bed. So far no leaks and it\u2019s running smoothly. (Knock on wood) Overall, it\u2019s a good buy as you can warm up the ed before you jump in it on those cold nights or days.",

                "reviewText": "There\u2019s nothing like getting under the covers of a warm bed when it is freezing cold outside. This water heated mattress pad ensures that your bed is comfy and warm when you get under the covers. It does a great job keeping things warm but not hot, and you can set the timer to turn off, so it doesn\u2019t keep heating you all night. The idea of it using water is something I haven\u2019t heard of before, but hey if it works! My only concern is if, over time this springs a leak, it could potentially cause issues with the mattress. So, for now I am just keeping an eye on it, and my pets away from it. Thus far it is cool idea, that seems a lot safer than the old wired heating blankets.",
