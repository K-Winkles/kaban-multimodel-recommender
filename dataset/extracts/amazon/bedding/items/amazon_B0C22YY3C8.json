Compared to $300+ at most of the places I looked I decided it was worth a try.What sold me were the grest reviews,100% linen, French grown flax from Normandy (manufactured in China), Certified by OEKO-TEX STANDARD.I wasn\u2019t expecting amazing quality but when I opened the box it was nice packaging, and the linen duvet construction looks solid. No lose threads, or obvious cheapness.Side by side my much more expensive sheets I can say a few things:Morrow: Thick, heavy, scratchy material, not as comfortable out of the box but after 6 (yes 6!) washes they are starting to soften and become comfortable. Quality and I can tell will last.Atlinia: fabric is light and airy, more see through, silky and cool to the touch. Soft and comfortable before washing.For a Duvet I don\u2019t plan to wash as much as sheets I\u2019m perfectly happy with this purchase. It\u2019s beautiful, well made, soft and most importantly completes my linen obsession bed dreams for 1/3 the cost! If it falls apart horribly after washing I\u2019ll update this review but the quality feels there. If anything I can say the fabric is thin so maybe not as long lasting as something thicker. For the price I\u2019m ok with that.If you like researching before a purchase they have a nice Instagram page you can look at.",

                "reviewText": "So first off let me just say this duvet cover feels incredibly luxurious and I think is great value. It\u2019s not easy to find 100% linen bedding at this price point, but after weeks of mulling it over I decided to buy this one. Right out of the box it felt incredibly soft, heavy, and expensive. I know linen gets softer the more you wash it so I can\u2019t wait to see how this investment changes over time. I\u2019ve had it almost 2 months now and it\u2019s been through numerous washes and still feels and looks great, but it does produce a TON of lint in the dryer still. I also have two cats, and while I was worried about claws and hair, the cat hair doesn\u2019t stick to linen like it does cotton, and if one of them is naughty and claws at the fabric, I\u2019m able to move it around and make the small hole close back up! Aside from these pros, I do have two areas of complaint: sizing and the inner ties. I have a queen size duvet insert and this cover is much too big for it so there\u2019s a lot of extra fabric that has to be shuffled around after you put it on. Two of the inner ties were accidentally sewn into the side seam so I have to tie what\u2019s left in a knot, which is either an absolute pain to take out (if I make the knot tight) or comes loose and unties. Regardless, I love the feel of this duvet, so I deal.My recommendations: buy this cover, get an insert that\u2019s a size up from the cover, and check that the ties are all functional before you wash it!",
