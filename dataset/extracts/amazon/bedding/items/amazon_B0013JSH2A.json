                "reviewText": "I was reluctant to order from this seller because of some of the reviews. However, my experience was very good. The full size set arrived quickly. It appears to be well made, and looks, well, just like the picture. For the price it's a good value. Yes, the comforter fabric is a little stiff and not super thick, but it washed well and that seemed to help with the softness some. This set is not \"oversized\" at all, but I would say it it true to size. The mattress I put it on is a little thicker than standard, so it doesn't cover it the way I would like, but it's fine. And, it's for a 6 years old kids room...the most important thing is, he loves it.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered this when a local big box store was sold out of the outer space themed bedding I had so badly wanted for my son's room. I didn't have high hopes for the quality as it is a bed in a bag and my experience has always been the sheets are of lesser quality than those purchased individually. Boy was I wrong! The comforter, shams, and sheets were all very well made, there is a nice weight to the comforter and the sheets don't have that polyester feel to them. They are 50/50 blend and very pretty! I was pleasantly surprised to say the least and the price was right!",

                "reviewText": "It was really hard to find space themed bedding - so glad we found this. It's not the softest comforter in the world but might be softer after a few more washings. It is a great weight though - not too hot and not too cold. It looks great in my son's space themed room. Wish there were matching curtains!Update: about 9 months after purchase, daily use and lots of washings this bedspread has held its color and shape. I'd say it's really well made!",

The colors are vivid and the fabric is a good quality although low thread count. The comforter was a good weight and appears to be of good quality. For an inexpensive set, it exceeded my expectations and made for a beautifully decorated room. Unlike one of the previous comments, the full-sized sheet set was true to size and fit very well. The shipping was fast and packaging was good. Very happy with the quality and shipping service.",
