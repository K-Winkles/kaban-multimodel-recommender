The quality of this is as good as if not better than higher priced ones. It's lightweight, soft, and warm. You will have to wash it before use, but that is not an issue to complain about!",

                "reviewText": "The quality of the product is incredible. Micro fiber just feels super smooth, washes well, and is able to retain it's color very easily.This kit is super versatile too, it came with exactly all we needed, the zipper on the duvet cover and pillow casea is a nice and handy addition.My biggest complaint is how hot it can get. Unlike cotton this doesn't seem to breathe well, so if you are a person who like to sleep on the cooler side this may be hard for you. We even had to buy a thin quilt because our duvet (that was used for many years) was suddenly getting too hot.All around, as long as you understand this DOESNT BREATHE MUCH, go for it :)",
