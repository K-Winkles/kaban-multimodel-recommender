However, I went with it for this one because I\u2019d been searching for a white/cream colored boho blanket that\u2019s soft and the reviews for this one said it has all of those qualities and they were right! The weight is great, the decorative fabric on the front adds the right amount of boho for me, and the material is truly soft. I\u2019ve washed and dried mine 2 or 3 times since I purchased it about a month ago, and the blanket has held up very well. The quality of these blankets is so good, and the seller truly matched the product with the description so I bought another one. It\u2019ll take a little time but I honestly see most of the colors being part of my collection.Thank you for providing such a wonderful product!",

                "reviewText": "The first thing you'll notice is how incredibly soft this is--like you've had it for years and it's been washed so many times that it's become like butter.The next thing you'll notice is that it's well made, quilted, and the decoratively frayed ridges are also straight and even.You'll wonder, \"How can cotton be this soft,\" because it looks and feels like cotton. The answer is, it's 100% polyester, though I'd never have known without looking at the label.This is a beautiful piece that could easily be 4-5 times more expensive at a boutique. It can look boho, and mid-century modern (I have it as a throw on a mid-century modern daybed and it looks original).It's lightweight and cozy--but don't expect it to be particularly warm.I'm so pleased with it I'm buying a second, and matching pillow covers!You'll love it!",

                "reviewText": "I am the blanket QUEEN and have so many- so trust my review. I just received and is the most beautiful and softest blanket I've ever had. It's even better than pictured and the color is exactly what is advertised. The softness is unexplainable- \" its like butter\". I don't need to wash before using. It's a medium thickness and worth every penny. If you are questioning a purchase I highly recommend. You will not be disappointed. I will be grabbing a few more colors to have one in each room. Perfect size and thickness for an extra blanket on the bed or throw on the couch",
