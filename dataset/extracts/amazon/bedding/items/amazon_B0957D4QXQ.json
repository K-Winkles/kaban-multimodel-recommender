It stays cooler than our previous one. My dogs love it and are constantly burrowing their faces in it. My family can be found more frequently on my bed now! The Pompoms are a cute detail that adds something a little extra without being gaudy. Being white, it does show all hair and lint so I have to pick those off daily but I also want it to look clean. It does shift at night so I have to readjust it every morning. When it first came, I washed and dried it according to instructions but it was incredibly wrinkled. I did iron it but realized after that I ironed the bottom side. (Insert eye roll). My dog peed on it right after (another eye roll) so I washed again. It did have fewer wrinkles with the second washing but I did not iron. You can see the wrinkles in the photos. Hope that they will continue to lessen over time. It was a great purchase and I would recommend.",
