I was worried I would have to wait to put this on my mattress as I didn\u2019t have a mattress cover at all anymore on my memory foam mattress. I washed my old mattress cover and it got ate up in the washer!!!The instructions say two people, put the mattress on wall and do top corners.. we\u2019ll I just turned my mattress sideways on the bed and did the corners hanging off and just scooted my way down until I got to the bottom going back and fourth then to get under it I just stood it up with an arm and scorched it down. it took some time but got the job done. This one is better than the old one visually already. I haven\u2019t tested out the water proof claims yet but I\u2019m sure it does a better job than my old one also!!! Anyways made my mattress look new, is washable, feels cool to the touch, so soft, good zipper, nifty velcrowso the zip doesn\u2019t get undone, and so far durable enough my animals won\u2019t hurt it! I\u2019d say bang for the buck and save your mattress while you still can!!!",

I put it on by myself. Very pleased.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this product because I am an adult with severe dustmite allergies.This cover arrived within a week, and I put it straight on my bed. I noticed a lot of reviews mentioned a plasticky smell to this bed cover but I didn't really notice one - if it was there, it was very mild. I managed to get this full mattress encasement onto my bed by myself which pleases me because my husband is not overly helpful when it comes to domestic things like this. I have a queen size, pillow top mattress and this mattress encasement fit like a glove. It goes overtop of the whole mattress and zips easily- there is even a little fabric flap to cover the zipper so you will never catch it. Genius!This has not impacted the comfort level of my mattress. It is no harder nor hotter than before I put this encasement on. It doesn't ripple or make crunchy sounds when I roll around on it. In fact, if it weren't me that put the encasement on the bed, I would never even know it was there!This encasement washes well, and dries well also (be sure to put it on air dry - no heat!) I wake up in the morning with clear sinuses (something that never happens with a bare mattress). This encasement is more water-resistant than water proof (my mattress did get a bit damp when I spilled an entire bottle of water on my bed) but for small messes, it works wonders. If you are looking for a good quality full mattress encasement for dust-mite protection (like myself) I would HIGHLY recommend this product. 5/5 stars. Would buy again.Update: I did buy again. I bought a twin sized cover for my dog's twin bed and I couldn't be happier with it. This mattress cover holds up against a 150 pound puppy - it's worth every penny.",
