It\u2019s comfortable, thick and plush, it keeps me warm but not too hot, and it\u2019s softer than it looks! My cats also love it, and I was told microfiber material is the best protectant against their claws. If the cats like it, it\u2019s soft enough for me.",

Im really disappointed bacause i love this comforter and it said on the tag that cold gentle wash and dry is ok on the tag. I recommend taking it to the dry cleaner instead of washing at home. It's still nice and usable but not the same as it was before the wash/dry. Very fluffy and warm but lightweight. Like sleeping in a cloud. Debating whether to buy another one because me and my husband love it so much. We got it in white in california king size to have some extra slack on our king size bed. It was a little wrinkled at first from being vacuum sealed but looks better after being used for a few days.",
