                "reviewText": "Have full size bed that is higher than normal. Wanted this to go to floor so ordered California King size. Worked well. Will need to shorten width of king size pillow shams, but I sew so can do that. Pleased with the appearance and decorative subtle pattern of solid fabric. Looks good on bed - just as nice as a much more expensive bedding. Now colors are challenging when shopping online! This is more of a seafoam green - definitely NOT sage. It is a soft, muted soft green with grayish tone. I expected a light brighter warmer green with a bit of pop. After deliberating, I decided the color is a keeper. This is a very lightweight cover (south Louisiana resident) so fairly thin. If you're looking for bedding with thickness/weight, this probably won't work for you. Final opinion is that I made a very good purchase which was inexpensive.",

The quality of fabric is really nice and soft, and the stitching is done beautifully. The cover is very thin. It will serve you as a blanket only on warm days. We use it as a cover only, it looks great and serves its purpose. I think it's a bit pricey for such a thin cover, but it's really beautiful!",
