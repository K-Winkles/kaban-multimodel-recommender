                "reviewText": "So I just want to start off by saying this is the second set that I bought. The first set that I bought I had for a year and they were amazing the quality was spot on and they are perfect. But I have a king bed but it's a little bigger and fluffier so I decided to buy the California king size and they fit absolutely perfect. They are very comfortable and very warm. If you are someone who runs on the warmer side than these might not be for you but at the same time they are great. It comes with one comforter for pillow cases a fitted sheet and top sheet.I am very impressed with the quality of these I will probably buy another set next year because I like new. It's not because they wear or degrade. If you want a comforter set that is going to make you happy and be very comfortable and have really good quality these are what you want. And for the price you cannot go wrong these are very well priced for what you are getting. I really can't say much else about them except for their fantastic and I love them. When you wash them they wash nicely the sheets and pillowcases dry pretty quick but the comforter takes a little bit longer to dry but it's worth it. I know I said I wasn't going to say anything else more but this comforter set is amazing and I recommend it 10 out of 10.",
