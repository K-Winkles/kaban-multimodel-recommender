                "reviewText": "I purchased this comforter/sheet set because I was looking for a light blue, lightweight comforter for our captain\u2019s bed since we have to tuck all sides under the mattress. The sheets were just a \u201cfreebie\u201d, as far as I was concerned, that I could really careless about. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how much we like them. I immediately laundered everything before putting them on the bed (cool water, delicate cycle, low dry). I removed the sheets IMMEDIATELY from the dryer and was floored that there were no wrinkles. My high dollar, high cotton count, thicker sheets wrinkle hideously!As you can see by the pictures, these sheets appear ironed, but they\u2019re not (I am an ironing freak, too!). These sheets are so soft, even more so than my other high dollar, high cotton count, thicker sheets. I\u2019m shocked quite frankly, at how soft they are. Our puppy sleeps with us, too and he didn\u2019t budge once, all night long. It\u2019s like he found his own little piece of bed heaven and he has a very plush dog bed. I\u2019ll add that our bed and pillows are queen size and everything fits perfectly.1). Flat sheet picture - no wrinkles2). Fitted sheet picture - no wrinkles3) Completely made bed - side view; please note the comforter isn\u2019t supposed to look \u201cwrinkle\u201d free, this is how it is designed4). Completely made bed - full on viewWhat really surprised me is after sleeping on the sheets, as I was making the bed the next morning, the sheets are still NOT wrinkled! WHAT! Okay, I\u2019m sold! In saying that, you should be aware that the sheets are thin & I mean THIN. I don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll hold up over the long haul, but after one washing they look great. We live in a year-round warm environment, so we like that they are thin, but if you live in a cold environment, you may only use these in the summertime.Would I buy another set of these sheets? Heck yes! However, I will wait a few months because I want to see how they hold up over several washings. The thinness still concerns me a bit, so I do recommend washing them on delicate cycle.",
