I have a frame with more than the usual number of legs, so it was great to be able to buy multiple packs in order to fit my needs. The shape of these risers also works super well for my frame, which has multiple legs that need risers very close together. For that reason, it\u2019s great that these risers are in a very straight shape, compared to the usual shape that widens at the bottom. The foam pads are a nice addition as well, which isn\u2019t typically included with risers, and help make the bed feel just a bit sturdier. Overall I definitely recommend!",

                "reviewText": "These function seemingly fine for working as a furniture riser except the included rubber mats that are intended to be placed around the bottom edge of the cups are incredibly difficult to attach and seemingly effortless to come off if sliding the furniture for cleaning needs. The base material seems to be sturdy enough to hold up some furniture (though I'm uncertain if I would trust it with something as heavy as a bed). The material in question, though, appears to be a magnet for pet hair, almost like a balloon that has a high static charge.",

                "reviewText": "--| Overview |--I purchased this for two reasons.1) I came across an older model roomba, it would wedge itself in the curve of the sofa and get compressed in the carpet, and not have enough torque to get out.2) I'm quite tall and figured a taller sofa might be nicer in general. Previous configuration put my knees above the waistline and this made getting up more effort then it should be if it were just at the right height to begin with.This solution seemed the easiest, but perhaps not the best. I figured the best would be actual replacement legs, but these are harder to come by. I decided to roll the dice and try these and so far they seem to work out well and address both these problems.--| Pros |--- 4 sets of 2 Pieces makes it quite tall.- Makes getting up and down from the sofa easier as a tall person.- the Roomba no longer gets stuck under the sofa.--| Cons |--- 8 pieces, with 4 set of foam and rubber means this will be a set of 4; either stacked, or one piece with 4 pieces that would be useless without a lot of effort.- still a small amount of wobble in the double stack configuration on carpet. - I have found that using the foam, but not the rubber bottom works best. - This allows the support lines to bite into the carpet more and give less play--| Conclusion |--I feel these add more height and addresses the Roomba getting stuck and makes it easier to get up and down from the sofa. They are a viable solution.I feel replacement legs might have been a better solution, but the sofa already had 5 inch legs on it. I would have needed to find 8-10 inch legs which are hard to find, but would probably look better and have zero play in them if made right.This option was cheaper and easier and seems to do the trick, so I plan to keep using these.",

Diese banalen, kleinen Kl\u00f6tzchen waren f\u00fcr sie buchst\u00e4blich ein Quantensprung an Lebensqualit\u00e4t.Theoretisch kann man zwei Kl\u00f6tze \u00fcbereinander stapeln (Die Packung enth\u00e4lt acht identische Kl\u00f6tze). Davon rate ich ab: Das Ergebnis ist nicht stabil. Das mag mit anderen M\u00f6beln funktionieren, die sich nicht bewegen. Bei der Benutzung eines Sessels ergeben sich aber immer leichte Bewegungen nach vorne oder hinten. Also haben wir die Kl\u00f6tze auf zwei Sessel aufgeteilt.Die Teile sehen recht billig aus, deshalb ein Punkt weniger bei den B-Noten. Allerdings waren die Kl\u00f6tze auch recht billig.\u00dcber die Haltbarkeit kann man noch nichts sagen.Meine Mutter ist jedenfalls begeistert.",

But the extra 3\u201d has made things so much easier. The sofa legs just fit into the cups, but you need to measure carefully to ensure they will fit. Because of the weight of the sofa it was quite difficult to fit them but it was well worth the effort. Only criticism is having to buy a pack of 8 when we only needed 4, but they are great value for money and do the job perfectly.",
