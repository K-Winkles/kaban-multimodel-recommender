Soft and light - we were intentionally looking for a light-weight duvet (it is not thin, just light-weight). It is a good price for a \"bed in a bag\" that is also cute.The in-between:It is larger than I expected - neither good, nor bad - but the fitted sheet fits big - I wish it was a bit more fitted to the mattress.The bad:I ordered this set once and then ordered a replacement, thinking the one I got initially was defective - There was no GLOW. However, the second set was also not at all glow in the dark, not the pillow case , not the duvet, absolutely no fragment on this set is glow in the dark .After 2 washes the seems are getting unraveled, I just missed the return window , I am not even sure it is worth the hassle of returning...",
