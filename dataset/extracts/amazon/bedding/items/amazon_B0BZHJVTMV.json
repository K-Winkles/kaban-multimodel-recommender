They quickly responded and resolved my issue and they made the process extremely easy. I was incredibly stressed about shipping back such a large box but they were very generous and got me through the process with zero stress. The bed was very beautiful when it came out of the box. The velvet is extremely soft and everything was very sturdy. The process of putting it together was fairly simple and I am excited to get the correct size and finally get to enjoy my new bed! You cannot beat the quality for the price. It is definitely the same quality as some beds you would pay $1000 for at a local furniture retailer.",
