This set is absolutely beautiful and is princess themed. When I got it put on my daughters she was so excited and wanted to get in the bed right away. The bedding seems to be well made, soft, and I'm guessing comfortable for her cause she sleeps just fine with the bedding on her bed. It also looks great on her pink Minnie mouse bed! I would definitely recommend this bedding set for little girls! It is so adorable!!",

The package comes in a vacuum sealed package which ends up being great for shipping.The comforter is a typical synthetic comforter but the perfect size for a toddler bed.Overall, this product is great for medium temperatures and higher (60+ degrees) and you'd probably want to supplement the comforter with something warmer on colder nights.Pro:Machine washablePerfect fit in our two toddler mattressesGreat printCon:Comforter is a little on the light side but usableI did set it up prior to washing to take pictures. After washing, the set looks the same but without the creases.",

                "reviewText": "My son has outgrown his baby blanket and needed a new bed set for his converted crib bed. He's into vehicles right now so this set is perfect. The blanket is big enough that it will cover the entire standard crib mattress and the pillow will fit a regular adult pillow which he isn't using yet but we may upgrade that next. The material is softer than I expected, it has a big of that soft sleeping bag or puffy jacket feel to it. I think that it will be good for our area (SF bay area). The colors are very nice and bright and the print is very clean as well. I'm very happy with this bed set and would recommend it to others.",

The material is too rough for my baby's skin. Also the thread used on the stitching is very badly executed. I would not recommend this product for a toddler, adult maybe, but not toddler.

The color is beautiful very similar to pictures listed on the product page. This set washes well and there is no shrinkage or color bleeding. My only complaint is that my toddler's mattress is 6 inch thick and there is not enough fabric in the fitted sheet to go under his crib. It lays just at the edge.- Overall this is a nice quality set and my toddler loves this.",
