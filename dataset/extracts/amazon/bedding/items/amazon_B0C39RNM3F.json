Two nights in a row I\u2019ve woken up drenched in sweat. I\u2019m writing this at 4am after sleeping so horrible I got up and changed the bed!The package said Q/K green though I ordered a King. So it\u2019s very short and smaller than my regular King comforter. It\u2019s also extremely thin. Doesn\u2019t look like the photo it\u2019s more like a thin sheet. But that would have been okay if it wasn\u2019t so damn hot!I bought this because I wanted natural fabrics, and I\u2019m pretty sure I spent two nights baking in synthetic fibers. The tag specify a \u201couter fabric 100% cotton\u201d with no info on the stuffing contents.The pillow case are body pillow length and too long for my regular pillows but one did fit my body pillow. The cases are nice are and breathable unlike the blanket.DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU LIKE SLEEPING IN PLASTIC WRAP! I\u2019d give 0 stars if or let me.",
