Not really thick, just the way we like it cause we get hot during the night and we live up north Alabama. If so we can always add a blanket underneath it . I do have a queen size bed , but after reading reviews I ordered a king. Love how it fits. But with the pillow covers make sure you get flat pillows king size. Mine are a little fluff, hard to put on. I would order this again or from this company. Very happen with this set!",

The shams are sewn together nicely and easily fit a queen size pillow. This is the 2nd set I've ordered.",
