Great price/value! We\u2019re using as a guest room set so it doesn\u2019t see a ton of action. I\u2019ve paired with flannel sheets for the winter. The feel is soft like a blend and it doesn\u2019t wrinkle terribly like cotton tends to do. I\u2019ll update the post if the seams pull or anything pills because that\u2019s the biggest thing I notice with cheaper textiles.",
