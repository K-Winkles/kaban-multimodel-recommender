It's perfect for the warmer seasons because of how light it is. The material is also not rough, but if you're looking for soft and plushy, this isn't for you.We love how light and breathable it is since we got it for our 16 month old daughter's room. We wanted something that would be light enough for her to be able to cover and uncover herself throughout the night.Out of the packaging, there are a lot of wrinkles, but that is easily fixed after running it through the washer and dryer. It fits great on her twin bed. Overall, we are very pleased with the product and believe that it's worth the money.",
