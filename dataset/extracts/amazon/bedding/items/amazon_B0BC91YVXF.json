                "reviewText": "It's starting to get hot where I live and although this set looks thick and fluffy, it's lightweight and cooling; this set is good for all year round.The material is soft to the touch and it's beautifully and simply made.I would have given it 5 stars had I not found a small hole in the flat sheet and the extra strings dangling off the comforter, but I was so happy with the set that it didn't push me to send it back for a replacement.As long as it wasn't the comforter that had the hole in it, I'm okay.Just be aware that there's a possibility you might end up with a flat or fitted sheet with a hole in it.I was well aware of that, but I still took the risk and sure enough I got a hole in mine... It's no problem to me, but if you don't want to take that 50/50 risk I suggest you go with another set.This set is very nice though, so in my opinion it was worth the risk.",
