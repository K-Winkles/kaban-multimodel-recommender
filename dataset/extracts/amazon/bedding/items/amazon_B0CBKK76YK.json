Plenty big enough to cover my king size bed. The cotton is soft and comfortable to sleep against. The filing did seem to fluff up a bit in the dryer and make it even more snuggly. We immediately bought two more in the same size and color! We are letting our new puppy sleep with us, and I\u2019m washing bedding every 2 days! Love my puppy, don\u2019t love the hair she leaves behind!Overall it\u2019s a solid comforter. Well worth the cost. It washes beautifully and dries beautifully.",

It\u2019s lightweight and breathable but also somehow really warm on cold nights!!! 100% cotton so it\u2019s soft and easy to wash and gentle on sensitive skin! I seriously couldn\u2019t love this set more. Do yourself a favor and buy it!!!",

                "reviewText": "Quality sheets, Beautiful color,100 % cotton, Comfortable, We purchased them for upcoming trip to our son's house. Had them shipped to his house because he didn't have any sheets for a guest bed. Plus i'm picky I like a 100% cotton sheets and comforter. To send a twenty four year old out to try to find that. I would end up with who knows what? He did wash them before we arrived. He didn't use any fabric softener. Also some cheap off brand washing detergent. So they were a little stiff, but you could tell it was because they were new. I'm sure after a few more washes they will be absolutely perfect texture. Very well made. I was not hot. Beautiful color. I loved everything about these sheets and i'm very Particular about my bedding. I'm giving it a five star. If you're looking for true one hundred percent cotton sheets here they are.",

Like other reviews, I can confirm it is wrinkly which is not my personal preference but it\u2019s light weight and SUPER cozy so I decided to put it under my other set. I have it layered up and my bed feels so comfy now! For the price it\u2019s a great set if you don\u2019t mind the wrinkles. I just purchased one for my daughter too. She laid down in my bed and set it felt so comfortable and wanted one. I hope they make this in white soon so I can purchase another for my son\u2019s room!",
