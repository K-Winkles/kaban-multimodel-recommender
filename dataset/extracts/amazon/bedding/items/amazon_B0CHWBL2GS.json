I thought about buying the California king, but comparing the measurements provided online, it didn\u2019t seem much different so it didn\u2019t seem worth the extra money.

Instead, I will say my favorite thing is the AMAZING texture of the comforter.It is like a cloud in its absolute softness. I love how cool to the touch it is, so it doesnt leave you sweating all night long under the blankets with an arm and a leg drapped over the edge in a vain attempt to keep cool... but it keeps you nice and warm in the same token as well because of how insulating it is, you don't feel like you need to have any throw blankets on top to keep your heat in.It is also surprisingly lightweight, with an amazing texture and feel to it, but offers a decent amount of weight while under it too. Making those of us who appreciate heavier blankets, happy as a clam. Either way, I will definitely be buying another set!",
