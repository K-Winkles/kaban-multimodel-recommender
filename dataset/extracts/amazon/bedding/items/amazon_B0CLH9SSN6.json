                "reviewText": "So far so good. I had been looking at this bed for awhile, but it was over 70$ and I didn't want to spend that much. I kept checking and one day there weren't any full size available. A couple weeks later I checked it again and it was about 50$ so I got immediately. Glad I did! My son loves Bluey. He calls it his Bluey guitar bed. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0fIdk. The comforter is thick and the characters are a vibrant color. It appears to be good quality material, overall. But my 5-year-old loves it \u263a\ufe0f. I'll post and update after the first wash.",
