Here we are months later and he\u2019s still using the same bed set. It is still in perfect condition and he loves his blankie/bed set. Each night he\u2019s excited to go to bed with PJ mask (his favorite). I even incorporated this bed set into potty training - \u201cyou don\u2019t want to pee on your best friend PJ mask do you?\u201d (He says everything he loves is his \u201cbest friend\u201d LOL). We\u2019ve yet to have an accident! This bed set is soft, durable, super cute, altogether a great purchase and it wasn\u2019t too expensive, either. I\u2019ve washed these several times - they have kept the same quality through washes, doesn\u2019t fade, doesn\u2019t rip Easy, and the comforter is nice and thick for the cold winter days & nights.",
