I love that it has a zipper to keep the insert in. I should have gotten the one with the white accents but this one makes me feel like I am in a hotel for sure. Super soft. Only complaint is that after the firs wash the super soft design turns into this wool ballesc type of texture, Kind of like the inside of a fleece sweatshirt after a while, it\u2019s still soft but just not like after you wash and air-dry other things.",
