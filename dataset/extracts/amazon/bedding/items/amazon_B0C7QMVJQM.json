The bedding is pretty soft and comfortable. It seems to be pretty well made with no loose threads anywhere. It\u2019s not too heavy or too thin either, I think it\u2019ll keep him perfectly warm at night. This is a super cute set! It seems worth the money to me, I would recommend this!",

It\u2019s been washed a handful of times and hasn\u2019t faded or broken down during those washes. Great set.",
