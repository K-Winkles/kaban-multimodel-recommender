My daughter always looks so comfy in her bed with this set! Would definitely purchase again!!!**Update:Almost 2 years after purchasing this set, I wouldn\u2019t change the 5 star rating! I still absolutely love this set. Every time I put this set in our daughter\u2019s bed, it makes me smile lol!We are going on the third child to use this set, and it is still as awesome as when we bought it! The color is still SUPER vibrant and the comforter is soft and still as plush as when it was brand new (just keep in mind it IS a toddler set, so when I say plush, I\u2019m not comparing to a queen/king size plush comforter. I\u2019m comparing it to another toddler bedding set we purchased. This one FAR EXCEEDS the softness/plushness of the other set!). If you\u2019re looking for a really cute, bright toddler set with owls, give this a try!!!",

It doesn't smell bad like chemicals and it feels like regular sheets should feel, smooth/soft. My toddler was very excited to have her \"big girl blanket\". It's not really my style but I figure I can buy a duvet cover and the other stuff even cheaper later on and right now she has two sets of this for $40. A comforter alone typically costs that much. 10/10 cheap and decent.",

The bed spread IS thin as some other customers mentioned, but it's just thick enough. Perfect and so cute.",

One side of the comforter has owls and animals on it, and the other is plainer -- just shapes, basically. It's very cute, and fits with her room really well. The comforter isn't heavy at all, so it wouldn't be good for cold houses; but we live in Tennessee and keep our house fairly warm so it's perfect. Just heavy enough to keep her warm, but not so heavy as to make her hot. (She runs hot anyway, so something too heavy wouldn't work.)",

She immediately fell in love with everything about the comforter, fitted sheet and pillowcase. She loves owls and just points at each one and says owl, owl owl! We didn't know if she was ready for a full size pillow but it has ended up working out great, we bought a very flat pillow, and with it being full size her head didn't fall off of it during the night like it normally did with her toddler pillow.Another positive, the sheets and comforter are all incredibly soft, and the comforter is the perfect density, it isn't too thick or too thin. After washing everything remained just as soft, the comforter didn't bunch at all afterwards.Would definitely buy again, and when she moves on to a twin bed we will definitely buy from this company.",
