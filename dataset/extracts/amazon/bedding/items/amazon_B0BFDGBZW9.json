It keeps me so warm and cozy while not being super heavy. The look of it is super nice as well! I do agree, it is a little short on the width, but that is my only complaint and I don't even care!",

I washed it straight out of the box and when it was dry, there wasn\u2019t any extra wrinkles or issues. Looks great!",

The pattern is beautiful and adds something extra. The material is soft and light weight but still keeps me warm. I get cold easily, especially in the winter months so this is perfect. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the sizing. I ordered at California King sized comforter because I wanted it to fit oversized on my King sized mattress. However, it fits my bed like a regular King comforter would. Also I recommend washing it before putting it on your bed (I hope most do this anyway). My comforter had an overpowering smell. It was like a eucalyptus type of scene or something that reeeeaaaally opened up my sinuses. It wasn't unbearable but it was very strong that it kind of took my breath away. LITERALLY! Aside from those 2 things, I love it!!!!",

I wanted to be sure it fit well and wasn't too short on the sides. This worked out well. At first I was surprised at how thin it seemed and had concerns, but it is actually warmer than a pretty heavy quilt I was using prior. It is cozy and squishy and honestly it looks great too! My apartment is pretty eclectic and 'boho' and I love a lot of color. The one I got now is hunter green and I am thinking about another color to change things up. I am very happy.",
