I'm not sure this is going to be cool enough, but I'm still hopeful. If not, I still love it and will just take it off the bed overnight and put it back on when the bed is made. The pillow sham fits a standard pillow very well. In fact, my regular pillow is pretty fat and it still fit nice. It is light in weight and generally I think it is well suited for summer unless you live in a place like Florida where it would only work if you had air conditioning. If you want a cheerful bedroom, this will work perfectly for you.",

I needed something quick, so I just read the reviews & ordered this hoping it would be soft & not so heavy. She is at that tween age where I can't get her any of the old standbys like Minnie or Disney princess or My little pony because she is past all that! So I was hoping these cute little owls would be girly yet not too little kiddish. My bet paid off! (Victory dance!) She LOVES this set! It is so cute & pink on one side so when you fold it back it makes a very lovey accent color. The pillow shams are also pink on one side. Super soft & light weight. The perfect set for my picky tween.",

                "reviewText": "I really liked the vibrant colors & super softness! It is very thin, but that is great for our Florida climate! I have only washed it once so far, but no issue with fading or anything else. If you are looking for a cute, soft bedspread ( more like a \"coverlet\") to perk up your child's bed this is great, if you are looking for any kind of warmth this is not a good choice.",

I wanted something bigger than just a throw blanket and a saw this in a twin size. Not only is it the perfect size, but it is the softest quilt I've ever felt! And it's so pretty that it just helps me mentally feel better I believe. I love it to much. It also comes with a matching pillow sham. I may have to order another just to put into storage for whenever this one wears out!",
