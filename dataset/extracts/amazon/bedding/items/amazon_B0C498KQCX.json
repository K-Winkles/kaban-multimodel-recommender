It isn't a hair magnet and hair will brush off both sides. The warm/winter side is a velvet texture and I sweat the 3 nights I used it and I typically sleep with a sheet, fleece blanket, and a thin comforter in the winter. This was hotter than that. I tried using a sheet to make it a bit cooler and that worked but it was still too hot for me. I just slept with the summer/cool side and a sheet and it was perfect for me. Not sure how it'll be in the summer if you don't have an ac blowing on you all night but that's how I sleep so this will be perfect. Washing is also simple and it holds up well after first wash. Did smell funny right out of packaging so I washed it before use. Lightweight but also thick.",
