The blanket is true to the print advertised, and I think it\u2019s a good middle of the line quality as far as the stuffing of the blanket goes. I\u2019ve washed it once and it held up well. I hang dried it to make sure no breakdown of materials on the inside. It\u2019s light enough to use year round, but warm enough that it doesn\u2019t need a second blanket in winter.",
