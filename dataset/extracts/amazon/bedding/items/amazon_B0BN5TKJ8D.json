                "reviewText": "So I purchased this based on all the amazing ratings. I have never had much luck buying bedding online but this comforter really takes the cake. Now firs off I want to tell you to ignore all the comments that say it does not fit right or the comforter looks different than the one pictured! The reason for the people claiming that they did not get the same comforter that was pictured is because on the add page where you select your color there are two different types of comforters for each color. One looks exactly as the one listed in the first set of pictures you get and further over on the color/style selection area there is the same color comforter but it is a reversable blanket and has a different design vs what is first pictured. As far as the people complaining it only hangs an inch off the bed it is because they have placed the blanket on the wrong direction exsp the king size blankets. The tag should be hanging off to the side of the bed and not on at the foot of the bed like you would think. Doing this will give you plenty of hang on each side as well as the bottom this is something most people don't realize when it comes to some comforters the longer side goes across the bed when it comes to certain style blankets no matter where the tag is located as you can see from my of the king I bought I have plenty of over hang on each side and at the food of the bed and I have enough blanket left to reach the head board and roll back. And as far as the wrinkles go, ours was not to bad but a quick tumble dry with the steam setting in the washer made it look nice and neat.I love the two tone color effect and the stitched pleats that are at regular intervals across the blanket, it adds nice texture to it. The blanket is super soft and stays cool yet for people who are cold natured like my husband it keeps you very warm. Like most couples and as many have stated in their reviews me and my husband never agree on blankets but we are both loving this one. I love the silky feeling you get when you rub the outside of the blanket against the fill which stays in place and does not clump in one area. I love that it is also supper fluffy yet not to bulky. This blanket helps you maintain the perfect temps during sleep keeping you comfortable no matter if you like it cold or warm this blanket has you covered. It is very well made and my cats love it to. I have not been able to get the out of bed since I put it on the bed yesterday after a wash. They are all nested up in it being lazy.I can't say anything bad about this blanket and we will be purchasing two more in different colors because I like to change up my bed colors ever few weeks or so. You are going to love this blanket and last but not least at check out you can clip a 20% off coupon and apply it at check out lowering the price even more. To be honest I would have paid $100=$200 for this blanket because it is totally worth it! It like 5 star hotel quality bedding at a discount store price! So if you have been looking for the perfect blanket that is affordable but does not lack on comfort because of the low price then look no further! Stop reading my review right now and add it to your basket already! Why are you still reading? Go buy it already! Seriously Stop reading and click add to cart you will be glad you did!",

                "reviewText": "We have been looking for a larger comforter, and this is the best! We absolutely love how light this is but still keeps you warm. It does seem to collect the dog hair more than other comforters. It is extremely soft and easy to wash. It takes longer to dry but can be easily fluffed up by shaking it out once a week. Highly recommend this for anyone looking for a good quality comforter.",

                "reviewText": "Great buy. When searching we saw that the price was right and the products seemed to be of high quality. I was hoping for matching bedsheets to be offered with the set as well, the only reason for 4 stars. Otherwise, we've had one night's use with this set and we're pleased. The comforter is very soft and comfortable, it doesn't get too hot or too cold and you can feel the cool touch on your skin when getting into bed. My wife said I slept through the night more soundly, i.e., I didn't snore lol. I'm not sure if that was because of the comfort of the set or the pillows we purchased along with it from Amazon Basics, but overall we had a more restful night.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this in grey when I had a queen bed, and I loved it so much, when I upgraded to a king size bed I had to get one for that too in blue. These are my favourite comforters, the colours are absolutely stunning, they are so soft and lightweight and hold up extremely well! I wash them and dry them no problem there's been no bunching, no lint, no threads at all! They are perfect for summer, and I'm an extremely claustrophobic person so although I like to be warm and cozy in the winter, I don't like heavy blankets! So I just put a fleece blanket on top of my sheets with this on top and K find it perfectly warm for winter.They are on the thinner side, not paper thin though, but the quality and feel is unbeatable! And the price is great. I don't think anyone would be disappointed in these. I'm very picky and am not happy with a lot of things, but this I love! Want to get more in different colours now too",

Blanket keeps you nice and warm despite being so light. Husband says Very smooth and has a nice texture. We got the light grey colour and true to image on website. Arrived very quickly within a few days. I hope to buy another one",

Super soft as reviews say and seems to be well made with stitching etc. Very light weight compared to my current mattress which I am not used to but nice for warmer nights to not be as hot. Only complaint so far as only 3 days with it is that the thickness in pictures to actual is 50%. Its so thin and pictures in ad very much overstate how thick it truly is. The thin or lack of packing inside is only complaint as it makes it seem cheaper a bit but how thin is it. Except 50% less than what you see in pictures. Pillow cases fit nice size too.",
