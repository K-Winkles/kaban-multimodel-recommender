                "reviewText": "Not the best quilt I've had, but still nice. Its lightweight so I layer with other blankets. The design is printed on and it's only \"quilted\" with a straight stitch in one direction, no baffling. Fyi, the color is more a bright blue (like \"Duke blue\" for those on the east coast) not navy. I ordered the king size for my queen bed so it would drape over the sides which it does nicely. The matching sheets are my favorite part as they make it really cozy on cold nights.",

I have an Ethan Allen Country Craftsman Queen bed with a super thick mattress topper. It came up a little short, so I exchanged it for a KING and it works very well. Looks really nice and also bought the flannel sheet set for winter.",
