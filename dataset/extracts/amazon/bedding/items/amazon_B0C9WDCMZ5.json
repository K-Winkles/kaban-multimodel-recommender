I do wish it came with a matching sheet, but that\u2019s not a deal breaker for us. The blanket feels so soft. It goes perfectly with his theme. The comforter it\u2019s heavy at all & keeps him warm through the night.",

                "reviewText": "It seems like I\u2019m always changing my children\u2019s sheets, comforters and pillow cases. Kids can just get dirty and so can their sheets. I like to have spares of all of those items so I don\u2019t have have to stress if the sheets need to be changed an hour before bedtime. I picked up this comforter set with the pillow case in the twin size for my kid\u2019s beds. I washed it separately and didn\u2019t follow any special instructions, and it came out well, with no issues. The comforter is soft and plush, and the design is nicely done without any messed up printing. The pillow case is the same, being very soft and with perfect designs all over. It\u2019s made well and hasn\u2019t torn, ripped or lost threads over the last few months that my kids have used it, and that\u2019s a true testament to the durability of the bedding. This bedding would make a nice gift for a child as it\u2019s available in a few different designs, or it would be a great item to purchase for your children\u2019s bed, happy with this purchase!",
