At first glace I was disappointed that the colors were not as bold as they looking online. I opened each pack, all three were soft. I washed in cold water and dried, dryer then while still a litte damp I hung on the line,before I put on the beds. No fade in color and still soft, well made and decent sturdy material. The next day I put each one on the beds. I was impressed! Each bedroom looked beautiful! I had a queen comforter for the duvet; the zipper opening was wide enough to accommodate the comforter and it was easy to match the corners and shake into to place. I like the softness and the quality of the material, and very little wrinkles.",

Cheaper duvets use material so thin, you can see the pattern of the comforter inside if you don\u2019t use a down insert but not this one. The duvet zippers shut, the zipper is hidden well and the material is very soft. I think its a very cost effective duvet set if you want to makeover your bed on a budget! I\u2019m very pleased! I\u2019m not sure how it washes up, but I will update if it needs to be discussed further.",

This cover in terracotta is so wonderful, warm, sturdy, and matches my esthetic perfectly! There is a zipper and straps all on the inside that will secure the cover in place and its definitely holding up. I've had this for a little over a month and I've washed it as well. It holds up in the wash just fine. My large dog has tried digging at it and it hasn't ripped at all (if it did, would definitely be the dogs fault). My husband was so hesitant at first becuase duvets seem very difficult to get on, but the inside out and roll method worked perfectly.I would definitely reccomend and I will be buying in the sage green color soon!",

I didn\u2019t expect much because of the price point, compared to others I was looking at but wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted this look so figured I\u2019d try this one and I absolutely love it! It\u2019s so fresh and clean looking. The quality is great! I\u2019ve already washed it several times and it\u2019s held up wonderfully! I love that it has ties for the duvet in each corner to keep everyone in place as well as a zipper closure that\u2019s discreet. It\u2019s super soft, cozy and inviting. It lays beautifully on the bed and looks fantastic. I couldn\u2019t be happier with this purchase. It transformed the look of the room in a quick, simple and inexpensive way. I waited a couple of months to post my review to make sure it held up well and it has. I highly recommend it.",
