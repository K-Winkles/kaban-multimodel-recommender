                "reviewText": "How pleased I am to receive such a nice product at a reasonable price! The box for this product felt surprisingly heavy, for just a mattress pad. I opened the Amazon box to discover the pad was boxed within a manufacturer box. When I opened that, I found the mattress pad was vacuum wrapped in plastic - sealed in airtight. When I cut the seal open, the mattress pad immediately puffed up! It still felt dense and weighty. Once fully opened, the mattress pad was soft and nicely fluffy. Though not as thick as manufacturer photos might suggest (although to be honest it might actually look like that if it went from factory straight to a bed), it had surprising loft to it. The pad went on the bed easily and was a nice fit - pretty exact with no excess \u201chang over\u201d. I initially thought, when I ordered it that it might be too deep for my 12\u201d memory foam mattress but it wasn\u2019t. The side depth allowed me to tuck it in well and smoothly. It looked and felt nice on the bed, even once the sheet was on.I normally would have felt I needed to wash this before use but the way it was vacuum sealed made me feel comfortable putting it right on the bed.Seldom do products like this measure up to the photos but in this case I was happily surprised. I\u2019m very pleased with the product, would recommend it, and will be happy my visiting son will enjoy a nice bed.",

I needed a little padding as my extra firm mattress has changed for me. I needed extra firm due to my back probs. But now that my back is better the firmness is a bit much, so I needed something with a little thickness and this was it, it is prefect. When I opened it I threw it in the dry for about 10 minutes and it fluffed up nicely. I would not put it on the bed without doing this as you may not get the full effect of the topper. It needs to be fluffed up in the dryer.All in all I really like this, it works perfect for me.",

                "reviewText": "If you\u2019ve never had an experience with a mattress topper, this is my second experience. I bought this under the intention of replacing my current mattress topper that is truly, SUPER SOFT, and filled my intention of having a plush, super soft mattress topper. My current \u201ctopper\u201d, no longer - I said bye-bye to it - was all I had hoped since I have a firm mattress, and no plush top. The brand I had is no longer made.Age and washing my current mattress topper is why I am looking for a new topper. The mattress topper was super heavy and barely made it to my washing machine and should\u2019ve gone to a commercial washer but I loved it and I had a few years and it was truly, plush, thick and super soft!!!I will keep this Mateby version. I am adding other layers on top of this Mateby topper to further protect the mattress topper and mattress and add \u201csoft & plush \u201c levels. Hence, I am OK with keeping this, but it is good, barely 2.5 stars, I am generous and gave it 3 stars.I was looking for a soft mattress topper, but not as thick as what I had on my bed, which was a good 3 inches of soft, fluffy, thick filling. This mattress topper you\u2019re looking at is not thick, barely soft, nor super fluffy. I would say it\u2019s barely 1 inch thick, if that, and loosely filled. How can you tell this just looking at the information THEY, the manufacturer, provide?Do your homework. Look at the weight of the product and the GSM of a product, what is GSM? Grams/square meter. GSM will tell you how thick a product is, how heavy a product is, how durable a product is, how thick it is or verify what the manufacturer says it is. The GSM on this product is pretty low and indicates to me it is not thick or push. My goal was to have a soft, not super plush/heavy topper that is easier to handle and wash in a home washing machine, and add other protective layers on top of the topper to help with the softness and protection. Do not trust that this will protect your mattress. Don\u2019t read everything that the manufacture tells you. They list in the title \u201cprotector\u201d it does not protect. Look at the info below:\u201cWater resistance level\u201d: Not water resistant. \u201cSpecial Feature:\u201d Durability, ResistantResistant to what? Stupid people?I\u2019m adding another layer of protection over this for cooling and breathability and protects everything underneath it including my mattress. This \u201ctopper\u201d is not a mattress protector. I don\u2019t feel it is, I read it isn\u2019t, and now know it more so, owning this product.It serves, my purpose, could be a little bit more plush and fluffy, is 4.8 lbs so I knew it was easy to handle and wasn\u2019t as thick. You can see that in the information, but, their \u201cnew version\u201d is over 10 pounds, which tells me it\u2019s most likely thicker and plush. It screams it from the info they provided and it\u2019s on sale. Go get the new version if you are looking for a thick, plush, soft, and that it meets OKEO standards.The bottom line, this product is barely soft and plush. If you\u2019re looking for soft and plush, this product is not for you. If you\u2019re looking for cotton, this product is not for you. I love cotton, this product is OK at best. I prefer cotton. This version/brand is a topper and barely serves its purpose the manufacturer is telling you \u201cbelieve us.\u201d Definitely not a mattress protector, nor should you expect it to help your back problems.DO. YOUR. HOMEWORK. Everyone has different needs. Look at the info they provide, the best and worst reviews and go with what\u2019s best for your goals. You might have to invest more money, but in the end it\u2019ll be worth it for you. People saying this is super plush and soft; not even close!!!You owe it to yourself to invest your time, research, since most of these manufacturers have contradictions and lies in their copy. This one does. Some of the reviews are horrifying - pray that is not you, scary. Good luck!",
