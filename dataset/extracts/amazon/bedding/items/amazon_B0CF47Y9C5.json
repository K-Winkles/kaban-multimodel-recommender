We noticed immediately upon opening that it was not all horribly wrinkled like most and the fact it was still nice and warm on the bed but did not feel like it was pinning you to the bed like some. The seams were all sewn well, the fabric was luxurious and the price unbelievable so this make for an easy 5 Star rating.",

                "reviewText": "This comforter is light weight, and soft to the touch. It keeps you plenty warm in the winter. It washes and dries well. It's not quite so wrinkle free. I steam ironed the shams to get rid of wrinkles, haven't done the comforter yet, put it on the bed hoping the wrinkles would work their way out. The shams hold a standard size pillow with a zipper to hold the pillow in place.",
