                "reviewText": "I was looking for a beautiful set of bed linen. I didn\u2019t regret the purchase at all, the fabric is incredibly adaptable to the body, the stitching is just perfect, all the seams are even, the threads don\u2019t stick out, the color is as in the photo. I\u2019ve already washed it and it hasn\u2019t faded at all. Overall, I\u2019m delighted! And the packaging is very beautiful. My parents bought a new apartment and are in need of renovations, so I think I\u2019ll give them the same set as a housewarming gift. And I will definitely order myself another one in a different color.",

It has a velvet type fabric backing that is soft, but makes this heavier than your usual quilt of this type. This is a soft fabric with nice stitching. It washed easily, but took a little bit to dry. It hangs over my king bed about 8\" on each side. This is a super good value at $25.",

I also wanted something that I was able to wash in my washer and dry in my dryer, in other words low maintenance! I washed as directions it came with. Cold water, and low heat to dry, well I dryer in low medium. Took awhile to dry, but well worth it! It is so soft and fluffy! Also , warm but not hot!! Ity so comfortable! I love getting in bed at night! Especially now that it is so chilly at night now. The color was a little darker than I wanted, but as much as I love it I can live with it. Oh, I have a queen size bed with a thick mattress and it fits perfectly on my bed. Really good buy, great quality!",

It doesn't hang down over the sides as much as I would like, but most do not these days. It was very wrinkled when it came out of the package, but I gave it a sprinkle of water and tumbled on low in my dryer, and that took care of most of the wrinkles. Nice set for the money.",

I purchased the cream colored Bedding set with sheets included for my guestroom.I have purchased a LOT of expensive bedding in my day and let me tell you this is way better in terms of softness and comfort. I perfer this to my own $400 Clavin Klein bedding set i purchased 8 years ago!!It is so simple yet luxurious feeling, that you can't believe its not a designer brand. Everytime a guest stays over or I take a nap a very nice compliment is made on the bedding.I am also very pleasently surprised that it holds up in the winter, so it really holds in heat withour feeling heavy.Upon close inspection, the stitching is not perfect, so maybe thats why it has such a low pricepoint? Who cares, it's still a gem of a find!",
