                "reviewText": "I ordered two of these twin comforter sets. They are from China. The box they came from the factory in did not indicate size. The labels on the pieces did not indicate size. Whenever I opened the sheet sets I found that one package contained one pillow case and one package contained two pillow cases! Well, then I had a dilemma. Typically twin sheet sets come with one pillowcase. So I was afraid that perhaps the set containing two pillowcases may have been a full-size set. Upon comparing the top sheets I found them to be the same size. I guess I just lucked out getting an extra case. The sheets are 100% polyester. I ordered the gray set and was surprised to find my lint trap on my dryer full of material after washing the sheets. That seems odd to me as I haven't experienced that with polyester fabric before. I do like the look of the comforters and pillow shams. They have a woven linen look to them.",
