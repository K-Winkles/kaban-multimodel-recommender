I didn\u2019t remember reading that in the description and was worried they would be like other microfiber sheets that I\u2019ve purchased and have a weird feel to them. They are not like that! They feel so nice and are made well. I was concerned about one review saying that they rip easily. While they are a little thinner, I don\u2019t think that would happen easily. They stay on the mattress and there are 4 pillowcases! For the price, you just can\u2019t beat them!",

                "reviewText": "...these really are great sheets and, by comparison, a GREAT value. I've never bought sheets based on a thread count and am wondering now what I've been missing out on. These casually mention an 1800 thread count if you read far enough. They use the term \"microfiber\" a time or two. To me microfiber brings up a mental comparison of either a microfiber towel and its low-pile loops or a microfiber cloth that comes with your glasses or camera lens to clean them... which is almost a little leathery like a chamois. These sheets are neither. They are simply amazingly \"soft\".They seem very well made. The fitted sheet is very deep... at first, I actually thought it was going to be too deep for my mattress. (It was, but it actually sinched up nicely underneath the mattress and wound up being a non-issue).I wound up buying two sets of these and am very happy with the purchase. For the price, give them a shot... I bet you will be just as pleased as me!",
