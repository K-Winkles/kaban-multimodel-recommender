Plus they always seemed to coated in dog hair (could have just been because those were black so the hair was more noticeable).This one on the other hand, as stood up pretty well to the test of two dogs. There is one tiny hole, but otherwise it has held up!It soft, it keeps me warm, easy to wash, what's not to love!If you're a dog person/family and are on the fence, give it a go!",
