I liked all the color options, but I went with the burnt orange, which is the perfect terra-cotta color. It comes vacuum-sealed. I almost could not believe they fit everything in such a tiny box until I opened it. The comforter isn't as thick as it appears in the product images. It's a decent blanket, but I live in the Midwest so I keep a fluffy blanket underneath it for some extra warmth. Overall, definitely worth the purchase.",

                "reviewText": "With winter setting in, I wanted to get a new comforter for my son's room. This was a nice color and included a full sheet set so I went for it.This is a full bed in a bag set. It includes a queen fitted sheet, a top sheet, 4 pillow chases and of course the comforter. The sheets are a polyester material and do not appear to be that high of a thread count as the light easly shines through them, but they are somewhat soft. The comforter, however, appears to be very soft and warm. It's a good size and looks good after a quick wash.As for making the bed, the fitted sheet doesn't have any additional elastic to secure the deep pocket corners other than the eleastic at the edge of the pocket. The pillow cases fit queen sized pillows, but it takes some effort to get a pillow into the case. The flat top sheet is a good size as is the comforter and no problems at all getting them straight on the bed.I have chosen to rate this product 4 stars. Overall, I picked this set up for the comforter and the sheets were a bonus. I really like the comforter and the sheets make a good backup set. At this price point, I'd recommend them for anybody looking for a new set.Criteria for Stars:1 - Total rip off, doesn't perform basic advertised functions or not product advertised. I would likely RETURN and would NEVER recommend.2 - Not worth the money. Performs some of the basic advertised functions, but likely not all, and ultimately was deemed as not providing enough value for the money spent. I would not buy again, and would likely not recommend unless the buyer had a very specific use case.3 - It performs the basic functions as advertised, and has some usefulness at the price point, but doesn't work for all of the reasons I purchased. I would likely not buy again, and would only recommend if buyer understood usefulness limitations.4 - It performs most all of the features I purchased it for, but has limitations. I would likely buy again and would recommend.5 - Completely as advertised and likely exceeded expectations. Is if high quality and well shipped. I would totally buy again and recommend.",
