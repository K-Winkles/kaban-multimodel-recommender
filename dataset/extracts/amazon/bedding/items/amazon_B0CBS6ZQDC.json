Makes me want more colors lol It\u2019s the perfect amount of thickness when the filling inside expands. So don\u2019t judge it from the first day..give it a few days and you will be happy with your purchase.",

I washed this set one time and some of the pinched fabric came off and the cotton was balling up so it took some pulling to straighten it out. I mean it was a great price but I should have just spent a little more for better quality. Can\u2019t return because it\u2019s washed already or else I would. It\u2019s thickness will do for the fall but definitely not warm enough for winter. I don\u2019t recommend.",
