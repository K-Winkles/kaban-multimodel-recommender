I read the few other reviews and decided to heck with it, it would be a much smaller loss if I didn't like it than one of the others.Honestly, I love it! The blanket is decent quality. The stitching is nice and tight. Accurate to the photo as well. Looks lovely in the crib. The sheet was as expected as well. I'm not one to really use crib skirts, but I decided to go ahead and give this one a go. It definitely ties the look together, though my particular crib isn't the most skirt-friendly. But eh, whatever, it still looks fine.Pleasantly surprised! I'd recommend it to anyone else on the fence and looking to find something nice without breaking the bank.",
