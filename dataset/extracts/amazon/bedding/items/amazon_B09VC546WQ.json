My pictures don't do it justice.It comes in sort of a vacuum sealed bag, so you'll want to wash and dry it before using. This makes it nice and fluffy again, softer, gets the wrinkles out well too. The comforter is a good thickness, stitching is good quality, and fabric is as well.My one small complaint is that the top sheet only has the pattern on the front side of the fabric. But this is common in top sheets, you'll just want to put the wrong side facing the comforter so when you fold it back you see the pattern.All in all, great bedding. My toddler loves it.",
