I'm seriously considering buying a couple more in different colors just so i have them for when im ready to change things up. I'm so picky with textures and the weight of my blankets so its not always easy finding a comforter thats JUST right, but this one is literally perfect",

I was not disappointed!! This item is super soft, lightweight and beautifully designed. I do personally recommend, if you have a twin sized bed, buy the full sized comforter; if you have a queen sized bed buy the king sized comforter and etc.",

Very soft, was not wrinkled, and looks so good on my bed. I ordered the king size and am very pleased. We will see how it looks once it is washed. But coming out of the package it is very pretty. The price is just crazy for this quality of a light comforter. Can't go wrong.",

Over the holidays I stayed with them and she gave me her room, so I had an opportunity to experience it myself. I'm a hot sleeper and this was perfect, warm enough on the cooler nights and comfy on the warmer nights. It's a great weight and looks nice. My son really liked it too, so I got him the king size grey one for his birthday.",

I actually thought that because of the package size I was going to return it because I doubted it would be the fluffy blanket I pictured. Well it was vacuum sealed and puffed right up. I couldn't believe how comfortable it was. I actually used it as a pillow and a blanket it was that cozy. I now look forward to crawling into bed. Seems to be made very well for the price. It's lightweight but fluffy and it is perfect to keep you warm but not be suffocating. LOVE.",

It covers the king size bed well - if you feel like it's not a good fit, try rotating 90 degrees. Though very lightweight - maybe a bit lighter than I prefer - the comforter is plenty warm. I've been using an electric blanket on some cover nights and found that the electric blanket was too much warmth with this comforter. It's very pretty and really pleasantly soft to the touch.",
