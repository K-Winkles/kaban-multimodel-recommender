                "reviewText": "I have used this consistent for two months and it is great quality for the price. Does not fade in the wash and the comforter is extremely warm. The fabric is soft and not scratchy and it looks exactly as pictured. The flat sheet is also nice and thick for a flat sheet so it also keeps you nice and warm during the night. Depending on the temperature of your bedroom you might wake up sweating as I have done a few times but I then just switch my comforter for the flat sheet and I am good to go.Definitely worth buying.",

                "reviewText": "I was killing myself trying to find a comforter set for my daughter. She recently just for a new bedroom set and I needed a new comforter set since we upgraded to a queen size bed. I looked everywhere and i wanted her to have the last say since it's her room. So she picked the mint.... I was so nervous but relieved we finally narrowed it down. Price wasn't a option while hunting I searched high and low, but her heart was set on this. Okay back to the nervous feeling. I thought the color was going to be too loud and I also thought based on its price point I thought it would be a very flimsy set.....wrong. The color was a soft almost pistachio color. So soft, very classy and I was shocked! The quality was really impressive. I also got the gray leaf set for my son. I'm still amazed how beautiful and soft and warm they are but still cool enough for summer. Does that make sense? Lol. I washed on cold water, delicate and dried on normal. No issues at all. I would definitely buy again.",
