It came shrink wrapped of course, so when I pulled it out, it looked very cheap and lightweight, like a set of thin sheets. However, once it puffed out and lay on the bed for a day.... it is really stunning! That was unexpected. And sleeping under it is like sleeping in a cloud. I might buy more linens from this company!",

The sheet have a nice sheen to them but they produce a lot of lint. I have never had that happen before so I'm not sure how it's doing it but every morning I wake up with blue lint balls on my pajamas. They're not terrible but if I purchase the sheets again it would probably be for a guest room, not for my primary bed room. And if you're wondering I did wash them before I use them.",
