                "reviewText": "I\u2019ll try to be as quick as possible. We have an adjustable base so our old sheets always came off and made us really hot. We ended up getting sheet stays and these sheets.In summary, we love these!Not in summary: These are MUCH cooler (as in, they keep us cool while sleeping) and they are kinda slick. Almost like silk but not. They are strong. Easy to clean. And we love the texture.The only problem was the non-fitted sheet. It never stayed tucked into the bed, even by the feet. We would wake up in the AM and most of it would be hanging off my side of the bed. It became a hassle to try and keep it on every morning so we stopped using it. Which is okay because we always sleep on top of the non-fitted sheet anyway.Other than that, these sheets are great! Hope this helps!",

But more Ryan and I quality still be comfortable cozy and a nature for the sheets. All in all I highly recommend I have a full size bed and the sheets fit pretty well my mattress is a little bit taller than some mattresses because it's a pillow top cover and for that reason the sheet doesn't quite tuck in on this but it does have plenty of space I can talk that in and have a little extra so I would overall recommend this product and I think the color is great and the softness is great and it works really well",

                "reviewText": "Got a new full size bed and didn\u2019t have any sheets that size so when I realized I needed a set for backup when the main ones needed to be washed I went to order more and they were no longer available. Boy was I glad about that because the ones I had first gotten were horrible quality. So I found these. So many to choose from out there that it came down to color and price. These are great! I really wanted the taupe color but it was almost $10 more expensive. So I went with the turquoise. Which I love but it is so close to the same color as my comforter that I have trouble telling if I have ahold of the sheet. Anyway, these look super luxurious. They are shiny and have a pretty little crinkle trim on them. They aren\u2019t are soft as they look which is actually a good thing. They almost look like silk and they\u2019d be sliding everywhere if they were. They are very soft. They are good quality and there are TONS of colors to choose from. When I realized I needed a backup for my backup sheets I went back to these and the taupe were the same price this time. So I now have 2 sets of these. I\u2019m very pleased with the comfort and quality of these\u2026especially for the price.",

                "reviewText": "These sheets are amazing! I have a thick pillow top mattress and these sheets went on with ease and no struggling. The flat sheet is actually long enough on the sides and bottom to actually tuck in so your bed looks neat. I have Coop pillows which are thick and i struggle with pillows cases, these pillows cases slid right on and have the nice little flat inside so your pillow is completely covered. Super soft and comfortable. I have 3 pairs and will most definitely be buying more!",

But 2 things I would not buy this for daily use: 1) it is too light & and thin so the sheets roll over you when you sleep - especially with hubs next to me 2) a Queen only comes with 2 pillow cases (affordable part) - I give a solid 3.5\u2b50 good bargain!",
