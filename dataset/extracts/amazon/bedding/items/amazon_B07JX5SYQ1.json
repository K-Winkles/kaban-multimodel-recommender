It draped over the sides of the twin bed perfectly. 10/10 recommended!",

This will caused problems with washing. When I have washed comforters like this the filling lymps into balls making the comforter either a dry clean only or a ONE time purchase. For non sewers this IS an issue! For non-sewers or for looks in a spare bedroom this would be OK. Not for daily use though.For sewers it would not take much time to use an embroidery hoop and hand sew or machine stich around the pintucking to stabilize the back to front, taking care to line up the backing with the front.The fabric is very nice. It is soft. I does not have a lot of body though It is a nice weight.The picturing is perfect! I love how it brings texture to an other wise plain set.I still gave this set a 4 out of 5 because It is a bargain for the amount of fabric it takes to make a comforter and pillowcases. The fabric is so pretty! If I washed it and it did get lumpy, the fabric would make a beautiful dress or could be repourposed into many valuable items.",

Little did I know how absolutely amazing it would be to sleep under! The first night after putting it on my bed, I climbed in and felt like I was sleeping under a soft, fluffy cloud!! It is the best comforter I\u2019ve ever purchased! I\u2019ve spent over $400 on the past on a comforter because of the name brand and advertised quality. Honestly, this comforter is MUCH better! I have had it for several months now, so I can attest to how well it washes too. I put it on the normal cycle in my washer, on the medium water setting. I use the normal heat setting in the dryer and it always comes out perfect! No lumps, no rips, just perfect! The pillow shams are an added bonus, as they look so cute with the comforter and wash just as easily. This is probably one of my favorite Amazon purchases!!!",

                "reviewText": "Arrived in a plastic bag that was in a box. Pulled it out of the bag and put it on my king size bed. This is what it looks like not washed yet. I love that it actually hangs over the side quite a bit. Feels super soft, will probably be softer after washing. Feels heavy enough to be a year-round blanket not super light, but not heavy.",
