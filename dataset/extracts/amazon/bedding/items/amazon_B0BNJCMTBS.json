Our comforter set is packed in a vacuum bag, so you can dry them in low heat or tap the comforter gently while baking it in the sun to fluffy again.",
            "EASY CARE- Our bed in a bag is easy to care for, just throw it in the washing machine and wash it in cold water. We recommend machine washing them separately in cold water on a gentle cycle and tumble dry low for optimal maintenance when needed. Allow our comforter sets to consistently provide you and your family with a cozy sleeping experience."

This fit the bill, and I'm glad I picked this set! The Dark Gray is just like the picture. It's super soft and lightweight, but doesn't feel like it would rip/tear easily. No weird smell when I took it out of the package, which I appreciate. The texture is my favorite part! We might have to grab another for our bedroom now.",

HOWEVER, I gave it 3 stars bc it\u2019s not as defined as it is in the picture (style wise). Also I washed it as soon as I got it so I can put it straight to use , and I\u2019ve noticed white streak marks afterwards all on my sheets , at lease the comforter is still okay . But it definitely could\u2019ve been the heat of my washer and dryer ? Not sure \u2026 maybe a delicate wash or a regular wash but not on hot maybe warm and cold? I also didn\u2019t read any tags so it very well could be my doings lol , otherwise it\u2019s cute and comfy I\u2019m NOT COMPLAINING!!",
