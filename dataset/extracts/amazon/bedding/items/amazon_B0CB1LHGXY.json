This is a fantastic blanket all by itself. It is reversible, luxurious, and extra warm. The Utopia queen size blanket 90\" x 90\" has plenty of room for most beds. It is made of top-quality materials to last a long time. This is my go-to blanket for cold nights, or just to cover up in a relaxing chair. I've bought several as they quickly warm you up and they make wonderful gifts. Presently on sale, these are one of the best values you can find. Always check the GSM of a blanket you might purchase. Many are only 300 GSM.",

                "reviewText": "Having owned the same blanket since 2005, I figured it was time for a new blanket. So I started my search. looking for high positive reviews as always, and also the negative. Recently purchased this. Writing this review at the end of 2023. Looking at it up close, it looks the same as my blanket it terms of thickness. For anyone wondering what my old blanket is, it\u2019s a San Marcos original blanket. Made in china. So not an original since the original ones were made in Mexico. No longer made. You can still find companies that make them with similar material and if you don\u2019t mind having an animal or a specific design on the blanket. Warm, heavy blanket I used for all seasons. still have it. Anyways, this one ended up being thinner, maybe just lighter in terms of weight since my old blanket was meant for a bigger bed size and this one I ordered is for a size full bed. It\u2019s definitely nice and warm. Since right now it\u2019s cold, I am using the white fur style material side. It\u2019s warm enough and also having a heater helps. Quality of material feels great. No shedding. even after i washed it first before using it like you always should. Time will tell. I paid 40 plus tax. I was not expecting perfection. I don\u2019t see this lasting the same as my other blanket, but we will see. I ordered the dark green one. Softness, comfort, and light weight, 5 out of 5 from me. Thickness and combined with being warm, 4 out of 5.",

On sale so the price is right. It washed even more fluffy. I purchased tye twin size and it really is. Not like other blankets that arrive and are a stretch from a twin. The 2 layers separate and need to be pulled back together. Hmmmm... I wonder if little pieces of yarn could be swewn in like for older quilts - brought up and down and tied in a knot to keep them together.I am pleased. I didn\u2019t give it a 5 because it is thinner and not as warm. I throw on a \"not quite twin\" blanket on top.",
