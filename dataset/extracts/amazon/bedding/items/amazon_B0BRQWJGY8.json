                "reviewText": "Overall I am happy with this comforter set, but the picture is deceiving. I was expecting the comforter to be extra long on the sides and bottoms and come close to touching the floor. However, it only is about the length of the mattress. I guess I should have pulled out a tape measure. Other that than, it is pretty and soft.",
