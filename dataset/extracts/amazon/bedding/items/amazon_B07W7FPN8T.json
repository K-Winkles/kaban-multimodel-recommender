This hides the tubs I have hidden under my queen size, four poster bed. I love \ud83d\udc95 the extra space under the bed that no one else sees. I read a lot of reviews and tips before laundering and placing on my bed. That is, wash on delicate in cold water without anything else in the washer. Then dry on warm setting without anything else in dryer. I had no wrinkles whatsoever and didn\u2019t iron it. This bedspread couldn\u2019t be more perfect. I put a Shabby Chic brand comforter with pink roses on beige background on top. It\u2019s lovely. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95Mine doesn\u2019t puddle, it comes to 2\u201d from floor. The trick is to measure and remeasure before you buy it. I bought a faux leather foot stool for under $40 to step on when getting into my bed. The bed was my Mother\u2019s so it is important to me to keep it, so beautiful. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95",

                "reviewText": "This is the blush ticking stripe on a Victorian half-tester bed. Arrived very wrinkled, which light dryer tumble and pressing has begun to address. The ticking stripes are printed rather than woven into the fabric, so expect this. Very soft and lightweight, floaty fabric. Batting inside the top layer of the bedspread, so this likely wouldn't be up to a heavy duty wash/spin cycle. I'm going to handle this gently, -- as others have mentioned, it doesn't seem likely to be super durable.For the price, well worth it, if you don't mind maintaining with a little TLC. A pretty, versatile spread to coordinate with quilts or, as here, an eiderdown. Good for layering. I liked it well enough that I ordered another in neutral/natural.Note: I liked this so well I attempted to order a second one in neutral/natural, but I was sent a charcoal gray instead. I have now seen other reviews where this was a problem (including one reviewer who tried three times and repeatedly got the wrong color). So ... caution when ordering \"neutral.\" It may not be what you get.Edit to add: Liked so well I bought another one in tan ticking stripe. So far, the first one I bought has held up extremely well. Washed on delicate cycle, went through dryer alone and came out with minimal wrinkles and top batting in place. With a bit of care and thought, these do well.",

I honestly wasn't sure what to expect with the gray ticking stripe bedding but I had high hopes and let me tell you I was not disappointed. It arrived quickly, I will tell you that it is very wrinkled upon opening (obviously), but after I washed it on my gentle cycle, and dried on low heat I laid it over my bed and steamed the wrinkles right out. The 30\" drop is truly 30\" and fits my tall bed perfectly. I was surprised to find that the topper had a soft fluffy interfacing it it. I assumed it would just be a thin layer of material like the \"skirting\" but it's not. I adore this set and plan on getting one for our guest bedroom and another color for our master suite. Oh I will mention the \"gray\" appears to be more of a greige to my eyes, but with in on my gray bed it definitely looks gray. Regardless of the gray or greige, it's beautiful.",
