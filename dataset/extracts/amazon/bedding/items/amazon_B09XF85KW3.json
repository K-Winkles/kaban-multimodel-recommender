If you\u2019re considering it, then yes, it\u2019s worth it.Pros: colors are vibrant, lovely, and unlike the average comforter prints. Once I unpacked it, it fluffed up well enough. Yes, the fabric is silky and slick. This keeps it from binding up with sheets or blankets and pilling. It\u2019s mid-weight, warm enough, and doesn\u2019t look cheap at all. The wrinkles were gone within a day, so I\u2019m not sure what the rest of you are about when it comes to it smoothing out. My dog also likes it because it feels cool to the touch.Cons: I bought a king for my queen bed based on reviews by people saying that it runs very small. To this I say: you were evidently putting it on the bed sideways, because the king is far too big. The queen would have been fine placed on the bed correctly. The shams are gigantic, but again it\u2019s because I bought the king instead of the queen.If you\u2019re on the fence, buy it. It\u2019s very worth it.",
