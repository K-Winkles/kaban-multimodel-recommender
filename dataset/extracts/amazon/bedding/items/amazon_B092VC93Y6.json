There are multiple reviews on there that says it's a heavy comforter & that is absolutely not true. I took their word for it & was sorely disappointed. Luckily, I have a coverlet that I can use underneath it for additional warmth in the winter, otherwise I would be freezing. I like that it's buttery soft, comes with 2 pillow cases and the price couldn't be beat! Mine came compressed, did not have a weird smell & fluffed out within a few hours. I recommend running the steamer over it to get the wrinkles out. I bought a King for my Queen sized bed & it fits perfectly! The pillow cases on the King are for King sized pillows, so keep that in mind when ordering. Overall, it's a great set at a low price if you are in the market for a lightweight comforter. Would skip if you need a heavy comforter & live in a colder climate as this is not it.",
