We are supposed to have below zero temps coming and wanted to make sure she had a snuggly, warm, cozy blanket to keep warm. This is as perfect! Both sides are so soft, and the fact it has a layer in between helps make it extra warm. It is fairly lightweight but very warm due to that middle layer. No cold air coming through this blanket! Plus you get two pillow shams! You just can\u2019t beat what you get for the price. It\u2019s so warm and soft you won\u2019t be disappointed. In fact, my cat who always sleeps with me has now defected (the little traitor) and is curled up on her bed all the time, even he approves! Can\u2019t wait to get mine to curl up in (and have my cat back with me lol).",

                "reviewText": "This quilt is very comfortable very soft on both sides,, not just the look of the plant makes you fall in love not just by the touch but the quality of the amazing softness the design and the quality well made. Absolutely beautiful on my bed feels wonderful to the body and relaxing the money well spent especially getting a good night sleep is very refreshing in the morning. And the only reason why I give it 4 stars it's because I want to see how the dunk it holds up to the Quality after its first wash. But until then I will update you and have the quotes stands up to it's quality. PS my husband fell in love with this immediately and I say that is a plus for me cuz I haven't seen him sleep this comfortably in a long time includes myself. So I do recommend the purchase I guarantee you wouldn't be disappointed. And shopping with Amazon you can't go wrong because you can return if you don't like it without no problems so you can't lose either way.... so don't miss out on beautiful and comfort and soft to the touch all year round quilt Russian good night sleep and this is the quote for you.",
