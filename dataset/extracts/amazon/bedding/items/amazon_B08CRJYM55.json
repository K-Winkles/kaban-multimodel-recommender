It's not the thickest comfortor so if you want a thick one look elsewhere, but it is the sofest and most comfortable bedding I've ever owned. And I love the color it doesn't pick up all that much hair either with the color and the smooth texture of the bedding. It's still very warm though for being a not so thick comforter. I would highly recommend this brand so far! We've only used it one night haha.",

I saw very positive reviews and I decided to try it, and I'm very glad I did! The grey color is very beautiful and the diamond design is great for (most) stitches. My comforter didn't get \"white fuzzies\" like most mentioned, but it is very big and fluffy. I can tell it wasn't cheaply made. The only reason I didn't give it five stars because one area of the stitches came undone. Not a big deal, just feels weird and it noticeable. Other than that I love it. Very cheap for bed sheets, pillow cases, and a nice comforter. 9/10 <3",

Would love if they had a blanket that was a little heavier to add at the foot of the bed for a backup blanket for guests or cozy days at home.",
