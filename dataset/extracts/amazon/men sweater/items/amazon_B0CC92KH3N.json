The colors are strong and they look great. If they offer more argyle color options involving green, yellow and pink, I will buy them all. They are well made and you can store them in the see through zip lock bag they come with. Because they feel so light you can wear them even when it is not freezing outside. I wore one when it was 40 degrees and one when it was 65 degrees. Perfect.",
