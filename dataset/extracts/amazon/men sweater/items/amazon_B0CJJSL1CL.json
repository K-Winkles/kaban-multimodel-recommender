                "reviewText": "Another of my 'will just get this to knock about in the garage in - and how bad can it possibly be...' orders. Where I immediately find out how bad it can possibly be. I tend to have my expectations in check when purchasing something that is 100% synthetic. I knew it'd probably look 'not great', and in all honesty it doesn't look that nice. It has that shimmery sheen to it that all synthetic fibres have. It's not fooling anybody that it might be wool. Is it warm? Very. And I wanted it for working outside, pottering in the garage, and so that's a big tick. It's very warm for something not particularly thick. There were no loose threads or wonky seams. Arms were the same length. Buttons didn't immediately fall off. And it fit, briefly. And then it just kept growing. Stretching. Becoming more and more comedically baggy. After about two hours of wearing it, it had turned into a tent. I could have fit both arms down one sleeve.This, somewhat unsurprisingly, is very much one from the 'you get what you pay for' files.",

I was so happy with this item, because sometimes the pictures look a lot better than what you get. I can truly say that this sweater is well worth it and actually looks and feels like it could be more expensive than what is costs. It fits well (not baggy or too tight) and is true to size.",
