                "reviewText": "I hate shopping for clothes and do it MAYBE once every five years. I wasn't expecting much here. I chose this brand because, unlike too many other sweaters out there, this is 100% cotton. So I can wash it however I want without thinking of the effects on synthetic fibers. I was very pleasantly surprised to feel how soft this cotton is. I don't use wool at all but remember how light it is. This cotton sweater has a wool-like feel because it's so airy and light while still trapping warm air close to the body. I'd bought THREE other sweaters at local stores first and returned all of them because they just didn't look \"nice\" enough for a business-casual environment. But this Amazon sweater pairs nicely with a button-down shirt and blazer. And it keeps the cold at bay.I don't know how well this washes or how durable it is. My hope is a 100% cotton sweater will last a long time with careful washing. If this doesn't live up to that hope, I'll change my review. But for now, I'm very happy with this sweater. Light but warm, comfortable, and tasteful enough to wear to the office.",

We ordered 2 different colors and both sweaters wash up beautifully. I turned them inside out and washed them on a delicate, cold water cycle. I dried them on a low heat in the dryer and they came out looking great. I've always had good luck with Amazon Essential clothing for both men and women and recommend their products.",
