I love the fit and the soft lining.Question for the company - Can you extend the line to some other colors? I wear a cardigan every day of the week during the winter (stay warm, meet dress code). I'd love to see a hunter green, purple or burgundy, and say a nice chocolate. I can't buy the white one - I'm such a klutz that I would spill on it in the first week.",

                "reviewText": "This is a really nice knitted full-zip sweater with a bomber jacket style design at the edges and openings. It's full polyester, but that doesn't compromise the comfort -- it's really soft. It's also stitched well, clean and tidy, and the material doesn't pill up or snag easily. The stag emblem stitched on the left chest is a really nice accent and the gold on my off-white colorway really pops. It fits well and doesn't box up around the waistline. I'm 6'0\" 200lbs and the large size fits me well.If I had one critique it'd be the pockets. They aren't stitched into the inner lining, so if you're wearing the jacket open/unzipped, then sometimes you'll see the inner pocket fabric stick out of the jacket. It's not the best look.Overall though, this is a good sweater for cooler weather. Looks good, fits well, feels great. Recommended.",

If you like to roll back the ribbed cuffs to expose a bit of your wrists, you can do that. (I usually do; makes it more convenient to check my wristwatch, which I do a lot.)Even though this is advertised as a men\u2019s sweater, the pull tab of the zipper is on the left side. That doesn\u2019t bother me\u2014I\u2019m all about warmth and functionality\u2014but if you\u2019re an extreme traditionalist, now you know.",
