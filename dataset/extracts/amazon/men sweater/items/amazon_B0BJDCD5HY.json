                "reviewText": "So I bought this sweatshirt (and matching joggers) because it was bright green and I wanted some new comfy sweats. Imagine my joy and surprise when I opened the bag and saw it's bright Grinch green! It was one of those moments where the heavens opened, and beams of light, doves, and choirs, you get it. It is so comfy and soft and great quality for the price. And serendipitously, it arrived during a severe cold snap, and I needed something warm and comfy.Flash forward a couple of days of me wearing it for a few hours after work, and there are little green fluff balls everywhere. It comes out of the washer molting. It comes out of the dryer, and there is green, fluffy snow all over the laundry room. I am now afraid of my Grinch sweats. I handled it cautiously so my room and clothes were not \"Grinched.\" Every time I took it off, it left little bits of fluff everywhere. The second time I washed it, I shook it out well, then washed it inside out, and now my life is fluff-free.It is a great sweatshirt, and it's just a fact that this type of material will shed a little after the first wash. Now that it's done shedding, it's a fantastic sweatshirt, and the fluff is the only reason for not being a five-star rating.",
