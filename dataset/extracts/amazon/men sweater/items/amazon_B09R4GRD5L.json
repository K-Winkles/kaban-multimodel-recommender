I bought a large and it actually fits me great! Good length in the body, good length in the arms, and it isn't super baggy in the body. I'd actually thing this sweater would be too big for someone a few inches shorter than me. Great sweater overall.",

I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived that it is heavy, thick, super warm and exactly everything you\u2019d want in a sweater!! The sweater does run large so if you usually wear an XL in garments like this, I\u2019d get a Large. I have sweaters similar to this one in carts on other sites that would\u2019ve cost me $100+.

While it is not a \"dressy\" sweater, it will fit the bill for wearing to football games, hockey matches, etc. Undoubtedly it will look terrific worn under a jacket. Actually, I really love this sweater.",

Tried the Large, an improvement but it still made me look like I'd been on a 6 month crash diet..Eventually the size Medium was a perfect fit..good quality, looks fantastic, got it while on offer ( start of July 2023) so great price. Very happy with this product, fingers crossed it washes okay.",
