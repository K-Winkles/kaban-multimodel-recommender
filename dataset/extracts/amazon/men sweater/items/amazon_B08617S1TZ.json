He told me that the sweater kept him nice and warm and he very much loved the softness I goy thr navy blue and the I think it \u201c Kelly green\u201d. And they look really nice on him. My husband stands 5\u201911\u2019 and about 220 pounds and I got him an X-Large and it looked good on him with room to spare. He had a tshirt and a dress long sleeve shirt under that sweater and he still had a little room to spare. I would highly recommend this sweater. Ur other half will be happy with ur purchase for him. U will be also happy and the price of the sweater is really good. Thank you to this company for a well made product for us consumers. It\u2019s nice to get something worth buying Hey one more thing. I washed it and it came out wonderful and I even dried in dryer and to my surprise it came out wonderful as well it didn\u2019t stretch or look crappy. It looked brand new. Go ahead and buy this sweater u and the person u give it to will be pleased. \ud83d\ude42",

                "reviewText": "I was highly doubtful when I got this sweater -- I don't really buy my clothes from Amazon. Honestly, what sold me was the 7-day try on feature that Amazon has, so I went ahead and ordered it. Generally, I'm a men's size small, sometimes wearing a medium (I'm 5'8\" and about 145-150 lbs), so I ordered a size small.I absolutely love the pattern! I think it's perfect for a cozy winter vibe, and it does look more expensive than the price. I will say, the small is a little large on me, but after one dry cycle on low heat, it shrunk to the perfect size. The sweater does stretch well and it feels comfortable, too. It's not super soft, but it's better than your average $30 sweater.",
