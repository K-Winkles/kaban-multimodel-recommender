                "reviewText": "Edit(they sent me a light grey zip up...)I'd still not this at meh. I bought a new washing machine as my old was was on the fritz so I figured it was time to replace, did a load of the six I ordered between my wife and I, still somewhat soft but it's not going to last. Overall they are cheap and after some sewing to repair some shoddy fabric work they seem strong. Had to send two back as I got one that was a zip up and completely different color, and another that had a longer arm. I mean wtf. I suppose the cokune I purchased gave me a higher chance at getting something off but to Amazon, go inspect where you've got the manufacturer in Vietnam and see how well the conditions and quality of work actually are. I'm seeing a lot of errors in the seams, had to use a stitch puller to fix the black one and repaired the grey. I grew up around seamstress so suppose that knowledge was useful (also great for diy stitches) but most people wouldn't see this. Sure it would have lasted a few months before a tear or the fabric just unraveled, but these def need to be made better to avoid these problems. Changing to 3*. Doesn't mean they are bad but so many problems with a set of hoodies. Still, after the repairs I spent 50 bucks and got six of them (with my cc credits) but even buying straight out ten of these you're set for a long time if you can sew, understand seams and it came to the same price of a Quicksilver hoodie. Plus different colors. I see a lot of reviews on how they LOVE IT but it's from people that just put it on. They are pretty nice and soft out of the package, they will degrade. Interior fabric ain't bad tho.Edit done-----Not bad, but cheap. Pilling from the first wash, washed exactly as directed and did not use much heat to dry. Pilling. The sleeve at the wrist tore at the seam. Shrunk quite a bit and isn't soft anymore.It's a cheap hoodie and I'll wear it happily, but I've needed to sew it already, needed to shave it which upon a second gentle wash it's like I never did anything to depill.Don't expect high quality. It is somewhat comfortable and was soft, but it's a hoodie and that's really all there is to it. If you're looking for something that will last this is not a great buy, if you're looking for something like a cheap hoodie then look no further.Amazon won't let me review the grey one I bought for myself, but I got my wife a Navy one. Soft like mine was. Not going to stay that way, and I don't expect it to take any kind of wear and tear long. But it's cheap.Don't go for prime since this is \"reserved\" for prime members. I don't plan on buyinf another one but we will see, sometimes even good quality items have bad makes. These are made in Vietnam, not familiar with products coming out of Nam, and don't know if it's like puther certain countries that make their convicts make clothing. I'll have to look that up now. The price is great but if you want that \"one\" hoodie, spend extra to buy a good brand and made properly. Something study, but for the value here perhaps I'll buy more to see if I just had a mishap, plus you can't ever have enough hoodies!Still, good for the cost! Seems a negative, so I'm sort of meh about it. Wanted to replace my old hoodie I've had for five years now that the wrists have started the fray, but the overall durability of that thing (target brand) was so much stronger. I'd have to look to see if either clothing is being made more cheap or if this is just flat cheap. None of my zip ups or quick silvers do this, target brand (whatever the name of that is) and even an old walmaet brand beats this out, and isn't much more expensive.EDITSo I had ordered another one for my wife (navy blue) and I really wanted to just switch my Heather grey for that navy. It was still sort while mine pilled and tore, had to see the sleeve collars, etc. So I decided, you know what, I never said a word about the price, just the quality. I wore my grey often and yes it's pilling (getting little knots, fabric falls out, will wear out quickly) but for SIX of them, you got the price of a high quality hoodie and you've got six different colors, maybe got a fee zip ups, multiple colors, whatever. That's a damn good deal and I commend Amazon for it.So I ordered myself a replacement grey, a black, a green, and a navy. PTSD problems but whatever, that's not a serious issue of how bad the PTSD I've seen has, no need to talk about my line of work for how I got it.I got all of them in the mail by a friendly gentleman, needed to use the restroom ( I live at my business) opened them up when I felt it was time to break, and got a black, green, and then I saw the dark grey was a ZIP UP and damn near white. I don't do anything that isn't dark, doesn't look good. So I tried the Navy k got for my wife. The right shoulder was a bit longer than the other and it left a pointed shoulder. The rest are all well built expect that collar sleeve but was stretching, though just with my fingers and opening them up. Can't believe it tore. So I sent them back. They shipped me two new ones that will be here in two days, will be sending me a different blue and hopefully the right grey and won't be all screwed up. They gave me six hours to return my others so while I'm working overtime and no pay, I have a UPS store too minutes away so barely made that ridiculous time frameSo out of six so far, I got one that isn't even the grey or a pull over (see other review's, this seems a complaint and needed to be addressed. NEVER say anything about azons shipping. Some have been bad but it's pretty damn good.I'd even bought a new washer and dryer ( it was flooding from the washer and needed replacement, this months been fubar) and will update when I get the right items and do a few washes. It took two prior to get it s helluva lot less soft and shrunk.--------++++---------+++++Too damn long didn't read:So risks. Poorly made. Wrong item.Often pills and makes small patches that aren't soft and you need to shave them to keep it soft after two washes, cold water, in soft quality liquid soap. It shrunk after being in a bit high temps for a very short time period, and cannot be washed in anything but cold. Bad stains say nope.It didn't shrink THAT bad but sits at the waist, don't raise your arms lol)Is still comfortable but cheap, seams come apart, not badly but needs sewingCHEAP, great value and actually GOOD but you may need to send it back or wash it carefullyOverall C+Just get the right stuff to you and take care on washing it. It took two washes and some slight heat to make it much, much less soft and shrunk. I'll be updating this later for various reasons. I've noticed people buying the grey Heather are getting the light grey zip up. We didn't order that. I know no one wants it. Go home Amazon, you're drunk.",
