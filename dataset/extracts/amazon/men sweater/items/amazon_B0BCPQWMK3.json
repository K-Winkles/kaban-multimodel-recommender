No kidding, so far every single person that I know that has seen me wear it has said how great it looks and peppered me with questions on how much and where did I get it. I hope it lasts long enough so I don't have to come back to downgrade my review.",

                "reviewText": "A Beautiful sweate that feels silky and luxurious as well as sturdy and well-made. Arrived quickly and exceeded my expectations. The cowl neck with the buttons is a nice manly touch. The color navy is actually a cobalt blue that is luscious. I must return for a medium instead of small because the sleeves are a little short and it is somewhat fitted because of the elasticity. A young thin boy or man could wear it if it does stretch as much as is possible with the stretch in the material! A really expensive looking casual/dressy sweater.",

Wouldn't recomend for sleeping under the stars, but walking around town with a date or going to Christmas lights it's greatWhen I bought it though I was concerned about the collar, saw alot of reviews with it hooking high up on the neck or akward. I found the trick to making it look like the advertised photos is to fold the collar in 1/3 rds.Looks great, feels great, yeah if you snag it it could undo some stitching, but it's a sweater, it that's your biggest concern get a denim jacket or a plastic poncho. 100% recomend",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019m 6\u20195\u201d, 255, 50\u201d chest, 36-38\u201d waist, 37\u201d sleeve length. I usually wear an XL Tall, sometimes a 2X Tall.Looking at the size chart, I should probably wear a 3XL, but Amazon suggested that an XL would fit. Several reviews said the sleeves were long, and the sweater would stretch. They were right. The chart was wrong.I got an XL, and it stretches just enough to look good in the chest, and the arms are long enough with just a bit of slack. I wore it last weekend while traveling and got a couple compliments. It basically fit like it does in the first few pictures. The only thing that was a bit snug was the shawl collar, which I buttoned up, but had to adjust a couple of times to get it to not roll up. I wore it over a long sleeve wicking tee. It\u2019s polyester, but it felt like a cotton sweater. I got a fair amount of fuzz on the shirt, wearing it the first time, but it was soft and comfortable.If you are taller and have an athletic or weightlifter\u2019s build, this may be a good option for you. The sleeves and body are longer, and you have to hand wash (or maybe machine wash gentle/delicate) the sweater anyway, so shrinkage shouldn\u2019t be an issue. If you\u2019re six foot or shorter, you\u2019ll probably have some extra length in the sleeves to push up. If you are less athletic, though, it has some stretch through the belly to hide a bit of extra weight.",
