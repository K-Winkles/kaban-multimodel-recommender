BIG plus- the cable weave is also along the back of the sweater- wow, you never see that anymore. Now the bad, it washes in cold water well and i dried it laying flat but it shrank lengthwise and now barely covers my jeans waist. Total gutted.",

It's probably a little too warm to wear in a hot room and the neck is quite high and thick. If you have a short neck you'll want to wear it rolled.",
