I have a million hoodies (I exaggerate) and if I have to put my coat on over a hoodie, it is cumbersome. This sweatshirt is perfect for going on under a heavy coat, windbreaker or raincoat without bunching up at my neck. If my neck is cold, I can zip it all the way up and my chin and neck stay warm.",

I went with the size recommended by Amazon and the overall length and sleeve length are fine, but it is a little tight around the chest when zipped (and I am not particularly large), so factor that into your consideration. It's perfect for wearing around the house on chilly days.",
