                "reviewText": "Absolutely love this sweatshirt! Perfect for chores around the house, lounging, or sleep. This gets more use than my \u201cnicer\u201d, softer Patagonia fleece, bc it stands up so well to machine washing, so I don\u2019t feel bad if I wear it while cleaning or working outdoors.Lightweight but really warm. Super comfy. I wear a women\u2019s S, and would\u2019ve ordered XS in this item if it was available (since the sizing here is unisex or men\u2019s, ie one size up). The S is a little big on me, especially in the shoulders.The wine color is gorgeous irl, it\u2019s a heathered mix of rust and navy that makes it look a lot more expensive than it is. Zipper is good quality and doesn\u2019t rub on my neck. Overall, for $15, a great purchase. I will probably get another!",

                "reviewText": "The design of this product is pretty average. Nothing extra stylish but nothing overly frumpy either. Overall the material is fine for the price and no real complaints there. The only issue I have with these is that they are kind of short on your torso.If you are to bend over to pick something up, or sit down in a chair you are more than likely to have these sweatshirts run up your back quite a bit. They probably could have been cut an extra couple inches longer so you will find yourself pulling them down to maximize the stretch regularly.",

I was slightly concerned that the small was going to be too big but I was pleasantly surprised! It fits perfect and looks fantastic. Great quality, soft, arrived quickly. Highly recommend!Edit: had to reduce 1 star because this sweater is a lint magnet. I still love it, but it\u2019s become higher maintenance than I generally like",
