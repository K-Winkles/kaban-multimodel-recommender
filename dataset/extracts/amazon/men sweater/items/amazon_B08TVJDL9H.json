Bought this for my husband the color was as pictured, length was surprisingly well he has a very long torso usually hard to find shirts long enough. But then the armpits connected oddly low compared to a normal shirt and the sleeves were never ending. Pushed up over his hand he had an awkward amount of material built up. And the shoulders looked like puff sleeves from the 90s. So three stars it is. Wouldn\u2019t recommend",
