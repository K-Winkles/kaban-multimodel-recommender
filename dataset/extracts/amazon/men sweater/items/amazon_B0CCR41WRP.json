                "reviewText": "This is the same sleeve the color looks different with the flash a bit but it washed out the part I was trying to show.So good news is that it's comfy and really pretty warm even though it's quite thin. If you're not careful you'll put your finger thru it. But this should be expected maybe for under $40.Ita a bit tighter than I expected for a (L) but it's loosened up some over this first week of wear.Unfortunately the quality is a bit suspect because if you see the piling and frayed edges already, after just a week of wearing, I'm curious at best about how much I'll be shaving the sweater and how long it'll last. Again trying to take the under $40 into account.All in all I bought 3 sweaters this day all the same size (L) which is my \"normal\" size and best guess from one of the size charts shown. Only this one is close to a good fit and a definite keeper. So this is another positive for me at this point.I like the style but would prefer a different packaging. The sweater arrives buttoned and the holes pretty well stretched out. Additionally the creases from its initial folding are holding fast so far. I'll have to wash it sooner than I hoped or wanted for all these reasons.",
