I am female, 5'3\" tall, 130 lbs and this fit in my usual men's size medium. The cut is nicely \"relaxed,\" comfortable, without being too big. It sits comfortably at my hips and works well over a flannel shirt or t-shirt. It isn't a heavy \"beefy\" sweatshirt, but it isn't thin either. Just your standard weight. The 60% cotton content fabric breathes as you expect cotton to do. I have dried this in a dryer on medium with no noticeable shrinkage. The color selection is nice. Happy with my purchase.",

                "reviewText": "This is the second Fruit of the Loom sweatshirt I\u2019ve ordered. I ordered an orange for Halloween & was so impressed with the quality I decided to order a red for Christmas. I wear these when I\u2019m at home & for running errands. I\u2019m a female 5\u20196\u201d, 180lbs & ordered the large. I like the length as it covers my bum. The sweatshirt is extremely soft. It is lightweight which I like as I don\u2019t like the heaviness of hoodies. I usually wear a short sleeved shirt underneath. This keeps me warm. It\u2019s nicely made with no loose threads. Mine wasn\u2019t tag-free as there was a tag I cut off on the bottom left side. This launders well in cold water. With it being 60% cotton I don\u2019t dry it. I hang dry it. It does come out of the washer with some wrinkles but in the drying process these do completely go away. One thing to be aware of is the hole to get it over your head is a little small. It does stretch the material a little bit in that area since it\u2019s 40% polyester. For the quality this is well worth the price. I do recommend & would definitely look at buying more colors in the future.",

They are very soft and the perfect indoor weight for lounging or when you just need to put something a little warmer on. You don't feel \"weighed down\" with this sweatshirt on. It's almost like you don't feel you have it on. That's not to say that it's paper thin. Yes, it's lighter weight than some other more expensive sweatshirts but enough to keep you warm. Some sweatshirt materials are not very \"flexible\" but this one it. It moves along with you easily. While this is a size or two larger than I need it doesn't look overly sloppy or have an overly huge neck opening. I bought a Walmart brand sweatshirt that was similarly as big and it just looked out of proportion and too sloppy. Price is right on this one too.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this sweater because I was looking for sweaters I could wear in the winter that didn't have a hood. I bought this in several different colours. The fit was great (size up if you like it baggy), and I believe they are unisex since it's a man advertised in the picture but it fits me just as well. This one came really quick and was as described, pretty warm and very soft on the inside. I have noticed that after several washes and wears, it has thinned a bit and the inside is not as soft. Will that deter from wearing it? No. One thing to note also is that in the beginning when washing (even in cold water) the colour did bleed. I made the mistake of putting white pillow cases in with it and now they're pink lol. Otherwise, the sweater is very comfortable, fits me very well, and honestly it's such a convenient and simple staple piece. I have 5 of them in my closet lol.Pro's:- unisex- comfortable- warmCon's:- bleeds in first few washes- loses some softness on inside over time",
