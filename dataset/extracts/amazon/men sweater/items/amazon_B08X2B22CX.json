                "reviewText": "Clothing shopping online can be so hit or miss, as different makers seem to size so drastically different. (Where are the size charts?)This Amazon Basic quarter zip 'sweatshirt' is a nice looking style and is a quality sewn pullover for wearing over a dress shirt for casual work situations if one is needing a bit of warmth but without too thick of layers.Yes it is fleece on the inside, but is more of a nice light- midweight fabric. ( Nothing like a Carhartt -type of fleece in thickness or the traditional college 'sweatshirt' heavy fabric)The outside of the fleece is more dressy and smooth than a 'sweatshirt' is... casual work setting appropriate.The size ( was a guess) was spot on in fit. (Laying the size XL garment flat, 25\" across the front from under the arm seam to opposite side... it tapers down to about 23.5\" at the bottom band...25.75\" from top of arm to sleeve bottom.) Not too bulky, and not form-fitting like a knit fabric would be, either.The fit is for a 'normal' guy's body (Not the fitted/ athletic /slim kind of 'second skin' that shows every extra helping of food one has eaten) ... hubby is over 60, about 190 pounds and it fits him great.Washes up and dries wonderfully so far, staying true to size. (Wash turned inside out to protect the 1/4 zipper)I would recommend and would purchase again if more colors were available in the size needed.",

I wear it several times per week. No pocket in front or sides but for the money it's fine. I bought Amazone sweatpants a while back, and they are the same - decent weight and soft and have worn well.",

Since it's made of a cotton blend, I sent it back to exchange for a large, which fits well and allows for shrinkage. I think these run a little small, something to consider. It's not a heavy fleece, but good for cool weather. Looks good with a T shirt.",
