                "reviewText": "Merino wool. The wool that made you a liar when you said \u201cI can\u2019t wear wool because it makes me itch\u201d. Merino wool became the wool any person could wear next to their skin as it felt like spun cotton. But, hey, Merino wool is still wool meaning dry clean. Not so fast. Merino wool socks have proven that by weaving synthetic fibers with 50% and more Merino, a happy, and completely washable textile fiber is possible. That\u2019s a lot of words to let you know this sweater is a blend featuring Merino wool. Results are better than expected as it should be when a sweater is much more on display than socks.This sweater has the finish, and even feel, of cashmere. Dress it up or down as it can handle all but the most formal situations, but feel very comfortable in casual wear. This is the first textile item I\u2019ve ever owned that states: Made in Jordan. Well, move over Peru for authentic luxury knits as this one looks and feels great at a most reasonable cost. For fit\u2026I\u2019ve gotten used to ordering above my size due to the decade of clingy and skinny fit influences. Well, this one is a traditional fit so go back to true sizing before it got hijacked by the coolest generation (LOL!) who have no clue how to dress. Notice I\u2019m not saying what generation as it was an amalgamation of all from the eighties onward. Anyway, get your true size or go down if you have had to compensate so long you\u2019re confused. And put on a nice shirt, pull this over, match with either NEW jeans of khnakis and viola. you have affordable class Washes fine in cold. Dries on cool without puckering. If it lasts a while without pills or unseen shortcomings it will be a huge bargain.",

The fabric of this sweater is soft and not itchy- I am quite sensitive to itchy wool (even merino wool and even with an undershirt) and this one has no problems. The color is pretty much spot on with the pictures. The fit is good\u2026 I am 5\u201910\u201d and 155lb and I ordered a medium. It is just a HAIR loose but nothing bad at all\u2026 I\u2019d rather err on the side of being a little loose rather than too tight.I wore it during a mild fall day so I can\u2019t really comment on how warm it is. But I was neither hot nor cold and it was between 60 and 70.Overall, a nice sweater.",

The gunmetal heather color looks sharp and pairs with anything. Well made with reinforced seams. Great layering piece for cooler weather.",
