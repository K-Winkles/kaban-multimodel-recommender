Also, hubby has very long arms (as a former basketball player, he calls it wingspan) but this sweater goes all the way down to his wrists.Personally, I\u2019m not a fan of pullover sweaters, though the zip makes it look very stylish.",

It may be a little tighter fit than expected so I won't be able to wear a collared shirt underneath but I'm ok with that. Looks stylish nonetheless. I guess fit depends on your body style. I'm fairly athletic build with a broader chest. But I am not sure if going Large is best suited for a Medium user. The material is soft and the stitching seems to be very good. I'd definitely buy this again.",

There is a subtle but noticeable discoloration on the item where a few spots on the chest and shoulder areas have white that comes through and contrasts the olive color of the item. It is so subtle that I had someone else check to make sure my eyes weren\u2019t deceiving me and they agreed that both items had the discoloration. The fit was great and the material seems nice and warm but I couldn\u2019t unsee that discoloration.",
