Holds its shape nicely for about 5-6 wearings before it starts to stretch out\u2014particularly the turtleneck. I totally ignored the washing instructions and machine-washed (front-loader) all three sweaters with other items in cold water, regular HE liquid detergent, rapid-spin dry, then dried them in the dryer on delicate, lowest temperature setting for 30 minutes. They came out 98% dry and perfectly re-shaped with no shrinkage.The sweater is supple and soft, and warm and comfortable to about 60\u00b0F, after which it's a little warm (for me.) I cannot think of any reason to not purchase one: great fit, great look, great comfort, great price.",

It has a fairly loose open weave and is predominantly cotton, so it\u2019s quite breathable and well suited for layering in cool but not truly cold weather. The knit is a little coarse, not really scratchy but not very soft. It\u2019s a good value for what they charge. And fine for casual wear. But I ultimately decided to return it and spend a lot more to get a merino wool sweater because they are dressier, much warmer for weight, MUCH softer, and less bulky under a jacket. I like to wear mock turtlenecks under a sport coat in the fall and this sweater was a little too thick for that.",
