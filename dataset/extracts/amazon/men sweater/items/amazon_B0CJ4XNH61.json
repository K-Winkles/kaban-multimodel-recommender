                "reviewText": "The product matches perfectly to the product photos and description.The fabric is of very nice quality. It is not too thick but has a great weight to it to keep you warm in colder weather. It feels on the softer side of sweater material but still has a cable knit feel to it. My husband loves wearing it. Some cable knit sweaters can feel itchy, but this one is definitely very soft and comfortable to wear. No itchy feeling even after a few washes.The fit is great too! My husband usually wears an XL in shirts/sweaters so I decided to order XL. It has a nice loose fit to it that's comfortable and doesn't hug his body too much. If you want it to be a little more snug or form-fitting, you could even size down 1 size. It's perfect for work or any dinner out! It's very versatile and perfect for the cold weather season!",

                "reviewText": "The reason I am only giving this three stars is because it had a funky, musty smell when it arrived and it took 3 washes with scented detergent to get rid of the weird smell. It's almost as if this was sitting in a humid shipping container for a long time. For this reason I'm not sure this would be a good gift for someone. You would definitely want to wash this before wearing it.Now that the smell is gone, I am satisfied with it. The fabric is a decent weight and the quality is good. This would be well suited for a cooler environment as it's a mid-heavy weight. The material is in the middle range of softness - not super soft but not stiff or scratchy either. If you are someone with dry or sensitive skin, this might not be the the best choice for you.The styling is nice and a sweater like this can be dressed up or down depending on where you are going.I am 5'11 and about 210 lbs and I ordered an XL. The sweater fits as I expected.",

                "reviewText": "I'm usually between sizes (L and XL) for sweaters. I decided to go with a Large and that was the right call - the fit is perfect. The shirt isn't too clingy and it is long enough for my unusually long torso. It's a nice feel - I wouldn't say it's the softest material, but I always wear an under shirt, and usually roll up my sleeves so that isn't too much of an issue. Overall, if you like the style of the shirt - this is a great, affordable option!",

Of course I had to immediately wash it twice before he could wear it but once I did, everything was all good from there. It held its shape and color as if it were new right out of packaging. Washed it on delicate (twice, soaked & washed it in cold, fabric softener added each time on rinse cycle) then laid it flat to air dry. The quality is substantial enough that I'm certain this will be part of his sweater collection for many year's to come.",

It is machine washable on a cold setting and according to the instructions it should be turned inside out first. It can be tumble dried on low.I normally take a \"large\" in garments like this and that is what I ordered, and it fitted exactly as expected. It weighs about 1.5lbs which is not super heavy but heavy enough!Overall, I am very impressed with this sweater. It looks good, it's comfortable to wear, and it's warm. If you are looking for a comfortable sweater for the upcoming cold weather then I recommend you consider this one.",

This is a boxy, regular fit sweater - I was hoping for a slimmer chest, and almost chose a medium because the chest seemed much larger than what I normally wear, but I needed the arm length of a large (6'0\", 170lbs). I chose the large - as advertised, the chest was too big and the arms were just right (a medium would not have the arm length). I'm not able to wear this, but their advertisement was exactly right so they still get five stars (again, it's otherwise very nice!).If you prefer regular-fit sweaters, refer to the size chart and you'll be very happy.",
