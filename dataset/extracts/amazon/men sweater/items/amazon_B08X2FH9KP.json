                "reviewText": "I'm satisfied with the hoodie. I also bought a zip up Fleece Vest in the same exact:\"Buffalo Plaid\" pattern (aka checkerboard, or Americanized Scottish) and they both fit perfectly and are durable, and comfortable and easy to clean and keeps me warm. I would but again, definitely, if I had too, but I trust it'll last a long time. They actually did a great job on the quality of craftsmanship with the Amazon Essentials hoodie and vest. I'd buy a matching hat and pants to go with these in Amazon Essentials brand, as well, if it's available. It's a popular pattern, especially in December and January, but, at least I know \"Buffalo Plaid\" is more of a Scottish thing, than people realize. Which is appropriate, as that runs in the family. I just see everyone wearing it these days and shake my head about it. But pattern aside, the importance of this review, is to justify that Amazon Essentials is excellent high quality craftsmanship in their personal brand of clothing line. I ONLY give credit like this if it's earned and worth mentioning. And they make great winter weather clothes, apparently, as I'm a satisfied customer with purchases like the hoodie and vest.",

                "reviewText": "This is really a beautiful jacket but it didn't work for me as a woman. I wanted a regular, not oversized fit, so I bought a Small. I would normally buy a Medium in women's tops and bottoms. It's snug around the hips (I am not particularly hippy and don't have much of a belly). I can zip it and it looks fine but it feels tight. The sleeves are too long for me so there are a lot of folds/bumps. If I sized up for the hips , the rest of the jacket and especially the sleeves would be too big. So I am returning it. I also was looking for a lightweight sweatshirt jacket. This one I would call medium weight - not really thick and bulky like some, but it does have some cush to it. It's really soft and snuggly and if it fit me better, I'd keep it even though it's a little heavier than I wanted.",

I wrote a review about the sweatpants my feeling is they are bit Off the size and fit just feel a lil weird but I kept them. Now the Sweatshirts... I bought 7 and they shipped in 3 separate shipments on 3 consecutive days... 2 then 4 then 1- Very wasteful. Job security for the delivery people I guess. lol. So I try on the first 2 that arrived. They were very snug I immediately packed them back up for return. I wear Hanes XL all winter fits very good comfortable fit I have an XXL Hanes that is big on me for when I wear heavy sweatshirts under it.So today I get the second shipment... set aside 2 XL for return. Try on The XXL and it was a better fit but still not near as comfortable as my Hanes. So now I inspected the actual garment and access the quality.... And the Zipper is plastic.... And the cuffs and waistband just are there. They don't taper or cinch properly. So the air can flow up around the waist. The wrists just float they don't fit to your wrist... I only bought the Amazon Essentials because sale price was 1/3 of original... Why not give it a try. I hate returning stuff. I was very disappointed horrible fit and quality is disappointing. The actual material is pretty light weight but seems ok. I just noticed though on the Amazon ones you can see the stitching on the outside... on the should wrists waist arms. Pockets I get you can't avoid it but my Hanes stitching is seen on the inside.You can buy if it is cheap on sale. I am keeping the XXL sweatshirts(really XL) but be aware you won't be 100% on the fit. I was like eehhhh for $8 I will try. I bought these hoping to regularly wear the XL around the house and the XXL over other warm clothing out in the cold weather. Now I will probably just wear the XXLs on occasion but not every day all day like my Hanes. The XLs are going back.Just an honest review. And disappointment .Now I have to stop by a Kohls for the easiest way for me to return because they give like 6 weeks to do it and do drive by a Kohls when I go to Walmart every couple weeks.",

The material is thick, the cuffs are ribbed. The arm length is great, leaning towards the longer side. My favorite feature is the lined hoodie portion. It has a super soft jersey in the hood. This keeps your hair from getting static in it from the fleece. The whole jacket has a great length to it, its not short. and the band around the bottom is ribbed like the cuffs. The zipper is a heavy duty zipper that doesn't snag or catch. We have about 6 of these hoodie's. Great Hoodie for the money.",
