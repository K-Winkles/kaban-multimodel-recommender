My back is bigger than most peoples so clothes just don\u2019t fit me will because of that. This sweater complements that, and it makes me look amazing when I\u2019m going casual wear. All the stitching is perfect very strong. On a sidenote, I always seem to rip my clothes at the seams, but with this, that\u2019s definitely not gonna happen because the stitching is very good. Overall, this is a very nice and well made sweater",

That being said, the material is a bit thin for what I like in a cardigan - it seems like more of a vest material. Also, the cut of it, as can be seen in the picture, is a bit closed, again somewhat vest-like. Perhaps I am old and looking for older cuts.I ordered the XL and have a 46in chest. It is snug in the chest, more so than I would prefer unless I weren't wearing anything underneath it, which would be weird. A bit snug in the shoulders, too. Perhaps this is in the 'tight fit' fashion paradigm. In any case, I didn't love it, but it's not garbage either.",

This is the sweater that you can wear on a first date or social function with black pants and either a plain white t-shirt underneath, or a nicer button down. The cardigan gives you that versatility.This is the sweater that you'll drape over her when she says \"it's kind of chilly in here\" and you'll look like a total gentleman and you'll definitely get smooches.This is the sweater that she will inevitably take because she likes how she looks in it too, which is why you NEED TO BUY MORE THAN ONE. This is unavoidable, women will always take our sweaters, so we need to be prepared, because a black cardigan is what you can wear to work or school, or parties or whatever and still look like a total hunk.You got tattoos? Lucky you. Push up the sleeves and show them off with the same black pants/simple top ensemble and you look like a distinguished bad a**.Trust me guys, this is THE cardigan. You need to have this in your closet. You can thank me later.",

                "reviewText": "This Docker cardigan sweater is a thin, light, 60% cotton sweater. But, I am not certain calling this \"regular fit\" is on target. I did read a previous review regarding sizing and did order an XXL while I usually would order an XL. The sleeve length is right on the mark but it is a little tight through the arms and shoulder. Also , when I button the sweater, it is tight across my chest. I will probably continue to wear it a few times but the fit is not as roomy as I prefer. I had my wife try it on and it looks much better on her than me although she is 7\" shorter than I am. Have not washed yet but if it does shrink as described by another review then no way I could wear and my wife will have a new sweater. Granted, I am not a slender person and if I was, this would probably be ideal and very comfortable.",

                "reviewText": "I got this sweater for my husband, who generally wears a size L or XL shirt. This Dockers \u201cregular fit\u201d cardigan sweater is definitely a smaller cut than he is used to wearing. I ordered a size XL, and out of the package, the sleeves barely came down to his wrist bone and the overall fit seemed somewhat small. At a 60% cotton / 40% polyester mix, I was worried about even the smallest amount of shrinkage.I gave it a wash and dry on gentle in cold water, and then tumble dry low. It did shrink a bit, and the sleeves pull up when he stretches out his arm. Also, the circumference around the waist is a bit tighter now. In my opinion, the XL barely fits him.As for length, it comes down just below his belly button and barely covers the waist band of his jeans. It's okay when he's just standing or sitting, but the moment he has to reach or stretch, the waist is definitely pulling up.There is no shortage of tags on this sweater. From three sewn into the neckline to multiple on the inner seam. You do receive an extra button sewn into the care tag, which is nice.As for pricing, the tag shows an MSRP of $65.00. While this is a nice, quality mid-weight sweater, I think the price is definitely indicative of the Dockers name brand. My feeling is that the price point is too high, even in today\u2019s world. I recommend this sweater if you can get a deal on it, and you should consider ordering one size up.",
