I would have ordered more but they only had one color available in my size. But I keep checking back.",

I got him an XL which is very typical and usually fits him perfect/big and this was snug which is ok but it's not long enough. The material should be about 3 inches longer. The material is a little scratchy and reminds me of the wool Army issued blankets we got at basic training. We kind of liked that about it only because we were both in the Army and for some reason that itchy wool is nostalgic but for normal people it would probably be too scratchy. I'm also afraid it might shrink when I wash it.",
