The only thing it is not is \"lightweight.\" I am keeping it because it is a great sweater, but I originally wanted it to replace a thin cotton sweater that was truly lightweight and good for late spring/summer/early fall. This one is a tad to heavy for warm weather. That said, it will be my staple for mid-fall/winter/early spring.",

                "reviewText": "Nice sweater and can't complain about the price, but the thing is like 1 1/2 sizes too big. Like, even if this were the 90's still (before everything became slim fit this or that), this still would be too large.Even worse, it doesn't look like it would shrink due to the materials, so I got to find some linebackers or something to fit the XXL I bought.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very soft sweater and very warm - almost like a cashmere. The material feels substantial and thick, but it isn\u2019t actually all that heavy. The fabric is very stretchy, however, and I feel like I might over-stretch it while taking it off. Did not shrink in the wash. It gets a little fuzzy over time, but a $10 lint shaver will solve that if you don\u2019t like it. The fit is a bit on the larger side, but allows for room to wear collared shirts underneath comfortably.",
