                "reviewText": "Joey Here! This is one great sweater. It is soft and warm. The cable pattern really sets off the look. I have 10 zip up polo type sweaters that cost five times more than this one. However this sweater has them all beat in looks and comfort as well as in price. I normally wear a medium shirt. I prefer my sweaters of this type to be on the roomy side, so I ordered the large size. I am wearing it as I write this review. As I wear the larger size the sleeves are a little long. This turned out to be a good thing. I rolled the sleeves inside the arms. This creates a really nice look on this garment as seen in the photo above as the cable knit shows well at the wrist. I really am fond of the zipped all the way up turtle neck look. This will provide nice warmth around the neck on cold days. This garment in one wearing has become my absolute favorite zip up pullover sweater.",

I usually wear an XL and she ordered that size the body fits nicely but the sleeves are a little long. I would have ordered a size large and the knit gives a little as you wear it. I've washed it twice since receiving it and comes out as new after machine in cold and air dry flat so it doesn't lose it's shape. Great gift.",

                "reviewText": "I was running a bit low on cold-weather clothing and the outside temps dropped pretty low in my area over the past couple months. This turtleneck really came in handy for keeping me warm both while making short trips outside to run errands and while simply kicking back when at home (tried not to run the heater when it could be avoided to keep my energy bill low). I genuinely really like everything about the design of this turtleneck -- 10 stars in that regard, in my opinion.HOWEVER, I do have to point out that the sizes run quite large. I ordered this in my normal size (XL) but it fits like a 2XL, so I kind of swim in it. If someone is interested in this turtleneck, I'd recommend ordering one size smaller than what you normally would.",

I tried this on before washing and did not see any difference after washing and drying along with all my normal laundry. I ordered the size that I would normally wear and I believe that this would be considered to run slightly above normal fit, which is what you would want if you are layering other clothes underneath. Overall, this sweater looks and feels great. I love that it has a unique look I would absolutely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This is a super stylish, with Quarter Zip (I think), \u201cTurtleneck ish\u201d Neckline with banded cuffs, neck and hem. The zipper is made of metal and has a silver tone pull. It did hesitate a couple inches from the bottom when unzipping but with the tiniest bit of attention it unzipped completely and zipped back up with no further issue. It is 100% Polyester and is described in the online description as 3D Knitted Fabric. This fabric has a good amount of Stretch and I think will be comfortable to the wearer. I wouldn\u2019t consider it a Heavy Sweater, as it\u2019s a thinner material than the thick, chunky, knitted garments that may come to mind when you think \u201csweater\u201d. The weave of this Polyester material is basketlike with an over/under pattern. It appears to be true to size as well. I got this as a gift and after the recipient wears it a couple times I will update this Review if anything is different or has changed.",
