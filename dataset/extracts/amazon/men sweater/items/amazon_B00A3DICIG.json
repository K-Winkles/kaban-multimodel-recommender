It\u2019s big in width and length however I don\u2019t mind it being loose. Never owned a woolly jumper before and I imaged it would be itchy however it\u2019s the total opposite! It\u2019s soft on the skin, warm and you can tell it\u2019s made from quality materials. Even though I\u2019ve only just bought it I can safely say it\u2019s my favourite jumper already.",
