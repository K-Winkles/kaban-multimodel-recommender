I got the small, and it is perfect! Only \u201cslightly oversized\u201d, so if you\u2019re looking for true OVERsized, consider sizing up 1 or 2 sizes for look you\u2019re wanting. I am 5\u20197\u201d, about 120, 32-34A. Sleeves are the right length, covers bum. Beautiful blue color (01-blue) which is perhaps a little lighter than the ad, but my camera also washed out the color. First pic is truer to the blue color but still lighter looking due to my camera. I have already bought this sweater in 3 other colors. THIS is what I want in the cold winter. Great for the office and super cute with jeans and boots. I LOVE LLBean sweaters for the winter due to their thickness and warmth. This is half the price and has the same feel. Amazing. Buy one!",

                "reviewText": "LOVE this and have so much to say.First, a note about sizing because I saw a bunch of people asking. I'm 5'4\" and around 110 lbs, and the XS was spot-on for that perfect oversized look. Big enough to be able to wear leggings without completely drowning me in fabric (e.g. still looks like it fits).Now, onto the quality. This sweater feels heavy in exactly the right way. If I had tried it on in an in-person store, I would've easily guessed it cost $350. The texture feels handmade - and warm without being overpowering. I can easily see it becoming my fav winter sweater.The attention to detail is awesome. The stitching, the design - it looks like someone took their time crafting this.Hard to get something that looks exactly like the picture on Amazon, and this does that. Five stars all the way! \ud83c\udf1f",
