I have very broad shoulders and a bit of a belly. I work out daily so I have a mix of muscle and some belly fat. (For body description so you understand how the hoodie fits) The quality and construction of this hoodie is good. It\u2019s not heavyweight, but not tshirt thin either. The inside is very soft to the skin and is very comfortable in the arms. Now for the bad. The body is pretty short, it covers my belt, but there is no extra length. The waist band is bigger than the body of the hoodie so the waist fit\u2019s strange and it doesn\u2019t hug the body at all. The cut of the body is very, very boxy. This is certainly Not a flattering cut/look. For someone like my mom 5\u20195\u201d and thin who wants an oversized hoodie it\u2019s fine, but for someone who falls under \"big and tall\" who wants something that fits \"properly\" I\u2019d probably pass on this one.

                "reviewText": "Very soft and comfy jacket overall. I bought the medium and it is a bit big on me. (6ft 125lbs)This is not a heavy weight jacket at all though. If you hold it I'm front of a light you can see the light through it.So if your looking for a thick/heavy jacket I wouldn't really recommend it.But if your looking for a lighter softer jacket to use as a layer this is perfect.",
