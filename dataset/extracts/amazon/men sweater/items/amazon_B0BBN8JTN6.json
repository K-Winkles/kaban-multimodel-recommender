                "reviewText": "I\u2019m very happy to have found this Jersey from Buffalo David Bitton for a number of reasons.It is not blousy. My skinny bod has a tendency to make shirts look like tents. Not this one.The sleeves are long. Very long in a way that says this jersey is very casual. I find myself folding the sleeves back about three inches to get them to hang correctly on my 35\u201d sleeves. The knitted jersey fabric is 95% cotton and 5% polyester which provides enough stretch to comfortably roll up the sleeves. The give in the cloth also allows it to easily follow your moves.The dual colors and pleasurable fit make this a top to wear almost anywhere. Makes it interesting, too. The colors are accurately displayed in the product description pictures.The fabric is pleasingly soft and comfortable.It was easy to remove the logo from the pocket. Sorry, Mr. Bitton. The pocket is somewhat undersized to be useful. It is more of a decoration with a stylized V woven into it for a nice touch.It is OK for machine washing and drying and will stand up to an iron if necessary. The jersey came out of a gentle wash and dry with all of the packing wrinkles gone and no need for an iron.I\u2019m slim at 5\u201911 and 155 pounds with 35 inch sleeves and this great garment top could not suit me any better.Oh, and the main body is one of my favorite colors for a shirt!",

The 95/5% cotton/polyester fabric is fairly thin but very soft and a little warmer than I initially thought it might be. A great, casual option for a cozy day at home.I ordered my usual size Large, and the shirt fits as expected in width but quite long in the sleeves and torso. It\u2019s perhaps ideal for taller people but somewhat resembles oversize sleepwear on my 5\u20199\" frame. Sewing quality is good, with no significant defects on the shirt I received.Overall, a supremely comfy shirt with a simple, relaxed style. Perfect for those with a tall build, but still very wearable for everyone else.",
