I have a longer torso than most people at my height, and the hem still sits well below my hip. This is fine if you really want to have your bottom mostly covered, but I think the ideal jacket hem ought to sit between your waistline and top of your hip if you want a flattering fit for men.It's also worth mentioning the x-small size had a looser and floppier collar than the small. I imagined that the x-small would have a tighter collar than the small, but I assume this is a quality control issue.Pros are the material feels nice and soft. The material is thin so it has limited function beyond spring/ summer weather.",
