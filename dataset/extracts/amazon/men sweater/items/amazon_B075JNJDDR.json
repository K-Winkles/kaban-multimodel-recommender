                "reviewText": "My husband usually buys his sweatshirts, size 4XLT, from a well known big and tall company. They run around $40. So when I saw these on Amazon, I bought 1 in 4XL Tall, to see how they fit him. These came to less than 1/2 the prize of his regular shirts. The shirt fitted well, but it was way too long for him, by about 4 inches. I kept it, but ordered another one sized 4 XL. This one fits him like the Tall size that he gets from the well known big and tall seller. So I ordered three more. I would say that the tall are really too long, and the regular length is about 3 inches longer than normal.These shirt are well made. The fabric is thick and of good quality. The seams are perfect. They fit him really well. I washed them in warm water and dried them on low. The colors (black and navy) did not run and the shirts did not shrink. They came out very soft. At less than 1/2 the price of what he normally buys, these are a terrific value.",

                "reviewText": "Update: This shirt came out of the dryer with no wrinkles or shrinkage. It\u2019s just out of the mail, in the photos.I thought I would give the Pink a try, because it\u2019s hard to find a warm sweatshirt for under $30, these days. It\u2019s 5\u20197\u201d, 210 lbs., and got a 2X. I usually wear a Women\u2019s 2X, but usually size up to Women\u2019s 3X in sweatshirts. I\u2019m so glad I chose this size, because it\u2019s just big and long enough to cover me to mid-hip. It\u2019s not for leggings\u2026just a regular sized, boxy, thick, warm sweatshirt. The problem is the sleeves are way too long and the wrists are huge. The sleeves don\u2019t stay pushed up, and hang down to the bottom of my hands. I have to roll them up to my elbows to get them to stay, and it looks weird. The color is great. It\u2019s a dusty light Pink, but not pastel. It\u2019s not exactly oversized, but roomy enough. I will keep this one, because it matches the floral print in my jeggings so well. There was another color I wanted, but won\u2019t order this style again unless it\u2019s for my son, I think he would love these! The material is nice, soft and warm. The color is saturated and not heather print (some brands don\u2019t specify). I hope they continue to offer these on layaway, so I can get some for him. 3 stars for women, 5 for men (as intended). I hope the wrists aren\u2019t baggy on him, too. He\u2019s a Medium, so, hopefully, they will be smaller in his size. If they\u2019re still on layaway, I will definitely let him try one and see! I know I will wear this a lot, around the house and for errands of my night school classes.",
