                "reviewText": "My husband likes this turtleneck very much. It is comfortable and looks good. Usually he wears a medium size, but it was too large for him. He kept it, but ordered a small as well, which fits better. He is very slender but has wide shoulders. We washed it to be sure it would not shrink, and it fits well. So if you have an athletic build and are on the border between two sizes, you might do better with the smaller size, unless you like a loose fit. We bought another in a different color.",

So far they seem to wear very well.Very comfortable, they wick away moisture and dry quickly. They have a nice soft feel and are a perfect T-shirt for covering up when the temperature warrants it.They come in TALLS. Great for us long armed folks. You can move stretch and reach without feeling constrained.Great for layering under a sweater or alone.I usually wait for sales from November through after Christmas to buy so as to get the best holiday price. Check all the various styles at Lands End too. In 2023 that was the best place for deals.",
