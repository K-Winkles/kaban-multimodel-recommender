Something not too heavy and specifically for long plane rides. I found what I was looking for in this set! The material is slightly smooth (almost like neoprene) and gives the set a more polished look than plain cotton. I\u2019m 5\u20194, women\u2019s size 12-14 and bought these pieces in multiple sizes before settling on an XL in both the top and bottoms for a fit that allows enough space for layering underneath without just swallowing me up. Highly recommend this set \u2014 Amazon should market it as unisex and offer in more colors!",

                "reviewText": "The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because the orange is not nearly as bright as the picture. The description color is burnt orange, and that is more accurate. If you are looking for more of a bright orange, keep looking.That said I was very pleasantly surprised by how nice this hoodie is, very comfy fabric and seems very well made. I don't personally love the zippers on the kangaroo pouch, bit I am sure it is useful.",

Ich werde das Set (passende Jogger dazu - diese wurde bereits ausgetauscht) zu einem sp\u00e4teren Zeitpunkt gerne nochmal bestellen, dann aber definitiv kleiner.Deshalb auch gerne f\u00fcnf Sterne, weil es \u00fcberall in den Rezensionen steht und ich es absolut nicht glauben wollte (bei einem anderen Hersteller habe ich n\u00e4mlich 5XL bestellt und die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe passt!)",
