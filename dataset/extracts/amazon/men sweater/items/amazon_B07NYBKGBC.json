                "reviewText": "I like the Amazon Essentials Quarter-Zip Sweaters a lot but wanted to try one with a zipper so I don't have to pull it on and off, which is a pain. My experience with the Quarter-Zips is that they fit well and look sporty (see 3rd pic).This Full-Zip is more convenient to take on and off, but has a few issues compared to the Quarter-Zip. For one, the arms are longer than the same size in the Quarter-Zip and so I have to fold the cuffs back to make them fit (for record I am slim, 5'8\", 150 lbs, and wear 32-33\" sleeves).Second, as others have said, the zipper on the Full-Zip tends to catch on the material around it and you often have to wrestle with it to get it to zip up. Third, the Full-Zip doesn't look quite as sporty and ends up looking more like a \"dad\" sweater. Finally, the Full-Zips are not as warm as the Quarter-Zips.These issues are minor to me since it is so hard to find all-cotton sweaters these days, so I am glad these are being offered. However if I wanted to look my best I would wear the Quarter-Zip and save the Full-Zip for more casual knocking around. And if Amazon can also create some cotton sweaters with patterns, that would be awesome.",

                "reviewText": "Every time I get an Amazon Essentials garment I am impressed. I bought two of these sweaters and love the heck out of them. They are heavy and warm. I wanted a middle to heavy sweater and these are it. I have two knocks on them though. One note I found odd from a review I read from someone else. They mentioned the material around the zipper that makes it hard to zip up. I thought , wow, someone is being really picky but yeah they were right. The zipper is kind of encompassed in the sweater material. I've gotten use to it now but I do wish it was just a little easier to zip up. And the other thing is the sizing. I am 5' 10'' and 170pounds. I bought a large thinking it will be a little big but it will shrink when I wash it, plus I wear it over two shirts. The sleeve length and the shoulder length are a good bit too long, but iI turn the cuffs up and it looks really good, but the arms and torso fit like what I imagined a medium would fit like, almost snug. So it is kind of an odd fit. As far as warmth I work in a large warehouse type building that is typically in the winter between 50 and 60 degrees on a concrete floor. It's always cool. I wear a long sleeve T-shirt, a button down Oxford cloth shirt and this sweater over top and stay very comfortable. I have not washed either one of these sweaters yet. I will post an update as to whether they shrink of not. But again very pleased with how they look and feel and keep me warmUpdate 12 28 21 / My 2nd season of wearing. I have washed and dried these several times and I don't believe they shrink at all. I've now bought 5 different colors and absolutely love them all. The two blue sweaters are closer in color than what it looks like online though. But a great deal.",

                "reviewText": "This sweater is pretty light so it's useful to wear at work. Looks nice too, over a uniform or whatever. I like how the collar sticks up a little bit. Adds a nice flair. It's not super warm though so you'll probably need an extra layer on outside of it. It has some inside pockets I found to be useful though a phone is too heavy for this sweater.. it drags that side down a lot. The only downside that I've found that, when zipped, the zipper line flows down right. So it doesn't have a nice straight line down to my crotch. I adjust it back to the center all the time. Maybe one side is longer than the other? I'm not sure. I washed it once and followed the instructions. Overall, great layering piece.",
