I was wrong it is incredibly soft and my favorite thing to wear with leggings. I loved it so much I came back to purchase a second one.Sizing Reference: I am normally a medium or large in tops. 36DD. I am 5\u20193 and about 160lbs. I wear a size 8/10 in pants. The sweater is long like a tunic and covers my entire butt and hits just below the hip, past my fingertips.Quality Fabric & Cut: The sweater is very soft. It is a medium thickness. I have washed and dried both sweaters at lease 10 times and they have held up very well. I was impressed how both sweaters are identical in cut and fit. Due to the impeccable quality of the fabric you are able to stretch the sweater when wet to to make it longer or wider if needed with out causing the sweater to loose it\u2019s structure.Washing and Upkeep: The sweater washes very well. I put it in the washer in delicate and lay it flat on a drying rack to dry. Due to the thickness it does take at least 10 hours to fully dry. The fabric is not pilling or fraying.",
