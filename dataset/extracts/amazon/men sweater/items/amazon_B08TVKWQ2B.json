                "reviewText": "UPDATEHaving now washed 2 of the sweaters I ordered two times, I do want to bring up one downside: They shed and fuzz like crazy! Definitely do not wash with your dress slacks . . . you'll end up with some very fuzzy pants. I do not use fabric softener in the wash, and I used cold/cold and a delicate cycle like the instructiosn said. It made no difference.I still like them, but I'm docking one star since they do not come out of the wash looking the same as they went in. Before washing, they are very slick looking. After being in the wash, they come out resembling fleece (slight exaggeration, but only slight). Not a deal breaker, but not quite what I wanted. My workplace is casual enough that I can still wear them to work. I imagine some companies would not consider them appropriate because of this one factor.Comfort, overall shape and everything are still great after washing. No shrinking at all! (I also do not dry them all the way. 10 minutes on low in the dryer and then they are air-dried.) They're just a little fuzzier.______________________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEWI tried these on . . . and immediately fell irrevocably in love with them! They are soft, very stretchy and oversized (which is exactly what I wanted) and exceeded my expectations in every area. The Amazon Essentials brand is becoming a go-to for me.As a sidenote, these are that odd combination of light and warm that means I'll likely be able to wear them all year long (the office at work hovers around 70 degrees in the summer thanks to the AC).Amazon, you knocked it out of the park with these! Home run!",

Forse \u00e8 pensato per chi \u00e8 costretto a stare all'aperto nei mesi invernali, oppure per chi soffre molto il freddo. Comunque, \u00e8 molto ben rifinito e ha un'ottima vestibilit\u00e0 perch\u00e9, essendo molto morbido, cede parecchio quando viene indossato, per cui nel dubbio consiglio di comprare una taglia in meno.",
