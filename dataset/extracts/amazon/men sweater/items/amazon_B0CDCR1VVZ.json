The tight knit means it could be worn under a blazer if desired, or with a turtleneck underneath for extra warmth, without too much bulk.The sleeves are good and long and the torso is also long enough for a tall man. The XL aspect is where the sweater seems a tiny bit skimpy. I guess it is hard to precisely define XL. This one could be a little more generous in the cut in that regard.Overall, a good solid sweater that should be useful in a number of settings and goes with jeans or nicer pants.",

I'd say it's definitely for a taller man with broad shoulders, but the room in the belly area isn't quite as large as you'd expect for an XL. I'm a woman and I have hips and a butt, if you were a big guy and needed extra room, I'd go one size larger.Pros:-Nicely made-Looks good-long in both body and armsCons:-not as soft or warm as I'd expect for a sweaterConclusion:-I'd buy it again, it's nice and presentable and durable._____________________My rating system:5 Stars: Blew my mind, excellent.4 Stars: Really good.3 Stars: Average, nothing to write home about.2 Stars: It has some problems.1 Star: I don't like it and wouldn't get it.",

I\u2019m familiar with the Chaps brand, so I figured it would be a good choice.I am very happy with both the fit and quality of this sweater. I ordered an XL Tall, and it runs very true to size. It\u2019s both long enough in the body and the arms, and adequately sized across the chest.The quality of this \u2018Chaps Men's Big and Tall Sweater\u2019 is very good as well. The weave is tight, and there are no loose threads or loose seams. The sweater feels very heavy when you hold it, so I know it\u2019s a dense weave. The sweater has good elasticity as well.This sweater looks good on, too. I like that the neckline is high\u2026I know it won\u2019t sag. And it drapes well.All in all, this \u2018Chaps Men's Big and Tall Sweater\u2019 is good choice in my opinion for a basic black sweater. The quality is good..the sizing is accurate\u2026and it looks and feels great on. I can definitely recommend it.",
