For one thing, most men's clothes don't need the special laundering requirements of a lot of women's clothing. Any shrinkage is negligible since its already too big. And bigger shirts/sweaters are just freaking comfy. That said, LOVE this rugby shirt. I got the blue/green striped one in XXL ($18). I'm 5'4\" and this hits just below my bum and the sleeves just reach the end of my fingertips. Soft! I don't know the proper terms, but it comes across as between a sweater and sweatshirt material. Looks cute with tighter jeans and tennis shoes. I'm lucky enough I can wear this stuff to work, but it's also my weekend attire as well. Just layer it with a long sleeve t shirt underneath and I can run errands without lugging a jacket around at least until true winter hits, lol. I have the orange/white striped one in my cart for future purchase.",
