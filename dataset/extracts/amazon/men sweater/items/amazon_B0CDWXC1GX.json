I suspect this will last me for many years. I haven't washed it yet, but I think the color and fabric will hold up nicely. I probably would have tried a size smaller but, it might have been too small. Overall, I am happy and can easily recommend this pullover for anyone looking for one.",

I haven't noticed much pilling with this sweater but we have removed lint balls with a lint brush. This sweater looks well made and my husband has gotten many compliments while wearing it. It is very stylish and is eyecatching. It would also be great for work or casually. We are going to get more in other colors. We recommend this sweater.",

                "reviewText": "Objectively, this is a nice enough sweater. Body types vary, and the appearance of this sweater will vary also depending on the person wearing it. Maybe I'm not much of a sweater guy, but this sweater felt big and bulky on me, and quite heavy, and a lot of what makes it different in appearance than other sweaters seemed secondary to the bulkiness when I looked at myself in the mirror. I'm a shorter guy, at 5'6\", and also on the smaller end of large, so maybe that played a role in making this sweater look so bulky.This sweater will definitely keep you warm in the dead of winter or in colder climates. The neck is actually comfy, hugging like a turtleneck, and will add to the warmth it holds in. I can't see any way of wearing this in weather that isn't freezing, unless you are quite prone to getting cold easily.I can't find any fault with this sweater, and it might deserve at least 3 and 1/2 stars, but I can't add that half-star. I also can't find any way this sweater stands out above any other sweater, so I'm not rating it higher.",
