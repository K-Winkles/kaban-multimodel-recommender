                "reviewText": "This green flame sweater is made from 100% Acrylic yarn and it is so soft. It isn\u2019t rough or scratchy at all. I found it extremely comfortable to wear all day.It probably isn\u2019t the warmest sweater. I live in California and the fact that I could be comfortable wearing this when the temperature is in the 60s indicates that it\u2019s great as a fashion piece, but if you\u2019re in a Northern state or somewhere that gets \u201creal\u201d winters, this will not be enough unless it\u2019s one of many layers.Another indicator that it\u2019s on the thin side is that you can very clearly see the second layer of yarn from the underside of the fabric. For example, white yarns can be seen in the ribbing of the black areas, and black can be seen poking through the green areas. This has the effect of subduing the colors of the sweater - the colors aren\u2019t nearly as vibrant as you see in the stock photos, and from a distance the black looks like more of a dark grey because of all the lighter color behind the black yarn.I also found that the sleeves seemed a little short compared to the torso. I had planned for an oversized look, but the sleeves fit more like a small woman\u2019s sweater so the fit ends up looking a little weird because the main body is still sized to a man.",

She practically lives in it because it's not just a piece of clothing; it's a comfort haven. The flame graphic adds that cool Y2K aesthetic we all love. But what truly seals the deal is the softness and comfort \u2013 according to my wife, it's like wearing a cozy hug. Whether it's a casual day out or a relaxed evening at home, this sweater is her go-to choice. It's a fashion win without sacrificing comfort. Highly recommend for those who want to embrace style without compromising on coziness!",
