It looks great and it fits perfectly. It is a decent thickness of material so it will keep me warm when the cooler weather comes. Perfect for outdoors or indoors. The best part is they estimated about 16 days for it to arrive and it got here and cleared customs in about 6 days which was a great surprise.",
