                "reviewText": "What a surprise to find a garment that runs large!Reading reviews, indeed this Wrangler fleece quarter zip runs large, so I ordered a size Large and it fit hubby perfectly - as he wears this over a dress shirt at a casual work setting. ( Amazon Basic quarter zip pullover fit him great in size XL, just to compare sizes.)The fabric is a lighter to midweight fleece- type fabric, but the exterior of the pullover seems to have a nap to it... that can catch little pieces of things ( like when cutting cardboard boxes at work ) and sticks on.It wouldn't be noticeable if worn going out to eat or something ... but just to mention that.The contrast inner collar appears as a shiny fabric surface in the photos, but in person is a lot more subtle and appropriate to the casual style of the pullover. (The dark blue Mood Indigo color has a black fabric collar and is almost matte in terms of sheen.)Washing per instructions inside- out (protects the 1/4 zipper ) takes care of the pieces stuck on the fabric and it washes and dries up beautifully, with no changes in size.Would order again.",

                "reviewText": "I am 6'4\", 280lbs., with a 37-inch sleeve in a dress shirt. The Wrangler Fleece quarter zip is well-made, with an excellent zipper and zipper fob. I ordered a size XXL and it was too big for me. There is no cuffing or trim on the sleeves or the bottoms of the body, so the sweatshirt hangs loose on you. The sleeves were well past my wrist with my arms down and the body was 5 inches or so below the beltline. It drapes the body rather than conforming to it. The inside of the fabric is very comfortable and warm. The outside is made of a rough-cut material that gathers lint and crumbs and is hard to pick these items off the material without pulling on the cloth potentially making it pill up. I paid more for this item than the usual zippered sweatshirt and expected it to be a better, more stylish fit.",
