Usually wear womens S/M tops (5'3\", 112), but wanted this oversized so tried both mens Small and Med. The Small fit roomy enough and sleeves were good length, but I kept the Med because it was longer and waistband was looser (however, then the sleeves were longer, too--had to roll). It didn't seem to shrink after the first wash. As for color, if you look at the screenshot, attached, of the green/forest color on the website (left image on model) side by side with the blue/green color not worn by the model (right image), the true color of the item is very close to the blue/green color depicted in the right image.",

This shirt is 'by Hanes' but not like they were. it is very much thinner and the inside is not soft, but more like the old shirts were after a year and many washings had passed by. The sweatshirt I am wearing as I type this is cozy and comfy. The new one is not. It is definitly an inferior product. I will buy sweatshirts only in person going forward so that I can make sure that I buy ones that will be comfortable.",

It was a different picture when I purchased mine so just keep in mind your cypress green may be different than my pictures. It\u2019s thin yet warm, great quality.
