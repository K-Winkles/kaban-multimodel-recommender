                "reviewText": "Super comfy! I absolutely loved how this felt on me. It\u2019s very breathable, fits snugly since it\u2019s slim fit but wasn\u2019t too tight. The fabric stretches which is also a plus. The neck was a bit tighter than I expected, but luckily I was able to stretch it a bit to adjust the tightness. I highly recommend this shirt and will be ordering another one in a different color.",
