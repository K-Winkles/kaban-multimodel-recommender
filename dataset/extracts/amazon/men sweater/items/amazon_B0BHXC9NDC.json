The very best part, actually, is the fact this jacket can breathe. I can wear it biking across town, or hiking up a steep hill in the summer even, and not get too hot, since it breathes well.",

                "reviewText": "I got this as a layer for an upcoming trip to South America. I've worn it for a few weeks here in the cool Spring of Michigan. Very nice, warm, lightweight, deep pockets, comfortable collar. It looks sharp in the color I got (gray). Only minor concern is the collar is also fleece, and while it is soft, it does attract skin flakes, hair, etc. If you keep it zipped up, the collar will flip up too and no one will notice. This is a good value.",
