                "reviewText": "For the most part I really like this shirt. The material is a bit thinner than expected so it will have some temperature limitations and the build fits me just fine but I'm thinner boned than the average guy so it's easy to see how some would find it too tight, especially in the arms. Not sure how I feel about the banded cuffs, kind'a wish they'd been done differently but that's nit picking. Standup collar is nice, not too short and not too tall and front pocket, whether useful or not, is something you don't see very often in a garment like this. Hasn't been washed yet so we'll see how that goes. Overall this is a good value so I'll probably buy a couple more in different colors. We'll see after a few washings but out of the bag it's extremely soft and comfortable on the skin.",

Fit and sizing are perfect by my standards and the full length kangaroo pocket with zippers is the cherry on top. The price is great for the quality and unless the seams start splitting after a couple of washes, I will be back for more.",

This one is about average with that, but I love the pattern (Dark Green Navy Tartan Plaid) so much that I still wear it regularly. It's nicely soft, fits better than most on my weird frame, and has a nice big, dual-zippered pouch pocket in the front. Solidly crafted item, just seems sturdy. So glad I grabbed this deal!",
