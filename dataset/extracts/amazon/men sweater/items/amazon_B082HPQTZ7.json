                "reviewText": "So, a bit of back story. I am a high school teacher and each year, I try to form an new \"English Teacher\" look to keep life spicy and interesting. Normally, I just buy a different blazer each year for my new \"uniform.\" This year, I switched gears and decided to step up my cardigan game. I bought about 12 different colored cardigans in the traditional style. For quite a while, I was really digging my new Mr. Roger's vibe.Then, the Fates, Destiny, or Providence (whatever power or force that is beyond human comprehension) forged a different path for me. While innocently browsing, I found this cardigan. Initially, I was hesitant. It looked too feminine, but there is a dude of the male persuasion in the advertisement's picture. I thought, \"If he can pull this look off, maybe I can!\" So, I place my order. Next, I await its delivery with apprehension and restrained joy.Finally, the day comes. My new cardigan arrives and the instant I put it on, I feel like how Thor must feel when he grasps Mjolnir. Lightning strikes, thunder reverberates, and Asgardian magic clothes him with shimmering armor and a majestic draping cape. This experience was the closest I have ever felt to being Transfigured. I have read and seen the famous sculpture of the Transverberation of St. Theresa of Avila. I have studied the ecstasy and bliss of Joseph of Cupertino in flight, but I never expected to fly like Icarus, Phaeton, or Orville Redenbacher. This magic is akin to Harry Potter's Cloak of Invisibility; I saw myself, but others could not see me. Franz Kafka is probably spinning in his grave. He never knew the extent of metamorphosis.Still, I wanted to be safe before I reveled my new sartorial sensation to the world and more importantly my studious students and fellow faculty. (Side note: I teach at a very conservative school. I do not want to invite scandal.) The next day, I wear my standard haberdashery, a normal cardigan. Gingerly, I pack my new zooty addition in my satchel. After arriving in the classroom, before first period, I invite the members of my department into my classroom to render a judgement of vogue. Unfortunately, after my cat walk, the verdict was unanimous. My new fancy manner was just too fabulous for the high school classroom. Dejected, I returned \"my precious\" to the satchel. I wrapped my new shame with my normal, basic, standard buttoned garb. I felt as awkward as Adam and Eve after they realized their nakidity. But, the damage was done; my eyes were forever opened.After I returned home, I changed into pajamas as is my usual. I love to be comfortable and pajamas are super comfortable. Then, I realized I could add this \"Men's Ruffle Shawl Collar Cardigan Lightweight Cotton Blend Long Length Drape\" to my evening apparel. Wow! The majesty of Thor paired with the silken stylings of night sleep gear is a marriage made in Heaven! The pockets are large enough to hold my phone and provide adequate protection so it will not fall out. Initially, I furiously tested these two pockets. I strolled, strutted, strided, sauntered, and sprinted around the house. I flourished my turns and cornered each hallway and door entrance. They held on to their contents like a mother lovingly and protectively embracing their newborn. These fantastic flourishes were enhanced by the breezy billows of the bottom of the cardigan. Then, I tested the cardigan's ability in the bed. It lovingly hugged me and I slept the sleep of the just. This fabric breathes and protects like Frodo's Mithril Shirt. I am confident that even the Dwarves of Middle Earth, no matter the Age, could not produce the majesty of royal courts intertwined with the cozy comforts of the Shire as well as this covering that fits like a glove or second epidermis. When I woke, fully revived, I felt born anew. This joy was only heightened when I saw my refection in the mirror. My classed up pajamas staring back at me was the ultimate Adonis moment. It was like the mythic moments that the poets wrote of in ages of old. I am sure in 1,000 years, young men and women will be reading this story with their breath held wondering what \"dreams may come.\" The philosophical question of the future will not be: \"Is there a God?\" It will be \"where can I buy this cardigan?\"I might not be able to show the world my true identity that is now inherently tided to this garment. I may have to live a Dorian Gray-esque existence, but it is worth it. During the day, I am a mild-mannered high school English Teacher, but in the darkness of night, I wear my true superhero threads and am the Hero and Protector of all things relaxing, cozy, and slumbering.Please buy this product and transform your life and world.Finally, I want to thank the brilliant people of COOFANDY, who I can only imagine loomed this cardigan with the gossamer of gods and sewed it in the heart of a dying star.",
