                "reviewText": "I bought one of these for my husband and liked it enough to buy one for myself. Only problem was figuring out what size to get (I'm a 4'11\", 139 lb woman, but prefer men's sweatshirts). I initially ordered a medium that was too big and exchanged it for a small which fits fine. I initially didn't like the way the small looked (it was baggy in weird places), but it was that the fabric was a bit stiff from being in the bag. Once I wore it in a bit, it was fine. I haven't washed it yet, but based on the other reviews I'll probably hang dry it to avoid shrinking.Overall the quality is good! Fabric is soft; stitching is even and appears reinforced around seams and pockets. Among similar, sherpa-lined sweatshirts, I chose this one because the sherpa lining is only in the chest area - the sleeves are lined with cotton which feels less itchy when wearing t-shirts underneath.",

I bought a larger size that I really need which will be good to wear a sweater under if needed. I\u2019m very happy with this jacket! I will say it\u2019s more for my walks than out on the town.",

                "reviewText": "This sweatshirt is not only stylish, but it also keeps me incredibly warm during these chilly winter months.The shell of this sweatshirt is made from a blend of 56% cotton and 44% polyester, which gives it a comfortable and cozy feel. The lining, on the other hand, is made from 100% polyester Sherpa material that is incredibly soft and plush. It's like wearing a warm blanket!The zip-up front is not only convenient but also adds to the overall style of the sweatshirt. The split pockets are a great addition for keeping my hands warm or storing small items. The ribbed cuffs and hem do an excellent job of sealing in warmth and preventing any cold air from sneaking in.I like the drawstring at the hood. It allows me to adjust the hood to my liking, ensuring that I can lock in even more warmth when needed. It's a small detail, but it makes a big difference.What sets this sweatshirt apart is the attention to detail that Amazon Essentials has put into it. They have listened to customer feedback and fine-tuned every aspect to ensure the best quality, fit, and comfort. And they have succeeded in that regard. It's a welcome addition to any wardrobe, providing both style and warmth.",
