                "reviewText": "Cons:1.) Size: runs small. I am 5 foot 8 and 200 lbs, big chest and broad shoulders\u2014I have found large to typically be a good size for most brands, Amazon Essentials consistently runs smaller than most brands. It does fit, and I do think it looks nice, but it is a bit shorter, and the shoulders are cut tighter which makes it seem smaller to me at least.2.) Material: Amazon Essentials clothing generally I have found to be made of very thin material compared to say, Goodthreads. It does not instill confidence that it will last a long time or through very many washes.Pros:1.) SOFT. The material may be thin but it is definitely soft.2.) Appearance: I have two cardigans from Amazon Essentials, and two from Goodthreads. While I do score my Goodthreads cardigans more highly, they are also more costly. In the category of appearance though? I think the colors on the Amazon Essentials are nicer, and I do actually think they might look better, I like to wear cardigans for work.3.) Price/value: GREAT value for the price. Maybe unbeatable value.Notes: they are warm but not as warm as some others and I think that could be good or bad depending on your internal temperature and what you prefer. 4/5 stars, would recommend these cardigans.",

But you should size up when ordering, because they will shrink significantly when you wash the first time. If you need an XL, then buy a 2X, etc.These are very versatile garments. They pair extremely well with jeans and dress slacks, but also made a great replacement for a suit jacket, wearing a shirt and tie, in a few situations for me.They are a fairly lightweight material and I wouldn't say they are \"warm\". The material is a bit porous, so in certain situations you might feel the air or a breeze getting through.I've purchased these in a variety of colors and in sizes XL - 2XL.Overall I say these are an excellent value and a great addition to your wardrobe if you want to step it up a bit.",

                "reviewText": "Previously, cardigans were not something that had been a part of my wardrobe. I'm working in a new office and the governance of the thermostat is not as consistent as I'd like it to be. Dressing like a kid is out of the question now for reasons that don't have to be said, and besides all my hoodies hang off of me like a burlap sack. I like wearing this because it's light, soft, and surprisingly warm. Another thing I like is how the tapered opening of the standard collar lets me show of my printed dress shirts. The neutral color of the cardigan contrasts nicely with the splash of color there.",
