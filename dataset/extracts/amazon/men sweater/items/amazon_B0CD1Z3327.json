                "reviewText": "It's hard to find mock neck shirts for some reason. This find was absolutely perfect for what I wanted. The material is super soft, and fits me perfectly. I use it for an layer under my nice v-neck and 1/4 zip sweaters. The mock neck has just the right amount of tightness so it doesn't sag or fold over like some others. A few more dollars for Land's End quality, but it's worth it and I'm going to buy some other colors now that I know how good it is.",

                "reviewText": "Being tall and thin, finding mocks that aren\u2019t baggy around the neck can be a real pain. These fit like a charm. If you are buying for a heavier person, though, the collar might be tight. You just have to try one and see. If the fit works out, you\u2019ll love them. The supema cotton is soooo comfortable. Plus, it can be thrown in the dryer at full heat without fear of shrinking, the way traditional cotton does. TIP: To keep the neck from getting stretched out in the wash, I always use a garment bag (aka lingerie bag).They aren\u2019t particularly inexpensive compared to regular cotton mocks, but they do go on sale pretty regularly. One of my cold season favorites.",
