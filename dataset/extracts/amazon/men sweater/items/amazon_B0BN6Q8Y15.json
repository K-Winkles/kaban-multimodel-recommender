                "reviewText": "I bought this as an impulse while browsing for Halloween decorations... this cardigan is more like a hooded cloak, and makes me feel incredibly sexy and powerful. Dress it up, or don't dress at all... either way, this is way too much fun. The material is heavy duty, yet lightweight and stretchy all at once. By the way, it's also very very very long. I am tall-ish for a woman (5'7\"), and it almost touches the floor at its longest points. The pockets are legit! However, because it is so flowy, I wouldn't really put anything of significant weight in them. The weight of an object in only one pocket throws everything off balance with the cardigan, and I felt like I was spending too much time readjusting my outfit.",

Think T-shirt and you are close. It will keep a chill off, better than you might expect, and flows nicely while you\u2019re strutting along. It IS oversized, though there is a size chart, now, which helps, so consider that you may want to go down a size.I give it three for two reasons. First, I had expected a front drape similar to their kimono styled tops (which are awesome btw). I ordered too big based on that. Second, do to the design and lack of fasteners, if the wind hits you right, at all, the hood will billow out like a spinnaker until it comes off your head.",

I am thinking of exchanging for a medium, it is that big.Super soft fabric, thin like a t-shirt material.I do like the style and how comfortable it is, just wish it wasnt so long. P.s. I know it's a men's item, but I was hoping it wld fit only slightly large so I could share it with my husband.
