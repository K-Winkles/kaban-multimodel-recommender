Had a small issue with the setup (because I was using it with only \" fair\" wifi signal, so that was my fault) and a small issue with the tablet resetting itself once so far. Other than that, it works great! Fantastic buy for the money!",

YOU TURN IT ON AND IT IMMEDIATELY STARTS DROPPING; WITHIN 15 MINUTES IT DROPS TO LIKE 86% - WHETHER YOU ARE USING IT OR NOT. I USE IT WITHOUT THE KEYBOARD BECAUSE WHEN FIRST GOT, IT WAS DIFFICULT TO HOOK UP. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET SOMETHING WITH BETTER BATTERY AND MORE MEMORY.",
