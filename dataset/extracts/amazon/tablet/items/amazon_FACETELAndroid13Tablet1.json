This should give me more than enough storage for years to come. I love the fact that this device does not come loaded w/ bloatware. The peripherals, i.e. keyboard and mouse are great. I am actually using the keyboard to type this review and it works flawlessly. I had another Chinese tablet from LNMBBS that I had to return due to issues w/ the software. This Facetel tablet has really impressed me with it's speed. I am not a gamer so I do not know how it would work with processor intense games. I use it for email, news, and video. I use it for about an hour a day. I did notice that the battery seems to work best if you drain it and then charge it. When I got it the battery was almost fully charged and I noticed that the battery seemed to be going down fairly quickly. I let it go down to about 10% and then charged it to full. The battery is now lasting about three days with my amount of usage. It is on it's third day today and it is at 24%. If you are watching movies for several hours a day I suspect you would need to charge daily. I use the tablet to view my security cameras and the video streams very smoothly. All in all I am extremely happy with this device and would definetly recommend to a friend. You can pay a lot more for Apple or Samsung but this tablet meets all my needs and then some.Update: I have now had the tablet for more than a month and am even more impressed. I have been using it to cast video to my t.v. 's and it works great. If you were going to get the same performance from one of the big brands, I suspect you would have to pay more than twice as much. Great tablet.",

The usb stick is type A with an adapter to go into the type C on the tablet. I've already misplaced it the usb dongle. I will have to order a bluetooth mouse, which is what should have come with this product in the first place. Other than that the tablet is great. It is fast enough for what I want to do. I'm not running any games on it.",

Plus, the usual charger and cord. It's an excellent tablet and very good price.",

If all you need to do is some basic tasks like writing emails, reading books, take online training, WeChat etc, it will suffice you in a very reasonable price. I am very satisfied with this purchase. The tablet is running pretty fast and touch screen is sensitive. The battery life is good too. I own an iPad too, the experience is quite similar if you learn Android one way or anther. I don't see why you need to spend several hundred dollars more for an iPad, and another hundred dollar of more for accessories. This package has all you need to get your work done.",

I am going to order another one of these tablets as soon as my refund hits my account. I will update again after I receive the second facetel tabletUPDATE: I ordered a second tablet and this one is much much better 10% battery loss an hour with battery saved off which is a lot more doable than 20% loss with battery saver on.",
