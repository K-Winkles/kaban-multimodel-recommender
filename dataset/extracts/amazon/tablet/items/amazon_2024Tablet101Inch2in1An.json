Clarity is perfection and it is so much quicker than any of my other devices. And let me tell you, the picture quality is great too. It comes with a mouse, keyboard and cover. Excellent price and has the quality of more expensive tablets. I can do everything I need to on this device, and it is small enough to pop in my purse or keep on my bedside table. My 12-year-old keeps trying to borrow it! Maybe another for Christmas???",

                "reviewText": "So far I am completely satisfied with this product. It arrived promptly and was well packaged. It was easy to set up and I have used non stop since it arrived? It is a sturdy tablet that is just the right size. The case is very nice along with all the other accessories. I highly recommend this economical tablet.Update August 25th: Though I still really like this tablet the one problem seems to be it doesn't hold a charge well. People have mentioned good battery life but my experience is that it should hold a charge much longer than it is.Update Sept 1, 2023: I have been in contact with the company customer service concerning the faulty battery. They are quick to reply. I have been redirected to their company email address which takes me out of the Amazon loop but I have complied. I am suppose to be getting instructions about a replacement. I will update again as this progresses.Update Sept 13The customer service is amazing. They sent a message a new tablet was being; sent. I received it today. They didn't just send the tablet but an entirely new package with everything. I am very surprised. Though I am not presently home to set it up I am hoping this one works out better. If nothing else I will say the company stands behind their product.Update Sept 27thI still give this a 5 star rating but only because of the company that sells it. It's a great little tablet but even the second tablet doesn't hold a charge long. With all the apps closed and screens cleared it appears to get to the 20% level with very limited use and needs to be charged every couple of days. This is the final update on this product for me. It is worth the price but just keep in mind it has, in my opinion, a short battery life. Everything else is good.....cheers!",

Not games or watching videos, though in testing videos it was fine for that. I'm sort of a power user of Windows for 25 years and Android phones/tablets.This was a great little tablet, fast once started, functioned pretty well for my objectives - not equivalent to Window laptops.. but covered most things I wanted for a tablet. I had to return it mostly because of the weight. After holding for an hour, my arthritic wrists would start hurting.",

                "reviewText": "This device with 10 pieces to it in total is such a great find for me because of the number of accessories that comes with the unit, the price, excellent customer service, and ease of use. This neat and very convenient little tablet is 10 inches on the diagonal with an 8.5 inch high screen. It is excellent to take with you in your purse or case to work or vacation, and excellent size for your grandkids or children (if you can put some parental controls.)I had a temporary issue with sound loss, contacted support, they responded immediately and provided instructions as to how to fix the problem. The reset fixed the problem and I have not had any issues since as of the time of writing this review. They also informed me that I could activate the product's VIP Club App extra year of warranty after the first year is over and they assured me that they would assist with any technical issues that might occur.I purchased this unit mainly to listen to training videos and for entrepreneur work purposes. I know that there will be more things I will end up discovering...I enjoyed learning that I could voice dictate this review if I wanted to. I am actually looking forward to learning more of what I can do with it. I appreciate being able to have this handy little device for a very reasonable cost that didn't break my pocket!",

The art app that came with the tablet has also got my wife captivated... she can't put it down. Battery holds up well and recharges relatively quickly. My only disappointment is that it didn't come with earbuds. Otherwise, we love it and would thoroughly recommend it.",
