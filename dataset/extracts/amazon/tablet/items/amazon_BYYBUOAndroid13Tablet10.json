I mainly purchased it to watch/listen to my shows right before bed, my background noise without having to have a tv in my room. It does what I need but not without distorted lagging starting and stopping apps. I can't use it for anything without it adding time to do the task so useless except the bare minimum. It works but not good. Very disappointed.",
