                "reviewText": "Tablet is... quirky. A lot of restarts have been needed, it freezes up often. It does have 64GB space, but only 4GB RAM and not 8 as advertised. Ok for the price but not sure why they're lying about the RAM. Also the size is unusual, been having a hard time finding cases or screen protectors that fit appropriately.After using this for a month or so, dropping to 2 stars. Tablet still freezes up often, requires multiple daily reboots to continue working. Seller contacted and promised they'd send a replacement but haven't so far. So yes it works, but not well at all.",

                "reviewText": "This tablet is great if you\u2019re looking for something inexpensive that can handle basic tasks. I got this for watching videos while traveling and wanted something that could handle basic entertainment functions, without breaking the bank. This tablet works and responds well. It was a little slow with some functions but for the price, I can\u2019t complain. It seems fairly durable, especially if you get a case. Would make a great tablet for a child.",
