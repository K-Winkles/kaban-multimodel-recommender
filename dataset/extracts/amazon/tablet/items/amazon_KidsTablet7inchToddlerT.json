I can have total control of it, from the apps to her daily time limit and \"breaks\". The main app is iWawa and I opted to pay the $1.99 a month for no ads on predownalded apps. Others, just turn off wifi! Simple to use, durable so far (shes a klutz). I was originally against tablets for kids until my son started school and I saw how much they were used. I highly recommend the \"Endless\" apps! Battery runs down a little fast but charges fast.",

The pink one was canceled due to stock and had to be re ordered at a later date.The orange one I have zero complaints about. Awesome for the price.As for the pink one, it withstood a few drops, but after the most recent one, it no longer charges. The battery life on this tablet was really poor the last few months also, and it was never as good as the other one. The other tablet appears to be the same other than color, but the software had minor differences as well. I didn't think much of the differences originally, but seeing as this one degraded significantly in under a year and is now no longer usable and the other has had no apparent change in function with a comparable level of use and abuse definitely says something. Unfortunately, I would expect any future purchases to compare to the pink one, not the orange one.",
