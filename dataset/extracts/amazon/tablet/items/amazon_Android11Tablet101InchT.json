Unfortunately the glass of the screen has dislodged from the back of the tablet on the lower left side. This has created BIG problems with charging since that's where the cord attaches. Now I can't take it out of the house for fear of various elements compromising it through the gap. And to charge the tablet I have to push the screen glass down until the charging port is lined up with the body just to plug it in. Fortunately, the battery lasts a long time and I only have to charge it every other day.",
