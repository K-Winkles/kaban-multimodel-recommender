I am happy to report that this tablet does not have any third party suspicious apps nor any shady pending updates.The performance of the tablet is decent. Movie image quality is crispy clear. The speakers are not load but they sound great.Gaming: this tablet won't support games with high graphics. Check out my video editing. I am using the game Star Rail to test the tablet. The tablet cannot handle the game. Nonetheless, the game runs smoothly with lower graphics games. Another favorite game of mine is Reverse 1999 and I am happy to say that the tablet managed this game with no problem. Plus, the tablet comes in a bundle with a keyboard, mouse, dongle USB-A to USB-C, a case, and screen protector! Not bad at all!",

                "reviewText": "I am very impressed with this tablet. The battery life is amazing, it lasts for days on a single charge. The keyboard and mouse are easy to connect and use.But what I love most about this tablet is that it runs a very clean AOSP build of Android 13, with only two preinstalled apps and both of them are removable. And GMS is preinstalled. The tablet is fast, responsive, and secure, with no bloatware or ads.I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cost-effective tablet. It is worth every penny, and I am very happy with my purchase.",
