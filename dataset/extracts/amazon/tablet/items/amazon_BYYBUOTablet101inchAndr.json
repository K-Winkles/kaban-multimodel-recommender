                "reviewText": "Looking for a tablet that looks and performs like the big brand tablets on the market? Look no further.I browsed Amazon and looked at more than a hundred different tablets. Most of the specs on them are horrible, however this tablet has excellent hardware and doesn't come preinstalled with a bunch of app bloat that you can't get rid of. It basically works right out of the box, comes with Android 12, and has a fast and sharp display. I bought two of these for my kids to play games and watch videos and this works great.The only negative for me was not having an option to buy a case specifically for this tablet. I had to go out and find a \"generic 10\" tablet\" case which fits, but isn't perfect. Outside of that, I would highly recommend this to anyone else looking for a great tablet at a low price.",

Set up was easy and has a great battery life. 64GB of storage which is actually more than my tablet has. Downfall is not having a specified case/screen protector for it.",
