                "reviewText": "This particular model of tablet is the size I prefer, not too big but not as small as my smartphone. The screen resolution is clear and bright and all the features it has work well. Once you get used to where everything is, it's not hard to operate at all. My past tablets I have used were either too large and too heavy, but this one is a nice moderate size and is a bit lighter weight. The tablet was simple to set up. Once I fully charged it and connected to WiFi, I just followed the on screen prompts. I was able to opt out of anything that I wanted to so my privacy remained intact. Battery life was around 5-6 hrs when used continuously to watch movie. This tablet is very responsive both on the touch screen and on connecting to the internet. It not only makes a great travel companion but also works as a clear e-reader and multi-media source. Highly recommended!!",

Took a really long time to install Microsoft Teams, and it kept crashing and not updating in my chats. Realized it just didn't have enough power to run Microsoft Teams (even though it runs a compatible version of Android (11).I realized it was super cheap so tried using it to run a really simple app \"Harmony Remote\" to control my entertainment center. It was able to do this...but about a week after setting it up the screen went dark, and the device bricked. I cannot reset it or restore the OS. It clearly comes on, as I can see the black screen come on, but it never starts up. Made sure it was charged, still couldn't get it to start or reset.",

                "reviewText": "My original review below was spot on, This is a nice little tablet with some drawbacks. However, after a year of use I am going from 3 stars to 4 stars. This 32 gig tablet now contains over two thousand downloaded songs and a hundred books and I still have 15 gigs available. Although the speakers are nothing to speak of, the sound of music through earbuds or bluetooth boom box is absolutely phenomenal. As I previously mentioned, photographs in news stories are better seen from the side, however, book covers and book text are perfect. The wifi download is not the fastest but I use this tablet for the content that is already downloaded. I keep it near by for either music or reading and it serves the purpose beautifully. I have several other devices for surfing the web which are better but also more expensive. I originally bought this tablet for 45.00. No I see it for 38.00 I am getting another one. It does what I need without breaking the bank. See my original review below.I was looking for a super light tablet with a 7 inch screen, but narrow enough to hold easily with one hand. This Android tablet has a 7 inch screen, weighs 8.8 ounces and is only 4.4 inches wide, making it larger than a cell phone but smaller than a Fire 7 or an Apple Mini Pad. Although I already have several Kindles I like to read using the Libera Pro app from Google Play which has a no touch scrolling mode, so there is no constant tapping the screen to turn the page needed. With this pocket sized tablet I can take a quick moment to look up something on the web. However, under 50 dollars you get what you pay for. Photos and video are hard to see and the camera is poor quality, This tablet suits my specific purposes but it is not going to replace any of my regular web devices.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great size tablet if you don't want something too bulky to travel with you. But it's very generically made. The screen is very washed out (not vivid colors). The android version is 11.0 but for some crazy reason, some apps have already stopped supporting it, even though the latest version of android is only 12. This means I couldn't install some apps. The audio through the speakers sounds very tinny and phased (it's trying to convert stereo to mono). Playing audio through the headphones sounds great though. It includes a micro SD card slot, which is very helpful to keep all your music, pics, and docs on there without having to transfer everything to the tablet. If you just want something simple to get by, check emails, do some web surfing, play simple games (like sudoku), this is a decent tablet for that. If you plan on using this for viewing movies, streaming video, heavy gaming, etc, I suggest investing in something with a brand name on it. The video quality is horrible for that. Plus with 2GB of ram, the tablet will be struggling to play games. The tablet lasts for about 4 hours when streaming video.Note regarding the questions and answers section of this product. It looks like anything dating 2021 or earlier is referring to an older version of the item, so just be aware when doing your research. Some answers mention 32GB ROM, but the tablet in fact has a 64GB ROM. Also, this device only connects at 2.4 GHz. It doesn't have 5GHz bandwidth.",
