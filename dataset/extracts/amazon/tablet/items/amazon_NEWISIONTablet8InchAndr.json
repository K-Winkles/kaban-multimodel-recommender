I did not have a cable with a C plug on each end, so I started the transfer via WIFI. The screen indicated that the process would take over two hours, so I left the phone and tablet next to each other and walked away. I returned about an hour later and the tablet was off. I tried to turn it back on, and it will not. The initial screen comes on for about a second, and then a red battery appears on the screen for a second or two before the screen goes black. I have tried to recharge the tablet with both the charger included with the tablet and a charger that I use for my phone, and the tablet does not accept any charge.

My iPad was getting overwhelmed and short on storage room so I wanted to move stuff off. This little tablet fit the bill, and for a really nice price. For my purposes it, covers all the bases. It is fast, the memory is adequate, although I added a flash card for more storage, the picture is really crystal clear, and it has WIFI and Bluetooth. For this price, it really works for me. The one negative is that cases and and screen protectors are almost impossible to find for this model. Big disappointment, so I had to minus one Star.",

                "reviewText": "The tablet comes with almost a full charge on arrival, was easy to set-up but took quite a bit more time to finally get it up and running.Pros ; The price is great, you get all the functionality of a premium tablet.Good for watching videos and simply cruising the internet in bed or wherever you desire. It's small enough to not be a burden to carry anywhere.Cons ;The tablet has a little delay and videos aren't the smoothest, meaning it has a slower refresh rate even when the video is 720-1080p but the actual display is crisp and clear.The battery life isn't the best but isn't the worst either, you'll maybe get roughly 2 1/2 to 3 hours of video streaming from a fill charge before having to plug it in. It doesn't take long to charge but maybe of you lower some settings or wear headphones may extend your battery life.The sound on this tablet is pretty bad. At max volume you'll have to be right near it to hear it. If there's background noise, such as doing dishes while using the tablet, you will not hear it. If you plan on using this tablet anywhere else buy at the quite of your own home, you'll absolutely need some headphones.All and all this is a decent starting tablet, it does everything other tablets at an affordable price point. Don't expect anything ground breaking, it's a tablet, it works. If you're looking to just browse the internet and stream video, this will be perfect.",

So far she hasn\u2019t been using it much. It\u2019s not that she isn\u2019t happy with it she just doesn\u2019t reach for it when her iPad is available. The screen is sharp and the battery seems to last long enough. She likes the smallish size too. If you are familiar with Android you should be fine with this. She was able to load some things off her iPhone onto this so there is that.",

                "reviewText": "Admitedly, I have been spoiled by using an iPad for a number of years, so the performance issues with this tablet are fairly pronounced to me. Setup was simple and the wifi connection has remained stable. Battery life is not great. Playing one music video on YouTube and reading two chapters of an ebook, along with my basic setup, used up half of the battery charge. Video playback is noticeably stuttery, and Google Play Books crashed twice while I was reading. Unless you are holding the camera perfectly still and have a perfectly still subject, you will likely not get a decent photo. Casual browsing and reading are OK. For a bare budget, this is a decent starter tablet. I added a 512GB expansion card and eventually found the setting to set it up to use. You can either dedicate it to use only on the tablet or set it up to be able to transfer media back and forth with other devices.",
