We are always satisfied, the products are reliable and great for the price!We just bought this new 11-inch X800 tablet. The packaging is nice, and contains all the necessary equipment: charger and plug of course, screen protection (easy to install), case and a micro-SD card opener! Since our daughter enjoys taking lots of pictures that feature will probably be useful.The case is very convenient as always and offers a great protection against accidental drops, with additional layers on the corners.Pics look really nice; the cameras quality improve at every release! And the screen resolution is also quite amazing regarding the price of this tablet. Audio is just fine too I\u2019ve been watching TV series and really enjoyed the experience.Setup is a piece of cake. We always use a parental control App, and after a few minutes, the tablet was ready to go!After a few days of use, Android 13 runs great: fast, no bugs, just as it should.Our daughter really loves it and wouldn't be back to her previous one \ud83d\ude42When you consider the price vs quality ratio of this tablet, you can only be amazed!

This one delivered early, instructions tell you to make sure it\u2019s 100% charged before turning on, this one was \u201cin the red\u201d but charged quickly. It\u2019s loaded with everything google. Easy to use, camera was easy to access, the case is just a folio, but it\u2019s decent, has a rubbery textured grip surface inside & out. Great deal for the price.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Nice balance of features",
                "reviewText": "First off -- This tablet is speedy! When used side-by-side with another tablet I own, this one was always faster at loading webpages. Also, the ability to choose whether it was going to be used by an adult or a child, was a smart option.The icons and text were too small at first, but they were easily enlarged (much better!).The clarity of the screen is great! Battery is good -- it's been 3 days now, and still not needing a charge.One of the other features I really like are the multiple speakers. The quad speakers are exactly what I've been needing in a tablet. All other tablets I've owned have required the use of an additional bluetooth speaker when trying to watch something and sit more than a foot away. (I'm old - my hearing is fading). But not this tablet, it's probably the feature I like the most.It was also very nice to have the screen protection already installed. No messing with air bubbles, being placed on straight, etc. Just peel off the outer layer, and it was ready to go. Although a little note on the tablet screen might have helped me figure that out sooner than I did.Speedy, good battery usage, crystal clear screen, super loud speakers -- overall a great value for the money.All in all -- it's a very good set of specs for the price.",
