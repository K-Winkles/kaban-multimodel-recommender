                "reviewText": "So I primarily wanted this for my photography. Something I could show my photos on to my clients without having to take around a big laptop. This this the trick and more!!First the build quality is very nice. It has a metal cast matte feel to it. Feels very sturdy yet so light weight. The screen is nice and bright and is very clear. This just feels like quality.A lot of reviewers want you to stray from buying the entry level model because it's \"super slow and sluggish and not worth the money\" but that couldn't be further from the truth. The fact is, this little machine can multitask very well. I even had a long list of updates to the apps that are already installed and it updated each in minutes and updated maybe 3 or 4 at a time. Done super fast. The browser is smooth and works just fine. It does have a very minor stutter when you load the web page but nothing to get into a fit over. I even tried playing YouTube videos and they work just fine. I pushed it to do 4K and it played very smooth with no stutter or lag. Your internet connection will play a factor but if you've got that good connection then you should have no problem at all. I also have my phone connected to windows and it works great. I can keep focus on my work without having to look at my phone when I can just reply on the tablet itself with no issues.The only downside is, unless you really don't mind using it just as a tablet, I highly recommend getting a mouse and keyboard for it. At the very least a keyboard with track pad. Its very bad choice that Microsoft chose to leave these necessities out of the package. I highly recommend looking at less expensive alternatives to the Microsoft type cover and mouse. I have a $12 Bluetooth mouse and $30 keyboard that works just as well as the type cover. Both these devices have great connections and response times. These 2 devices are key for using this 2 in 1 to its potential. Specially if you're working from home or have some work to do.All in all, this is a great 2 in 1 for the price. At $399 I highly recommend this for anyone looking to do some simple work from home such as video calls, Office projects, or even watch movies and videos or just check social media and have something to take on the go. Works like a charm.Fun side story, when I first got this, I was setting up the tablet. My 1 year old was getting curious and playing with all the accessories that I got. I put the tablet down and was moving the stuff. She grabbed my phone and threw it towards the tablet. The corner of my phone smashed into the screen. Not even an hour of owning it and its getting stuff thrown into it. Tablet was fine, glass screen protector never cracked, and phone was ok. Talk about build quality. Lol",

                "reviewText": "SO. TLDR: It can't even run Paint comfortably.I bought this for myself exclusively to make art in Microsoft Paint during the slow periods at work. Given what I intended to use it for, I didn't think I needed good specs. It's Microsoft Paint, right? It's a robust little program in Windows 11 for what it is, but it's not like it's all that resource-intensive....So anyway, Paint lags on this thing with images that are even slightly middle-high resolution. And it's unstable. And I can very consistently crash it by resizing an image/selection via the resize menu more than once.And it's not like there's other stuff bogging the system down or anything. This is a fresh system. The only things I've installed are a bunch of official Windows updates + the Windows 11 upgrade (haven't even grabbed Chrome yet), and the only files I've added to its storage are images -- some doodles from Paint and some photos from the device's camera.I know this device is lightweight, but, like... *it's MS Paint.* It's not like I'm trying to run a game or stream a movie, I'm just trying to drag a 450x650 selection across an image. And it's lagging to the point that the program is stuttering or flat-out freezing for several seconds at a time. Like, \"I'm using Paint, not PowerPoint\" levels of stuttering. So definitely don't underestimate the reviews when people say it's \"a little slow\" -- the lack of processing power is hard to ignore.I would be returning this and seeking a refund if I didn't trash the packaging without thinking. It's not the desirable option I took it for, not in the slightest.UPDATE: Changing this to one star as I've realized the situation is much, much worse than I'd first realized.Scrolling or zooming -- whether by the scoll bar, trackpad, or on-screen buttons -- causes the device to rapidly input at two points on the image. I do not know why this is the case, and it seems to have varying effects depending on the tool equipped. This ranges from \"Selection tool > selects part of the image/moves the selection\" to \"eraser - erases a streak and the erase can't be undone without undoing your previous 'real' input\" to \"Airbrush.\"I need to talk about the Airbrush.I do not know what is causing it right now, but I can't select the Airbrush tool on this current project because it will somehow create two separate orbs of paint, simultaneously, without me even touching the screen. I have absolutely no clue what would even be causing something like this and the fact that it's doing this is, frankly, appalling. It nearly wrecked my current project because I didn't realize it was happening at first.So, to reiterate: THIS IS NOT A DEVICE FOR ART. Please save your money and don't buy this for att unless you want to know what near-constant loss of productivity feels like.",

I thing the W11 runs a tad slower, I have an older Surface Go that cant be updated yet and it seems slightly faster, not a big deal however. I am not a big fan of android tablets since pretty much anything you do on them is tracked a dozen different ways. On the other hand, a Windows device I have some control of and can add VPN's, anti-tracking items and then configure the browsers more effectively. I recommend the Surface Go.",
