He was using his phone after his old tablet quit working and man, the data charges skyrocketed!!! Now, he hooked into the wifi and it's wonderful not to have any extra data charges!! It is working well for him with other functions as well. Thank you!!",

Unless you turn it off completely.Giving 1 star because it dose work, just really slow.Shipping was all good pretty fast 1 week.I\u2019ve seen good reviews here just hit and miss I guess, unfortunately this time I missed.Hope this helps always buyer beware when purchasing online\u201d cheers.",
