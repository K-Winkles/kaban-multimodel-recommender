                "reviewText": "I'm one of several people who got confused by the way the page denoting prices/storage sizes is laid out, and I originally thought I'd bought myself a 128 GB tablet for $189. It turns out that's the price for the 32 GB. After some wrangling and arguing back and forth, I did get the 128 GB tablet I was originally looking for (but that's $229, just so you know). I am also one of those for whom the setup program was broken, caught in a loop - unlike some of the other commenters, when I reset the tablet I chose \"set up offline\" and the rest of the process went uneventfully. There are places during the rest of the setup where you can add your WiFi and additional emails, and that ran smoothly.PROS:GLORIOUS screen. Very sharp, high definition, fabulous color. No dead pixels, no smearing - just a great screen.There are actually 4 speakers on this thing, and given the small distance between them, it's kind of a joke to describe it as \"stereo\" (It really is, in all honesty; it's just that it's hard to get true separation of the sound when they're less than a foot apart). The sound is slightly tinny but no worries on volume - this tablet can get LOUD. After several no-name tablets whose speakers barely sounded louder than a whisper, loud is GOOD.Battery life is PHENOMENAL - granted, I use it mainly to read on the Kindle app and watch some streaming TV from various providers, but with having prior experience again with no-name tablets whose batteries barely last long enough to watch a movie, this thing just doesn't quit. On standby, not being used - the battery life has kept plenty of juice for over two weeks at a time.I have had zero problems with any app I've installed, beyond that which is due to the physical build of the tablet - for instance, my phone has GPS and compass hardware installed, so with the astronomy app Stellarium, I can move my phone in a circle around me and the app will automatically show me a moving panorama of what constellations the phone is pointing at. The app will run on the tablet but as the tablet does NOT have compass hardware, it won't do the same thing - you manually swipe the screen with your finger. Apart from that, it's happily run everything I've thrown at it. It comes with its own entertainment aggregator app, so if you have multiple streaming services it'll find them and show you things from each all in one app. It does the same for reading sources, too. There is also Google TV installed, which I deleted as it's less fully featured than the app the Lenovo already shipped with - Google TV won't show you Netflix, for example. It came with a trial of Microsoft Office for Android (which I also deleted) and a couple of other small bloatware things but most are easily removed. It's mostly stock android with a few Lenovo tweaks.It's speedy and responsive - a 2GHz octa-core processor, LOTS of storage space, 4 GB of RAM - it boots quickly and I've no complaints about lagging.It should get Android 13 when that goes to wide release, and Lenovo has promised 3 years of updates.Bluetooth works great - paired immediately to my wireless earbuds.It does take SD cards.Out of the box, it comes with a KidsSpace software setup, so you can let the small fry play safely - I'm 63, no kids, didn't need that.CONS:Not many. I'd love it if this had an HDMI port - for the money you'd think it'd be standard since so many lower-end tablets have them - but that's a nitpick.I did mention the sound is a little on the tinny side.This device has already gotten 3 security updates since I've had it, which is good, but the last one took literally a full day to complete. It kept saying it needed to be restarted to complete setup, which I did - three times - and finally, just let it do its thing. Its updating itself did not interfere with my using other apps, such as the aforementioned Kindle - but I've never had a security update hang like that.Does not have phone data capability (not a deal breaker for me) - has no way to use a SIM card.I bought this as a case: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B174TXGD?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1 and it is indeed a perfect fit - the magnetic \"auto wake\" feature works almost too well, in that you'd better fold that last front strip back away from the front of the tablet while using it, otherwise it's liable to turn your screen off/on/off/on....!CONCLUSION:It's pricier than most of the other tablets on the market except those by Samsung and, of course, Apple. But it's not terribly expensive and you do get some really decent hardware for that money - there's a little heft to this tablet, you can FEEL the solid build. It's fast enough, runs smoothly, sips battery juice, and it's really easy for the eyes to look at with its excellent screen. For me, it's well worth the price.",

This updated version is really bad.If you get one with Android 12, disable the automatic updates too.--------------------------I previously had a Lenovo tab M8 from about 4 or 5 years ago, it was an excellent tablet but became slower after the years, I was ready to update to a newer model with double of RAM and this M10 delivers.I use it mostly for web and some video apps and it's very responsive, the sound is better and louder than the M8.Probably the thing I like the best about this one and the M8 is that the screen is much more brighter and with richer colors than the equivalent Samsung tablets, I'm not sure which kind of screen is, I know it's not OLED, but it's much luch better in color depth and brightness than Samsung.You won't regret buying this one, it's an amazing tablet for the money.",

I still have an e-ink Boox Onyx, but it uses Android 6.0 and many apps stopped working and it also became very slow and painful to use.While I prefer e-ink for long reading sessions, with good ambient lighting it is bearable to do so in a tablet. This one is a bit heavy though.It is very snappy and responsive so far, security updates come monthly. I use a matte screen protector so some of the sharpness is lost when watching videos, but they still look fine.",
