It comes with a case and screen protector already applied plus an extra. The color of the tablet and case is beautiful and serene. This has the latest Android 13 operating system. This tablet does seem to run faster and smoother then my last one. The picture quality is very good! The colors are vibrant and picture is clear. I have many streaming apps and lots of games on my tablet (and still so much available space to download much more). Everything looks amazing, loads fast and plays perfectly with no lagging or glitches. The sound quality is great for watching movies and listening to music. Seems enhanced compared to my last tablet. The battery life lasts long. Even after using it to stream shows, play games and waste time on social media it did not need to be charged for a few days. I'm very happy with this tablet and highly recommend it!!",

                "reviewText": "The DMOAO D-11 Tablet is an 11-inch Android 13 that comes with phenomenal customer service and quality. I was initially put off by the fact that it didn't support the exFAT SD Card format, but no other tablet of its size did, either, and I checked a boat load! On the other hand, if you're looking for a quality tablet, it is far and away the best on Amazon.If you check out the other tablets that come with Bluetooth keyboards, you'll see that they come with flat flimsy keyboards you can get from Amazon for $11. The keyboard that comes with the D-11 is a full scale business quality board that can be taken on business trips and will last you the duration of the tablet's life. Of all the tablets I checked out, the DMOAO D-11 keyboard is the best quality tablet of all of them. Am I bummed out that the tablet doesn't support exFAT? Yes. Android 13 supports it, but manufacturers simply aren't featuring it. I hope DMOAO changes its policy in future iterations of this tablet, and if they do, they should announce it on their product page. The only tablet that did feature exFAT (that I saw) was a name brand that was far more expensive and only supported a maximum SD Card size of 256gbs and a 7800mAh battery. I guess when you're a name brand, you can offer less for more.That said, the D-11 has sharp, vivid colors, is suitable for playing games, but it will really fill the niche for business men and women and college (and high school) students. The tablet also comes with a durable case that also serves as a stand to use with its keyboard. The tablet also comes with two-channel stereo and four speakers that work exceptionally well. Another thing, you'll probably want to lose the mouse. It's cheap and light, but it works. I recommend buying a better one, though I simply don't need a mouse that often and the D-11 mouse is more than adequate. If you're into graphics or write long documents, buy a quality Bluetooth mouse.Speaking of keyboards, the GBoard that comes with Android is far better than the one that comes with the Amazon Fire. I've tried numerous other downloadable software keyboards, and the GBoard, though unwieldy at first, learns from your corrections and enables one to save words to a personal dictionary. All in all, I love Android 13 as an operating system.Also, going from a 10-inch screen to an 11-inch doesn't sound like much, but it's a big difference. Don't go with a 10-incher. And when combined with the 2000*1200 pixal screen, yes, you'll see a huge difference. (I considered a Lenova P11 tablet, but it came with a myriad of rules. It insisted in keeping the battery at around 69 percent, and though it's advisable to store lithium batteries long term at 65-70 percent charged, it's not practical on any device you're going to be using day in and day out. Your battery will last much longer if you fully charge it, then use it to 20-25 percent, then charge it to 100 percent again. If you're going to store it, 75 percent is fine. The D-11 has an 8600mAh battery, more capacity than most, but if you turn on Wi-fi and Bluetooth, you'll find the extra battery life welcome.)Bottom line: The D-11 isn't perfect, but for the price, it's damn close. I have an Amazon Fire 10-inch, and when I saw the hi-resolution YouTube videos on the D-11, I was impressed. Finally, the DMOAO customer service is phenomenal, and it goes out of its way to assist users. I've had interactions with other tablet suppliers over the last week or so, and its amazing how little support they offer with their tablets. Of all of them, DMOAO's customer service was by far and away the best. I was surprised.If you're in the market for a tablet, especially if you need a keyboard, the D-11 is a great one to consider. It's not a skinny, flimsy model, so if you need something really light, keep looking; however, the D-11 is light enough for my purposes plus it has that 8600mAh battery. You're also going to need another USB-C cable; the one that comes with the D-11 isn't great. You'll need two lengths, a 3-foot and a 6-foot. You can charge the tablet while using it. (I recommend the AINOPE/JSAUX USB-C 60W cables. They're side-mounted and are very convenient to use.",

                "reviewText": "I've used this tablet for a week and I'm very happy with the quality. The display is crisp, programs open and close quickly and the speakers have good tone and volume. One of the things I like about an android tablet is the ability to customize it vs an apple product. I have downloaded several apps that I use frequently on other devices and they all work fine.To address a couple questions I had but wasn't seeing answers to the tablet does have GPS which works fine and if you have downloaded maps on programs like OnX or Trailforks the GPS will work without wifi connections.The USB-c port can be used for audio out so you can plug in a set of wired headphones or connect it to a digital mixer like a Behringer XR18 using a USB-c to 3.5mm adapter along with a 1/4 jack cable or XLR cable. This allows me to control the mixer from the tablet using wifi and play tracks through the mixer using the USB-c for audio out.The camera is ok but not great but I expected that at this price point. I only took a few photos indoors, it might be better outdoors with more lighting.Overall for the price I think this tablet is very good.",

                "reviewText": "So this is my third review on this product. The first one was positive. The second was negative. This one is again positive.Allow me to explain.When I first received this tablet, it seemed pretty good. The specs are pretty good for the price tag, the screen is bright, and it comes with a case. Not bad.But then it started acting funny: it wouldn't connect to 5GHz wifi without a separate 5GHz SSID (if your SSID had both, it'd always go to 2.4GHz, even with band steering), wifi would turn off when the tablet went to sleep, and it was difficult to get back, etc.So I left a negative review.The seller got in touch with me and promised me that i had just received a defective unit, and none of those issues should be happening. She even said, \"I grabbed one off the shelf right now and tried it myself and I had none of those issues.\"So I took them at their word and tried another one. They were telling the truth. This one is MUCH better.So: the short review is that this tablet is honestly probably the best one available on the Amazon marketplace right now that isn't an $lol brand name.The good:- Big beautiful screen. High res. Responsive.- Included case is a nice touch, and it even auto sleeps the tablet if you close it, and wakes it up if you open it.- Fast- 256G or storage, which is crazy.- 8G RAM. (16G is a marketing gimmick/lie, which I'll get into in the cons.)- 8 core processor. It's fast.- No malware pre-installed (I snooped its traffic on setup), *mostly* lightweight/clean Android with minimal trash. (There is some, but I'll get into that.)- GMS certified, so netflix, pluto, disney+, etc will work.- The housing is metal and feels well constructed and nice.Cons:- Front facing camera is kind of crap (though I don't particularly use/care about that; I really don't wanna look at myself.)- It does not have 16G of RAM. It has 8 and then it has 8G of 'virtual' RAM which it fakes by taking apps you have used least often/cache data, and putting it on your flash storage to free up RAM. This is a marketing gimmick and will actually slow down your device. Whoever decided to start implementing this on Android tablets should ... well someone should have a chat with them, because it's absurd, it's marketing nonsense, and it shouldn't be allowed. 8G is plenty for this tablet. AND YOU CANNOT TURN IT OFF.- No ambient light sensor, and the default brightness on this screen is, SURFACE OF THE SUN. Seriously: turn it down immediately. I bet it'll do wonders for battery life- No Wifi6. Only Wifi5. My speedtests on this device get a pretty consistent 140Mbit in both directions with this tablet. Not terrible, but a far cry from the speeds my wifi6 devices achieve.- The battery life isn't anything to write home about. It's not terrible, and turning down the brightness will help a lot, but it's an octo core 11\" tablet. It's probably as good as it gets.- It's a Mediatek which means it comes with Mediatek's DuraSpeed which is more worthless than a free ticket to a movie starring Dane Cook and Amy Schumer.All in all, this tablet is absolutely worth the price tag and after buying/trying and returning probably a half a dozen of these things, this is an excellent one to settle on.",

I've only had it for a day, so time will tell whether it meets expectations.The screen is bright and clear, with a good size for reading. Font and icon sized can be adjusted. Child safe settings are available for those who need them. Otherwise it has all the features of an android device, and functions as expected.The whole system integrates nicely into the Google universe. In terms of sound, It has 4 speakers, with decent sound.The only quibble so far is that the power and volume buttons are quite small. I have yet to fully test the battery charge life.Update: I've been using the tablet for about a month now. I'm very satisfied with it. Battery life is quite good. It will do all that I want it to. Screen size is so much better than my older Samsung A8. Couldn't be happier with my purchase!",
