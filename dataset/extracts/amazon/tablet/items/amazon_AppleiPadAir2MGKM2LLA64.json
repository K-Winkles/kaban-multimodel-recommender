I bought this one and am blown away, it was incredibly well priced and came completely refurbished, brand new condition with a case and great screen protector. I restored from iCloud and up and running. This was by far the best way to buy a refurbished iPad, with a 90 warranty! Way better then eBay, this is a screaming\u2019 deal and a product you can trust! AAAA+++++",

                "reviewText": "Was unsure about ordering a refurbished iPad particularly as most of the reviews seemed to come from the US and there wasn't anything from the UK. Eventually decided to go for it and am I pleased that I did! It was delivered the following day and I'm delighted. It came in plan packaging and not an Apple branded box (who really cares about that considering this is much cheaper than buying brand new from Apple). The iPad itself is immaculate. Looks brand new , with no marks, scratches or any signs of use. Set up was a breeze and it's working brilliantly. The iPad Air 2 is leap forward from the 3rd generation iPad I had, so definitely worth it. If you're looking for a new iPad I would seriously recommend this route to get one and save yourself GBP130:00, unless of course you're happy to pay that for an Apple branded box, because that is the only difference as far as i can tell.",
