                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Fast & Brilliant Display",
                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace my Amazon Fire HD8 Plus. That is/was a great tablet but my old eyes were finding it more difficult to see the smaller display.I did a lot of research before selecting this Tab 11 Plus. I had considered several of the Samsung tablets but the value and features of this exactly met my needs.I think everyone else has covered all the technical aspects of this tablet already. The action of tablet when switching between screens and apps is snappy fast. The screen brightness can be adjusted so that is super bright for viewing in direct sunlight. I particularly love that when setting up the tablet it will not only sync with your Google account but I was able to pair it with my Samsung phone and automatically copy all of the apps from my phone to the tablet. That saved a lot of manual download time.I did come with a bit of bloatware preinstalled (mostly games) but they were very easy to uninstall. All you have to do is hold your finger on an app that you want to get rid of and when the app window opens just select \"app info\" and if you can get rid of it the \"Uninstall\" option will appear.The tablet definitely has a solid and sturdy feel and is easy to hold.If you want all the deep nuts and bolts reviews on the tablet, then look at some of the other extensive reviews. There are also some excellent YouTube reviews on the tablet. Many make comparisons between the Tab 11 Plus and other comparable tablets.Update 10/31/2022: For a little over a month I have been experiencing an odd pair of things with the tablet. It will randomly restart with no user input. A Google search said to make sure that if it is a case, the enclosure is not touching the power switch. Mine is well clear of the switch and when it is restarting I am not holding it so there is no way there is any pressure on the switch. It will also randomly terminate an app and return to the home page while I am viewing something.Lenovo provides a troubleshooting tree at their support site for this problem and I have done everything, including a couple of factory resets and both problems remain. I haven't been able to identify any user action that would cause these things and they just seem to happen.When I went to the Lenovo site and looked at the items I have registered there it indicated that I still had 635 days remaining on my warranty. When I started chatting with them on the support site they looked up the serial number and it indicated that the tablet had been sold in Poland and they only provided warranty repair service for items sold in the USA. They recommended I go back to the Amazon support site to resolve the issue.I cannot say enough about Amazon support. I used the Chat function and Patrick looked up all of the information and told me it should definitely be covered under the manufacturer's warranty. He then took my phone number so he could call me back once he had personally talked to Lenovo warranty support. After he explained the situation to them, he dialed me in on a conference call and everything was straightened out. Lenovo sent me a FedEx return label for either repair or replacement.BTW, everything else on the tablet is still perfect. The screen quality is excellent as is the sound. Everything about the tablet is zippy fast and a real pleasure to use, other than getting momentarily bumped out or having to re-open an app and try to find where I was when it terminated. That is not always easy depending on the app you are using.UPDATE 11/11/22 I sent the tablet in for warranty repair over a week ago and it is still in processing. The last update I received from the Lenovo repair website was that the tablet repair is on a \"Hold\" and that the damage was not covered under warranty. I can't figure out what they are referring to when they state \"damage\". The tablet is in pristine condition and it is a problem with functionality. It has to be something in the actual Android operating system since nothing is physically broken or damaged and I just experience the occasional restart while using the tablet. I guess we will see what the resolution is.UPDATE 11/20/2022: The damage done to the tablet was during the return shipping. I received a pre-paid FedEx return label from Lenovo. I took it to the local FedEx counter at Walgreen's and they packaged it for me there in a padded envelope that I was skeptical would provide adequate protection. I voiced my concern and was told it would be OK. It arrived at the Lenovo repair center with a cracked screen. Since the FedEx label was generated by Lenovo, I couldn't claim damages with FedEx (my direct claim was denied). I contacted Lenovo and they have been fantastic in handling the situation so far. The repair cost to replace the screen was not much less than purchasing a new tablet which is what I had already done thinking that FedEx would cover the damage. Lenovo customer service wasn't aware that I had already replaced my tablet and after getting the details of how the shipping was handled, offered to send me a replacement tablet before they had even settled with FedEx. I let them know that I already had the new tablet in hand and they said after they reviewed all of my invoices (original purchase and the replacement) along with the photos I had taken of the front and back of the tablet before taking it to FedEx, they would give me a direct payment to my bank. Everyone at Lenovo customer service has been fantastic in the handling of this issue. The tablet itself is great and comparable to or better than higher cost tablets from other manufacturers.",

                "reviewText": "I have both the the Samsung FE with 8g ram and this Levono tablet with 4g of Ram. Both are good but if your an adult spend the extra money and get the FE with the extra 4g of ram plus twice the storage space. The Samsung is bigger, noticeably bigger, much much faster (4g more Ram) and of course the Samsung has an OLED 8K screen Vs this which is not 8k. With that said this IS a nice device and IS worth the money especially if your buying it for a child. It is plenty fast though does lag noticeably during installs of software updates. It does have a beautiful screen and does look really good doing sports , TV shows or games though I only play Clash of Clans on this device. It does have a bunch of pre-installed apps/games for kids which is great if you have children. However if your have teens or your kids are grown like mine there is no way to get rid of these apps as they are part of the system software. Which is very annoying and a waste of space. This device also comes installed with Android 11 and will not work until you go thru the process of updating the system software to Android 12. On the Samsung the system software told me it had to update to 12 plus do 2 other software updates before it ever allowed me to log onto my Google account and begin the setup. This device tried to setup and hung three different times before I did a system reset and fought me the entire time trying to upgrade to Android 12 but once I was able to do that aside from the install lag due to less ram I was able to get the device set up and all my apps set up. I put DirectTV Stream on here and yes I have watched Football and other Live action sports on this device it looks great no lag however this thing is too small to watch TV on regularly. Then again I am spoiled I bought both these devices to replace a 18.4 inch Galaxyview tablet and a 12.6 inch tablet that I watched sports on regularly plus my TV. IF your going to watch sports regularly on multiple devices spend the 1k and get the Samsung 8 which has a 14.6 inch screen. For the money it is a solid buy considering I really just bought this to just stop playing Clash of Clans on my phone (I am 47 and hate squinting at small screens.) If I had younger kids I'd buy this in a second it is super light, inexpensive, the foam case (bought separately on amazon for 20 bucks) seems to offer plenty of protection , and just big enough to do video without ruining someone's eyes but not big enough to be awkward for smaller hands.",

                "reviewText": "I can't comment on how it compares to other similar devices, but with that aside... I really like it! Had it now for over a month. The tablet performs well. I REALLY like Android 12L and the performance mode it has (mirrors a desktop display). I mostly use it for emails, some simple graphic designing, and Google Docs and Meets. Case and keyboard is really great too. Very sturdy. I would definitely recommend this for people looking for an affordable travel computer device. I would not recommend this as your primary device. I have a desktop that I primarily use for a bulk of work tasks.",
