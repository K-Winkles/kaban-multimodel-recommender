The spacious 10-inch screen is easy on the eyes without tiring them like my smaller phone display. Setup took just 10 minutes by swiftly transferring data from my Android phone wirelessly, forgoing the included transfer cable.With 14GB RAM and 128GB ROM, performance is impressively snappy. Face recognition allows me to securely unlock the tablet just by glancing at the camera. The bundled wireless keyboard and mouse fully emulate a laptop experience when connected.I appreciate the thoughtful accessories like a sturdy case, screen protector, and Bluetooth peripherals included for this reasonable price.Faster and lighter than my laptop but larger than my phone, this device hits the sweet spot for productivity and entertainment on-the-go. Crisp visuals and swift responsiveness provide a seamless experience. For those seeking an affordable tablet providing the best of all worlds, this checks all the boxes.",

With 14GB of RAM and 128GB storage (expandable to 1TB), it provides plenty of space and power for all my needs.The tablet's 2.0GHz Octa-Core CPU ensures that it runs smoothly, and the split-screen support is a feature I have found useful for multitasking, allowing me to work on multiple apps simultaneously.Connectivity is solid with both 5G and 2.4G Wi-Fi options, accurate GPS for navigation, and seamless Bluetooth integration. The 8000mAh battery is a lifesaver for long days, and the face unlock feature is not only convenient but also adds an extra layer of security.I appreciate the tablet's elegant gray design, making it suitable for both work and leisure. In my experience, the DMOAO Tablet 10.1 Inch 2 in 1 Android 13 is a versatile and reliable device, offering a great balance of features and performance for my daily tasks.",

It has 128gb of space plus it has a sd card slot.2. It comes with a case, screen film, keyboard and mouse. The charger is guaranteed.3. It has a user manual and it was easy to set up.4. I could retrieve my back up data from my phone to the tablet so that was a plus.5. The speaker is loud and it's even louder with earbuds.6. It has playstore which is great as well.Cons:1. The case is a bit filmsy.2. The front camera is awful at night not sure about days at. The back camera is a bit weird thought.3. I've been using this tablet for over 3 weeks now and when the tablet is at like 15% and I put it to charge it says fully charged in 2 hours. 2 hours passed and it is not even near full. It was at like 70%. Not sure if its a charger issue or a tablet issue though.Overall the tablet is really good so far. At first it was freezing while being set up but that's it. I would recommend it if you are on a budget. I needed it to study for school. Also the keyboard connects with Bluetooth and so does the mouse.",
