                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Best inexpensive Android tablet I've ever used",
                "reviewText": "Wow, Lenovo! You are killing it in the low end product line-up these days. I have an AMD-based Flex 14 and for the money its a great multi-purpose laptop. The Tab M8 continues the pattern of offering a great low-end price for very good value.I have been buying, returning, or reselling the spectrum of tablets for a long time in search of one that checks every box I want in a tablet: Inexpensive, reasonably high quality build, acceptable performance and features.First the huge surprise: The battery life is insanely good compared to just about any other tablet I've used. Screen-on time of roughly 16.5 hours at 50-60% brightness and still 15% battery left after a mix of games, browsing, reading PDFs and watching videos. This is just incredible and easily 2x or more the battery life I'm used to seeing in a cheap tablet. I could take this on a very long day of travelling and be reasonable sure I wouldn't need to top up the charge.The resolution is sufficient, but nothing special at 1280x800. However PDFs and text is very readable and quite clear unless you are pressing it to your face so a higher res isn't really necessary and would just negatively impact battery life for little gain.Performance is surprisingly good for a mediatek CPU. In the past the MTK CPUs I've used in inexpensive tablets have been severely lacking in performance, barely able to smoothly scroll a webpage, let alone play games and such. While this CPU benchmarks on the lower end of the spectrum, it still provides a surprising amount of punch and even fairly intense games are mostly smooth and playable.Warning: For netflix HD users, this tablet lacks the DRM chip needed to watch in HD. You can still watch Netflix, but I believe it tops out at DVD resolution or roughly 540p. Since the screen is only effectively 720p its really not that big of a deal for me.",

                "reviewText": "Considering what I paid for this tablet, it was worth the cost.Buyer Beware however, that while the screen has excellent visuals the overall processor is disgustingly SLOW to respond. Many times I find myself tapping the screen multiple times thinking my first tap wasn't good enough, only to find that when the tablet does F-I-N-A-L-L-Y respond, I'm three levels deeper than I expected to be simply because all those additional taps I made trying to get the table to respond sent me past the page I wanted to be on. It that darn S-L-O-W.Otherwise, it appears to be solid in design, easy to carry and well made over all.Like I said at the start... it's worth the close-out price I paid for it ... but you definitely get what you pay for with this tablet. Honestly, I wish I would have spent the extra money for a Samsung Galaxy tablet because of how insanely slow this tablet is.",

There is no bloatware. The battery lasts several days (no notifications turned on) when not in use and only lost a few percent from full charge in its inaugural run as my pool music player (3-4 hours). It fits neatly in this waterproof case https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KX8TY10/ for use around the pool. The wifi and bluetooth work well even through a couple of walls and over 30 feet.I doubt you'd be able to use this for high-end gaming, but for simple purposes such as mine, it is a nice little tablet at a decent price.",

                "reviewText": "I love my Lenovo tablet! This tablet has a lot going for it. I was looking to replace my Dragon Touch, that only lasted 10 months, and the extra money it cost for this tablet is so worth it. I've also learned my lesson and got an extended warranty. I've just never needed extended warranties with my Kindles since they are such work horses and last a couple of years, at least. My husband uses an old Kindle of my daughters that has got to be at least 5 years old.I am writing this review as a quadriplegic with limited use of my hands. So some of the things I'm going to mention are a particular use for me, but I'm sure are great features for anyone.The screen is clear and bright and doesn't cause eye strain for me. The brightness setting gives me lots of choice on how bright I want the screen. There is a built-in eye protection setting if you want to reduce the blue light coming from your screen. I do not use it because I prefer the brighter screen.The on screen keyboard gives me a lot more options for use than my Dragon Touch did. It is a good size and isn't as overly sensitive as my Dragon Touch keyboard. It gives me a little more time to linger on a letter before it switches to the alternate keys (a verses \u00e3). It also has a predictor pro built in which my last tablet did not have. The microphone setting, so that I can do speech to text, is very good. The keyboard also comes with its own clipboard setting.The speaker is acceptable, but then again, I'm not an audiophile who needs amazing speakers. I do have it hooked up to my Bose Bluetooth speaker, which gives me very nice sound. The speaker works for general web browsing and YouTube viewing.There is plenty of space for all my apps. I haven't even inserted a microSD card, because I still have hordes of space left. It feels fast enough when loading and I haven't noticed any lag time.I love the built-in setting which allows me to wake up my tablet by either double tapping it or raising it up. It's very hard for me to be constantly pushing the power button to wake it up. This feature alone is a big deal for me.I like that there is a indicator light that tells me when my tablet is charging (red, charging - green, charged) which also can be set to flash when I get a notification. Both features can be disabled under the display settings. I would think that the flashing light might be very useful for the seeing impaired.It doesn't take long to charge and holds a charge for a lot longer than my Dragon Touch. I also use a Kindle HD (which I love, but it's obviously not Android) and my cell phone, so I do not use this for really long periods of time. Even with sporadic usage I get two days of use out of it before I have to charge it again. I also don't notice any warmth or heat coming from the battery when I charge it.I'm sure as I get to know my tablet better I will find other settings and options to explore. Overall, I am very happy with my new tablet. Great job Lenovo!",

The Tab will be used for any important travel info that has to be digitized especially any electronic Q&R for a future COVID vaccination history and proof. For the price it has everything you need and a great compact unit.",

Ning\u00fan golpe ni nada.La recomiendo. Estuve prob\u00e1ndola por unas horas y todo bien.Solo recuerden qu\u00e9 tiene 2GB de ram, NO esperen mucho.Es una buena Tablet para hacer Tareas, Video llamadas, Ver pel\u00edculas en Youtube o Netflix. Leer libros, etc.No esperen mucho, No la recomiendo para juegos pesados. Puede Trabarse ya qu\u00e9 2gb de ram no sirven para mucho.Pero si la quieres para trabajar, ver tus redes sociales, ver pel\u00edculas, libros, etc. Entonces esta es tu mejor opci\u00f3n. Precio muy accesible, o si quieres un poco m\u00e1s de pantalla puedes elegir la M10 plus, aunque esta M8 es excelente y su pantalla de 8\" es suficiente por lo menos para mi gusto.La caja te incluye cargador completo, manual y una llave para ingresar tarjeta de memoria.( la mica y la funda no vienen incluidas** yo las compre aparte ) pero tambi\u00e9n son buena opci\u00f3n si quieres tener impecable tu tablet.No tiene fallas, es r\u00e1pida para sus 2gb de ram. Aun no la he probado con muchas aplicaciones abiertas al mismo tiempo pero supongo se va a poner algo lenta ya qu\u00e9 como repet\u00ed 2 de ram no sirven de mucho.Es una tablet econ\u00f3mica, Dise\u00f1o Excelente con acabados agradables marcos no tan grandes como en otras tablet, la c\u00e1mara no es tan buena, si la quieres para fotos o selfies no lo recomiendo ya qu\u00e9 es de baja calidad su c\u00e1mara trasera y frontal.Pero es suficiente para videollamadas.El sonido es aceptable, aunque hubiera preferido qu\u00e9 tuviera dos bocinas para un sonido stereo, solamente tiene 1 altavoz en la parte de arriba.Buen nivel de volumen, pero para ver pel\u00edculas no es tan agradable el sonido ya qu\u00e9 como mencione ser\u00eda mejor si tuviera 2 bocinas para un sonido stereo.Pero nada que unos aud\u00edfonos no puedan solucionar.La calidad de la pantalla es muy buena, tiene buenos colores. La imagen se ve muy bien. Las pel\u00edculas en HD se ven excelente.Creo hice una buena compra, ahora solo falta seguirla probando con el tiempo.Y si la recomiendo.",
