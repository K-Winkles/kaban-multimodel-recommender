But once you get the videos going, it doesn\u2019t seem to slow. Blippi videos seem low quality. But my 2 yr old could careless. Super simple song videos seem good. The volume isn\u2019t awesome. But again. My two yr old doesn\u2019t know. For the price. I think it\u2019s been pretty nice. We don\u2019t let him sit on it all day every day. So it should last a bit. Hopefully nice for car rides! We will see during Christmas haha!",

I then reached out to the seller to see if I could get a replacement because it didn't work, and they said they would send me a replacement. After waiting a month for the replacement and not seeing anything, I reached out to the seller they had still not shipped the product. Once I finally received the product after they shipped it a month after they said they would, the product I received also did not work. Their customer service and products are absolutely terrible. This gets zero stars from me.",
