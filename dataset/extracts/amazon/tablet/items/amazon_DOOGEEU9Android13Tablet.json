I'm just using it for web browsing and playing video and it is pretty darn quick. I think battery life could be better; I turned down the screen brightness and it improved a bit, but it could be better still. Nice that it comes in a clear silicone case and screen protection. I've combined that with a HGWALP notebook-style universal tablet case that doubles as a stand. I'm happy with all of it, which I guess is the most important thing to know.",
