That being said, it does have moments when you turn it on and the screen goes black and displays foreign letters. In my experience i can reset it no problem by inserting a small pin into the tiny reset hole on the side. Frustrating, but for the price it still serves its purpose for my needs.",

I tried the usual corrective steps to bring the tablet back to life \u2013 charged with new charger, pressed reset. Nothing worked. As directed by Amazon, I contacted both the seller and manufacturer via email. It has been 5 days since my request for help \u2013 no reply. Poor quality and terrible customer service.",

Nice and bright on 80% night mode.What I really love is that the power cord plug hole and the earphone plug hole are both on top of the tablet instead of the bottom when you have the screen rotation set to tall instead of wide. I never could understand why phones and tablets have them on the bottom!The only con is that my stylus doesn't work that well with this screen - I have to tap pretty hard - but the touch sensitivity is perfect for the old fashioned finger.I might have to get one for the hubs...",
