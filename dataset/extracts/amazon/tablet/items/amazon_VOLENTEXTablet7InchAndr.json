                "reviewText": "This tablet arrived today (the day before Thanksgiving), and it will be returned on Friday (the day after Thanksgiving). I can't use it. The size is exactly what I was looking for -- larger than a cell phone, but not TOO large. The fact that it comes with a folding cover and appears to even have a screen protector pre-installed is great. BUT ... the operating system is Android Go Edition, which doesn't work like the regular Android operating system. The home screen has an annoyingly busy wallpaper which is impossible to shut off. There are a number of apps pre-installed that cannot be removed or disabled. But the worst is that I bought this tablet specifically to run ONE particular app -- and the crippled version of Playstore that you get with Go Edition doesn't ever allow me to install the app I want to run. In fact, it doesn't even show the app when I search for it by name. Considering that the app runs on cell phones that are older than this tablet and running much older versions of Android, that's inexcusable.This tablet appears to be intended for use by children, not by adults who live in the real world.Very disappointed.Update: My rating has been reduced from 2 stars to 1 star. I replaced this piece of junk with a USED Samsung Tab A6, from 2016, that runs Android version 5.11 -- and that runs the app I needed. Why this much newer tablet, with more RAM and more storage capacity won't allow me to install it is a mystery. It's because the operating system is Android GO Edition, not the real Android 11.Avoid this device like the plague. It won't make you happy.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this Android tablet for my ten year old for our long distance road trip. It really helped us have a calm ride. We started with attaching it to the passenger seat\u2019s headrest to play a movie. The picture quality is great and the internal drive was more than enough to download a few good movies. The audio quality was crisp and clear. Once we the parents didn\u2019t want to listen anymore, he was able to connect his headphones easily. One of the really cool features was the dual camera which allowed him to take photos and conduct a video call simultaneously with his friends. I was glad to see that it came with an extra protective case.We are very happy with this purchase.",
