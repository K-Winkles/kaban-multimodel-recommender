I was bummed but swore I wasn't going to buy another Amazon tablet. So I bought this one instead, I was worried because the price point seemed too good to be true but it's AMAZING! super fast processing, and operates on Android OS. comes with a screen protector and a tough case. Battery life is great! Buy this now!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this tablet for my niece who just turned 4, wanted to get her her own tablet to play on rather than always borrowing mom's.It comes with a lot of apps preinstalled for kids to play with, including a drawing app, videos, educational games and so on. There are parental controls as well which I consider essential and easy to set up, but you can ignore them if you don't care about them. Best of all, it loads up and performs quite fast, which is great for a hyperactive kid who wants to zoom from one activity to the next. It kept up with her taps and clicks just fine, never lagged once. I also think the soft and squishy case is great for kids who are prone to dropping things.Overall an excellent tablet for kids!",

My child only got to play with it once before it reset again and I refuse to set this tablet up for a 4th time.I bought it for around $50 as a Christmas gift. It takes over an hour to fully set up. Which is fine.. if you only have to do it once. Mind you the resets happened in ONE WEEK. I set it up 2 days before Xmas morning. Turned it on Xmas morning after it was wrapped and it was back to set up. So I did it again on Xmas day. Let the boy play then 2 days later I went to give him the tablet after it was completely fine, shut down and put away to charge. It worked just fine when I last touched it. So idk what\u2019s causing the issue.. I just know that this product is a big waste of money.",

Easy for my grandchild to carry around Nice as it has option for a carry strap. Strap wasn't included however. But not a huge cost for the convenience.

Awesome lil product!! The case is perfect for lil accidents it keep it protected very well.l love it !",

Within the iwawa app you have kid profiles and tons of preloaded games but I thought I would be able to log out of the parent profile of the whole tablet. If you can I haven't figured it out yet. Only complaint I have is google wouldn't allow me to make my child an account. I put her name and it told me that it couldn't create one..",
