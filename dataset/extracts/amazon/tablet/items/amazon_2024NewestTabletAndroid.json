It works right out of the box, it easily connects to the internet and loads and works with all apps that I need.On top it comes with accessories, that alone are worth the money. I got the protection case, keyboard, mouse, a USB to USB-C adapter, the sim tray pin, a screen protection film, a stylus pen and a mouse.I tried the keyboard, it connects right away and works fine.The display is extremely bright, it has a bit too much blue while the night mode contains way too much red. Unfortunately I could not find any settings to change the picture settings.It is well build and sturdy, however it is a bit heavy in the hand and it has rather hard corners and edges.I could not ask for more, give the price of only $169.The processor is fast and snappy, the integrated RAM enough to handle the tasks I need it for in a good timely manner. 4 out of 5!",

Both did what I wanted of them: the laptop for doing all my on-line activities and some word processing, and the Fire for reading. But both also had shortcomings: altho the laptop is reasonably lightweight, it is still a hassle for traveling; the Fire I find too small for on-line activities (movies, browsing, even email) and, truth be told, a number of apps I use regularly (e.g., local news and sports) are just not available (or reliable) on the Fire platform. So, this splits the difference perfectly: all the apps I use with my laptop (including some word processing and a better-than-expected keyboard), a large enough and very vivid screen, but also small enough that it easily works a my reader.So far, this seems solid, well-made, holds a long charge, and all the accessories (keyboard, mouse, cover) are first-rate. When you consider the price differential with the Fire (especially if you want to no-ads version) or a laptop, this was spot-on.",

But I have high hopes.Day 2: Still going strong. The mouse they give you comes only with a USB A dongle. But the tablet only has a USB C port. I ended up having to buy a Bluetooth mouse, separately. Still impressed with the tablet.Day 3: Not much use. But still happy with the purchase.Day 4: Had to take my son to the urgent care. It connected to their wifi with no problems. It kept him occupied, but it definitely isn't kid proof. My anxienty was slightly elevated at the thought of him dropping it. Based off the feel of the case, I don't imagine it surviving a fall onto tile floor. But still pleased, since I bought it for a work tablet.Day 5: Took it with me to work today. Handled well. Used it to review PDF documents. Responded quickly. Continued connecting to various wifi routers with no problems. Ordered a 256gb micro sd card to expand storage.Day 6: Micro SD card arrived. Plugged it in. When I formatted it, it asked me whether I should use it for removable storage or expanding internal storage. Told it to use as internal. Now I have 320gb of space. Still working well.Day 7: Full week has gone by. Started using it for school work. No issues connecting to classes. Was able to submit assignment and read texts.After a week of use, I'm still pleased with it. Very little delay or stuttering when switching programs. The battery life is solid. I can make it through a full day with only using about 70% of the battery. For the price, it makes a great companion. The only downside I've seen so far is the mouse they included not having the right connection. Other than that, I'm extremely pleased. It works nearly as well as a name brand tablet. Will definitely buy again, if needed..",

                "reviewText": "Bought it to use in class and navigate my elsevier/evolve account. Good for ebook reading and surfing. My laptop is bulky and not a good travel companion. It is pretty quick and does the job for me. Comes in a sturdy box. Drawback is that I have to use the charger that comes with it. Although other chargers fit, they donot charge up the item for some reason.",
