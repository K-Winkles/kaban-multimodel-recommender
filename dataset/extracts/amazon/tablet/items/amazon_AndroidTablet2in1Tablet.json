It makes it easy to type and navigate better between applications. The tablet runs on the latest Android 13 version, which makes it fast and keeps a charge for long lasting usage. The price is incredibly low considering all the features this tablet has to offer!I love this tablet! And I am incredibly happy that I chose this tablet!RG",

Tried several times, switched off and back on, tried again several times hold the connect button down and keyboard would not turn on/connect or show any signs of life. Tablet turned on, battery was at high level. Reviews were pretty good and price is right (if it worked). Filed out a return and copied shipping label. I need to look further but will not order this one again!",

If you dont mind and only need functionality, its perfect.SummaryPros: functional, useful, perfect for a first tablet, good for small functions like taking notes, reading books, etc.Cons: flimsy keyboard, battery drains fast",

                "reviewText": "I bought this tablet for reading, watching videos and just having something more portable for travel. So far everything is working as advertised and have not had any problems. I did try a couple of games on the tablet and there does seem to be more lag as compared to my Samsung phone, so this is not for gaming if you wanted that, but for just streaming and browsing, I recommend it. I did run the battery down from 100% to 6% and that took about 6 hours, with a couple of hours in standby mode. Note the manufacturer of the tablet I received was ReIndoo which isn't mentioned in the description. The price I paid was the same as advertised for the same device in other stores if you are comparing them. I will update again if it happens to break down in the first year.",

Comes with a wireless mouse too !. Plus one of the coolest cases too. And if that wasn't enough it has a very usable blue tooth detachable mechanical keyboard that fit's on the case while it's holding the tablet up to view the screen. I like to type and this little board isn't to bad. I like listening to music or audio book in bed and I take it to my music studio and use it for music theory and synthesizer / guitar tutorials, can't beat it, under 90 bucks. Haven't had a issue with the battery, good working time and charges quick....... I mean you could almost just ditch your laptop, you really could !!",
