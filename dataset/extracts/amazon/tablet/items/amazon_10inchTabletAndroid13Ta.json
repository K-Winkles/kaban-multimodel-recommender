I only use it to play games, for everything else I use my phone.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very nice tablet. A good blend of current hardware + software at this price point. It is Not slow, Not sluggish. Some things to speed it up (or any aAndroid device), don't enable auto account synh at setup, make sure auto synch off in accounts after set up, turn off play protect in Google play store, select do not auto update apps in Google play store. Comes with USB C cable not the charger. Has 2gb of Ram not 3gb, works at 2.4ghz wi-fi speed. Fast charging, about 2hrs from 0 to 100% charge. Full charge lasts about 4 to 6hrs. Android 12 /12S version loaded, able to load + run all new and old apps. 2gb of Ram, about 1gb always in use other 1gb relatively free to use. That said, don't want to have too many resource hungry apps open all at once: F'book, X, Tik, Netfl etc.. Great for gaming, e mail, movies, you tube, running all types of apps in general. Great gift or to update to newer hardware and latest Android version. Also with this and all Android be sure to clear the Chrome cache (any browser) both within the app as well as the Chrome (your browser) listed within the settings tab. Nice device for price. Enjoy!",

                "reviewText": "I bought this about a month ago and will stick with it for now, but boy this tablet proves you get what you pay for. First, it is beyond slow. My intent in getting this device was to use Evernote to read recipes in the kitchen. I just timed the device and from the time it is booted, it takes over 4 minutes to load a note in Evernote. Fortunately I can account for that and start early.But the other downer for this device is how weak the battery is. The same 4 minutes mentioned about used 9% of the battery, and that's in battery saver mode. I find that if I go 2 days without using this device, the battery will completely drain. Not sure what it's doing in the background, but I should probably monitor the traffic to see what's causing the drain.So if you need a super cheap device that has an easy interface and you're OK using it for non-dynamic apps and keeping it plugged in, this device is for you.",
