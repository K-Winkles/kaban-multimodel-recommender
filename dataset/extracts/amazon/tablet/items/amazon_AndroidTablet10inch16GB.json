With the Android 1\u200b2.0 operating system, 16GB(8+8 Expand)\u200b RAM, and various features, this tablet package offers a lot of versatility and convenience for work, browsing, \u200band watching movies or videos.The WiFi worked as expected, using 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz, but it sometimes seemed slow. You can also use the dual SIM card slots (no SIM card), so you can get access to 4G LTE (which I did not try). I will be using this tablet more for pleasure and traveling instead of taking my laptop when I can. It has an excellent 1280x800 IPS HD display, and a front(5MP) and rear(8MP) camera is a plus for taking videos, photos, selfies, and more! The sound quality was decent, which is exactly what I expected from a small tablet. It says 16.5 hours, but I have not tested the 8000mAh battery life until it needs recharging, but it will depend on the use. \u200bBut it quickly recharges using Type-C. It's not perfect, but overall, this tablet is an excellent option for watching videos, browsing the internet, and taking with you on vacation or work trips. With your purchase, you get the tablet case, charging head, Type-C charging cable, OTG Cable, and the user manual\u200b .\u200bPros:WiFi (5Ghz or 2.4Ghz) and BluetoothSmall and compactCons:Android 1\u200b2.0",

                "reviewText": "This is my second Android tablet ever, my first was a google nexus 7 from a decade ago that served me well. I got this Android tablet as a streaming only screen from bed so no need for heavy computing or file use, and I didn't utilize the sim card for mobile cell connection so no review on that. But for what I needed it for, streaming only, it has worked very well - and given the retail price of it works perfectly for this purpose.Performance of this tablet was fast and snappy to load apps without any lag, videos stream at a very good quality for viewing, it connected to both my 5g and 2.4g wifi networks easily, setup and connection to my google account was a breeze, came fully charged out of the box, with the required cables and a sturdy case with cover which is nice given this tablet is an off brand.",

                "reviewText": "I wasn't sure what to expect with this tablet, but I think it's a pretty decent tablet for the price, and is a pretty solid tablet that doesn't have any bloatware on there or any nonstandard OS environments - it's just a plain Android tablet that came with Google Play store and Android 12 installed. This definitely has a ton of memory and a stronger processor than most tablets out there - but because it's not a brand name, it can come off as a little generic. For some reason, the haptics on this tablet were on by default, so it was constantly vibrating until I eventually changed some of the settings. In a way, it just feels like a gigantic Android phone, which isn't a knock. I like that it has memory card slots so I can expand the storage even more, as well as the option to insert a SIM card for mobile data, I guess. In an era where everyone is locking down their devices so they can't be expanded, that is really nice. I think the only place where you can criticize this tablet is that the screen resolution is a little low for such a large tablet. 1280x800 IPS screen is usually something you might find with a 7\" tablet - and I think other comparable 10\" tablets usually have at least a 1920x1200 screen. The tablet also came with a case included in the package, which is great since you might have trouble finding a case that fits this specific tablet.",

                "reviewText": "Excellent 10 inch Android tablet. The box contained everything needed to get started - power adapter, power cord, protective screen, and case. The initial setup was easy and fast - it only required a gmail account to get started. The tablet is quick and meets the advertised specifications. I'm still getting used to using the operating system as it's different that other tablets I've used, but it connects to WiFi and does everything I need it to do. There is an option to install a SIM card and I have not trued to updated the storage capacity yet. The camera is a little \"jittery\" and it's not the brightest camera, but for taking snapshots of whiteboard data it works great. Battery life so far has been impressive and the speakers have worked fine.",

With the $50 coupon going on right now (making it $90) I will have to buy another one.It is fast, comes with a cover and a screen protector. Had no problem connecting it to my Wi-Fi or using it at all. I am not tech savvy at all but since it is just like my phone I could navigate it immediately.This tablet is awesome!",
