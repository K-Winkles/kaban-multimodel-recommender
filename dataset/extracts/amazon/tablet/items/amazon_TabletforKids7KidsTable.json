I appreciate the strong parental controls that let me approve apps and set limits safely. She spends hours having fun with math, reading, and Spanish apps while improving problem-solving skills. The dual cameras are also a big hit for photos and video calls. Battery life is good for a full day of use. High-quality tablet at a great price for educational entertainment.Strongly recommended!",

He barely had it 2 days and the arm came off. He wasn\u2019t rough with it or anything. Just sat on the couch and played . Doesn\u2019t have a lot loaded and you have to sign up for a google account to load things. But some cute games are on there. There are a lot of games you need to make purchases to go further though also. Not bad for a 3 year old. Just wish the arm hadn\u2019t broke so easily. After reading other reviews I guess this is a common occurrence sadly.",

                "reviewText": "This tablet is okay. It has done a better job in terms of battery life compared to many other tablet which is good. The theme is pretty cute but not exactly a year round kind of tablet but that is more of a preference. I do like the handle design being \"Santa's arms.\" It is pretty sturdy and able to support the weight of the actual tablet. It does come with 64 gb rather than your 32 gb. Because of the arms and santa head, this tablet is bigger than many other 7 inch tablet. The handles are stronger but the specification are still the same as many other kids tablet with only 2 GB. The tablet runs okay but it still runs slow due to the limited resources. Regardless of that, I am still able to use most kids games although it may take time to load. You may experience a lag spike here and there. I also found it sometimes crashes from time to time unfortunately with this device. The size of this tablet is just your standard 7 inches. The actual case/frame makes the tablet look big and as well as heavier. The device is pretty well protected. The Santa color is nice and a cute design but again I would not say this is a year round tablet. The tablet does have a camera and the camera. Honestly these are very low end cameras and not something I would use all the time. You can use the android part of this but it is a very limiting. I would not really browse the web with this. You do need to setup the tablet via android first before setting up the child user interface. Once it is setup, it will always boot up to that and cannot be closed without a password. The screen is not bad and the response is okay. You do notice lag between pages. feels a pretty smooth which means you will get finger prints on it. There is also no screen protector. It also has a buttons are on the front which is interesting and the sound is in the front. The battery life is better than many other kids tablet. I would not say it is the best but it does not drain as fast. It will last at least a full day of use which is good. There is an app that pretty much turns the tablet into a children friendly table. The parents have full control over it down to setting up a password to prevent someone from closing the application. It will automatically boot and open into the application after the initial set up. You NEED to set it up first before this application can be accessed. For the most part, the application is very smooth and works really well. I was actually really impressed with this application. I would say it can be a bit challenging depending on the game or application. I do like that the arms can be turned backward to provide you a more stable stand. The sound quality is okay but definitely not the best. Overall I think this device is better than many other kids tablet but it still bottle neck at the ram. You do get the same control over the tablet as many other kids tablet. I like that the handle is sturdy and provides you a better than any many other kids tablet.. It will run basic applications but nothing that is ram intensive as it only has two GB. This is a 64 gb memory which is an okay upgrade but not exactly needed for a kids tablet. It can also store a few videos if needed. The tablet design has a cute design but again it is not exactly a year round tablet.",
