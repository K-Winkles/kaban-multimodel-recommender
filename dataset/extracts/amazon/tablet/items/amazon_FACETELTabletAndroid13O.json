My goal here was to give my wife some basic computer access when she was traveling but she is now getting her emails and is able to keep up on Facebook, which is a pleasant surprise. The art app that came with the tablet has also got my wife captivated... she can't put it down. Battery holds up well and recharges relatively quickly. My only disappointment is that it didn't come with earbuds. Otherwise, we love it and would thoroughly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I had a Q3 from this manufacturer and it was just slow, always running out of space, memory was always low... I could go on. So I decided to take the plunge and get the Q6 to replace it.The cons are lacking. Battery life is a bit better than the Q3. I can have a good amount of time playing games while waiting for appointments and what have you. But it isn't a really long time between charges. Good thing is it does charge quickly. But let's go to the included case. I got a case on both. They both are flimsy. The first one, I asked for a shockproof case recommendation and they easily gave me one. This one, though, I asked for a recommendation, both before and after purchasing the tablet, and I got that this case should be sufficient. No. It isn't. I'm still trying to figure out a shockproof case that is suitable for this one, as I do not want a universal case that blocks any use of the camera in the rear. That part is what I am severely disappointed with in my purchase. Oh and my last thing... One part says Android 12, but another says Android 13, and on here, it says 13. It's definitely Android 13, though lacking the ability to scramble your pin pad.The pros are simple enough. More speed, more space, different colors, the keyboard addition and the mouse addition is good. That was another selling point for this and it definitely hasn't disappointed.Despite the case issues, I went ahead and gave it a 5 star rating. It's definitely worth the money.",

                "reviewText": "Ok after using the tablet for a short while, here are my impressions:1- rather slow but functional2- the bluetooth keyboard is utterly worthless as is the bluetooth mouse. Too much lag time and only one at a time can be used. It's just a tablet, nothing more. Maybe a wired keyboard or mouse could be added, I don't know.3- the battery is disappointing. About 2 hours of just text entry and browsing is all you can count on.4- there are glitches, faint artifacts in pages of texts.5- despite showing a stylus in the manual and having a spot for a stylus in the tablet itself, there is no included stylus. In fairness there is no mention of a stylus in the Amazon description but in case you are expecting one, nope.In general it is a very fragile, cheaper feeling device but after a day of use I suppose it is about what one might expect for under $100.",
