Everyone in our house had it on their individual phones but sometimes it was a challenge finding a phone when you just wanted to change a light and Alexa wasn't getting which light...or I wanted to see how long on the washer/dryer without hunting down my phone. We bought this as the \"house\" control panel. Assigned it a family email, loaded all the smart apps and it's just perfect. We even got a puppy and now use it like a baby monitor when we need to check on it over a security camera. This tablet is fast, and works beautifully. Amazing for the cost!",

This was actually the third tablet I\u2019ve tried. The other touchscreens were a major issue. It has video cast so that\u2019s a plus. I would definitely recommend as a budget friendly alternative.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted to love this, I was to give 2.5 stars, but there are so many areas of the \"touch\" screen that are unresponsive, it doesn't matter the type of stylus, or even finger touch, except for the disc type, but I worry about that scratching the screen. . As I HAVE had that happen before. Since I have to mainly use a stylus, mesh type refuses to go smoothly across the screen as well. And this is important for what I do. Rubber didn't work, first generation mesh, sort of works for gliding across, but nothing works on the blank spots, (most seem to be near the right side of the screen),. I can touch, rub, or whatever and those spots do not respond. I have tried every fix I find. Cleaned the screen several times and the stylus, I have to move to screen to an area that works, which is not something I can do during the process of some things I work on. It is is very slow to start up. If I am not working, it runs okay, and does whatever else I need, but for the v$$, I was hoping for better performance. As I've had tablets I've worked with that were very basic, low scale, that performed better.",
