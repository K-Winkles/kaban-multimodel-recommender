                "reviewText": "I purchased this tablet to replace my old kindle which was just not working well anymore--mostly for reading and watching when I am on the treadmill, but also for doing art projects and other on-the-go tasks. This tablet is a wonderful bargain. To begin with, It is packaged beautifully and has lots of extras like a really nice case, a bluetooth keyboard and mouse (which is a really nice thing to have when I am doing spreadsheets, etc.) and a charger (which lots of tablets don't come with anymore) It also comes with an extra screen protector. The pure Android meshes perfectly with my pixel phone and other google accounts. Setup is fast, smooth and very easy. Display is lovely and responsive and the battery life so far is really great. For the money, you absolutely cannot beat this deal! (Customer service is also great!)",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Right out o the box this tablet was at nearly full battery charge. The clock was set to the correct time even the correct time zone. It took only ten minutes to set up and connect to all my devices.The tablet comes with 8 GB RAM plus 6 GB of Virtual RAM. In settings, you can see that all 14 GB is available. It has an octa-core CPU and 128 GB of ROM. Most tablets in this price range have 3 or 4 GB of RAM and only 64 or 32 GB of ROM.The tablet connected immediately to the internet and browses very quickly. See the video of how quickly it downloaded from the Play Store the WORD App, installed, and launched it. A simple description is it works as efficiently as a laptop.You can add a micro-SD card of up to 512 GB. Connecting external flash drives through the USB-C jack is the easiest I have ever had with any tablet. Just go to settings, select storage and the tablet recognizes the external drive. All you need to do is select the external drive. Then, from the files app, you can see all available drives.The wireless keyboard has an excellent touch and connects effortlessly through Bluetooth. The wireless mouse works as well as any and connects with the USB-C adapter. The display is high quality and videos play without any glitches. The sound from the two speakers is excellent. MP3s also have excellent quality.You cannot do better than this tablet at this price. You can spend much more and you still won\u2019t get a better tablet. I give it five stars because that\u2019s as high as they allow. It does everything you would want from a tablet and more. Check the videos I have posted to see how quickly and effortlessly it works right out of the box.",

I keep coming back to these guys because the products are affordable and a good quality. This tablet is easy to use and set up. It runs android OS and is very user friendly. Great price for the products you get. I love that this comes with a sturdy case, a mouse and a key board. Perfect for when I am on the go! This makes the perfect gift for family members. My mom is not tech-savvy and she is able to use this easily. The quality of the items are what keep me buying from this company.Highly recommend if you need to get someone a gift. There is even parental controls if your kids use this like mine do.",

As long as you realize you won't be getting any updates to the Android OS and it will eventually become unable to run some apps then it is well worth the price I paid, a little over 100$. I am a 'techie' and usually prefer devices that I can install custom ROMs on, but I couldn't pass up this hardware for this price and I haven't been disappointed. This is perfect for a casual user, which lets face it most tablet users are. I would and have recommended this to friends to and family. I'm not a huge fan of this kind of tech that frankly will end up in a landfill sooner because of the lack of OS updates, but the prices big names like Samsung charge for basically the same hardware are frankly ridiculous.",
