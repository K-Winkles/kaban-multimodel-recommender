                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars The best 8\u201d tablet that doesn\u2019t come from that other $$$ company that starts with an \u201cA\u201d",
                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I spent the past year designing a mounting device that allows small screen tablets and my own 9\u201d IPS screen for PCs called the \u2018Gaming Lens\u2019, but sadly at the start of this quest there was only one tablet that had enough BEEF to handle game streaming and AAA converted titles like \u201cAlien Isolation\u201d and that was from Apple with their iPad Mini 6th generation which will set you back $500 (lowest tier model) push you into their ecosystem, and frankly a 4:3 ratio screen that waste a lot of screen real estate for most 16:9 formatted games. There are a few 8\u201d tablets from Samsung & Lenovo, but they have limited RAM & storage, are slow and on the cheap side as well as only having a 1280x800 screen. Lenovo also makes a 8.8\u201d tablet called the Legion but it was never brought to the US market and it too costs about the $500.Then out of nowhere Alldocube releases not one, but two 8\u201d 1920x1200 IPS screen based tablets. One you can buy for about $80 (with coupon) and this one that you can buy for $160 (with coupon) here on Amazon, and have it next day. The former has 1/2 the memory, and 1/4 the storage of the latter, which is of a slower variant, and much slower processor, but it does share WiFi 5, BT 5 & even 4G LTE (with additional SIM & service) making it an excellent tablet for media/game streaming, and with its 4GB or RAM it can even run \u2018Alien Isolation\u2019 but is a little laggy and stutters on occasion (See my review on Amazon).This tablet has 8GB of RAM, a much faster 256GB storage option, and most important \u2014 it uses the MediaTek Helio G99, which clocks in 2-4 times faster in CPU/GPU tests than their lower cost model. Making, \u2018Alien Isolation\u2019, Half-Life 2, Doom 3 and even the more recent Fortnite run without problems at mostly \u201chigh\u201d settings. Since it actually uses a Google certified copy of Android, I had no problem installing anything there, as well as side loading Fortnite, Alien Isolation, Half-Life 2, Portal and the app that allows you to run the PC version of Doom 3, as well many MODs. As mentioned already it has WIFI 5, BT 5, and a 4G/LTE modem. I popped in my Google Fi DATA SIM, which to my surprise even works pretty well for Game streaming using the XBOX Game Pass, and to lesser quality experience NVIDIA NOW. WiFi 5 is more than adequate to run these services as well, but I would have paid few dollars more to have WiFi 6 to cover all my bases. Still, Wifi 5 on this tablet is no slouch and was never the problem in using cloud gaming services, or local services from NVIDIA, AMD, Steam, or the public domain streaming server \u2014 Sunshine using Moonlight or Steam Link.Another important aspect for me was weight. Coming in at 305g, just a 7g less than the lower cost model and 5g less than the iPad Mini. IT IS PERFECT for my \u2018Gaming Lens\u2019 mount, that allows you to \u201cfloat\u201d it above a Sony DS4, Dualsense or XBOX controller for perfect balance. Since it uses the gamepad you are already familiar with and the fact it can be connected via USB, it makes this ALLDOCUBE tablet a JOY TO USE due to its sharp crisp screen, with it deep blacks & saturated color. Of course at this price you are not getting Variable Refresh Rate, but frankly most Android games can\u2019t even keep up at 60 FPS, which is also your limit with cloud services, and in my opinion a waste on small format device. Speaking of small format devices. By combining my \u2018Gaming Lens\u2019, ALLDOCUBE IPlay 50 and a decent PC, you can save yourself few hundred on those far more expensive small format gaming system like the Steamdeck, ASUS ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go and other variants from lesser known companies where $700 is the price you are going to pay for one of these for the mid to high tier versions. Just add the MoonLight or Steam Link app, a decent WiFi router/access point with your PC connected to it via a LAN cable and you should see decent if not great performance. You can even connect using the \u2018SuperDisplay\u2019 app over USB for \u201ctether\u201d performance, which works quite well using a dual USB cable setup; one for the tablet, and one for the controller. This option works really well for mini PCs like those from MinisForum, that can also be used as tiny screen, push come to shove.In summary, this is almost a perfect 8\u201d tablet: Great price, excellent 1920x1200 screen, loads of RAM & storage, medium/high CPU/Performance (about Snapdragon 640 level), decent WiFi & BT, and BUILT-IN 4G/LTE! Oh and I almost forgot one other feature that sets it apart from its cheaper sibling and other low-cost 8\u201d tablets \u2014 FAST CHARGING! Yep 18W PD Fast, and battery life was also better, but I have not actually done any drain tests yet to determine how long it will last on charge, but I\u2019d say running it all day, today with the apps mentioned above for about 6 hours continuous, it still says I have 36% left. The questions will be. How long will it last? Fit & finish decent. Aluminum body and similar look to the iPad mini 6th gen, just a narrower and tad thicker.Oh there is one thing, I wish they could have done and that is add two speakers, but if I had to choose, between this and a few more gs, I can live without it. Especially since you don\u2019t need any special dongles to plug in a standard pair of headphones. Yep, 1/8th mini jack (and why it is a little thicker than the iPad Mini) available and in the right spot when using it landscape, 2 THUMBS Up just for thinking ahead on that little feature.Note: The launcher used is 3rd party and can be purchased for five bucks in the PlayStore. Look for \u201cConsole Launcher.\u201d Well worth the $4.99.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a new tablet. I\u2019ve been a true-blue Android guy since it was invented, but after hearing so much raving about the greatness of Apple and its tablets I decided to give Apple a try. I popped $850 to buy the latest and greatest iPad Pro. I really thought I\u2019d love it. For sure, the iPad Pro is a quality, well-built product, but I just didn\u2019t much care for iOS to the point that, after two months of disappointing and declining use, I sold it. Also, I found the iPad Pro (with case) to be annoying heavy and clunky - not exactly the portable experience I wanted in a tablet.So, now I still needed a tablet, but, for sure, it wouldn\u2019t be Apple. However, shopping for a decent Android tablet is an eye opener. Manufacturers are simply not interested in the tablet market and it shows. From reading reviews, there are a lot of low-end junk Android tablets out there and a lot of disappointed buyers. (Yes, Samsung make good tablets but they\u2019re very pricey.) I was disillusioned and almost decided to forget about buying a tablet after all when I stumbled upon the ALLDOCUBE iPlay 50 Mini Pro on Amazon. I was impressed with the specs.For the price, you get a lot of bang for the buck. The processor, RAM, memory capacity and standard features on this tablet blew away competing tablets by far. My order was delivered quickly. I can honestly say I enjoy my iPlay 50 Mini Pro much more than the $850 iPad, although I still shake me head when I see the name ALLDOCUBE at boot up. (Note to marketing: Spend more time on a name!)I\u2019m not a gamer, but for my everyday needs, the iPlay 50 Mini Pro is very responsive. The unit is lightweight, but still feels sturdy. The screen is bright and clear. Battery life is excellent \u2013 much better than the iPad Pro.The tablet came with Android 13 installed and it works fine. I\u2019ve had no issues. The setup process simply cloned my apps and data from my Android phone and the tablet was in use immediately. (Note: If you happen to use the Nova Launcher, Nova will exactly duplicate your home screens, icon positions, backgrounds, etc. on your new tablet! Highly recommended over any stock launcher.)Of course, there are a few minor gripes with the iPlay 50. The power and volume buttons are frustratingly too close together and very hard to differentiate. I\u2019m constantly groping and always pressing the wrong one. Also, there is only one speaker and the audio quality is only fair.Bottom line, this tablet has a lot to offer and I\u2019m happy I bought it. I have a great everyday tablet and it didn\u2019t break the bank.",

La batteria dura tranquillamente tutto il giorno usandolo tanto, in ogni caso con un buon caricatore si riesce a portare dal 50 al 100% in un'oretta.La connessione 4G \u00e8 presente e prende sempre bene il segnale, tuttavia (per i pi\u00f9 esperti) non aggrega pi\u00f9 bande in 4G, perci\u00f2 la velocit\u00e0 di connessione \u00e8 piuttosto bassa in zone molto affollate (si naviga comunque benissimo, ma per scaricare file grossi ci potrebbe volere pi\u00f9 tempo)Supporta l'estensione della memoria di sistema con micro SD (fondendo lo spazio e quindi potendoci installare ulteriori app) ma avendo gi\u00e0 256gb conviene usare la micro SD come memoria portatile per eventuali film in modo da non rischiare perdita di dati in caso di rotturaLe patch di sicurezza a quanto pare vengono rilasciate (non scontato quando si tratta di brand emergenti) e ad oggi 11/01/24 sono aggiornate a novembre 2023.Nel complesso ineguagliabile in questa fascia di prezzo, modelli di brand pi\u00f9 conosciuti in questa fascia vendono soltanto porcherie",

No le hice root ni nada raro, todo original.Pros:Es r\u00e1pida y se le puede configurar en cualquier idioma.Android 13 con alg\u00fan tweak para lo de la memoria, todo integrado dentro de la misma ROM oficial.elocidad para juegos de emuladores excelente.Buen material al tacto.La Rom instalada viene de serie con GAPPS(Google applications) es una gran noticia porque te ahorra el tener que instalar todo lo de Google.Contras:Sonido, pffff, deber\u00eda tener 2 altavoces.Notas de mi compra en particular:Una cosa que no me ha gustado es que no estaba sellada y parece como si la hubiesen devuelto y luego me la enviaron a mi como nueva, en fin.Otro punto a destacar que me ha desquiciado es que el cable USB es banco y el cargador negro, esto creo que es un punto en el dise\u00f1o del producto que se deber\u00eda unificar o todo negro o todo blanco, no s\u00e9 a lo mejor soy yo muy exigente .",
