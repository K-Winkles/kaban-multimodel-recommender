Yes, the power button is a bit cheap feeling - so just be careful when using. The only thing that bugs me is because there is no external HDMI port and the seller responded to me saying, \"Yes\" you can get video output by using an adapter.... I assumed that the USB-C port would be compatible w/ one of many of the Displayport\" or equiv. products available on Amazon. I've requested of either seller or another buyer, to plz let me know which video adapter they recommended for this Tablet. So far no response. I don't even know what version USB-C port this Tablet has....would be great to know for choosing the hopeful-above adapter. All-in-all - well worth the $59.",
