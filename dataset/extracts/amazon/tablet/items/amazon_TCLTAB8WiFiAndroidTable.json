                "reviewText": "I bought this TCL Tabmax 10.4 on a special deal to replace a Samsung Tab A7 Lite that was quite slow and was out of storage despite moving as many apps as I could to the SD card. I have had it for a month now and have not been disappointed. I have had great success with TCL products in the past and their value is the best. This Tabmax 10.4 is SO much faster, has double the RAM (6GB) as the Tab A7 and tons of storage (256GB). It works great for light gaming and general productivity. The only cons that I see is that it is delivered with Android 11 (works fine for me) and you must tap the power button to unlock or you can just open the case.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I have a Acer Iconia from 2016 that still works as it should. Wanting to upgrade and doing my shopping homework for a week I chose this tablet for many reasons. Some of the \"reviews\" on here are really a reach from reality. Most of us want a tablet from a company that has been around and with a name that we can pronounce and reliable. TCL for me started with a 55inch 4K with Roku in 2019. I now have 2. Never have had a single issue. This made my decision easier. Yes I have a 4K Samsung so Samsung was in the running. For this price - running 6G Ram, 256G built-in memory, full 10.3 inch screen and a nice folding cover/stand made this TCL my choice. I really don't care if it is Android 11 as I am NOT using this as a computer. I have a real desktop PC from HP with a 32inch monitor 12G Ram, 2TB memory. I hope you are following me. This tablet will be for select games for entertainment while camping etc. Yes I can watch TV easily. Watch the video. This is NOT a $1000 or $2000 tablet! The screen is clear and crisp. If you are buying a tablet for extreme gaming you are shopping for a top high performance desktop PC not a tablet or most laptops. Speakers are great for a tablet and you can add a basic bluetooth speaker for under $50. As a Kindle reader this is excellent. The screen is extremely crisp for easy reading. The google play store has thousands of downloads available. I search and download games for \"finding\" hidden objects and do NOT have to be live online. At our Campground - there is nothing to connect with for now. This tablet is more than fast enough for the everyday consumer. It is a great tablet for this price and surpasses MANY tablets that cost twice as much and more. TCL also has a great website and customer service with real people. Don't forget to register your purchase on their website asap. The video I posted is streaming through Fubo, connected by Spectrum Internet feed, (Animal Planet older episode) connected to my T-P Link Router and the \"show\", and pictures, are from my 2021 Motorola Moto Stylus 5G phone. Look closely for lag, none ! For under $200 with the coupon it was an easy purchase! BTW i don't think this is a tablet for children. It is far to nice. Amazon has many children/entry level tablets to pick from.",

                "reviewText": "I have had many different computers, Chromebooks and tablets over the years. I wasn't really looking for a new tablet but the TCL TabMax tablet sale came up on my newsfeed for $159.00. I reviewed the stats (6 GB RAM and 256 internal storage and expandable storage for another 256 GB and was extremely impressed with the stats to price ratio and thought I would give this a try. I got this just yesterday and have it set up. Very pleased with it. The stock launcher works very well and no need to replace that. I use tablet as a portable media content device. I have spotify on it but I also load a bunch of MP3 music files on there as well in case I don't have internet connection (I listen to these using a pair bluetooth speaker and/or headphones). I read on this using both Kindle and Moon Reader Pro. I have a lot of EPUB and MOBI books that I also store on the device. I have installed various TV Streaming apps that I subscribe to on my regular TV so that I have the option to watch those when not at home. I have various news apps on the device so I can keep up to date with current news.I love the size and the display of this item. TCL's included \"NxtVision\" app lets me make display changes quickly so that either reading, watching video or browsing the internet is comfortable. It has a nice feel and is thinner than other tablets I have had in the past. I'm really glad that I purchased this. It was really an impulse buy but for the price...so very well worth it. It seems fast and speedy enough for what I do on it. Light enough to pack in a bag and take with me on short or extended trips. I just got the device but so impressed with it initially that I really wanted to write this review. If other things come up, positive or negative, I will update this review. If you are looking for a nice tablet and can snag this for a good price...it won't be sorry.",
