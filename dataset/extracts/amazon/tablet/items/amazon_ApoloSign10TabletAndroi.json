The battery life has been wonderful and is lasting a long time. I\u2019m not an original user of Android but the ease of use, how fast it runs, and the clear picture quality while watching movies makes me want to switch things over! I would definitely recommend!",

Pretty easy to set up and get started. Using this mainly for picture editing and making albums. Going to try to do more with it since it\u2019s been so easy to use. ;))For the price, This is a pretty good find!",

                "reviewText": "I gave it four stars only because the sound is really bad. As in, too low to listen to without headphones or a bluetooth speaker. I got it because (A) it was a good price, and (B) to watch a few movies on and read. It's nice for reading. The screen is big enough. Movies and shows look pretty good actually, but I had to download a volume booster app just to be able to listen to them, and those apps destroy the sound quality if turned up too high.Overall, it's not a bad product for the price. I didn't want to spend a ton of money on something just to do a couple things on. It's lightweight. Battery seems to last. The touch is responsive. The image is very nice. Just wish the sound was better. (I haven't tried it with headphones or an external speaker yet.)",

                "reviewText": "I bought this because i got a really good price. Came well packaged. I'm mainly going to use it to watch TV in bed so I don't bother my hubby! It will definitely serve its purpose for that as the picture quality is adequate, not great but certainly watchable.Couple of things to be aware of if you plan on using it for school, work ect... it's pretty heavy, as in, noticeably. The volume is barely adequate and any outside noise makes that almost unacceptable. The volume is improved with earbuds but I don't believe it would be sufficient to use on an airplane as I would like. This might be the deal breaker for me.",

As with most amazon products, I've noticed that they sent crap that doesn't function properly or is otherwise defective. Then conveniently for them its difficult and burdensome to return, making Bezos more unjustified enrichment in the tax-free billions. This is why people hate billionaires. After the initial screen this piece of defective offal froze and became unresponsive. Shocker......... Amazon please do better.",
