Doesn\u2019t have a ton of storage space, but it suits my needs. Battery charges quickly and has decent battery life. You can certainly buy a much higher quality tablet or an iPad, but then again, you\u2019re spending a lot more for those.

                "reviewText": "This review is for the Lenovo Tab M9. I noticed the reviews seem to combine both the M8 and M9. As far as the M9, I purchased the tablet during prime day for $109. For the price, you will not get a better tablet. Sure, Amazon fire tablets sometimes are cheaper, but do not offer full access to the google play store and performance. The M9 offers good performance for the price. Web browsing, and light multitasking with split screen is possible. Also, some light gaming is possible with the right settings. Of course, when compared to an iPad mini 6 (which I own) or a more expensive android tablet, the M9 will be beaten. However, I recommend the M9 if you need an entry level tablet with full access to the google play store. The screen is plenty bright and it has good built quality.As far as the included folio case, the magnets are not very strong, so it does not stay closed. Also the screen protector is plastic and flimsy. I ended up purchasing a glass tempered screen protector and am using the folio case until more are released with better form factors. Skip the M8, which is abysmally slow now and the screen is dim (I owned the third generation M8). Just be aware that the internal storage of the M9 is limited, so if you have a lot of apps, you may use up a lot of storage quick. I use it mainly to stream YouTube, Netflix, etc and web browsing. I\u2019ve also used it to video conference through zoom.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this as an e-reader and for the occasional streaming/light gaming. I use the app ReadEra (not a fan of Kindle) and I couldn't be happier. With the brightness turned to minimal (you don't need much for reading), I get 20+ hours easily. Streaming gets me between 3-6 depending on brightness. The included case is great quality for protection against scratches in your bag, ease of holding, and auto sleep when closed - but in no way is this going to save your tablet from a fall off the table.*This tablet is going to need a couple minutes booting to full speed when powering up. This isn't the case when waking form sleep mode - it's ready to go automatically. But expect some patience when cycling the power.*This tablet should be good for live android updates until at least next year, but runs great out of the box for the basics.*I've also dabbled with some low end retri emulation (GBA, SNES, and even PS1) - all working great especially when connected to power. The bluetooth pairs with a controller no problem.I'd buy this tablet again, especially if its on sale.",

I tried this one out and it was everything I was hoping for\u2026 everything but one major flaw.On the good side it was fast, smooth, great picture quality. It connected fine to all my other devices and it is, in my opinion, the perfect size for a tablet.Unfortunately I did not know that android tablets have started to go the apple route and do not allow you to increase your device storage space. You can mount an SD for extra storage, but not to increase the devices internal storage. This means that you cannot put apps on the SD and with the newer android OS being close to 15gig on it\u2019s own and the files it creates upon starting your storage space is already half gone. That is not sustainable and I\u2019ll be sending it back. It\u2019s very frustrating because aside from that it\u2019s a perfect little tablet for me. Sad day\u2026",
