                "reviewText": "DO NOT BUY THIS TABLET! This product is less than 3 months old and it won't hold a charge. We have used it very little since purchasing it. When powered on, the battery drains fast. We can have it charging all day (8-10 hours) and it still does not reach 100% charge. The case included in purchase causes a barrier to connection for SOME charging cords. We had to remove the protective case - include in purchase - to charge it 2 days ago and the removal separated the front screen panel from the back camera panel which exposed the innards/ motherboard etc. Luckily, the panels snapped back together easily, but during the separations, the buttons (volume & power) fell out of their placement, so the panels had to be reseparated so the buttons could be repositioned. This was a pain in the a$$, to say the least!To sum it up, this is a piece of junk. You get what you pay for, so buyer be ware.",

It takes a very long time to charge as is an issue with it made it 10 times worse the screen is dull. The camera is not as good as they say it is. All in all I feel like I did waste my money because at this point, it\u2019s not very old and I can\u2019t get a voice to stop repeating itself on the tablet and it has been rebooted and it still will not work so I would steer clear of this product for sure.
