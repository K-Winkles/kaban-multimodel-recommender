Or that when I cleaned the screen with a white cotton t-shirt it immediately got swirl marks. It was supposed to be a one-job tablet in a workshop.I did get the app OTG View to work with the camera on this tablet. But it consistently crashed the app after running about 90 seconds. My guess is lack of ram.I would really go with a used galaxy tab or fire tab if you are trying to save money. I ended up returning this and getting the Tab A7 Lite for $50 more which is a much higher quality tablet for the dollar. It has no issues running the app without crashing.I know you are trying to save money with a simple cheap tablet, I was too, but don't waste your time with this one. I wouldn't even subject a 2yo kid to this painful thing.",

                "reviewText": "For this review, I won't talk about how it compares to an Apple iPad or about the Android software vs. iOS. Why? Well, because this costs about a 1/4 of what the cheapest current model iPad costs and that means that compromises have to be made on the hardware to sell it at the price point of under $80. Also, there enough articles and fanboy information on one operating system versus the other. All I will say is that if you are used to iOS and this is your first time using Android, it will take some time to get used to navigating the tablet and setting up/changing settings. It's like being used to a Toyota and getting into a Ford - many of the controls operate slightly differently and located in different places.Okay with that stuff out of the way, this tablet is in the entry level price range and it performs in that range as well. I will clarify my use for this tablet first as I am not using it as my main device. I wanted this mainly to use on my treadmill or rower to watch videos or stream music while working out. That's it. Considering the hardware, booting up took a while. So if you turn off your tablet often, be prepared to patiently wait for it to power up. Launching apps was quick enough but did have noticeable lag if you are used to using a higher price/performing tablet. Also the screen doesn't seem to be as accurate to touch as other tablets too. I would touch an icon and then, when it didn't do anything, touch it again with a firmer and more deliberate press. This can get annoying and make you jab more at the screen.When it came to streaming movies, it did take a second or two to buffer before playing, but once started, it was able to keep up with processing and I haven't received the buffering icon during a video. Other apps like email, calendar, etc. run quicker - probably due to requiring less resources.My review may seem negative, but it shouldn't be taken that way. You get what you pay for and at the price point, this tablet performs well enough. You can't expect it to perform like a current gen iPad at this price. I've tried to lay out some of the main issues so you can decide if this tablet is right for you or if you should spend more money for one with better specs. To me if you are just using it for basic functions, then this is probably going to serve you well while not spending a lot of money.With that in mind, a cold boot of the tablet does take a while, so be patient if you normally turn off your tablet.",

Looks great n picture is good and clear, but I've had this tablet for less than 4months and now it's stuck on the screen you see in the picture I attached. Everytime I cut it on now or try to restart it I get that same symbol or whatever it is. It's charged, I haven't dropped it, and it doesn't have a scratch on it anywhere! But yet it's just not working all of a sudden. Oh and FYI....its response to touch on the screen is Stupid slow! I don't get it but it's a complete waste of $56. Never again. I guess you get what you pay for. I just wish I could have at least gotten 6months to a year out of it da**.",

Android 12 is just too much for the processor. I have and older android tablet with less specs and it works faster and more responsive than this tablet and it has the same problem my other android devices have, and that there is an OS limit once you find it stay with it.This tablet would shine on android 8 and be nice and responsive. If you look at how its advertised it correct, reading, photo viewing, note device and even movie viewing once you get the movie started and don't have to touch anything else; but its slow and not responsive and its all the OS/Processor fault. quad core on android 12 is just not good.A nice Octo core would bring this tablet to legendary status for its price however it's not Octo but Quad. If you adventitious enough to downgrade the OS I would say, go for it, but that is up to you.",
