                "reviewText": "Learn from my experience...your taking a big risk by purchasing an \"Amazon Certified Refurbished\" electronic device. To be fair, i don't know if this product was great or not, as it was a refurbished product certified by Amazon, and when it was delivered it had the wrong AC charging adapter inside. The adapter was labled Samsung, but was definitely for charging something else. So called Amazon Cust. Svc, who were fantastic! They apologized for the inconvenience, and expedited a 2nd refurbished tablet out which I received w/in 24hrs. Other than the box showing some wear, everything looked good. Went & charged the tablet as instructed for 4hrs. Turned it on, and followed instructions on setting up the tablet, per the online user manual. It found my Wi Fi and so I went to type in my security key. This is where things went wrong. The Qwerty keyboard was not recognizing my tap. The directions said tap once lightly... I did and the setup wizards voice said the letter and/or number I was trying to input, however it was not showing up in the security key identification box. I added more pressure, nothing, but the voice kept repeating what I was tapping, I added medium pressure, again nothing. Finally I double tapped it and it worked! But now I'm thinking...are you kidding me, I have to quickly double tap my finger to input my security key, and does this also mean for anything else i have to type in, in the future???? I added the 2nd letter/number of my security key code by double tapping, but it wasn't responding. I tried again, & again, & finally it added a letter/number but not the correct one!! I went to delete it and had difficulty doing that as well for the same reaon. Something was significantly wrong with this keyboard. That was it for me. I had, had enough and called Amazon again telling them that their refurbished product was not refurbished and super disappointed that they would sell an item that they guarenteed was in working order, but truly was not. The customer service rep was very kind and gave me several options of what I could do. I said I wanted a full refund, which they said they would do upon receiving the returned tablet. So folks, don't try to save money and purchase a refurbished product like i tried, because there is a very good chance you're going to get a lemon!!!! Now headed out to Best Buy to buy a new one!",

                "reviewText": "I really enjoy this so far, screen is nice, speakers are loud with good quality, pretty fast, don't do much gaming however. Battery life isn't amazing, but it definitely does fine for me, I always turn it off at night anyway. The only reason it's 4 stars is because sometimes the button pressing is unresponsive so I end up having to press multiple times and then I end up on pages or apps I didn't want to be on, but that might also be because if my fingers, but my Galaxy S5 tracks my fingers just fine so I don't know. Also the side sync works great for my S5, don't really use it too often but it's cool and could be handy later.One thing I was a little skeptical about was if I would be able to read my kindle books on this screen without wearing out my eyes, but the auto-detect for brightness solves it for me, and so far my eyes haven't been strained at all.Overall, this product was perfect for me and what I wanted to use it for, and significantly cheaper than an Apple. Plus my other gadgets are Samsung as well, so I knew what to expect. I would definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "There is NO way these (from Square Deals) are certified refurbished tablets. I have checked the Samsung page and they state that their refurbished tablets are fully tested and put into new boxes, etc. The one I received (like some other reviewers) didn't work correctly right out of the box (see video below). Here's what we had: The box was obviously used with tears on it but that didn't concern us as the the screen looked good, as did the accessories. However, there was a noticeable \"lump\" on the backside near the bottom of the tablet... where most of the tablet was thin, this stood out dramatically. It had no battery charge, so we plugged it for awhile. We turned it on to do the set up and it was in voice mode. It read out loud every item you touched -- though often the wrong thing -- had huge lags in response and was just bizarre. Here is a link to the video we made trying to get this to work.. apologies for the dog barking and my yelling at the dog for barking, but this was so frustrating, I wasn't going to film it again!: https://youtu.be/dK1QIhY5T5wIf you check the Samsung US homepage, you can order certified refurbished products directly from them. The price is lower currently than here on Amazon. I'm sure if you order one that is actually refurbished by Samsung, you'll get a good product, but it's clear that what we received was not certified. http://shop.us.samsung.com/store/samsung/html/pbPage.Refurb_FAQ/ThemeID.38225500UPDATE: We ordered directly from Samsung US. Paid the same price as amazon ($10 cheaper, but had tax). Received the unit in 3 days. It looks and works great. Beware fake sellers on Amazon.",

                "reviewText": "I received the Tablet in excellent condition. However, the device was set up for the hearing impaired and I could not get past the Welcome screen.I took the tablet to an AT&T phone store and they were able to unlock the device. Something I would have never figured out on my own. Please try to insure the unit is set to the appropriate position before sending out. Otherwise the tablet is terrific, very bright and eccellent resolution screen and easy to use. Really glad I took a chance on a certified refurbished product. I have a Samsung Note 3 phone and have been very happy with it.They work almost exactly alike.",
