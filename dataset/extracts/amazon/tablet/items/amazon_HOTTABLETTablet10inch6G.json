                "reviewText": "So I just got this tablet this morning. It\u2019s so beautiful, fast, has good surround sound, I\u2019m deaf in one ear and it\u2019s very loud to me. Like my iPhone 13. good resolution. the only major downside is the screen protector, it sucks, maybe the next buyer will have better luck. I just have bad luck with screen protectors, I can never do it right lol.. when I went to place it on the tablet it went on like a glove but it developed some Bubbles and those bubbles popped when I tried smoothing them out and damaged the protector. then it got dirty and i couldn\u2019t clean it. so I tossed it. but like I said maybe the next buyer will will have better luck. keyboard works, case was already on the tablet when I opened it. It freaked meOut when I went to take the case off to clean the screen, it kinda of pulled the back of the tablet off some But it popped right back on. I guess that\u2019s a good thing in case it needs to be repaired, I mean mostAndroid devices have removable backs And that only means the case is durable enough to do something like that and means it\u2019s not coming off without a good amount of force lol.. just be warned that this tablet is prone to dust, scratches and fingerprints like any other electronic device. I scratched it a little bit fromWiping it down. But that was myFault for using a random shirt lol, so I recommend the protector if you can make it work, or getting someElectronic wipes from the dollar store or something. you can barely tell though,Still looks new and beautiful and it\u2019s still a very good device and has a veryBeautiful professional design! I definitely would Recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap decent tablet. I mean don\u2019t expect expensive high quality like an IPad Pro because its not $1200 its $100 so you get what you pay for, but everyone should know that by now lol. I\u2019m not a materialistic girl but this is the nicest tablet I\u2019ve ever owned. My mom has a Samsung tablet and I wanted one but they are expensive. This is the next best thing to me for a decent price. She actually picked this out for me and I\u2019m very satisfied with it! I just got it today so haven\u2019t played on it much. If anything bad changes I\u2019ll post another review or something but I think it\u2019ll be good! It definitely beats myONN tablet i bought at Walmart witch died on me. for the price and software of this tablet, it gets the job done and you look professional doing it lol. I definitely recommend this to people with hard of hearing as well. It\u2019sGot really good sound and of course you can adjust the audio balance to fit your hearing needs. I know everyone\u2019s hearing is different so I\u2019ll Let you be the judge.Not a sponsored review, actual customer feedback!",

First the voice on the key board don't work at least half the time but the one in the search bar will or sometimes vice Verser. It is set up for google assistant to work with the home page closed , dose not ever. I tried a factory reset and i lost half of the apps that use to be there. Another known problem. The tablet is always dropping the wifi with the latest version and known issue others have had also. Just notation it's supposed to have a good size 6,000 battery does not last, very terrible. I can list other issues but for what? The ram is very slow for 6 gigs very slow and it takes forever to boot. Only letting others know. I'm very sick with very serious health issues and should have known better considering I build high performance computers and operating systems now I'm stuck with this piece of crap. The problem is there's only a little more than it dozzen reviews or so and should have pass this up. Believe me this is what I do and junk.",

                "reviewText": "To clarify, for a cheap, starter tablet for kids, this has the potential to be a great fit! For the (then current price) of $70, coming with a Bluetooth keyboard, stylus, cover, and mouse is a tough bargain to find.The issue Lays in the primary product: the tablet. For a claimed 6gb of ran, the loading speeds and processing capabilities were laughably low, with a two minute boot up time, occasional crashes that turned off the system, and running at one tenth speed compared to other devices when running a wifi speed test. The tablet was used for low-intensity apps, as it's intended purpose was to take notes. Even on a wifi source (running at a good 40mbps - when the system wanted to play nice), there were continual problem with pages being unable to load, app crashes, and internet searches that never popped results. Additionally, the video display ran on a painstaking 40 fps, creating laggy images and slow reaction speeds to inputs. The lack of performance became downright frustrating. If you are looking for a tablet to run fairly basic apps for entertainment, this could be an affordable remedy to your problem. For adults looking for a tablet to up their productivity though, I suggest looking elsewhere.",
