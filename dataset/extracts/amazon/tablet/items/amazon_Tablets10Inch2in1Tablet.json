I have not used the mouse or keyboard, although I would like to try it out. The touch screen works well so I've never felt the need, but if I'm able to update this review I will once I do.It also has a tendency to go off the wifi for a minute and reconnect, but I don't know if that's the tablet or my wifi router because my TV tends to do it too and it's a top of the line TV set. The only real complaint I have is the camera can be blurry at times, and sometimes video is blurry at the start of a video but quickly improves to normal in a minute or so. All apps run fine on it.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a little tablet to use as an e-reader and possibly to read some PDFs on. I quickly realized this thing couldn't even handle Gmail, so my idea of using it to read PDFs went within the first three to five days of having this thing. I've been actually using it for around a month, maybe six weeks (trying to use it) and at this point, I've completely wiped and reloaded everything once, I have only added the Kindle app, I keep it on Do Not Disturb and, unless I'm downloading a book, Airplane mode because it just can't handle anything at all. The battery drains even if I'm not touching it, screen not on, nothing, even with everything shut off as I mentioned. You cannot go activate the battery saver. The only way the battery saver will work is if you go set a schedule for it, you can't just click the battery saver and turn it on. Now, approximately six weeks (if that) into using it, it will say it's charging but the percentage never goes up, at all. I am hoping that once it dies (it probably has already but I got frustrated with it and haven't checked) that issue, at least, might clear up but I don't have much faith. Yes, it's a low price, no, it is NOT even worth that low price.Also, the stand thing does NOT work. It's too flimsy. I could probably tell you other things that are wrong with it but I can't use it long enough without a problem to get to any other problems.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this tablet as a temporary substitute for my old king pad pro which I used for games and art. It runs the art apps I need smoothly so there isn't much issue there other than adds causing it to lag. As far as any games go, it lags pretty bad. The first few rhythm games I downloaded onto it ran alright for a couple days, but after about a week the lag made it nearly unplayable. Now it won't even keep the app open if I try to use the gatcha features, when other tablets are able to do it just fine. So, it's good for a cheep tablet, but definitely not my go to pick.",

She hasn't used the mouse and keyboard yet but it does what she wants. I guess if I had to complain about it it would be smaller storage and not the best camera. But for the price point it's good for sure and checks the boxes.",

                "reviewText": "I recently purchased a 10\" Android tablet and have been very pleased with its performance. The tablet has a beautiful, high-resolution screen that is great for watching videos, playing games, and browsing the web.The tablet is also fast and responsive, thanks to its powerful processor and ample RAM. I've used it for multitasking, running productivity apps, and even light photo and video editing, and it has handled everything smoothly and efficiently.The tablet's battery life is also impressive, lasting several hours with heavy usage and even longer with lighter use. This makes it a great option for on-the-go entertainment and productivity.One thing I appreciate about this tablet is its expandable storage, which allows me to store all of my favorite apps, photos, and videos without worrying about running out of space.The tablet also comes with a range of useful features, such as a front-facing camera for video calls and a built-in GPS for navigation. It's also compatible with a wide range of accessories, such as keyboard cases and stylus pens, which makes it even more versatile.Overall, I highly recommend this 10\" Android tablet to anyone looking for a high-quality, versatile device for entertainment and productivity. Its fast performance, beautiful screen, and expandable storage make it a great investment for anyone in the market for a new tablet.",
