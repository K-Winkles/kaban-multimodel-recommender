The look of the tablet and the size I give it a 9/10 but it freezes real bad and I\u2019m actually in a search for a new one . I do wish I would have saved my money . But I will try to resell on another website .Edit : I returned this tablet to get my money back this tablet literally stopped working completely . First day it was fine , 4 days later loading REAL SLOW. Following week it went dead and it never came back on. We was really careful. Even brought a case for the tablet . She Only used it at night before bed. We kept it in a safe storage place. The tablet was so horrible I wanted to send it back with a cracked screen. I\u2019m over it . Worse thing ever purchased. Save your money on this item . Amazon take this item off the list please",

The color is great, they are easy to operate and I just love the built in stand. I have one in green, purple and silver. The screen is just the right size and not once has this little tablet failed to operate as required. You get what you pay for and I honestly think that I made the right decision purchasing them. Of course there are more powerful devices out there to choose from, so many in face it makes your head spin but if you are looking for an inexpensive, solidly made, price friendly no frills tablet you will find it in this little gem. If I need another I will not hesitate to order the TJD Android 12 Tablet, 10 inch Tablets, 4GB RAM 64GB ROM 512GB Expandable Storage Tablet.",

Its 10.1-inch FHD IPS display offers decent visuals, suitable for everyday use like watching videos or browsing the web.With 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage (expandable up to 512GB with a microSD card), the tablet handles basic tasks well and provides enough space for apps and media files. Android 12 ensures a smooth user experience with access to the Google Play Store for app downloads.The tablet's performance is adequate for everyday tasks like web browsing and light gaming, and its battery life is satisfactory for casual use. However, it falls short in terms of build quality compared to higher-end tablets, and the camera quality is average at best.Overall, the TJD Android 12 Tablet offers good value for its price, with enough features to satisfy basic tablet needs. While it may not excel in every aspect, it's a reliable option for users on a budget.",

                "reviewText": "I wasn't expecting much at this price point, especially with the specs on offer, but I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised. The tablet feels solid and well built. The screen is bright with a reactive touch screen. The fold out stand is excellent and holds the tablet steady without issues. Tablet came with Android 12 with the June 2022 security update (9 months behind at this point).The processor on offer is not the quickest but is sufficient for basic games and multimedia - there is the occasional lag when opening the on screen keyboard but once its open inputting text is smooth. Switching apps can be slow but not enough to be painful. Scrolling across or down can be stuttery. It won't any awards for speed but it is perfectly sufficient for day to day use.The built in speakers are quite tinny and could possibly be quite annoying to use for any length of time - this hasn't bothered the youngster that uses the tablet though. I can't speak for the battery life as yet.It's early days but at this time I rate this tablet and would definitely buy another one.",
