                "reviewText": "First impressions, this is packaged very nicely, complete with all the accessories you would like such as charger, cable, screen protector, etc. I've owned several UMIDIGI products and they all feel solid and well built. This tablet feels good to hold and comes with a clever protective magnetic case with a foldable cover that when shut, automatically activates sleep mode. It also doubles as a stand to prop up for viewing. The 6000 mAh battery lasts a long time...days, on and off in sleep mode about a week with occasional use - pretty much like my Samsung tab... It just goes on and on, and charges quickly with the included charge brick. Wi-Fi is strong and connectivity is quick with no issues, range is excellent also with Bluetooth. The octa-core processor is plenty fast enough for me. Tried light games because that's all I do and it handled them fine. Sound quality is clear and impressive in depth. Data transmission is fast with a Sim installed as well. Calls are strong and the device performs like a more expensive device - I don't detect any difference. The specs are as advertised and the 4-8 GB ram operates smoothly with no glitches. Tried a 1 TB TF as a test and handled it no problem but the built-in 128 GB will be more than adequate for my needs, and is fast. The screen is fine for most things and plenty sharp for me. Great for Netflix. Camera is ok, fine for Zoom and video calls. All in all this is a terrific value and solid performer for the price. Two weeks in and I'm glad I could test this thoroughly enough to know it's a keeper. I must like it because I head for it constantly. The only mods I'd like to see would be a slightly more powerful magnetic catch for the protective flap, and the red and green charging lights are a bit bright for nighttime. Overall I'd definitely recommend this tablet!",

                "reviewText": "I needed a reasonsible priced tablet to replace an aging tablet and the price point on this particular model and associated specifications met the bill. The table feels solid and have good specifications for the price including a bright, hi-def screen, 128gb of fast storage and a more than adequate 4gb of ram (you can expand to 8gb - not sure how to do this yet?). The cameras work well with both a front and rear facing camera. The front facing worked well with zoom and has better video quality than my laptop.I experienced no performance issues with the applications I installed and frequently use and comes pre-installed with Android 13 - a great iteration of the Android operating system.Battery life is good and after 5-6hrs of usage still had battery time remaining.The laptop can be expanded with micro-sd card which can be useful for storing movies, music or books when you are on the road.The features in the book - screen protector (preinstalled), case, charging block and stylus are normally paid extras - so added bonus to have them included as standard in the already cheap price.I didn't try out the 4g sim card compatibility - but this is a rare option at this price point.Overall a great value tablet with good specifications - perfect for everyday usage.",

I have uploaded video and images of this tablet. Overall performance is very fast and even with multiple tabs open while web browsing there is no lags in the web browsing and video streaming on Youtube and other streaming applications it is working fine and there is no lag and video streaming is fast and it does not stop in between. Received this tablet with screen protector already applied and tablet case is also included and case of the tablet is also made with nice materials. It also comes with touch pen. it is with latest Android OS 13 and there is no junk or unnecessary software installed. This tablet is with 128 GB ram and Micro SD card slot with SIM card slot also & 4 GB ram. I have expanded ram option given in the setting and I am not sure whether 8 GB [ 4 GB installed ram + 4 GB expanded ram ] is practically working or not but currently with multiple tabs open while doing web browsing I do not see any lags in the browsing and with multiple tabs it is working smoothly so this 8 GB ram option might be working. Normally when tablet is turned on certain applications are using ram even if I am using those apps and additional -expansion 4 GB ram is working and I am overall satisfied with this tablet and I would recommend this tablet. I have taken outdoor pictures from rear cam and pictures came good.",

                "reviewText": "Title: Solid Performance at a Budget PriceI recently purchased the Umidigi G5 tablet, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations for a budget-friendly device. The tablet's sleek design and lightweight build make it easy to carry around, making it a great companion for both work and leisure.The 10-inch display provides vibrant colors and crisp details, offering an enjoyable viewing experience for movies, games, and productivity tasks. The touch responsiveness is smooth, and I didn't encounter any lag during daily use.The battery life is impressive, lasting through a full day of moderate usage. The fast-charging feature is a welcome addition, ensuring I spend less time tethered to an outlet.While the camera quality won't rival premium smartphones, it's decent for casual photography and video calls. The speakers deliver clear audio, though using headphones enhances the audio experience.The performance is surprisingly robust for the price point. The octa-core processor handles multitasking well, and I haven't experienced any significant slowdowns even with several apps running simultaneously. The 4GB RAM ensures smooth operation for most tasks.The Umidigi G5 runs on the latest Android version, providing access to a vast app ecosystem. The interface is user-friendly, making it suitable for users of all levels of tech proficiency.My only minor gripe is the limited internal storage, but the expandable microSD slot remedies this, allowing for additional storage space for photos, videos, and apps.In conclusion, the Umidigi G5 tablet offers an excellent balance of performance and affordability. If you're in the market for a reliable budget tablet, the G5 is definitely worth considering.",

                "reviewText": "The Umidigi G5 tablet is a good entry level tablet that offers an excellent value at this price point. (around 150 CAD). This tablet is mainly used a substitute for light usage including some videos, sudoku as well as reading documents. This is by no means a gaming tablet or for high intensity tasks.The tablet comes with a small case, cover and screen protector pre-applied that is an extra that is always welcomed.The G5 does very well in all the tasks it is made for.This tablet is excellent to keep a child/ young teen busy during long trips (6+ hours), it has a good battery life, headphone jack, 2 speakers as well as an excellent cellphone band coverage (more on that below) for Canada. It could substitute directly for a cellphone during the trip.The tablet rocks a super clean and minimalistic version of Android 13. Not a single bloatware app can be found. It is capable to having two sim cards or 1 sim card and an SD card. Some excellent combination that could be found easily outside north America. Just those 2 options make this tablet ahead of a lot on the same price.That being said, some corners were cute in some areas. The camera is not that good, the screen colors are very washed out. There are some occasional freezes doing basic tasks. The headphone jack is awkwardly placed at the edge of the corner, volume buttons are not that big and it feels like it is a single button instead of being 2 ( + and -). The automatic brightness is a nightmare, but I am not sure if this an android issue or a G5 issue.The last part is cell phone coverage and speeds. This is both good and bad. As I mentioned, it covers almost all 3G-4G bands available for Bell/Telus. So, cell phone coverage is excellent. The speed in the other hand is not the best. A 4G speed test was done using the tablet offered a max of 5 Mbps, while 3 other devices in the same location minutes apart each gave an average of 75 Mbps.Overall, I give this tablet 3.5 stars. The G5, knows what it needs to do and it does it well, all while being a good choice for budget conscious people.",
