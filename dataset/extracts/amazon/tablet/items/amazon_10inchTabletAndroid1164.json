Yes,but the screen resolution is just low enough that the videos are \"zoomed in\" and it chops off the top of the video (where creators will often include a headline) so it is not the same look as on your phone. But it works!!While it came with its own USB cable for charging, usually any USB type C power cord would charge any device that requires one. But ive noticed this one will not charge with every USB C cord I have, but most of them will.I agree the tablet does not come with a ton of bloatware which is nice. Ive got a handful of my favorite apps installed and still tons of room.The battery life is decent and it tends to charge up pretty fast.You are not going to buy this for the cameras. They are functional, but of low quality.The Bluetooth also occassionally / randomly drops for me while using headphones, but it does reconnect right away so it is tolerable as whatever is in use will pause until it reconnects.I love the nice large screen and Ive installed a different android launcher to completely change the look and feel of the interface. The response time is pretty good as far as launching and using applications.Would I buy another one? Absolutely. This would make a good gift for someone considering a tablet, but maybe not sure how much they'll actually use it. It ihas a nice entry level pricepoint for something like this, too.I've had this tablet for over a week and I use it daily.",

We only need it for school to run one app. Well, this was great for about a month. Now it just never turns on. Sometimes if the moon is aligned right, the tablet will turn on. Its never consistent.",
