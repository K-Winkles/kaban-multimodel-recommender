                "reviewText": "8/23/2023 UPDATE:After a Sun Joe rep offered to refund my purchase (as product is not available and they would not offer a different mower in its place) they now say they will instead give me a Sun Joe in-store credit. Their online store does not have the product(s) I'm looking for. The products they do have would require that I pay 50% more than I paid before for another mower. My frustration with trying to resolve this purchase is not something I would wish on anyone.Another UPDATE:The seller contacted me regarding the problem I was having with getting my tablet to turn on. The seller was very prompt and offered to replace the defective tablet. The tablet arrived yesterday and is working great. THANK YOU BYYBUO!UPDATED: I've upped the star level to two. I did get the tablet to turn on again by using a paperclip and using the reset hole. Unfortunatley I've had to do this a few more times. Sometimes the on/off switch works, sometimes it doesn't. I'm using it daily again but am always uncertain if I can count on it turning on.______________________________________________________________________________________________I loved this tablet when it arrived (for the price I gave ti 5 stars). It came on quickly and served it's purpose as a screen for t.v. and Netflix. However all of those feelings changed today when it failed to turn on. It was fine yesterday. It doesn't even chime now when you plug in the charger (it usually chimes when you plug or unplug the charger).I'm right at the 6 month date. I will seek a replacement.",

It wasn't full of bloatware.Battery life seem okay so far.The speaker isn't very loud and the camera isn't that great, but are usable.It's thin and slick, I'd recommend some case for protection and gripping.When signing into Google, it recognized this as a Tibuta_MasterPad-E100",
