Honestly this tablet made me upset everytime I needed to use it, there would be a major delay everytime I tried to use the tablet. Tablet arrived completely dead, had it on charge for 24 hours and never reached 100% with that being said the charge was horrible. Apps download pretty quick. I returned the tablet for a better one.",
