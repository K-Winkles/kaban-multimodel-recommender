The device runs really fast (atleast much fast ter than me). It is very versatile with it's power/data connector and external micro SD slot. I can connect it direcly to my PC dowloading tons of pictutes or movies or document. Power last for entire day. Checking email, pay bills, shop online and reading books never be easier. with a blue tooth keyboard, I don't feel the need for my laptop for days. Bottom line, you don't really need higher resolution or more RAM and ROM for productive apps. High resolution screen need more powerful processor and memory; and this only needed for games.",

                "reviewText": "I had been searching for a tablet for my mom since Christmas. My original idea was to buy her the 8.4 Samsung Galaxy Tab S since I own the 10.5 Samsung Galaxy Tab S since last year.Well... I bought her a refurbished one from Best Buy and the screen wouldn't show any pictures. I hauled it back to Best Buy and they refunded me my money.Months past and I still kept trying to find a reasonable price for the tab s. I know that I spent a fortune on my tablet and parts of me still regrets it from time to time.No luck. Still more money than I had to spend. My mom then started to tell me to forget it. She didn't want another tablet. The first one I bought her had been a. 80 dollar one that barely lasted two years. A nextbook.So I see this and I see the galaxy tab 3 which I had purchased for my neice earlier in the year. I knew the tab 3 was great for a 6 year old but for my mom I wanted better picture quality and a bigger screen, yet not the biggest.I prayed and hoped it would be everything she needed...and it was. I'm glad I waited and I'm glad she said she didn't mind if it were a hundred bucks or so cheaper than the 8.4 tab s. At times I envy how easily she can hold it and type with her thumbs. I can't do that 10.5 inch tab s!Also, picture quality is better than I expected and speed is really good even before I turned apps off.",
