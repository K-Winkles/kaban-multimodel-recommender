                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great budget tablet for kids",
                "reviewText": "The title states it is an Android 12 tablet, the description says Android 11, and the actual tablet is indeed Android 12. The tablet is thin and light, it doesn't look cheap or low quality, but it is way too light makes you wonder if the tablet is made of pure plastic. It feels much better after putting on the silicon gel protector. I got the feeling the plastic stand in the back of the silicon gel will break soon, but we will see. The charging port is USB-C, which is a big plus. The tablet did not come with a charger, only a USB to USB-C charging cable. It charges fine in the USB port on my extension power strip and the USB charger came with an iPhone or Amazon Fire stick. The battery lasts about 4-5 hours, which is not bad at all.CPU model is indeed SC7731E, but it Quad-Core ARM Cortex A7 runs at 1.3GHz instead of Quad-Core ARM CortexTM A55 MP8 at 1.4GHz stated in the description. Total RAM is 2Gb instead of 3Gb in description and internal storage is indeed 64Gb. Screen size 10.1 1280x800 resolution as stated. GPS functions correctly, Wifi only supports 2.4 GHz and can not detect 5 GHz wifi, which is the major significant downside of this tablet. The download speed for Wi-Fi is about 5.8mbps while my iPhone gets 104mbps when connected to the same router but 5GHz Wi-Fi. Basically, you get what you paid for. The description stated configuration is not realistic in the $50 price range at this moment TBH.Set the specs aside, the performance of this tablet is ok, very ok. I mean you don't feel the responsiveness you get on your iPhone for sure, but you don't feel it is terribly slow either. It will become very slow if you install too many apps or run out of internal storage space, so you need to have a clear definition of what apps you want to keep on this tablet. I keep YouTube, Kindle, PrimeVideo, VLC, Amazon, eBay, Facebook, etc. because I define it as reading and video streaming devices. Light games such as Sudoku, Water Sort, and Plant vs. Zombie work just fine.This tablet came with the app iWawa, which is an educational app for kids. This app makes me wish I had bought this tablet earlier. If you have an Android tablet, check if you can install this app, highly recommended for babies and kids. Sadly it is not available for iPhone or iPad, but now I'm glad I bought this tablet. My original plan is to use this low-end Android tablet as a reading, shopping, and video streaming device while I do my game mission on my iPhone, now I have to do all this on my daughter's iPad Air3.In summary, screw the specs, if you have kids 2-8 years old, and you want a cheap but reasonable quality Android tablet to run iWawa, this one is more than good enough. It also works as a good enough low-end Android tablet as a reading, shopping, YouTube, and video streaming device, whenever your kids are not allowed to use the tablet.",
