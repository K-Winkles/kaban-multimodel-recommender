                "reviewText": "I already own multiple iPads and higher end Android tablets. Why did I end up buying the Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus and give it a 5 star rating?This tablet simply exceeded my expectations.I was in the market for a smaller lighter tablet to read books and manga. As good as my other tablets are, they are not easy to hold for multiple hours of reading. Holding a metal and glass tablet with a 10.6 inch screen gets tiring over a few hours.The screen on this Amazon tablet is more than adequate for reading books from the Kindle app. This is near perfect for manga since the screen size is similar to paper manga. Images and text appear nice and clear.Installing the Google Play store was easy. I need apps like Google Home, Keep, Drive, and GBoard. YouTube works just fine.My use case is rather easy to handle. I let my kids test this tablet. If it can keep up with my kids, then it can handle what I need a tablet for.When I handed this off to my kids, they just went overboard on games. They couldn't find all of the games they play in the Amazon shop store, so I'll be referencing some games from the Google Play store.Roblox is a popular app for my kids. The overall performance was good. It really depends on which game they are playing from Roblox. Piggy ran well. Broken Bones was very jittery but playable. Yeet-a-friend plays well if you disable some of the extra options for the game itself. Cookie Swirl C World is playable, but was not the smoothest. Spray Paint played well. Spider also played well. Random OBEEs splayed well.Here is the pattern I noticed with Roblox. If the game supports a large lobby, then there is a greater chance that the game runs a bit slower. I noticed that the large lobby games are running a bit slow, but my kids didn't care. They were still happily playing and winning without issues.Granny Chapter 1 and 2 play well.Gacha Life and Gacha Club ran well.Among Us ran well.They were playing more games, but I couldn't keep up with their long list.Overall, this tablet can run games well enough. It won't be as smooth as a higher end tablet, but I didn't notice any random crashes. My kids would have definitely complained about it. If you are considering this tablet for your kids to play games, you need to consider which games they are playing.Surprisingly TikTok worked well. When swiping through videos, it may take a second to load before it plays. I don't notice that issue on my other tablets. After the initial pause, the videos play well.Since reading and productivity were my main concern, it's a 5 star tablet for the price. Games are just the icing on the cake. Since I don't play them often it would not have been a concern for me. Now I have another device to hand off to my kids in those just in case situations.",

                "reviewText": "At least if, like me, you use your tablet as your main source for consuming various media such as books, magazines, newspapers, movies, music, podcasts, the Fire HD 8+ is really the perfect tablet for you. I would definitely add that its performance is more than satisfactory for simple tasks like writing emails or drafting documents in general, or if you want to review and comment on PDFs or text documents. The caveat, as with all Fire TV tablets, is of course the limited availability of apps in the Amazon App Store when it comes to productivity, but I have to say that the features of this tablet completely make up for it. The screen quality is absolutely comparable to much more expensive devices on the market, the sound quality even when listening to music is quite impressive for a sub-$100 tablet, the responsiveness of the touchscreen is absolutely acceptable, and the processor speed is excellent for moving image consumption.The limited storage capacity can easily be made up for with a memory card that allows you to add up to 256 GB.The size of the Fire 8 is also perfect for me, it's absolutely enough for good readability, it's also more than enough if I have to write emails, and also very good if I want to watch films or series on the go.",

My fault for only having the 32GB. This newest model has a very clear and crisp screen. It offers great viewing for all the streaming services. Battery life seems to be better. I had no complaints about the previous model. You can easily get 9 to 10 hours of streaming both video and music and browse Amazon, X and watch an hour of You-Tube. The email set-up is very easy. I went with the newer model Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus tablet, because I love the charging stand that is designed for this model. You get a lot of great features at an affordable price.",
