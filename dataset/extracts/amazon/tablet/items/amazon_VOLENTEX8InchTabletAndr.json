                "reviewText": "I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect since every tablet I own and my phone far exceed the specs on this 8-inch tablet. The more I have used it, and played around with it, I find that it has its purpose and I use it on a daily basis. Now it definitely does have some issues. My tablet did not come with a case as listed on the product page and mine appears to already have a screen protector installed on it because there is a piece of dust trapped underneath it. I copied the contents of another Android tablet to this one and to be honest between all the updates and the apps it took hours but once I was done everything was fine. The overall speed is good but not fast. The speakers are OK but not great. The WIFI and Bluetooth about average. It has useable images from both of its cameras. What really surprised me is that this comes with Android 13. Most tablets, even the more expensive ones are using earlier versions of the Android operating system. Every once in a while, the performance lags a little but that is probably because of all the notification and location services that I have running in the background. The fix is probably just to disable some of them. I never fully discharge the battery and my usage is between 4 and 5 hours and it handles it just fine. I study piano and I work at it daily. I replaced my iPad with this tablet because I really wanted a dedicated tablet that could handle a midi interface and this tablet does it and does it well. Having this tablet dedicated just to a single task saves me so much time from doing connections and setup. I\u2019m getting a good solid performance from this tablet at a very budget friendly price. Expectations Met!!!!",

The user interface is fast and very responsive.The screen responds quickly to my touch and there's no lag whatsoever.I really appreciate the audio socket because I prefer wired headphones rather than Bluetooth.Excellent Performance and Very Affordable.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! AAA+++",

                "reviewText": "8\u201d Tablet reviewAs hard as it is to critique a tablet at this price, I\u2019m gonna anyway.PROS:+It\u2019s really inexpensive+Nice sized form factor. At 8\u201d (screen diagonal) it\u2019s almost pocketable.+Quite well made\u2014smooth edges+Quite good screen. The ad says it\u2019s IPS, and I have no reason to doubt it. But see below+Android 13 (!). Most cheap tablets are 12 or even 11.+Setup was easy, if rather slow (about 10 minutes)CONS:-Not much memory (because it\u2019s inexpensive) though you can get more storage simply by putting an SSD card into it.-The screen looks good for simple backgrounds (icons on blue), but does not seem to be HD quality.-Ad says rear camera is 8MP. Doesn\u2019t look like it to me. Picture is grainy and tracks really slowly and badly\u2014when scanning the image blurs and stretches-Front camera is 2MP. Since that\u2019s the one that would be showing my face on a Zoom call, people might think the low resolution is a good thing :-). But it\u2019s not too usable-Performance is slow, really slow.NOTES:I\u2019ve had a couple of these smaller Android tablets, including ones that were intended for kids (which is where I think this belongs) that have worked quite a bit better than this, albeit at a higher price and with a larger screen. I\u2019ve actually been able to use such tablets for adult-level work such as word processing using open source apps. But I fear, not this tablet.SUMMARY:It\u2019s pretty clear that this tablet is aimed at kids playing simple games. It\u2019s not really suitable for much else, frankly, though I do like the 8\u201d form factor; a bit like an underpowered iPad Mini. I might try it with an SSD inserted to see if that will boost performance (unlikely, unless I can get the tablet to use the extra memory for things like screen/camera buffering). Failing that, I might just try to use it as a larger screen for one of my RaspPi setups.It\u2019s ok, and it\u2019s cheap, but it\u2019s not a serious machine for much else given its limitations.",
