                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Checked HW (see HWinfo attached). These do NOT match listed description: CPU is NOT 8x2.0GHz ... shows as 4x1.8 + 4x1.42Rest matches... screen 2000x1200, real RAM: 4Kstorage: 112G avail out of 128GBT5.0, WiFi6, Widevine L1, 13/5MP cameras, 6800mAh battery. Only Accelerometer sensor in this tablet.out-of-box Android 13 (Sep'23 release/no newer update)After week of usage, battery is so so. Reading eBooks (Kindle), light web use (webnovel... no img/video/audio), screen @max brightness & 2 min screen save: Battery gets low by afternoon. Need top off for rest of day. Recharge was slow using included 15W charger (Note: charger emits humning noise when used). Not quite enough for a full day on road use w/o spot recharging.Usage...Initial setup mostly smooth. Screen taps has perceptable delay... just enough to sometimes annoy. Occasionally need to tap again. Think tablet is slightly underpowered. There's a slight pause when paging in browser pages, eBooks, Reddit, Youtube and other apps scrolls.Stable so far (no crashes). No issue/complaints installing apps... didn't feel slow (eg network performance). Running apps stable. My big app test is Kindle (sizable library) which will hang/crash on other lower end phones/tablets trying to do initial and subsequent cloud sync. But once books downloaded started have performance issues. See video.. breaks usability.Screen is bright. 4K Youtube played and looked great. No artifacts/stutter. Audio was good and smooth. Same streaming songs.The power button and USB port are placed opposite end of the table. Wish they were on same as when using in portrait reading mode, accidental press of power button happens. Also wish this supported double screen tap to resume use (vs physical button press only). Some apps didn't carry over from old tablet in Playstore (incompatible due to Google not recognizing this tablet brand/model). Slight incompatibility with Nova Launcher.. the Switch button (furthest right) doesn't work compared with no issues using the default launcher. No headphone jack (which I still prefer vs BT buds). No issues re-using SDCard from old tablet (supports both Internal and Portable format).Included case is minimal and functional. But not sure it'll be durable.Some typo's in Settings. eg. Disalbe vs Disable.So far luke-warm. Seems like if the HW was true 8x2.0GHz that may be just enough to have avoided the sluggish reading and screen response. Between that and the sub-par battery... may return. Maybe the 4GB is not quite enough (Note: Settings shows virtual memory options... but grey'd out) and will need a tablet with 6GB real RAM? Will see after longer use over next week or so.",
