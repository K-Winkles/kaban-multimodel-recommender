It can handle typical gaming, runs both Minecraft and Roblox nicely. Can also handle some more aggressive demand games like Genshin Impact. Good screen color and brightness. So far it seems the idle battery life is kind of short, bring the charger or power bank if you bring it on a long trip. Overall I would absolutely buy this again instead of an iPad or some premium tablet. My kid is very happy. It fit nicely into the generic 10 inch case I bought as well.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. This tablet at 10 inches is the perfect size for viewing pictures and articles on the web. With its high resolution screen and 8 GB of ram it is very responsive . It has128 GB of rom which is enough for all my needs and it can also take a memory card for more storage . The onboard cameras are also good.It is very light and thin so I put it in a case to help protect it. The only complaint I could mention is the speakers are not very high fidelity but if you use it with Bluetooth earbuds or headphones it sounds great. The battery life seems quite good I\u2019ve used it for several hours and it is still at 40%.I would recommend this to anyone needing a good inexpensive table. It has the most features for the least money, and it looks great with the bezels only about 1/2 inch wide.",

The images are not that clear but I just wanted it as a second tablet to type mail. It is ok for that. Once I entered my wi password and the rest of my information all my files were transferred from my iphone to it without my consent. I turned it off a night ago and 24 hours after i tried to use it and a long beep is all I hear, followed by unknown wifi and Chinese letters. I don't want to risk myself keeping something that is giving me a hard time every time i need to rely on it. I think I will better pay for something of better quality",
