                "reviewText": "I recently had the opportunity to explore a range of children's tablets for my grandson Kylin, who loves learning and having fun with technology.After some research, I found a tablet that perfectly fits the bill for kids like Kylin, who are curious and eager to explore the digital world.The tablet we selected not only offers a user-friendly interface but also provides a vast array of educational apps and games in both English and other languages like Spanish and German.This aligns perfectly with my passion for learning and language acquisition. Kylin has been able to pick up basic words in these languages while having a blast playing interactive games.One of the standout features is its durability. Being a child-friendly tablet, it can withstand the occasional drops and spills that are bound to happen. Plus, the parental control options give me peace of mind, knowing that Kylin is safe while navigating the online world.As someone who loves to travel, I appreciate that this tablet can serve as a great companion during long journeys.It keeps Kylin engaged with educational content and entertainment, making those trips more enjoyable for both of us.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased one of these in August for our 3 year old. Likely just luck of the draw, but we didn't experience any problems with wireless connectivity , screen or admin functionality that others have reported. The performance isn't top-level but adequate for a price-point tablet like this. At first the battery life was great - 5 hours or so. Since then, the battery life has slowly degraded to the point where it only has about 2 hours use time. The battery will no longer charge while the unit is up and running. We have to shut it down for the battery to even take a charge. I suspect that it may become unusable in the next 6 months or so. We'll see. I would advise buying the extra protection warranty if offered.UPDATE Feb 2024: Battery life is down to under 30 minutes now. Additionally, the unit absolutely will NOT connect to my phone's hot spot whereas my ancient Samsung Tab 3 has no problem doing so.",

It has a big screen & the case is great with a stand & easy buttons for her to control. It is a bit heavy for her but it\u2019s mostly laying down or standing up. Great buy!!",

                "reviewText": "I have never given a review on an item, but this one I had too. I am totally disappointed in this product I got this tablet as a gift for my son's birthday. And while trying to setup the tablet the screen kept switching to the home screen and would not allow me to go into settings or neither would it let me select wifi. After trying for 15 minutes holding the screen with two fingers hoping I could select it quickly it still switched off I was successful with that method once, but the tablet still would not allow me too setup the screen frozen in settings then went back to the home screen. I will be returning I wanted to see if this was a defect in this tablet, but I read another review and she mention her second one did the same thing. I'm happy for those whose tablet worked. Because I loved the size and what it said it had to offer. If they see this message and send me a working device I would give it another try. This company needs to check all their devices if this keeps having, I have read several people having an issue. I'm sure the company is aware of their defective devices by now I'm just wondering if this is a scam. If I had a choice I would rate this tablet a zero.",
