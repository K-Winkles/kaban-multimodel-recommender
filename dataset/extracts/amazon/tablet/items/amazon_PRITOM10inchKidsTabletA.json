No other regular type C charger would work, which we thought was very strange but we went with it since our child rarely uses it, we thought it would be ok and marked the charger to know which one it is. Fast forward a couple of weeks and now it won't charge it all. It's also not very easy to use, I struggle navigating it and so does my 5 year old. Not user friendly, especially when it's advertised for children!",
