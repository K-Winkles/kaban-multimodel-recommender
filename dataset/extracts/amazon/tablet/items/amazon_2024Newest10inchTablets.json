                "reviewText": "I just received this item yesterday, it was well packaged and the item arrived as promised. This is my first tablet, so I can't really speak about how it stacks up to other tablets. I basically wanted the tablet with the same media features as my phone but with a larger screen. I plan on using it for reading kindle books, shopping, watching movies, accessing social media. For the price, I was not expecting something lightning fast...that is what my laptop and desktop are for if I am looking for speed. Having said that, it seems to be fast, given that is has a decent amount of memory and cpu speed. The keyboard, mouse and stylus work fine. It does not include batteries, but since I only use rechargeable batteries and have plenty of spare AAA batteries for peripherals such as mice and remote controls, this was a non-issue. The mouse uses 2 AAA batteries. I had no issues connecting with my broadband wifi and downloading apps. I haven't had it long enough to speak on the battery life, but so far I am 100% pleased. For new tablet users...I was initially annoyed that it was going to sleep and I had to enter the access code after 1 minute, but the screen sleep time can be changed in the settings, and there is also a setting that it will detect if you are holding it and it will not go to sleep while it is on your person, but you have to turn this feature on.",

As well as they don't keep a charge, internet disables itself, and lastly the tablet will not turn on. Not at all happy with this purchase. Waste of my money. Only getting one star because I have no choice but to give it a star",

And it made it easy for me to transfer everything from my phone and I mean everything. The only thing I didn't transfer are my phone calls and text messaging but I can still do video chats or ya call it Facetime, smdh, it's the same thing people Lol. Anyway if you're looking for something not too expensive and can do almost everything an iPad can do, I recommend this tablet all day. I'm about to order 3 more for the kids so they can have I too.",
