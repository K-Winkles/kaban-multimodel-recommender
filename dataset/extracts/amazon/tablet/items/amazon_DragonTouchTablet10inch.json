Very responsive touchscreen, and runs apps smoothly. I've tried a few games on it, and it works well. It isn't quite up to 2020 flagship performance, but it seems run games similarly to my old LG G6, which is perfectly acceptable for a budget tablet. I even tried COD mobile, and while it would only do \"low\" quality settings, it was fully playable. The screen is clear and bright, and works well with Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, and other streaming video services I've tried. It may not be 1080p, but you could've fooled me. The absolute best feature though is the strength of the Wi-Fi. It is far above every other budget tablet I've ever used, and has never lost connection. The only negative I've found so far is that the cameras are really subpar. The front camera is usable for something like a zoom call, but it's pretty grainy, and needs a lot of light in the room. The rear camera is a little better, but not by much. I would have preferred that they put a higher megapixel camera on the front, even if they excluded the rear camera entirely. Overall though, it exceeded expectations at this price point in every area that matters to me, so I'm really liking it.",

                "reviewText": "I needed to replace a used Nexium a friend gave me when it finally bit the dust. I really wanted an Android as they are more intuitively obvious for me than a Kindle and significantly less expensive that an Apple device.Without a lot of money to spend, I decided to try the Dragon. I've had it for a few months and am absolutely very happy with it. It has everything I want and without the bloat-ware. And for those things I don't want (I don't do games for example) they are easy to be removed.Thus far the battery works great and I don't see any degradation of any sort though it has only been two months. It's large enough for great reading and watching videos yet is not clunky or heavy.It's not so much the average rating but the percent of 1 and 2 reviews. VERY low, and some of which are not about the device. Nicely done Dragon! If someone needs a device I will recommend they look. If I need another I probably won't do much shopping around.",

                "reviewText": "The tablet looks beautiful and sleek with the brushed titanium back panel and minimal camera. The tablet comes with a headphone jack and SIM card slot, which is a great plus when I needed to access my old phone number. The tablet also includes a keyboard slot which makes it a versatile notebook.The tablet's has dual speakers. however, the tablet doesn't have strong bass but the audio quality is beyond my expectations from other tablets I've seen so far.The screen quality is bright with plenty of options of contrasts, such as grayscale for reading, and eye comfort to reduce eye strain. The OS also includes a greatly-designed dark theme. The touch screen is not highly reactive so I don't have to worry about scratches or thumbprint stains.The battery life is comfortably long for general purpose.Overall the tablet is fast and built high quality and would definitely buy it again.",

                "reviewText": "Overall verdict after 1 month of use: Very reasonably priced, with a professional enough look and feel that it doesn't feel like a kids' device, but has a couple flaws that probably were inevitable at this price point.I was looking for an inexpensive tablet as a reading device (while wanting more flexibility than a dedicated ebook reader) and saw this tablet mentioned in a comment on an online article about \"best tablets\" as a suggestion for a gem that was missing from the list. I wanted to avoid Kindle and upon looking this up it seemed to be a very reasonably priced alternative, and got good enough reviews so I decided to go for it.The tablet seems mostly well-constructed. The back is brushed aluminum which isn't necessarily my favorite look (would have preferred either a smooth silver finish or colored aluminum options) but the metal body makes it feel a little more high end and not so plasticky. The charging port is basically my one complaint with the construction, as the USB C port seems kinda... wobbly? The cable can be wiggled around when it's plugged in which makes me a bit nervous to damage the device. This happens with both the cable that came with the tablet as well as a higher end USB C cable I bought previously for a different device, so it is definitely the tablet's fault and not the cable.The screen is fine, I have no idea what the description means by \"2.5D curved screen\" as the screen seems flat to me, but the color/contrast seems fine (and can be lightly adjusted in the system settings) and the touch response is good so no complaints. The 1280x800px resolution does feel kinda low for a 10in device (Kindle Fire 10 has 1080p and even most cellphones nowadays get higher resolution than this on much smaller screens), but this is a very inexpensive tablet so I can't really be too upset.On the software side, the operating system support is a little out of date and the tablet is a little bit laggy on some operations, but nothing unbearable. Android 10 is still popular and development supported and generally fine to use, but at the time I purchased the tablet (February 2021) the operating system was already a year and a half old and a whole major version behind, which might cause some issues in the long run with software support. The device does not seem to support updating to Android 11 and certainly not to the upcoming Android 12.",

I recommended you purchase a glare filtering screen cover to cut down on the reflection from stage lighting, but these are available on Amazon for a good price. The new 64 gig DragonTouch K10 is a great replacement for the 16 gig I bought four years ago. Four times the data storage for only a a few dollars more.",
