So we did!I looked into the trade it in policy and when we found this tablet we knew this was the next purchase. The trade in for the old one was great! we got 20% off the next purchase PLUS a $25 gift card! (which also went towards the new tablet).This is just the upgraded version of the last one. Less of a foamy case and a bigger screen. The buttons and charger and headphone jack are now all on the same side. cute cased to chose from not just solid colors. Once turned on, it looked identical to the previous one. everything was there. Yeah I had to readjust his goals and timer setting and volume settings, but its definitely worth the purchase! Prime day might have better deals on it than middle of January (last one we got was on prime day). But over all review 10/10 recommend! I can even adjust settings virtually with my phone through the amazon kids app! PERFECT!!!",

                "reviewText": "We love our kids fire tablets anyway but the reason we will always repurchase is the warranty. My daughter dropped her tablet perfectly wrong and the screen shattered, which has never happened in the 8 years we\u2019ve used these products. Amazon sent us a shipping label, fixed it, and sent it back within a day or two. A tiny piece of the jack on my son\u2019s headphones broke off IN THE PORT a while back and again, they sent the shipping label and either fixed or replaced very quickly. Electronics for little kids is a difficult feat both with safety and how rough they can be on their items but Amazon does well helping parents navigate those issues.",

But the case is super thin and those of us that have kids know they tend to drop it. I wish there was an option for a warranty. Also, I didn't think it would come before Christmas. It kept getting delayed, took too much time to ship/ deliver.",
