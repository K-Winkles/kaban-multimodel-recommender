They got back to me fairly quick to apologize and offer a refund. Great customer service and happy to leave a good review now!We bought this tablet to use once in a while if our 17 month old gets fussy to watch Ms. Rachel on YouTube and it rarely works. It is the slowest tablet I\u2019ve ever used that we usually end up having to use our cell phones instead. If we do get it to work after waiting forever for YouTube to actually work, it most of the time won\u2019t work for long. My husband and I believe we were sent a defective one because there is no way people would actually give good review on this tablet if it works (or doesn\u2019t work I should say) like ours. At this point I hope the company contacts us from this review or I will just have to find and buy a new product. I wouldn\u2019t even give this 1 star but it wouldn\u2019t let me proceed without at least picking 1 star",

Lol She had previously had a hand me down tablet and surprisingly took very good care of it. So, I decided to \"upgrade\" her. It was a good price and for her age I wasn't looking to spend a fortune on one. The setting up was a bit difficult. It did a lot of initially updates and was slow running right from the beginning. It did come fully charged which was nice and the \"child proof\" case was also a nice addition. After a few times of use I noticed that the tablet was having a hard keeping a charge. I uninstalled some of the programs she would never use and checked for updates. Nothing I seemed to do was helping the charging issue. On top of that It would continually freeze and would have to be completely powered off in order to get it to unfreeze. So, I went through and forced stopped a lot of the background programs. At this point the only program she has on the tablet that is not required in YouTube kids. It also has to remain on the charger in order to stay on. So, all in all I am disappointed in the purchase. I understood that it wasn't going to be the best of the best, but I would have liked for it to have the ability to work properly. At bare min work properly for the first month we had it.",
