The operating system is rather powerful, not the strongest on the market, but you can easily run games like Asphalt, ROBLOX or Minecraft without lagging.The HDD can be expanded to 1TB, which is pretty insane for a handheld device.Amazing cameras, one in 8MP, the other 13MP.Get a case for this bad boy, pronto!",
