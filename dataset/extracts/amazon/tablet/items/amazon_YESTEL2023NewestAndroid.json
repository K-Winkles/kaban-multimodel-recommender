Its basically a mobile phone but in tablet form, I wish I could test the sim part of it but I can't but everything else works, wifi, bluetooth, email, surfing, etc. Then this unit comes with a mouse, a bluetooth keyboard, a stylus, a usb adapter, a case for the tablet, usb cable, charger and ear buds. Wow!I bought this for my mum so she can check her emails easily downstairs but if I didn't already have a system I would have one of these, its really good for what you need. No its not the top tier unit but thats the point you know it isn't and it still performs what you need. Very happy with it.",

                "reviewText": "This tablet is responsive, has a nice display, 6 GB of native RAM memory which can be extended by virtual memory if necessary. It has 128 GB of storage which can be extended by 512 GB if necessary. Battery life is good, not as good as a premium brand like Samsung, but certainly better than other budget tablets I have used. .I do not do heavy gaming and mostly use the tablet for reading books, occasional browsing and limited movie watching. So I don't need to charge more than one a day. I use the included case has a stand and the included Bluetooth keyboard works fine although its smaller size takes some getting used to. I am using a SD card which was recognized right away. In summary, this Yestel tablet provides great value at the price!",

                "reviewText": "Bought these to use for our church praise team choir. So much easier than printing off paper copies of music. The battery doesn't last as long as I would prefer, but all in all its worth the money. I've used these for a couple weeks now. Great little tablet, still drinks power, but for what we are using them for, they are easily charged back up. I just turn off bluetooth and stuff like that when we KNOW we need the battery for longer life. The company had to help me with the warranty, but they seemed very pleasant.",

I hope there is a way for the tablet to continuing receiving software updates over time. It's responsive to touch, loads quickly, and has a good amount of device storage. It also comes with a screen protector and cover. The tablet specifications and accessories make it a great value. Additionally, their customer service team cares about customer satisfaction, and they are very responsive. So far, I am quite happy with my purchase and my expectations have been exceeded.",

I had a few questions which were answered almost immediately by the support team. The keyboard isn't a flimsy plastic and a pleasure to use. I have streamed videos and the resolution was terrific. It played seamlessly. All this and more for a terrific price! I highly recommend it.",

Not sure about the extra 6mb of memory it claims to have, the system itself only recognizes 6mb. It must be shared with the storage. Other than that it's a really nice Tablet. The price was great. It's really fast & it has taken every game I could think of with ease. The only downside with be the case it came with. It's not going to protect it much if it falls. So I would advise getting another one. I have broken my last three from them just falling out of the bed.",

                "reviewText": "I think this is a great tablet. It is an upgrade of one that I received as a gift a few years ago. It was also by the same brand. I really like the ease of setting this up. My apps load up very quickly. I usually use it to play my video games and to surf for vacation plans. I use the mouse quite often as it is easier for me than typing. A few of the pluses for me are the included mouse and keyboard. I also use the earbuds while in public and playing my casino game. It has really vibrant color along with excellent sound quality. I find the protective case to be good as well. What I really like is the ability to use all the ports and camera while it's in the case. As you can see in the photos, all the ports and camera have full accessibility without having to remove the case. I have been using it for about a week now and find I get about 7 hours of use while gaming. I know depending on what it is used for will determine the battery life. I like the blue color of the tablet and case. It's different than the usual boring black or silver colors I have seen. It shows a little personality. I thought it would be good to show a pic of how this arrives fully enclosed in cellophane and how much the tablet and accessories are protected with padding and cardboard. The pricing is really good considering all the extras that come with it. I think any age person would be happy to receive it as a gift and find it so easy to set up and use. It is light in weight and you can also expand its memory. I can recommend it highly. It's really good to know a company will back it's products with a 2 year warranty. Many will only give you 30 days.",
