                "reviewText": "I'm very very pleased with this tablet and it's the best one I've ever had at this point, and I've had several !The sound volume is way better than the others I've had, it is fast to upload and download, the screen is very bright and clear, the front facing camera works very well too . It's exactly what I wanted for my bed side table and remote use at a job site .If your looking for a new tablet this one is a very very good value IMHO and so far I can't say enough good things about it. While inquiring about registering this tablet I was also extremely impressed by this company as they were very very quick to respond to my questions and registering it was simple.It is a rare thing now days to find a company that is this responsive to questions or concerns and this company was fantastic, there customer service is top notch from my limited experience with them ! They literally got back in touch with me in <24 hours to answer my question on registering this tablet,,how great is that ? Good Job !It's everything I was looking for and more, I for one highly recommended this tablet and company !",

                "reviewText": "While I really like theis touchscreen tablet and the optional keyboard, I was disappointed that the mouse that came with it does not work. I tried several batteries but it would never turn on. I doubt I use the mouse that frequently, but it would probably be good to have when using the keyboard. A non-working mouse is not worth the effort to return the product -- especially as I really like the tablet. So far it works well -- just no mouse. Perhaps, one of my old mouses will work with it -- or, if necessary, I could always buy another inexpensive one.",

One feature that I appreciated was that it came with a utility that allowed me to transfer all my data and settings from my old tablet. I had not seen this before and it saved me a lot of time and effort in setting it up. It also supported 5gb wireless so it is very good with streaming applications. Customer service is knowledgeable and responsive. I highly recommend this tablet as a good value for money.",

                "reviewText": "Gave my daughter my old android 11 tablet I am usually very particular about what brand I use, but I'd thought I try something priced lower. When I received and tried this tablet I was pleasantly surprised, it's fast and works well. Love the accessories, the keyboard and mouse connects instantly when Bluetooth is on. The touch screen works great, I added a screen protector for added protection. The case was really stiff at first but loosened up after a few uses I like the color of it.Packaging was great, very well packaged.Been using this tablet for almost 2 months, I watch YouTube videos and play games on it with no issues, no lags no force closings. Nothing bad I can say about it, it just functions great, plus I love that I can add extra storage. For the price and the accessories it\u2019s a great deal, buy it and buy it now, enjoy.",

                "reviewText": "First off, it all runs on Google, which, as a PC technician I can tell you Chrome is SOLELY designed for big businesses that use server towers, so please stop making it your go-to for home use as it overheats and destroys your electronics by running the CPU hot. Also, be sure to disable the spellcheck in your keyboard options or Chrome will crash every time a word is misspelled and you poke anywhere near it. Trying to type and edit text online is virtually impossible until that is disabled.Secondly, managing photos is almost all locked by subscription fees or glued to cloud saving (where they get copies of your images if you read Google ToS. You give them the right to own and use anything on cloud). Everything i do on my old Samsung phone for free is blocked by subscriptions. Editing, adding cover photos to folders, grouping folders... No organizing anywhere because it just places the folders and not even alphabetically; just wherever it feels. A lot of issues more with the Google Photos it uses, but I am not here to review that crappy app this tablet runs on so I'll move on.Other stuff I hate about this tablet:SD Card is INSANELY difficult to insert or remove. Needed a toothpick I made a flat bar on one side of like a branding iron to push it in. Taking it out I almost broke it.Crappy clock on lock screen you cannot change the style of (Numbers are in a weird 4-digit 2x2 rectangle). Case cracked about 2 days into owning it and I wasn't rough with it. It doesn't leave my bedroom. Also, the foldable stand part of the case does not support the weight as it has no way to clip in place, so the tablet just falls over. Probably how it broke, come to think of it.When I first got the tablet I tried moving my files from my phone to it using the suggested prebuilt-in system. It wouldn't recognize my phone was connected and my phone tried to receive rather than send files.The mouse that comes with this tablet I would expect to protect a Kinder Egg because the plastic is so thin and poorly made. It won't last long.Good luck trying to organize or manage anything on this tablet as it is all a mess of a UI. Has been taking me days to learn how to do simple things like rename folders or disable unwanted features (some of which, like the Read Aloud option cannot be disabled).No biometric lock, by the way. Not a big deal to me but if anyone is curious.",
