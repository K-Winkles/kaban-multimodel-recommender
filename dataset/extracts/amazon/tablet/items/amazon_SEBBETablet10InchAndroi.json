                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars I almost never have to deal with annoying app crashes and a frozen tablet",
                "reviewText": "So, my tablet included a few basic items. I found two screen protectors, one of them already installed, so I didn't have to waste time applying the screen protector myself. Next, I got a slim charger and a USB charging cable, both in black. The included case has a bright blue cover and a transparent back. It fits like a glove and works to protect the tablet from scratches or minor falls. Lastly, the manual was ok but it dealt mostly with Android OS setup and settings, which I, as a long time Android user, didn't need. The only thing I could use from the manual are the support contact details maybe.I charged the tablet and it took barely ten minutes until the battery was 100% full. I guess it was already charged before shipping. I turned it on and I could connect it to my Wi-Fi 5 network to start the initial setup. After around seven minutes, I landed on the home screen with a colorful wallpaper. There a six apps and a Google apps folder. I swiped up to take a look at all apps. I counted just 27 apps, no bloat except for Hulu, Netflix and the Kids Space app. I could completely remove Hulu and Netflix but not the Kids Space app because it's a Google app.One thing I miss is that the tablet wont turn off the screen automatically when I cover it with the included case\u2019s lid. I still have to the press the power button.According to SD Maid, a utility app that lists specs, cleans and does many more system related tasks, the tablet's CPU architecture is arm64-v8a, which makes it possible for me to install the majority of apps.The back camera provides a detailed image. The front facing camera is less detailed but I think its acceptable for Skype and other video calling apps. There's no lagging and I can zoom in and out as well.There are two speakers and the sound is loud and clear in stereo. I found out by watching a left-right speaker test video on YouTube that the speakers have to be top in order to have them in right orientation. The volume is also loud enough so I can listen from a distance.The screen is 1280x800 pixels and its multi-touch. It registers up to 5 touches at once. And there's an eye comfort mode that reduces blue light. Auto-rotation works instantly.The tablet doesn\u2019t struggle with my productivity tasks. I could use it with Collabora office writing documents and editing spreadsheets. YouTube is responsive and I can view videos in high definition. I could do light video editing without any issues. Most important to me is social media and messaging due to my large family living all over. I can use the latest version of Facebook, Messenger, Whatsapp, Signal, TikTok, X, Line etc.As I also get many pics and vids from friends and family, I inserted a large 128 GB SD card for more storage. It took little time to format the card as portable storage.I don't have any interest in gaming and so I haven\u2019t played any game on it. I can\u2019t tell if it can handle any graphically demanding games.By the way, I connected my RGB keyboard without number pad to my tablet and it recognized it instantly. A notification popped up asking me if I want to turn off the virtual keyboard while the physical keyboard is plugged in. I tapped on yes. I can use many shortcuts with my RGB keyboard like Alt + Tab to switch apps.I have been using it for over a month. As far as I can remember, the tablet only froze once when I was editing a larger video. It never has done so while doing other tasks. The same goes for app crashes. It\u2019s such a relief to know I almost never have to deal with annoying app crashes and a frozen tablet.",

Worked pretty well for the price up until the fall. In anticipation I tried to find something that would act as better protection but noting fits correctly.

                "reviewText": "The very pretty package concealed what turned out to be a pretty lousy tablet, even at the price.Setting up the tablet and transferring my data from my phone it took three tries, but, hey, I thought, nothing's perfect. Then I noticed that I only actually had 1.2 GB of RAM available of the advertised GB, even when only system processes were running. That's ridiculous, and it actually forced me to decide which app I really wanted to have open. Then I noticed that the touch screen tended to not be very responsive. Typing became an absolute pain in the rear, but using speech to text is just as bad, because it usually takes three or four tries before it properly initializes.The only game I really play is Marvel SNAP, which has nice vector art comic book graphics...except on this tablet, where even the text shows up with jaggies. Almost every app causes the tablet to stutter and hang about every 5 minutes, which gets annoying when you're actually trying to accomplish anything.Several key apps, such as Gmail, G-board, and Messages come with bizarre mandatory deviations from what I'm used to on my Pixel. Some setting options, such as preventing the home screen from rotating when auto-rotate is on for apps, are simply missing.Most alarmingly, as long as the screen is on, the battery slowly and constantly drains, even when it's plugged in to charge. Yes, it drains more slowly when it's plugged in then when it's not, but I'm really not impressed with the battery life and I can't imagine how somebody managed to keep this from dying for 10 days.It's ridiculous that the mouse included requires a USBC to USBA adapter because the manufacturers didn't think to include the proper port for the mouse chosen for inclusion. Using a dongle on a slim tablet is already going to be a pain, but now you have to use an adapter and a USBA dongle thanks to poor planning. The case is adequate, though it leaves a little something to be desired when it comes to folding it into a stand, but the biggest oversight is that there's no storage for the keyboard. Really, it seems like somebody just picked a bunch of cheap products tossed together and sell as this great deal that I am returning on Monday.Oh, and as for the excellent customer service people keep mentioning... If you really read through the five stars use, you'll notice that a lot of them mentioned being compensated in exchange for changing their review to five stars. Trying to contact the company in Amazon's app just leads you to Amazon's customer service, please try to instruct you to contact the company through the app and finally realize the problem. I contacted them via email and received no response, which makes sense in light of the revelation that this company has virtually zero presents on the internet. They do not have a website, there's no proof that they exist in any form other than some guy in a garage somewhere, and it seems silly to expect a company that doesn't even have a website to adequately take care of customer service and warranty needs.Honestly, the only good thing about this dumpster fire is that nobody reasonable is going to charge me a restocking fee for returning a crap tablet and buying something better.",
