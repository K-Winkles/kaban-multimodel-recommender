Well we ended up sending the others from the other company back and buying 3 more of these devices. So far they seem to be exactly as described, work really well, built well, have a lot of different capabilities our previous devices did not have (previously used Samsungs) and so far we've used them for movies, reading, YouTube, creations, gaming and no issues yet. So far really happy with these devices and brand! Would recommend giving them a chance!Great specs for the price & well packaged, so far amazing customer service & 2 yr warranty coverage applied.",

Realmente, es de 8gb y puede ampliarse hasta 8gb mas.-En la caja viene todo lo que puedes necesitar como funda, protector de pantalla , cable, cargador, pinchito para abrir la bandeja contenedora de la microSD y l\u00e1piz \u00f3ptico para navegar.Contra:-La resoluci\u00f3n de pantalla es buena pero no me gusta que hasta puedo usar las u\u00f1as para poder seleccionar algo. Parece tecnolog\u00eda de hace varios a\u00f1os cuando empezaron las primeras pantallas t\u00e1ctiles en ese aspecto.-Sistema operativo muy b\u00e1sico. Si eres una persona que le gusta la personalizaci\u00f3n y funcionalidades, se queda corto.-No funciona el brillo autom\u00e1tico. Ni el modo noche se puede programar para que se apague y encienda autom\u00e1ticamente.-El l\u00e1piz \u00f3ptico solo te permite navegar y seleccionar, no se puede escribir con el.",

                "reviewText": "After returning several non working tablets (one arrived from China with a broken screen) and the others were second user devices which turned out to have major software problems so they also had to be returned. I finally decided to change tactics and go for somthing new and nearer the state of the art. I ordered the Blackview Pro 7 10inch Android tablet. It arrived from Amazon within a couple of days and I was immediately impressed by the quality of it's constuction. The screen is a very good high resolution device, it has 10 Gig of ram and is probably the fastest tablet I have ever used! It is also very easy to set up, although it would have been nice to include the type C to type C cable needed to transfer data from an Android mobile in the box as few people would own one. In short this device is exemplary and I cannot recommend it too highly. The price of about \u00a3130.00 seems to be a bargain for this level quality and performance. Only one minor problem - Android 12 seems to have done away with the arrow which takes you back a screen or closes a programme. The modern way is apparently all operated by dragging a finger across the screen. This is very troublesome to an old timer like myself but I expect I will get used to it! In short, amazingly good construction quality and performance at a very reasonable price. My advice - this must be one of the best buys available on the market and no - I have no connection with Blackview.",

I decided to buy one for my daughter, bad idea...As soon as we turned it on we realised text to speech was activated, odd considering this wasn't the case with the one my partner bought. The touch screen was barely responding to input, making it almost impossible to get through setup. After finally adding my daughter's account I had to fight a barely functioning touchscreen to even move through the menus. I have removed my daughter's account after more relentless touchscreen issues and severe lag and turned the tablet off. I have also requested a refund and will return the tablet. Hopefully this rubbish will not be sold to some other poor unsuspecting soul. My daughter was heartbroken on Christmas day because of this so huge thanks for that. Will not use this company again.UPDATE: The same issue is now affecting the tablet bought for my son. Severe lag and unresponsive touchscreen rendering the tablet practically unusable. Will be getting returned along with my daughter's.I have read other reviews that this company has not fully refunded other customers with issues like this. If this happens then I will be contacting trading standards.",
