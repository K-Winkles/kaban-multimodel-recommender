                "reviewText": "I use this (Teclast T60) as a mobile gym of sorts, participating in online streaming fitness classes, and usually outdoors.Everything works like it's supposed to, even when multitasking, with no buggy surprises. The launcher overlay dock and navigation bar are always present at the bottom of the screen. Since the screen size has so much room, it enhances the navigation experience. At the operating system, everything looks legit, with basically no bloatware. The device hardware (memory, CPU, GPU, etc.) matches what is advertised.This is unlike a tablet that I had purchased (and returned) from a different vendor a few weeks prior to this. That tablet's Android version was \"borrowed\" from another Android device using different hardware, and was a glitchy mess that misadvertised core count, misadvertised the GPU, and who knows what other surprises. This was not the case at all with this Teclast tablet.I haven't run any synthetic benchmarks, but more importantly, I was able to video stream a Zoom call the other day, while tethered to a 4G phone, in a windy outdoor park for an hour in low light. Not a single hang up or glitch during the call, with bluetooth connected to earbuds, and a keyboard, and occasionally using other apps at the same time. And that was a day or two after receiving the tablet, and on the original charge. The call consumed perhaps 10-15% of the battery. This convinced me the tablet was a keeper!Pros:- Battery life good- Screen brightness is good enough- The quad speakers sound better than I expected- Comes with screen protector installed- Bright red Lenovo-style main side key button is easy to spot in low light- Costs around half the price of similar sized/specced tablets of well-known brandsCons:- This 12\" tablet is a non-mainstream size, so less accessories to choose from at the moment- Was not aware that it comes with a screen protector installed (had to cancel the one I ordered)Unknown:- Game/3D graphics performance- SIM card functionality- Photo and video quality (good enough for me and gets the job done)",

                "reviewText": "I normally buy Apple, but wanted a cheap \"throw around\" tablet and decided to try Android/Teclast a while back. 3 tablets later I still keep buying these Teclast tablets - maybe I have a problem. I gift my old ones away and people love them. I have had the M40 Pro, T40S, and now the T60.If you want the larger screen, this is probably their best one yet. I was about to order this model and import it, as I have been looking for it in the states for a while, then it (finally) arrived on Amazon. It was a few dollars more on Amazon, but you have easy returns and 2 day shipping. Still worth the price after the promotional coupon.Construction - 9/10. Really clean design - nice edges, slim design, feels solid, and lightweight. Lock button is textured and red which is nice being so close to volume buttons. USB-C charge port is on the bottom now. Back just has a cheap sticker for the model information, but that can be removed easily.Audio - 8/10. Probably the best audio yet in a Teclast tablet, you can actually use this at low volumes - previous models even on low volumes were quite loud. If you do crank it up, it gets pretty loud with decent bass for speakers this small. Nice it has four speakers, two on both sides.Display - 8/10. It's a really crisp large screen, but I dinged it a couple points because of a couple minor issues. 1) It's not very bright, if you plan to use this outdoors much you might have issues - it's fine inside. 2) Streaming (YouTube, etc.) the color tones just seem \"off\" to me, especially with skin tones. It's hard to describe, I thought initially it was a contrast setting but can't seem to completely fix it - people look almost washed out in videos. You don't really see it otherwise, and the effect is more noticeable depending on the amount of light in the scene. It's not a deal breaker, just odd, and I wonder if it's a result of the super high-res screen. 3) I can't seem to stream from my media server reliably anything over 1080P and ~20Mbps to the device. Which is fine (1080P on a 12\" screen is plenty!), but was confused at first as I couldn't get videos to play until I forced it to downgrade the quality. Will test this more.Cameras - 6/10. It's nothing spectacular, and not very good in low light. But more then enough for a video call or quick pics.OS - It's Android 13, and if you like Android should be at home. Has a few nice features and benefits over 12. Also nice Teclast doesn't install any bloat-ware, and it did get an OS update over Wifi after setup. Not being a huge fan of Android, I install a different launcher and highly customize it. I was happy to see Nova Launch worked great on 13.Storage - It's HUGE! 8GB Memory (plus 8GB of slower expanded memory), and 256MB for your storage needs (still not sure why teclast calls it ROM memory). And if you need more storage, you can easily expand it with a micro SD card. It seems common in the Android/Tablet market to list the total memory as 16GB when it's really 8GB fast main memory + 8GB slower expansion memory. Even though it's only 8GB of fast memory I've had many things open at once with plenty of room to spare. You may need to enable the expansion memory in your settings.Performance - It's FAST! This thing is snappy, faster then any tablet I have purchased from them. I don't game much so can't comment on that, but think it should be fine with most titles. But web browsing and jumping between apps is instant response and a good experience.Battery - So far this seems reasonable, but still hope it improves after a few charge cycles. The faster CPU and large screen does come at a cost for power usage, but the big battery helps mitigate that some. AccuBattery (doesn't have much history yet) is saying 11 hours continuous, and 30 hours of time under normal \"mixed\" operating conditions.Cellular/SIM - Not tested, but it does support a SIM card and cellular data if you wanted to use that feature.What's in the BOX?! - Not much really. I was hoping for at least the (normally free) bundled flip case, but no luck. They did include an already applied free screen protector, so that's a win. Other then that, you get a USB-C cable and US power brick. Hopefully more accessories turn up on Amazon, as of right now if you want a case or better screen protector you'll need to import them.Sorry for the long review, hope it's helpful.",
