                "reviewText": "A very good starter tablet. The reason I went with this instead of other tablet within price range was due to the small 8 inch display. For me, up to 8 inch is the tablet size that can be held with one hand instead of two, making it a perfect tablet to scroll with one hand and hold with another.Only issue I have came across is that because of the modem, it is rather sluggish. It needs a bit more power for speedy web surfing, which may mean that it may not be the best for games needing a rapid connection.",

                "reviewText": "Well to start off the tablet in general is very slow so I started to investigate why as it should be smoother than this with the specs it has, for one it does not have 6gb of memory, it's virtual 3gb which is not actually functional according to cpu-z, it shows 2.9gb of available total ram,Performance isn't horrible but don't expect to do much more than surf the Internet and even that is rough, i mainly got this to use my canon camera for astrophotography and I hope it will function well enough for that but it's disappointing for a company to say it has something when it doesn't it's very misleading,The screen is decent for the price and the build quality is solid but the ram issue is enough for me to give it a lower review I really wanted this tablet to be good but unfortunately it's not",

                "reviewText": "For the size and price point this is a really good android tablet. Right out of the box I put to work streaming a movie on it and had no issues with battery life, after 2 hours of a movie at nearly full brightness the battery was down to 40 percent from 80 percent when I started. Right out the box the setup was easy and screen very responsive. The built in speaker isn\u2019t the loudest I\u2019ve experienced but tablet has Bluetooth and headphone output so that good. WiFi range is really good on this tablet, picked up my home WiFi outside my house really good compared to my phone that has trouble detecting it, so that was big a surprise. Works really well on internet browsing and loads YouTube really quick. Great all around small tablet, it\u2019s thicker than expected but the thickness makes it easier to hold. Definitely recommend this for entry level tablets for kids or just a good simple tablet for internet and YouTube browsing.",

                "reviewText": "The UMIDIGI A15 tablet is a budget-friendly device that boasts impressive specifications. It features a 11\u2019\" FHD+ display with 2000 x 1200 resolution, powered by an Octa-Core processor. The tablet runs on Android 13 and comes with 8+8GB RAM and 256GB storage, expandable up to 1TB via a microSD card slot. With a 7500mAh battery, it promises long hours of usage. It also has a dual camera setup with a 13MP main camera with flash and a 8MP front camera.Now, let's delve into the user experience this tablet offers.Straight out of the box, the UMIDIGI A15 arrives fully charged and ready for use. It comes bundled with a screen protector, a case, and a stylus pen, which are all valuable additions.The case is sturdy, offering protection with bumpers on all four corners. The tablet's audio quality stands out with its four speakers providing clear sound. The screen is bright and of good quality, making it suitable for various tasks.Storage space is abundant, thanks to the available microSD card slot that supports up to 1TB. Battery life is satisfactory, offering around five hours of continuous usage. It supports fast charging and comes with a type-C USB port. The inclusion of an audio jack for headphones is a nice touch for those who prefer private listening.The camera quality is decent considering the tablet's price point, delivering satisfactory photos and videos. As well as an AI face unlock feature to wake the screen.However, there are a few areas where the tablet could improve. It lacks a fingerprint reader, which some users might miss for quick access and added security. The absence of a double-tap-to-wake feature means you have to press the power button whenever the screen turns off.The tablet came preinstalled with google play and three third-party apps: Huion Note, HiPaint, and a Chinese elephant icon app. While these can be uninstalled, their initial presence might be bothersome for some users. Also, folding the cover behind the tablet causes the screen to turn off, necessitating a press of the power button to wake it up. Lastly, the screen protector slot doesn't seem to fit properly as it does not align accurately with the camera.In conclusion, despite a few minor drawbacks, the UMIDIGI A15 tablet offers excellent value for its price. Its robust features and thoughtful additions make it a strong contender in the budget tablet market.",

                "reviewText": "Needed a new tablet and decided on the Umidigi A15. I've been a fan of Umidigi products for years and check out their lineup whenever I need a new electronic device. I didn't need a top of the line tablet as I don't use it for gaming, have a console for that. I do alot of research and require a device that is portable, with a good size clear display, that can handle dozens of open tabs and good battery life. The ability to add a SIM card is a plus for true mobility. The A15 works perfectly for my needs. I was pleased the it came with a protective case.I was disappointed that there is no headphone jack and the FM radio app that comes pre installed requires headphones to act as the antenna.I appreciate the stock android with only 3 extra apps added and I only uninstalled one of them.To sum everything up, a good tablet for the money, nice display, good battery life and good performance for the price point.",

                "reviewText": "This is my second Umidigi tablet. I have the G5 Tab, and was pleasantly surprised with it, so I figured I should try the upgraded \"gaming\" A15. I've been using it for about 8 days, here are my thoughts...In the box is the usual Umidigi accessories. They included the charging cable, brick, SIM tray pin, and stylus. The tablet comes with a pre-installed screen protector as well as a folio case. Popped in and SIM and data worked right from the start. No configuring, which makes me happy. I'm with Virgin Mobile, can confirm it works on Bell/Virgin.First thing I noticed was the vibrant and better resolution screen. The whites just pop. I feel almost as if the whites are too white, and the rest of the colours, while good, seem a bit darker. Doesn't affect my use yet, as I haven't taken this tablet into the sunlight yet. In the display settings there is a colour wheel as well as presets, I just haven't got around to messing with it yet.The tablet is nice and quick. Real snappy. The 8GB of ram is noticeable when opening and flipping between apps. I haven't had a slowdown yet in that regard.I installed 5 games. Call of duty mobile, pubg, Xbox game pass, and a couple sports games. Call of duty was ok, found when loading into levels it almost seemed to studder a bit till it got going in the match, then smoothed out. Pubg was great. Played a few rounds, no crashing, hitches, issues. Xbox game pass worked well, I have decent Internet so it wasnt too bad in lag terms. I blutoothed a controller, played Lego Fortnite for much longer than I anticipated for the test. I almost forgot I was on a tablet and not my Xbox.Movies and videos are great. I use this a lot for watching Plex and my IPTV. The sound is what really catches my attention. The stereo speakers are loud and sound great. I don't know why all tablets aren't like this! I will buy these tablets just on the speakers alone.If I were to make one request, it would be a case selection. I really like this tablet a lot and would love to use it at work. I'm a mechanic so having a rugged style case would be ideal. I'm hoping some variations come out soon.With all that said, I do recommend this tablet at this price point. I don't see where you will find anything as good for the value and performance of this unit.",
