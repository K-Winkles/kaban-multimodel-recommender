                "reviewText": "I bought 3 of these for my kids to complete school work on and they work pretty well for that but I would definitely spend the same amount on just a tablet if it is better in the future.Pros:- good price for what it is.- works like any other android device with the same apps- allows my kids to complete their school assignments all at once instead of waiting for a chromebook to be free.- durable. As a mom to 3 7-10 year olds I am impressed.- congress with a stylus that helps keep the screen clean.Cons:- the keyboard and mouse are very flimsy and somehow interfere with the internet even though they are bluetooth.- won't charge on most usb-c cables. I think I've found 1 charger that did anything but it was super slow.- usb-c cable is flimsy and will snap off in the port with proper use. I am down to 1 charger out of 3. I am the only one who connects and disconnects the chargers.- charges slowly. It takes forever to charge to a full battery and the battery doesn't last very long if you are working on it most of the day.- they show the case holding up the tablet but that doesn't work very well.- slow. It takes forever to load apps that are very quick on any other device.- the screen protector it comes with results in needing to tap the screen much harder than without it. My younger two get extremely frustrated with how hard they have to tap. It does work better with the stylus.- the screen/protector are definitely not fingerprint resistant. By the time I got them set up they were covered in fingerprints despite my clean hands.Overall I give it a 3/5, I will be replacing these with laptops because I really don't see them lasting more than a year or two.UpdateEvery one of these has stopped charging. The keyboards and mice no longer work at all. I am very disappointed with this purchase, I should have just bought better tablets to start with. Save your money or be prepared to replace these within a few months.",

                "reviewText": "Love this tablet and the pretty pink color. Works well, good sound but.... battery runs out faster than any tablet, phone or laptop I've ever owned, and it takes a long time to recharge. I would not buy this one again but look for something of better quality.Update: 7 weeks later and after only watching a movie on this tablet it no longer connects to the internet. Tried all the troubleshooting tips, factory reset after some difficulties and no way will it connect to the internet. Really disappointed that Amazon only has a 30 day return/refund policy. Can't get a replacement or refund. Makes me angry that these are still being sold after so many complaints and nothing being done. I'm a senior on a limited income and purchased this as a replacement for my older tablet which probably won't last much longer. Update: I was finally able to get this connected to the Internet but it keeps losing the signal and none of my other electronics have this problem. The keyboard and mouse will no longer connect even though they did at first. Someone else had this tablet before me, they're name was still to be found in the system. Didn't see that at first and bingo it popped up after trying to get this thing working for 2 days. Obviously this was a return and never got wiped properly. I paid for a new tablet not a used one. Well I finally got this to connect to the Internet but only for one day! Won't connect again despite trying everything. Really fed up with this useless tablet.",
