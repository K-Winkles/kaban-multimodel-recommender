Yes it is geared for use by kids so comes with some apps already installed, but honestly what electronics these days doesn't? Perfect for my elderly mother who needed something slightly bigger than her cell phone to play games on, but not so large as to be cumbersome for her. Ordered another for myself.",

                "reviewText": "At first this was weird. It came with a bunch of random unnecessary apps on it. It took me a while to figure out how to get them off of the tablet. (I\u2019m an IOS user) I\u2019m assuming if you\u2019ve used droids before that it might be easier to figure out how to remove.That being said, I got them off. I was then able to get both the kindle app, as well as ANKI downloaded onto the device and they both work fine.One big benefit with this compared to my iPad is that you have the ability to expand the memory capacity. I haven\u2019t needed to do so yet, but it\u2019s nice to know I\u2019ll have that option",
