I have to say that I'm very impressed with this tablet even considering it doesn't have a Snapdragon on it! Everything we have thrown at it has worked without any problems, without lowering the gaming experience and or performance. The speakers are also very good for what the tablet costs. I have an iPad Pro M1 and honestly, I found the volume and sound quality to be on par or very close to the iPad. The screen is crispy and smooth, with good definition, contrast and clarity. Very happy with this tablet and needless to say, my son is very very pleased with it.",

                "reviewText": "Updates will be posted on the top.Update #3 12/07/23My FE just got Android 14 with U.I. 6.0 Quick download and install no problems.Update #2 10/30/23I noticed one reviewer said they can't stream to their projector with this tablet as it runs slow. One thing I noticed about this tablet, and it is probably more the software is that out of box it appears apps are default set to run in the \"strict power saving\" mode. i accidently noticed this when I had trouble audio streaming via an app. So, I changed the power saving mode to \"optimizzed' and everything worked fine.Update #1 - 10/19/23.I charged the device from 19% to 85% (Samsung's recommended limit) using the Samsung 45-watt charger. It took 50 minutes. The same charge on my Tab A8 takes about 3.25 hours.It came a day early. The packaging was excellent.I also have a Tab A7 and Tab A8. I purchased the Tab S9 FE 10.9\" to replace the Tab A7 which stopped Android updates with Android 12.I also purchased Samsung's 45-watt charger. The battery was at 51%. I charged it to 91%, I didn't watch the clock so I don't know exactly how long it took but it was quick. I then used Samsung Flow used be Samsung Switch to copy my apps and data from the Tab A8. The Tab S9 came with a cable to I was able to use the wired method for the copying. it went pretty quick.All the apps except two copied. One for some reason is not compatible with the S9. The other I was able to install from Google Play. After that I spent a Few hours organizing my home screen with Microsoft Launcher and signing in and testing my music apps. The audio is okay but when I connected the tablet to one of Sound Core Bluetooth-Speakers I had to turn the volume down to under 25%.The S9 FE is definitely faster than the Tab A8. At one time I had about a half dozen apps open without a problem. The extra .4\" in the display over the A8 is nice. The tablet is definitely bright enough, I am keeping the brightness settings at about 10%.I haven't tried any games since I don't play them. I did check the download and upload speed and it was basically the same as the Tab A8 which is fine for me.As far as the OS goes. It came with Android 13 and Samsung U.I 5.1.1. However, the Android security update was Aug 1st. I imagine it will update soon enough. Google Play was June 2023. It took three restarts to bring it up to September which is a Google issue.That is it for now. I will post an update or two to this once I get more battery and other information.Another excellent product from Samsung.",

I read, write, research, play stupid games, shop, watch videos, access my printer, do everything with it.i\\It can't stay connected to wifi 6, ane won't restart correctly. Some sites were not rendering correctly.So, time for a new tablet.It seemed like complete overkill to buy this tablet. Don't you think so? But it is a gift, that I was encouraged to accept.We had a lot of AMEX reward dollars that made it easier to buy now that Amazon accepts them.I was, again, encouraged to get this big size. It is pretty big. Is that necessary? I doubt it.So far it runs well. It magically linked with my phone and now is a second phone. Along with my Samsung watch. See, I told you, too much stuff.To me it charges very slowly. A full charge lasts a long time.I am slow to get used to new things, but I think I like this device.Maybe there was a tablet priced between the Tab A and this one. Ok this is the one between the tab A and the S9 tab, I get it.I like that it is water resistant, but I never dunked the old Tab A.I bet this new tablet will be $200 off in six weeks.Oh, well.",

Even after loading all of my apps, I still have 97+GB of free space. It is heavier than my 4 year old Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2019), but I can still hold it with one hand for quite a while before fatigue sets in. I view this tablet as a very nice computer for the $$$ I spent on it. I believe I made a better choice than picking the Galaxy Tab A9+. Without a cover it can be a little slippery.",

You have to add a new phone line at Verizon for the tablet at $20/month plus a $35. \"activation\" fee so you can connect it to a cell tower and use it without WiFi, but you'll still need to carry your cell phone. Buy a WiFi only version, not one higher priced and set up for Verizon. Verizon was a nightmare to work with and then with no success.",
