Touch input was lagged, apps didn\u2019t operate as they were suppose to, at one point play store disappeared from the device (it somehow became disabled in settings). Its not running Android 12 it\u2019s running Android go, a stripped down version of Android meant for low end smartphones which may be part of the problem. Even if you were just using this for watching video and occasionally looking at the internet it would be an incredibly frustrating slog. For the money you\u2019d have a lot better luck just getting a fire tablet and installing play services on it",

I have a much older 8\" tablet with a far better sound quality. It wasn't too easy to set up either, seemed like it needed 4 restarts and then a very long upload period to update the Google apps which are the only apps that I have put on the tablet so far. I feel that my older Kyocera tablet was much easier to set up and was more intuitive, with a better quality picture and sound. But for the price point it really can't be beat.",

I liked that you could add memory which I did (probably the only pro). For the price I didn\u2019t expect excellence but I did expect it would last physically. However the screen cracked on the first day and the now the entire screen won\u2019t respond to touch leaving it completely useless. It didn\u2019t even fall. It slid between the 3 inch bunk mattress and the wall and somehow that broke it. Doesn\u2019t make any sense and the bunk in connected to the wall so it really was only between a wall and mattress for a total of three inches. I added a picture of the bunk. now my money I spent on this is lost. Mind you, this also broke on day 1 of an 8 day trip at sea so I didn\u2019t have shows for entire duration of the trip. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb It also would not connect to my AirPods at all! I had to buy wired headphones for it.I requested a replacement and will update my review pending any changes",
