                "reviewText": "At this price, with these hardware specs (and older version of Android), this is NOT a top of the line tablet... and while setting it up, I was ready to really dislike it. I had a few false starts on setup, some really long pauses during installs of various components, and other burps and hiccups...... and then, once I actually began to USE the tablet for what I wanted (web browsing, light gaming, social media) I found that it was really quite decent. Granted, you get into anything super RAM needy, or high res streaming video, and you might end up with some burps-- but for the nice \"gentle\" tablet uses, it does GREAT!I play games like Candy Crush, Angry BIrds, etc...... nothing like GTA or CPU/Console games (they'd likely kill this unit, LOL). My games, however, run really smoothly-- no problems. Honestly, I haven't really had any issues other than the occasional \"I'm older tech, please bear with me\" type of thing.If this is looking good to you, with all its specs (or lack thereof) and price, go for it. The only thing I'm not thrilled about is the older version of Android.",

No slowness or buffering issues noticed.The build is very sturdy feeling, not cheap/plastic like most and doesn't feel like a toy!",

                "reviewText": "Got this mainly for those longer airplane flights and layovers in airports, usually watch movies and play games on my phone, but my friend brought his tablet last time and it made a huge difference.This ASUS tablet performed better than I expected, large 10.4 inch screen, fast bootup, quick response time and the 2K graphics made my games and movies look awesome, bright, crisp and clear. I have a high end gaming PC at home, and I know the limitations of tablets and non-gamer laptops and computers, so I didn't expect it to be able to run the more demanding titles, however the less CPU intensive games ran perfectly and as mentioned looked awesome on the 2K display.For movies it rocked, the internal speakers are OK, but since I am at an airport or in a plane I used earbuds, and of course their sound was awesome, but if you're intending on using the internal speakers they do the job satisfactory. Battery life was very good, I was able to watch several full length movies without having to recharge it, and recharge also seemed pretty quick to full charge. It comes with 128GB internal storage, however I doubled that by simply adding a MicroSD card, so now I have 256GB, more than enough for my needs. The selling price was $249 when I ordered, a great performing tablet for that price.NOTE! The reason for 4 star review and not 5, I was unable to update the OS from Android 12 to 13, so the OS is about a year or more old, I am hoping ASUS comes out with a fix for that so I can update the OS, but so far Android 12 has been running great on it, so hopefully all will be OK either way.",
