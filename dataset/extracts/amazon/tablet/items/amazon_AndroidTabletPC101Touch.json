It is a little slow on touch recognition but it was okay as it was ment for the kids mainly. It doesn't Inpact gameplay as far as I can tell (plants vs zombies and other small games). The main issue I had is when connecting to public wifi which was very frustrating. With my phone I could click a notification that would allow me to accept the terms and conditions of that public network such as hotels, fast food places etc. But the notification was not on this tablet. Which I thought it would be okay I can usually get it if I search up a news website like abc, fox or something very basic. Still did not work with this tablet. I looked for hours online and came across THIS TIP of typing a url that doesn't have an http address. Sort of what I did before but for my table if you type \"example.com\" it worked to bring up the terms and conditions of public wifi. I hoped this helped someone!!",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this tablet for myself believe it or not I've never had a tablet in my life, so I decide to why not the price was right even though the name I wasn't familiar with it didn't matter I figured why not give it a try so I received a tablet turned it on everything's working well the only problem I have with this is that when you use a pen with the end it touches the screen if you're touching letters or numbers sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't also you have to be careful make sure you have your Wi-Fi and it's secure because for some reason this company has their own which I find it odd that bothered me a lot they shouldn't but it's there so just be advised of that. I also downloaded like prime and some other apps Google Chrome everything seems to be working well the only thing I have problem with is like I said sometimes you really have to touch the screen with your finger instead of with the pen with the plastic end for the screen, oh and since I have Xfinity Wi-Fi I have the app itself on my phone every time I turn on the Wi-Fi and it's in my name it's locked it gives me two different names it'll say the name of the product or it'll say another name which is frustrating because usually when you have anything like your laptop or your phone and it's assigned to your Xfinity Wi-Fi with a code anytime you log into it it should come up the same so for example I have my television that's Wi-Fi and it's a TLC Roku so anytime we log on to that and we go on it it shows on my Xfinity but with this tablet it's always showing either the product itself or it will say and I'll tell you right now cuz I'm going to look at my phone so basically the MAC address keeps changing so one minute it will tell you the device name which is Sannuo K708 or it will log on on my private Wi-Fi as unknown and it won't even say it's a tablet it would say it's either let me spell it Misc Device. I believe this shouldn't be happening because like I said an emphasize that if you have Xfinity Wi-Fi and you have a user's name password and you put it on the tablet it's just show up the name of the tablet all the time the same one but nope every time it's a different address and I have to go in and forget that device and then it'll save the name the one I put up on top case k708 or like I said a miscellaneous it's it's aggravating really I think it should just be easy to just log in and turn on your Wi-Fi and Xfinity app shouldn't be constantly notifying you that this device just logged in when it belongs to me and it's on my in my name so there's a problem with this they need to fix it there's too much Mac address this shouldn't be that many and also again they have their own Wi-Fi so I like it the Price is Right but I don't like the fact that one they have too many Mac addresses to they have their own Wi-Fi so make sure if you're going to purchase this to have your own Wi-Fi password and make sure it's locked okay so nobody can get in there and still your information okay aside from that I have installed Norton virus and it works well with the tablets everything works well I just have issues with private privacy to be more exact I feel as though this company has too many Mac addresses and that's not good but aside from that it's working good for the exception of the buttons it's not too bad but I mean I've done emailing from here but no problem I've even did some searching no problem I've even watched a movie on here the clarity was great the sound was good so all for the price you getting for it and the size is good and like I mentioned there the only little problems there is what I mentioned aside from that I recommended just be careful and just follow what I said and you won't you shouldn't have a problem if anything comes up trust and believe me I will be back to write a review another one. But for now everything is working fine for the exception of what I mentioned so yeah I do recommend this but be cautious okay.",
