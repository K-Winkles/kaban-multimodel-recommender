It came with everything I need, including a hard cover case and screen protector. Best of all it came with its own charging block! I know that might sound silly but nothing comes with a block these days and I'm always having to switch my electronics out to charge so that was nice. It was very easy to set up, super fast, and most importantly super easy to use. It takes great pictures too! I love how easy it is to read everything on the screen so it would be good for older folks too who might have a little bit harder time seeing. Recommend the buy!",

                "reviewText": "I am so happy with this tablet. From the moment I opened the package I continue to be impressed.Video, Audio , Camera and every other aspect of this unit works well because someone took pride in making it right.Packaging was excellent.Setup was a breeze (other than Google and my phone not cooperating so I can authenticate)Screen is 11 inches, which works great for my \"older\" eyes, very bright and unbelievable quality.Sound quality is great for small speaker and has a volume booster in the settings.Both front and rear facing cameras are very clear and auto focus is responsive, so you can use it for video calls or snapping photos.RAM is good and you can convert some of the storage space to improve the performance if needed in Memory Extension under settings.Slim built and the included case is much better than most out there as it is made with a wrap around silicon based material that will not break when dropped or squeezed. BTW they included a screen protector for those of us that tend to drop things and and crack screens.It is all the small things that make me happy as a user and someone has thought this tablet through before making it. Kudos to all involved for a great product at a small price.Do not hesitate to buy it ! You can't go wrong with this one.",

                "reviewText": "Awesome price/quality combination. For this price my expectations were not that high, but was well surprised. Screen is pretty decent, easy to watch full-hd movies. 4K videos are usually lagging, but 2k runs okay. Sound from external speakers is loud and works well for watching mvoies (music not so much). 8gb ram is more then enough and this tablet is flying. Good thing is that it comes with it's cover as well. The only thing was the shipping. It was stating initially that it was probably delivered but it wasn't so I requested a refund which I got immediately, but a week later the tablet arrived. Otherwise happily surprised with the tablet",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I just got my tablet a few days ago, and I'm truly enjoying it. I'm writing this review using the Bluetooth keyboard and the mouse that came with the tablet. The keyboard is essentially a full-sized keyboard, minus the number pad that nobody uses anyway. The keyboard has a slot in the back that securely holds the tablet and makes this feel more like a laptop than a tablet. The mouse connects via a USB dongle, and works even on smooth flat surfaces. So far, I'm very impressed with the tablet itself. The video rendering speed, the sound/volume, the battery life -- all excellent, and all figure heavily into the great value for money that you'll get with this unit. I've also had some interaction with the support staff, and they were very prompt and helpful. You cannot go wrong with this tablet! If you have any questions of me, please don't hesitate to ask!",

I have installed several apps and there is LOTS of storage space still available. I like the type C charging port-common to android devices now. The sound is great-we like to use it in landscape mode to watch streaming shows/movies. The battery holds up well- I turned down the brightness which has helped to extend the battery. It comes with a case to protect it and a screen saver. I would recommend this tablet if you are looking for a great Android tablet.",

I believe this has been the most impressive battery yet in a (Samsung popular choices or Apple) cell phone.The screen is wonderfully responsive and the OS responds quickly.I will be using this for work related things, I think, since it performs so reliably and I very much enjoy using this tablet. So much for possibly giving it as a gift like I originally planned!! Lol.",

My Amazon Fire 10 recently died and since it doesn't have the Google Play Store, I was hoping this would be a good replacement. It was not. Compared to the Fire the screen feels very cheap to the touch and my finger does not glid easily. The case is also a little wonky. More importantly in game, when trying to zoom in and out, it was not responsive. A lot of my touches were not registering at all, so I played for about two minutes, and this went back into the box for a return. I did not realize an off brand would be so off. Oh well. I guess I will try my luck with Samsung.",
