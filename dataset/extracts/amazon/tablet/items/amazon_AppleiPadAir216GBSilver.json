When we went to set it up most of the storage on it is used up by OS and system info. It left 4gb for him to add apps and such. After getting it set up we realized it keeps dying after being removed from charger within ten minutes. We messaged Amazon who told us to talk to sellers. We bought a case and screen protector for this tablet and now can\u2019t return either. The seller told us to simply return it. If we return it now my son would have nothing for the flight as we wouldn\u2019t get the refund in time to buy another tablet. They sent me a picture of a return slip that has no option to save share or print so how do we return it at all? They offered no help not even to send a replacement. So we are stuck with a broken iPad until we finish with our move. Seller is awful. This iPad is awful. I bought a 27\u201d iMac desk top that was renewed 2 years ago and have had no issues should have stuck with that seller. I can\u2019t say enough. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!",

                "reviewText": "I was worried about buying a refurbished iPad, but I decided to take the chance. (The warranty helps ease concerns.) The iPad arrived very quickly & like new. The difference between the iPad Air & Air 2 is very slight. The display is slightly better & the system seems to operate more quickly. I'm very pleased with this purchase and the savings, and the only downfall was that the charger did not work at all. Fortunately I already have 2 chargers, so this was not a huge issue for me, but I would suggest the chargers should be tested before shipping out to customers who may not be as fortunate to have a spare.",
