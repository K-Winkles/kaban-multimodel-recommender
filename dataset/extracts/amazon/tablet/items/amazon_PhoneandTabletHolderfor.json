                "reviewText": "TL;DR: buy this one if you use a concept2 machine in the gym instead of owning one at home or if you don\u2019t want to pay the extra $15 for the official one from concept2. I rowed for years. I watch YouTube/Netflix on my iPad whenever I row long sessions (>45 minutes). So I have tried multiple tablet holders for concept2 during these years.The first one was from an individual seller on eBay. It cost me $19. It is 3D printed but without any padding, so the place it touches the tablet is quite slippery. I have to stick some foam pads on it to prevent my iPad from sliding off, but the friction is still less than optimal. So I avoid using it during short interval sessions when the machine shakes a little bit. Pros: it at least can hold a tabletCons: slippery, not so steady, not very well-made. The second one was from Concept2, which comes with a new machine manufactured after mid-2021. I brought my machine before that and it did not come with that official tablet holder. So I brought this holder myself. It costed me $35 ($25 + $10 shipping). It is the best among all three. It holds the tablet very steady. It also does not require the monitor arm to be strictly vertical, so it is easier to reach PM5 while sitting on the seat. The only downside is you have to replace your hold monitor arm with its new arms, so you cannot bring this holder with you if you go to a gym. Pros: Steady, easy to put the tablet on and off, PM5 still reachable with it installed. Cons: expensive, need installation, you cannot bring it with you to use on a public machine.The third one is this one. It cost me $18 (I have prime). It is molded plastic instead of 3D printed, so it feels more premium and grabs the monitor arms more steadily. It also has silicon mats, so the tablet won\u2019t slide horizontally. I would say that it fixed every complaint I had with the first one I got. And I carry this one with me when I row in the gym instead of at home. Pros: Steady, easy to use and install, you can take it to any machine you useCons: monitor arm need to be vertical, so PM5 is slightly harder to reach",

                "reviewText": "Like everyone, I was looking for a tablet mount for the concept 2. It's easy to install and works well, so it has that. But ultimately you'll need to charge your phone or tablet so you'll need to take out of the holder and that's where all the problems are. You have to take it apart to remove the device and put it back together once charged. It's not hard and doesn't take too long but it's not instant like all the other spin bike holders that expand to hold your device.Since starting to row i don't spin anymore and I use my spin bike mount instead as it right next to it. I have a dedicated older tablet I use for the concept 2. I only need to charge it once a week and it's annoying enough that I use my spin bike holder instead. Oh well. But if you are looking for a dedicated holder for the concept 2 this is the one to get. The arm is the concept 2 is too big for a spin bike mount, so this is the best available.",

But really it\u2019s bad, and to make matters worse nothing here should cost more than $1 USD. That\u2019s it.This could be so easily printed here, in country, but that\u2019s too much. Actually this product is literally all that is wrong with domestic manufacturing.No quality, cheap, and even as such couldn\u2019t be made here. Just get C2 hanger. It\u2019s great.",
