I ordered this item to replace my 5 year old daughters broken table and for a Christmas gift, when received me and my wife downloaded games and educational tools for her for learning and appeard to be fine, on Christmas and still till now the tablet is slow and freezes up bad, when she opened her gift she was full of excitement, it's not the cache or cookies or anything like that, but with these issues it upsets our child that this happens, and also to mention the sound issues, it is very quiet even with the volume all the way up, we have to put our ear up to it to hear anything, spent what little money we had left for this and the protection plan, to end up what feels like a paper weight, it is upsetting to have seen her be so happy to only be upset with this . All such items should have a better quality check,",
