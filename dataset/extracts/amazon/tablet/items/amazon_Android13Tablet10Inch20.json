Right now it is independent, thus easy to lose, or not bring with you. It also has a mouse and a stylus. which also have no dedicated way to keep with the tablet, so will also require another bag or case to travel with these.I have no intention on using the camera feature as i have other devices for that that would likely be better quality. I do wish the tablet would respond to the Galaxy ultras stylus though, as then i would always have a stylus with me, but it doesnt unfortunately",

                "reviewText": "Using it right now to write reviews. Appears well made and is a standard android tablet. It powers up much faster than my android phone or any other android devices that I have used. Guess that's thanks to the updated Android 13 and 12 Gigs of ram. It easily paired with both my home wifi and my phone which has much of the stuff that I have been using on my iPad (the iPad is MANY years old no longer supported for updates and beginning to reject websites and freezing up -- had to go). The included cover is useable, not much more. It will keep the tablet standing at about an 80 degree angle, nothing less, back is just not strong enough. The mouse is acceptable, like a similar one I have but this one is easier to open to place the batteries. The biggest negatives are: 1) the tablet is HEAVY, and a power eater. I'm seeing about 4 to 5 hours of use per charge. But that's good enough for me and it does recharge fast. 2) As to charging, it only works with the dedicated, short cable that comes with it. I tried it out with a couple others that I know work and they were no goes for this device. So much for cutting down number of cables needed thanks to \"universal\" USB-C charging. 3) Finally, the keyboard is, again, useable but I'm not. For some reason the escape and function keys on top row are not colored white like normal keys are. Instead, I had a keyboard I bought years ago almost identical, with all keys colored white and backlit so it's easy to use in dim light. That makes it the default for me. All in all, the tablet is useful and has proven to be reliable so far. ((Oh, the swipe motion to bring up apps, etc needs to be in the center of the screen, not from the bottom. I found it to be a little bit of a learning curve but not serious. It's a keeper and for the price I'd buy it again.",
