Does NOT come with instructions or any information about the Tablet. The Tablet arrived in decent condition, I saw no scratches or damage on the device.Once I power up the Tablet and setup, first thing I notice was the bright sharp screen. I was replacing my old Tablet was the Samsung Tab A (2016). When I upgraded to the Tab A (2019), it was simplicity to set up. I was smart enough to know not to expect a manual to come with the refurbished device. So I went on-line to a Samsung website and download the manual for free. I like finding all those little tricks and short cuts that you normal don't know about. Especially the double tap the blank screen to open the device. I am a fan of SCREEN SHOT. The idea of pressing the ON and Volume button at the same time is cumbersome and just down right annoying. Now, I wave my palm across the screen and the SCREEN SHOT automatically done. The battery life is nothing to write home about. I can squeeze about 9 to 10 hours out of the Tablet with the Power Saving Mode on. The quick charge was impressive for a Tablet. I used the device for Business Travel and it fit my working needs.",

The screen is bright and clear of any defects.. The battery life is slightly less than brand new but no worse than my old tablet was. So far I'm very pleased with this product.",

                "reviewText": "I just got this tablet today for our son to use. I will update on the value and use later. However presently it seems great screen quality and the set up was fast and easy. The picture is clear and I don\u2019t notice any cosmetic flaws. They sent the wrong charger. The one They sent (pictured) Is not only the wrong shape it is also the wrong size and too small for the charger port. This is very dissatisfying as I was really hoping to set it up tonight and become familiar with it. I will now have to find time to go and by a charger for it that fits. It did come with some battery life 15% so I was able to turn it on and do the basic start up. I will have to wait till I get a charger to download apps and familiarize myself with it.***Update*** this tablet was great at first after I bought a correct charger for it. However after about 6months use the tablet started getting slower. I continued to make sure all updates were done and made sure not too many apps were on the device. It has gotten even more slow over the past month and February will be 1 year of having it. We don\u2019t even use it daily maybe 1-2 times a week. It\u2019s so slow now it\u2019s just frustrating to try to use. Looks like I will be having to find another one to replace it. Such a disappointment.",
