There is also th3 ability to increase storage if need be. This purchase is a great one for me and will definitely be a great one for you.",

                "reviewText": "Arrived 3 days early and was well packaged as it came from the US to Mexico. Nice tablet, good lighting. Fairly easy to set up and start reading. I bought this tablet, great price too, mainly for reading from the Libby app. Can read 2 pages at once with good sized font (for older eyes) compared to my phone (one page and much smaller font). My only complaint is that it only allows about 4 hours of reading time before I have to recharge it. Well, guess that means I have time to get up and do other things. I do like it very much but if I had to buy again, would go with something with a little longer battery time before recharging.",
