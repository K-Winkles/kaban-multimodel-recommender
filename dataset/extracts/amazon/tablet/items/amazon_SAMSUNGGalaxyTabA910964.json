                "reviewText": "I upgraded from a Galaxy A8 and loving this tablet, except for the current software bug effecting these A9 models. There is an issue with the multi-point touch such as when pinch zooming or playing a game that involves 2 fingers touching at the same time. It is very glitchy. You kinda have to finesse the pinch zoom with a light touch and it will work. If you don't play games and aren't constantly using the pinch zoom function which most probably aren't, you will hardly notice the issue. Though if you play games involving multi-touch, this will be a problem for you. Strangely though, if you plug corded headphones into the jack, the problem stops, really weird. It does seem to just be a software bug though and Samsung should be able to fix the problem with an update patch. Unfortunately little problems like this are just part of the technological world we live in now and occasionally happens to the devices we use and they need to be updated. Other than that though... This tablet feels nice and light, runs fast and smooth with the upgraded processor and increased 8GB of RAM on the A9+ model, and the screen has a beautiful bright picture with nice deep and vibrant colors. I did a side by side HD video comparison with my A8 and the picture on the A9 is quite a noticeable improvement. And I see people saying that there's didn't come with a charger as if it's a mistake. It is not a mistake, Samsung doesn't send chargers with their products anymore. They say it's to minimize their impact on the environment or whatever, and also because I think they know most people have plenty of charging blocks and USB C cables laying around at this point being that so many products use them now, and if you don't you can buy one very cheap. With all that said, if you can deal with the current multi-touch problem until it's fixed, I highly recommend getting this tablet as everything else about it is great!",

The device is advertised as coming with a free book cover. It did not. I contacted customer service and they gave me a very generous adjustment.",

                "reviewText": "I really wanted to love this tablet. Everything is fine about this tablet except the screen. If you have a recent Amazon Fire tablet they all have IPS screens which are better than the cheap TFT screens that Samsung is using in these tablets. The screen looks okay as long as you don't turn on the blue light or what they call eye comfort. As soon as you turn that on the screen turns in eerie washed out orange. On screens that are OLED or IPS they don't suffer from the same washed out look when the blue light filter is on. I was hoping this was going to be better than my Firemax 11 which has an IPS screen but it's not. The screen quality is more important to me so I returned this.",

I am not someone who is on it all day but even using it off an on during the day, it has a battery life of about 4 hours. Even if it stays in sleep mode the entire day, it doesn't last even 8 hrs. I haven't had this issue with Samsung tablets before so I don't know if this was a return or defective because I have noticed in the last year, the quality of the items I have received from Amazon have declined greatly. I have received items in damaged product boxes or ones that look like they have already been used even though it's sold as new and you pay full price. I don't know if this is a Samsung problem or Amazon/seller issue but I will probably return it and buy it directly from a store.",
