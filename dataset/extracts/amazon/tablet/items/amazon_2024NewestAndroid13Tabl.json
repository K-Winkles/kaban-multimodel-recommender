The seller was very helpful and responsive and actually refunded the entire amount of my purchase.For what it is worth, I ordered one directly from AT&T and after a week of calls, chats and more, it has been determined to be defective and I am still waiting for a refund or replacement.Tablet is great for the price and the seller is terrific and much easier to communicate with than AT&T.",

So far it is a decent tablet, the pictures showed the keyboard and tablet together standing up, but that is not the case. It will not stand up, you will have to purchase an other case for that. The stylus was broken when I got it out of the box. The tablet came fully charged and was easy to set up. Another thing I didn't like was it says it's 4gb ram but when you look at the clearing screen it states on 2gb of ram, so I don't know which it is. But for the price it's working well at the moment. I'll update if that changes.",

The company went out of its way to get me to change my review to a pleasant one, for which I obliged after a $20 refund. However, here we are again, NOT A MONTH LATER!!! The SD card has to be reformatted AGAIN!!! My wife turned it on to play her games and without warning, her \"SD card is missing\" [PICTURED BELOW] and nothing can fix it except to reformat it. She is completely heartbroken that all of her games she paid for are gone.Looking for customer support on their Amazon page and it's impossible despite the last time they said it was right \"there\" somewhere, but looking for it now is such a hassle. It's just a hassle to have a tablet for less than a month (September 28th and here it is October 25th) and this happens AGAIN!I gave this a 3-star review because the other tablet is working okay for now. We spent nearly $300 for two cheap tablets and this is what we get.",

                "reviewText": "Another unbiased review. I have always been an iPad person and have gone through several versions, even now I still love my iPad but let's be real, lacking wide screen makes video watching boring, and you miss the nice letter box feel most movies have, and so I decided to invest in my first Android tablet, granted I have played with Android phones and other tablets as well and I am rather familiar with multiple Android versions but I have not owned one myself. To minimize the risk and the expense I decided to get these inexpensive Chinese builds and I tell you am impressed.Not bloated with unnecessary softwareWell designed - again not an iPad in marksmanship but still well designed.Very responsiveLots of featuresTo be fair it would be wrong to give it 4 stars just because it does not have WiFi 5Ghz, so whatever.. I still gave it 5 stars.If you are looking for an inexpensive Android tablet, one that you wouldn't care if it breaks or gets lost, etc, etc. I highly recommend this one. If it had a bigger screen I'd probably swap this one for the bigger screen, I am sure other Android tablets here are just as good if not better than this one, but can't speak on those, I can only speak on this one and so far exceeded my expectations.",
