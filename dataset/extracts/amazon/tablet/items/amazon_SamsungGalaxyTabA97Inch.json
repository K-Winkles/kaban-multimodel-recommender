                "reviewText": "This is a great tablet for the price, as a manufacturer refurbished product. It's definitely a deal compared to purchasing it brand new, which is about an 80 dollar difference to the price being sold on amazon. The only downside is that it might have minor cosmetic issues (two white spots on the bottom part of my screen, for example) and technically the warranty that comes with this tablet might not cover that. Fortunately it's not very noticeable and not too bothersome so I don't really want to go through the process of returning it just for that. Overall this tablet performs quickly and functions really well for my needs, which are to browse the web, check email, stream movies, play games, read books and write documents with the free microsoft office apps that comes pre-installed. If your main concern is to watch 1080P HD movies or edit high resolution photos then this tablet might not be for you. You would probably be better off spending more for the galaxy tab S2 for that reason, and if you want a high end performance from a tablet as well.",

I used Samsung Smart Switch too get some of the stuff on my Galaxy S7 onto the tablet, and that was fantastic! Almost fully automatic after I determined what I wanted on the tablet, and was fast and painless.Thanks Samsung!",

                "reviewText": "I loooove my new tablet! It looks & works like it's brand new! After having a small tablet, I was very impressed by the size of the screen. I love how when I flip it horizontally the screen is big enough so that I can type like I would on a real physical keyboard. I'm not very tech savvy by any means but I'm very happy with this purchase.",
