                "reviewText": "This is a shockingly terrible computer. The look and feel is extremely cheap. The thing felt incredibly flimsy, and the entire keyboard could be pushed in without much effort. Awkward feeling keyboard feel and layout too. The screen quality was awful. If you weren't looking at the exact perfect angle, the screen would appear faded out and the color would change. It has an extremely narrow range of viewing angles. I could never adjust my eyes to the color, and photos would look simply terrible. My Chromebook has vastly superior color rendering, and the screen looks good at a wide range of viewing angles. The resolution was purported to be 1080, but the pixels seemed very large and most things appeared \"blocky\". But the worst part of this computer was the performance. Unbelievably slow! Web pages would take forever to load, text would come in, and a bunch of white boxes would appear on screen until each image would load. It is not my connection either, as I ran this computer right next to my Chromebook, which had none of these loading problems. This computer was so slow that it would literally hang up while I was typing! I would start to type a sentence, and nothing would happen on screen, then a few seconds later, the words would start to show up. I closed everything but one web browser to compose an email, and I could not write simple text without the computer lagging behind. It was beyond terrible to the point I may have just gotten a lemon. But if this was not a broken machine, it's the worst computer I have ever used. Returned it less than a week after using, I was fed up!",

For what I need it for, this laptop is perfect. Besides that, it's good for browsing the web. I wouldn't recommend using it for much more than that. It does not have much memory and the screen isn't the clearest. But again, if you need a basic Windows laptop, you can't go wrong with this at this price point. It was painfully slow when I booted it up for the first time, but it seems that once it updated and loaded everything it needed to, it's reasonably quick as long as you don't over burden it with tasks.",

I bought it because my original chrome book died out and I was in a crunch for college. 200 dollars for this is crazy because it sucks. I tried completing the FAFSA form on this too and I had to restart my computer 5 separate times. Please just save your money.
