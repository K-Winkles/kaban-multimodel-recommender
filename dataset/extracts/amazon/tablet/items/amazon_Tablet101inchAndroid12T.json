But the Dell equivalent was like 3x the price so no complaints for my child user.Aside from the product, my device stopped working after about 3 months. After examination, the USB-C charger it came with was corroded. I switched chargers and it started working again. A couple weeks later, no charger would work. I contacted FEONAL (why does this always remind me of fentanyl) and they promptly and courteously replaced my product.",
