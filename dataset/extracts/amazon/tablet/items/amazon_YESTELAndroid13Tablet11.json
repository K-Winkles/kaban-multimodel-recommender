The tablet holds a charge for a very long time which is very impressive. I chose it for the larger screen I highly recommend this tablet and seller. You can't go wrong with this great tablet. Don't waste twice the money and buy a name brand tablet that does the same exact thing as this little beauty. I also like the case that came with it I just wish it was a darker blue. I use it mostly for reading and gaming. Works exactly as I need it to.",

                "reviewText": "I'm a software engineer with a lifetime of experience with gadgets of all shapes and sizes. I feel like I can accurately review this from both a technology and a consumer standpoint but I will try to keep it short and sweet as these reviews can get pretty lengthy.I had originally planned to purchase a very popular tablet that came from the \"rain forest\", peddled by a merchant who's name rhymes with shmeff pesos.I was annoyed to find out that shmeff's tablet didn't have the google play store and I'd need to jump through a bunch of hoops to use it as a normal android tablet. I was also annoyed that shmeff offers a versions that has lock screen ads which I find to be just abominable regardless of the price savings as I feel like this is not something that should ever be normalized.This tablet has roughly double the overall specs of the best rain forest tablet and it's a regular Android device which means it's not locked into any ecosystem and you can do whatever you want with it. This is the way technology should be.Now that the philosophical part is out of the way, here's what I do with it and how well it works for me:I mainly bought this to use as a portable media device, basically a small TV. For that reason, I really appreciate the 2K screen which is of excellent quality. I use this with Plex, Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, etc. and it works great with all of them because it's a completely unlocked android device.- The overall fit and finish of the device is great. It feels solid and build quality is tight. 5 stars- It's very thin overall and has thin bezels so it feels like a premium device- When using the device, there are a few times where it's felt a just a peck sluggish but overall it's pretty snappy and doesn't have any issues whatsoever. HOWEVER, if your comparison is a tablet made by shmim brook or the late shmeve hobs, you may feel like it's under-powered or less polished than it could be in the UI/UX department. This is likely because this tablet costs a quarter of the price and because you are comparing apples to macadamia nuts.For the price, I think this is the best option. If you are extremely tech challenged, you may prefer to be trapped in the rain forest where everything is spoon-fed to you but if you can watch a youtube video to solve a problem, you can have a better device at the same or less cost.",

Everything else about this unit is great. Screen is crystal clear, bright and sharp. Touch screen sensitivity is just right. Videos play with no lag or stuttering. Sound is good, not exceptional but, hey it's a tablet. For the money it can't be beat!",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I am impressed with the quality, build, performance and accessories included with this unit. For the price it cannot be beat. The screen protector also came installed which saved me headache to have to worry about bubbled and in case needed, there are extra screen protectors as well. I was able to purchase a small tablet carrying case that very conveniently fits everything that came with the tablet. For me, this is dual use, which is work and play. I can run work apps without problem and will run android games with reasonable performance. All in all, I'd say 10/10 for what I needed this for. Again, for the price, it just cannot be beat. It also came with more ram and professing power than any of the other choices so this one was an easy desicion to make.",

                "reviewText": "The screen looks nice and that's it. The screen is buggy and filled with latency, fails to load most apps i have tried. Within 2 weeks I decided this will only be used for spotify and an alarm clock, with the occasional file reader. It's great for reading documents. But the processor or cpu or whatever makes things run smoothly and allows it to send commands, is garbage. So if all you want to do is download and read files, sure I can recommend it for that. Anything beyond that I'd urge you use a different option.",
