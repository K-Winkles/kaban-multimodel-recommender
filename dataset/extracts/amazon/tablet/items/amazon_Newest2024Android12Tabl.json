                "reviewText": "I got this tablet for about $130 on sale. It delivers performance that would be appreciable at $180 to 200... The acessory set is decent, and the keyboard is actually pretty solid. Tablet is fast, pretty responsive, and has good battery life. Excellent as a reader or media veiwer. Unit is sturdy, and does not feel \"cheap\". Has a decent weight to it. Screen has an odd finish, but that goes away after some use.I would advise any buyers to use a 3rd party launcher (nova, etc..), as the default \"Quickstep\" launcher is very, very basic and just kinda ugly. Also, for some reason, this slab doesn't like the YouTube app, but if you use NewPipe or install youtube as a webapp from the browser, it works fine.The \"Dura Speed\" and \"Memory Expansion\" options in settings do seem to increase the responsiveness of the unit somewhat.Great for someone with basic tablet needs, may not deliver gaming performance for younger or more demanding users.",

Battery is great and charges fast. So glad I choose this one, I have had for a week, and more than happy...",

                "reviewText": "I needed an Android based tablet to connect to my cars OBDII port to read computer diagnostics on a Prius Gen 2 model. You get a better experience with an Android device than using iPhone hand held device.I wasn't prepared for what I got. It has a KEYBOARD, a MOUSE, a CASE COVER and I think a pen(?). They had me at the Cover... no guessing what to get as it had one!So far it works great. I am actually switching out the keyboard it came with to one that has a mouse track pad on it. Less things to carry and the keyboard I had already for use on my cell phone.the price was fantastic. This is my first personal Android tablet so I'm still learning. I opted to get a WiFi model because I can piggy back off my home/work internet provider hotspots throughout California. I can also use my phone's internet.As I look back on this purchase, I should have purchased two of them when they were on sale. The price I was willing to pay was great, then Amazon included a coupon price discount and made it an even better deal.Honestly, I am getting way more than the Samsung I purchased for my father. That had no cover or other peripherals, so it was way more expensive. But he likes Samsung and dad gets what he gets.I am loving this tablet. Fits in my computer bag real easy. I now have to figure out how to make it work as an additional screen for my laptop. I'm told that is possible with Mac devices... I just Google'd it and it is possible. Just wish I had my laptop with me.This is a nice new toy for me!",
