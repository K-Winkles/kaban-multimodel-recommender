I cannot say anything about game playing (not my thing) but it does perfectly well for the activities I bought it for. It substituted very nicely both my Kindle and my old Asus tablet. Nothing is perfect: - I could do without the ads but they show only once every time the screen wakes up (you can pay to get rid of them) - it comes sort of locked to the Amazon app world but it is very easy to \"open\" it up and install other apps from the Google world; you WILL lose the warranty but will gain a ton of flexibility app wise, without losing (that I've seen) any functionality from the installed Amazon OS - the home screen is not very configurable; even when you \"open\" the OS you will not have the flexibility of the common Android interface; I say \"open\" in the sense that you can install apps not originally from the Amazon app store, not substitute the Amazon tweaked Android that comes installedAnd many good things: - very good screen, responsiveness is great (for what I use it) - good sound (not excellent) - wi-fi works really well, both 2G and 5G - and the occasional Amazon app that I dislike (Amazon Photos, for instance) I installed something else; another example, I use VLC for watching movies - the build is excellent, at least from the outside (I am not going to open it to check inside)Looking at other tablets, I would have to pay 10 times as much to have something as good as my Fire!",

                "reviewText": "I was initially reticent to receive this tablet because I'd read reviews when it was released; but my wife actually purchased the Fire Tab on Prime day, at a significantly reduced price, without knowing what I knew. Admittedy, when I set up the tablet and started to use it, I did not like it. I had formerly used a Samsung tab, and its battery-life notwithstanding, I was very happy with its picture, screen and functionality. The Fire tab differed from my Samsung in that all the apps fitted on one \"home\" screen and the apps were Amazon-centric. I couldn't load YouTube TV or GMail or any of my other Google-based apps. I started by watching YouTube TV through the Silk browser and accessing GMail through their (Amazon's) workaround GMail app, which was limited in functionality. Those first weeks were frustrating to say the least.Eventually, I found a six-step process to load Google services and the Google store on the Fire tab; this allowed me to download all of the apps I wanted and had used without issue on my Samsung. I would highly encourage anyone whose situation mirrors my own to take this action...It will improve your experience on the Fire tab exponentially.As for the ads, which again, my wife had opted for without consulting with me first, I don't notice them; they are incidental and do not affect my experience at all. I'm sure, if you were to research how to remove them, there is a way.All that aside, the picture and sound is very good, and the Fire's battery life is entirely better than my Samsung's. But to be honest, I didn't need this tab and it's not such an improvement on my old one that I would endorse it's purchase (if you have a functional, 10\" tab already).I did buy a slimline, bluetooth keyboard after the fact, and I like the idea of it if not it's actual functionality. The keyboard is as wide as the Fire tab, so the keys are a fraction closer than on a full-size keyboard, which creates some problems as you can imagine. Still, it's an easy way to type passwords, etc. On the subject of passwords, I am frustrated with the Fire's seeming inability to auto-fill; my Samsung always auto-filled email and mailing addresses, and on the Fire, I am constantly typing those in their entirety. Maybe there's a setting, but I haven't found it yet.All in all, I would say if you are in the market for a 10\" tab, you could definitely do worse than the Fire, but my endorsement comes with the proviso that if you are a regular Google app user, a \"hack\" is in order to make this a worthwhile purchase. Outside of loading the Google store, and my regular email and TV apps, I have not tried to download Chrome yet, so I don't know if it would be problematic or not.A very good tablet for the price...",

                "reviewText": "Just before Christmas in 2021, this item popped up on sale for just $75. We\u2019re an apple family. We have numerous iPads in the house, plus our iPhones, Mac, MacBooks, Apple TV, etc. I\u2019m an audio mixer, and use a product from Avid called the S1. It\u2019s a control surface for Pro Tools that is meant to house a tablet for additional functionality- or eye candy. My older IPad worked, but looked tiny in the cradle, and wasn\u2019t all that useable. I wanted something bigger, but didn\u2019t want to spend the money on yet another iPad. For $75, I was willing to roll the dice.It fits great, looks great, and does exactly what I bought it for.But then I started to explore it deeper. It has built in Alexa with the wake word Amazon. As an audio engineer working from home, I sporadically have actors coming to record. I\u2019ve got Ring doorbells at the entrances, and Echo devices in nearly every room. But for the first time, I can say \u201cAmazon, show me the front door!\u201d, and actually SEE it- and a lot faster than the Ring app on my phone would allow. This was a nice bonus. In fact, in my experience and opinion, Alexa works for much quicker and more reliably than Siri, that I\u2019ve found myself relying on it a lot more. Having Alexa in the tablet to verbalize reminders, appointments, phone calls, etc- all right in front of me, is amazing!I became fascinated with my new toy, and downloaded all the steaming media we subscribe to, plus other apps for news and weather that provide lots of content. I quickly found that I enjoyed watching tv on a 10 inch screen a lot more than on my iPhone. It\u2019s nice to have lunch at the table with my kiddo and share a video we can both easily see and hear. So- this little guy has a great screen and works perfectly for watching shows, movies, YouTube, news, etc.Now- I love my iPhone, and have my music library in iTunes. But when I purchase music, it\u2019s always via Amazon. This is because I get my MP3 files instantly for most albums- but then have a physical disc arrive that often goes unopened. I just like know that HAVE the disc if I ever need to load it again or want to enjoy it in my stereo system. My iPhone can store a decent amount of music internally for when streaming isn\u2019t an option. But I was floored to learn that the HD10 2021 has a micro SD card slot that can store up to 1 TB!!! That\u2019s amazing to me. I can preload entire series, movies, music, photos- anything I need for a long trip or chilling in downtime. For like $25 I added a 400 gig card. Why iPads don\u2019t have this is beyond me.I work with and coach voice actors outside of my day job as a recording engineer. Having that much memory on a tablet and access to an app like WavePad, gives them the ability to record in a pinch while away from their studios. On-screen editing is also fun and easy. I actually added a nifty stylus and case to my HD10, along with a Bluetooth keyboard. It\u2019s essentially a mobile studio, albeit limited.While I haven\u2019t experimented a ton with this- Silk browser (which seems to run on Chrome) allows me to use Source Connect Now to tap into actors or listen to sessions remotely at \u201cCD quality\u201d. Of course you can also use Zoom, Skype, etc.As an apple user, I still want access to my ICloud apps, like Contacts, calendar, Pages, Keynote, Numbers, etc. You can log into your iCloud account and get it all. The trick is to choose \u201crequest desktop site\u201d, otherwise you dead-end at \u201cfind my device\u201d. You can even log into Apple Music via the browser. So all my apple stuff is still with me!I chose Outlook email to run my various work and personal emails and have a unified calendar. It\u2019s perfect for what I need.For $75, I\u2019m finding myself using it more than I have ever used my iPad. It\u2019s the right screen size for me to actually be productive with it, while also having endless entertainment in reach. Add a case, keyboard and stylus- and you\u2019re good to go!",
