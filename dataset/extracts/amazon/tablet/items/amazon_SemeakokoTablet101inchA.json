Fortunately, I was quite wrong. Bought it for an upcoming international trip, as I did not wish to bring my laptop. Screen resolution is great, battery life is superb, and set up has been pretty easy so far. Seems like it will be perfect for my needs, and fits very nicely in my sling bag for carrying. Considering the accessories it comes with, it's a great value, with or without the Prime discount. If you're looking a good value-priced pad for basic entertainment and actvities, this should fit the bill quite nicely. Haven't tried any heavy duty stuff like Excel on it, but willing to bet it won't be a problem.",

                "reviewText": "I recently bought this tablet for my kid who is in middle school so that she can use it for both learning and entertainment. The 10\" Android tablet offers a spacious display, making it ideal for reading, online meeting, and watching videos. Its vibrant colors and sharp resolution enhance the overall viewing experience. Although the outer shell is metal built, the tablet is still pretty lightweight by itself (not including the keyboard and case). The touchscreen is also very responsive.The tablet's camera quality is satisfactory for video calls, Zoom meeting, and some fun photography. The audio output is clear, and Wi-Fi connectivity is quite reliable. One good feature is the expandable storage, providing flexibility for users with varying storage needs. Expandable storage is good enough when we have an extra 128GB SD card for it. My kid can store tons of books and videos on it. The battery life doesn\u2019t last super long but provides sufficient usage on a single charge.The accessories such as keyboard, mouse, and case are perfect for my daughter who uses the tablet for learning. The mouse and keyboard are certainly much better than the touch screen in some cases that need lots of typing. Overall, the tablet satisfies us so far although the price is a bit high as compared to other similar devices.",

The Screen resolution is great, battery life is good. So far, seems perfect for my needs, and fits very nicely in my sling bag for carrying. Considering the accessories, it comes with, it's a great value. If you're looking a value-priced pad for basic entertainment and activities, this fits the bill.",
