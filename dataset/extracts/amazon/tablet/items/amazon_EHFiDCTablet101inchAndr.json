Once that got fixed this tablet is working ALMOST as good as my brand name that was so much more. If you want an inexpensive tablet that runs fine, does what they all seem to do, this is a great option. Clear screen, bright colors, seems fast and smooth. I don't think I have ever bought a tablet at this price. I was providing one to my elderly mother for years as she dropped them often. This is a great purchase although it seems to be not available currently. I hope they restock them. I got this JUST to stream a news subscription that I can't get on television. Serves that purpose as well as many others. Thank you Seller and Amazon!",
