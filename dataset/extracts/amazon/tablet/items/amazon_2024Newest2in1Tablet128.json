                "reviewText": "This Zonko tablet is what I hoped to get and with a name like that at $200 I expected to be disappointed, but I am not. It came in a nice box with all the add-ons, it was easy to setup, and it is reasonably fast. I'm not an Android user but I suspect the difficulties I had have more to do with the operating system than with the hardware. I bought it as a means to move photos from my CFexpress Type A card to an SSD drive, for image storage during a trip where I expect to take over 300 Gb of images. Using a Delkin card reader on the USB-C port it does the job. I put a 512 Gb micro SD card on the provided port. You can format it as internal memory or external. It works well both ways, but it has to be formatted as external memory for compatibility if you will also use it on a PC.I used the micro-SD card to move some movies to the tablet for the trip. It took a bit of work to get the movie format compatible with the VLC video player, but after that everything works.The tablet came charged and in spite of all the work I did I have not recharged it yet, to see how many days I can go without charging. The size and weight are perfect for travel. If I were an Android user everything would have goon more smoothly, but the learning curve was not bad at all.Bottom line - I took a chance and, fortunately, it does everything I wanted it to do well. Very satisfied.",

Keyboard and mouse were very easy to pair. I didn't see anything like screen sharing or mirroring as options, and don't expect any high quality photos from the camera, but the audio when watching videos on YouTube is actually decent.",

                "reviewText": ", they include a keyboard, a mouse, a pen, and case. It also comes with a screen protector pre-applied. Besides all the accessories, the tablet itself has a fast-processing speed and is easy to setup as well as transferring data between devices is easy step-by-step. I would highly recommend purchasing a Zonko tablet for the price and quality it can't be beat. I will definitely look to purchase from them in the future. Their customer service team is eager and willing to help you with any issues that may evolve. As we ran across an issue with my grandson's tablet and they offered us options to resolve the issue and were quick to communicate what they could do. To sum things up, they are a great maker of quality tablets with exceptional prices and excellent customer service. If you are looking for a tablet I would highly recommend giving their products a try.",

Lots of storage, sufficient response speed w the screen. Picture Quality is pretty good Sound is okay. A little to bright & trebley, compared to the Sound & Screen on the Zonko K110. But regardless its a great tablet for the price, feels like a nice little book thats an extension of my phone with the perks of a 2-1 tablet. Highly Recommend !!!",
