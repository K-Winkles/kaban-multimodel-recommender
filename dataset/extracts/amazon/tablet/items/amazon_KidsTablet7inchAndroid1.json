                "reviewText": "The cable in physical appearance in itself is unremarkable. vinyl coated cable that has black plastic covered ends in USB-C and the older USB type connection. What makes this cable better is that it is not merely a charging cable but claims to be also data transfer, which is not available in all cables of this type (like the OEM APple cables, for instance). I needed this kind of cable to communicate and pass information from a newer MacBook Pro and an older Imac. I ordered this because of the data transfer abilities and sure enough, it worked perfectly. A 3-week problem solved by a correct cable. So, if you are looking for data transfer between devices that needs a old USb and a newer USB-C type cable, this is a great buy, it works well and is well-priced!",
