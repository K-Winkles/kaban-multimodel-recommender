                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. For being a tablet that's not one of the major producers, this is a solid device.Product came in solid packaging. Secure, no movement of interior pieces, and was housed within a solid plastic inner container. Nice screen protector over the screen for shipment. Everything opened easily and stays put together well for storage. Slim, compact bezel and profile on the tablet makes it nice to grip without a case. It took a few small tumbles without a case onto carpet without any damage.I have a number of tablets around the house, some name brand some not. This one performed as well, if not better, than most of the name brand ones that are of the same production year. The screen quality is good, displays videos both over wifi or storage without any visual artifacts, tearing, or delay. The wifi is solid, connects to both 2.4- and 5ghz. Bluetooth connected to multiple devices, including wireless speakers and earbuds, without any hiccups or issues. The front camera is good enough for video calls; the rear camera is great for the size.Performance was solid when pushing the tablet to the limits, both with processing image editing and with playing games on it. The battery life was good enough for short, intensive bursts of activity but also good enough to sit and read on for many hours without issue. My only complaint is the branded boot process which adds about an extra 10-15 seconds to the reset/boot time of the tablet.",

                "reviewText": "I tried to take the kid cover off and the whole back of the tablet came off with it. We lost the buttons immediately but snapped the back on and it worked for about a 12 hour drive (THANKFULLY). However after that the battery ran out and it's never charged or turned on again. I missed our return window by about 3 days. (I bought it when there was a coupon and kept it in the box till closer to my kiddos birthday.) So that super sucks. What a waste of money.",

Immediately I ordered mine, started using it on daily basis side by side with my laptop. To my surprise I found myself spending more time with the table than the laptop. I became overwhelmed with this tablet enjoying the wonderful features of Android 13, large memory which I can extend with TF when needed. I am totally satisfied with the awesome large screen, fast browsing, Bluetooth connectivity, vivid colors, stereo sound, long lasting battery charge, light weigh that makes very handy and easy to use in different places.I strongly recommend Lville P11 tablet to everyone.",
