                "reviewText": "I got this on a Black Friday sale for a really good price after reading online reviews, stating that this is super fast, has a good camera and screen resolution. To start, the sound on this thing sucks! If you try to go go just a bit loud, it starts crackling and sounds really cheap. It also has no depth or base. But the main issue is that even after I went to settings and turned off auto update and sleep mode, it still freezes and you have to literally reset it to get it going again. I had to return mine and would never get this product again. I ended up finding an older Ipad and got that instead and never looked back.",

                "reviewText": "I took a chance and I am pleasantly surprised! None of the extras are premium or exotic, but they add up to a complete package and a great one at that!Pros:- Fast and capable - no delays in running all my standard apps. Android 11.- Fantastic storage! Plugged in 1 TB SD card and can take all my files, music, videos, etc. with me everywhere.- Very nice, FHD screen, if not as bright as high-end Samsung or Kindle Fire. Still very nice screen, especially for the price!- Looooong battery life, measured in days vice hours. Claim is 8 hours, but I'm getting better than that by quite a bit.- NO bloatware!- Sounds silly, but came with screen protector already installed and that is a surprisingly excellent perk - no dust or dirt to fight with while installing!- Both 2.4 and 5.0 GHz WiFi are stable and reliable.- Provided cover includes a protective bumper as the tablet mount.CONS:- Included keyboard is not integrated or \"integratable\" with the cover; it's completely separate and standalone. Small, chicklet keys, middling battery life on the keyboard. A little flimsy. But, hey, it's free!- \"Stylus\" is really just a pen with a rubber tip at the other end.- Cameras are just okay.For the current price (with coupon), this is unbeatable! While the extras and accessories may not be high end, they do provide everything you'll need to be up and running for anything you want to do.",
