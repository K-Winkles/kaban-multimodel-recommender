I like that I can schedule out time using the Amazon Kids+ app to make sure that he is doing his learning before his play time on his device. I love that the tablet is protected by the case (my son has dropped it several times and not a single scratch, yet). I love the color and that it\u2019s easy for him to use himself. He can place the back stand up and watch his favorite show, Mini Force without having to hold the tablet all the time close to his face. I love that it\u2019s easy to remove the tablet from the case to clean and to put back afterwards. Great purchase.",

Parental controls don't always control the setting of sound and screen brightness. Have to reset. Lots of monitoring with device to ensure content is appropriate. Overall it does keep him occupied with games on PBS kids and other sites for kids. Keep Alexa off, not needed. Monitor access to internet and block download capabilities.",

Parent controls are very simple too. I will say it was hard to get YouTube kids onto this but I figured it out by watching, well, YouTube (lol). This is so much better than her last tablet and I feel it will last for a very long time. Would highly recommend!",

Its easy for her to operate and knows how to get to her apps etc. This has great learning apps and she loves watching that show Ms. Rachel. My sister couldn't ask for anything more.",
