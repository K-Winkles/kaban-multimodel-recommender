                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I currently use an iPad and have been using it for many years. Have been away from android devices for many years and got this wallet-friendly device for rough use at home especially to play something (videos/games) for my kid and hand it over to him without worrying about it being expensive. My experience has been nice for now. This tablet has decent processing speed and does not hang while using it. I would recommend this tablet in the budget category as it offers enough for the price.My 2 cents below:Pros:- Apps & games: Has plenty of inbuilt games for kids covering fun and education learning both- Parental control: Kidoz app makes it easy to have parental control and it is very easy to use too- Display: 1280*800 HD 10.1 inches size is clear overall. I love how bright these are- Sound: It is loud enough for kid's usage- Processing power: It has a quad-core cortex A53 processor with 2 GB RAM and in my usage experience, I did not see any issue with the functionality. This tablet is decent fast and does most of the job without any lag- Inbuilt storage: Comes with 32GB ROM inbuilt and an external microSD slot makes it more adaptive to storage extension if needed- Battery life: 6000mAh and has very good battery backup. Not as good as my iPad but it lasted between 5-6 hours of usage with half of it playing games and the remaining web surfing- Looks and Design: Sleek design and looks elegant overall. Obviously not as premium as high-end tablets like iPad or Galaxy and has a plastic build but it is very thin and light for a long-usage tablet- Android version & the UI: Comes with the android 12 Go and kudos for that. Also, the user interface is simple and nice- WiFi + Bluetooth connectivity. It has all you would need in an electronic device at this price- Charging: It has a USB-C port and hence par as per the latest standard- Durability: The case makes it very sturdy, hence a safe tablet for kids' rough use. The case arm has a closed loop handle and hence kids can easily hang it in hand and walk- Price: Very reasonably priced considering the features- Warranty: The manufacturer provides 2 years of long warranty on this productCons:- I would recommend getting this tablet for photography as a primary need. The camera picture quality is not very appealing and not impressed by that- I wish some more case color options were available to choose from",

However I chose to give a shot just because opinions differ obviously. Once getting it I found it fairly easy to set up and make ready which I did later at night once my child was asleep for the night. The following couple of weeks I noticed he was struggling to use it and whatnot. Thinking it was his age I grabbed it for a few hours in which I noticed several problems. Most importantly was the 3 times in the few hours I spent with it the \"UI\" feature failed making me have to restart it in order to use it again. Second thing I noticed was how incredibly slow it was when it was actually operating. Load speed on this can take minutes just trying to do even the basic of things with it. I am not one to return many things I just learn and move along in life however I did return this within three weeks and requested my refund. Which of course Amazon did come thru on. Long story short I would find a better brand or model when obtaining a children's tablet.",

Por eso mejor la devuelvo. Ten\u00eda muchas espectativas en ella",
