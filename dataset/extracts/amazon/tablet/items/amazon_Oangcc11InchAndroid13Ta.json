There is also an attractive case provided; stands well in landscape. Would be a plus if it did portrait as well. For me the screen resolution, sharpness, and battery life are just what I need for casual use. I would recommend hghly",

                "reviewText": "The extra RAM makes this run really smoothly, and the 11\" screen is a nice improvement over the 10.1\" screen from my older tablet - see the photo. Screen resolution is very clearThings I've noted:~It seems to weigh about the same as my smaller one~Battery life seems to be comparable to my older tablet, maybe a little longer life. Can't tell for sure yet, as I burned up a bunch while getting it set up.~Android 13 implements MIDI 2.0. Musicians may find it handy, as my Android 12 could hang up occasionally when using a MIDI app. I haven't explored this yet.~Adding a Micro SD card for extra storage went without a hitch.~4 speakers is a little improvement over 2, but I seldomly rely on them.~Note that this tablet does NOT include a keyboard/mouse with it. Not an issue for me, as I'll just pair with what I have.Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase! Android 13 is a step forward without making huge interface changes.",

The tablet is pretty good runs apps smoothly and has all of the right specs that it claims it has the only issue ive had is the storage for the Android system 13 takes 43gb of storage and continues to go up if you download more apps but its not too dramatic of a change Ive downloaded 8.6 gb worth of apps soo far and its went up roughly 13gb but the system I think is catching up with itself because when I look at the app that reads the device specs it says it's taking more storage then what it shows in the system but at the same time if anything happens to the enternals of the device tge device has a lifetime warrenty. If it gets worse I will change my review.",
