Tried to connect this device to the internet and all it kept saying is that failed to connect. I thought I had my password wrong. That wasn\u2019t the issue. I even tried to Bluetooth it from my phone. Nothin happened what so ever. This device will not work at all and the only way for your children to enjoy it unless it\u2019s connected to the internet.",
