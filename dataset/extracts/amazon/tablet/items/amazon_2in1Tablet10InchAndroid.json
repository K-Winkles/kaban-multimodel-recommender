It comes with EVERYTHING, power power adapter, screen protector, sturdy cover, keyboard and mouse. The mouse requires 2 AAA batteries not included, but the keyboard has a built-in rechargeable. It all communicates well together. I got a micro SD card, too, but it's not yet arrived.",

You can download kindle which is a big plus for me. Its light and convenient. Its a little bit slower than I expected, but it gets the job done. You can also download kids apps and use it as a kids tablet.",
