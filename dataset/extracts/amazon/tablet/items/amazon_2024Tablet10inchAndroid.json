                "reviewText": "I purchased the AOCWEI X500 tablet for myself, I am someone who is special needs. I have autism. I decided to go with the one with a pink case.So, the AOCWEI X500 tablet is a budget-friendly option that punches above other tablets I have had in the past.At first glance, I was shocked by the power and features it offers for the cost. The X500 has a 10.1\" HD touchscreen display with vibrant colors and good viewing angles.By the way, the screen looked bigger than I expected. That caught me by surprise but I was also excited about it.The screen is crisp and responsive to touch. Browsing websites is a pleasure on this large display. The tablet is also sleek and lightweight at only 1.3 pounds, making it very portable.The tablet is powered by an octa-core processor and 4GB of RAM, providing snappy performance for daily activities like email, social media, streaming videos and light gaming.Even with multiple apps open, I didn't experience any lag or stutters. The 32GB of internal storage is also generous for the price point.Battery life is excellent - the 8000mAh battery easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use. I was able to binge watch films for hours without needing to recharge.The tablet also comes with a fast charger to top it up quickly when needed.At its low price tag, I was surprised by how well-rounded the AOCWEI X500 tablet is. It delivers smooth performance, long battery life and an excellent screen - everything you need for entertainment, productivity and connectivity on a budget.If you're looking for an affordable, full-featured tablet, this one deserves consideration. I would choose this over any other tablet I had before. This is definitely the best one I have had-hands down.",

                "reviewText": "This tablet far exceeds my original expectations. It's performance is excellent, quick and easy to navigate through. It automatically clears added cache upon closing an app. The battery has lasted me a full day. And vdeo quality is razor sharp. Certainly takes no back seat to my other tablet by a well known manufacturer which costs twice as much. And this one includes a pre-installed case similar to one I had to pay approximately $25 for (the case itself is very rugged, sturdy and comfortable to hold).The AOCWEI X500 deserves the praise it received from other users. I highly recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "So the tablet itself is huge- for the price, I expected a much lower quality screen. It's high definition and very responsive. The included case is pretty tough and it should keep the thing safe despite my kids attempts to neglect it.My only gripe here is the software- it claims to be running android 14 but a lot of software doesn't work properly due to firmware issues, and all my troubleshooting points to this being an older version of android.Hey guys- send me out an OS build that will play the kid's Budge games and I'll up this to 5 stars. Thanks!",

Also, I love the fact customer service responds to your emails very quickly and works to resolve any issues. I would definitely recommend to a friend!",

You can see the screen very well from the sides, even at steep angles, and the touch screen is very responsive.The sound is clear and it can be quite loud if needed. The battery lasts a long time. The wifi connectivity is very reliable, no issues. One great thing with the tablet is that it has 8gb of Ram!, which makes it fast and very responsive. Honest, this tablet is as good as the expensive tablets. There are no compromises here.I recommend removing the screen protectors that comes preinstalled, the screen looks better and you don't really need it.",
