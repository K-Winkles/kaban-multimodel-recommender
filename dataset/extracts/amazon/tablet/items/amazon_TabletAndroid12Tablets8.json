I used it for a couple of games, but mostly for reading, especially when going to the doctor. Now I'm w/o a tablet. Ridiculous!",

It's not even returnable because the cord is missing from the box I put it in. I thought at first it was worth the money, but it's not.Edit: After finding a cord that does work for charging, the battery life does not last as many have claimed. After about 5 hours after pulling it off the charger, it will be down to about 20% if not less and dies within the same day. If you are looking for a tablet even for something small. This one is not the one.",
