                "reviewText": "I picked this tablet up because my iPhone battery was starting to falter, and I use it at church to help control the IP camera. I thought I could use this tablet to take the iPhone's place.Sadly, I fear that even that single usage task would prove too much for this tablet, and I'm not even going to attempt to roll it out on Sunday.Let's put it this way, I had the tablet for 1 hour, and it locked up three times.Three times... while doing nothing more than registering it with Google, configuring it for my WiFi, and setting the local time zone.Should you, for some reason, decide to get this tablet, keep in mind that it defaults to China time zone. It doesn't ask you where you are during set up. It just defaults to China.Speed is acceptable out of the box. Not great, just acceptable. I would expect a new device to be snappy and responsive, but it behaves as if it's been used for the past year and gone to \"questionable sites\".At this price point and quality level, the only legitimate use I can foresee it filling is that of a disposable toy to give to a young child. The kind of device you don't mind if it gets smashed, hurled across the room, or even lost.I'm truly disappointed with this tablet. It fails in every way I can think of.",
