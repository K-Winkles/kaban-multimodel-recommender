I was on it for about 4 hrs yesterday with no noticable drain in battery. an amazing value for the price point.*haven't tested the camera/video quality for chats/virtual meetings yet*for those who care, all audio comes out of one of the longer sides so it can feel odd listening to something when holding the tablet upright. if it's horizontal, it's not noticeable.",

                "reviewText": "This tablet takes such a long time to load apps! And then most of the time it will drop you out of the app for no apparent reason. Runs an old version of Android and doesn't seem to be a way to update it. Plus, only uses 2 gig wifi! Some videos or games run very jerkily. Based my purchase on someone else's good review, but obviously they didn't use it for much! It does have a nice screen, very vibrant. But, it only charges eith the provided charger although a have various other ones.If I knew the troubles this one had I would've spent just a little bit more and would've gotten a much better tablet! Was a waste for my purposes.",
