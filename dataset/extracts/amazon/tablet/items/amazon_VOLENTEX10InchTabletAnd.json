                "reviewText": "I liked this tablet for multimedia due to its high resolution of 1280x800. In terms of battery, I have been able to watch Netflix movies without any problem. Another good feature is that it can be expanded up to 512GB of external memory. Considering the price, it can be considered a good option. However, I wish it was easier to find a suitable case for it. I have bought three cases so far, but none of them fit properly. Carrying it without a case can be risky because of its screen and aluminum back, which can be slippery. In terms of physical condition, it is good overall. One thing they could improve is the volume control, as it is too loud. (I know some may say that's not a problem because other devices have the opposite issue of not being loud enough. It's better to have high volume. I understand that, but try watching the news at night when others are asleep and even when you try to lower the volume, it remains very loud!) Another strange thing is that sometimes it works very well, while other times it can be a bit... let's say \"disobedient.\" Perhaps it is related to changes in internet speed. That's why it's good to share our experiences with it to gather better information.",

                "reviewText": "This tablet works and functions fine, it is not by any means a name brand premium tablet, it is thicker than modern tablet, the speaker placement is not in an ideal location in my opinion, the screen is good and videos look good, this is a budget device and you can tell, however for the price it is a good value depending on what your purposes are for it.It has a quad core processor, however I would not call its usage snappy or fast, videos play fine, games are playable, however it has slight hesitation when starting to load things, or switching to full screen or back to normal size of application players,ect, Just not super fast.Screen looks fine, especially for the price, nice crisp bright display, no complaints.Sound is meh for me, sounds ok if you are in line with speakers, sounds a bit tinny given speaker location and placement, sounds very muffled if you are not in line with them.Wifi works great, no problems there. Bluetooth also working fine.This is a bit thick for me, electronics are getting thinner, which I like, this tablet feels thick to me, some might like this, it has weight and is thicker than more premium tablets I have used.Android works fine, no problems at all there.All in all a good budget tablet that functions fine, would be a good first tablet, kids table, budget tablet, ect.It functions great and gets the job done.",
