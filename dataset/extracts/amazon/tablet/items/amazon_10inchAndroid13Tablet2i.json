                "reviewText": "$100 sure can get you further than it used to when it comes to technology. My Nexus 7 was stolen several years back, which was a basic tablet I used mostly for checking email, browsing light websites, and playing basic games. The K12 tablet pictured here seems to be a decent replacement for it in most ways.First, the screen. While its resolution of 1280x800 isn't Full HD, it is at least IPS which means it does sport pretty good viewing angles. Colors appear fairly accurate, and the backlight gets plenty bright indoors. The screen's topmost layer is plastic, which does not feel good to scroll or swipe with, but it's par for the course at this price point. It'll do to watch an occasional video on, but it's not the most impressive screen I've ever seen, having gotten used to OLEDs at this point. Still, for a budget tablet, it's not too bad.Surprisingly, the K12 tablet supports WiFi 6 networks, as well as Bluetooth (not sure which version). I ran a speed test, and from across our house I managed to pull data at around 100 mbps on a negotiated speed on 200+, so it does appear to support one of the newer networking technologies.The CPU identifier app I used says the SoC is a Rockchip RK3066, which clocks at up to 2.02 GHz. It's a quad core, but on an ancient 40nm process size, paired with a Mali-G52 GPU. All of this is computer nerd speak to say that it's a bottom-of-the-barrel processor. Don't expect to play any high-end games on this thing. I use it for chess, reading Manga, checking email, and not a whole lot else because it isn't really made for much more.There are two cameras, one on the front and one on the back. The back camera includes a flash, but it's so dim it's almost ineffective. These are the kinds of cameras you use in an emergency, when your other devices have died and you need to snap some sort of memory of something happening.I do have to bring to your attention a bit of a misleading stat on this product page. It claims the K12 tablet had 8 GB of RAM. What it actually has is 4 GB of actual RAM, plus what appears to be a user-adjustable amount of RAM-disk or something like it. This is basically a portion of the 128GB of flash storage (a number exactly the same as what the listing says) that is used by the OS like a slower form of RAM. Desktop OSes have something similar called a swap file. The problem is that the SSD on this tablet is much slower than regular RAM, so if you reach the point where the system is using some of this RAM disk, it might be better if you simply closed some apps. This feels like a marketing gimmick - technically, sure, we can say the K12 has 8 GB of RAM. But realistically, only half of it is truly usable (and indeed, the CPU identifier app I used only showed 4 GB of RAM available).There is a microSD card slot to expand storage. I'm thinking of turning it into my offline music player, because it still sports a 3.5mm headphone jack. The K12 is a WiFi-only tablet, as there is no SIM slot nor cellular modem. Not a surprise at this price point.Ultimately, should you buy the K12? Perhaps for a white elephant gift this coming holiday season, or for a kid, or as an ebook reader or music player. I wouldn't recommend it as your main internet-connected device, but rather a standby for when you don't want to do anything too intense and maybe don't want to drain the battery of your regular phone or tablet. Which is basically what I used my last budget tablet for, so in that sense the K12 is an okay purchase.",
