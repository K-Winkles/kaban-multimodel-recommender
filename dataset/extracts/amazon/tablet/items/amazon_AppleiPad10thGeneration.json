                "reviewText": "The Apple iPad (10th Generation): with A14 Bionic chip, 10.9-inch Liquid Retina Display, 64GB, Wi-Fi I bought is such a huge step up from the last iPad we had. Screen response is fast, app load quick and the battery stays charged all day without issues even when watching/streaming video. I went with the blue and it looks really nice.Step up was so easy using my iPhone and it came with the outlet plug and cable to charge it. What I really love is it comes with USB-C instead of the lightning cable. I hated the lightning cable as they always seemed to stop working and on some of our iPads for the kids they don't plug in properly and you have to do some crazy warping of the cable to get it to connect and charge. After about 9 months of using this iPad 10th gen I haven't had any charging or cable issues. So happy about that.The first thing I recommend no matter if you're an adult or it is a gift for a child is getting a screen protector and case put on from day one. It will save you so much anguish if anything happens like a cat knocking it off the coffee table for instance haha.The performance and display are breathtaking when coming from an older generation and the camera is so much better. I've used mine for work, vacationing and giving the kids something to do. We got it on sale, super happy with this Apple iPad 10th gen and would definitely buy again.",

                "reviewText": "This is my fifth iPad and, so far, the best one, yet! It's taking me a little bit to get used to, but, it's not too hard to figure out. The screen is pretty amazing, really bright if you want it to be. I like that the bezels are smaller, I find that the older I get the more real estate my eyes need. Getting rid of the \"Home\" button has taken a little bit to get used to, but, I'm getting there. The speed of the processor is really fast, I've played a few games on it, but, nothing very intense, although, I doubt it would strain this processor. I already had the Apple Pencil 1, for my sixth generation iPad and it works even better on this iPad. I will say that if something happens to my 1st generation pencil, I will probably go to the usb-c pencil, just so I won't have to use an adapter. I did have a little issue getting my stuff transferred from my old iPad, but, that could've been user error. So far, I have no complaints to report, but, I will update if I find any.",
