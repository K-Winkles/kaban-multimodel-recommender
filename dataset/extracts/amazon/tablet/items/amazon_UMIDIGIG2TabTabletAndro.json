                "reviewText": "I'm pretty happy with this tablet, especially considering the price. It's perfect for media consumption. Solid build quality, and it comes with a screen protector and clear silicone case. The screen is big and bright. I really appreciate the long battery life. Setup was fast and straightforward. I had no problem connecting or staying connected to WiFi or bluetooth. I don't have a WiFi 6 router yet, but I plan to upgrade soon, so I'm excited about the WiFi 6 capability.The biggest drawback is the responsiveness. Or lack of. It's not a snappy tablet. There is a few milliseconds delay when I access the keyboard. I tried doing my Duolingo language lessons on it, but the constant delays to access the keyboard and microphone for speech recognition were frustrating enough that I'll opt to use my phone instead. It's probably a very negligible delay, but if you're used to a faster mobile device, it's noticeable.I didn't expect the weight. For comparison, it weighs 576g and the Amazon Fire HD 10 weighs 465g. Not really a plus or minus for me, just something notable.I tried testing its limits by installing a fairly demanding action game (Genshin). Surprisingly, it ran, but unsurprisingly, it really struggled during combat. I'm sure lighter games would be fine.I put in a 128GB SD card, but there is no option to use it as internal storage. Meaning I can't install apps on it, only store files. I see another reviewer saying they're running apps off the sd card, so hopefully its just something I need to figure out.",

Screen protector and plastic case are included in the price as are the charging cable and power brick. Importantly for me, there is a headphone jack. The only minor downsides I saw are that the processor gets a little warm and the battery longevity is only good, not great (as the specs kind of suggested), but a tablet without those downsides would and should cost substantially more.",

I bought it just before my vacation as I did not want to be traveling with my Laptop and I wanted a bigger screen than my phone for emails, browsing, reading news, researching things to do during the trip, and consuming Netflix and other entertainment subscription sources.I almost bought a higher-priced option, but I do not regret buying it at all, the price is exactly right. The specs are very decent, and it makes it perfect for my intended use. It is just what I needed. The speed/performance is decent, and it does not get Hot.I am very happy with the Umidigi G2 Tab purchase, it has Android 13, it can run all the apps I tried, comes with a silicone case included, and has a screen protector installed.I was able to use it during the trip, inside the plane as a replacement for the entertainment systems which planes don't have anymore, and now that I am back, it is a pretty decent backup option when my wife is watching something on TV, and I want to watch something else. I also use it to have news in the background while I am working from home.The setup procedure was pretty easy, and it imported all the installed apps from my phone and installed them from the Play Store. It took a couple of hours to be ready, but no effort was needed from me during that time. Just smooth. I could use it with all my Bluetooth headphones (I have a few from assorted brands).The battery lasts a long time, although I was charging it daily during the trip so I would not be out of battery, I was being extra careful as I believe 3 days would be achievable with my normal use.The 8MP camera (front and back) are decent, but my phone camera is better and convenient, I ended up using the tablet camera just for WhatsApp calls.I did add a MicroSD card I had around to it just to have some extra storage space on it.The only minor detail I found was that I could not charge it with pure USB-C cables. Only USB-A to USB-C worked to charge it, but that is not a problem as one cable and a charger are included in the package. I just used the cable included and any other charger worked as well.Edit: Added a video to illustrate responsiveness.",

                "reviewText": "The Umidigi Tab 2 only comes in one colour, an attractive dark blue. Packaging is simple but effectively protected by dense foam blocks on the bottom and a thin open foam pad on the top. It has a textured back surface that feels good and is non-slip. Screen is big at 10.1\" but there is large bezels. Design overall looks good, but the camera bump sticks out so a case may be a necessity. 2A charger is just adequate for a 6000mAh battery. Speakers are located on bottom of the short side, so sub-optimal for landscape video viewing. Not really suited for high volume listening but there is a headphone jack. Quad core cpu provides okay but not snappy performance. 64Gb of storage is minimal but there is a micro-sd slot. Interestingly Google sees it as a SonyEricsson Xperia Neo V. Overall decent for the budget segment.",
