                "reviewText": "After 30Days+ of constant use it is still working better than advertised. And much better than the two , now DEAD, Lenovo's we purchased around the same time.Again a Great Tablet! It is very FAST with a beautiful bright screen. The location of the buttons makes it much easier to use than others. Solid metal case is sturdy. It even comes with a screen saver already applied. It loaded up and transferred my entire Z fold 4 data and most apps in SECONDS. We've been in business for 40+ years and buy 3 to 6 tablets every month and this one is definitely the best on the market for the money. Would we buy another one? We already did!",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a Android tablet to run torque and Spotify and Google maps in my work truck and still be able to run my work apps as well, I didn't want to spend a lot on a name brand in case it got damaged or lost on a job, overall it works quite well I tried a verizon sim and AT&t sim in it when I first got it, because it only has limited bands in the modem It may not get signal everywhere however I was able to get roughly 20 to 30 Mbps download on either SIM card and 1-5 upload.My only serious complaint is that the GPS module constantly loses signal I even tried factory resetting it and only installing Google maps and when I'm driving the GPS signal will either completely drop out for anywhere between two and 30 mi or it will jump around and constantly recalculate, but then other days it works just fine.That was not a deal breaker for me since it does everything else that I needHowever I probably would not order another one if I needed navigation.Also the IMEI does not register with AT&t or Verizon as a tablet, both systems show it as an unknown device so I had to provide a Samsung tablet IMEI to activate the tablet plan and then insert the SIM card after.Again not a big deal but just something to know.",

                "reviewText": "I read many ratings/reviews on top tablets in search of a good companion for reading downloaded books, watching my favorite movies and shows or streamed music. I purchased the Tooton Android 11 tablet a couple of weeks ago and this far it has not disappointed me. It has all the features I look for, especially when I travel long transatlantic trips to Europe and beyond. It is light to pack (under 2lbs) and heavy with features I love such as speed, size of screen, WiFi, Bluetooth, a phone I can use in the USA or abroad and a better alternative from the dreadful media selections on planes. This tablet is God send for me. It comes with a huge 64GB storage and an SD slot for 128 GB. I can have literally hundreds of movies, shows and books to spoil myself. I am doing it now. Furthermore, this tablet comes with dual Sim cards slots to make and receive calls here and oversees. Contrary to other brands, the Tooton tablet delivers beautifully with crisp screen image, clear sound/audio and amazingly inexpensive. The setting is straight forward; just read and follow the instructions. When you insert the SD card make sure to restart the tablet so that the SD will be read and is visible to the system before usage. I found the customer service on this tablet very friendly, responsive, knowledgeable, and very helpful in working to resolve issues. I will continue testing this baby and will update if needed. To wit, I highly recommend this tablet. It is a winner for me and is well worth my money",

The display and graphics are great. I am still exploring all the inside and outs of it but I really am impressed took hardly no time at all to sync up and put my apps on here as well. It's not heavy or bulky runs pretty well with 4gb ram. 64gb storage with expanding storage as well. It doesn't run hot either while doing multiple things on here and you have 2 sim slots if needed or wanted. One of my favorite things on here is dark mode! So far to me this well worth the price. Great graphics and sound as well.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this only because I needed Android to run automotive diagnostic apps on my car. It was never intended to replace an iPad. Didn\u2019t expect much from Chinese products but was okay because of the limited scope of use. And yet somehow it still under-delivered. Battery life was atrocious. Sitting unused for even 48 hours was enough to fully drain it. Now, just a couple of weeks later it won\u2019t even stay on after charging for hours. Just the Tootoon logo for a second or two then black screen. Returning this piece of garbage.Feb 7: The vendor contacted me and wanted to make it right so they are sending another unit. For the customer service effort, I will add a couple of stars and come back to edit this review after I've used the second unit.Mar 5: Ok, it\u2019s been a few weeks. Still garbage, with a replacement device. Battery life is a failure. You cannot leave this thing off even for a few days or it will be dead. Also, the USB-C port is shallow. Plugs will not all the way in. You end up fiddling with the cable to make sure the connection is good but it\u2019s only a guess. Done with these tablets. Changing my rating back to one star.",
