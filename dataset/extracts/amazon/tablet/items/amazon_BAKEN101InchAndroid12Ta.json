The screen is very good so long as your streaming is clear, it can take a couple of minuets...I prefer to download movies if offered because of this. In all written this is a very good tablet...or have I avoided a LEMMON? ... who knows. LB",

Great grandkids, but after the initial charge The battery did not continue hold a charge. And it\u2019s buried inside the little tablet so I couldn\u2019t take it anywhere and get it working.And I couldn\u2019t return it for my refund, because UPS is my go to Return center, but they would not accept the possibility of a faulty battery for the return and full refund. What does this mean to you the consumer? It means that it w would be like like pulling teeth to get BAKEN to give a full refund. they even wanted me to pay for the shipping to return and given that it was a faulty product. I didn\u2019t feel that was right either. I managed to get the refund, but I spent over an hour, and a lot of hustling with different people even up to supervisor levels being on the phone with people in a foreign country that are difficult to understand, . So if you hear the irritation frustration, it\u2019s because it was even much more than that to get a refund for $47 . $47 may not be a lot to you but it\u2019s a fortune to me as a low income senior and it took me off that I would have to beg and argue that a refund should be given because shipping a faulty battery is a no no and so where is it now It\u2019s in the same box that it came in and it\u2019s in the closet, totally useless. Well, I try to figure out how to dispose of it.",

                "reviewText": "I got this just for 1 app which was webtoon. The colors on this are great. The downside is the battery life. Even when not in use the battery just drops. Only downside honestly.The tablet comes with just the basics to make it run and you do everything else. Which is something that I loved.The blue is bright and stands out which is pretty neat!",
