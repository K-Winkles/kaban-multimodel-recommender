I can browse the internet and plug it into a sound system to stream some music if I'd like, I can watch some TV shows on it and primarily I can read! I got it to read both Kindle Unlimited and through the Libby app from my library and it is great! I love that you can change the color of the screen for nighttime and the battery lasts quite long so during a flight I can get some reading in. The screen is nicely adjustable with the brightness, allowing me to have it super bright if it's day but not blinding when the plane lights go out. You have to taper your expectations because it will not be super fast or anything, but that's what you get for a sub $100 tablet. For that price though, it's impressive and pretty powerful!",

It's fast and durable, though you really should buy a case and screen protector in order to keep it from getting damaged.I would love to see Amazon make these fire tablets with an antivirus application built in. It's nearly impossible to find a decent antivirus app for these tablets.Dislikes:You can't access Google play services or apps on fire tablets. You're able to download popular apps like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Netflix, etc but there have been several apps that I've searched for and can't find on here.Heads up to those spending extra to have their fire tablet without lock screen ads: I spent the extra $15-$20 to get this tablet WITHOUT lock screen ads but every single day (sometimes 2-3 times per day) I have random movies, shows, books and apps appear at the top of my home screen under something labeled \"Discover\" (see photo .) In order to get rid of them you have to long press each one and click on the option 'Not Interested'. There are anywhere from 10-20 of these and it's extremely annoying. While there are no ads on the lock screen I believe this is Amazon's way of advertising on these tablets even though we've paid extra to not see the advertising. I've had another fire tablet WITH lock screen ads and this never, ever happened.",
