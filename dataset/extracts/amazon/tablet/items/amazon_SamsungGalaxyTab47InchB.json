They decided to issue me a refund after a charge for a restocking fee. They claimed that they were able to add a samsung account after a factory reset. Before I sent back the tablet, I was on the phone with Samsung for nearly an hour and could not resolve the issue with a factory reset through the settings options or a hard factory reset. I was able to get a full refund from square trade though. I would not trust buying from the seller overstock planet again.**This tablet is great but I cannot log in and register the device on my Samsung account as the new owner. I get the error \"processing failed\". According to Samsung, this means that the original user deleted their account from the device but did not log into a computer and delete the device from theirsamsung account online. Without the original owner doing this the device is considered stolen and they cannot over ride this. If I were to do a factory reset, the device would be rendered useless because I would need the original account to get past the setup mode. I have contacted the seller and am hoping they can contact the original owner. If not I will need to get this tablet replaced to register as the new owner. I will update my review once the seller contacts me.",

Charges perfectly, connects to Wi-Fi perfectly, functions perfectly, no complaints. Second tablet on the other hand is working fine except for the eissue that when it came to charging it, there is a red x over the battery icon. I messaged the seller and the have good costumer service and replayed within a few hours of me messaging but the only thing I was told was to contact Samsung for more help with the issue. Second table also does not hold the charge for long. I use it and within 2-4 hours I have to recharge it all over again.Other than the issue with the second tablet, the packing was great, delivery was fast and they have good costumer service but I definitely suggest you go ahead and spend the extra money on a new one because although these are certified refurbished, you're pretty much gambling with what you are getting.Overall, I am satisfied but I'm not gonna waste my time returning one tablet or trying to get my money back.",

                "reviewText": "I love this little tablet, I have a larger one that I use more often, and this is great for when I'm on the go. The little one, I'm able to put in my purse and carry it anywhere. Its handy perfect for letting the grandkids play and entertain themselves in the backseat. And it works with the little hands better than big ones.",

                "reviewText": "Tablet is like new very good condition works well I was able to put a 64 gigabyte memory card into it which expanded it around to 72 gigabytes which is perfect for me 8 gigabytes is just not enough considering not all apps can be saved to SD card but that's all good the tablet works great so far so good had it for about a week now........ the reason for my 4 star '''' rating is that it came with a nock off charger that won't even charge my phone just does not work well at all I had to use the old charger to charge it! But still a good deal for the price! Thanks again for your fast friendly delivery and customer service!",

Coupled with extremely poor customer service, I converted it into a hockey puck and purchased two of these refinished tablets. Have had surprisingly good use of these tablets after 6 months of service. No problems what so ever. Exceeded my expectations. Great screen resolution....Excellent storage capacity and powerful processing speeds.",
