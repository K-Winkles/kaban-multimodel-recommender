It's guaged more for folx who are already familiar with tablets and android software so it gave my dad a bit of a learning curve but all is well. The interface is standard and easy to navigate. Plenty of storage for the intended purpose which is mostly just reading and watching videos. Good screen quality and colors. All parts arrived in great condition, nothing was missing.",
