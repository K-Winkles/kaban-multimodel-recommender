                "reviewText": "Although the device looks cool, but it works slow and its GPS doesn't work with Google map. According the description, it should be a powerful tablet. So I tested the device. The results really surprised me. Instead of Android 12, it's a Android 8 device with up to 1GB processing capability. The screen resolution is 1200*800. The battery capability is also smaller. With these numbers, the tablet is a very low level device.",
