                "reviewText": "I needed a travel tablet that I could be rough with, emulate some 6th-gen games on, and use as a laptop replacement for writing and research work, some light music-production sketching, and to watch a few shows on. I went for the HOTWAV R6 because it\u2019s ruggedized, it has a chipset I\u2019m pretty familiar with the performance of (Mediatek 6771), and it has a nice hardware profile and great screen resolution.At the outset, buyers should know that this tablet isn\u2019t lightweight; it\u2019s built to be handled roughly, dropped, exposed to elements and worked hard in hard conditions. It\u2019s thick and hearty, but it feels tough and compact and it\u2019s withstood my abuse during a handful of road excursions. It comes with a durable removable screw-mounted hand-strap that I don\u2019t use but that is a nice option for field users. Mine also came with two removable screen protectors, though the screen is itself pretty scratch-resistant.The picture is really nice: sharp with vivid color and good saturation. The screen\u2019s high resolution makes images, video and text look lively and stand out boldly. Its outdoor performance is the best of any tablet I\u2019ve owned, and it\u2019s totally serviceable as a field tablet in this regard.Performance is great\u2014quick and zippy with no lag or bottlenecks navigating Android or apps, even with numerous apps running. I\u2019ve had issues with lower-specced Android devices showing excessive latency with MIDI devices in music-composition software, but the R6 cuts right through that work.While I\u2019m on the topic of music production, I\u2019ll address the R6\u2019s audio: this is a great sonic performer. Sound is loud but clear, and the stereo speakers have impressed me\u2014excellent stereo separation for a device of this size.Game performance is as-expected for this chipset\u2014upper-mid-range and it\u2019ll run most native Android titles, many at high settings. The most demanding game I ran on it is GRID Autosport, which it handled without issue.Game emulation tops out at Dreamcast for system-wide performance, but it\u2019ll run a good few Gamecube titles and a handful of PS2 with some tweaking. PSP performance is also pretty solid, with only a few of the known demanding titles I tried (the God of War games and a few racing games) wading into unplayable territory.Battery life has been very impressive so far; I\u2019ve been able to go four days on a charge a few times, with moderate use (including game-playing) over that time.SUMMARY: I\u2019m very satisfied with my R6; its performance and utility is on-point for a tablet at its price point, and the fact that it\u2019s ruggedized gives it great value in this range. I\u2019ll recommend it for anyone needing a tough, durable tablet with solid performance and multi-tasking that can be used reliably in non-ideal conditions.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Watch my unboxing and setup video!About a year ago I bought the R5 rugged tablet and I've been very happy with it. Recently I decided to upgrade to the new R6 because of the many improvements that had been made, and I gave my old R5 to my girlfriend.Here are the differences between the previous R5 model and R6 Ultra\uff1a1. Operating system: R5 uses Android 12 and R6 Ultra uses Android 132. Screen sizes: R5 has 10.1 inch and R6 Ultra has 10.4 inch3. Screen resolution: R5 HD+ (1280*800), R6 Ultra 2K screen (2000*1200)4. Storage: R5 - 4GB RAM, R6 Ultra - 16GB RAM (8GB Virtual) + 256 GB ROM, SD Up to 2TB5 The R6 comes with an additional screen protector that was not included with the previous R5 model.The tablet was a snap to setup. When I first bought the R5, I transferred all of my apps and data easily from my Samsung phone to the tablet very easily. It was just as easy to transfer all of my apps and data from the older R5 tablet to my new R6. Everything went as smooth as silk. See my video.* The speed of this tablet is incredibly snappy FAST when using web browsers.* The screen resolution is amazing for watching videos.* The sound quality of the internal speaker is very good, but you can easily connect it to an external speaker.* It has a SIM card slot, and I've got mine subscribed to T-Mobile for Internet access.Durability:This tablet is incredibly rugged and could probably be used by the military under battlefield conditions. Still I am careful with mine because no tablet is indestructible. The R6 includes a plastic adhesive screen protector, a wipe to clean your screen, and another wipe to dry it. Be careful not to overlook the screen protector in the box because it looks like part of the packaging. You'll notice in my video I show the wipes but I don't mention the screen protector. The reason was because I discovered the screen protector AFTER I made the video. :-)The tablet is on the heavy side, but that's because of the huge battery. Also you can use the tablet to charge your phone and other devices.Great tablet, but I have one minor complaint. They really need to add a shoulder strap in addition to the hand strap. It would make it lot easier to carry it while inside an airport when you need more than two hands to keep up with all of your other stuff.Overall, I'm extremely happy with this tablet and will most likely buy another upgraded model in the future.",

The Hotwav R6 Pro feels tough, love the handstrap to keep a better grip on it, its a bit on the heavy side but thats ALL BATTERY! Initial 6 days of constant upgrades and uploads of my data and apps, I installed a 512GB microSD card and my cell phone carrier's SIM card, calls are crisp and clear on speaker and on my bluetooth headset that I normally use and it was still at 60% battery! Video and pictures are crisp and clean, and GPS data is one of the most accurate I have seen in a phone or tablet!No need for a manual, startup was a breeze following the on-screen prompts, Android 12 was a bit of a learning curve for me but its all there with some newer stuff new to me. What few questions I had were quickly answered by Hotwav Customer Service via e-mail, they're one of the best customer services I've seen, very fast replies! I'm very happy and will be watching to see what else they come up with next!",
