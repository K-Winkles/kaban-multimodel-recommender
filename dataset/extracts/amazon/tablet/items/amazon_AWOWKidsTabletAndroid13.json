It would say it was charging but never actually would despite using different chargers. Contacted AWOW customer service and received a message back from Martin within a few hours. After troubleshooting the tablet, he told us to send it back to him and he would send us a brand new replacement. We received it today and it is the exact same tablet. Very happy with the product and the customer service is amazing. Thank you so much, Martin!",

My second tablet they replaced my baby girl was sitting in her chair it fell and hit the corner of the case protector and fell on its back again the screen cracked, I would buy this tablet either for me or my 16 year old but for my 3 year old nope mind you the second tablet I had bought a screen protector and it still cracked, I took out the screen protector to make sure it was just the screen protector that cracked and nope it was the screen that cracked as well. Honestly like I said I would buy it for my 16 year old or myself..",
