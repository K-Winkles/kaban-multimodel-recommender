The battery was at 96% health when it arrived which is also shockingly high for a renewed device.There hasn\u2019t been any issues with using it either. It setup just like a new device right out of the box. No problems with low quality screens, the touchscreen works flawlessly, and all the buttons have the snappy new feel to them still.The only way I could tell the difference from this iPad to a brand new one is the box it comes in, and more importantly, the price I paid for it!",
