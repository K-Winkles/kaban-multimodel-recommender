                "reviewText": "Right out of the box the device came fully charged. It was rather easy to set it up. Of course, you do need your WiFi password and email address to download your previous unit, if you have one. Overall, so far, it is a very good machine. I played a streaming video on it, and it played flawlessly. I was impressed. I also downloaded a music player to play my music on the device. That took some doing. The download of my music from my computer had to be done via a cable and you need to format within the machine, an SD card, if that is where you want to store your music. Recommend you copy and paste en mass your music library and SEND TO the SD card on the tablet. Once everything was downloaded, using my downloaded player, everything played well. Unlike a previous machine, everything remained MP3 format.One small drawback it the charging rate. It seems very slow. There may be a setting I've missed but if this is the only drawback I find, this will be a very good machine to use.We will see about the durability of the device as time goes on.",

                "reviewText": "I received this tablet yesterday and have had a lot of fun, and a little frustration too, getting it set up. I have a Kindle Fire 10.1 Plus that I've \"jail broken\", I guess is the term, in an effort to access Google apps. I actually have two other sized Fires which are both jailbroken. I've found that each size Fire reacts a little differently to the jailbreak, and they're not always happy. What I've been wanting is a fully Android tablet that wouldn't break the bank account, and this tablet seemed to fit the bill. It was a little tricky to get it to connect to my wifi during set up. I live in a studio apartment so my wifi signal is quite strong for any of my devices to access. I used my phone's hotspot data to proceed with the setup, which worked fine. It took a while to set it up because I downloaded the apps from my phone's Google backup...after I did finish the setup I attemped to connect to my wifi, and somehow it did. I don't really know how or why, but it finally worked, and no problems so far staying connected. This tablet is pretty much as fast as its Fire counterpart, the audio is fine (I tend to use headphones though and it's better), but the screen resolution is not as good as the Fire. It's sufficient for my general purposes, and if there's something I want to watch at a higher resolution I can use the Fire. I wish the power was a bit slower to discharge, it's not as good as the Fire's. It charges fairly quickly though and using it plugged in is no problem for me. It makes me a little nervous though because it seems to heat up a little more when charging, when compared to the Fire. I'm using it with a rotating universal case which holds the tablet away from the hard back case cover a little so heat can escape and it doesn't warm up as much. It's accepted most of the apps I've downloaded, and they all seem to be functioning well. It had no problems accepting the 64 gig micro sd card I inserted as well. All in all, this tablet has certainly been worth the money so far, and if you're not expecting an iPad, or even a Fire, this tablet is fine. I can tell you, it's nice to have a straightforward and clean Android interface to work with! I'm a longtime Fire user, and I get tired of the Fire's bloated screens that Amazon forces you to navigate. If things head south with this tablet I'll update this review, but until then I recommend giving it a try, it's a bargain at the price.",

Battery seems good with how long it lasts and charges quickly. But it will not charge with adapters that aare meant for fast charging such as oneplus super chargers.Screen looks well, plays 1080p content perfectly fine. Wifi 6 is true but it uses a budget chip. So maybe up to 300 or so Mbps speeds with wifi 6 router. Google Play works fine.My kids play roblox literally just fine with it as well with Minecraft. Rarely shows a lag.Sound is adequate and can get loud.So far for us it haas worked perfectly fine.Perfect case for this tablet and different colors.

The battery life it\u2019s nothing to write home about though. and if you\u2019re used to an iPad or Samsung tablet, you\u2019re gonna have to relearn this thing bcz it\u2019s really really basic, kind of like 15 year ago phones were. I hated it at first when I was trying to learn it and I was going to send it back but then I gave it a chance end it does what I needed to do and it was the least expensive tablet I could find that had a big screen. I can\u2019t get over the colors on this it\u2019s wonderful The graphics are amazing! I love that it came with the case and it\u2019s a really nice cases that you can prop it up with as well.I actually changed my review to one star because when I asked for the code to the $10 free Amazon coupon that the seller offered for buying this tablet, the only reply I got was them telling me to give them 5 stars instead of my original three. I did ignore their request and demanded the $10 code to which they did finally send to me.",
