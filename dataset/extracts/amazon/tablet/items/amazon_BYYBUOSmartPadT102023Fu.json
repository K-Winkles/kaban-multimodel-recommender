Since it wasn't going to be used for games, I didn't need the most powerful tablet on the market and could save money. This tablet worked really well.I booted it, updated it, put it in service, and was really impressed with how well it worked. Full Android, not that 'GO' version that is crippled. It ran all the software I wanted and has a nice bright display that can be seen across the room. The touch screen is glass, not plastic that cleans easily when you touch it with cookie dough on your fingers.It has been on continuously for a month or so now and never failed. I have implemented a slideshow screensaver so it also serves as a picture frame when not actively being used. I even mounted it in a wooden frame so it looks nice on the wall. It's become a very useful part of the household.I don't know about the gaming capabilities, but the horsepower in this device is more than I need for its intended purpose. I will probably buy another for another location in the house. For example, it would be nice to have parts lists, assembly diagrams, and other instructions in the garage when working there; or maybe movies in the tub while soaking a sore back.Nice device and not overhyped at all.",

They are 3gb RAM with 64gb internal storage and there is expansion for SD/TFIt is only wifi, and is android 11, however battery life is exceedingly long even when kept with screen on and high brightness all day, running a few apps for work. Sound is nothing special, and display can be a bit dim on some view angles but i got one of these and two other higher grade tablets on the market and both of the higher end ones have been pieces of junk and hardware issuses / turns into a paperweight. This tablet had half of their ram capacity yet kept the pace when those machines even functioned correctly. I have since returned those others and got more of this model.seems like a nice solid aluminum body as welloh and the camera is pretty crap, wouldnt put any bets on this being anything more than a general purpose / workdesk tablet that sticks to light multi-tasking for a full days battery life no sweat.",

Then I found this tablet..it said all the same things as the ones I looked at before. But it is exactly what it says it is. I recommend this tablet 100%.FYI: I've only had it three days so I hope I'm still this certain a few months from now:)",

                "reviewText": "From a little known company comes what is perhaps the greatest bargain 10\" Android tablet you can buy.I was a bit skeptical about this unknown brand but after reading reviews and checking specs I decided that its was worth a go, and I'm glad I did.My trusty Lenovo TB-X705F was starting to show its age and struggled to play any of the more modern demanding Android games like Northgard and XCOM2 Collection and I found my S20 just didn't have the screen real estate to do those justice. This has been the near perfect replacement and realistically lives up to the hype of the glowing 4 and 5 star reviews.The MediaTek 8183 CPU & Mali-G72 MP3 GPU (AKA Helio P60) provide enough oomph for a great tablet experience. Considering this is the same chipset used in the Amazon Fire HD 10 (2021) which is often recommended as a good mid range gaming tablet but with full access to the Google Play store catalog; & you've got yourself a winning combonation.Aesthetically the tablet is solid. And I do mean literally. Its not what one would call a 'cheap' feeling device, rather its devoid of anything plastic that might have implied its entry level cost. Its vibrant 1920x1200 screen and metal back add up to a pretty hefty weight which might be off putting for some but I personally don't mind it at all.Gaming performance was largely positive and I had no trouble running Asphalt 9 Legends, Northgard and most popular emulators. Game streaming with Xbox GamePass & Steam Link were both positive too and I've not hit any issues with WIFI connectivity as others have complained about. Its WIFI performance is better (IMHO) then my older Lenovo tablet.However, it did not have quite enough power to run XCOM2 Collection. Unfortunately that game just tends to crash whereas my Samsung S20 can play it without issue, so you'll probably be able to play most of the games out now, though some more demanding games may still be out of reach. Overall though, considering the price its still a winner. Gaming is largely a positive experience and the tablet stays cool and quiet throughout hours of gaming sessions.My primary knock against this would be that the 60hz screen does tend to feel a bit pedestrian after using the Samsung S20's wonderful 120hz screen. Its not a dealbreaker buy any means, games are still enjoyable; but anyone one who's gone from 60hz to 90hz or better will know the difference. Still for everything else, reading or media consumption its more then enough. Also the placement of the headphone jack (on top) seems a bit odd but nothing BT headphones won't easily make a non issue. Last, it runs Android 12 which is great but support and updates remain an unknown, only time will tell.Overall this is a steal of deal. It'll likely beat out more expensive tablets with Unisoc T6xx processors lower screen resolution and give you a similar tablet experience to the Amazon Fire HD 10 (plus access to the entire Google Play catalog)For those who are ingrained in the Amazon ecosystem the Amazon Fire HD 10 maybe the better device but other then app catalog and obvious design differences its really a coin toss.",
