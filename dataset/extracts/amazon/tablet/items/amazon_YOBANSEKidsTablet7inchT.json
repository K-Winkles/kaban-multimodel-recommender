                "reviewText": "This tablet is somewhat easy to setup. To get the best benefit from the standard installed apps, it is worth paying the $17 for a lifetime subscription to the tablet software for use in almost every standard app installed. You can install other apps, but they are worthless unless you purchase a no ad option.The charging takes forever, so if the battery dies (usually get about 5-6 hours of constant use like YouTube Kids) per charge, so be ready to have other things available, especially when on long trips. It also takes a long time to boot up, but that isn\u2019t really an issue for me.The screen is bright, but the screen protector has a lot of bubbles. I am very proficient with installing screen protectors. I was able to work most of them out, but there are still a few on the outside edges, but they don\u2019t interfere with use of the tablet.Overall, I am pleased, I just wish it charged faster.",
