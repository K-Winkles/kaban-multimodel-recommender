I now leave it on constantly since it is such a hassle to get it to turn off and turn back on again. I subtracted one star from the rating.11/29/2023 edited to add: the seller contacted me and graciously refunded the cost of the tablet and I am adding the subtracted star to my rating. I reset the tablet to the original settings and the power button problem continued. I wonder if it is an intermittent hardware fault but I am no longer using it.

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars It's a fair price for \"pure\" Android",
                "reviewText": "The last time I tried a generic tablet was at the onset of the tablet revolution around 2012 or so - and it was not good. A decade later, the technology has evolved to where even a generic can be useful for basic tasks. My mother has a Fire HD 8 Plus 2020, which she uses to browse the Web. The drawback of an Amazon tablet is that the OS is proprietary, aimed to promote their own goods and services, which I think would be tolerable except for the fact that \"proprietary\" means any Android app has to be adapted for use in the Amazon app store, and there are simply not enough apps adapted. Yes, all the \"major\" ones are, but if you want to use something particular like the HEB grocery store app, the Amazon tablet doesn't support it. HEB is not some obscure niche interest, it's the biggest grocery retailer in Texas. Texas is big, but not big enough for Amazon apparently. So, I've been contemplating getting my mother a \"pure\" Android tablet.I let her try out this one, but she says \"it's too heavy\", which she also said about the Samsung she tried, which is curious because this tablet, the Samsung, and the Fire HD8 Plus 2020 are all equivalent in weight. The listing for this Topsand says \"662 grams\" but that's got to be the weight of the package, the tablet itself weighs in at 359 grams, the HD8 Plus 2020 at 355 grams, and the Samsung Tab 8.4 2020 the lightest at 309 grams. And my mother's Fire is even heavier by about 150 grams because of the case. But I guess she likes the way the weight is distributed, even though all three tablets appear to have the same 8x5 dimensions.Weight issue aside, the fact of the matter is that this Topsand is equivalent, in specs and in price, to the Fire HD8 Plus 2020, but you get \"pure Android\" (and OS 13). You could try getting the 2022 HD8 Plus, which has a 30% faster processor, and wireless charging. But it's more expensive. Then again, you could try for a refurb at around $90. Or, you could get a Samsung Tab 8.4, which is 2020, but has both a better resolution (1200x1920) and a better processor (octa-core) and while a new one is $130, you could easily find a used one for about $75. However, the Tab 8.4 is only upgradeable to Android 11. Is there a reason you might need Android 13? And some people are more comfortable with lower resolutions.The other problem with a generic is that if you really want a case for it, you only have generic options. My mother has the case specific to her tablet, and I always use Otterbox for mine.",
