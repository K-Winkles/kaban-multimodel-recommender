Well turned it on and it was slowwww like my internet is amazing and this wasjust pure snails pace but whatever got it set up then noticed the charger it came with was broken (the metal piece that goes in the charger was off) luckily I had chargers well then we turned the volume down it never went down \ud83d\ude33 even at the lowest setting and it sounded weird like it wasn\u2019t coming from the speaker it was loud but muffled? If that makes sense, the color of the screen seemed really off (it was the blue shade) it was just off, then I look into the charger port and the piece inside is broken like crooked so thankfully it was fully charged when it came but I couldn\u2019t charge it anyways\u2026well now we\u2019ve gotten to the end I contacted Amazon thru the chat system they made me go through all this reset stuff which I get for their end to say they tried (even though the charger port was broken) well finally the women gave me step by step how to contact seller. I did they sent me a replacement fast but here\u2019s the new updateNEW UPDATE!!This new tablet is horrible!! Package was broken and unwrapped like they gave me a refurbished one, it was dead when I got it and it won\u2019t connect to my internet at all! I can\u2019t do anything with this and on top of that the volume is still messed up. I want my money back this is the worst!",

                "reviewText": "My old tablet was 10\" - this is 10.1\" but it seems larger in comparison - less frame around screen. I'm still in the process of figuring it all out - some things are easier than others to get set-up, but I'm getting there. The one thing that is frustrating is the volume - I'm constantly lowering it but apparently the unit has a mind of its own and raises the volume all the way. It is so loud that I can hear it all the way across the house. At night I have to power it off - it has startled me in the middle of the night when a message came through. Hoping the mfg will have some sort of solution to the volume issue. Can't say anything about battery life since it's powered off at night, touch screen seems okay, but the flimsy case it came with is a joke. Can't get it to stay in the upright position - just keeps collapsing.",
