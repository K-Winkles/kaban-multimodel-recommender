Some apps are not compatible - apps that normally would be compatible with android go edition example - Hay Day. Crashes immediately. It\u2019s super slow with games and I have beasty WiFi. Some games you can\u2019t play because it\u2019s so slow. A lot of regular settings aren\u2019t available. I would suggest doing your research on android Go Edition before you buy. Other than that the screen is pretty clear - no funky reflection issues like other cheap tablets. Pretty light weight and the battery lasts a good while.",

                "reviewText": "It does work. not a strong Wifi card, sometimes video/audio works, sometimes only video, sometimes only audio. Very slow operation but it does work. the more apps you download, the slower it gets. We purchased this for my mom to be able to video chat with our kids on Google Meet/Duo, Zoom, and any other app we tried. Was not good enough to depend on. Had to go another route. Works perfect for simply getting on the internet or as a note/calendar keeper. Unfortunately, I don't recommend this unless you are simply wanting to use it for browsing the web.",
