I kept an open mind and am very pleased by its performance, screen quality, speed, and ease of operation. Seriously, I love it. I use it everyday. Certainly would recommend it to anyone. I use it on our house wifi and I can zip around the internet very easily.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I purchased this tablet to replace a 21/2 year old, $800, Apple Air Pad. I was so outraged by my very gently used iPad simply dying, I refused to consider ever buying Apple again.I had not had an android tablet before the purchase of this Colfan 10.1 inch tablet.I obviously went for a bargain tablet.I\u2019m very happy I did so.It handles all of the applications that I regularly use (Gmail, Word, Excel, etc.)It also makes for a terrific media device.No wifi problems, no Bluetooth problems (other than the ones created by Apple when pairing AirPods with anything other than an Apple product).This tablet is not super fast, but plenty fast for the uses I\u2019ve described.The price was 1/10th the price of my AirPad, the performance is about 90 percent.The only big difference is battery life.The Coolfan has about a 3-4 hour life between charging.This is not an issue for me.I would definitely buy this tablet again.",
