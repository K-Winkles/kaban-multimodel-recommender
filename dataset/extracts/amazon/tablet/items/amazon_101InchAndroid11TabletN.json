It wouldn't stay connected to the internet, wouldn't let me download some apps and was lagging but I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement. Thus far I haven't had much of an issue with it besides the battery life isn't the best but it doesn't die in just an hour of use either. I had no issues connecting to the mouse or keyboard. It's on the heavier side but does look very nice. It didn't come with instructions which I felt was odd but it came with a guide on connecting the mouse and keyboard which is pretty standard on how you connect any bluetooth device.",
