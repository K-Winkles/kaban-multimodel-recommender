                "reviewText": "I bought this for my 11 year old for our trip (from the U.S.) to Europe. The quality is great for the price. It's definitely better than inclusiveness (and inappropriate ads) that we noticed with the Kindle Fire tablets we'd bought our kids in the past. There are only 2 issues I'm that aware of with this tablet.(Issue 1) While traveling, we weren't able to sign into one of the hotels' guest Wi-Fi network. The tablet doesn't pop up with the sign in page after you connect to a guest Wi-Fi network (unsecured, but then opens a sign in page after connecting). All of our other phones and devices had no issues.With most of the networks, I could open the browser and go to the default router network IP address, and that would force the sign in page to come up in the browser. However, that method did not work at one of the hotels where we were staying for a week. We even took the tablet to a restaurant and used their unsecure Wi-Fi network to make sure his tablet was updated to the newest version.On the third day at the hotel, he told one of the hotel employees about his issue, and they were nice enough to sign him into their actual employee Wi-Fi network.(Issue 2) We can't seem to find an Auto Adjustment option for the Brightness on the tablet. If he was inside, he would have the brightness lower, but then when he'd take it outside during the day, you couldn't see the screen to adjust the brightness so you could see it outside. Again, we did ensure we were on the latest software version while we were on the trip, so this is a current issue at the time of writing this review.I'm hoping they'll fix both issues in a future update. They're definitely not big enough issues to make the tablet not worth purchasing... just an inconvenience/annoyance. Both issues are software related and not hardware, so they are fixable issues.",

She also loved decorating it with the provided stickers. The sound is great also. We are still playing around and testing out all the features, but this was definitely a home run. The whole family loves it. In addition, it comes complete with a protective cover that has a built in stand, making it something that will survive tiny, messy, clumsy hands. Great quality.",

The charging cable attaches at the top which I love. I've had it almost 3 weeks, have used it daily and it has performed with perfection. The second photo is the 10 inch tablet in my old 8 inch holder. It's definitely worth the price over the big store brands.",

                "reviewText": "The biggest thing that impressed me with this tablet is it's capability to expand it's memory to one terabyte. It was super impressive coming in 120 gig of rom, but to be able to expand it 1 terabyte meant it was the most powerful tablet I know of. It is able to process all of that without slowing down, and I don't have to worry about running out of memory. I can actually use it as a major computer without any worries. A convenient small computer that does the job of a large computer.",

This tablet has an amazing processor on it which allows me to play any of my video game emulators and input code at will. There's plenty of storage on it to download whatever I want. I would recommend this tablet for anyone looking for a great quality tablet.",
