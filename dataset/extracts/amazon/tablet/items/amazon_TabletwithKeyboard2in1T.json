My teenage uses her tablet to do all her schoolwork, and uses the mouse and keyboard regularly in order to do her assignments. Then she turns it back into a tablet to read, to watch shows, to play games. So far it's had no limits to what she can do with it. She can use it all day at school, come home, and not have to charge it until she goes to bed, and even then the charge is still good, she just likes it to be full for school.

We bought it for one purpose only, to use as a portable monitor for our home security system. Literally to run one single app. The battery life is non-existent and was dead within 2 hours. The image is extremely pixelated and you cannot make out anything the eight security cameras are showing on the single screen, however we can view the security camera images on our phones and the TV it is hooked up to Crystal Clear. I can't believe we bought a tablet for the sole purpose of running a single app and it could not even do that. It feels like a heavy duty expensive chromebook, don't waste your time or money. Especially for my people with disabilities and Mobility issues, don't even waste your time because you will have to find a ride to the UPS Store to return the darn thing the next day.",

They haptics to the keyboard are extremely slow. I can type a sentence and be done and it\u2019s still typing on the tablet screen. It\u2019s very low quality. However the tablet in itself is great for now. I will revisit if anything changes with an update.",
