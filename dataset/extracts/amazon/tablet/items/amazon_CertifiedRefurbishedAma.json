                "reviewText": "I can't recommend this product enough! You'd never know that it wasn't brand new and that it's a refurbished product.I got this for my soon to be 3-year-old sons Christmas. I've been using it and setting it up for him and have had no issues whatsoever. This was an awesome choice for a first tablet for him because it was half the price of the kids fire 7, and there are tons of kids cases on Amazon that you can purchase to turn it into a bigger version of the kids Fire 7 except bigger and for a fraction of the price.I always buy my kids fire tablets, my 17-year old and 14-year-old kids also got fire tablets for Christmas as their first devices when they were 3 and 6 and they loved them.They really are a perfect choice for kids who are a little younger. I don't see the point in buying an expensive tablet for a toddler or young child when these work just as well and I actually prefer them for kids for several reasons, not least of which is Kids+ and the ability to link everything with my Amazon account so easily. We can access their Kindle books, the shows they like to watch on prime, and everything else. I like the parental controls as well. It's just a really seamless experience for a first tablet or device for a child. I can set limits and enforce quiet hours while still having something portable to take on errands and trips and for his limited screen time at home. He loves to play learning games on my phone and read books on my Kindle as well as watch Monster Jam and dirt bike kids videos on YouTube and watch his shows. So I know he'll be so excited to unwrap his gifts on Christmas morning to find that Santa has brought him the \"big phone\" he asked for.",
