                "reviewText": "Got this for my 3-year-old so she could watch movies and TV shows on it. It's small enough that she can carry it around on her own, the integrated stand is perfect for when she brings it to the table, she's able to use it completely on her own. Adding apps to it has been no trouble and although you're able to supervise it with an adult account we haven't really had to. It charges quickly and although the battery isn't going to last all day with watching movies, it's good enough to watch a couple of complete films and then go for a charge. Even with that being the case it's fine to just plug it in and continue using the tablet. Would buy again.",

It works great and is able to support a wired headphone which doesn\u2019t need to be recharged like the wireless ones the iPad has to have. My daughter is almost 5 and has no problem working it on her own. The speed and memory are good without frustration from my kid. The kickstand is nice also. The price is amazing for the quality. My only complaint is the ads on the android games but that has nothing to do with the actual tablet.",
