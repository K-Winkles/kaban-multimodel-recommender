                "reviewText": "After several years of owning various Amazon tablets, I wanted to try something different. I was looking to get away from the \"Amazon centric\" ads, promotions and so on. I also was hoping to link my tablet to my PC, so that I could do more remotely. I did a good amount of research and decided upon this Samsung tablet. I have a Samsung cell phone, so I thought I would like the added convenience of linking that as well. I was very happy with the slightly larger screen compared to my Fire 10 tab, I liked that it was thinner and felt comfortable to hold. Upon receiving it, I followed the instructions and linked my phone to it. Basically, I wound up with a larger version of my cell screen and a download of the compatible apps. Unfortunately, my carrier doesn't provide service for a tablet, so I didn't have that available. I also didn't really want my tablet to mirror my cell phone. So, I returned to factory settings and started over, backing up the info before I did the reset. I started over, but found as soon as I tried to restore the apps and info I'd backed up, it reset my phone to reflect the tablet. Also, not what I wanted. I then tried to link it to my PC, which also did not work. Now, to be honest, I'm not a techie so this may be all my fault. However, not to be discouraged (I really wanted this tablet to work for me!) I did another factory reset, this time bypassing the restoration of any previously installed info or apps. After reloading apps from the Play Store, I thought I was ready to sail along smoothly with my brand new tablet. Not so fast! The internet response was sluggish, the screen was ultra sensitive, the battery took longer (than my Fire 10) to charge and seemed to run out quicker. I found it more difficult to use my Prime membership, with more steps needed to purchase books, watch movies and just get to my account. I think the Fire tablets spoil you in the ease of accessing everything Amazon. So, I sent this tablet back. And, because my husband (who never wanted anything to do with a tablet) discovered how much nicer it was using my old tablet to play solitaire and watch videos, instead of this cell phone, I am ordering a new Fire 10 for myself! This is one person's opinion, and I'm not saying the Samsung Galaxy A8 is a bad tablet, but if you've been using Fire tablets for any length of time you may want to stick to that brand. Otherwise, I am sure this tablet is fine for people not wanting the Amazon link-ins, like the slightly larger and thinner screen, and the advantages of using the Google Play Store. Additionally, my cell phone and PC are on the older side, as technology goes, so with a newer PC, cell phone and different cell service- you may be able to have success where I failed!",

                "reviewText": "I use the Galaxy Tab A8 on stage and rehearsals for reference for songs (chords, sheet music, lyrics, etc). It can do more, but I'm not trying to push this to it's limits for what I need the screen to be on all the time for shows...although I will use it as a sleep/white noise machine for sleep on occasion (wish YT allowed for screen off but maintained audio, but that's TY for ya)...It is what I was expecting.. a very good quality and performance for a mid ranged tablet. I would've gone with a smaller footprint tablet, but those were underpowered, and the screen was a lot worse that this. It's not trash, but I'd be paying Tab S8 money for a larger screen...I'm not looking to add weight to a mic stand mount to have it tip over, so this fit the bill.Screen - as I mentioned, the screen is not trash. Looks rather smooth considering. Could be better in the brightness department as well, but this is because of the type of display that's used. Think older LED tv's to a 2K computer monitor. It's slight, but noticeable. I compared this to a mentioned S8. This is what you're paying for that (amongst other things). I'm okay with this compared to the price vs the S8. Like I also mentioned before, I would've gone for the smaller footprint, but trade off is a slightly worse screen for it's size, and the weight and performance (the 64bg and 128gb variant has 4G RAM, compared to the 32gb storage variant having only 3gb RAM).Weight - compared to the S8, this wins the weight ratio to size for lighter tablet (even with a spigen lightweight case on this thing).Performance - This is where the added RAM is helpful. My lead guitarist has this same tablet in the 32gb version, and the added ram is a super helpful when opening the PDFs for songs and lyrics while having the setlist up on the other half of the tablet for the split screen. Especially when leaving the screen timeout to never and having the brightness down enough to not be bothersome on stage to anyone else. It was a bit snappier when I compared it to a head to head test between the 2 (I adjusted the screen animations in Developer Options). It brought up several PDF's up a tad bit faster, but you can definitely make due with the 32gb, but I'd rather have that room for the PDF's and probably songs I've downloaded for reference on a 512gb microSD card and allow for the performance on the tablet not be bogged down by the tablet being full of files. I've also used this as a touchscreen mouse pad for a laptop connected to my TV as a HTPC via Bluetooth. I prefer a keyboard and trackball for this, but in a pinch, this using an app helps. No lag or problems.Speakers - I do use this as a sleep machine when I need it, and it does help me. It's loud, bordering on annoying in a bedroom. But I've had no issues with the audio on it using as a browser, multimedia device, and using headphones (wired or wireless, via the headphone jack, Bluetooth, or dongle). Also I've adjusted some things in Dev Options for this as well...so no issues.There's not a whole lot to say for this for what I use it for...It has worked flawlessly, so there are no regrets. This is a great little device.",
