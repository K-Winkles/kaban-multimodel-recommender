Its not blazing fast but its decently fast and it does have 2gb ram 32gb storage with Unisoc 8 core SC9863A, which is a little dated by 4 years. Haovm did a decent job with this tablet, but they needs to focus on updating the hardware with the same size 9in screen they should add 3gb ram and 64gb storage and use T310 or newer processor. Comes with Android 10, 32bit instead of 64bit system. That may not be a big deal but to use the full potential of the CPU and to get best performance your better off using 64-bit android because the CPU is a 64bit capable.",
