                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I bought this tablet several weeks ago for a trip I was taking. Because I was going to be flying, I didn't have space to carry my heavier laptop, so I opted for this very lightweight tablet. I looked around at several brands, as I usually stick with name brands. And I wanted something a little beefier in the memory department. But I didn't want to pay a huge amount of money for something I was just going to use for games, reading emails, and surfing the net. I had never heard of Toscido, but I liked the specs on this one and I really liked the price. After scoping out reviews in multiple places, I decided to give this a try and crossed my fingers that it would be fine. I am so glad I made the choice. When I received the tablet, it was more than halfway charged already, so it didn't take long for it to reach 100% when I plugged it in. I then proceeded to download all the games and ebooks I planned to use on it. I tend to play match 3 type games along with adventure puzzle-type games and word/object search. While they may not be as graphically intensive as some of the higher-level games that require a lot of juice, the ones I play still have some pretty decent graphics. This tablet handled them without any problems. I was especially pleased when playing the adventure escape games and object search games. I had no problems connecting to Wi-Fi networks, including my mobile hotspot, for which I was immensely grateful.The battery lasted a good while. On the last day of my trip, I started at 100%. I went through three different airports and flights periodically connecting to my mobile hotspot, and playing my games. When I got home, I turned off the tablet and put it to the side. The video I've included with this review was taken almost four weeks later. In the video, I've tried to show how long it takes to initially power up. It also shows that four weeks after all-day use, the battery is only down to 40%. That's pretty amazing, in my opinion.The tablet came with a nice little Bluetooth keyboard and a tablet cover. I opted to buy a different keyboard that folds since the one that came with the tablet doesn't fit into the tablet cover and would have been a little bulkier to carry. It also came with a stylus that has a handle for wrapping around the wrist. I was most pleased to see the power adapter included with the package, as a lot of USB-powered electronics I've purchased lately don't seem to include those anymore. I was very happy with everything that came included.I was pleasantly surprised to be contacted by the company a few days after I received my package. They wanted to let me know about an update that was needed to ward off a potential problem connecting to networks (which I never had) and to remind me to register the product as soon as possible to activate the warranty. Apparently, there is a short time frame to do that to receive the warranty, which I wasn't aware of. I appreciated the proactive communication from the company.Overall, I really like this TOSCiDO 10.3 inch Android Tablet. I'm glad I took the plunge and gave this brand a try. YMMV, but in my opinion, it is a quality product with some good specs for the price point.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking to upgrade from my old Vankyo tablet and came across this item, which had some impressive specs. The most impressive feature is the screen quality. It has nice dark blacks with sharp edges and provides a very enjoyable watching experience. Sound is decent for a tablet - nothing earth-shattering, so I would normally just pair it with a nice Bluetooth speaker. The BT feature worked well and had no issues pairing a mouse, keyboard and headphones.Battery life is pretty good, but could be better. I did have it on about 68-70% brightness, though, so more testing might be needed for a final summation of that feature. The included mouse was a bit more plastic-ky that I would have liked, so I bought a replacment, but the keyboard works great. Overall, I think it was great value for the money and I find myself using it much more than my old tablet because it's much quicker with a much better screen.",
