At this price point you are getting great value and quality entertainment. I bought WITH adds but honestly they're unintrusive. The case that fits this model is very handy also. We use for reading, FF, videos and music mostly. Very pleased and definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "At one time I had like an $800 iPad Pro that I mostly used as a Treadmill screen and it was overkill so I sold it and bought this. For my use case which is mostly watching Youtube or Netflix on a Treadmill it's great. These tablets go on sale a lot so I would caveat that its worth it to me when its on sale (eg ~$100 with no ads). Very lightweight and thin, I was surprised. They probably could have made it feel more premium with an aluminum body but plastic is fine, it still feels solid. Picture quality is very good for the price and it's also a lot snappier than I expected. My kids have older Kindle 8's and they are painfully slow to me so it was a nice surprise. Kindles btw are great for kids especially if you pay for their game/app subscription.The only thing that annoys me about Kindle fires is the app store is pretty worthless. I might side-load the Play store at some point to install the NFL app so I can watch games, otherwise its fine for what I am doing which is watching videos on Netflix, Prime or YouTube.If you need an all purpose tablet that you use in lieu of a computer then something like an iPad Pro is the way to go. If you are literally just using a tablet to watch videos bc you don't want to watch them on a 6 inch phone screen then this is perfect for that.UPDATE:I finally decided to try to install the Play Store, turns out it was not as much of a pain as I thought it would be. Lots of tutorials on the web on how to do it. I had it installed in like 5 minutes and that just unlocked so much more stuff. I could install the real YouTube app plus some other apps I wanted. I even installed Call of Duty mobile which to my surprise actually plays really well. I can't believe I got all this for $100, I imagine in time it will even get cheaper as Amazon tends to run a lot of discounts on their products.",

So we ended up going back with the larger tablet that we had purchased once before, and had no problems with in the past. This is our favorite tablet. Our next plans is to order the upgrade 12.",
