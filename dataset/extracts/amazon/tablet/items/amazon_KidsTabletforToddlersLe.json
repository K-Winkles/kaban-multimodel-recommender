Didn\u2019t stay charged long, had to press on it pretty had to get things to work. I had to reset it a few times before it finally died on us. I figured my toddler broke it because he is pretty rough.Bought another one a couple months ago and thought everything was good until one day it stopped connecting to the internet and soon after my toddler brings his tablet to me with a picture of the android guy laying down and I couldn\u2019t figure how to fix it. I reset it AGAIN and it worked for an hour before the dead android guy was back. I gave up on this thing and will suck it up and spend more money on a better tablet that will last longer than a month.DONT BELIEVE EVERY GOOD REVIEW, I bought this thing twice. It\u2019s trash!!!!!",

About a month in, the handle on the case broke off while she was carrying it. Now it\u2019s July and the tablet is totally broken. I reached out to the seller in June when the screen started becoming unresponsive. It started out freezing and then there would be spots of the screen that wouldn\u2019t respond to touch. We would have to rotate the tablet several times to get it to work. I was asked to upload a video to the seller\u2019s customer service email address. A couple days later, I didn\u2019t get a response so I reached out to the seller, to which, they replied that they had received my video and would reach out to me soon with the best resolution this was on 6/12/22. It is now 7/6/22 and I\u2019ve reached out to them several times with no response.",
