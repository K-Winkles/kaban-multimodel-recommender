                "reviewText": "Screen is relatively poor quality and smudgy. The type of Android leaves somewhat to be desired. But it works. The main issue is that I thin they over-hyped the speed. IT IS NOT A FAST device, either responding to touches, or in general. They make it sound like it has all this memory and processing speed. Well, yeah, nope.With that out of the way, it's ok. The family-style games and restrictions are basic and interesting to the targeted age group. It's weaker than an older kid would likely want.The cover is pretty flimsy and unlikely to stand up to actual abuse. I am saying all this to let you know not to get it for yourself ... nor for a rambunctious kid.Key points: its screen is large and there are 2-player games. Adding your own app is doable, but they make it hard to do.I bought 2 (different color cases) for 2 different aged kids. The younger one broke the charger cord because it is hard to insert. No actual charger came with these.Anyway, I hope you like them. My kids are enjoying them, and the setup only took me a few hours each. You need accounts and all that rigamarole. I wish you could just get something and hand it to them. It may be as close as you'll find for Android tabs.We use the time-based restrictions.",

                "reviewText": "When I first got the tablet, the first week it made a static/popping noise, even when it was not being touched or in use. ( have a video but it wont allow me to attach it here for some reason when I attempted). At first I couldn't tell what the noise was or where it was coming from, but sure enough - it was from this tablet. This happened on multiple occasions. I finally started turning it off after use to avoid even hearing the weird noise. Fast forward, the more I use this tablet, the slower it gets. Mind you, it's never been fast to start with. I have only downloaded two apps, which run so slow I just end up picking my phone up and using the app on there. I normally use this tablet for checking emails and web surfing. I cannot even play a music video on this thing, it is extremely slow. Even loading my emails sometimes takes forever. I tried to remain patient, testing my internet on other devices, getting closer to the router, - you name it - nothing else is the problem except this tablet. I am sad to say it didn't work out as I was looking forward to using it and it seemed like a good deal but it is honestly junk! Unfortunately going to return!",

                "reviewText": "Very easy to set up and use. Battery life seems quite good think about 5 hours. Charges quick. New Android charger.. The sleeve is perfect for my 4 year old, makes it easy to hold, its thin plastic rubber sleeve not foam. Easy to put in and out of backpack, light. Came with screen protector on. No damage at all after 3 months.Works fast enough for my 4 year old. Some apps are a bit slow to load but YouTube works fine. Seems like lots of storage so far. Camera is not great but its fun to play with. Sound is good. Back stand works well.Comes with a few education apps that are ok but you can easily download apps from Google play. Abcmouse is a little slow but works fine.My 4 year loves it. Great tablet for the price",

                "reviewText": "I am using primarily for very light web surfing & a utility to use the tablet for typing on a paired phone. The utility would not run on Fire Tablet even with Play Store side loaded. Larger keyboard allows friend with tremor to use phone more easily. She was having extreme difficulty typing passwords due to phone keyboard keys close together. Have streamed several videos without problems. Low end memory & processor so I don't multitask on it. Takes a long time to start up if completely shut down. I have not timed the battery but gut impression is that it is adequate at best. It runs stock android so most Play Store android apps and utilities work. If that is not important to you, then Amazon Fire Tablets on sale have much better price/perfomance. Fire Tablets use Amazons version of android so a lot of apps won't run on it. Even if one goes to trouble of sideloading Googles Play Store & using APKPure or similar site, a number of apps will not run correctly.",

                "reviewText": "So, I bought this tablet for pretty cheap, it was one of the cheaper ones on amazon that I could find. I'm a single mom with 2 kids on one income so, this was the best I could do at the time. I just wanted something my daughter and I could listen to music and play Roblox on together. We downloaded some games, PBS kids and when we launched Roblox, it was so slow It was inoperable. We deleted some apps that we had wanted, just to see if that would help. It didn't. No matter how much you delete you wont be able to play Roblox. With that being said, if we just watch movies on it, or play other games, its a pretty decent device. the screen size is nice. I was not blown away by any features. The only cool thing is that it was cheap, it has a case for the device, not the screen. As we just realized the screen was cracked and cant be used unless we buy a new screen and replace it. I think I will just end up trading it in for a more expensive tablet that will run Roblox. I'm not saying this is a terrible device but for what I wanted it for, I should have waited until I had enough money to get the better tablet. and screen protector and case. ugh $$$$$",
