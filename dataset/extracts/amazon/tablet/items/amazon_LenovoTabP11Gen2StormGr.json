                "reviewText": "I have the 6 GB version of the P11 Pro (gen 2) and have been using it for many months. I was very excited when I ordered this as it seemed to be one of the best value options available at the time and I hadn't had a modern tablet for years...I won't bury the lead here, there are a couple of significant issues that prevent me from recommending this tablet.1. Lenovo does not provide system updates despite promises. As of this review (8/14/23) we are still on Android 12, despite lenovo originally having listed an update to Android 13 in Q1 2023. They have updated their \"upgrade matrix\" to claim the update will be in Q3 of 2023 so I guess we'll see if they keep their word this time.2. Lenovo doesn't provide security updates. Even more worrying than keeping our OS out of date, they seem to make no effort to ensure it is secure. At this time, the current security version is from March 2023.. even my Older LG phone has a newer security version and is on Android 13.3. There is a good bit of lag that I've encountered with processing actions; most notably when swiping from the edge to go back in a browser often takes a couple of seconds to act, to the point where there have been many times where I'll swipe from the edge and think it didn't catch the gesture so do it again resulting in it processing both backs at the same time and jumping further back than I intend. (of course some of that could be app-related but it seems to be the case for all of the apps I use). This processing lag also seems to occur with the double tap to wake, with there being a very noticeable gap between when I tap and when the screen wakes.4. Charging is often slow. Often when charging it says \"charging slowly.\" Whether I'm using the original charger and cable or the ones I use for my LG phone this seems to be the case. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason, it just seems random... and with the big battery it can take a really long time (I tested again just before this review and when I plugged in with the battery at 80% it showed \"slow charging\" and estimated 4 hours to charge).Given their track record the first 2 issues alone prevent me from recommending this tablet. Perusing some forums show that this is a persistent issue with Lenovo across all of their products and so that pushes me away from recommending Lenovo in general, not just this product.If you've made it this far, I'll now mention the good:1. The screen is pretty nice with good colors.2. The battery life is good. if you're using it for watching youtube or other streaming it seems to last pretty long (at least if you're on 60hz refresh).So there you have it, an ok tablet backed by an organization offering bad and/or non-existent support. Hopefully this is helpful to anyone considering future lenovo purchases.",
