Price - Excellent. I need to see and touch. However, unable to do this, I relied on the reviews from others. I also visited the actual manufacturer's web site. Quality - Excellent. Good weight (lbs). Solid design. Once received, I had all four installed. The ride is a major improvement. Very low noise, smooth handling, even in heavy rain. You will not be disappointed. In my humble experience and opinion. TY",

I recommend the seller they had everything in order from the order to setting up the service with Pep boys. I didn't have to pay nothing more than the installation cost the quoted me. Installation includes balancing and new valve stems, very satisfied with my purchase and will be purchasing again. Thank you very much",
