The Cooper Evolution M/T tire gives you the confidence to power through mud and tackle dirt roads. The Evolution M/T is designed with Earth Diggers that tackle tricky terrain with large tread blocks with alternating mud scoops that forcefully dig into loose dirt, sand or sticky mud. It also comes with Mud Slingers that get extra grip from the deep, wide trenches in the tread that continuously clear thick mud from the tire. The Stone Barriers in the tread boost durability while the ridges are designed to help protect against damage from sharp rocks and expel lodged stones. Finally, the Cooper Evolution M/T comes with Trail Grip Sidewall which will power over trail obstacles with \u2018climbers' that grab onto rocks and sticks, providing strong resistance to rubbing.",

Couldnt be happier as far as the shipping.The Tires: They have a nice aggressive look to them and so far in the rain they seem to perform just fine. No crazy maneuvers but I dont feel unconfident with them. As others have said, despite their aggressive tread, there is not a lot of road noise from them which is surprising. Granted this is on a 99 ZR2 Blazer so your results may vary. Great look on the rig with the white letters out, of course.So far, great road grip. Not expecting much off road use but I feel like they will be capable for what I might put them through. We'll see how long they last but for the price I caught these at for a vehicle that sees less than 10k miles a year. They get a solid 5 out of 5.",

                "reviewText": "Put these on my 2020 Jeep. Original tires were awful for traction, could barely get a stuck truck out of the pasture with them when they were new. These have a good bite, yet don't feel squishy when cornering, and have minimal road noise. Mileage dropped a bit, but that was expected going to a wider and more aggressive tire. They look good as well. Was waiting for some rain to see where the limits are. Finally got some and took it out and pushed- hard. Tires stuck like glue. Had two spots on a road I use that flooded (5-6\")doing 30-35, I hit the first one without slowing, never lost traction. Hit the second one same speed and slammed on the brakes in the middle- No ABS activation, it just stopped. I am quite happy with these",

Like when I just put them on I stuck my head out the window to listen if they made any noise but there\u2019s nothing. These things are amazing in all the elements it\u2019s crazy. Have to say they\u2019re especially good in the sand. Have blown me and every one of my buddies minds in the sand pits. They just eat. They also just look awesome. Like the tread pattern just looks so good and they\u2019re just amazing. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get anything else. Even if I ever go up a size I\u2019m sticking with coopers they\u2019ve won me over. Same size nittos, mickeys, bfs, are like $350 a piece it\u2019s nuts. If you want an amazing set of on and off road tires for dirt cheap please get these. Like full honesty. They\u2019re actually insane.",

Road noise is considerably less than the set of Goodyear Wrangler Duratracs on my Chevy 2500. Ran the Jeep up ton85 MPH, no issues, super quiet. BRING ON WINTER! My only complaint is theyre $70 more per tire because I have 18\" wheels. Otherwise, these MTs are worth every penny.",

The 18 inch rim is a killer though. 20 and 17 inch rim sizes cut the cost on these tires by 70 dollars. Just research it and you'll see. 18 in rims suck!7/10 recommend. Good tires. But hard to balance. You'll have some bounce, but not too bad.",
