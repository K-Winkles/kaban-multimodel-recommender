He said that one of the tires does have a little bit of a flat spot, and that the other tire had a low spot but so far with the tires mounted on they seem to be driving nicely car had a rip bent ram, and I\u2019ve been driving with that room for over a year with tons of vibration in my car, so my review may not be accurate because I\u2019m coming based off my experience with the bedroom but so far my car is much quieter and drives a lot smoother mine you I only bought two pairs of tires and they\u2019re currently on the front of my car I may buy another set next week.
