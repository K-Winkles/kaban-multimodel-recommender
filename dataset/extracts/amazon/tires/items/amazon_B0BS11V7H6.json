The maintained surface contact boosts steering responsiveness and driving stability, while the outer shoulder block pattern improves the cornering ability as well. The siping placement generates friction in order to reduce the braking distance. The Citytraxx H/P improves the high speed durability, as the tire prevents heat build-up during the performance.",
