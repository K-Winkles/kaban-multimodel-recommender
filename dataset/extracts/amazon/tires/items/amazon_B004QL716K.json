        "description": "The PARADA Spec-X is Yokohama Tire's Street/Sport Truck All-Season radial developed for performance pickups and SUVs, as well as modern muscle cars like the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger and Dodge Magnum. The PARADA Spec-X is designed to combine impressive looks and confident handling with year-round traction in North America's wide range of weather conditions, including in light snow. The PARADA Spec-X radial's all-season tread compound is molded into an aggressive directional tread design that features linked shoulder blocks, variably sized intermediate tread blocks and two continuous center ribs to combine acceleration, braking and cornering competence with a comfortable ride. A wide circumferential center groove and sweeping lateral grooves provide water evacuation to resist hydroplaning and increase wet traction. The tire's internal structure includes twin steel belts reinforced by spirally wrapped nylon to provide strength, uniformity and durability on top of a polyester cord body that enhances ride quality.",

                "reviewText": "I'm on my 3rd set of these Yokohama Parada's - I've put about 100,000 miles on this tread, all street, city, highway. Prior to these I had Pirelli Scorpions on my Ford F150 HD edition. Remarkable wet traction improvement over the Scorpions. Dry traction is sport like and sticky - I rarely break traction and doesn't squeal much. I know when I'm getting to the limit - and when I do go past, handling is predictable to recover.Not really an all-season tire, but can handle light snow and slush - just go easy.No squirm or sponginess on turns, maybe a little rough on bumps, but quiet on the highway.",

Summer tires perform very poorly in cold temperatures regardless of snow or rain. These tires do pretty well and are good choice for a high performance, cold tire. I would not run them on a high performance car year round.",

The Yokohamas feel plush, quiet and handle well on dry, wet, and snow. I could not believe how much quieter the new tires are! The are still high performance as the Pirrellis and are 40K miles rated but the ride comfort is OWESOME!!! I already put on them several thousand miles and they still feel as new as far as the ride quality. They were also the cheapest tires I could find my my 20\" rims. Highly recommended!!!",
