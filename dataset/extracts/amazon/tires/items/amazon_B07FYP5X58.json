They were first to market with grooved tire treads in 1904 and modern removable touring tires the following year. Continental purchased General Tire in 1987, gaining a foothold in the American market and setting up headquarters outside of Charlotte, with plants in South Carolina and Mississippi. Today, Continental offers all-season, touring, winter, and ultra-high-performance tires for passenger cars, all-terrain and highway-terrain light truck tires, and commercial truck/bus tires. With their quality, performance, and durability, you know you can\u2019t go wrong with Continental tires.",

                "reviewText": "I replaced the OEM tires that came with my 2019 Toyota Yaris. They were Toyo. Not good. The OEM tires didn't even last to 15,000 miles. Narrow, poor grip. Poor wear. Just sad.These new Continental PureContact LS tires are great! The CR review on them was very positive, so I pulled the trigger. So far, I am glad that I did. The ride is noticeably smoother and they also feel like they corner more confidently. Unfortunately, I didn't think to use the smart phone to measure cornering forces, so I can't give you a definitive numerical G value. But my seat-of-the-pants rating is that the new Continentals are better around corners than the old Toyos.I was able to have them installed at the local Pep Boys, on Richmond Highway, in Alexandria, VA. Very straight forward process. Zero hassle. Great service. I won't lie. I was a little apprehensive buying tires on the web. But between doing research on CR magazine and buying through Amazon, I figured that it should be a lot better than sticking with the Toyos.With everything added together, it was such a good deal. I definitely recommend these Continental Tires, and the use of Amazon's installation service.",
