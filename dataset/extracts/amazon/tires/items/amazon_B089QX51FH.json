Backed by a 65,000 mile limited manufacturer tread life, the Ziex CT60 A/S utilizes a large footprint that promotes consistent traction while also boosting stability and fending off uneven wear. A computer optimized design lowers road noises and vibrations for a quiet, comfortable ride, and the Ziex CT60 A/S also features a low rolling resistance design that increases fuel efficiency so that drivers spend more time on the road and less time and money at the pumps.",

Longer tread life 3D Canyon Sipes within the Ziex CT60 A/S interlock in the shoulder to prevent uneven wear that's common with crossover vehicles due to their higher center of gravity. Increased handling performance The asymmetric tread pattern of the Ziex CT60 A/S features a rigid outer shoulder rib that improves handling and stability performance while polygonal-shaped grooves bite into the road to improve traction on wet and snowy roads. Better wet traction Four wide grooves within the tread of the Ziex CT60 A/S quickly funnel water out of the tread to reduce the risk of hydroplaning for better traction on wet roads.",
