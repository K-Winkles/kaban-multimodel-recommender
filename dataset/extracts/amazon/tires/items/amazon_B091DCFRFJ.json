        "description": "The Cooper Discoverer Rugged Trek All-Season 265/50R20 111T Tire is an all-season pickup truck and SUV tire that looks tough because it is tough. It looks aggressive but it also has nice manners. The Rugged Trek has a unique Rough Terrain pattern, which is trail capable and provides extra grip and confidence when you venture off the highway. It also features Stone Blockades, which are ridges in the tire pattern to help keep pesky stones and rocks out of the tire and on the ground where they belong, helping protect the tire from damage when you\u2019re off the beaten path. Rugged Trek is built to provide enhanced grip on wet roads and features Whisper Grooves Technology that blocks the rush of air through the tire, helping to eliminate noise when on the highway. There are dual sidewall designs so you can pick between the Mountain Pass pattern or Knife-Edge pattern, which gives you double the options for your look. Our aggressive tread blocks are designed for quiet on-road performance and deep treads help grip in sticky mud and sand. While this is a tough-looking tire, it is also engineered for a quiet and comfortable drive.",

                "reviewText": "Amazed that a tire this aggressive improved the ride quality of my KR this much. Didn't realize how crappy the GY Kevlar tires that came on the truck are, until I strapped these bad boys on. Water-bottles used to vibrate in the cup-holders with the slightest of imperfections in the roads. Small expansion joints would nearly jar you. I was so disappointed in the ride quality of my 70,000 dollar luxury f150. I mean, you'd feel everything. Those tires only had 25k on them, but my wife curbed one and ruined the tire, and so I decided to go with something better looking, and more capable in the snow...never giving consideration to an upgrade in ride quality. Had them to the same 38psi as my stock tires, and the first trip up the road from where I had them mounted, what was instantly obvious was I wasn't feeling all of those little road imperfections any longer! All those annoying little rattles in the interior were gone! I was like, WTF?! Instantly I liked my truck again! I'm just blown away by the fact that I went to a more aggressive tire and got a major ride quality upgrade. I can hear them more, but just barely. Mostly at about 55 to 65 MPH, but it's actually an enjoyable light roar...nothing obnoxious like a mud tire. Gonna stick with these for the life of this truck, so if they are still made when needed, I will likely replace them about 4 more times, as I run trucks until they are no more. Can't attest to the mileage, as I've only put about 15,000 on them so far...we travel the country, a bunch, so it won't take long before I can give an idea as to how they wear. So far, they still look new.",
