From their start with carriage and bicycle tires, rubber horseshoe pads, and poker chips, Goodyear has been first-to-market with dozens of product innovations, starting with Henry Ford\u2019s first-ever racing tire in 1901, the first-ever nylon-reinforced tire in the 1940s, the first-ever American-made radial tire in the 1970s, and on and on to the present day. The Goodyear Blimp is a familiar sight for millions of people, an iconic advertising device that also provides great aerial views of football games and events. Whether you\u2019re looking for passenger, light truck, commercial, agricultural, industrial, or racing tires, Goodyear\u2019s reputation for quality and performance makes them the perfect choice.",

They still had tread and I could have run them to 80,000 but I frequently drive at high speeds in crazy DC region traffic in all kinds of weather and I rely on them to keep me off the jersey wall so I don\u2019t wait until they\u2019re out of tread to replace them. Occasionally, when nobody\u2019s looking, roll them north of 100mph and they ride smooth as silk though when they get near the end of their life I usually notice what feels like a failed belt. Also I live in a rural area with super windy hilly roads and not afraid to put the car through its paces but these tires have never lost traction no matter how hard I push.",

                "reviewText": "I took my tire in for a rotation around 9k miles and the shop noticed the sidewall had tore on TWO tires in TWO places each. I had them replaced right away as I told it was not safe to drive on. Afterwards I took the tires to an authorized Goodyear dealer and they said they could give me a discount on another set of tires. I told them I already replaced them and they said they could do nothing. My tires were at 9/32 with zero other wear issues. I am not happy with the customer service from Goodyear, especially for a clear manufacture defect.",
