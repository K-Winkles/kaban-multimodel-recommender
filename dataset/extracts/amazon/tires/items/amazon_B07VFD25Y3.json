        "description": "The Bridgestone Blizzak WS90 tire is engineered for winter driving performance to help keep your vehicle in control through the harshest conditions. This winter tire is designed to provide confident control and secure handling on snow and ice for your car or minivan. The Blizzak WS90 is shown to be a leader in control on ice; and deliver long-lasting performance for an extra winter season*. *Assuming tires are only used in the winter season which is defined as approximately from mid-October to mid-April (6 months for very cold regions) and that an average user would go about 1,200 miles per month, the Bridgestone Blizzak WS90 would last an extra winter season vs. the Bridgestone Blizzak WS80 tire. Based on internal testing on a closed course using a Toyota Camry and the Michelin X-Ice Xi3 tire in size 215/55R17, the Toyo GSi5 tire in size 215/55R17, the Continental WinterContact SI tire in size 215/55R17, Nokian Hakkapeliitta R2 tire in size 215/55/R17, and the Bridgestone Blizzak WS90 tire in size 215/55/R17. Actual results on road may vary.",

Founded by Shojiro Ishibashi, Bridgestone was modeled along the quality-control ideas of American engineer W. Edwards Deming, and was first-to-market in Japan with innovations like the first rayon-cord tire in 1951, early adoption of radial tires, and the first nylon-cord tire in 1959. Bridgestone bought US manufacturer Firestone, vastly expanding their research and development, manufacturing, and distribution network. Today, Bridgestone's product line includes everything from 10-inch go-kart tires to radial tires for earthmovers, standing over 13 feet tall. Bridgestone is also dedicated to sustainability, and several models of low rolling resistance tires that help cut carbon emissions and fuel consumption.",
