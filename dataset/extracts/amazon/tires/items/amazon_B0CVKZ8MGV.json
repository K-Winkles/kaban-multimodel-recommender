All tracking information can be checked on courier's website.Goodride Cross Legend SU320The Goodride Cross Legend SU320 is a touring, all season tire manufactured for passenger vehicles and SUVs. The zigzag siping placement and durable compound increase dry, wet, and winter traction, while the circumferential grooves combat hydroplaning. Consistent road contact helps to improve controllability, which is achieved with the high-stiffness center tread area. The sipe placement generates friction, significantly shortening the braking distance. High driving comfort levels are guaranteed as the footprint absorbs driving shock, lowering the road vibration levels. The Cross Legend SU320 also lowers road noise levels, by preventing sound wave formations. FeaturesComfortable Drive \u2013 The ribbed block placement\u2019s close road contact reduces road vibrations felt in the vehicle\u2019s cabin at all times.Quiet Tire \u2013 The optimal footprint effectively lowers road noise levels, as airwaves are channeled through the footprint during the drive.Fuel Efficiency \u2013 Excellent traction lowers rolling resistance, which minimizes the vehicle\u2019s fuel consumption and CO2 emissions levels.Braking Ability \u2013 The sipe and lateral groove pattern decrease the model\u2019s braking distance by providing additional traction when stopping.All Season Tire \u2013 The all season compound and detailed tread design boost the tire\u2019s superb year-round traction and hydroplaning resistance.Handling \u2013 The high-stiffness center tread ensures the model\u2019s surface contact, greatly improving its steering responsiveness and driving stability.",
