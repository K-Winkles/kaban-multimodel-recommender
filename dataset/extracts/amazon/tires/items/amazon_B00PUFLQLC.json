They were first to market with grooved tire treads in 1904 and modern removable touring tires the following year. Continental purchased General Tire in 1987, gaining a foothold in the American market and setting up headquarters outside of Charlotte, with plants in South Carolina and Mississippi. Today, Continental offers all-season, touring, winter, and ultra-high-performance tires for passenger cars, all-terrain and highway-terrain light truck tires, and commercial truck/bus tires. With their quality, performance, and durability, you know you can\u2019t go wrong with Continental tires.",
