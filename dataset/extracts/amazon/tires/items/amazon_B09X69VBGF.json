After 5 days, I ended up using the Amazon feature to reschedule my appointment and wait for another email. Two more days went by and still no email.My advice: call the local garage and talk to someone. The owner answered and managed to fit me in. I told him about the emails and he said that mis-communication between the two services sometimes miss an email. So CALL and talk to your local garage.Service was excellent and very happy with my purchase.",

You could see the little bits of to much rubber that wasn't trimmed off meaning they were no doubt they were new. The tires went on right and the ride is very smooth. I have put around 500 miles on them and the ride is much smoother than the more expensive set I had before. This set went on a 06 honda element awd best ride I have got out of tires on it. I would recommend 100% for road. I can't speak to off road or snow but I can't see them being bad in snow and that's fine for me. Do keep in mind you will have to pay to get them mounted and balanced which ran me 25 a tire so had to add another 100 bucks for that. Over all great ride look good even gave me a little more mpg nothing life changing but a mile or two more than I was getting will add up.",
