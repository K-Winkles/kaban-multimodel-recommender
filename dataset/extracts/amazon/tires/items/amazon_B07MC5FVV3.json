The tires are really soft and in the past year of owning them she has already had two blowouts on them. I've also had one that got punctured just the other day and I had it plugged, as we aired the tire back up 2 big knots came out on the inside of the tire. We have 5 cars and only drive the Mercedes about 25 miles a week back and forth from her job. We have never had this much trouble out of any of our other vehicles with the tires! I'm going to go to a different brand.",
