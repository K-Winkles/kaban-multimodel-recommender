                "reviewText": "From having the Vercelli Strada II and Achilles ATR Sport 2, this tire from Summit is better than both in many areas. It is more quiet, easier to balance, and cheaper than both of them. As for tread ware they are rated for about the same across all three i've used. If balanced and rotated properly the tire should last well into the 40k miles under realistic conditions. my 02 mustang that i have has awful worn out suspension which causes the tire to ware unevenly, yet this tire hasnt been worn enough to needing to be replaced yet. Bought and had the 2 mounted on the front since the beginning of 2023 and now going into the new year this tire has not worn much even with bad suspension and slightly off alignment. On the road the tire is also quiet at almost all speed. Tire grips very well in dry weather as well and have zero issues with wet weather as i live in the mid-west with all kind of weather patterns. If you need a cheap high performance that can handle 160+ mph and actually hold well in all around weather it does not get better than this. You can get this tire for under $100 vs going to a retail shop and spending upwards to almost $200 per tire to get the same performance and life expectancy, yeah i'd rather not.",

                "reviewText": "I've never heard of the brand Summit, but the reviews were pretty good, only a few bad reviews. I had them installed at a local tire shop. It was a rainy day, the tires had sort of a strange look to the tread pattern, but once I started to drive on them, the differences with the OEM Hankook Kinergy GT H436 was quite evident.These Summit tires were quieter, smoother riding and had more traction in the rain and today it was not raining and the same was true. This is the second day of driving on these new tires and I am quite satisfied with them, great price and good performance overall. As far as mileage, I won't be able to tell for a while. But this appears to be a great tire at a really good price, definitely would recommend.",

My fuel economy dipped from 43.3 MPG to about 42.3 MGP. However, that's due to the extra grip these tires provide. I'm ok w/ that tradeoff. Time will tell how long they\u2019ll last.PRO-TIP: Get an alignment done after you install these tires. Everyone that's complained about severe tire wear are due to alignment issues w/ their vehicle.",

                "reviewText": "I couldn't find a bad review on these. The price is unbeatable. I gotta throw em on my car (ford fusion hybrid) and see how it goes.They arrived naked, but undamaged. The dot was 3223. So they were made around August which is great! They are new enough tires. That was my next biggest concern ordering online was getting old tires. So far so good! I'll update after I put miles on em.*Edit 1* put them on the car at my local Firestone. They feel great. They are quiet enough. I would rate road noise as average. The grip in the rain has been fine. Average again. Not throwing the car into corners(yet) but I drove around town in the rain and never lost grip. Very happy with these tires initially.Edit 2Been driving the heck out of my car with these tires just ONE COMPLAINT. They are quiet. They grip well. They haven't negatively effected my mpg, but it does seem that they're hard for the shop to balance.I had to take em back after initial period bc of a vibration. They didn't get the balance right.Other than that, I'm super duper happy with these damn tires. I usually just buy once cry once ang get michelin bc I trust them, but I have no regrets going with these 2023 Inflation budget specials.*Edit 3*I have put a few thousand of miles on these, I am SHOCKED how good they are. In the american southeast with torrential rain, this cold front, and all general driving these tires have performed as good as any michelin I've paid the big bucks for.I Cannot recommend these tires more!",

                "reviewText": "First time iv ever cheaped out on tires one of the things i normally spend the money on but these tires are fantastic! Bought 4 new for my vw jetta ive put about 4k miles on them and its been about 2 months (i drive alot for work) they ride smooth look good and the tread walls are id call it medium definitely not soft or weak but not as strong as iv seen tires. Overall for the price you can not beat it and will definitely be purchasing more of these in the future 5 stars indeed!!",
