                "reviewText": "So I am a car enthusiast and checked Tire Rack about these tires. They have the best rating out of any tire in its class & size. Tire Racks price was $389 ea. My friend has a repair shop and I usually get my tires from him. He came back at $275 ea.Amazon\u2019s price was $299 ea. My friend couldn\u2019t believe it and he said when he buys tires for his car that\u2019s where he\u2019s going to check first.",

And with delivery to an installer near me, at a great price, a win-win. Thank you Amazon. Oh, and I saved over $500 on 4 tires.",

I know they fit (per manufacturer), but Amazon fit tool said they did not. Strangely these tires kept coming up as an option for my vehicle in the Amazon tool, but then said they did not fit. Weird. Circular process. Long story short, they did fit. Like a glove. Currently on my vehicle. Despite that, overall thrilled with the service. I also qualified for mfg rebate. Yes!",
