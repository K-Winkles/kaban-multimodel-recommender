They were first to market with grooved tire treads in 1904 and modern removable touring tires the following year. Continental purchased General Tire in 1987, gaining a foothold in the American market and setting up headquarters outside of Charlotte, with plants in South Carolina and Mississippi. Today, Continental offers all-season, touring, winter, and ultra-high-performance tires for passenger cars, all-terrain and highway-terrain light truck tires, and commercial truck/bus tires. With their quality, performance, and durability, you know you can\u2019t go wrong with Continental tires.",

I was quite happy that I had them on the car. As I slowly drove up the long, snow covered driveway, they didn't slip. On the windy and hilly roads leading me out of the area, they again did not slip. Once we hit the snow and ice covered highway, I was able to maintain speed without concern. After the first real winter test, I can comfortably give them 5 stars.",
