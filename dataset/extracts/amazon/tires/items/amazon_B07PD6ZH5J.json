                "reviewText": "That WAS my 1999 Mustang that ive daily driven for the past 6 years. Yes, i know the jokes about these cars being \"crowd killers\" etc but this review is about tires. Ever since ive owned that car ive always ran Falkens. They were great on that particular model of car and made it handle amazingly well for a mustang. Never once in 6 years was i ever \"out of control\" on that brand of rubber and i did drive that car hard all the time.It came time for me to get tires again and this time i was a lil short on cash and i needed a less expensive set so i shopped around and in my haste i decided on this set of Lexanis. I may as well have jus glued hockey pucks to my wheels. My car suddenly became not just some safe old beater but now it was EXCITING! Understeer is an understatement. If it was early morning and the roads were damp with dew, ICE RINK! I learned to drive slow. I learned that my car was all of the sudden exactly the joke that i defended. After all 6 years without any accidental collisions. Thru snow, sleet, rain, and sunshine. Never missed a turn. I could go to Mexico at any time. Well these Lexanis, they dont. Period. I was only goin 30 maybe 35 around a not sharp turn just like ive done literally a thousand times in that same vehicle. It was misty outside and the understeer was back again with a vengeance. Slid me right off the road and square into a tree. Do not get these tires!",
