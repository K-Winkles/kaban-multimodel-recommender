        "description": "The Starfire WR All-Season 215/45R18XL 93W Tire is a high performance tire for drivers who want maximum performance for a great value. Built with an asymmetrical tread design, the WR is made to have good grip and a more comfortable and quiet ride. The tire features shoulder blocks that are designed to enhance the braking capacity and steering response to ensure safety. The advanced 5-rib asymmetric tread pattern provides sustained tire performance with even tread wear, less noise and increased overall tread life. The four wide circumferential grooves provide superior hydroplanning resistance. It is also a true all-season high performance tire, so it is acceptable for light snow and winter road conditions. The Starfire WR tire is suitable for passenger vehicles, sedans, and smaller SUVs.",

                "reviewText": "Tires arrived quickly and mounted / balanced with no problems. Seemed to have very good traction on dry and wet surfaces. Too late in the year to test them in the snow. They do have a more aggressive tread pattern and although 95% of the time are quiet, there is a very small amount of rumble when braking to a stop. Otherwise smooth and quiet above 5 mph. Nice blend of comfort and responsiveness.",

Well they have held up summer and winter hours each way and miles on an access road to a gold mine that is full of chip rock, ruts and mud here in Alaska. I Have yet to have a flat. Im impressed! Will buy again even though they figured out how good they are and are charging a little more per tire.",

I did my research and this was the cheapest name brand tire I could find. The tread is deep and they look good on my car. You cannot tell at all that they are a cheap tire, I've had significantly more expensive tires (including michelins) and you cannot tell the difference. I've had no issues in the rain on the highway. At $80 a tire these are a helluva deal.",

                "reviewText": "Great dry and wet traction. No hydroplaning. Quiet, comfortable ride. I have had 3 sets of these tires and each has performed consistently. I have had a set of Michelin Pilot Sport PS2, the benchmark of performance tires, on my car previously and the Starfire WR performs 80% to 90% as well at less than half the price. My only con is that they need to be replaced at about 30,000 miles. However, I drive aggressively and do not rotate my tires as often as you should, so that has to be taken into account. Great tire, great price, best bang for the buck period.",
