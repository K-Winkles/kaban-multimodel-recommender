All tracking information can be checked on courier's website Haida Puma HD818 The Haida Puma HD818 is a mud terrain, all season tire manufactured for light trucks. The tire increases the off-road terrain traction, as the staggered tread blocks and high void ratio upgrade the soft, loose and uneven terrain traction. These tread elements allow the tire to eliminate mud, snow and rocks stuck between the tread elements, while resisting stone retention during the performance. The Puma HD818 increases the controllability as well by ensuring the surface contact throughout the drive, which ensures a better steering responsiveness and driving stability.FeaturesMud Terrain Tire \u2013 The aggressive tread block placement and high void ratio improve the soft, loose and uneven terrain traction.Self-cleaning Tread \u2013 The self-cleaning nature of the footprint boosts the stone retention prevention and keeps the footprint clean.Controllability \u2013 The stabilized footprint\u2019s constant surface contact enhances the steering responsiveness and the driving stability.",
