The Goodyear Blimp is a familiar sight for millions of people, an iconic advertising device that also provides great aerial views of football games and events. Whether you\u2019re looking for passenger, light truck, commercial, agricultural, industrial, or racing tires, Goodyear\u2019s reputation for quality and performance makes them the perfect choice.",

Even with wires sticking out, it survived long enough for me to order new tires and get to the shop to swap them out. I've been very happy with these tires, and (as of when purchased) you can't beat Amazon's price on them.",

                "reviewText": "I have a 14'grand cherokee overland and approximately two weeks ago the time came for me to buy her new shoes. Assuming the standard price for 4 tires, after all, is said and done I assumed to be down $1000 give or take a little. In the. hopes of saving something, I did my homework, stopping at several different tire shops, even calling a few others while en route. Yup....Unfortunately, Iwas about right.As with almost everyone else, I find myself slowly buying more and more from Amazon. To no surprise, (anymore at least) the more I purchase from Amazon, the more satisfied I am with my decision to not move and check out remotely as opposed to doing it...The old fashion way? But some things, no matter what or how impressed I became with Amazon's ability to win me over, I felt were simply not meant to be purchased online. Groceries, electronics...suits......TIRES.....I don't even need to finish the review because I'm sure you already know the outcome! Exactly! So to get you back to what's most likely the main reason you're even reading this....I let my curiosity beat me out and found the exact 4 tires on Amazon. Taking another shot with the installation package, at this point why not right? I completed my first car tire purchase online. Well...After a very pleasant and most of all quick experience at the auto-center, I ultimately was able to save time, hassle, energy and most of all...almost enough to buy an entire second set of tires.. Well done Amazon! You win again!",

Fast shipping and tires are brand new and good looking too. Though my 1st purchased of these tires was a set of two, for the front, and I bought them so expensive $170ish each. And the 2nd set of two for the rear, i bought them for $151 each. And now its $149. Grrrrrr but anyway still im happy with these tires.

The reason I purchased them is they were the exact ones that came with the car when it was new.Overall I am pleased. I live in New England and we have some pretty harsh winters. The tires seem to be lasting fine. No issue with mileage (as long as you rotate them). I do not drive long distances but I need tires that hold traction in the snow. These do the job.They seem to get a little more noisy with age. I can't really find anything wrong with them and I think they are a good value. But, I will probably try something else just to have a comparison for next time.",
