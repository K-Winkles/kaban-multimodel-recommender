                "reviewText": "Bought four tires for my Edge. They are the exact same tires and threads as what was on the vehicle. Smooth and quiet. Also went with the Pep Boys installation service one can purchase at the same time, although I couldn\u2019t get it to work at purchase so I ordered the tires and called my local Pep Boys and scheduled the install. When one is able to purchase it at the time of sale, the tires are supposed to be shipped directly to Pep Boys. Didn\u2019t happen in my case. No big deal. As far as Pep Boys go, they were fantastic. Took the car right in and a couple hours later, I was on my way. The Mrs Honda will need tires in the Fall and as this was so successful, I\u2019ll do it the same way. Prior to this I always bought tire from Town Fair. A very good company to deal with, but this transaction worked out seamlessly. I even saved almost 200 bucks this way.",
