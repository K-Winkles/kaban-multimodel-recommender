There are plenty of other options that are more expensive, but these are best bang for buck. Will they last long? Don\u2019t know yet. But if they last 2 years or more then they where worth every penny; especially for the price and performance. Would buy them again.",

                "reviewText": "I bought 2 of these tires and one of them failed in less than 2 months. I was driving around town and I pulled into a parking lot. As I was pulling into a parking space I got a \"Low tire pressure\" warning light. In my car I can pull up a screen that will show me the tire pressure for all 4 tires. My left rear tire was showing 0 pressure. Which didn't make sense. I was just driving the car and the tires were fine. I thought it was a sensor error. But I got out and looked and the tire was actually flat. It just completely flat instantly. Upon closer inspection I found a slit on the side wall about 1 1/2 inches, like it just burst for no reason. I didn't hit a curb or run over anything. I contacted the seller to let them know what happened, but I got no reply from them. So, I had to replace that tire. I still have one of these tires on my car. I'm hoping the other one won't do the same thing.",
