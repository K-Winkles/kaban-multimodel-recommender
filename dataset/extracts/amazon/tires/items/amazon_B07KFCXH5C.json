I do not have to go away from my work to exercise and it keeps me away from people helping my social distancing. it saved me thousands on buying an indoor bike when I have a great bike that is custom built for me. it is very quiet and I get good workouts out of it. 40 minutes every other day keeps me active and controls weight gain. in the warmer days coming I can easily take it off the trainer and use it as a regular bike. it was a great buy. it is going to become handy in the winter as well when I cannot go out and bike. great buy and super easy to set up. it is basically pre assembled. it folds flat so it fits under the bed out of the way when not in use. the only thing I replaced was the central pin on the back wheel. the rest of the bike required very little assembly with a screwdriver. I set it up in ten minutes. not complicated at all and I am super pleased with the quality.",

                "reviewText": "This is a very sturdy stand for converting your outdoor bike into a stationary bike. It is pretty quiet, but only if you have street tires. I tried it with my mountain bike tires and it was noisy enough to scare my cats. Once I switched the tire to a low tread option, it was quiet enough that I could watch TV at a normal volume and the kitties weren't running away. The problem is, now I have to switch out my tires when I want to ride outside again. The resistance adjuster doesn't change much, but combined with changing bike gears, you can get a solid workout using this. I'd recommend for anyone who is has a street bike, or if you have a mountain bike, be prepared to swap tires often.",

                "reviewText": "I was super excited when I received my bike trainer stand. It took me all of 20 minutes to put it together and was super easy with the instructions. Once I got my specialized mountain bike with 29\" tires on the stand, all worked well until I pedaled. It was SUPER LOUD! After messing with it a few times, I figured that it must be the thick tread and that I would need a flatter tire. In the meantime, the company reached out to me and after explaining my problem, they shipped me a new part at no cost to me to try that out before purchasing a different tire. Long story short, I had to purchase the new street tire and it works! Much quieter! So overall, I love this bike trainer and it serves it's purpose. Customer service and satisfaction has been above and beyond! I would recommend this product, just make sure you know it will be loud with a tire that has a decent amount of tread or that you will have to purchase a new tire.",

                "reviewText": "I did read a number of reviews about bike stands. I choose this one, some were more expensive, as it seemed most reviews said it was quiet. Yes, it is very quit. The only thing I hear is the chain on the gears on my bike. I am using narrow, fairly slick street tires. It is easy to assemble, and easy to set the bike on the stand. I like the two methods of pressure adjustment; one that affixes to handlebars and has a cable to the magnetic flywheel and the other one with the little adjustment directly on the magnetic flywheel. And of course I can further adjust pressure with the bike gears. It's very sturdy when I'm on my bike, I'm 6'1\" about 195lbs.. It folds up and is easily stored. And it's a great color, red. It is well worth the price.",

The second critical factor is getting the rear wheel tensioning screw adjusted to the proper tension\u2026too much and the action is sticky\u2026too little and there\u2019s insufficient drag for good exercise. I wish the engineers had created a tensioning mechanism that could be reset without fiddling.I\u2019m riding a 12-speed trail bike with street tires and using the speeds to provide the appropriate amount of exercise drag.For the price, this device is a GREAT VALUE!!!",

                "reviewText": "There are a number of frustrations with this product that make me wish I'd sprung for a more expensive model (or perhaps just another/cheaper consumer brand.)I bought this for indoor training as I'm currently quarantined with a high-risk health condition and needed some exercise while stuck indoors. The instructions were a bit vague in the first place, and the skewer for the rear wheel didn't entirely fit my bike, so I've had to fit a number of washers between the end-piece that screws on to the skewer. The locking screw on the end of said the skewer also has a texture to it that gets caught in the locking mechanism of the stand, which in turn means that if you make any adjustments by loosening the right side of the stand to re-center the bike, it will loosen the locking bolt without you knowing it, rendering the bike to come unlevel during your ride, or causing your wheel to re-center and rub on the frame. It's a hard battle to figure how to make this not happen. Also, while it's relatively loud in the first place, it at times develops a high-pitch squeal that no amount of adjusting seems to fix, and is just annoying as hell. Are there fixes? Maybe, but there isn't any info in the very vague instructions.In the end, the amount of time that I have spent STRESSING over adjusting, re-adjusting, pulling my hair out, and tripping as I dismount in frustration is astronomically high compared to the amount of time I have actually been able to just peacefully ride. Today, for instance, I have spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out how to make the damn thing happy\u2014and I'm at the point where I'd rather just go read and say the hell with exercise. The stress isn't worth the price tag or the attempt at physical/mental health and I generally feel more mentally worn out for trying.",

Decided this waas the answer, as I can still use my trusty old bike and get the exercise I need. Simple to put together and after replacing the quick releasae skewer from mine to the one provided, my bike was connected in minutes. Adjustable tension, means you can really get a range of workouts for a gentle pedal to very strenuous. If I want my bike to go out on (when the weather improves!), it will simply mean undoing each side by hand and riding off. As the bike does get raised by a few inches, I have to mount it using the pedal, but it is really stable on my garage floor. Comes with a mobile phone holder, which comes in handy as I use this for timing myself and listening to music via bluetooth headphones.",
