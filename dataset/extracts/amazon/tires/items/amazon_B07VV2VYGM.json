I just put them on my front rims today while I got a brake job and my car is super quiet has great traction, is amazingly smooth ride! I can't really talk about where and mileage because I drive 30 to 40,000 mi a year so I burn through tires. which is exactly why I bought these as opposed to replacing the original handcooks. they've got a nice profile they've got a nice tread pattern again they're very quiet but they really grip the road. I was a little nervous because I saw other people write reviews about poor manufacturing when they received these exact tires but, like I said I bought them in the past and had nothing but good things to say about them then and I'm confident that they will treat me well again this time around.",

Very disappointed with the quick wear of these cheap tires. I should have known that they were poor-quality tires at $100 a piece.But how can tires last just 4,000 miles? I am 70 years old and do not drive hard....like burning tires...I will try again to contact the company tomorrow and share the photos",
