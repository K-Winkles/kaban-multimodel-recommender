        "description": "Forceum Octa - The Forceum Octa is a performance and high performance, all season tire manufactured for passenger vehicles and SUVs. The asymmetric tread design ensures an excellent all weather traction, while the circumferential grooves prevent hydroplaning by dispersing water. The three center ribs boost the tire\u2019s controllability, in other words the steering responsiveness and driving stability, and manage to shorten the braking distance greatly. The outer shoulder tread blocks increase the cornering and maneuvering ability and power. The Octa guarantees a quiet drive with the reduced road noise levels. Features - All Season Tire \u2013 The asymmetric tread\u2019s dual zone design boosts the all weather road gripping ability with its excellent road contact. Hydroplaning \u2013 The wet zone features circumferential grooves that prevent hydroplaning by dispersing water from below the footprint. Handling \u2013 The tread\u2019s three center ribs stabilize the tire and enhance the steering responsiveness with the better road contact. Cornering Ability \u2013 The outer tread design\u2019s tread blocks enhance the number of biting edges to boost the cornering ability and power. Braking Ability \u2013 The three center ribs maintain constant road contact and manage to shorten the braking distance significantly. Quiet Tire \u2013 The tread design lowers the road noise heard while the tires are in motion with its variable pitch tread block design.",

The specs on these tires are pretty good. They are also a decent looking tire. Not being made in china is also a plus. I was pleasantly surprised after we had these mounted. They have great tread, ride very nice, and are nice and quiet. Time will tell how they hold up.",
