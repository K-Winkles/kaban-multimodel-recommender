                "reviewText": "Very good tire for the price. I paid $80 for mount and balanced. Tires came via FedEx / UPS relatively quick! Mine came from Texas.If you look up other sizes of Milestar tires, you will see they generally have a 4.5 stars or 5 stars rating. They are a Taiwanese company, which is generally a lot better than Chinese companies (quality control speaking). I got these for my newly acquired 2007 Honda Accord SE V6, exact same size as what Honda recommends. So far so good (only got about 250 miles in a few days). I will definitely update how these hold up. They are good looking tires (my car is dirty, makes it look bad), and very quiet like others have mentioned. I liked them enough that I recommended them to my roommate, who has a 2008 Mazda 3 and my girlfriend who has a 2007 Scion tc. My roommate's got here on Thursday, and they were ordered on Monday night. Very quick delivery. Again, I will update how well they hold up. If the review is still 5 stars, they are still running well!*Update: 11/25/2016Still 5 stars. I have put about 1500 miles on these tires now, and so far so good. I still think they look really nice. My roommate bought his for his Mazda and they are running well also as far as I could tell. I actually recommended my girlfriend to get the same brand for her 2007 Scion TC as well. At about $60 a tire, I am wondering if I should just skip alignment since each alignment would cost more than 1 tire.*Update: 1/4/2017I have had it for about 3500 miles (3 months) now, and I have gone through quite a few nasty snow storms here in Utah. I have taken it up the mountains skiing in a storm (probably unwise because I did not have chains), I have driven through unplowed streets & slushy highways, and I have yet to get stuck. So far these tires have blown my mind how well they handle in snow and wet condition. I absolutely love these tires, for the price, for their looks, and for their winter performance.*Update: 6/29/2018I have put on about 32,000 miles on these bad boys now. They are still running well. I do my own rotation without alignment (because it doesn't make sense to pay $70 to align when that costs more than one new tire). So they have worn a little unevenly on the outside, but no problems so far. The longest trip I have taken these was a 1550 mile round trip to California. The tread have definitely worn down quiet a bit (I live in Utah, mostly dry condition). They will probably last me the whole 45,000 miles as their warranty covers. But I don't think I will get more out of them. I drive about 20,000 miles a year, so just barely over 2 years. For the price I paid (240 tires + 80 mounting), I think it is pretty dang good. I will update again when it hits 40k or 45k or when I have to swap them. Still highly recommended.*Update: 9/6/2018These tires just went over 40k miles on my 2007 Accord. I have put 20k+ miles per year on them and I have had no problems so far. Tread is down to 3/32 (outside edge) to 6/32 (center). I did not get any alignment done except when I installed the tires. I rotated them about 6-8k miles (not frequent enough but I only do it when I change my own synthetic oil). They will probably make it to 45k if I had taken better care of them, but I will probably swap them out before the snow season begins anyway. I might try out the Nankang SP-9 Cross-Sport next time, just because it is $7 more per tire but rated at 50k miles. Or I might stick with these ones again, I will update again.Nov 5, 2018*I ended up buying another set of Milestar. The old ones I took off I would be comfortable to drive them for another 2000 miles",

But I ordered them anyway. They are the same as the Yokohama and do a great job. They are a little louder but I do not mind that at all. They have great traction, they look great, they are nice tires. I have been using them for about a week and it feels like my car drives so much better.",

                "reviewText": "I have a 2009 Toyota Matrix with 215/45R17 tire. It's kind of an oddball tire and only slightly larger than compact sporty Japanese cars seem to come with this size. They are pretty low profile which usually means an expensive tire. I was broke and just needed something for winter. I ordered 2 of these tires and installed them on my car. I'm an auto mechanic so I did it myself. My first impression of these tires was that they were excellent. Good grip, quiet, good in the rain and when new good in the snow. I installed these in late September 2019 and by late March 2020 I'm just about ready for another set. To be honest I'm not sure how many miles I put on them. I never rotated them so it kind of burned up the inside a bit. They have ok tread in the middle. We had an early spring snow storm and when just an inch of snow was on the ground it was Hell trying to get anywhere. Not these tires fault though, obviously worn tires aren't good in snow. If you rotate them and buy a set of 4 to start with you may get longer life. I suspect you get what you pay for and a $100 set of tires isn't going to last as long as the big money brands. But if you are on a budget like I am these are good tires and I will be buying another set of 4 hopefully very soon.",

                "reviewText": "I bought a set of 4 of these tires back in Dec 2016 for my 2011 Ford Fusion SEL and got a local mom and pop shop to install them. They rode smooth and quiet for 34,500mi and 4 years I got out of them before I had to replace them (rotated them a few times but was sticking to a mileage rotation schedule). When it was time to get new tires, I decided to get these same set of tires because I really liked how they felt on the car and their price point fits my budget. These were mounted on a South Florida car so I did not experience snow or any extreme cold weather surfaces with these tires, but I did experience driving in really hot temperatures, local street flooding and torrential downpours during highway driving and the car handled well. I saw some reviews that mentioned having tires that have broken belts and other issues after a few hundred miles, but I was lucky with my first set of tires so I rolled the dice and got them again. When you buy stuff like this online you are taking a chance that things work out because if it doesn\u2019t then you have an uphill battle trying to prove a defective product to someone who is not around for you to physically show them what is wrong with the product, and then you have a third party doing the install and that complicates things even more. Hope this helps. Keep the shiny side up!! ;-)",
