First at the grocery store, then at the off road swap meet, where I saw people paying redicules prices on wore out second hand tires, while I just smiled know what I had just purchased brand new at less then these used ones were going for.

And they look awesome! In fact two different people have described them as 'sexy'! I saw where someone had mentioned the air pressure and side to side sway if the pressure is low. A lot of people set it lower for a softer ride. Don't do it with these tires, air them up to 80psi. Esoecially if you pull a trailer or carry heavy loads. But they work great on my 98 Chevy Z71.",
