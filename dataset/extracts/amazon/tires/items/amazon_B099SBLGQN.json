                "reviewText": "I wanted a rugged looking aggressive all-terrain tire on my 2023 RAM 2500. I did look at all brands, and am excited about the Thunderer Rangers. I installed 35x12.5x20's and couldn't be more satisfied. They seem to have less road noise than other brands that I have run. They balanced really nicely with very little added weights. Not enough run time yet for mileage review, but all together a good choice so far",
