                "reviewText": "These tires looked great I had them professionally put on and drove them and they was ok on the street but when I drove them on the highway they was shaking violently and I immediately took them back to the tire shop by then they got rid of my old tires a day later. They told me that my tires was out of round by testing them on the machine. I went through the warranty and every time I give them what they asked for they always told me they need more proof to send them. I was back and forth with this company warranty over 6 times giving them proof that I purchased from them n still got no refund so I was stuck with these tires. I had the tire shop put 7oz weights on each tire to balance them out so they stop shaking while driving on the highway. I'm totally pissed at how they put the buyer through so much to replace the new pair of front tires. I didn't want my money back I wanted a replacement to have a smooth ride. If u buy these tires make sure u speak with the seller b4 buying them so u get a perfectly round tire cause the warranty is a hassle trying to get a replacement or a refund they put u through alot to get compensated. I took a loss from this sale. Very dissatisfied. I won't buy from this company again. Bad business",
