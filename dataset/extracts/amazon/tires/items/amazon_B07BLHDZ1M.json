The tread is thick. The tires are brand new, there were no issues with our mechanic putting them on. And they fit the new rims we had to buy well. They arrived in one day and the price was sooo good compared to the price Toyota charges us for 1 run flat tire. Definitely recommend these all season tires.",

I didn't want to spend a lot of money on tires for a 2011, but wanted something safe and reliable. 4k miles in, these seem to be the ticket. The ride is smooth, and there is no noticeable slipping in wet conditions. Stopping is more than adequate, and I have not noticed any uneven wear patterns. The best thing, however, is that I have experienced a gain of about 5 miles per gallon in gas mileage over the old set. Some of this may be a function of the extreme wear that was on the old tires, but I will be watching closely to see if the mileage goes down as this set wears. At this point, I would definitely recommend these tires and will buy another set when these wear out.",

                "reviewText": "Glad to see Amazon upset the tire market with these tires. These are the 2nd set purchased, one for a 2007 G35x and now a 2012 Camry SE 4-cyl (17\" wheels).I'm in my 60s, worked as a tire mechanic as a young adult, and have purchased many sets of tires in my lifetime. This Hankook tire is as good as any of them, including any Michelin version out there. The tires wear and balance well. Amazon did its homework carrying this brand. For now, this is the best tire deal out there for most who just want solid OEM replacement tires.Tire Rotation Tip: 1. rotate your tires every 6,000 mi (except for the first time, do it at 3,000 mi*). Tip 2. criss-cross the tires at each rotation* (the Owners Manual tells you otherwise and my experience says otherwise).* The following assumes your vehicle's wheel alignment is within spec. If you criss-cross your tire rotation at each interval (Tip #2), each tire spins in the opposite after rotating. If this makes sense, consider brand new tires to have a ZERO directional mile count. The goal is to not allow your tires to spin more than 3,000 mi in either direction. So, that's why rotate at 3,000 mi on the first rotation interval. During the 2nd interval, after 3,000 mi of tire spinning, you're back to a ZERO directional mile count. You might as well just leave the tires alone and allow them to spin another 3,000 mi so now you have spun 3,000 mi off of the ZERO direction mile count. Hence, why you wait to rotate at 6,000mi on the 2nd thru nth intervals. Truck tires GREATLY benefit from this scheme because of the size of the rubber chunks that make up the tire. Tire \"singing\" is caused by the heel-toe wear on those rubber chunks and using this rotation scheme keeps the heel-toe wear equalized over time. This condition is especially prone to all-terrain tires. Use this rotation scheme and your tires will lose their voice over the wear life of your tires. For passenger vehicles with normal to smaller sized tires, you can likely get away with a 4,000mi/8,000mi scheme and not worry about tire singing. One caveat: if your vehicle's alignment is not right, forget the above. Avoid curbs and major potholes and you should be good. Tire singing is big profit for tire shops and the answer is always: \"you need an alignment\". That may be true. You also just may need to rotate your tires as mentioned above. Also, don't over-torque your lugs (see mfg specs and if you can't find it, use 80 ft lbs to be safe). Many tire shops will torque them to 150 lbs or more causing rotor warping. If you can learn to safely rotate tires yourself (see YouTube for tips), you can save time and money while doing it right. Last tip, inflate your tires to 35psi regardless of what your car says. It's a safe pressure that will roll with little resistance and provide even tread across the width of the tire. Plenty will argue my tire science, but, I get 90,000 mi out of my 2005 Toyota Tacoma tires and the roll as smooth and quietly at 90k as they did at ZERO mi.\ud83d\ude42",

I have only driven about 50 miles so far but I am very pleased with the tires. I have only driven in dry conditions so I will add information once I get some wet weather driving in. They mounted up with no problems, although they did take a little more weight to balance 2 of them than I expected. I like that they make a variety of sizes to accommodate older cars and trucks and offer an alternative to BFG Radial TAs, which I have never been very impressed with. I replaced a set of Firestone Indy 500 tires that I really liked but they no longer make. I will update my review as I get more seat time.",
