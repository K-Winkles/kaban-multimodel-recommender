                "reviewText": "I bought these tires in May of 2022 . I put them on a 2008 nissan maxima I bought for my son when he starts driving. I lowered this car around 2 1/4 inchs all around with coil overs and I had a set of wheels off a 2008 Lexus Is250 I had the center bore turned to fit the maxima and I noticed that the wheels were different sizes 8.5 rear 8 inch in front. So that means I can't rotate them. Well with that I just would check the balance every few months. These tires wear very well and even and I drive the F out of it . The only thing that wore out was the letters on the center tires but they are not that deep. So all in all they are great I will buy them again when they need replacing. I put around 12000 miles and they are not half worn for a soft rubber and they handle good in the rain. So I would say pull the trigger I did the research and driving so feel comfortable buying them.Update 4:25 Friday January 26th.......So Louisiana roads are \ud83d\udca9 with a capital S.. So hitting a minor Crack hole whatever it busted this tire but in the tires defense it was probably under inflated due to the weather and that I put a plug from a welding rod .... so I drove it about 3 miles before I knew something was wrong and eroded the sidewall but whatever I hit nicked the wheel and punched a hole in sidewall. These tires are amazing all the problems with them is driver error and \ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9 Louisiana roadways. I am ordering 2 more because they are good cost and they are soft easily handled at high speed. With around 18000 miles they still have half the thread from new and wear flat and I did a home alignment myself im impressed with the tires. So don't worry about bad reviews they are great tires for the price.",
