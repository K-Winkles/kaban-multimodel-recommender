                "reviewText": "If you are searching for BF Goodrich tires like so many others, you\u2019ll probably notice these as well. It may make you a bit nervous since they aren\u2019t as well-known, but they perform and look just as good as the competition.These tires are very good for a variety of reasons. One is because of their appearance. These tires look phenomenal on classic cars. The 235/60's are wider than average, which gives the car a nice stance. They also feature raised white lettering, which is a fairly sought-after quality on older cars and trucks. Overall, no complaints what-so-ever appearance wise.Overall, they outperform other tires of similar price. The improvement in ride quality was huge. They claim to have a design that makes the ride quiet, and there is a big difference. They also provide a smooth ride, which is one of the most crucial benefits of a tire. They are a bit wider but they also have very good tread. So far, they wear well too. Even after 12,000 miles they still look and perform like new. The only thing you should watch out for is clearance. If you have a sports coupe, you will want to make sure they don\u2019t rub in the wheel wells.One other valuable area with tires is the safety in different weather conditions such as rain. They perform well in wet conditions and are overall very solid. Also keep the speed rating and load index number in mind when purchasing. The 235/60/15\u2019s have a load index number of 98 and have a speed rating of T. This allows safe operation up to 118 mph until the tire wears out. This makes them acceptable for many cars. All in all, no complaints as far as handling or safety.These Cobras are right there with BF Goodrich tires which is a huge plus for many people seeking tires for restoration and classic vehicles. These tires should give you several thousand miles of safe and comfortable travel.",
