Pirelli engineered the Cinturato WeatherActive with an innovative rubber compound plus a new polymer and resin that allows the tire to stay flexible year-round. This compound is vital for high-end performance in wet and snowy conditions without sacrificing mileage. A balanced footprint puts more of the Cinturato WeatherActive on the road, which allows the tire to provide outstanding performance in dry, wet, and winter weather. Additionally, this balanced footprint fends off irregular wear to promote a longer tread life. The Cinturato WeatherActive's trumpet shaped lateral grooves force water out of the tread, which improves wet traction and reduces the risk of hydroplaning.",
