This has been a pretty good tire though and I do not notice any issues in the rain as someone else said but I am only using one at the moment. It is on the front and wet launches have been as good as I could expect. So far I can't complain and if these are still the best \"value\" when I am ready for more then I would buy again. I do prefer Sumitomo because I think they look a little better but after using these I wouldn't pay more for them.",
