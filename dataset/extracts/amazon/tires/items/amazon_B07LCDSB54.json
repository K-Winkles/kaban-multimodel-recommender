                "reviewText": "The Starfire Solarus AS tire is high quality and an excellent value. Starfire is one of several brands designed and manufactured by Cooper Tire. The Solarus AS is a USA-made tire with all of the quality you'd expect from a top tier tire manufacturer. I replaced the aging Goodyear Integrity tires on my 02 Acura MDX with the Solarus AS and am extremely pleased with the handling and quietness of these tires. While I didn't buy them through Amazon (I couldn't pass up a remarkably low price for the 235/65R17 size from W*lm*rt at $65 each plus free shipping to my installer.) I couldn't be happier with this purchase and expect good, long life from the Starfire brand. They are good looking on the rims, as well.",
