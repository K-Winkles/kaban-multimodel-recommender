Founded by Shojiro Ishibashi, Bridgestone was modeled along the quality-control ideas of American engineer W. Edwards Deming, and was first-to-market in Japan with innovations like the first rayon-cord tire in 1951, early adoption of radial tires, and the first nylon-cord tire in 1959. Bridgestone bought US manufacturer Firestone, vastly expanding their research and development, manufacturing, and distribution network. Today, Bridgestone's product line includes everything from 10-inch go-kart tires to radial tires for earthmovers, standing over 13 feet tall. Bridgestone is also dedicated to sustainability, and several models of low rolling resistance tires that help cut carbon emissions and fuel consumption.",
