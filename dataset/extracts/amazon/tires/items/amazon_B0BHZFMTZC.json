All tracking information can be checked on courier's website Haida HD667 The Haida HD667 is a touring, all season tire manufactured for passenger vehicles. The tread design increases the cornering and maneuvering ability with the shoulder block placement. The better road contact improves the overall controllability. The all season compound and symmetric tread design boost the year round traction. The three circumferential grooves prevent hydroplaning. The close road contact minimizes the road vibrations felt by the passengers, as it allows the tire to absorb the shock of driving. The closed shoulder detail of the HD667 lowers the road noise levels by preventing soundwave formations during the performance. Features Cornering Ability \u2013 The shoulder block pattern enhances the cornering and maneuvering ability with the use of extra biting edges.All Season Tire \u2013 The all season compound and the ideal tread elements enhance the dry, wet and winter weather driving experience.Hydroplaning \u2013 The three wide circumferential grooves boost the hydroplaning resistance by dispersing water and slush from the footprint.Handling \u2013 The center tread pattern increases the steering responsiveness and the driving stability by optimizing the tire\u2019s surface contact.Comfortable Drive \u2013 The close road contact allows the tire to absorb the driving shock, lowering the road vibrations felt by the passengers.Quiet Tire \u2013 The tread design\u2019s closed shoulder pattern improves the comfort levels by lowering the road noise heard during the performance.",
