                "reviewText": "I was VERY skeptical of these tires, even after reading the GREAT reviews. I have sipped the kool-aid and it is fantastic - I am ALL in on these tires. Before giving a review, I wanted to wait to see if I had any complaints or issues, but 5k miles into my journey, all is good. The ride is great. The noise level is good (definitely not loud), and my wife is happy (happy wife, happy life)! I have purchased many tires from many different tire companies and these are as good as any high-end tires at a fraction of the price. I will DEFINITELY buy again. I will check back in to give an update at the end of this year to give any updates.",

(Front passenger) so I replaced both front tires with these and so far so good. It\u2019s not a race car by any means but these are quiet and provide more than acceptable traction in wet and dry conditions. Haven\u2019t had an icy day yet but will update if there\u2019s an issue. Great tires for the money",
