All tracking information can be checked on courier's website Forceum Hexa-RThe Forceum Hexa-R is a high performance all season tire manufactured for passenger vehicles. The tire has superb summer weather traction, and it grips the road well in wet, dry and winter conditions. However, it isn\u2019t suited for winter driving. The wet traction and hydroplaning resistance are increased with its water dispersing ability. The V-shaped grooves stabilize the tire at high speeds, while the shoulder tread blocks increase the cornering stability, power and ability. The steering responsiveness and accuracy are also improved with the tread pattern and the maintained road contact. The Hexa-R offers a longer lasting tread life. FeaturesAll Season Tire \u2013 The tread compound and design provide great all weather traction, and ensure excellent road gripping ability all year round.Hydroplaning Resistance \u2013 The V-shaped tread blocks and the unique wide grooves increase the hydroplaning resistance by dispersing water.Stability \u2013 The V-shaped tread blocks increase the tire\u2019s high speed driving stability, and enable high speed performance.Cornering Ability \u2013 The tread design\u2019s tough shoulder blocks improve the cornering ability and power by providing additional biting edges.Steering Responsiveness \u2013 The shoulder tread block pattern also increases the steering responsiveness and accuracy, making the tire easy to control.Longer Tread Life \u2013 The driving pressure is equally distributed along the tread area, preventing uneven wear and extending the tread life.",

                "reviewText": "Forceum Hexa-R 245/40/18It was time to replace tires. I never wait until tires bald or start showing threads. I normally replace when the tire\u2019s built-in indicators are near to leveling. In my experience I would still have around 5k miles left until balding at that point.I\u2019ve been running Nanking NS-20 all around for approx a decade. I had many good experiences with Nankang. I discovered Nanking by price. However, I was extremely surprised and I started using them as my \u201cgo-to\u201d brand. Commute, necessary drift, cornering never had an issue. So income the need to replace rear shoes. After review lurking I decided to take the same chance with these Forceum Hexa-R as I did w Nankang. The Nans were 500AA and Would get around 20-30k on those Rear shoes, for a RWD pusher. That is for all around driving conditions. The wheels are a staggered setup, the rears are cambered to avoid rubbing during aggressive cornering.Upon arrival I noticed that these Forcerum runners are softer. I then realized they are 400AA. For some reason I thought they were 460AA. So I expect them to give less life than the 500AA Nans. What I did notice that post-mounting these Forceum sidewalls seem to work better for my rear setup. Not much rubbing. But this could be attributed to the mounting lube. Time will tell.The treads are a V which seem to control noise but are more prone to pickup small stones more than my NS20\u2019s, which I dislike. But not a big issue. These Forceum seem to do well in aqua dispersion. It\u2019s hurricane season in FL. First ride after mounting involved coming face to dads with heavy storm rain. Handled perfectly.All in all, I took a chance with these due to small price difference and The COVID money-sucking economy. I\u2019m hopeful that combined with my rear setup that these will be competitive with the NS20 500AA. I\u2019m watching and feeling. Front shoes still have plenty of tread. Normally have to replace front shoes every other rear shoe replacement. So by the time these rear Forcerum shoes wear down the fronts will need it. We\u2019ll see how these go.From the start they get 4 stars. I will update with any issues pos or neg.If all goes well I\u2019ll definitely jump to this brand. If the rear\u2019s do well that\u2019s a given front\u2019s will do just as well being the car is pusher and not puller.Update: 9/4/21It's been a year. Has to go from FL to NY several times. Bad snow storms & these held up. I mean RWD in snow? Crazy.I don't know i put on about 12k mi. on a d still appear to be arpind half life give or take. Not a bad tire at all. I like other threads but these do grip nice on those 90s.I say buy w confidence.",

The deep tread traction not only gives them a stylish look but also ensures they performvarious weather conditions, from summer heat to winter cold ( exceptionally well in New Hampshire winters. )These tires strike a perfect balance between all-season convenience and winter capability. Highly recommended for their reliability and performance!",
