                "reviewText": "2017 Kia Soul! 1.6TThis is only an initial impression, as the tires were just installed today, after a two week fiasco in which I've decided to make an effort to never use FedEx again. Such an incompetent company.Anyway, to the tires. My initial impression, at speeds up to about 50 mph, is that they are smoother, quieter, and considerably grippier than the mediocre OEM Nexen CP671 tires they replaced. They have very good response and bite at initial turn-in and very linear grip and response throughout the turn. They have a very nicely refined feel and ride.I can not speak to wet traction or how they ride on the highway yet, or longevity, but I will update this review after I put some miles on them and experience a wider range of driving conditions. But for the price of these tires and the apparent quality that my initial impression suggests, you can't go wrong with them and I definitely recommend them as a great budget alternative to the overpriced big-name brands.*Update*- I have now had several opportunities to drive in the rain, including one torrential downpour. These tires have far better wet traction than the OEM tires that I replaced, in fact they don't seem to lose any significant amount of grip compared to dry pavement. And no hint of hydroplaning up to about 50 mph in rain so hard you can barely see to drive. I'm liking these tires more and more.*2cnd edit* At my first the rotation at 5000 miles, the tires have lost 2/32 on the fronts and 1/32 on the rears. At this wear rate I should get 20k miles or a little more before they need replacing. I consider this to be very adequate for UHP tires.Also, having now taken several long highway trips, a pleasant surprise was that my fuel mileage actually increased by about 2 miles per gallon. Again, I don't think you'll be disappointed with these tires.",

                "reviewText": "Had these tires installed on a AWD 2017 Infiniti QX50. These were road forced balanced I am almost 5000 miles and will have them rebalanced when they are rotated. But so far they perform well at all speeds and they have been up to 135mph and handled very well. Driven in some very heavy rain and no issues with hydroplaning. Road noise is not bad. And at 5000 miles on them they still look new. Cornering is very good and handling is very good as well. But as far as quality I like em. Don\u2019t be afraid to put these on your vehicle. Good price and exceptional value for the money. Edit 2/04/24 Have around 10,000 miles on em and they are wearing very well. Still look new. I have driven in heavy rain and some snow with absolutely no issues. I have had these tires up to 140mph and they handle great.",

My old service Director mentioned he bought these exact same tires for his BMW X6 and that the reviews were good and accurate. Didn\u2019t feel a difference in drivetrain tires look great love the deep treads. Looking forward to buying more at such a great price. I got these four tires for 100 of dollars less than what two would\u2019ve cost me.",

I like the style, wanted something directional and cheap.I also wanted them to perform poorly, allowing me to do fun car things more easily. Cheap Amazon tires? Probably low quality.Unfortunately, these tires are actually considerably grippy in dry and wet conditions. I even took them up to a considerable speed through a dip on a highway where around 1-2 inches of water had collected, knowing they would hydroplane, and just wanting to screw around a bit...HOWEVER... either they cut deep enough into the water to provide enough lateral force in the water (like a rudder) to give me sufficient control of the vehicle, or they just cut through the water entirely and didn't hydroplane at all.I wanted to slide around more easily, and instead, now I'm super glued to the road unless I'm at WOT or steering lock. Absolutely the best quality street tires for the price.",
