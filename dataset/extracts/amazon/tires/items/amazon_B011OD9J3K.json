        "description": "The Mastercraft SRT Touring tire is an all-season tire with long-mileage and a quiet and comfortable ride on sedans, compact cars and minivans. This tire has a 5-rib tread pattern with extra lateral grooves for better all-season grip on wet and even snow and ice covered road. In order to make the tire as quiet as possible, the Mastercraft SRT Touring tire has a newly developed pitch sequence for the tread block arrangement that reduces the amount of tread noise generated by the tire at all speeds. For long tead-life, the Mastercraft SRT Toruing tire has an advanced tread compound that is very hard a durable. The tread blocks have SCS Technology (Stability Control Siping) built for the best possile performance and handling in wet and dry driving conditions.",
