Followed the advice of the MR2 Toyota forum to switch to this tire, all four the same as the rear size. Worked great!Good tracking, low road noise, excellent tires!",

My car rides smoothly anywhere. Also, I paid to change the brake pads for the two front wheels and I feel safer driving. I got the offer of a 12-month payment of Amazon. It is better to buy a high-quality tire like Hankook than a cheaper tire with an unknown brand.",
