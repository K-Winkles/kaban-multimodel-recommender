                "reviewText": "Tire tread is nice. No issues with traction.One tire leaked down because the \"whiskers\" on the edge of the tire were folded down under the rim edge and causing the beed to leak (per the tire installer).When it's cool/cold outside, the tire will ride rough until they warm up. I blame this on the tires taking on a flat spot while sitting overnight. Once warmed up, they run smooth.Overall, I'd buy these again since they are considerably cheaper than the box tire stores.",
