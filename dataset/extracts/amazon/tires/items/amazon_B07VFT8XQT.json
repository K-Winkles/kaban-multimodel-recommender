                "reviewText": "Just got em installed on the front of my 330ci E46. Does need an alignment as toe out is setup harshly for street driving. More for dry tracking. But so far in heavy rain, big difference. No more all over the place, or going straight when turning. Yes old tire were past due. Will update as I do all reviews overtime. Several times if they last. Time will tell, and I drive hard ish, as well as put 50kmiles or so in a year on my car so.Update, over 2000 miles now, tires are great. Would suggest these to toyo touring lovers. Drove from toledo ohio to Ashland ky and no signs of wear. Even still with the toe out issue bc nowhere will align a bmw since \"it takes special tools\" not really, just weights but I'll get it done when it's warm. However the tires again I recommend. No louder than normal tires, handle well in tight cornering, no funky crap in the rain. Get yours before they vanish or up the price.",
