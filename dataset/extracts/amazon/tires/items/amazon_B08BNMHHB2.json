                "reviewText": "I ordered 4 tires of the same size. Received three the correct size, one was wrong.The return process is a multitude of hoops to jump through including submitting pictures of the shipping labels and the tires. They them sent a return label for me to send back the incorrect tire and told me to follow the tracking number and to contact them when I see that it had been delivered to their warehouse. I had to order another tire through amazon to replace the incorrect tire. Now the fun really begins. The first three tires that were correct mounted and balanced without issue.The replacement tire was so out of round that it couldn\u2019t be balaced. It had about an inch of runout. Now the jumping through hoop begins again. I have to submit picture of the DOT codes, the serial number inside of the tire, a statement from my installer regarding the problem with the tire and a picture of the defect. The defect can only be seen while the tire is spinning on the balancer. They are claiming that this is a warranty issue even though the tire has never been mounted on a car or been driven on the road. It shouldn\u2019t have to be this difficult.1) Wrong tire shipped2) Replacement tire defective3) Multiple hoops and processes to try to get the problems solvedI would not recomend Priority Tire to anyone.In addition:The hoops have been moved. Now they want me to take the tire to another shop tohave it mounted and balanced.Now they want a picture of the road force balancer display that shows the defectIt\u2019s just a $50 tire and they want me to spend more money to submit a claim to the manufacture.They don\u2019t warranty a tire that has been mounted.Common sense tells you that mounting and balancing is the only way to find a defectBasically Priority Tire sells a product that they don\u2019t stand behind.Now I have a new unusable tire that I have to pay someone locally to dispose ofTook ordering six tires to get four usable tire of the correct size.",
