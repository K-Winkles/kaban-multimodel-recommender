        "description": "The Firestone All-Season tire is a long-lasting and economical tire for most entry level coupes, sedans and sub-compact economy cars. This tire has a hard a durable tread rubber that is molded into a tread pattern that proves lots of grip on icy and snow covered roads, as well as traction on wet roads. The wet road traction is thanks to circumferential grooves and cuts in the tread blocks that allow water to evacuate quickly from underneath the tire even at high speeds on the highway. For comfort, the tire has an extra layer of rubber under the tread that absorbs irregularities in the road surface for a smoother ride. The Firestone All-Season is a no frills tire that will give you everything you expect from a well-known brand like Firestone: mileage, safety and comfort are yours at a great price.",
