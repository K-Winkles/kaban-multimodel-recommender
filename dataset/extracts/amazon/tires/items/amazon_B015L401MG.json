Seem like similar quality to my old Hankooks these replace. Manufacture dates are a year old by the time it shipped to the US and stored waiting to be bought. See pics for date codes.",

                "reviewText": "Was hesitant to purchase as the price point was so low. But the tires seem fine. Only a few hundred miles on them so far so this is subject to change naturally. Road noise is minimal, and traction appears fine. They were easy to balance, and tech reported no issues. They come from a smaller Asian country, so the difference is truly having no marketing fund burden, and the exchange rate is obviously favorable. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase.",
