The Goodyear Blimp is a familiar sight for millions of people, an iconic advertising device that also provides great aerial views of football games and events. Whether you\u2019re looking for passenger, light truck, commercial, agricultural, industrial, or racing tires, Goodyear\u2019s reputation for quality and performance makes them the perfect choice.",

We don't get a ton of snow in Kansas City but what little we did, the tires did great. I feel confident driving in the rain as well. They aren't super quiet, but also aren't really noisy. For the $85/each we paid, I am very happy. I would buy again.Edit: 10/3/18-The tires now have just over 49k miles on them. Fronts are at 4.5/32 and rears at 4/32. We've been very happy with these tires. If the price hadn't increased so much since we last bought them (about $40 each!), I would consider them again. One thing I really liked about these tires is the rim protector.",

I liked the way they performed and noticed they are very reasonably priced so I decided to buy two this past February to replace my front tires. Now my rear tires are in dire need of replacement as well (They are smooth from wear), however for some reason now Amazon is unable to ship two more to my address when previously this wasn't a problem. My review score doesn't reflect my dissatisfaction with being unable to order two more again for this shipping issue, though I thought I'd bring it to the sellers attention in the event they actually review this review.
