                "reviewText": "Purchased the tire a little over a month ago. Within 2-3 weeks it bubbled atfirst i thought is was my wheel or something being that it was a new tire but whem i checked it out the outside was bubbled as well as inside. The bubbling lead to a blow out and they dont cover road hazard even tho its a defect that caused it. Waste of money on the tire the installation and every minute i spent n more money wasted to replace my tire to get off the aide of the street. Worst company hands down. I will NEVER BUY AGAIN.",
