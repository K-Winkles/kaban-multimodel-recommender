                "reviewText": "Let's start with the tire review first. The tires are decent for the price. Hard to beat. If your in a tight budget for tires then I do recommend them. As for the mileage I will keep tabs and updating them as I go along. They have very flexible sidewalls for a V rated tire. Easy to mount. I do notice since that have a soft sidewall they give off body roll compared to my winter tires. Which is very odd considering the V rating on the tire. They do give slight nose but not bad. So far not too bad in the rain but I prefer the Achille Sport over these tires in rain and HANDLING anyday.NOW for the seller of these tires I am very disgusted with them. They listed 2 tires for a price and stated there were 2 tires per set. So i Ordered 2 sets totaling 4 tires. Upon receiving the tires I only get 2 tires total. I have emailed them and they are a very huge company and after I tell them my situation they replay back that it was an error and they will not make it right. That is misleading customers in every way possible and then no attempt to fix the situation. I had to order 2 more tires from another company to match these to have a full set of 4 to put on my subaru awd car. I am contacting the BBB with a complaint and I have my attorney provided with every piece of information that backs up my statement here. So buyers BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY. THEY ONLY INTEND TO MISLEAD CUSTOMERS AND REFUSE TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED ! ! !",
