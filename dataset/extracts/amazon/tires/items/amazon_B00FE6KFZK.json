The Goodyear Blimp is a familiar sight for millions of people, an iconic advertising device that also provides great aerial views of football games and events. Whether you\u2019re looking for passenger, light truck, commercial, agricultural, industrial, or racing tires, Goodyear\u2019s reputation for quality and performance makes them the perfect choice.",

                "reviewText": "I've owned many UHP tires over the years and these are by far the best. Handling is amazing. There's very little sidewall flex and these tires grip curves like you wouldn't believe. The warmer it is the better they work. I have used these during snow and they are sufficient. I have never gotten stuck in the slick stuff but I would not recommend trotting through a foot of snow. The tread life is not the best but the benefits completely outweigh this. They produce minimal road noise. I've probably had about a dozen sets of these tires since 2015 and never had any defects or issues. They also have that nifty rim protector to minimize curb damage if you have a tendency to scrape while parking. I purchased the 225 45 17. Taught myself how to mount them myself and they went on quite easily despite being stiffer than a regular all season. I will buy these tires until the end of time.",
