Mine did, I just didn't check ;-)In case that helps someone, if you have an AsRock motherboard that does not power up the power supply, it's likely not the power supply, but the coin cell battery on the motherboard that is dead.

Using a SATA-powered PWM hub, this connector allows me to keep the hub online and the fans running at full speed during operation of the CNC and laser-cutter.For the custom-built Mac Mini mini-rack, this allows me to run an SFX PSU within the chassis of the rack and draw intake to the base of the Mac Mini, driving exhaust through the backplate at a faster rate.",
