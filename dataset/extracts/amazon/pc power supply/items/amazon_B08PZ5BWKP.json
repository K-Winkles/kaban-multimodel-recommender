                "reviewText": "Packaged well, everything supposed to be included was in the box, combs were in a bag, cables were loose but snug in the box.Points deducted for how flimsy they are, it made routing simple but the actual look suffered, and when you're purchasing something like cable extensions you're literally only after aesthetic. There was also a tag attached to one cable on each extension which isn't problematic but had to dig around and find a blade to cut them which seemed unnecessary.It's not pictured well but the PCIe 6+2 is in fact separate, so if you need a 6 pin it is absolutely doable, but you lose one strip of Blue cable.Overall at this price point ($20) if I was purchasing cables again I'd probably look around for something stiffer.",
