It seems physically well made - the cable jacket evenly covers all the wires and connectors click in easily. On the power side I'm using a 12V/1.5A brick from a hard drive which should be plenty to power the 0.42A rating on the fan. The fan spins up smoothly and quickly as soon as I click the switch over to on and continues on until switched off, so there's not a lot more to look at. Does what it says!",

On my unit the Dupont pins weren't fully engaged in the fan header pins were pushed out of the socket when I plugged in a fan. This could have short circuited the power supply.Check contacts before plugging this in to anything you love.",
