                "reviewText": "I recently completed my first build in a number of years, and wanted to put more effort into cable management than I had in previous attempts. I bought these to help counter the very stiff cables that came with my power supply, and over all I'm super happy with the purchase! The cables came packed super simple, just a standard cardboard box with very little in the way of documentation. The cable combs are also not preinstalled, and with 4+ combs per cable It does take a little time to get them all aligned, but the results are great. The cables look nice, and are way more flexible than the ones that came with the PSU. The one exception is the 12vhpwr cable, which again works great, but is still fairly stiff. I'd be careful to make sure that there's a decent amount of space between your graphics card and the wall of your case so that the cable isn't getting overly strained. Keeping that one demerit in mind, I'd still say that these are an easy 4.5/5 and would totally recommend!",
