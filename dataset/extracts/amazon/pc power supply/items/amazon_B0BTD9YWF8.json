                "reviewText": "This are fine for a low cost 24 pin extension, though I did have a bit of trouble with the ends after bending. The end that connects on the MB side kept popping off so I had to take a zip tie and snug it down to make it work right and not pop out. RGB was pretty easy to hook up and looks great.",

                "reviewText": "This is the third 24 pin RGB cable I have tried, but the first from ASIAHORSE. Of the two others from another brand, only one actually arrived and that one didn't even work. So, needless to say, my expectations were as low as possible. However, I do have some experience with the ASIAHORSE brand as I have some of their RGB fans as well as some braided PSU extension cables and all have been pretty good, so I figured this cable extension should be decent. And that was a correct assessment. The lighting is reasonably bright and uniform. And the cable itself is nice and flexible. And that flex is part of the issue I have. Because the cables are so flexible, they don't maintain their position very well and as there is only a single cable comb included, it makes getting the cables to stay neat behind the LED ribbon a bit of a struggle. I would have preferred if there were 2 or 3 combs and/or having the cables be a bit more rigid.ASIAHORSE is a brand that I've begin to trust and this product it no exception to that. If your are looking to add a bit of lighting flair to your case, this cable extension will do just that.",
