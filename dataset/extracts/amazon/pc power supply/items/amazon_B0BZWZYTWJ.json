                "reviewText": "I went with ASUS TUF brand for my PC since I wanted it to be as TUF as possible (heh). I almost went another brand, but decided to try this. I went 850 watt so I didn't have to use too much % of PSU power like I would with a 750 watt. I was very pleased with the build quality. It doesn't have the fancy velcro (whoever uses those really?) pouch for the modular cables like other brands do, just a thick clear plastic bag. This is the most expensive PSU I have ever bought.The wires are unlike any PSU I've installed in my life, all the cables are not glued together into one strip like other brands. It's both a good and bad thing. Good thing is I can choose exactly where the tension is going to be on the cables, the bad thing is that they can get very unruly like a stack of Christmas lights if you aren't careful. BUT that doesn't mean I like it less.This fan also needs to be installed upside-down if you want the fan taking cool air in from the bottom and blowing out the back. If you point the fan up it will suck air from inside the PC and blow it out the back instead. I chose option one (upside-down) because I don't want the PSU eating hot air from the case. I\u2019m not someone who places my PC case on a carpeting and is stuck with option 2.The \u201cbad\u201d thing about this PSU is that the fan is very loud and makes a loud \"humming\" noise (look up '250 HZ sine wave' video, it's about that tone) when it heats up even a teeny bit. There is no low db mode, but it is usually quiet. I'm used to the sound already, but it caught me off guard- easily the loudest PSU I ever bought.Setting my two front intake case fans to DC mode so they turn off at 35\u00b0C seemed to quiet down the PSU A LOT though. I did the same thing for my GPU fans. Did wonders for the noise! Temps are still in the low 30s even with only the CPU and back fan on. I might even turn off my ARBG to see if it gets even quieter (I doubt it though since LEDs take practically nothing to power). The humming is not ideal though. It can sound like a bad case of tinnitus after a while. During gaming (which is usually what I do), it\u2019s not even noticable.Do I regret my buy? Nope. Will I get a different brand next time? Only if the ASUS TUF one fails on me in under 10 years (my old PC's PSU is still going after 12 years).",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve picked Asus for years because it\u2019s never let me down. I upgraded to this discounted 850w Gold from a 600w, and it\u2019s working absolutely beautifully. It is exceptionally well made.It has two different pcie cords you can use, Velcro for cable management, zip ties, and screws for the power supply. It also has a manual, a certificate of authenticity, and a thick power cord that feels well made.I didn\u2019t see a 4 pin connector (two six pins, maybe you\u2019re supposed to split one somehow?), but I don\u2019t mind since it has the 6 pin for the processor on the motherboard. Installing this power supply went very smoothly, and it was extremely easy to do so. The cables aren\u2019t hard to manage by any means. These are braided cables, which I found high quality.As far as noise goes, it is incredibly quiet. I don\u2019t hear it at all in my system. It is likely drowned out by the air cooler and 5 separate fans.The seller shipped it fast considering the timing (near Christmas essentially), and it arrived with fedex. I would buy from the seller again.",

Now I wanted to just install it asap with my new AIO and just wait to plug and play when my GPU arrives but only to realize that I don't have enough connections and I cannot use my old pcie cords as it seems the ports are proprietary to asus it self and I had corsair.",

                "reviewText": "What would have been nice is to be able to see the cable connections, how many and what kind. Had no idea that the dual PCI-e cable plugged into the 16 pin slot on the PSU, so there are enough spots for cpu and pci-e but you wouldn't know that from any info or pics from Amazon or Asus. Both dropped the ball on that one. Just so the rest of you know that odd dual end PCI-e cable that goes into one PSU connection, it has a 16 pin connector at PSU so you'll have plenty of power from that one cable to run most any 3080 or below I'm guessing. Great idea but sharing it would have made it even better. The cables themselves look cool however I truly believe that I could cable manage mercury in a tin pie plate easier than those, they have a mind of their own and no combs to tame them.",

It has all the key features you'd expect from a high end PSU. My only gripe is that when you run up the wattage, the PSU fan runs full blast like a jet engine. It really is LOUD - let me reiterate this again. -it is really, really LOUD.Most PC users only use little to moderate wattage but I run multiple RAID setup, 3 monitors and use a Radeon 7900 XTX. When I actually game AAA titles, the PSU is really loud. That's the only bad thing I have come across on this PSU.Otherwise, I highly recommend buying it.",
