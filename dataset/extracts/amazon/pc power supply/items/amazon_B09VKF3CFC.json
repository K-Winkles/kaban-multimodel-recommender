                "reviewText": "If you need a strong (1200+ watt) power supply Gigabyte will serve you well. We use their 850 watt units for our \"normal\" builds and often will use the 900 watt silver for a little more power and still remain economic. Most of our builds are high-end so normally will will use the platinum/titanium version of any brand PSU. This is one of the better high wattage units we have seen. Be careful with it as the PSU side of the main motherboard cable is unique to this unit and then merges into a \"regular\" 24 pin plug for your motherboard, so don't substitute a 24 pin cable you have laying around.One caveat - I would not recommend using anything below 16 Gauge cables for these higher wattage PSUs. Not every maker supplies that gauge cables as most will give you 18 gauge. I did notice with a 1600 watt Evga we just used those cables were 16 gauge. We often get custom length/color cables for our builds so it has not been much of an issue with us.",

                "reviewText": "I would give 0 stars if I could. Fried half my computer after installing it and rerouting all the cables all night. I had a power supply installed before this one that worked perfectly fine. I installed this one with all the new cables that came with it and everything. Did everything right and it wouldn\u2019t turn on. I realized after troubleshooting that the psu wasn\u2019t turning on when the sata cables were plugged in. So I unplugged them and it turns on fine. Just no power to USB\u2019s and peripherals. I then started trying to see what was wrong with the Sata cables THEY PROVIDED and the system flashed red and made a shock noise. It fried my NZXT Kraken AIO, all my rgb hubs, my hard drive, and my Lian li cables. 0/10 would never buy something from gigabyte again after this. Customer support was also useless. Good luck proving to them their psu fried your computer. You\u2019re gonna have to send it in, wait for an analysis of the psu and then MAYBE get to talk to someone about it past just refunding the psu which Amazon can do right now. Trash PSU and trash company.",
