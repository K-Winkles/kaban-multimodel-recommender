                "reviewText": "This power supply works fine... under a light load. Which is why I spent over a year trying to figure out why my computer would lock up and freeze at random when completing heavy graphics load tasks like gaming, livestreaming, and rendering 3D models, but benchmark tests continued to indicate my GPU, CPU, etc. were fine.Turns out this power supply often fails when the power draw spikes (a notorious problem with the NVIDIA 30 series) and rather than completely shutting down, it would hang and could only be resolved with a hard reset. Replacing the power supply with another brand completely resolved the problem.",

                "reviewText": "Had a 650w Corsair previously without any issues, but added another GPU so needed to go up a size for my PSU. Thought I'd give this unit a try because of the price point. Well I wasted my money for sure, PC now blips out every 20 minutes. Reverted to the old Corsair which is running things again however according to my watt meter it is maximized right now. Looks like I am upgrading \"again\" very soon. Wouldn't suggest this power supply for anything. Giving it a 2 star only because it turns on, and probably will work for a basic low end PC arrangement.",
