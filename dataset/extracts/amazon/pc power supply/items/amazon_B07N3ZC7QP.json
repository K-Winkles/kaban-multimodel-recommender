                "reviewText": "I work with LF and VLF radio receivers and although that part of the spectrum is already crowded with spurious products from other cheap consumer electronics in a suburban environment, this PSU contributes very high-level spurious products from 200 kHz on up. The spurious signatures only change in frequency between PC ON, Standby, and OFF. The only way to get rid of them is to unplug the PC. My original Dell PSU was very EMI quiet, as most other high-quality switching supplies. My guess is that the primary and secondaries of this unit do not have adequate EMI filtering.",
