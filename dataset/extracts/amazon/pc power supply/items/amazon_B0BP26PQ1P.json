We replaced cables, swapped the CMOS, and reseated everything. The PSU no longer turns on at all.The support is non-existent. I emailed a havn't heard anything back. Also, their website/method of contact seems very sketchy and had to work around some things even to send an email to their general info address. No access to an actual support line. Very very disappointed and would not suggest this product. Ya get what you pay for...",

However, the power cables that came with it are all white, so it matched up the build really well. There's plenty of plugs for everything and then some With 1250W, there's plenty of overhead in case I want to add anything else to the PC. Let's hope this power supply lasts a lifetime.",
