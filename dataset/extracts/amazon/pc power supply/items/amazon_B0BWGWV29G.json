                "reviewText": "Rating: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50The ROG Thor 1200W Platinum II, a fully modular power supply, sets the gold standard for power supplies in the world of PC gaming and enthusiast builds.Pros: 1. Massive Power Output: The 1200W power output is more than enough for even the most demanding PC setups. It ensures your components receive a stable and efficient power supply. 2. Fully Modular Design: The fully modular design allows you to connect only the cables you need, reducing clutter and improving cable management. This is crucial for building a clean and organized system. 3. 80+ Platinum Efficiency: The 80+ Platinum certification ensures energy efficiency, reducing power consumption and heat generation. It\u2019s an environmentally friendly and cost-effective choice in the long run. 4. ROG Heatsinks: The integrated ROG heatsinks not only look fantastic but also help dissipate heat efficiently, ensuring the power supply runs cool under heavy loads. 5.

Sleeved Cables: The included sleeved cables not only contribute to a clean and stylish look but also ensure durability and ease of cable management. 7. Aura Sync Compatibility: If you have other Aura Sync-compatible components, the Thor power supply syncs with them, allowing you to create a cohesive and synchronized lighting scheme for your build. 8. Zero Noise in 0dB Mode: The 135mm PWM fan is whisper-quiet, and the 0dB mode ensures that the fan remains off under low loads, further reducing noise levels. 9. Impressive 10-Year Warranty: The 10-year warranty offers peace of mind, showcasing ASUS\u2019s confidence in the power supply\u2019s longevity and performance.Cons: 1.

                "reviewText": "The cables that come with the psu are great. Braided thin and very flexible. The 12vhpwr native cable worked like a charm as well. I wish they would include a 90 degree cable rather than the pcie 12v and the native 12v, but that's ok since I had to order custom cables anyways. If you are using a case in the 20l or above range you should be fine. I'm using a 15l case and had to order custom cables because these are too long to manage with what I have crammed in there.My biggest worry was noise and coil whine. I watched some reviews that suggested there was bad coil whine on these. I threw a sustained 800w load at this (1000w PSU variant) and heard 0 whine. Fan was quiet as well and follows a pretty good fan less design until a high internal temp is picked up. Regular gaming on a 4080 and 7950x the fan started once and it was at a very low rpm.The RGB is whatever. If you don't like it, just don't plug in the RGB cable to the PSU and it won't turn on.Psu itself looks great. If it's viewable from the outside, it should add rather than detract from the aesthetic.",

                "reviewText": "I have had good experience with several Corsair and Seasonic PSU's over the years. This ASUS PSU caught my attention because of its OLED display and beautiful style. Knowing this is a custom PSU made by Seasonic, I was confident this would be a high quality product.The PSU comes with a 16-pin 12vhpwr cable and works perfectly with ASUS ROG Strix RTX 4090. So far I have seen maximum overall power draw at 650W and the PSU is silent. I leave the hybrid fan on since RTX 4090 can draw quite a bit of power. This PSU is expensive but I think it's worth it in my experience. I wish I had bought it sooner at a lower price.",

                "reviewText": "Compre este PSU para remplazar una Cooler Master de 1000w que ya tenia conmigo poco mas de 11 a\u00f1os. Pese a que hay opciones mas baratas para una fuente de 850w decid\u00ed comprar esta por su aspecto visual.Llevo poco mas de un mes de uso y es excelente. Es muy silenciosa y est\u00e9ticamente se ve genial. Venia con los cables y aditamentos descritos en su caja e incluso con un cable de 12 pines para las nuevas tarjetas de Nvidia (fue vendido por amazon de M\u00e9xico).Muy satisfecho con la compra llego en perfectas condiciones y antes del tiempo mencionado.",

                "reviewText": "I recently upgraded my system with the ASUS ROG Loki SFX-L 850W Platinum White Edition power supply, replacing my Corsair RM850, and the difference is remarkable. The first thing that stood out was its size - it's about two-thirds smaller than a standard PSU, making it a perfect fit for compact builds without compromising on power.This power supply comes with an adapter plate, which was a handy addition, and the cables are impressively flexible. This flexibility made cable management a breeze, allowing for a clean, well-organized setup. The design complements my all-white Y60 build perfectly, adding to the aesthetic while delivering robust performance.The 80+ Platinum efficiency is a testament to its quality, ensuring optimal power usage and reduced heat generation. The 120mm fan keeps it running cool and quiet, a significant plus for any build. Additionally, the PCIe-5 connector worked seamlessly with my GeForce RTX 4080, providing stable and reliable power for high-end gaming.In summary, the ASUS ROG Loki SFX-L 850W Platinum White Edition is an exceptional power supply unit. Its compact size, high flexibility, and superb performance make it an excellent choice for anyone looking to build a sleek, powerful, and well-managed system. It's a phenomenal piece of hardware that I would highly recommend.",
