                "reviewText": "My computers are typically on and operating 24x7x365, so power efficiency is a major factor in my choice of power supply, and one of the reasons I like the Platinum power supplies and the Thermaltake power supplies.As an example, with an i7-12700 (no suffix letter), ASUS ROG STRIX Z690-E motherboard, 64 GB RAM, two Samsung EVO 980 Pro 2 TB NVMe SSDs, a Toshiba 14 TB enterprise drive, and an ASUS ROG STRIX 4080 OC 16 GB video card, when the computer is idling, the computer draws only 86 watts. Of course, when rendering UHD video files or gaming, it ramps up to a significant power draw.The point is, the efficiency of the Thermaltake Toughpower Grand RGB 1200W 80+ Platinum power supply helps keep the power demands low.In addition, the power supply fits very nicely at the bottom of the case, and as a modular power supply, comes with a bag containing a wide variety of modular connectors and a power supply panel with many power connectors. There is even a power connector for a floppy disk drive. The ASUS ROG STRIX 4080 card requires THREE power cables from the power supply, and this power supply has more than enough power connections and cables. I originally had planned to get a 1000 watt power supply (or thereabouts), but at the time the 1200 watt was approximately the same price as the 1000 watt, was shipping immediately, and would easily power additional internal drives and peripherals.",

Usually its a 50/50 chance with these PSUs but you still may run into a DOA( Dead on arrival). So far after 1 year use and being used ALOT. this thing continues to work amazingly. Im about to push this thing WAY HARDER. Im about to build a crazy huge PC that will have 30 FANS AND 2 WATER PUMPS. It will also be powering lots of RGB devices and a i9-10900k chip on a msi MEG z490 MB with a MSI Geforce RTX 2080ti Trio GPU and of course that will be a RGB waterblock soon too! Cant wait to see how this holds up after the stress tests and overclocking! Update down below soonUPDATE! : SOON",

Can't find any way to control the color but in this installation the fan side is not visible so it is really not an issue. Quality cables and plenty of them are in the box so you won't go wanting there. Soon the manufacturers should be cutting down on cables with Nvidia's new GPUs connected with one 12+4 cable and most new boards having slots for 3-5 NVMe M.2 so SATA & PCIe wires are not so numerous. This build only has one SATA connection and that to the water pump, no HDD or even 2.5 SSDs. The way of the future.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Dead after only 14 months of use + Unreliable PSU",
                "reviewText": "I bought this PSU back in Jan 2021. I got the Thermaltake ToughPower 1050 W 80+ Platinum model for my custom build workstation. I am an engineer and was only planning to do some rendering beside my other engineering software usage (so nothing crazy like over clocking the CPU or GPU, VGA Crossfire, etc.).Based on my workstation configuration I did the total estimated wattage calculation (using the PC Part Picker tool) and figured out I need a PSU above 800 W. To have some overhead, I decided to go with a 1050 W PSU. As Thermaltake\u2019s PSU history is not in par with the other big names (Seasonic, EVGA, etc.) I spent a good time to read online reviews for it and finally decided to buy it. However, after only few months of usage I experienced some issues. For instance my computer would shutdown once in a while and sometimes it would freeze completely and I had to do a hard restart. After almost 6 months of usage I started hearing a clicking noise (more like a weak beeping noise). Also, I did isolate all the other components to make sure it is the PSU and not the motherboard. Eventually, after 14 month of use, one day I saw there is no power going into my workstation. So I just went to a PC hardware store and bought a new PSU and you guessed it, the problem was the PSU. I am happy at least it didn\u2019t damage my Motherboard.My recommendation is that to stick with more reputable names. The price for this unit is not cheap at all and goes in the same price range of Seasonic and EVGA, so why to take the risk and buy this PSU. I am going to claim the warranty, however I couldn\u2019t wait for a month for the repair or to get a replacement, so I had to spend $300 to buy a new one and even if TT gets the PSU fixed I would be left with an extra one. I am very disappointed with Thermaltake\u2019s PSUs.",

And the wiring bundle included is in a cool little velcro pouch. Ok done ranting about the product packaging lol.Functionality is, it does what it say's.I mean it's a PSU. Works good as far as I can tell.I'm using a dual chamber case so the rgb doesn't matter to me but would be kinda cool effect for those with normal case's.I bought this PSU over other 1200 watt's simply for the price to performance.
