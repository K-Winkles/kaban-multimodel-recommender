                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars FAR better than I expected for the base model PSU (400W). Voltages are stable and accurate at idle or under load. A+",
                "reviewText": "I'll admit I didn't have high hopes for this PSU, and was going to buy the Rosewill with a longer warranty for just $2 more, but it was going to take 5 days (with Prime--Amazon is getting a little lax in the shipping times--what happened to 2-day shipping?), so I ordered this instead since I could get it next day. I was replacing a mediocre 500W Coolmax power supply that had been in the PC, which runs 24/7, for 9 years non-stop. But it had become unstable and the MOSFETs were whistling. Luckily the ASUS motherboard shut itself down when it detected surges in the PSU 3.3v and 5v rails (not even in the 12v where it would be expected). So I had days to get it back running, and this was the quickest I could get a PSU.And I'm quite surprised. I never needed the 500w the old one was allegedly capable of, since this is just a PC that has operated as a media center since 2011 with just an AMD Phenom II X4 Black Edition with a basic GeForce 710 card in it and 3 spinning hard disks internally plus a bunch of USB accessories. Not massive power requirements, and 400W is more than enough.So on to the new PSU. First, it's the closest to spec I've ever seen in a PSU that isn't a top of the line 80PLUS Gold & Platinum certified models. Vcore obviously fluctuates since it is variable and why it's only 0.9V in the screenshot, but the 3.3V, +12V, and +5V readings are what I get from either the BIOS (so no system load) or even under load in Windows. The +5V has been between 4.97V and 5.04V (the old Coolmax was usually at 6V), while the +3.3V doesn't change but a few hundredths of a volt. The +12V, which is just a single rail compared to the dual rail of the old Coolmax, hasn't dipped below 12V at all, with it mostly sitting between 12.05-12.30V, with it fluctuating a bit more since the 12V rail gets a lot of use. The Coolmax never put out below 12.4V for the 12V rails, with it fluctuating pretty wildly between 12.4V and 13.6V depending on load.This thing so far has been rock stable for voltages. I was able to undervolt my CPU, RAM, and NB by a pretty significant amount compared to the setup I had. Now the CPU runs about 4\u00b0C cooler on average due to the lower and more stable voltage. And the PSU itself barely puts out any heat at all, and you can't hear the fan at all (unless you have no other fans in your case, at which point you would hear the fan. But it's very quiet even at full load.All in all, this base model 400N1 power supply has been amazing. If it lasts me only the 2 years of the warranty, I'd be a bit disappointed though not upset, but if it made it 5 years or more, even better.Still, I just can't believe how stable the voltages are and how close to spec they are. Now everything runs cooler and more efficiently. I would definitely try another EVGA power supply, even with the negative stories I've heard.The only downside would be that the SATA power rail doesn't have a ton of distance between the first and last connector, meaning in a tall case, it won't reach from the top optical drive down to a hard drive at the bottom. Luckily my DVDR drive has both SATA and molex on it, so it didn't ruin the day (since adapters on PSUs almost always fail catastrophically, I never use them). But if you need the SATA ports to stretch from the top of a mid-tower case to the bottom, this might get tight.I'm impressed overall. Never thought I'd be impressed by a base model, $30, 400W power supply, but I definitely am. Now if it doesn't fail in the first few years, it really will be my favorite PSU.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this to replace a 300 Watt supply in a Dell Inspiron ATX computer. I have used EVGA power supplies in the past with great success. This power supply cured the problem of the computer would not power up unless AC power was applied to the computer for 5 to 10 minutes before use. It was as if there was a warm-up time for the old one. No problem with this power supply.During installation I could not find the 4-pin square connector that goes to the motherboard. To my surprise the 8-pin connector is actually two 4-pin connectors that are kind-of tongue and grooved together. Slide them apart and there is the needed connector.This power supply had an ample amount of both Molex 4-pin and SATA device connections that should cover most any situation. I needed 4 SATA style connectors. The other brands I looked at did not have enough SATA device connectors.I will buy another one of these to have on hand for a future project. It works great !!!",

                "reviewText": "The psu is only 400w but still overkill for the R5 5600g build in a small budget case and with the larg fan very quietAlso like how the wires are going in to the sata power connectors making them easy to plug in to surface mounted ssd drivesYea it has mustard and catchup cables but hay it evga quality but still a very cheep budget priceMy computer will not see a video card as i will be using the IGPU on the processor and is why a quality 250w psu would have been plenty and this 400w is overkill. not a fan boy but evga has a name and reputation of standing behind there stuff so if they happen to have there name on a product i am looking for I feel confident when buy it.update 2/10/22 been a wile and when the RX6500xt came out I snagged me a card for $199 and wow 4 times faster than the IGPU and this little 400w is still chugging along with ease ....still quiet still working and system never crashes knock on wood and i game quiet a bit on it and very happy with this PSY from EVGA and yes still has Mustered and Catchup cables :-) but nothing a few cable mods cant fix .here is a pic of the computer it is in and working fantastic ...... :-)",

                "reviewText": "I purchased the EVGA 750 N1 to replace a failed power supply in an old Dell XPS 8300. The original PS was only a 460 Watt ATX power supply but had a higher than usual combined power of 142Watts on the +3.3V and +5V rails. It is nearly impossible to find a new power supply in the 500W range that meets this requirement, and is rather difficult even at the 750W level. Fortunately, this model fits the bill with a combined rating of 150W on the +3.3V and +5V rails and a great price.The product arrived from Amazon in one day and was well packed. The retail packaging was typical high quality you can expect from EVGA.The power supply itself looks great with a matte black finish and nicely wrapped cables. There are plenty of cables available for most modern builds, and the cable length should be adequate for any mid-tower builds.Installation was a breeze as the EVGA power supply matched the size and fit of the original Dell power supply. Once all power connectors were made within the case, and the extra cables tucked away under the optical drive I powered on the system. Everything worked as expected, but, as an added bonus, I did notice that the new power supply was much quieter than the old one was.All in all, this was a great experience with great service from Amazon and a great product from EVGA.",

                "reviewText": "Esta es una fuente incomprendida, ya que he o\u00eddo a bastantes youtubers e influencers echarle tierra y decir que esta fuente es basura o que es una fuente gen\u00e9rica, y pues la verdad se equivocan. En primera, muchos se quejan de que esta fuente no tiene certificaciones (por ejemplo bronce 80 o cosas asi), estas lo unico que significa es que la fuente tendr\u00e1 menos perdidas de energ\u00eda por calor (si, lo unico), esta fuente tiene una eficiencia del 75 % (si no me creen revisen el manual), lo cual la hace una fuente normal o promedio; estos n\u00fameros al final del d\u00eda solo quieren decir que tanta energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica consumir\u00e1 tu computadora. Teniendo un 75 % de eficiencia tu computadora consumir\u00e1 lo mismo que una computadora promedio, as\u00ed que no te asustes. Otro punto que tocan es que esta fuente dice que te proporciona 750 Watts a 25\u00b0C de temperatura ambiente a -carga completa-, eso quiere decir que, si vas a usar todos los 750 Watts de tu fuente, asegurate de tener la PC en un lugar fresco y por debajo de los 25\u00b0C, pero si no vas a usar completos los 750 Watts ni te preocupes que no te afectar\u00e1. Otro punto que no nombran esos desinformadores son las protecciones con las que cuenta esta fuente, que no cualquier fuente gen\u00e9rica las trae, estas son: Protecci\u00f3n desobre voltaje (Over Voltage Protection, OVP), Protecci\u00f3n de sobrecarga de energ\u00eda (Over Power Protection, OPP),protecci\u00f3n contra cortocircuitos (Short Circuit Protection, SCP), Protecci\u00f3n Contra Altas Temperaturas(Over Temperature Protection, OTP), Protecci\u00f3n de sobrecarga de corriente (Over Current Protection, OCP) que ya hacen sobresalir a esta fuente de las demas fuentes \"normales\". Otro punto que tampoco dicen es que el fabricante te da 2 a\u00f1os de garant\u00eda. Y por ultimo, la electr\u00f3nica que se ve a trav\u00e9s de las rendijas no es de una fuente \"gen\u00e9rica\" como muchos dicen, se ven componentes de buena calidad. En conclusi\u00f3n: Vale la pena esta fuente, ya que Amazon la da al precio (incluy\u00e9ndole el 16 % de IVA para M\u00e9xico) que aparece en la web de EVGA y la relacion costo-watts creo que es bastante buena. La recomiendo ampliamente.",
