Had done everything to try to get it to work but upon pressing the power button PC would not do anything - last leg of the journey was to check the PSU.This unit is simple and cheap. I plugged in the 24 pin header and right away it told me everything was working and showed the voltage levels. I then plugged in the CPU 8-pin header and it showed also to be functioning correctly.PROS: Easy and self evident to use - saved me tons of time. Inexpensive yet solid contruction (metal case)CONS: Manual is minimilistic and in tiny font. Don't know how ling it will last.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this PSU checker while I was building a new PC. It was nice to be able to diagnose the PSU independent of everything else in the system. Note, however, that the error limits seem to be a bit oversensitive, or perhaps the standards that it compares the values to don't reflect actual fault conditions. I tested multiple \"fresh from the box\" power supplies and they all gave essentially the same results, and the tester was beeping like crazy because the \"-12V\" value was -13.3V and the \"PG\" value was 120 on every single one of the brand new power supplies. Despite this, the power supplies actually work fine. Every other test result was dead on the expected value.",

                "reviewText": "Just went through this with a computer in the shop. Computer went down and wouldn't power up. Assumed the power supply was the culprit. So I ordered a new supply but still wondered if the old one was OK. I got this tester and as it turns out the supply IS OK, turned out one of the pins was backing out of the molex connector. It was much easier to figure this out without using the computer as a tester. Very simple to use. I should have gotten one of these things a long time ago.",
