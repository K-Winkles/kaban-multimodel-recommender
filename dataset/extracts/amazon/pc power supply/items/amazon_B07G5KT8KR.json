There are 2 groups of SATA Power Connectors on the original as well as this replacement (a group = a string of wires which go to one or more SATA connectors). BUT the distance between the last 2 SATA Power Connectors on one of the groups was too short so I could not connect the second disk drive. Instead I used the other group (which should have gone to the CD/DVD bay) to connect the second drive. Result: The computer is working but I don't have a working CD/DVD drive. That is not a problem for my use but if it is for your intended use you should be aware of this.",

                "reviewText": "My Inspiron 3847 was noisy and dying from chattering bearings in the fan. I was overjoyed when Amazon came up with a \"compatible replacement\" for an affordable price. Everything fitted except, alas, the connection for the 2 disks. In the replacement, the connectors were straight with the wires, but my 3847 takes connectors 90 degree from the wires. I could start up my C-drive, but the lid of the computer wouldn't close. My second disk was even worse. The wires were too short to reach it.The obvious solution was to cut the connection wiring from my dying power supply and splice it into the new power supply, but that was scary. If the transplant failed, I would have gone from a noisy and dying computer to no computer at all.I decided I really had to risk it. I cut the wires long enough from my old power supply so that in the transplant the wires were plenty long enough. I cut one wire at a time from the old power supply and spliced it into the new one using crimp connectors and a nice crimping tool.What a relief when everything worked. I now have an Inspiron 3847 that works and sounds like new.My enthusiastic thanks to Amazon for making this happy ending possible. However, I fear that many possible customers have no idea what a crimping tool is and are not prepared to learn. They may find the replacement not compatible.",
