Worked great with my 1080ti 7700k. Now using a 3080 and it still works amazing but the fan is noticeably louder since its dealing with more power from the beefy graphics card. I was able to undervolt it to keep noise levels down. Great budget psu for a powerful card.",

                "reviewText": "Got this to replace a 10-year old 600W Rosewill power supply that finally gave up the ghost.Overall, I'm pretty happy with this unit. It is functioning fine and solved some stability issues I was having (I'm guessing the old PSU was acting up in general before it completely went out). It's semi-modular, meaning that the cables for the motherboard and one video card are permanently attached, which is mostly fine as nearly everyone will need those.It was a little disappointing in that they don't include cables for all the plugs: there are 2 PERIF plugs, 2 VGA, 1 CPU, and 2 SATA, however they only include 1 PERIF, 2 SATA, and 1 VGA cables. If you want to use the additional plugs you'll need to buy additional cables. That wasn't a problem for me as the included cables were sufficient for all of my devices (barely), but if you do end up buying additional cables be VERY careful as they're not universal between power supplies - often even within a manufacturer's own product line.Other than that though, the unit is performing great, and it even includes a few nice to have \"goodies\" like a jumper to force the unit on for testing, screws, and velcro cable wraps.",

                "reviewText": "Overall it\u2019s a good budget semi-module PSU for 650W. However, the cables are a bit too short, especially for the CPU cable. I\u2019m using the Cooler Master TD500 Mesh case and the cable length is barely enough. The PSU also has a slot for the CPU2 cable for overclocking on higher-end motherboards, but the package only comes with 1 CPU cable, meaning you either have to buy an extra cable or get the 750W version.",

Looks good, quiet, no fires.I got it mostly to match my orange Ryzen build. Semi modular makes for a cleaner install. All black wires look good anywhere.Sleeved cables feel qaulity. Bronze level efficiency is nice for the power bill.Wish the VGA cable was modular, it's got a 6+2 with additional +6 end that can make a super clean look difficult.Can flip it either fan up or down and the writing stays upright, which is a nice detail.It's bronze/orange colour",

I was looking to save money at the time, and if you are as well, look no further. Installation may be a bit difficult in some smaller cases, i used a fractal design meshify c and it was easy enough.",
