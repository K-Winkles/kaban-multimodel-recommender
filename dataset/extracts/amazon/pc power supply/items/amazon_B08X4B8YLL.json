                "reviewText": "Recently I decided to revive my computing activity. With poor eyesight and other limitations, I needed 4K resolution. I am an old Unix engineer, so Linux/FreeBSD were the obvious choice, Gaming is totally unimportant to me but gaming specific hardware tends to be high performance and better quality than price-is-everything \"consumer\" hardware, this was the way I chose. Knowing what I plan to have and do on the system, I figured out about 450W PSU will be about right. Thus, I looked for something almost twice as big (there IS such a thing as PSU too large). The best price in the 700W range, with the best feature set was this unit and another, almost identical. This one just sounded better. Mainly better in terms of more honest advertising. AS a long term Amazon Prime customer, I have to option to return anything I choose to. I rarely do, but with a component as critical as a PSU, I wanted this option. The unit I ordered arrived soon, in excellent condition, and appeared very well made. Several weeks later, my high regard for this unit has not changed. It works perfectly well, very quiet and cool running. My system has 2 server class 4TB drives, 1 SSD, 2 M.2 NVMe (black WD 500G), 32MiB RAM, 8 cores AMD overclocked 10% (RAM is overclocked 18%), water cooling, 7 fans, lots of lights (my grandchild loves them), and I do not think the PSU is even trying hard. I should put some instruments on it, but what the O/S and the BIOS are both telling me is indistinguishable from idle.So there, if you want a mid-power PSU for a hot system, try this one. You should be very happy.And no, I am not being paid for this review.",

                "reviewText": "This is amazingly reliable. I had a Vega64 and a 650watt PSU, and it was shutting off at random times when gaming. I was told it was the GPUs poor voltage regulation, which made the power micro-spike to almost 600watts and was the issue. It was recommended to get a 700-watt unit. Well, this unit was $20 less and 50 more watts and still gold rated. It was during the pandemic and PSUs were on short supply, so I had to choose between two unknown PSUs.I made the right choice. My system was using between 600-700 watts a lot. It has been almost a full year now and it hasn't worked up a sweat. The PSU runs cool and reliable.Pleasantly surprised to say the least. I thought for sure I would have an issue or two. But smooth sailing for me.The modular cabling is awesome for management. Even if they are a little too long. But I guess it is better than too short. Yikes. Plus I can remove the extra cables I don't need, to make room for the long cables that are in it.I hope ApexGmaing can keep up the good work.",
