It's a fairly decent build quality for such a cheap power supply.Cables and connections all feel higher quality than whatever OEM Dell PSU lived in my PC before. Installed perfect, booted perfect. The 3-year warrenty says a lot about the components you can't see though lol so don't expect long lifespan or stellar performance if your PC is full of more modern components pushing more wattage. Is this a useful power supply for some folks in some situations? Yes. Is it low teir? Also yes. But hey, if your expectations are in line with the reality of it's flaws, it does the job just fine.",

Luckily the seller sent it incredibly fast and it worked well right away. Its not noisy at all, which would have been annoying as the build was meant to be quiet. Good power supply for a very good value.",
