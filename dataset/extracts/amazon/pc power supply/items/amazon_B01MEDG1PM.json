It is much quieter than my last power supply but not as quiet as I had hoped but still so much better.Update 9/10/2019 - The power supply is still working but now the fan is going out. It is making some very bad noises. Just a few months past warranty so I will probably have to replace the fan myself. I guess you get what you pay for. At least it is still working and as for problems, it is a fairly easy fix. Not going to knock a star off since it did last over a year and is technically still working as is, I just don't trust the fan anymore.",

The power supply came with the correct 4-pin/8-pin 12V EPS power connector and plugged in correctly on my ASUS B450M motherboard. Everything was installed in a Thermaltake Core G3 case and the power supply has been running nicely/quietly for about 3 weeks without any issues.My only complaint is that this PSU does not seem to have any UL or other safety certifications. A little worrisome but we'll see how it does over the long term.",

I did not look carefully at the motherboard before I ordered. Mine is old and needed a 4 pin to cpu plug. This power supply does not have a 4 pin plug, I tried to adapt the 8 pin to it but no good. You need this (StarTech.com 6in LP4 to P4 Auxiliary Power Cable Adapter - LP4 to 4 pin ATX - Molex to P4 Adapter - LP4 to P4 (LP4P4ADAP) if you have the same problem. 5 bucks. It absolutely will not post without it. I thought it was a bad power supply before I tried this work around. Works well with it. Also the power cord needs to be seated super deep otherwise it would not power up as well. It is pretty quiet and runs nicely otherwise. We shall see how long it lasts.",

The first one I ordered had horrible coil whine when powered off (5V standby), so it was extremely noticeable. Decided to reach out to support (Amazon was sold out so couldn't replace). They were extremely responsive and after I sent them some info (serial and copy of invoice), quickly dispatched a new one. Got it 4 days later and it's works great powering my i7 4790k and GTX1070 mini without issue. Fan is a bit louder than I'd like, but that's to be expected for a supply that only goes for $30. It's not horrible.All in all, I was a little disappointed at first with the quality, but their support seems top notch and ultimately got what I needed and quite happy with purchase.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to replace an older failed power supply in a utility PC that mainly handles my security cameras. It worked fine for a few months, then I decided to move the PC to another spot in my house. When I moved it and turned the power supply back on, it made a horrible groaning noise.Prior to failing, it worked OK but was a little noisier than I'd like.Update: After contacting the manufacturer, they replaced the failing supply at no cost to me within 2 days. I didn't even have to ship the old one back. New one is working great. Very happy with the response/service, so I added a star back. Still keeping at 3 stars due to the early failure though.",

                "reviewText": "About a week after the warranty period I noticed the PC was a bit warm. The fan in the power supply was surging. But before I could find another one, it stopped surging. :) I bought a LanLi now that was $100 more expensive. But it was local and I probably will not have to replace it next year. The Apevia is dirt cheap and does the job for a while, but you can't depend on it.",

                "reviewText": "My power supply busted after 17 years, I had kept power supply, case and a few components when I rebuilt this computer a few years ago. I was happy to find an affordable replacement given this computer is used as a server and occasional use only. This new power supply fit perfectly and was easy to install to replace my busted SFX power supply - I am not overly experienced/knowledgeable but not a novice either. My motherboard had only a P4 12v connection but enough room for the P8 from the power supply to connect (leaving 4 pins unconnected in the air) - I'm happy the pin configuration is compatible. It's low noise, although I don't think my set up draws a lot of power to be honest.",
