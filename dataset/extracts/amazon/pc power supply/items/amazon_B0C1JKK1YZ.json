Hooked it all up and worked like a charm. The Thermaltake 650w is more than enough power for my needs and I love that it's fully modular (my previous one was only partially modular). I don't need the PCIe Gen 5 connection for my current build but figured it's nice to have that option for any future upgrades. I've been using Thermaltake parts for the past 13+ years and it's a brand I can trust. In fact, I'm still using my Thermaltake V9 BlacX Edition case that I got back in 2010, which has the 2 hot-swappable docks built-in to the top of the case. Best case ever!!! Very satisfied with the purchase and the brand!Thermaltake, if you're listening, I wouldn't be mad if you sent me some 120mm RGB case fans to test. \ud83d\ude09",

In buying, I realized the I9 processor and the graphics card sucks electricity. I originally purchased an 850 watt power supply. I saw this one go on sale. I believe 1050 watts gives me great headroom for upgrading in the future. I use a RTX 3090 card now, buy I will be moving up to a 4090 soon. This power supply pushes juice to my processor, MB, fans, GPU and CPU. One of my USB ports id a 60 watt fast charger. It charges my cell phone effortlessly. My motherboard also has Thunderbolt, which can push out 240 watts (allegedly).This comes with nice modular connections. It even uses the newer GPU connections. I had a scare while building. I have a table that is bar height. The power supply fell off the table before I got to get in my case. I was nervous. Picked it up and did the normal shake to listen for rattle. Sounded solid. I put it in, connected the wires and nervously turned it on. It turned on. Fan spins and power is flowing.",

I love that it has the PCIe Gen 5 connection for the 4090 and it is a heavy duty cable so no need to worry about it shorting out and no dangling 8pin connector messWord of caution, use only the cables supplied with the unit...others might fit but might not be wired the same or able to handle the output and that will lead to your pc not postingWould highly recommend if you need the extra wattage to run a beast of a graphics card",

I'm running an i7 12400k, air cooler, Gigabyte H610M S2H V2 DDR4 mobo, Noctua Air cooler, 32gb of RAM, 1070ti, 1tb NVMe SSD, and a 2.5in SSD, along with this psu. If I knew more about PC's when I got mine, I would've bought a Corsair PSU, better wattage for the value. Also more upgradable. Overall, pretty quiet and gets the job done. Good modular power supply for beginners for sure.",

                "reviewTitle": "1.0 out of 5 stars Expensive Mistake",
                "reviewText": "PROS:- Seemingly nice PSU- Thermaltake- semi-modular- quiet fan- well packed- nice nylon case to keep unused cables togetherCONS:- unreliable- expensive when it breaksI've used varying models from Thermaltake, Antec, Corsair, Seasonic, Enermax, even OEMs like Sparkle (SPI), and when one of those PSUs went bad, it was usually a loud sound, a loud pop, maybe a flash, some smoke, or even just one last good use, and then the computer wouldn't turn on again.I bought two of these. One of these, didn't afford me the same courtesy as other PSUs did when they die. After 10 months of occasional use with this power supply - maybe once or twice a month, the computer fails to turn on (it turns on then right back off again - not a dust issue, I clean the computer out every 3 to 6 months, no pets, non-smoker). I fiddle with connections related and unrelated to the PSU with no success. And just like that, the problem went away and the computer starts up again, however, 4 SSDs now won't work (all connected to the same peripheral power cable from the PSU, and they don't show up in the BIOS). I pull the drives out and tested them in another machine and also tested them on an external to USB device. All 4 drives (2x Samsungs (diff models), an Intel, and a Cruicial), all fried - literally (opened them up and a chip is melted with scorch marks on the inside of the SSD case). [I previously reported the SATA ports also were damaged, that was incorrect. A subsequent test showed the SATA ports were working fine]. Computer still boots, but it claimed I tried to overclock and reset the values (I didn't overclock anything, I never do)I saw other reviews state it fried their hard drives, DVD, even one customer said that it actually caused their graphics cards to catch fire, another said he tested the peripheral output and saw it jumping to 16v. I'll be honest, with the luck I've had with Thermaltake, I'd have read those reviews, shook my head, and probably said \"eh, they did something to make that happen, these things are legit and solid!\". For thinking that, I apologize.I've seen Thermaltake's response to some other customers - go to our ThermaltakeUSA.zendesk.com site for assistance which amounts to nothing more than warranty service which gets you \"All warranty replacements will be replaced with the same model. Thermaltake will make repairs or send replacements only. We will not accept any requests to exchange, upgrade, or refund.\" So, I'm supposed to get a repair/refurb of the same risky model I had in the first place that cost me$450 in SSDs, and add to that a $75 PSU, because I sure as heck don't want to use that again, fixed or not? I'll probably have to pay for shipping the bad one in too, so add that to the bill. But hey, at least I got a rebate on it, right?Avoid this PSU, I'm upset so my anger might be talking when I say avoid Thermaltake at all costs, but hopefully, maybe you read my situation and consider better choices before buying your next PSU - better than I did. If you have money to burn, or want to take a chance, then best of luck to you.[updated 5/29] emailed Thermaltake customer service - they responded within thirty minutes. They said their policy is strictly to replace a failed PSU with exactly the same model. I didn't matter that I owned 7 PSUs from Thermaltake or that I offered to pay extra to get a model more reliable (I was clear I didn't want it for free). So, as I said earlier, if you chance your equipment with this brand, best of luck to you. I'm done with Thermaltake and hope this review helps others avoid my mistake.[updated 6/5] customer service emailed me an RMA. I asked for a prepaid label. A couple more days went by and they finally responded and said \"no\". Prepaid return labels are only if the equipment breaks in the first 30 days. Kind of nice since most retailers will also take it back in the first 30 days, so maybe that's why they have the policy. In the end, I am deciding not to send it back. The unit cost me over $80, plus over $400 in damage, and then I get the shipping bill of $10-$20 to send it back to probably end up with same unit, probably lacking in quality, as a refurbished model. Less than 10 months use, I bought it brand new, and I get a refurb and an expensive bill. I buy, build, recommend, and consult in computers and IT. Some of you may be familiar with the Thermaltake brand, and have had good luck with them. So did I for the past 15 years or so. But, out of all the PSUs that have failed on me, none of them cost me extra money in additional damage. Sure, cheap ones do, but I don't use cheap PSUs. Other retailers and Amazon list issues with this PSU that possibly shed light on quality or quality control, or both. When I recommend products to friends, co-workers, customers, I would ask them this when they ask for a cheap PSU - do you want a PSU that dies and costs you hundreds to thousands of dollars in damaged equipment, or worse, a fire hazard that threatens your home or business? The answer is almost always, what do you recommend. After this experience, I can say, it won't be Thermaltake anymore and that's too bad because at one time, they made great PSUs and had great quality.",

                "reviewText": "I have a ROG Strix pre built gaming PC and have slowly started upgrading parts. I just purchased a 4070 Super GPU and needed to upgrade the power supply. I came across this one on Amazon and it is a great buy. This comes with the HV12PWR 300w connection for the 4000 series NVidia GPUs which is a huge bonus. Very well packaged, nice heavy duty wires, easy to cable manage with included cable ties and more. You cannot beat the value with price. Only thing I wish they included was a 90\u00b0 SATA power connector as the one that came with it does not fit on my HDD and had to order an additional cable. Other than that, I have no complaints. Seems very well built and of high quality.",
