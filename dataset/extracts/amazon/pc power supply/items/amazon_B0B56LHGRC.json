They take a bit of work, but that was more a case issue rather than the wires themselves. The only real work comes from putting the clips onto the wires, the edges can be sharp and your fingers start to hurt after awhile, which could just be an issue with the set of clips I got.Overall, I highly recommend them if you don't feel like dishing out 4 times as much for a more notable brand that does the same thing.",
