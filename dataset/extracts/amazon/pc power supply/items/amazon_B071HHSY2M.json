While it's not modular the flat ribbon cables make cable management really easy and make tucking the cables behind the motherboard tray a easy chore. Noise level is also great you can hardly hear the fan running.",

Honestly Molex connectors are a thing of the past now and instead of wasting space with molex cables I would suggest adding 1 or 2 sata power to molex adapters instead. Had no issues with this power supply, very clean power delivery.",

I think this PSU had alot of potential but ive had 2 RMAs and both of them had bad fan bearings and produced a terrible noise, it was also the loudest component in my build by far. My build at load is suppose to use around 350 watts so this psu shouldnt even really be pushed. I guess its just bad luck.",
