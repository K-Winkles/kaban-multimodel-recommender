                "reviewText": "I had bought cable extensions at a similar price point ~$25 previously and these do feel a step above those in terms of connector and cable wrap quality. The wires are pretty flexible which was an issue with the other set I had. That set was too stiff with lower quality connections and would eventually shake themselves loose from the PSU cables and result in GPU crashes under load due to imperfect power delivery.Not an issue for me, but the lengths of the 2+6 PCIE wires do appear to be slightly different for the top/bottom 4, which allows for even bends but if you're hoping to have the cable completely straight for some reason, that might be an issue.",

                "reviewText": "Really up the aesthetic and organization of the build. Everything power up fine, but we will have to see how it hold up in the long term.Many review pointed out that cable are uneven, but they are design that way for one way bend/curve. As you bend the longer length suppose to be on top and the shorter on the bottom. This will limit the way you organize your cables and how the build will look. For example, originally I wanted to have the gpu cable extension to come from bottom cut out of the case but I couldn't as the cable only bend one way and the power pins only clip in one way. Therefore, I had to lay them on top the gpu. I could have force the bend and make it work like how I originally wanted but the opposite end cable would be an uneven mess which would ruin the aesthetic and defeat the purpose of this cable. But my build still turn out great, soooo 4 out of 5.",

Please ensure you are buying these with this understanding as the product doesnt tell you which way it bends",
