                "reviewText": "When I first received the package, I was a little worried because it came in a box different than the one shown by ESGAMING. It also had no manual. Fortunately, I've been studying PCs and how they work, so I already know how to connect the cables.The important part to know, for anyone considering this, is it produces very little heat. Even during intense gaming or other heavy workloads, the power supply itself does not produce the majority of the heat. I get more heat from my AMD Radeon GPU and AMD CPU than this power supply! It definitely holds up to its 80 Plus Gold rating.For me, the colored lighting is really just a bonus. Since I have a glass panel on one side of my case, I can see the light from this PSU very well. It has various color options and settings, which are as follows (not necessarily in this order):+ Colors: Multi-colored, red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple, and white.+ Modes: Static, rotating, flashing (fading off and on), cycle through colors (like flashing, except it fades from one color to the next), off.For anyone hoping the RGB lights can be controlled by external software, you're out of luck with this one, as it can only be controlled with the press of a single button. Still, it's an affordable, colorful replacement to any stock, less efficient, or simply older PSUs.",

My old one worked for 10 years or more 24/7. This new one fit just like the old one and works very well so far. The extra light in it is also a nice touch that I did not have in the old one. Everything works like it suppose to.",
