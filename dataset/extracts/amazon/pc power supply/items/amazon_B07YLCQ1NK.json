With all the people online pooping all over Apevia PSUs I was leary, but I'm happy to say that it is working wonderfully. I had a Thermaltake PSU in my system that should have been able to handle the configuration of my computer, but I found out after installing the Apevia PSU that the Thermaltake was junk. Most of the fans in my system were not reaching the full rating of 2000rpm. I installed the Apevia and all my fans are now at their full speed and the volt readings in the BIOS are all were they should be now. I don't know what other people are doing to make these PSUs fail. The only thing I can think of is some people are mixing up the cpu power with the pci-e power and borking things. So, so far all is well and computing along as they should be. If this changes I will update but right now all is well.",

                "reviewText": "The power supply works as advertised, no issues powering the upgrades I made to my PC. I have a slightly built HP Z210 and had to buy an adapter cable to for the main connector to mate with my motherboard. I researched this ahead of time and knew that going in so no issue. The connector I bought also worked well with no issues. The power supply did not mount in the PC case properly so I had to make some modifications, drill some holes, and make a couple small brackets in order to install it. This might be challenging for someone who is not handy with those sorts of things, so keep this in mind if you are buying one for the PC case I mentioned.The only issue I have had thus far, after a couple months of use is that the main 5\" cooling fan failed within 2 weeks. The fan blade assembly melted off the shaft and after some banging, clanging, and some burning smells, the fan no longer functions. I had to remove it and replace it. I examined it and cannot find any reason why it would have melted the way it did, but the fan blades are completely detached from the brushless motor. I would expect it to last longer than two weeks. 3 stars because the power supply is still working as it should, the fan is just garbage.",
