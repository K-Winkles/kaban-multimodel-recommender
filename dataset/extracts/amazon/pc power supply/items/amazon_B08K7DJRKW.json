Sometimes while gaming, sometimes while booting up, sometimes while putting it to sleep, all sorts of stuff. I started troubleshooting and could consistently cause it to crash using Prime95 (CPU stress test software). After resetting BIOS, monitoring temps, all that jazz I was really pulling my hair out trying to figure out the problem. I remembered I had added this adapter to clean up the look. I removed it and BAM all crashing went away. Something with this adapter is causing a voltage drop or some other bad power connection. DO NOT USE WITH A PERFORMANCE GAMING RIGTLDR: Looks great, love the way it cleans up cable management but CAUSES SEVERE POWER ISSUES. DO NOT USE",

Description of A and B variant was correct, so I was able to order exactly what I needed for my RTX 4070FE. Appreciate that it\u2019s small (unlike many other 180 degree 12VHPWR adapters)! Would work especially well in a SFF build where there\u2019s little space for cable bends.The visual design is pretty subtle and I feel it would work well with most builds. Don\u2019t think it needs \u201cATX 3.0 12VHPWR 600W 16P To 16P 180\u201d written on the outside (I know what it is), but it doesn\u2019t bother me too much.As seems to be standard with most adapters of this kind, there\u2019s no clip on the GPU side. I assume this is because there wouldn\u2019t really be room for you to physically unclip it from the GPU. Not an issue for me as it\u2019s really snug in the GPU, but could be a concern for others. As is, just make sure it\u2019s fully inserted when you\u2019re done building your rig.While the adapter is working well so far, I haven\u2019t used it for very long. Will update if there\u2019s any issues.",
