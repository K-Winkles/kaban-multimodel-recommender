Which most people will end up doing anyways so not a deal breaker but more like odd for it not to include a cable that it can use. No real issues with this PSU. It was actually smaller than my 850W corsair PSU I got back in 2020. I didn't really have to upgrade to 1200W but figured with the way GPUs are going I may as well upgrade now before I'm forced to later.",

                "reviewText": "This is a solidly built power supply that comes in nice packaging. Definitely has the feel of a good product, and is worth it if you can get it for a reasonable price. It runs so quiet it's hard to tell if the 0 RPM mode actually does anything, because the noise level seems to be the same regardless of if it's on or off (maybe that's a good thing).There are a few small problems I have with it though. First of all, the main 24-pin connector is split between 18 pins on one side and 6 on the other, but the two sides don't match up with the configuration on the PSU, so it's necessary to switch the sides, which made me a little uncomfortable while plugging it in. Another issue is that while it does come with 2 SATA cables, only 1 of the cables has 4 connectors on it while the other has 2. So if you have more than 6 SATA devices you won't be able to connect them all.",

                "reviewText": "Upon opening the box you see a zippered reusable blue bag with all of the cables neatly wrapped and the PSU in a nice sleeve. It installed nicely and the cables included all clicked in without needing to force any of them. The cables are not overly stiff and flex and mold easily. I had zero issues fitting them in places or getting them to connect. In fact my cable management got slightly better with this one due to the cables flex!Worth the price and this is way quieter than my old EVGA gold.",
