                "reviewText": "I have bought this exact kit a few times now, whether it be for my own PC, a friends PC, or any other one that had a white theme.From my experience, this is the consistently cheapest kit on Amazon and they function great. The ends and clips are Black instead of white, but for every build I have done, the motherboard has been black anyways so it fits right in.The cable clips can be struggle to put on, and offer very little flexibility once installed, so make sure to space them extra wide so you can get enough bend to put the end of the extensions behind the motherboard!Overall would definitely recommend as they are a great budget option.",

                "reviewText": "Ease of Install : 9/10 (1 being impossible, 10 being it arrived and installed itself)Flexibility : 7/10(0 being overcooked noodles, 10 being barely bend-able)Ability to hold shape : 9/10(1 being they just drape , 10 being they stay completely wherever you move them)Color Accuracy : 10/10I got the yellow/black/gray set and am very satisfied with the color.Quality: 10/10These cables are the perfect balance of flexibility and firmness for what I was looking for and just simply look great!It may be important to know that these are an ADDITION to you current PCIe cables and NOT A REPLACEMENT. They do not plug into your power supply. You will attach them to the end of your current cables from power supply and then to your motherboard.ALSO when bent to a curve the inner row of cables will move and create an odd bend (see photo 1) however I just simply shifted those cables in the inner row a bit and was happy with it still (see photo 2). I really like the flexibility in design options. I even got carried away in adjustment possibilities. (See photo 3)This is my first custom set I\u2019ve purchased for my first PC build and if you are undecided still, I\u2019d 100% recommend going with this set!",

                "reviewText": "Very cheap price, cables flex nicely but are still rigid enough the cable spreaders can do their job properly and gives a nice aesthetic to the case. I have had no power issues since installing so that is promising. I wish it came included with one 6 pin instead of two 6+2 cables for my gpu. Aesthetically I made it work by cutting the cable spreaders into 3 doubles and I just hid the extra cable in the side panel. If there was just a 6pin I could have just gone straight and not bent up two wires so much. Hopefully down the line I don\u2019t need two 8 pin connectors or else one set of cable will probably look slightly deformed and I would have to buy a set of 4 cable separators since I had to modify the current ones for a cleaner look. I gave value for money 4 stars as I feel that a single six pin would have been great to include and for them to possibly just shorten the cables a few cm could help. All in all I\u2019d buy again still knowing the limitations.",

                "reviewText": "Wanted to clean up the look on my build and was looking for some time to purchase a decently priced set of extension cables. Took the chance with these and I am pleased to report that they work as intended.One piece of advise is to make sure the cables are properly connected to its corresponding PSU cable and before, while and after doing cable management, ensure that the cables are FULLY plugged as to avoid any problems while powering on the pc.They are sturdy and nice, the combs are meh, a bit hard to work with, but with patience it gets there and make sure you put it on the correct side of the cables, or you will have a cable with the combs on the other side of the arc, which is annoying.Do I recommend them, absolutely. Are they guaranteed to work, it depends, these are components for electronics, which have a failure % to consider, just ensure that the individual cable is properly attached, check the cable connections, ensure that the your 24 pin and 8 pin is fully inserted to the MB and other common practices to ensure the lowest possibility of failure and then damaged components.",
