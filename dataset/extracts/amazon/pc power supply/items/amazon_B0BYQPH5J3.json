                "reviewText": "I don't really have PSU testing tools, so I defer any serious considerations to them, but this model does have a lot of shining reviews by those who do have the tools (though of course reviews have to always be taken with a grain of salt. Or a whole shaker even these days.)What I can tell is that it has all the outward signs of a quality PSU. It's quite hefty for its size, seems to have a good fan, etc etc. When I measure things like voltage via software (not sure how reliable that is, but it's the best I have,) they seem to be more stable than my previous PSUs.One curiosity I don't really know how to explain is it has an extra relay inside doing who knows what. When you first turn things on, it's already able to handle the full power draw of the computer, so it's not like it's a low power switch for suspending or something -- it's straight to 100% before the relay even switches. I'm wondering if it switches on a capacitor after initial startup pull to handle power blinks and the like while avoiding that huge sudden instant draw you'd normally get, but this is merely a guess.All in all I'm very much liking it. It's a tiny bit more compact to also work with smaller systems, but also fits fine in my mid tower (these days I guess that's considered a full tower, lol.) The modular cables work fairly well, though I wish the parts that can be put together or pulled apart (like the CPU power connector) snapped together more firmly so you don't have to carefully hold them together while inserting. I was pleasantly surprised it even included the latest 12VHPWR type-4 connector.I guess if I had to try to choose something to complain about, I wish the power efficiency curve was a bit friendlier towards the low end. Most people aren't actually using anywhere near to 850 watts of power (a lot of people would be very shocked if they plugged their computers into a Kill-a-Watt or similar meter!) For most people normal usage and light gaming is easily going to fall into the bottom side of the curve and get somewhere in the vicinity of 75% efficiency. Ideally one would pick a PSU that more aligns with what the system actually uses (taking care to ensure sufficient current of course) but I can say I picked this one because I needed a PSU I could keep for many years to come and pretty much not even have to think about it no matter what I added to my system (within reason of course. I'm not likely to be adding any of the highest end CPUs or GPUs and especially not dual GPUs which is where one is most likely to start to actually get up to numbers closer to 850.)I think most people will never come even close to fully utilizing this PSU making it a great option for a huge variety of systems (albeit at the cost of some efficiency loss for most.) From what I can tell I think we can count on it to hold up over time. Even the fan should be decent enough to not die too easily. Especially since most of the time on systems that aren't pushing it really hard the fan runs extremely quietly at a lower RPM.",

I bought this PSU to give a bit power power headroom to a 7900xtx GPU that I have. The PSU has had no issues and does what it is supposed to do. Not particularly an \"FPS gain\" or anything, but I feel better about powering an expensive GPU than I did before.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this to upgrade a Corsair 650 RM I purchased in 2020. With that build, I also bought the Corsair individually sleeved braided cable set. To upgrade, I left all the cables in place and just swapped the PSU, connecting the existing cables to the new RM850e. Of note, the 2023 RM850e is also smaller than the RM650 I upgraded, so it fits into my compact Corsair ICUE 220T case even better.Included 12VHPWR cable for the new 12+4 pin connectors on modern GPUs is flat, and I purchased the sleeved braided version for 30 bucks to go with the rest of my cables.Using this to power an AMD 5800X3D and RTX 4070 TI Super on an MSI X570 MEG Unify motherboard with 32gb RAM. The RM650 would probably have been sufficient, but I wanted a higher wattage PSU just in case, and I'm really happy with the RM850e. Price was great too.",

On my brand new build, there is both a constant loud coil whine that never stops. I can hear it clear as day sitting at my desk. This does not go away plugging my power cable into another surge protector, straight to the wall, etc.Also, the fan will kick on when the machine is idle or barely under load. Even at the lowest speed, the fan is LOUD and rattly.This PSU is not befitting of the quality I expect from Corsair. I don't know what happened but I'm now looking at other brands.",
