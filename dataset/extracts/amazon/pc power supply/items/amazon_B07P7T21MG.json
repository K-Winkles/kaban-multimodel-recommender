With this adapter, the fan rests right on top of it, perfectly even with the rest of the cooler.The adapter also doesn't clip-lock to the motherboard - some might see this as a disadvantage, but I've been building machines for a lot of years, and I've never seen one of these connectors release on it's own.",

Motherboard side doesn't have a clip to the connector, as that would prove an inconvenience to try and remove because of 90\u00b0.Can't beat it for the price and quality.",

The pictures do not really show this except the edges. So if you do not care about aesthetics, this item is perfect for your needs. If you are trying to have a PC build that looks good, this is not the part you are looking for.The description states it can break during removal. This can be prevented by using Channellock (opening all the way and carefully pulling out). If you do not have Channellocks you need this tool anyway to use the remainder of your life around the house to fix things periodically.",
