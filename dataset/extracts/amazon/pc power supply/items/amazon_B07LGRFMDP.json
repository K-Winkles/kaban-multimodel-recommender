All the you tube videos you see show people running the pump for a bit and reaching out to the PSU to switch off the power before the pump runs dry. Considering how quickly the pump runs dry and considering how critical it is to be able to reach and toggle the power button on the PSU (to avoid harming the pump), you really need to have that control at your fingertips. This cable gives you precisely such a control. Works like a charm and this is an item I would recommend very strongly if you are into water cooling your PC.",

                "reviewText": "Exactly what I needed for a 8 drive computer case that I originally got to act as my raid file server. I have since gone a different direction, but I loved the compactness of this case and finding a low cost computer case that holds 8 drives with drive trays is very hard.Originally had it setup with a mATX motherboard just to keep the power supply ono to power the drives, but I did not like doing that. With this product, I no longer need that in there and I gutted everything but the drives and few fans. I then installed special adapters and cables that allow me to connect the drives my separate and new file server. With this switch, it allows the drives to get their power from the power supply in that case, while keeping the other computer separate. Yes they will not power off when it does, but not a big deal since its a server and is always on.The only down side is the connections to the switch are permanent, unless you are willing to destroy the shrink wrap on them and mess with cutting/soldering. I sort of hoped the wires could be disconnected from the switch via clamp connectors, but they appear to be soldered on. I wanted to try and wire it up to the actual case switch, but I later realized that is a momentary switch, and this switch is not, so it would not work anyway. But even if I wanted to say cut out a hole in the case to install this switch, without cutting the wires and redoing it, there is no way, but not really willing to cut a whole in this case for that, so I will just let the switch hang out the side when the cover is put back on.Otherwise, works perfectly!",

                "reviewText": "I was going to buy just a simple jumper, but this item came up when I added the jumper to the cart. Boy, am I glad I spent a couple more $$ for this. My PSU doesn't have a power switch, so I would have been plugging in/unplugging the main power cable a bunch of times to get the system filled and all the bubbles out. Having the simple rocker switch made life way, way easier. If, like me, you had this item come up when you put a plain jumper in your cart, d o yourself a favor and get this instead.",
