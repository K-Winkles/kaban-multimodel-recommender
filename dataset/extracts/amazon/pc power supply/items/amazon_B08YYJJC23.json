                "reviewText": "It's kind of hard to give a detailed review of a power supply. It works fine. I didn't have any issues with installation or excessive fan noise or coil whine. One thing to note is that the non modular cpu and motherboard power cables are the \"ketchup and mustard\" red and yellow color with a see through black mesh sleeve over them. If you computer case has a window or glass side panel, it might clash with the aesthetics of your set up. The modular cables are all solid black except for the end of the gpu cable that plugs into the power supply which is color coded red so you don't accidentally plug it into the wrong one.",
