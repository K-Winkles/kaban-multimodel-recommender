The cable is braided and that is very good. The length is just perfect.This is just an one time purchase since we won't need such cable again. It is a good item and good quality.",

                "reviewText": "I recently upgraded my stock PSU to a modular Corsair 650w and I needed a 24 to 14 pin cable. I ordered this one and it is working well. I deducted one star because the item that arrived did not have a cable sleeve as pictured. It is not a big deal, but if the cable supplied had the cable sleeve as pictured it definitely helps with cable management within the compact computer case. I had to use extra zip ties to secure the extended (longer) cable away from the motherboard and other hardware.",

Lenovo pcs take a proprietary power supply that cost double what a standard power supply does. Using this adapter I was able to easily install a standard power supply in the pc that worked perfectly with this adapter. My adapter did come with the wire cover on it. Hopefully others will see this and save their money buy using this adapter.",

It came with a Huntkey HK380-16FP Power Supply with a 14-pins Motherboard connector and a 4-pins CPU connector. Since I want to add a graphic card that requires power, I had to change the PSU (AresGame 500W, standard PSU). Before plugging this adapter in the motherboard, I used my multimeter to check all the pin voltages. It's a perfect match. It's with great confidence that I plugged everything and flipped the switch on. Working great so far.",
