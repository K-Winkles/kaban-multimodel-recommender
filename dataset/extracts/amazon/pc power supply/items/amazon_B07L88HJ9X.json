The PSU cable on its own was not quite long enough to route the way I wanted, and this extension does the job. The cheap case I got for her happens to have a window, and I needed something that was inexpensive yet did not look as ugly as ketchup & mustard cables. It matches the black & blue motherboard & black interior of the case without the additional cost of sleeved cables.",

Basically, the fit is poor and my voltage readings fluctuate significantly, which I believe to be the root cause for various problems I was having with the system.The female connector on this extension was very tight into the PSU connector - I am not able to wiggle it. Likewise, the male side is tight into the motherboard.Previously, I'd be able to wiggle the PSU connector on the MB and see variation in voltage measured by monitoring software or in the BIOS, but with this installed, so far, it's rock solid, and essentially has saved me from the need to replace the power supply.",
