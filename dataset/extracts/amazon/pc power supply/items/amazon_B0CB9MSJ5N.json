                "reviewText": "I really like that MSI has gotten into the power supply unit manufacturing side of computer hardware. This power supply is very compact, quiet and has enough power to run everything that I have thrown at it in my hardcore gaming build. One of the best features of MSI is that they use factory seal stickers that can only be removed once on all of their hardware so there is no chance you are receiving someone else's damaged store return when buying from online/ box stores that sometimes will not admit that they resell returned items which they sometimes do. This MSI power supply unit is exactly what I needed for my computer needs of cable modularity and for future component upgrades that may carry a need for increased overall wattage. It delivers beyond expectations on every level. One of my favorite features is the sweet looking logo imprinted onto the power supply unit that enhances the aesthetics of my build. I wanted to try to find one thing about this product that I didn't like but I honestly cant as this is a job well done. Great job MSI, my favorite go to brand!",

                "reviewText": "This is an outstanding PSU for the money. It is extremely quiet and has plenty of modular cables included and even a bag to store the ones you don\u2019t use. Comes with one PCIe5 cable, ATX connector, two CPU cables, two PCIe cables, an SATA cable, a molex cable and is ATX 3.0 ready. The ONLY reason I took off 1 star is that the 24pin ATX connector has to stretch oddly to fit into the PSU, you almost feel like your going to break the cable the way you have to twist it to fit into the PSU. The same connector is also tough to fit into the motherboard. It feels like it just doesn\u2019t make a good connection or snap in. I\u2019ve installed 3 of them, 2 connected to a ASUS motherboard and 1 used on a MSI motherboard, and it was the same feeling trying to make the connector fit. One of the computers wouldn\u2019t turn on one day and I took the connector off the motherboard and plugged it back in. It still didn\u2019t work, then I twisted the cable a little bit and the computer started up. I would buy another for $100.",
