                "reviewText": "I purchased this PSU for my wife's ITX build (white). The unit is completely modular, extremely well-built and completely silent. The white finish matches the ThermalTake ITX case I bought, and all of the cables are wrapped individually in a white mesh sleeve with the connectors in black. It looks like a Star Wars Storm Trooper (that's good in my opinion). There were more than enough cables for my ITX build and had I used an ATX case, I would have had plenty to connect all of the components.I've used Corsair products in various PC builds for years and that is for a reason. I had a unit of RAM go bad after 4 years of use and Corsair replaced all units at no cost to me even though the other 3 units had no errors. Corsair stands by their products, they are built to perform, and when the inevitable happens they are there to help you.Don't buy cheap power supplies! Research PC components and get opinions from people who actually build PCs (YouTube: Gamer's Nexus, Jayz 2 Cents, Linus Tech Tips, Hardware Canucks, etc) and see what they have to say--you'll be glad you invested the time before you buy.",

I just reached the end of the cable length capability in my install but I was also building in a full tower XL case so\u2026 that\u2019ll happen. If you\u2019re doing a large build you may need some custom longer cords if you are concerned about bending/the aesthetics of it.",

It's absolutely gorgeous and fit well with my build.When it comes to saving money, the power supply is NOT the part you want to cheap out on. Sure you can say stuff like the motherboard or the CPU is the heart of the computer, but a bad power supply can kill it all. I'm not too knowledgeable when it comes to the specifics of a PSU, but PSU Cultist is a well-known and trusted reviewer and the tier-list has been trusted by many and I can definitely support them. I've had this PSU with my build for about 2 years now and it's going strong.",

                "reviewText": "The Corsair power supply does a good job for my custom build. Its modular plug design means you only install the cables you need which greatly simplifies cable management. However, for my MSI B450M PRO-VDH MAX motherboard the Corsair 8-pin CPU cable has the wrong pin configuration. Corsair support initially denied the issue, then later confirmed that they did not and could not provide the required CPU power cable for my MOBO. So, I purchased a YEZriler CPU Power Adapter Sleeved Cable through Amazon that plugs into both the Corsair power supply and the MSI MOBO.",
