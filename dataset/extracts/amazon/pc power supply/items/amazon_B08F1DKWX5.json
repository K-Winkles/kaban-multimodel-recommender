                "reviewText": "EVGA is known for making quality products, and the EVGA SuperNova 1300 G+ is no exception! It's an exceptional performing power supply, especially for the price. I purchased this from Amazon when it was on sale for $199.99 and now currently own three of these (I bought two directly from EVGA). For what you're getting at that price, I couldn't be more pleased.Pros: - Price - Fully Modular - Sleeved Cables - 10 Year Warranty - Minimal Coil Whine - 100% Japanese Capacitors - Quiet 135mm Fan w/ ECO Mode - Excellent Performance & Voltage Regulation - Plenty of Cables for a Variety of Builds & ApplicationsCons: - 4 of the 6 PCIe Cables are Single 8-Pin (6+2) - As Stated Above, Only Includes Two Dual 8-Pin (6+2) PCIe Cables - None. My EVGA 1300w G+ PSU's Have Been Running Flawlessly Under Constant LoadI highly recommend this PSU. You simply can't go wrong with EVGA.Note: I read through some of the One-Star Reviews. My experience with this power supply doesn't at all reflect their claims (PSU exploding, catching fire, destroying PC, etc.). I can't say that any of those events didn't happen, but I'm usually a bit skeptical when a review ends with \"Don't EVER buy EVGA! Go with X brand(s) instead!\" I've personally owned close to a dozen EVGA power supplies throughout my lifetime. I've only had to RMA one after it kept powering off after 6-7 years of continuous use, which was an 850w G2 that EVGA discovered was faulty. They quickly replaced it with an 850w G3. This was about 2-3 years ago, and there have been no issues since the RMA.EVGA's Customer Service and RMA process is among the very best in the business.",

This thing has all the Cables you could need i used this on a 15 GPU RIG no of course only on 4 cards i got 1100 watts Server PSUS x 3 groups of 4 cards.. But what i like about this one 9 PCIe hook ups i was able to do 4 risers straight to PCIe not a stupid sata connector. Then the 5 Split took care of my 3090 / 3070 TI / 6700 XT / 6800 XT and 400 watts of fans even hardwired my little screen to this unit with an older perpherial cable then new cables where to nice to cut up!NOTES;This thing will work 110 volts @ 1600 watts pulling 14.545 amps Now 110 volts are on a badly or old wired house most of your houses in the US will be 120 volts that will get you 120 volts @ 1600 watts pulling 13.33 so will work on a standard 15 amp 110/120 volt outlet with THE SUPPLIED POWER CABLE its 110 pronged.Now to the 220/240 Deal this is how i run myn you need a diffrent power cord and of course a 220/240 circuit220 Volts @ 1600 watts pulling 7.27 this is once again in sub par power enviroment240 Volts this is what you should have if your electrical is on point 240 Volts @ 1600 watts pulling a measilly 6.67 perfect... This fits my 20 amp 240 outlet supply setup perfect1100 watts @ 240 x 31600 watts @ 240 x 120.46 amps totalBut i dont use it all i could and prolly be ok~~~ Any ways the story here is if you get the correct cable for about 20 bucks youll be able to run the 220/240 circuit on this guy its right here if you need one:https://www.amazon.com/NEMA-6-20P-C13-Power-Cord/dp/B004WJNVH4Any how im super pleased the noise is not an issue because you should hear the server PSU lol oh ill do a video why not! So as you can hear in video i could not tell you how loud the thing gets but its rock solid!240 - 20 amp circuit pulling about 4700 watts, So even on a 110/120 Circuit your good that is what power cable comes with the unit for 220 follow the link...By the way real good price Microcenter down the road there 500 bucks and i would have to drive down there i ordered this and had it same day 8 hours later!Happy Mining / Gaming!",

It is very well made and EVGA is a great company to deal with and they stand behind their products if you ever do have a problem. 10 Year warranty is a big plus. I was happy with the cables supplied with this unit. If you have a large case you might want to order some extensions if your looking at mounting it on top and running the wires down through the back. I have a Fractal Torrent case and this is what I had to do. I would have had to do this with any other PSU as well.",
