                "reviewText": "I've purchased several 12 VDC power supplies similar to this one for use in powering larger arrays of LED lights. Since most reasonably priced DC power adapters top out at 4 or 5 amps, powering larger LED arrays, such as a coffered ceiling, would either require multiple adapters or a larger power supply like this one. In terms of amps/$, this type of supply is definitely more cost-effective, but of course it requires a bit more care in terms of installation location and you have to accommodate the minor fan noise.I have this unit installed in a masonry outdoor kitchen, mounted up inside in an area protected from any rain water that can be blown thru small openings in cabinet doors, vents or the BBQ grill on a windy, rainy day. I'm using it to power three circuits of landscape lighting, the total power requirements being well under its 30A rating. It is working great for this so far, although it's hard to say how it will hold up in this outdoor environment where humidity levels frequently exceed what most electronics should be exposed to. However, if/when this one fails I'll purchase a replacement and probably mount it inside the house since I installed a spare conduit running from the kitchen to the basement for this purpose.For under $20, you can't beat this power supply if the switching technology will support your needs.",

I've only had it one day but I was able to pull a full 40 watts on my SM-50 repeater project at the bench. The power supply did make a small audible noose under load so I connected an oscilloscope to the output and saw some 462MHz feedback but it was less than 300 mVpp. It does have a strong \"electronics small\" but I kind of expected that because of the price -- as long as it doesn't blow up or catch fire. The only thing that scares me is the fan, I did not see it turn on during my light testing session which lasted about 10 minutes.I will update my review as I learn more.",
