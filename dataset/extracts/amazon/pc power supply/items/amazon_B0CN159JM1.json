                "reviewText": "The kit comes with one ATX power, two CPU, and one PCIe extension cable. This doesn't make a lot of sense for most uses. It should include one CPU, and two PCIe cables to make it worthwhile. I ended up buying a larger set to get the missing PCIe cable I needed.The cables themselves are an almost iridescent white with white connectors. They are much shorter than most PSU extension cables, so that makes them great for use in smaller cases.The kit comes with plenty of cable combs to get the right look.The cables are sort of pre-arched - one side of the cables are shorter than the other, so you don't end up with unruly cables. This does leave you with only one way to plug in the PCIe cables. In my case, this was the way I wanted them to go anyway, so I got lucky.I used these in a micro ATX case with an SFX power supply, and they were perfect for adding just the right amount of length to the already short cables, and adding a lovely all white look.",

                "reviewText": "I'm pretty disappointed in these cables. They look nice and are flexible, but I would almost say they are too flexible. I had two major issues with them:First, they were shipped directly from China and took over a month to get to me. Had I realized this ahead of time, I would not have ordered them, because I didn't have them in time to complete my computer build.Second, their quality control seems very questionable, so I will not be using them, for fear of damaging my computer or power supply. As you can see in the picture, the individually braided wires are cut at random lengths, making for a very bad look. It would take a bit of creative positioning to get this 24-pin cable to look good in my case.I'm very disappointed, and I cannot recommend these cables.",
