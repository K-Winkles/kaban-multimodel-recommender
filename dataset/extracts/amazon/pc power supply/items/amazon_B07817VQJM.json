The \"80/90+% efficiency\" they mark is only at that halfway point with efficiency slipping away in ether direction from there.",

Connects all the stuff I need, long enough for full tower cases and matches all the modern connectors like PCI-E while keeping the power connector for older plugs and HDD's. Overall good product with good value.TL:DRGood quality, long lasting and great value.",
