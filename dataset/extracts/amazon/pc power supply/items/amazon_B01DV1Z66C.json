Great build quality and individually threaded cables make this cable look very clean and almost one with the case. someone better at cable management than I could likely make it look even better, however I am by no means unsatisfied with my work :) definitely a necessity in my mind if youre building a pc that will be visible internally.",

It's kinda annoyed me tho since the power supply wasn't budget and it was from a good brand, was looking around for sleeved cables and really didn't need a full set and I found this solo for $9 which saved me $20 and so I got it.It works well for what it is, no comb included but it works and I have 0 complaint, sleeving feels nice and the cable extension looks to be of decent quality, pretty impressed for the price I may look at other options if I ever decided to go for anything other than a black color scheme.",

                "reviewText": "Sorry its a little hard to see in the pictures, but THATS THE POINT!! Haha. The power cable that came with the power supply was all different colors, and didnt match the theme of the computer at all. This extension looks much better, or since you dont see it, doesnt look like anything at all! Haha. It serves its purpose perfectly.I would recommend buying a set of cheap plastic wire combs to keep these looking their best. It would have been nice if they included a cheap set, but its not a deal breaker. Still a good value!",

                "reviewText": "I've been trying to install a new radiator so I can get my PC on water, but the original 24 pin cable was so bulky thick and messy that it was preventing the radiator from fitting properly.I wasn't too happy with the idea of adding 12 more inches of cable to my ITX enclosure, but something needed to be done about the stock cable. With the extension, I was able to get a nice tight flat bend, and now the cable has a nice gap between the radiator.My only other Alternative was to pay a pretty high premium price to have custom shorter 24 pin cable made, needless to say I decided to try the value rout first and I'm glad I did.The cable is pretty well made and holds it's bend pretty easily. It's a little stiffer near the connections but it's pretty easy to flex in the center, this allowed me to rout most of the cable down along the side of the enclosure.So now I can get back to happy water cooling.Using a thermaltake core v1, with alphacool nexXxos 140, and corsair ML 140 fan.",

It allowed me to run the 24 pin PSU cable behind the motherboard tray to keep wires out of view in the case. Because the wires are easily bent, when I install it on the motherboard, it doesn't put/pull pressure on the 24 pin connector. Gives me more piece of mind and protects the motherboard connector that way.I would use this again.",
