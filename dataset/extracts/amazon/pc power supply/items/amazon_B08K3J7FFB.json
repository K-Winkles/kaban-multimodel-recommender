                "reviewText": "I purchased this for a Windows 10/64 desktop system in the recording studio. The power on/off button works perfectly every time. The USB hub works, but only sometimes for me, and not consistently. I know some devices don't like to run through certain types of hubs, and this might be one of those. This is on a 12th-generation Intel i7 CPU on an ASUS Z690 mobo. The audio connectors do work, but we rarely use them, so I can't say how \"good\" they are. The only thing I really dislike is the adhesive mounting. I would much rather see a couple of screw holes as an option for mounting (I realize for some that the adhesive is just fine). The construction feels fairly sound, but it is almost entirely of plastic.",

So the ribbon cable to the internal USB pin header is useless. So just put a piece of tape over the front and cover the USB ports and audio jacks. It's also good to add a 120 ohm resistor in series with the computer's power LED if you want both the box LED and the case LED to work.",

                "reviewText": "For me the main purpose of this device was to put the power button somewhere I could easily access, and it does that flawlessly. The power LED and reset buttons are a bonus. If you also want to keep using your old switches & LED, you will need to add Y-splitters for 0.1\" pitch rectangular headers. These are easy to buy, or make, but are not included in the package.The DE-15 connector that joins the external cable to the included slot cover is an absolute godsend, and in my opinion is what makes this better than all the similar (non-wireless) products I looked at before I bought this: Every other similar switch I've seen leaves you with thin, breakable wire just hanging out the back of the chassis, just begging for trouble. With this, you can simply unplug the remote switch like any other peripheral if you need to move your computer. Note: If you don't have any available full-height slots, the connector may instead be mounted in a D-sub cut-out for a serial port or VGA connector, which most chassis offer one or two of.As other reviews have mentioned, the USB features aren't great: The audio is quite cheap, and the USB ports appear to be wired to USB1.1 standard (i.e. suitable for stable 12Mbps data), which is fine for older or low-bandwith devices. If you need high-performance USB extension: This isn't it, buy a USB-3 hub or extension cord to go with it. Personally I've left the audio device un-plugged, and don't use the two USB ports much.",

                "reviewText": "I just installed it on the underside of my desk. I'm only using it to turn on and reset my PC. Works fine on the the first try. The build quality is good and the adhesive will hold the item to the bottom side of a surface. The cables are easy to route in tighter spots and the texture of the casing helps things stay in place.I have it setup on the bottom side of my desk to turn on and reset my PC. The button feels firm and there is no give to the casing when the button is depressed. There is a clear click sound when depressed so you know when things are happening. The amount of pressure needed to press the button is perfect to avoid accidently turning my PC off.I chose this item because I like the reset button feature, the adhesive on the base and the length of cables. For my intended use (power/reset) it works better than I anticipated. I feel a bit like a mad super villain sending some one to the dungeon when I turn my PC on... My girlfriend jokes that it is my 'old man button'. However it is said, the item works and I am a happy customer.",

                "reviewTitle": "Well made and smartly designed external power/reset switch.",
                "reviewText": "Button is nice and tactile and behaves like a proper PC power button. In other words, it has a springy feeling when clicked once and powers on the PC. Button does not feel cheap andit also lights up blue. The housing has good weight to it (I actually didn't need to mount with adhesive even though it comes with it). When logged into Windows, the same click of the button gracefully shuts down the PC and the OS recognizes the input. If you hold the button down for 4-seconds, it hard powers off the PC. Having the smaller Reset button on the side is super handy as well. The USB and connector cables are high quality and don't feel flimsy. I have an open air mining rig, so I like the fact I can install the metal bracket anywhere onto the framework and the modular design allows me to plug in the switch to the port on the bracket from there. Very functional and versatile!",
