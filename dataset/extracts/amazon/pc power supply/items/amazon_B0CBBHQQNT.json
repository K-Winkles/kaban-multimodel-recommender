Looks so much better than stock cables. the cables are stiff which is good, it lets you bend as needed and as you can see the 24 pin cable I ran from the back did not take much effort to look like that. they cables stay in place, I have had these installed for about a couple weeks now, they look exactly the same. will not droop, sag, lose shape. The pictures speak for themselves. Please note, these cables do not plug directly into your PSU. These are extension cables, you simply unplug from your motherboard and plug the end into the Antec cable, plug the other end of Antec cable to your mother board. it takes a few minutes to install. it takes more time to cable manage after you get the cables the way you want. I only used the 24 pin motherboard cable, and two 4 pin for the GPU. Well worth the price for your PC to look like this.",

                "reviewText": "Full disclosure, I'm 45, haven't built a computer in 30 years, and my review is a sample size of one.TLDR, I like them and the look legit which is the goal. I'd buy them again.BUT, I get the concerns in other reviews b/c the thickness reduces flexibility. It's a balance between form and function.As some stated, these are quite thick. That is good thing....I think. They look awesome IMO and I had no QC issues with the wires, they were all in top notch condition.The thickness means being super diligent about prepping and routing them. They will benefit from being pre-bent and flexed around so they can be routed and installed as easy as possible. It isn't without headaches though for the same reasons, they're thick and more difficult to bend.24 pin connector - mucho wires on this sleeve and limited real estate to curve them into the back of the case means, once plugged in, there is pressure put onto it motherboard connector. Tight fit in the case (NZXT H510 Elite) so its a short space for the wires to curve into which creates pressure on things. It worries me even though they look great and are operating as designed (day 4 after build).CPU power - same problem, limited real estate means a tight corner which means pressure can flex against case or motherboard once connected.GPU - again, same thing. thickness of wires creates tension which made it tedious to get just right. the aesthetics were being impacted once i started to cable manage, in large part bc of the stiffness of the cables.",

                "reviewText": "Really happy with these cable extensions. They\u2019re a great value and very well built. I did notice one of my 24 pin cables was loose in the plug but I was able to push it back to it\u2019s locked position.Do be warned however that, since these are 16 gauge and sleeved, the cables are fairly stiff and hard to train around bends. Plus, since all the individual cables in any of the extensions are the same length, the cables on the inside of the bend will be too long to keep the rest of the extension straight. You\u2019ll need to find a way to take up the excess length. I did this on the back side of the motherboard tray by bowing the excess cables out of alignment. Note the distorted cables in the picture. The 24 pin is by far the hardest to train properly but take your time and use the extra combs to train the excess cables length to lay flat behind the motherboard. Also, since I built in a smallish case, there was a lot of extra cable length I needed to stash in the case basement.The final results looks great!",

The only reason I don't give 5 stars is mine weren't included with cable combs which is why I bought these ones specifically. I still think they are worth the price.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these to make my first ever computer build look more neat and organized. Upon arrival, they looked nice and I was excited to install them, but that\u2019s where the positive review stops.I used a high quality EVGA PSU and it took almost 2 hours of twisting, bending, pressing, and adjusting pins with tweezers to even get the connectors snapped in place. I had bloody knuckles and fingers in 3 spots and I could feel the anger and stress built up inside of me.Upon first fire up of my new build, it didn\u2019t even work! The GPU cables weren\u2019t giving the GPU power. I removed them and saw that a few of the wires had came out of the connectors. So\u2026 I ordered a second set and tried again. SAME RESULT! the connectors wouldn\u2019t attach for anything and some of the pins came out again. At least I was able to return this set since I kept the packaging. I purchased 2 sets and couldn\u2019t even get enough good pieces for 1 PC build.After building my new PC I wanted to upgrade my old one a bit before handed it down to my girlfriend. One of the things I bought for it was the AsiaHorse PSU cable extension kit. What a difference! These cables were so soft and flexible (the Antec\u2019s are very very stiff) and they literally pressed in place instantaneously. The build quality and poor connectors on the Antec cables definitely isn\u2019t normal and I\u2019d avoid them at all costs. Look at AsiaHorse cables here on Amazon if you\u2019d like to save yourself a headache and even a little bit of money because they\u2019re cheaper too!",
