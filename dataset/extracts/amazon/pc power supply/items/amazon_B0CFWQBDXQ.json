                "reviewText": "Nice looking unit. Very quiet (although I haven't quite figured out what the fan noise control switch does). Totally modular (which I didn't think was that big a deal, until I installed it). My old power supply just had a big wad of cables coming out of it, with maybe six drive power connectors on each one, plus a separate cable for fan power, and one for a higher-end video card than I have. There were unused cables flopping around everywhere, and they were in tubular sleeves, which made them very hard to bend or route. The Thermaltake unit has connectors on the power supply where you plug in only the power cables you want to use. It comes with a full set of cables for ATX motherboard power, IDE and SATA drive power, separate CPU power, and so on. They're made with the conductors in parallel, resulting in flat cables that are easy to route, bend, fold, and tuck out of the way. My old power supply sounded like someone was running a vacuum cleaner in the next room; this one is much, MUCH quieter. I was fairly impressed that the manufacturer had included a nice nylon-like pouch with a Velcro closure with all the cables in it. It was nice to have a place to neatly store the unused cables. I've seen some bad things about reliability in other reviews; so far, it works great, and I'm happy to have my system functioning again. If anything should subsequently happen in terms of reliability, I'll update my review.",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Great Value Power Supply",
                "reviewText": "So far this power supply has been fantastic. I have previously bought other Thermaltake items, but had never really heard anything about their power supplies. I was looking for a fully modular supply to replace my EVGA 500W because I did not have enough room behind my motherboard tray to install an SSD with all the extra cables from the non-modular EVGA unit and the cable extensions I had on some of the leads. The cables of this unit occupy a relatively tiny amount of room compared to a non-modular unit. I was able to relocate a 3.5 inch hard drive to the back of my case (Fractal Design Nano S) and install the SSD in the front compartment. I was also surprised by the quality of the cloth bag that comes with the power supply to hold any extra cables.The RGB is a nice addition considering the price and all of the other features included, but it isn't the best implementation. The fan LEDs can either slowly cycle through all of its possible colors, display solid red, display solid green, display solid blue, display solid white (which isn't a very pure white, it has a bluish tint to it), or be off. It most definitely cannot display more than one color at once as the product image would suggest. Perhaps in a future version of this power supply a better implementation of the RGB lighting would be to have a long press of the button change between the modes and preset colors (what the short press does now) and allow a short press to pause the color cycle in the mode that slowly changes between all the colors. That way it would be possible for the user to have a wider array of static colors if they do not like any of the presets.As for noise, the power supply is not audible over the other case fans and my CPU cooler. I appreciate the inclusion of the smart-zero fan switch, but I always leave the fan on considering it does not add any noticeable noise and it allows me to use the supply as a secondary exhaust fan for my system.So far the only drawback to this power supply aside from the aforementioned lack of full RGB customization is the red connectors for the PCI power cables and the sheer amount of colors on the stickers on both sides. For a product that claims to have implemented RGB as a way to let the user customize their color scheme, using these colors over black and white just doesn't make sense.Overall, this is a great power supply, especially for the asking price. If you are looking for a power supply that will add that extra little bit of flair to your PC, look no further, this is it.",

                "reviewText": "Honestly, I was not expecting to be wow'd by this power supply. It has RGB...so? No one is going to see it. It'll likely be loud. For $99 how good can this be. I'm used to spending from $100-$200 for a PSU. I've learned the hard way not to go super cheap on these. I've had about 6 different brands over many years of building computers. I bought this one for someone else and thought, \"I don't want to go super cheap...this needs to last. I'll get something on the bottom end of my budget that still should work well enough.I read the reviews on Amazon and then looked at reviews elsewhere. I still wasn't entirely convinced.So, here's what I ended up learning after getting this thing. It's quiet....I mean VERY quiet. The RGB is OK, but again no one is really going to see it, so it's a bit of a dumb design for RGB. They should have put some kind of vents or logo or stripes or something that show the lighting. You're either going to have this thing pointed up or down in most cases (pun intended). That means you won't see the lighting in the majority of chassis. The PSU has pretty stable rails. For the $99 I paid, I realized I kind of want one of these for myself, for the quiet nature of the thing. The most loud items in my own case are the CPU cooler and the PSU.On top of that, this thing is really well built. It feels good in the hands. It's solid, weighty, smooth and has sharp lettering. The cables that come with it are not braided, but they bend VERY easily, so using this in a build where cable management can be an issue is a good thing. I have an Enthoo Evolv X, so cable management is never an issue. I would highly recommend this PSU. I've been doing this a VERY long time. I haven't come across a PSU that wow'd me in a while. A non-RGB variant of this (assuming it doesn't exist) would make this cheaper/better.",

                "reviewText": "I rely on my PC for everything. Surfing, gaming, VR, Virtual Pinball, etc. One morning, I turned on my PC and nothing happened, no power. This is a scary feeling!!! So the first thing I did was swap the battery on my motherboard hoping this may be a quick fix. No dice. I was fairly certain that my old 800 watt power supply failed so I searched for a replacement. I'm really pleased that I stumbled onto this particular unit - they were selling a similar one at Best Buy for the same price, but it only had Bronze certification, not Gold. So I purchased this unit, swapped the power supplies, held my breath, powered on, and thank god -- it worked!! This power supply is so much better than my older one -- LOVE the RGB colours and the modular design. I only installed the wiring that I needed rather than having to tie off / bind loose cables like I did with my older power supply. If you need a PC power supply, don't look any further, this is an amazing power supply. Very high quality, 10 year warranty, and highly recommended!!",
