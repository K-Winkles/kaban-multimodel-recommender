I forgot to measure the length but for me they were plenty long enough. I have an archaic system with 2 SATA drives and a DVD burner so there were a lot of cables left over that zip tied and tucked away in a cubby hole above the drives. I was getting BSOD with so many different errors I knew it was hardware and decided to start with the power situation first. So far so good. This thing is either real quiet or my other one was loud but I can not hear anything at all down there. I think I am going to order another one to park on a shelf just because. Now to look into surge protectors since mine obviously is not doing it's job anymore.",

As soon as I swapped this one, everything changed. My whole build is really focused on being quiet, and the last thing that was still super noisy was my old power supply. This guy is completely silent and literally runs ice cold. I'm so impressed I've recommended it to my brother as well since he was looking for an upgrade. And the price is really really good too for a Gold rated power supply. This is my new main power supply recommendation.",

I used it in a mini-ITX Ryzen 7 5700g build and it is really a bit of overkill. But it was available and not at a a premium price.Nor five stars because the price for a PSU like this to get five it would also have to be cheaper.",

(only time I could say the magic smoke escaped from a system I owned)Needless to say, I was done with EVGA not saying they are a bad company or other products may not work great but I did not have much luck with their PSU what luck I did have seemed to be bad. My gigabyte PSU has been running problem-free for about 6 months and would recommend it to anyone building a new system or who needs to replace a failed PSU.",

                "reviewText": "I picked this power supply up with high hopes for me first ever computer build. Let me tell you, this experience was anything but enjoyable. This had nothing to do with product defects, but everything to do with how the manufacturer made this product.This is a fully modular PSU, but I had a MAJOR issue with it. To start, the PCIe cables that are included in this package are either daisy chained (1 cable into the PSU, 2 PCIe out) or an 8-pin that is 2x 4-pin connectors slid together. For my GPU(I have the 3080 Ti which has 3x PCIe ports), the PCIe cables that were not daisy chained would not even fit into the power ports due to the fact that they were 2x 4-pin connectors put together. The daisy chained ones fit just fine, but they're not recommended for GPU use by users, the manufacturer, and cause a decrease in performance. Even with that in mind, it wouldn't be a good idea to leave an odd one out because it would be an extra risk.After all this I still had some hope, but that didn't last long. I decided that I would just purchase new PCIe connectors since this is a fully-modular design. I was wrong. Gigabyte doesn't sell any replacement cords and there were no 3rd party sellers that have them either. I just couldn't believe it when I saw this for a fully modular PSU.If you're not going to be building a newish gaming computer or are building a system without a GPU (not sure why you would be getting an 850W PSU then), then this would work out fine. On the other hand, if you are DO NOT BUY THIS. It'll save you alot of time and keep your blood pressure where it needs to be at!",

I normally buy Seasonic or EVGA but I thought for the price I would give this a try. Gigabyte make great motherboards. My FreeNAS is my 3rd backup solution so it is not mission critical but has a music library for my music streamer. The PSU is bronze certified and the cables are all black; no mustard cables. For a simple solution this fits the bill. Definitely buy again.",
