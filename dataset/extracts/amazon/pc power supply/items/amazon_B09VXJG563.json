                "reviewText": "Overall Rating: 4 out of 5 starsFor: Budget-conscious builders seeking efficiency, quiet operation, and modular cablesAgainst: Limited brand reputation, higher noise levels under heavy load, potentially tight cable managementPerformance: 4.5 out of 5 starsThe Redragon PSU007 packs a potent punch for its price. Its 850W output makes it suitable for even demanding gaming and workstation builds. The 80+ Gold certification ensures high efficiency, translating to lower power bills and less heat generation. In everyday use, it runs whisper-quiet, remaining near-silent under moderate loads. However, push it hard with a hefty power draw, and the fan noise can become noticeable, though still within acceptable limits.Features: 4 out of 5 starsThis PSU ticks all the essential boxes. It's fully modular, allowing you to use only the cables you need, improving airflow and aesthetics inside your case. Japanese capacitors and various circuit protections promise long-term reliability and component safety. It also boasts RGB lighting, though its implementation might be considered basic compared to flashier alternatives.Value: 5 out of 5 starsThis is where the PSU007 truly shines. Compared to established brands offering similar specs, the Redragon undercuts the price significantly. For budget-conscious builders seeking a reliable and efficient power supply, it's a hard bargain to beat.Things to Consider:Brand Reputation: Redragon is a relatively new name in the PSU market, so some users might prefer sticking with established brands for peace of mind.Noise Levels: While quiet under moderate loads, the fan noise becomes noticeable under heavy workloads, which might be a concern for noise-sensitive users.Cable Management: The modular cables are handy, but the included ones might be slightly short for spacious cases, potentially requiring extra care during installation.Final Verdict:The Redragon PSU007 850W Gold is a compelling option for budget-minded builders seeking a reliable and efficient power supply. Its quiet operation, modular cables, and 80+ Gold certification offer fantastic value for the price. While the limited brand reputation, potential increase in noise under heavy loads, and potentially short cables are minor drawbacks, they don't overshadow the overall strong performance and affordability. If you're on a tight budget and prioritize performance over brand recognition, the Redragon PSU007 is a Goldilocks-worthy choice, providing just the right power at a budget-friendly price, with just a few thorns to watch out for during installation and heavy workloads.Note:This review is based on my research and analysis of the Redragon PSU007 850W Gold. Your experience may vary depending on your specific components, case size, and usage patterns.Feel free to adapt and personalize this review to your own experience and preferences.

                "reviewText": "I had problems in the beginning where I would press the power button and just hear the PSU click then shortly after the RAM would light up. However, that was due to my own fault. I tried to take a shortcut and just reconnect the SATA PSU cable from the old unit to the new instead of using this PSU dedicated cable. After correcting that everything worked properly. I do have two complaints. 1) I wish the Smart Fan switch was reversed. Instead of it being pressed in to disable Smart Fan I would rather it be to enable the feature. 2) I had hoped the cables such as the motherboard cable would be wrapped in nylon or all the wires molded together. That way you don't have four groups of cabling between the two connectors. I learned to cope with it though. It's a solid unit for the money. It's also smaller than my previous EVGA 1200w PSU and slid right in place. I'm very happy with it especially after having back to back EVGA PSUs fry on me within six months of each other. The white cabling matches my O11 Dynamic case perfectly and we will see how things go on down the road.",

Everything works as expected.PSU has nice RGB color lighting on the fan but you cannot connect it to the motherboard for full synchronization to all RGB lighting. Otherwise its a great supply, price was right, mounts to my Huahuang frame tightly.Lose the case. Let your hardware be free.",

This one has been flawless since buying it and has an awesome RBG light too.. was worried about trusting the brand but it is great. I steer away from TUF gaming now.
