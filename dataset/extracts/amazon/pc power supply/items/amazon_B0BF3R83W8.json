                "reviewText": "I recently upgraded to the Gf1 Series Power Supply, and I'm thoroughly impressed with its performance and features. This power supply is not only 80 Plus Gold certified but is also Intel C6/C7 States ready, delivering up to 90% efficiency. It's optimized to work seamlessly with all generations of Intel's processors, ensuring maximum energy savings.One of the standout features is the ultra-quiet 140mm hydraulic bearing fan. This self-lubricated PWM fan not only provides superior cooling performance but also operates almost silently. The Smart Zero Fan technology is a game-changer, auto-regulating the fan speed based on power consumption. The fan kicks in only when the PSU workload surpasses 30%, and there's even a switch at the back to turn off the fan for constant spinning if needed.The build quality of this power supply is exceptional, with 16AWG wires ensuring durability and reliability, especially for high-end enthusiasts' PCs. The use of Japanese capacitors at 105\u00b0C offers the highest stability, durability, and reliability, enhancing the overall lifespan of the power supply.The Zero Cable Platform design, where daughterboards are directly soldered to the motherboard, contributes to better heat dissipation and impressive output power quality. The low ripple noise, less than 30 mV, ensures excellent performance and reliability for critical components like high-end graphics cards.Strict voltage regulation (<2%) for major rails is a significant advantage, surpassing Intel's standard of 5%, guaranteeing the highest performance. The high amperage single plus 12V rail ensures a stable and reliable power supply to all PC components.Safety is a top priority with industrial protections, including Under Voltage Protection (UVP), Over Voltage Protection (OVP), Short Circuit Protection (SCP), Over Power Protection (OPP), Over Temperature Protection (OTP), and Over Current Protection (OCP). This comprehensive protection ensures the safety and longevity of the power supply and connected components.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased this product on Cyber Monday and received it the following Sunday. Components were well packaged and easily identifiable. They sent every wire I needed plus additional wires I did not require (due to my PC specs). For those extra wires, they also included a small storage bag to keep the wires together incase I choose to modify my existing setup.The quality of the unit and the wires were right on par for what I felt should be included at this price point. I'm sure there are better looking and potentially better quality wires out there but from what I can tell the quality is great and looks have nothing to do with how things function so I didn't care that they were basic black wires.One complaint I had was the instructions were not super user friendly for an average Joe like me. I'm sure people who are around these components/wires all the time would have no issues with the install. I simply wanted to make sure all the wires were hooked up properly before plugging anything in and I couldn't say with 100% accuracy that I had it correct based off the instructions. However, one quick web search produced a 3 minute video that confirmed I had the install correct - this very easily could be user error.When I turned on the PC for the first time post PSU swap, I was pleased to find that the noise was much quieter than my last power supply. I was not specifically looking for a quiet unit but was happy to find that out.All in all, I think for the price, this was a great buy. I've only been using it the last 3 days but super pleased with the purchase thus far!",

                "reviewText": "I see several detailed reviews here so I'm going to keep this one quick and straight to my experience.I recently upgraded my computer and ended replacing every part except the drives and the power supply (an almost 6-year old EVGA G3 650W); everything worked fine but while gaming my new RX 7800 XT produced an annoying coil whine which tempted me to return it, however I decided to give a try first and upgraded the power supply to this Thermaltake Toughpower GF3 750W, with it the coil whine magically went away!As other reviews point out, this power supply is very silent and the cables are long although a bit stiff for my personal preference, however they are usable. By the way, this 750W power supply comes with a PCIE Gen5 cable rated at 300W.",

I didnt do much research other than get modular and get 850W. I was surprised how clean my install is with modular (i guess all modular ps are like this). Only install power cables that you need. The rest are bagged away. Anyway This is a novelty that really isnt part of this review since almost all psu's are modular now.What amazed me though is how QUIET this is. I dont really hear it at all in a silence room. It's amazing how silence changes life quality :) The thing that i can hear more is gpu or cpu fan when things heat up. But normal computer surfing, its dead silent.Great product.",
