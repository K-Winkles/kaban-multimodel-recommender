I made the mistake of trying to put them on after I installed the cables, and then \"rode the struggle bus\" trying to put the combs on without disturbing the routing of the cables. From this experience, I highly recommend putting the combs on before routing and connecting, then slowly and carefully sliding the combs to their desired final positions after installation.The final result looks really clean and I like the way it turned out.",

The only downside to this purchase is that I had to sheer off some sharp burrs on the cable combs. It was very easy to install, incredibly great build quality. To anyone worried about using extenders: they are individually sleeved cables. Nothing more than making the existing connections \"longer\", so it's completely safe. Always inspect your product to make sure the connectors are firm and won't be pushed back. A pushed back connector could \"arc\" from where it needs to mount, but I don't seeing that being a problem with these extenders at all. I LOVED this purchase.",

                "reviewText": "These Antec White cables are a decent buy, especially considering the price. I initially wanted a more 'premium' brand of extension cables, perhaps a combination of white and a highlight color, or even solid white, but I went the budget route because I'm not 100% set on a color scheme for the inside of my case. These Antec extensions come with a complete set, they are plenty long and include a lot of cable combs.I have a few, mostly cosmetic, complaints that would be less acceptable if I had paid 30-40 dollars for these.1. The cables should be slightly stiffer so they stay together better when bent and shaped.2. The coating on them is more matte than glossy, I would've preferred RGB light to 'pop' on them.3. I wish the combs were transparent, as to be less noticeable.All in all, 4/5. Would buy again, for the price.",
