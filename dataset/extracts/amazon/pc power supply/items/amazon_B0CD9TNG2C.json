It is completely inaudible, even with my RX 6800 overclocked pulling over 300 watts running furmark, and 5800x3d pulling 100 watts at the same time.And there is zero coil whine!Also comes with a heavier 16 gauge power cord instead of the standard 18, so that\u2019s a real plus and nice to see.Overall, I\u2019m extremely satisfied with this psu. Only con is the 3 year warranty, but I trust EVGA to build a good power supply, and I\u2019m sure this one will last for years.Definitely recommend.",

One star for each year they offer a warranty. 3 years for a PSU is garbage but because it's ATX 3.0, I'm giving it a shot. You can't find a 12VHPWR PSU for that cheap anywhere, so we'll see how it pans out.It's sad to see EVGA in the state it's in. I've been a fanboy for YEARS and now with no GPU game and slacking on everything else, I hope they make it but it's doubtful.Also want to mention that the PSU cables used to come in a little pouch with Velcro and now (this unit) just came with them in a plastic bag. I dunno, down hill spiral tbh.",
