                "reviewText": "This is actually a very good power supply tester unit. The key to getting the most out of it depends on a users understanding of it, which I will be explaining in this review.Find a place where you can set it up to hook up your connectors both the 20/24 pin and the 8 pin connector and leave it there still, while you turn your PSU's on and off switch. I mention this because holding it or moving around the power supply tester will give you incorrect readings.Next, something else that I haven't seen mentioned in the reviews is you turn off your PSU and then hook up your next connector, whether it be the SATA, Molex, 4-6-8 pin connectors, etc. The connectors weren't meant to be \"hot-swapped\" so always turn your power supply tester off before going to your next plug.The PG rating means \"power good\" and it needs to be between 100 ms to 500 ms. If you are getting a 0 ms, that particular plug is dead and you can't use it anymore.The LL value means the voltage is too low and HH means the value is too high. You'll also get a buzzing sound with either a PG - 0 ms, LL, HH rating, so pay attention. This indicates the voltage is out of tolerance for a peripheral and you aren't getting any power at all, aren't getting enough voltage or are getting too much and could be frying your equipment, respectively.The tolerance range is ideally +/-5% (+/-10% for the -12v rail) of what the voltage is supposed to be giving, but here are the max ranges I've found, so if your number isn't in this range you now know what to do with your PSU.+12v - 12.5v+5v - 5.3v+3.3v - 3.5v-12v - 13.2vYou can indeed test this unit under a load, but you have to take a paper clip and you'll need to connect it to your main 20/24 pin connector. Connect as many peripherals as you can and look for the PWR_ON green wire on the 20/24 pin connector and connect one end of a paper clip here and the other to a black ground wire. This starts the PSU with everything running.That's it, folks, a review that clearly explains how to use this tester.Have a good day.",

I was putting together a good retro pc. Some of the parts are expensive. With a total cost around $2K, I didn't want to risk throwing in a bad PSU and frying it. This tester showed everything with newer PSU as good. The OLD PSU, showed all the voltages, but had an \"error\" and the voltages fluctuated slightly. The newer PSU was rock solid. Threw the newer PSU into it and powered right up. Yippie. Saved me from buying another PSU.",

If you don't have them all plugged in you get a 12 v error and you might think you have a bad power supply. It is also cheaply made and has poor directions. It isn't just plug in your main cable and check it out. No on off switch, you have to have your power supply off to connect it.",
