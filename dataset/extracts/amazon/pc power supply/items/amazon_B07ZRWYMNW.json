The bag to store the cables in is nice, but mine ripped so be careful. The unit itself looks nice and feels solid. The cables connect securely and in general it's a very well made and easy to use PSU. The cables seem solid and nicely made, the black covers look nice and they are pretty flexible. The only one that is a bit stiff is the 24 pin one, but it's also very thick so not really surprising. I found them all to be long enough to wire things up easily, but not too long. Overall, I'm very happy. It's well made, it's fully modular, the cables are solid, and the price is very competitive.",

This type of use case is similar to product testing. There are a lot of both hard and soft resets, as well as drastic changes in load. I love the fully modular option for this PSU. There are plenty of cables, including sperate CPU and PCI-e cables.I purchased a second 700w not long ago to run more of my miners. I was so pleased with the product I also purchased a 850w for my own personal workstation. Good buy.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for: XPG Core Reactor Modular PSU: 80 Plus Gold - ATX - Fully Modular Power Supply - 10 Year Warranty - 650 Watt.Overall: Quiet. Stable power. Tom's Hardware recommended. Due to the CPU line's length, would probably recommend another power supply if you want/need to route through a backplane. Otherwise won't be an issue.Review:A Tom's Hardware PSU review had this listed as a recommendation, so I bought it. Technically it was my second choice but seems to be good quality.My previous power supply was quite loud with a 30% load, but this one is very quiet.I do wish the CPU power cable was longer though. The non modular cables are also pretty stiff. I ended up having to route the CPU cable over the mother board instead using the backplane.My system hasn't had any stability issues. I mention this because the PSU is one component to not skimp on. Even decent brands can have problems with power dips, consistency on the various rails, or ripple.If I had to go back, I would probably choose another power supply with a longer CPU line. However, if you don't need to route cables on a backplane, it won't be an issue for you.",

                "reviewText": "Have not had it long enough or have any of those fancy tool-o-matic-measure-thingys to do a proper review, but the pro reviews were very positive and it is powering my PC right now with little to no noise...or fire. It is slightly smaller (depth) than my old \"Antec TP750 New\" that it replaced. That Antec was still working after ~14 years, even the fan! If this one lasts that long, well, no one will care if I come edit this review to update, and I'll probably be more worried about when they're going to change my diaper anyway.One complaint is that one of the 6+2 split cables was no good. The \"+2\" split part was way too short and would never reach if plugged into an 8 lead connection (see pic). I didn't need that particular cable, so not too big of a deal.Edit: 8 months and still good. Silent, no coil wine, fan noise, or other random issues.I did see string of \"scary\" reviews starting in August 2023 after I got mine (June) though. Maybe a \"bad batch\" or changes in components from the factory occurred? These electronics manufacturers are notorious for releasing a good product, getting good reviews, then switching to cheaper/crappy internal components to save a buck, sometimes completely different to the point it should be given a new model name.",

However, I finally got all my other parts for my build, and the power supply was not operational. The unit would not turn or make any noise of any kind. The wires are in good condition, and noise came from the unit, which suggested something was loose inside the PSU. I tried multiple outlets with the same outcome. I will be requesting a replacement and hopefully receive a functioning item. I've YouTubed this power supply unit, and it's nothing but high praise. Giving this manufacturer another chance is a must. It could have been damaged in some way throughout the shipping and handling of the product. Fingers crossed.",

I didnt find them too short or long. Just right for the 4000D airflow case. And you get 4 PCIE cables instead of 2 on the 850x which killed it for me. Nice 16awg cables too for the mains. Wont have any issue filling the Nvidia 12VHPWR adapter connectors without falling short. Dont know why other PSU manufacturers cheap out on cables. So far so good XPG.
