                "reviewText": "I came across this power supply on Amazon since my local computer part store was completely out of 800 W power supplies. After reading the reviews for this power supply and other ones they offer, I decided to give it chance and the rest is history! To give context...I was using a 10 year old 800 W power supply for my rig and that thing was LOUD. I almost want to compare it to a jet engine because of how loud it would run. However for this power supply, it's easily cut down the fan noise by 85% - 90% and I can actually sleep at night now if I leave it on to download games! Haha.In regards to performance, it holds up extremely well when I play graphic demanding games on my rig. I've been playing a lot of Battlefront 2 lately on max settings as well as Division 2. I have had zero issues while gaming period. No crashing, choppiness, or hiccups. Although I first was unsure about the build quality or material, it has held up perfectly!Finally, I love the color!!! It fits perfect for the case on my gaming rig. All in all I'm very impressed! Definitely would consider purchasing another power supply from this brand again. :)",

Extra cables could be just a bit longer.Pic shows active pc. Don't have any of the unit itself. It's tucked away pretty good.I'll give it another week as it's only been running for a couple of days.Pros:- Clean cut, sharp looking- Stable power, extra cables are of quality build- Quiet so farCons:- Spare blue CPU port is not addressed in manual and no cable provided. I could have used that cable to supply the additional 4 pin header that is currently blank. Not a huge con, but it's apparent.",

You decide if this is good customer service:info@gamemaxpc.comWed 8/12/2020 12:11 AMDear RichardThanks for using our productsThe fan spin will back normal when you turn on PC , or noise of fan comes when your system load more (example when your son play games)?if so, you can continue to use it, it may back to regular when system get regular load.If the sound noise always happen from Power supply, then the fan of power supply many damaged or something (or dust) into inside of fan..etc.We\u2019re always here to give your RMA services, we will pass info to Amazon team, to contact you for settle it.Support Team/GameMax IncRichardWed 8/12/2020 1:09 PMThe noise is loud and sounds like it is winding down repeatedly. It happens all the time that the PC is on. Independent of his gaming.It is new and no dust has had a chance to collect on it.I would like to replace it.Thanks,RichRichardMon 8/24/2020 4:11 PMIt is a constant noise that gets worse at times. My son took a video of it if you want it.I would like RMA. I am afraid the power supply will over heat.Thanks,Richardinfo@gamemaxpc.comTue 8/25/2020 12:25 AMHi, RichardThe GM-800 Power supply designed by high speed of fan spin for provide high cooling air, during full load when user using high performance GPU cards.So, it may cause fan noise during high speed fan spin, but it will be reduced speed when system at normal use (such as just use word, excel, or internet browser).If the noise is reduced when you use computer at lower load?Additional:The fan of power position , it up or down ?If your chassis has a cage around with power supply, you may ask your son to take a image to look at here, to check airflow?Thank you, and sorry for more questions.Support Team/GameMax IncRichard RaynorTue 8/25/2020 9:14 AMThe fan is positioned low in the case.The fan sound is constant regardless of the demand placed on the PC ie gaming. It is NOT normal in any way. I have built MANY PC's over the last 30 years.. so this is not normal. I have had power supplies fail before. It is functioning by providing power to the PC but the fan bodes of a failure and subsequent over heating in the future.Air flow is from underneath the PC and the power supply is low in the caseRichNow with SPAM to change my rating:This message is sent from Gamemax customer service.The review you posted about the 850-watt power supply is malicious and defamatory. We are asking you to delete the review you posted. It has affected our product and company's reputation seriously.Action will be made if you do not delete the review.Thanks for your cooperation.Gamemax Company.This Email is being sent daily.I hope you get a good power supply because the Support team is lacking.The ONLY thing I asked is that they explain to me the weakness in their customer support and the thing they will do to try to improve it. They have never given me an answer.....",
