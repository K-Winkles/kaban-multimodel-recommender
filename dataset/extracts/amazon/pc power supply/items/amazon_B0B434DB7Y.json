                "reviewText": "MSI makes quality stuff. My old PC, now 10 years old, has MSI parts that have never failed, so I got even more MSI parts this time around. This PSU has more power than I currently need. I probably could've done an 850. It is very quiet - at least, I can't hear it above the quiet hum of my giant 200mm fans. And this unit has a 10 year warranty. That is the best in the industry, I believe. I like that it is fully modular, so only the cables I need are plugged in.Full disclosure: I made a build mistake and thought I got a defective unit, so did a refund with Amazon before I did a bench test of this PSU, found it worked fine, and then rehooked it up to my PC. The new unit is the one I'll be sending back to Amazon, unopened, because the first one was fine. The only thing I can think of is that, although I checked every cable three times, the power switch connector may not have been fully seated on my MoBo. My case has this weird tiny box around all of those small molex connectors for power, reset, etc. which bundles them together, making them easier to attach to the MoBo, but each one can move a bit inside that box. So it was possible that while the box itself was all the way down when I checked, that the power switch's molex connector was not.Anyway, once that I figured that out, everything has been great.",

                "reviewText": "The MSI MPG A1000G PCIE 5.0, 80+ Gold Full Modular Gaming PSU is a high-performance power supply unit designed to meet the demands of high-end gaming rigs, especially those equipped with the latest GPUs like the RTX 4080 and 4090. Awarding it a commendable 4 out of 5 stars, let's delve into the specifics that make it stand out, as well as areas that could see improvement.Performance and Compatibility: The 1000W output is more than capable of supporting the most power-hungry components, making it a perfect match for gamers and professionals looking to build a top-tier system.

The 12VHPWR connector is also convenient to have for any future GPU upgrades that may utilize it.One last thing to note, it it is able to connect to GPUs that require 3 PCIe connectors.
