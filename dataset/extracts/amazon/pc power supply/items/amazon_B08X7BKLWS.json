This extends the lifespan of components and allows 0dB operation for a longer duration than standard designs. The heatsinks are so effective that fan noise stays whisper quiet, even under full load. Axial-tech Fan Design Better, faster, stronger Originally developed for top-end ROG graphics cards, Axial-tech fan design features a smaller fan hub that facilitates longer blades and a barrier ring that increases downward air pressure. For ROG Strix series power supplies, we've scaled that design to 135mm so it keep things cool at low RPMs while producing less noise. Dual Ball Fan Bearings 2x longer lifespan Different bearing types have unique pros and cons. In a PSU, durability is paramount, so we built a dual ball bearing setup that will last up to twice as long as a sleeve bearing design.",

The cables are nice it makes virtually no noise even with the zero decibel off and you can't beat the price for a legitimate gaming power supply. I'm a bit of an rog Fanboy so take that in consideration. That said I'm an rog Fanboy because I've never had any problems with my RG stuff, it always performs at top level and never gives me any problems. I know they've had a few problems recently so do your research but this power supply is not a problem been running one for about a year the other one for a few months and my brother's been wanting one for a few months.",

                "reviewText": "Over the course of the last 6 months, I have slowly pieced together components for a new personal gaming PC rig. Between finding stuff through either Amazon or Newegg, waiting for stuff to slowly go on sale or come down close to the MSRP, was like fingernails on a chalkboard. Unfortunately, CoVid-19 has caused a lot of price gouging in various items, especially in the market of PSUs.When Amazon Prime day 2020 finally came around, I was excited to see what various computer components would be available. The last two items on my list were a PSU and RAM, of which the latter I ended up finding a good buy on a 32g RAM kit. However, I wasn't so lucky on finding the exact PSU to fit my needs. Not wanting to wait until Black Friday, I decided to bite the bullet and to find a top tier PSU, even if I had to splurge on it. I have already spent too much time trying to piece together components that I needed to build this computer incase something didn't work right out of the box.Since most of the components in my new gaming PC were from ASUS, this PSU caught my eye. I figured that it would tie into the rest of the components nicely, even though the price was about $30 more than I would have liked to have paid, but was it really worth the $155?? (...this PSU looks so pretty!!) After tossing and turning a few night, and seeing that it was quickly going out of stock, I went ahead and bought this bad boy.On the other hand, not to let you guys think this was an impulse buy, I did some extensive research on this PSU. First off, this particular model won't be found on any current heirarchy chart as ASUS uses another famous and good company that makes really great PSUs: Seasonic. Yup that's right, this uses a modified version of Seasonic's Focus Plus Gold series, which is considered a top end PSU. Secondly, the 10 year warranty was another reason that I knew this was a good buy as well.After waiting four days for this PSU to come in the mail (and practically losing sleep over it cause I was so excited to finally build my computer) I finally couldn't wait to rip the package open to see all what was inside. What I found was: The PSU itself (duh!), a translucent ziplock baggie with some nice magnets to either put on the PSU, PSU shroud or chassis of your PC case, some small stickers to place on the I/O side of the PSU, the installation booklet, some velcro strips, four screws, and in a separate, sleek looking nylon bag, all the cables necessary to hook up your components to your motherboard, including two SATA cables with four headers and a molex cable. The cables themselves are sleeved as a whole (not individually sleeved) in a sturdy, black nylon material and there are no \"ketchup and mustard\" wires insight. The SATA and the molex cables, however, are the standard flat black cables. These cables are also VERY long, considering that my case is a mid tower ATX case. These could probably easy reach components in a full tower cases using an eATX motherboard without the need for cable extensions. The cables are also very flexible, not stiff like some other PSU brands with flat cables.When I finally got everything hooked up, and turned it on for the first time, it was beautiful. Even though this PSU has a 0 dB button, with it turned off (the fan constantly running) the fan is virtually silent.In the end, I definitely don't feel guilty splurging on purchasing this product. I definitely recommend ASUS PSU to anyone that wants to add elegance and a reliable PSU to their PC build. It may be a little pricer than some of the other PSUs in the same category, but I guarantee you won't regret it!",

                "reviewText": "Easy to install, yes! Had all the connectors required to hook up my beast of a machine and still have left over connectors. I have 12x ARGB Devices, 6 of which are case fans 140mm x3 and 120mm x3, 4x 3.5\" 7200rpm hard drives, 1x 2.5\" hybrid drive, 1x CPU watercooler, a Ryzen 7 3rd gen and a very power hungry GPU that claims to require 500W. My Ram is running an XMP, my CPU is set to auto overclock and my GPU is also set to auto overclocking.The cables were more than long enough to reach behind the back side of the case to keep them hidden. They were a bit on the stiff side which turned out to help me getting through some of the more difficult to route spots. I was replacing a lower powered PSU and not building a new machine so I had to work with pre-wired devices.As far as fan noise, I have nothing to state bad about the noise. If you take a look at my setup listed above, I have quite a few fans active on my machine. To be honest, I have never heard the fan on this power supply or any others. Once my old GPU would reach the max performance, the fans sounded like they were trying to launch a small plane. My new GPU is so much quieter but still makes more fan noise than the PSU does.I really love the fact this PSU is a modular cable design. This allowed me to use exactly the cables I needed minimizing the amount of cables in my machine and reducing wire clutter. The cables and connectors are all black which made them easy to hide in my machine.",

Una ganga considerando que el precio regular estuvo por ah\u00ed de $3,300.Mi cambio viene de una fuente de 600 W Corsair No Modular que he tenido desde ya hace 8 a\u00f1os, y 2 a\u00f1os con una 3070 y R5 5600X. No noto cambio real pues el sistema ya era estable, as\u00ed que me centrar\u00e9 en la percepci\u00f3n: caja, embalaje y peso hacen que se sienta de calidad. Por el contrario los cables (fuente modular) se sienten de calidad X. Aunque vienen mallados, los conectores se sienten viejos y con falta de calidad en los pl\u00e1sticos conectores. Tuve dos que no entraban bien a la fuente (1 PCI-E y 1 SATA), pero como traen bastantes cables busqu\u00e9 otros y quedaron. Ahh! Y aparte los cable PCI-E que van a la tarjeta de v\u00eddeo son 6+2 Pines!!!. Para una fuente de 850 W deber\u00edan ser de 8 Pines!!. Hasta la fuente Corsair de 600W que ten\u00eda era de 8 Pines y con mejor calidad de pl\u00e1sticos. Tambi\u00e9n un detallito es que el im\u00e1n con el logo de ROG no tiene mucha adherencia, se siente que se caer\u00e1.En general me gusta la marca Asus sin considerarme Fanboy. Siento que lo de los cables le quitan calidad, pero por el precio que pagu\u00e9 y que tuvo soluci\u00f3n considero OK. Si hubiera pagado +$3500 por una fuente con esos detalles si lo calificar\u00eda 4 estrellas.Saludos.",
