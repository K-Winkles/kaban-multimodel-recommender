                "reviewText": "Bought these for my wife's black and blue build. I initially bought a Rosewill (non modular. Epic fail) power supply with blue LED's to run in a full ATX case. Unfortunately, due to the size of the case, there was a lot of strain on the cables and the lack of length for cable management made the inside of the case look like a ketchup and mustard nightmare. After all the money i spent on trying to build her a high end and aesthetically pleasing build, i wasn't happy. Then i found these. While it took me some time to get these routed properly and tamed with the combs (be patient, you will be rewarded), i couldn't be happier with the end result. it really cleaned up the case and now it's looking like the showpiece I had planned in my head. Great product, quality feel and look.",

                "reviewText": "This was my first set of sleeved cables and really didn't know what to expect. I'll be the first to say that these things are really great! I helped my friend do his first build and I really wanted to make it special for him. I bought this and some Thermaltake Riing fans as they were pretty much the coolest orange fans and cables that I could find. The results are stunning! These cables are the stiff kind, but I found them to be really easy to work with. The included cable combs are great and easy to snap on to the cables. The orange is quite vibrant and is very noticeable in a case. The black cabling included with the Corsair PSU that we used are very nice, but this kit really took my friend's PC to the next level aesthetically. I would definitely purchase these extensions again, given the right opportunity.",

Having invested in some RGB fans for my new case and to accent my GPU\u2019s RGB elements I went with the Pink/Black thermaltake sleeved extension cables. The are thick and hold shape very well and come with ample combs for added management. I would recommend these to anyone looking for some nice extension/accent cables for their PC.",

I'm fully Strix'd out so I have enough RGB's to make a Porygon jealous, and I wasn't a big fan of the cables that came with my power supply. These cables are perfect. They're very brightly colored and clearly high quality. I was a little disappointed for $50 they only come with 2 8 pin extensions, and as far as I can tell the only way for me to get more is but another set.",

                "reviewText": "They look a lot better in real life and the extensions feel very high quality. The packaging was really neat and installation is straightforward. However, these cables are a bit fat and are an extremely tight fit within an NZXT comb. Extreme amounts of pressure is needed to force them in place if you have an NZXT cable comb. My fingers are pretty raw and bruised, yet the results were well worth it. They are also pretty long so the smaller your case is the more trouble you'll have hiding them. Would definitely recommend.",

                "reviewText": "These are well constructed extensions with top notch sleeveing. The wire is stiffer and as a result has a wider curve radius than a flimsier wire would but I think it gives a better look to the system build. These are extensions so the extra cable will have to be tucked away somewhere and that's the only detraction from a completely sleeved cable set. The included cable combs are sturdy yet pliable and none broke when I was placing them on the cables and then redoing them when I changed graphics cards and had to add the second eight pin cable to the mix.",

                "reviewText": "Edit - *from 4 stars to 3* - The more time that goes on, the more I hate these, they are a major reason that prevents me from opening my case and moving stuff in it, because they screw ups are just in my face, they are taking up every inch in my case, and I have a huge case, especially when you're running two graphics cards and lots of hard-drives.. I don't recommend these at all, unless you absolutely need them for whatever reason. Just go for full PSU cables, extensions SU CK!! I'm sorry.Been waiting for tooo long to write this review. Had the things for like 3 months, worked with them a lot.And oh god... are they hard to work with, but are great to look at. They were the biggest pain to work with.First things first..Pros: - Stiff, rugged, durable. - So beautiful.Cons: - TOO stiff, to the point where you almost can't bend them around and make tight turns in your case, they just... physically won't. Let me explain, the two rows of lines in the 24pin for example, both rows are the exact same length, and are very very thick and stiff, so there really isn't much room to wiggle them and move them around. If you bend the 24pin to a circle shape, the cable feels like it's gonna break... just really hard to work with. - This isn't really a con because I should've known better, but those are extensions, not stand alone power cables, they are all short, which means more cables in your case to hide and deal with, would've been much more convenient if they were full length stand alone cables, but that's practically my fault for not looking carefully into descriptions and reviews.All in all, now that I'm done working with them, and all I do is looking at them!?? I love them so much!!!",
