                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Powers everything well, but needs adaptation for some motherboards (like mine)",
                "reviewText": "The Good: I had bought a new graphics card that required more power than my stock 250 watt supply could give, so I decided to give this one a try. I chose it because it was cost-effective for me, and I figured that having double my previous power would be enough to handle the low power demands of the motherboard and cpu, while handling the new GPU (nVidia GTX 1650) that needed 300-350 watts (I am not an expert on any of these things, my understanding is basic to intermediate just so you know). There are connectors on this supply unit to handle about anything you'll find inside your computer case; the connectors are also pretty adaptable which helps quite a bit. Size-wise, the dimensions (given on the sales page) are nearly the same as my old supply, so odds are it's basically a near industry standard size and should fit in your case as long as your current supply is standard-sized. The cables are plenty long enough to reach any connection you need to make. The sounds are pretty quiet, just the fan running and it's not a bother at all. It was easy to install and has worked well for about a month so far.The Bad: This first point is irrelevant to many persons, but it does matter for me as my computer has a Lenovo motherboard with an irregular 10 pin motherboard connection. This power supply will fit the apparent standard of 20-24 pins (there are 4 pins that detach if necessary) perfectly, but I needed to acquire an adapter cable for my situation. I don't fault the power supply maker for this as it's a Lenovo design issue, but if you have an irregular power connection, this supply needs some help to function properly. The second point is that with the versatility this supply provides with all the connector cables, it comes at the cost of lots of extra cable stuffed in your case. Be prepared to spend a little time positioning the extra cables or tying them off to keep some free space.The Bottomline: I am satisfied with this unit (so far) for cost and performance and would recommend it if you are either replacing a dead supply unit or upgrading to a moderate GPU over your current one. I'm able to run games at the highest settings (within what the GPU is rated to handle) with no signs of slow-down or overheating, so the GPU is getting what it needs from the supply. If, however, you are planning on using a GPU of the most recent generations (nVidia 2000 or 3000 series/Radeon equivalents), this supply may not have enough power for you, and you would be better off looking into something more robust.",

Computer still not working but I'll have to do more troubleshooting, it does provide power to the motherboard and GPU which is definitely an improvement over doing nothing. Will update again when I get everything working. Great price and easy to connect everything. \ud83d\udc4d",

In fact, so far I have not been able to get the fan to spin up on it, I only hear my GPU spinning up. This has been an amazing change after having a very noisy (old) PSU! It also seems to stay quite cool and delivers pretty consistent power levels. The build quality is solid, so I\u2019m confident it will last for a long time.",

I thoroughly tested this product and always did well in all stress testing, even in over loaded configs this psu is solid.... I'm so glad they worked out the Sticker/logo orientation",
