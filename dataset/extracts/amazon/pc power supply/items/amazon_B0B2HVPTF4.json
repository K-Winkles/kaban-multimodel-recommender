                "reviewText": "This product is made in the U.S. company based in U.S. price is lower than most quality is higher than any cable quality much higher than corsair, seasonic, asus, and probably all only downside to the such high cable quality is that any beginner will fight it because you have to prebend cables to install and because they are such high quality and high durability they kinda fight you to go into place and everything is precisely cut on pci-e plugs which makes it a bit hard to install the +2 on pcie connector because unlike corsair you cant install the +2 and then the 6 pin plug which makes it a bit harder to work with and it makes it hard if gpu barely fits in case but it still can fit if cables can fit just needs to be pushed shut but the connectors are so strong to the point where ironically I feel confident to pull on wires without them falling out and plus it comes with the eco fan feature that only premium seasonic comes with and either way fan is dead quiet even with eco mode off because fan curves are very optimized and fan design is noctua quality psu doesnt seem to get hot and after heavy use it cools off immediately havent even felt heat come out of back also its a very small form factor psu that fits better than the rm650 corsair psu i had fit because it is much more narrow at 1kw psu and this business hasn't gotten much support because they are overlooked sadly they make top tier quality parts if you see this and want a good psu please buy this to help this company out so they can continue their work of amazing parts",

Now it has a smaller fan so sound level is little higher but not much compare to my other psu but i have ECO MODE switch on so dead silent until it hits higher load go up but with other fans in the case and gpu fans running its quiet.the side led load power light looks nice but this would be useless if you have a case that covers the psu.cables a plenty and mesh braided so look nice.overall nice psu with more then enough power for future upgrades.update on the eco mode I recommend to leave it off when you do gaming or heavy load task the fan will turn full speed for a few seconds and it\u2019s loud so better to leave it off. Also another reviewer mentioned about a high pitch sound when you first turn on your pc same here but I think it\u2019s how this psu works so no big deal.",

                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve tried 3-4 top of the lines power supply brand and they all don\u2019t have single PCie to PSU cable. This EVGA has two single 6+2 to 8 pins cable where I can plug straight into OEM split tails x3 that comes with the ROG GPU 4070ti!! Also, the cables are sleeves and thick. Really durable. I hated those new ATX 3.0 flimsy cables that Corsair used, they have caused a lot of problem. The plug keep coming lose and the pins are so thin that it can be easily damaged and the end of the wire is flimsy. I had to return it.",

                "reviewText": "1- ATX 24 Cable: the end that goes to the motherboard is extremely thick and stiff, idk if it have some kind of fuses or resistors, anyways, the thing is that is almost impossible to bend without risk of damage so if for example you want to do a clean build hidding cables you must be forced to use an extension cuz the included cable gonna give you a hard time.2- ECO Mode: on paper looks really nice, in practice... well, at least in my case tends to be very annoying, on light use is fine, however, if i'm playing a demanding game this thing acts in a really weird way, it doesn't adjust the fanspeed gradually, it just goes from zero to \"Jet engine\" in a split second, it looks like fan is only activated when the psu gets hot and tries to cool down the fastest possible; to be honest i have no idea if this is normal or my unit is deffective, the fact is that at least for me \"ECO mode\" is not an option so i've deactivated since day 1.Overall is a good psu, even without \"eco mode\" is fairly silent as long as you don't push it up to it's limits.",

                "reviewText": "PROS: The cables between the EVGA PSUs have the same pinout so it was a simple plug and swap with the old one.CONS: The PSU fan is audible to the ear when in ECO mode as it ramps up to a pretty decently fast speed to cool off the PSU components and then turns off. I rectified this issue by leaving ECO mode off so the fan is always spinning but it's spinning at such a low speed you don't even hear it, and on full system load you still don't hear the psu wind up like it did in eco mode.Overall: 10/10 recommend! The EVGA Supernova lineup for the 1000 watt psus have been a treat to use. I was previously using a EVGA supernova 1000 G2 for the last 10 years and I just decided to upgrade the psu to this one even though the old psu that I had was still working perfectly fine, I just didn't want to take any chances with 6000 dollar PC using a old psu.",
