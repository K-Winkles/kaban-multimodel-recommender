Corsair was bad quality control wont even fit properly with the pins and you've to widen them with a tool . Then got this EVGA and it's great. Day and night difference. The fan was just as they say \"whisper quiet\" . Also has the economy mode. I use it for intense Virtual Reality Gaming computer. Very efficiently built. You wont' even see the fan turn on easily if you're in economy mode. But in regular mode even at high speeds the fan is quiet. All the power cord fits very well. Good manual. Everything nice and clean. I'm very glad I switched to this.",

The instruction manual that came with it was pretty good. The only thing I would recommend is that they label the example photos in the manual to go with the numbered list of \"how to\" instructions. Putting little number bubbles on each photo isn't that hard. Anyway, i really had an easy time of installing and following along. And its working great. A quality product and a great experience using my new rebuilt computer.",

                "reviewText": "Really high quality product especially for the price. The fan is super quiet and it has an eco mode where the fan only turns on under a load. I have eco mode off and it is still much quieter than the EVGA power supply that was on my prebuilt pc. The computer sounds much quieter now. I thought it was my case fans making noise but I think it was my old power supply's fan. It is a semi modular unit meaning all the cables except the 24 pin connector to the motherboard are modular. You only have to add what you need for your pc. Speaking of cables this one comes with more than you will ever need for most pc's and enough slots on the power supply to power them all. Installed easily with no issues.I was so impressed that I ordered another 650W GQ power supply for my other pc although I didn't really need it. For an 80 plus gold rated power supply the price and quality can't be beat. The packaging is very nice as well. Comes with instructions, foam to secure and protect the psu in the box and velcro cable ties to loom the wires that you can use to manage wires inside your case as well. I believe there are 4 of the velcro cable straps. I would highly recommend this power supply. There are fully modular versions from EVGA as well. This semi modular version will give you almost the same function of the fully modular at a lower price. For me it was perfect. Throw in the 5 year warranty as a cherry on top.",

I had an EVGA 450w as my last one, so EVGA is making a good image of themselves to me! But there is just one warning, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!! I put this in using my previous cables instead of the given ones, and in the instructions, in bold, it tells you to use the cables provided, I ended up frying me hard drives (1tb and 4tb drives). I was bummed out because I thought since they\u2019re the same brand, it wouldn\u2019t matter, but no. Luckily it was just the drives broken, but just be careful. But overall, I love it and it\u2019s working perfectly, I recommend it!",

Okay, it's semi-modular but that's not a negative since ALL computers need that motherboard connector anyway. Being a Warehouse Deal I shorted out pins 4 and 5 of the motherboard connector to ensure it worked. The fan is supposed to turn, it did not. I was prepared to initiate a return then flipped the ECO switch which stops the fan from turning until the PSU heats up....Doh! Fan spun normally, and I wonder if that's why it was in the warehouse deals. I'm now a happy camper with is perfectly operating unit.",
