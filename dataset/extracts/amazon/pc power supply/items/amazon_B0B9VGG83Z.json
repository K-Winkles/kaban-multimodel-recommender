GREAT for budget builds and newbs, or even pros..Plenty of power for a rx580 w/ i72600k Playin BFV..Runs the CASE AND CPU fans, MB, SMOOTH. been letting it run daily, for past months. So far so good.. PLENTY of extra cable, and plugs, for any type of connection.. what i like, Is i wont be afraid to cut the harnes ends shorter for the SDD/HDD supplys, since theres like 8x? and there 3ft long... (YOU COULD CUT HALF OF THE sdd/hdd supply CABLE OFF, but i like having the option if i need too use them too ie: power and extra case fan or 4x) Only problem is all wires are BLACK..SO if you wanta splice stuff, you mite wanta check with a voltmeter first..and label) Fits in fullsize case nice.. came with a supply cable. 120 ac US style plug.The fan, its quiet imho.. Its no louder then the RX580 GPU(while GPU at normal op temps 48% fan speed).. I can live with it.. Its not and annoying fan like the DELL i had..Doesnt seem too run that hot. Stays cool in a fullsize case.. I snagged mycooking temp from the kitchen i use for roasts.. An think at normal idle mode, not gaming,lslow easy games, my thermometer says The PSU Outlet air temp is about 81*F right below the PSU.CANT BEAT IT.. MAKE A GREAT PSU FOR A BENCH TESTER BUILD, OR BATTERY CHARGER, ALSO..",

                "reviewText": "I got this to replace a failing 300w power supply with a grinding fan, definitely worth the money and its working great so far with no issues. Only issue i had was user error and plugged in a pcix 6+2 pin the the the 12v port when it needed the 4x4 pins, thankfully i was able to fix it. I wish the cable was longer for the 4x4 pin connector, but i managed to get it work with the case.",

                "reviewText": "I'm building a pc for my little brother so I got this for his system cause I thought I could save some money and it had good reviews. Well I put this sucker in the system, tried booting it up and first thing I noticed was no signal was being sent to the monitor. Didn't think anything of it cause sometimes it can take a minute or two for a new pc to boot up, so I decided to go into the kitchen while it tried to boot up but as soon as I turned around that bad boi popped like a balloon. Ran over to the system, everything was shut off and it smelled like my left nut. Luckily I have my own personal pc so I was able to connect my own power supply to the system to test that the parts were working and it booted up fine. But some people aren't so lucky and would probably be left thinking their pc is dead. It would have deserved 0 stars but since it was atleast decent enough to have safety measures in place to save the pc components I give it 1 star.",

                "reviewText": "I built a budget pc for my son with spare parts laying around, that consisted of an NVMe drive, 3 fans, B550M motherboard, RX6500XT, Ryzen 5 5600X and a strip of led lights. I didn\u2019t want to stress this out, as I haven\u2019t used a cheap PSU in 20 years. I\u2019d like to point out, that this has cheap braided cable wraps over already black wires, which make things look a little less cheap and gives a slightly less cheap look. I did add some carbon fiber wrap on the PSU in the section seen through the window, so my pics are just to point out the black cabling.The fan in the power supply is inaudible over the already fairly quiet case fans. The Connectors on it feel a little brittle, but I personally didn\u2019t have any problems with them cracking, while hooking anything up. Honestly, I recommend this. For a $35 PSU on a low budget gaming pc, that is barely getting used for an hour a day, 2-4 times per week, it has exceeded my expectations.",
