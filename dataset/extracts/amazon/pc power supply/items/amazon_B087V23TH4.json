                "reviewText": "I am extremely pleased with this PSU. I heavily Mine ETH/ETC, I originally bought this as a back up to reduce down time in the event of a PSU failure. I quickly needed to use this PSU when my name brand 1600 GOLD Thermaltake blew up after running it for 4 weeks.Installing this PSU was very easy because its cords are easy to work with and malleable, what I noticed from the beginning was the giant 135mm cooling fan on top of giant heat sinks which is needed when pumping these PSUs hard, I run all my PSUs at 80% load. This PSU comes with the standard 20+4 MB connection and 4+4 CPU connection, another aspect about this PSU is that it has (16) PCI 6+2 power plugs that run on 8 cords, this can handle running (8) Radeon RX 5700 XTs !!! There are (8) stata plugs that run on 4 cords which is enough to handle (8) GPUs, each of those (4) cords have (1) Molex which is good for extra fan plug ins.Running high loads on a PSU can cause Voltage issues and cause systems to error and mining rigs to crash, this has been a big issue in GPU mining, these PSUs seem to handle the loads fine and distribute the Voltage evenly. I have been buying these ever since and currently have (3) of these units running 80% load 24/7 going on 4 months now with ZERO problems. These PSUs cost less than half of an EVGA or Thermaltake and are better PSUs in my opinion. You can buy 2 of these for the price of one name brand PSU and from my experience these run better than the name brand units. I plan on using these on my next supercomputer builds, on top of mining I am also into building maxed out water cooled systems/servers. As you can tell I am very happy with this product.",

It drowns out the two GPU and one CPU fan running at 100%, and this rig is running in an office environment. Also, mea culpa, but I was caught by surprise that it was non-modular. Just looked at the picture briefly and did not see anything about modularity in the description so made the mistake of assuming. I would have preferred a modular supply.

This is a great PSU, is has plenty of power outputs for everything. It handles this task with ease. Its quit and cool, although admittedly I only just started using it so we'll see how it shapes up long term. The PSU runs totally silent (honestly I had to check to make sure the fan was spinning) and stays very cool, even when the CPU and GPU are under full load (8 Gigabyte RX 5700XT all overclocked and Mobo).If you're looking for a quality gold rated PSU, I wouldn't hesitate to pick one of these up! in fact I just bought more!",
