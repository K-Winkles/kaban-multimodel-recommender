                "reviewText": "This product was essentially dead on arrival. There is no worse feeling than building your first computer and as it boots up, the power supply fails for no reason. I contacted Amazon who promised a refund within 2-3 hours of return so I could replace my power supply. A day after I dropped the item off at UPS, I was told it could take up to 30 days and I might only get a partial or no refund. I watched this bounce back and forth between two UPS locations for a week before finally being marked as delivered. I was excited to see my full refund finally credited to my account last night. Unless you want to be jerked around, do not waste your time with this product. After mine didn\u2019t work, I read reviews and noticed the theme. My son felt bad for putting it in the cart for me to purchase without us first reading reviews. I ended up going with a different brand and now my PC works beautifully.",

                "reviewText": "To start I'm running a R5 5600x and an Asrock Taichi 6800XT I had EVGA 600W I didn't trust it would be able to handle my 6800XT. To start the unit is fairly loud but that's under load pending on the game and settings my GPU is easily snatching 300W during game play. However, this PSU has held it's own and it's Apevia's premier model for 80 bucks at the time of purchase it's not that bad. If you're really particular get one of the bigger names if if it gives you ease of mind. Both my GPU and CPU are OC'd and I haven't had any hiccups as of yet only time will tell but at this point in time I would recommend this PSU.EDIT:After 4 months and an upgrade to a 5800X3D this PSU is outstanding no issue at all. I was mistaken about how loud it was this thing is quiet came to realize it was my tower fan replaced it with an AIO and you can't hear anything. Would I use this for the higher tier equipment probably not but for a budget build most bang for your money.",

                "reviewText": "I think a lot of people are wary of Apevia because they're considered something of a \"no-name\" nowadays; most have forgotten that Apevia has been a big name since 2000. Although they used to be primarily known for their PC cases, they started making power supplies in 2005 so they've got some experience under their belts. Honestly for the low price this PSU costs, it works great and is aesthetically pleasing. There are really only 2 minor things that should be noted. The first is the flat molded cables; pretty much every single PSU manufacturer makes cables like this now, so it's not exactly a bad point for just this PSU, but man these things drive me nuts. Always super stiff and difficult to tuck away for neat cable management due to how wide and flat they are. I wish we could get back to the old days of power supplies where every wire was seperate and multicolored, because they were much easier to cable manage. The second point is the noise level of the fan, which a few people have said in their reviews is incredibly loud, while others say it is not loud at all. The true answer is really both. At maximum speed, the fan in the PSU is very loud and whiny, but at anything below maximum speed, the fan is perfectly silent. Realistically there are only 2 times when the PSU fan will hit maximum speed; running torture tests like GPU or CPU benchmarks, and for exactly 1 second when you first power on your computer. Most motherboards will ramp all connected fans to maximum speed for 1 second upon startup as a hardware test to check all fans are working, and then immediately engages PWM or voltage control, depending on 3 or 4 pin headers. This is perfectly tolerable unless you are just really really picky, in which case there are plenty of PSUs that cost 2-3 times as much for you that will not have the 1 second of fan sound. Torture tests also hardly reflect real time performace and 99% of people will never push their hardware far enough to require the PSU to need that much cooling.",
