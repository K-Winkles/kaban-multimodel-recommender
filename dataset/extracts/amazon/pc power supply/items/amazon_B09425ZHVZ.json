The PSU has a ton of LED colors and modes, kinda pain to change but small nitpick. It's sensitive to heat and was the loudest fan in my entire system before changing to a test bench style setup. Now it barely spins up while gaming. I like the cables that come with it, the modular ones are flat and easy to bend. For the price it's an amazing PSU!",

                "reviewText": "I thought my computer had issues with the power supply (PSU). I was not sure, though. I decided to ignore the issues and leave it on and hope for the best. Well, eventually, my computer decided it did not want to power on anymore. I figured I needed a new PSU.I browsed for a while and read some reviews. I saw this product. My previous power supply was 700w and rated. This product Apevia ATX-PM650W Premier is 650w and is also gold rated.I liked the price, and the product was on sale. Amazon showed my order would arrive overnight the next day. So to end the analysis paralysis, I decided to tempt fate and buy this product.So I want to state I don't blame the product for this. But changing the PSU was more of a pain than I thought it would be. But somehow, at the end of this struggle, my computer powered on, and I got to the BIOS. Then soon after I booted into my operating system (OS).Seeing how I just got the product, I can't say much about how long it will last. But so far, everything is working as expected. Since I cleaned up some cables and dust, my computer might even be running slightly cooler now.If there are any major issues, I will update this review.",

I was very disappointed because the power supply was new it hadn\u2019t been messed with prior to this happening. There\u2019s a slight risk that if you do buy this. It might not turn on so keep that in mind. There\u2019s similar reviews like this one that have also said the same thing about it not turning on. Buy at your own risk.",
