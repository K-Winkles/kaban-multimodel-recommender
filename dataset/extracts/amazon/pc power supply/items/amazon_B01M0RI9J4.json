For those wondering, it is a 20+4, with a 6+2 PCIe connector, a 4+4 connector, 4x Sata power and 2x Molex. There is a floppy power connector as well. I used every single connector but the floppy power.It plugged in, powered on, and has been stable for a few days now. No issues at all. It\u2019s fairly sexy, and quiet as well. Zero complaints.",
