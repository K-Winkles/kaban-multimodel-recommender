It supports the modern 12v2.3 power standard with a single 12V rail setup. Boasting a silent 120mm black fan, it keeps everything inside the system cool. Comes with enough cables to connect all the devices you might need. The ATX-ES600W power supply is semi-modular and perfect for mid-range builds for both business and gaming use. IMPORTANT: The power supply will not power on simply by connecting the power cord to both the power supply and wall outlet. Ensure that all the power supply cables are properly connected to the PC for it to power on. IMPORTANT: The 8pin CPU connector can be split apart to become a 4+4 connector by pushing one end of the 4pin down and the other end of the 4pin up for motherboards that require a 4pin power connector. IMPORTANT: The 8pin PCI-E GPU connector can be split apart to become a 6+2 connector by pushing one end of the 6pin down and the other end of the 2pin up for graphics cards that require a 6pin power connector. IMPORTANT: The 24pin motherboard connector can be split apart to become a 20+4 connector by pushing one end of the 20pin down and the other end of the 4pin up for motherboards that require a 20pin power connector",

                "reviewText": "So recieved it took it home then test booted it let it sit for a min running and boom pc shuts off i was like ok. So i go to turn it back on and no go however i had a spare one witch i didnt wanna use for a pc build and tested it with my spare PSU and you guessed it booted right up. I may have just gotten bad luck. But kinda seems odd ykJust gonna leave it and not bother returning the PSU as its not a big deal but still 90 or 100$ would expect a little longer life time especially at 600 watt for that price point.",
