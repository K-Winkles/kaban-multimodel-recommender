I never had any PSU fail in my 30 years of PC building and operating as a hobbyist. I have had many. I have very old PSUs that still work. Inquiring as to warranty here at Amazon, I am advised to allow 48 hours for the seller to respond. My PC went down yesterday + 48 hours + whatever time it takes to resolve the issue. This is a really slow process. I bought this when there were no negative reviews. Now there are several discussing failures at 3, 4 and 6 months. Until yesterday it was cool, quiet and I was very pleased.Was it a good deal? My new answer is a big NO.",

                "reviewText": "This was a dream. I'm graduating from an old monster 1200W PSU that I had in my full tower case. Unfortunately, that thing was too big to fit into modern cases, especially now they all use that annoying PSU \"sleeve\" setup inside. So I needed something smaller, and would not compromise on getting something that was fully modular, and had to be at least 1000W because I have the max internal hard drives I can stuff inside my case.This power supply is quiet, the cords and connectors are high quality, flexible enough for good cable management, and tight connections. The back where the cables connect to the power supply are nicely colour coded for which type cable goes where if you can't get a good full-on look at it to read the text labels because you already installed it in the case then realize you want to swap a couple connectors. Not that I did this! ( I totally did this)It's super quiet. I upgraded from a bronze standard to this gold one and my power bill already dropped a bit. I've already had a power outage and 2 monsoon storms and the protections worked perfect. The metal exterior is nice and firm, not easy to bend just pressing your thumb against it. I especially loved that it came with a tester connector that you can easily plug in so that there's no nervous paper clip action going on. Finally, the price is incredible value. I was on the tightest budget imaginable and desperate to get something modular, 1000W, and small enough to fit and this was the best value ever!",

Turns out this wasn't the issue but since it was affordable, easy'ish to install ('ish by no fault of the product just how computers are set up w/all the wireing apparently), and an upgrade from the 650v i had been using. I decided to keep it.",

                "reviewText": "This PSU seems nice, however I ran into one problem, and it really had me worried. The 24 Pin main board connector will plug into the motherboard with either end. BUT, it will not power up if you have the wrong end plugged in. It took me a little while to figure this dilemma out, but when I reversed the main board connector and hit the switch, everything worked just like it should. I didn't have any problems with any of the other connections, just the 24 Pin main board connector. I would never have thought that it could be connected with either end. I see other reviews on here stating that their's didn't work. Try swapping ends for the main board connectors and try again. Note: the end with the narrow clip goes in the PSU, while the wider clip goes in the main board.",
