Stickers had slightly different font, metal had a different surface finish, the internal components aren't arranged in the same way and the connectors were different (original had YIYI UL-listed brand connectors, this one had generic). I suspect it's not *really* a Dell part, but a well-executed clone. But who cares?It works perfectly, it appears to be completely new/unused, outputs adequate current at the right voltage, and all of the cables are the right length and type, and it has a good weight to it.FWIW, I purchased from the seller \"The Best Part Inc\"",
