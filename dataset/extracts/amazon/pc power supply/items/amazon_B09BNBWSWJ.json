                "reviewText": "When I initially purchased this PSU, I was pleased as punch. It was a good fit for my personal build that fit my budget and the 10 year warranty was a good selling point until...13 months later, the PSU dies. I start the warranty process and was sent a AGT1000 PSU as a replacement since they were out of stock of the AGK850 PSUs at the time. Their initial response and handling of a warranty exchange was both prompt and professional. However, after the AGT1000 PSU arrived DOA, I proceeded to make the video the company requires showing it being non-functional, uploaded it, and sent several emails to the warranty / support email they provide to be completely ignored.The PC this PSU is intended for is my only PC. I homeschool my Autistic daughter with it and have not been able to do any schooling with her in 2 weeks since it is all online and I am unable to teach from phone screen. This has been very detrimental to her academic learning process as well as to her mental health because of the loss of structure and consistency she needs with her disability. This has been also included in my correspondence to Ares Games with no reaction from them.I would highly recommend not doing business with this company simply due to their own business practices in regards to their customers. Absolutely horrible follow through on their part.If they actually follow through, I will amend this review with that information. As of this moment though, I am disappointed in Ares Games and frustrated with their handling of this warranty issue.",

                "reviewText": "Expected a Chinese special in a plain box with crap instructions. PS came well packaged in a good looking box. Inside the box I found the PS to be well padded foam molded to the PS shape. (Good thing too, judging by the smashed box corner, the USPS wasnt gentle with it). All the cables and accessories came neatly in an impressive nylon velcro closure bag. The cables were neatly tied and well labeled. Mounting screws, zip ties, and Velcro cable management wraps were also included. They even threw in a PS test jumper molex connector.I'm pleasantly suprised by the unit and the company that made it so far! Definitely exceeded my expectations.",

                "reviewText": "Thank you so much for the pamphlets. They greatly improved the installation process as I removed my old psu without memorizing which components were connected and to what. I must not have plugged in the 24 pin connector because when I turned the pc on it would restart every 3 seconds but after only pressing down on the 24 pin connector, everything was perfect. Noise is not unbearable as most of my pcs noise usually comes from fans or the random rattling of unknown parts. I was over powering a 450W 6 year old psu so it was way past the time to upgrade. Lastly, thank you for making the psu affordable. $100 for 850W? Good deal! Sucks for people without graphics cards though!",

ARESGAME est une marque inconnue dans l'hexagone et j'ai donc fait confiance aux commentaires. D\u00e8s r\u00e9ception, j'ai pu constater qu'il s'agit de mat\u00e9riel de qualit\u00e9. Le packaging est au top et l'ensemble est plut\u00f4t sympa au niveau esth\u00e9tique. Par contre, depuis l'\u00e9change dans mon bo\u00eetier, seuls les ventilateurs fonctionnement ! Je suis plut\u00f4t cal\u00e9 en informatique, mais l\u00e0, c'est le n\u00e9ant !!! L'alimentation fonctionne avec le testeur inclus, mais pas lorsque la fiche 24 pins est connect\u00e9e \u00e0 ma carte m\u00e8re... Ma config : carte m\u00e8re B550 Aorus \u00c9lite V2, processeur Ryzen 5 5600 X, 12 Go de DDR 4 Corsair, ventirad Alseye et carte graphique MSI GTX 1080 TI Trifan. 750w suffisaient pour faire tourner cette configuration en France... Pourquoi pas au Qu\u00e9bec ??? Si quelqu'un a une solution, je suis preneur. Bien cordialement. Christophe",
