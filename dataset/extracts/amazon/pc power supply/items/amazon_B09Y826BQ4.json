Two days and 3 emails exchanged, they informed me that Dell motherboards need an adapter cable to connect the PS 24 pin cable connector to the 8 pin socket. There is no mention of this in the product post. A lot of frustration and time would have been saved if ARESGAME revealed this in the post. They provided a link to the cable - https://a.co/d/50Bptcp and have offered to reimburse the cost. Another 3 days passed to get the cable shipped and once installed, instant power-up. All ARESGAME needs to do to prevent this is provide the info about Dell power sockets.",

I use this computer primarily for flight simulation and it supplies all the power I need plus some...Overall, it seems to be a well built PSU with a clean look. I'm impressed!",

The only reason it is not a 5/5 stars is because it is not modular, so the cables you do not need are required to stay and you cannot disconnect them, however I recommend this over others.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this (6 months ago as of this writing) because I upgraded my video card and needed more power than the 300 watt unit my PC came with. This was installed without issue in my HP Envy tower The screw holes were aligned properly and it was seated and secured easily. I got the AGW600 80+ Bronze, which was more than I needed by a good margin. It has been working well for a while and I expect it to last a long time.It is a budget brand when compared to high-end name brands like Corsair and others. I wouldn't suggest pushing it to the max. Buy a unit rated for 100 watts or more than you need and you shouldn't stress the components to the max and risk failure under max load. It will still be less expensive than buying a gold-rated power supply by far.The power rating isn't how much power it uses at all times. It is a rating for how much it can provide when needed. Much like a 300 horsepower engine only generates that power at the maximum. I also plug my PC into a small UPS (like a CyberPower CP900AVR) to protect from surges and other power variations. It is worth protecting your PC investment.*UPDATE* - (10/13/22) Closing in on a year of use and I have had no issues with this power supply. It has been a solid performer and is still nice and quiet. I am still happy with this purchase.*UPDATE* - (05/19/23) Well over a year and still no issues at all. I've blown the dust out a couple times with compressed air but that is all. I would buy again, but likely 650+ watt unit due to the new generation of power hungry video cards.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a new power supply for my upgraded motherboard/CPU combo that required 2 EPS connectors, without saying, it has the standard ATX 20+4 connector. In addition, it has 4 SATA power connectors, 2 molex, 2 PCIe 6+2, and there's even a Floppy Disk power connector!It's pretty quiet - you need to put your ear within inches to hear the fan - and what you hear is the air movement, NOT the motor.For the price, this is a great PS.",

                "reviewText": "Its a semi modular power supply and fits my old dell xps 8700. Tprice to quality is unbeatable and works fine. It is just a bit slow to power. Comes equip with a lot of wires and a test kit. Follow the test kit before installing to make sure it works. Otherwise there are a lot of wires coming out of the psu that i dont need 3 cpu wires when i need one also 2 sata with a molex would have preferred no molex and 3 sata. Now i had to install the modular cables one pack pcie express of 3 wires 6+2 and a 3 sata wire just for the cd drive if they had 3 sata out of the psu it would have been less cramped. If you have the money i reccomend full modular if you have a small atx tower like me.",
