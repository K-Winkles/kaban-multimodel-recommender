PC fired right up with new 4070TI card installed and WHISPER QUIET. Stress tested with Cinebench 24 and 3DMark Basic. Both tests ran flawlessly with minimum fan buildup. HWMonitor Pro Temps were nominal and well within normal operation. All I can say is you get what you pay for and this PSU IMHO is absolute perfection.

                "reviewText": "My old Seasonic Focus 800w gold power supply started shutting off my computer randomly after gaming on it for years. So I did my research and decided to get Vertex 1200w PSU for my 4090 rig. Installation was simple and everything worked right out of the box! Hybrid mode on the PSU even dropped my GPU temps to under 32c when it used to averaged out to 40c with the old Seasonic Focus. Definitely worth every dollar and one of the only PSU manufacturers i trust to not explode in my system and fry my mother board when I turn their PSU on.",
