            "Any voltage or PG problem alerts and displays the voltage value, which solves the problem that a group of first generation low voltage testers cannot be tested! It is very convenient and is a rare recognition tool for power sales personnel and companies!",
            "Features: LCD displays output voltage, PG and other parameters. If the parameters exceed the normal value, the buzzer gives a warning signal and the corresponding value flashes.",

        "description": "Description: Introduction to LCD Power Tester: 1: Support 20Pin and 24Pin ATX interfaces 2: Support SATA interface 3: Support 4Pin and 8Pin interfaces 4: Support PCI-E graphics card 6Pin interface 5:Support floppy interface 6:Support ATE hard drive interface 6:The test voltage includes+3.3V 12V,+5VSB,+12V,+12V,+12V,+5V and PG time values. The output line P4/P6/P8/SATA/IDE can also be measured. The external DIE/SATA/P6/P8 is indicated by lamp, and there is no LCD display voltage. Only connected to 24pin or 20pin can LCD display voltage. Size:126x64x18.5mm Working method: A. Plug the 20PIN or 24PIN power supply plug and P4, P6 or P8 into the appropriate position of the power tester. (If you connect the 20PIN or 24PIN interface tester to Alarm and Display LL, you must connect the 4P! Please note that the 4P must be plugged into the 4P position!). B. Turn on the power supply and at the same time \"drip\" sounds twice. If the values of each group do not flash, this means that the input voltage of this power supply is normal. C. If the voltage signal of a circuit is not detected (for example, 20PIN or 24PIN plug) or the detected voltage is outside the normal range, the buzzer emits a \"drip\" warning tone for a long time, and the corresponding voltage or PG value display status flashes, which means that the power supply is defective! Voltage input: 20/40PIN (ATX power supply) Voltage detection:+12V connector 12V+5V connector 5V+3.3V 5VSB 12VPG Connection: Diskette HDD COROM SATA 4pin (P4) 8pin (Dual-CPU) 6pin (PCI-E). Note: Some customers reported that the+3.3V light of the SATA Interface Tester does not light up because there are now 4-wires and 5-wires in the power supply SATA interface on the market! Check your power first. Package List: 1 x Tester",
