                "reviewText": "From a hardware perspective, this device couldn't be simpler. Just insert the card into a free PCI-E slot, disconnect your power switch wire from the motherboard, connect it to the card, and then plug the cable from the card into the power switch pins on your motherboard. The device does not interface with the motherboard; it simply utilizes the PCI-E slot for power.Setting up the device via an iPhone requires no app download, as it works natively in Apple Home. The only potential hiccup is that the included directions make no mention of putting the card in pairing mode. This is done by briefly holding the only switch on the device, and pairing mode is indicated by alternating red and blue LEDs. Afterward, scan a QR code, and Apple Home will guide you through the rest of the setup. Note that your iPhone must be connected to a 2.4GHz WiFi to set up this device, a requirement consistent with other HomeKit devices I've encountered.Once set up, the device performed well for both shutting down and powering on my PC. Some reviewers have noted that Apple Home does not accurately display the true power state of the PC, noting it always shows \"on.\" However, this was not the case for my PC; Apple Home consistently reflected the correct power state without any issues.This is an excellent solution for PCs that lack support for Wake On LAN, especially for users within the Apple Home ecosystem, such as iPhone or iPad users.",

                "reviewText": "You might think the lack of support for android is a problem more likely created by Apple, but I intended to control this device with Home Assistant via the homekit integration. The only problem is it needs homekit devices to at least be connected to the wifi network, and this one refuses to let you do that without an IPhone. When using the cozylife app (which I'm pretty sure is just Tuya based so you could also use the Smart Life app), it says you either need to use the IOS app to apple home.Apart from this, it seems pretty well made with a nice way of powering on the computer - you can either use the built in power button or the device will send it's own signal.",

Also, it always displays as \u201cON\u201d in the Home app regardless of PC state. To turn the PC on, you have to turn the switch off then back on. But, it does work consistently and turns the PC off in a way that allows the OS to do it nicely.",
