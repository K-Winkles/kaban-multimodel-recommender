                "reviewText": "This power supply not only looks great but it works even better. The modular design is what you want for your build so as to not have a bunch of extra wires hanging out in your case. It even has the 12v power cable for the new video cards. Plus you can even use the included USB-C to USB 2.0 header cable to enable viewing stats and controlling fan speed and curves via the Corsair ICUE Software. In order to use this feature, however, you will need a free USB 2.0 Header on your motherboard. For me I had to purchase a Corsair USB 2.0 4 Port Hub as well as a SATA Extension Cable to accomplish this. Those are super easy to install and relatively inexpensive. Overall I really like this power supply but I may be a bit biased having used Corsairs in most of my builds. Do I recommend it? That would be a yes!",

                "reviewText": "I upgraded from a Thermaltake 600W PSU, which was struggling to cope with my hardware needs due to a mixture of mechanical, SSD and M.2 NVME drives coupled with a 6700XT and a Ryzen 5900x processor.Despite my new RTX 4070 graphics card consuming less power than the previous 6750XT an upgrade was due. I initially intended to opt for the 850 RMx series. However, I'm extremely satisfied with my choice of the 1000HXi, which provides extra capacity. The power supply installed in my Thermaltake Core V21 case very easily without any reconfiguring.My PC, equipped with a Ryzen 5900x, is an occasional gamer but primarily used for running VMs and containers, meaning it's on for a significant part of the day. Although this PSU may have a higher upfront cost, its superior efficiency rating will eventually lead to savings compared to less efficient 850 RMx PSU I was initially considering. Both have a lengthy warranty period worth considering in your decision-making process. However, the extra headroom and efficiency were deciding factors for me.Advantages of this PSU include:Plenty of powerThe Zero DB fan, which is my top feature.Its internal components are of excellent qualityFull modularity is a major plus.Many reviews rank it as an A-tier power supply.While I didn't require the iCUE software, it's a nice bonus.It's also somewhat future-proofed with ATX 3.0 & PCIe 5.0 ratings.On the downside:No instructions were provided, and the QR code on the box for the manual didn't work.Also, the cables are somewhat rigid, but they still seem to be of high quality.In conclusion, I would wholeheartedly endorse this PSU and wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again.",

                "reviewText": "I ended up removing the 3.5\" drive cage from my case (Corsair 5000D Airflow) to accommodate the this power supply. It fits, but the drive cage is in the way of the cables coming off the backside of the power supply. Not a big deal since I don't have any mechanical drives to install. But could be an issue if you do. The power supply is quiet and stable. The cables are modular, which is great for cable management.",

If you are going to use it with very high end graphics cards, I recommend buying additional PCIE cables that may be needed. Some motherboards now require a separate PCIE power supply cable which you may need to also buy. This PS had 4 PCIE power places and 2 CPU places. There were also many separate places for powering the HDs and peripherals. The supply worked flawlessly and I couldn't hear it at all.",

Also saw other posts where 1200-1300 was \"perfect\". I just passed all that noise and went straight for this thing. No ones going to say a 1500 watt PSU isn't enough so end of story there. One thing to note is that this is bigger/longer than your typical PSU so you'll need to see if it'll fit and not interfere with your cable management. Other than that, great PSU that'll lasts for years and years.",

When I built my new PC from the ground up last week with a 4080 and 7950X3D, I figured I'd try a different company for power supply just cause. The Thermaltake PSU I branched out with fried a 22TB HDD with valuable data on it! It also didn't power on. This PSU on the other hand, as they say, 'jest werks'. The build quality is great and the connections are solid. I didn't use the iCUE function because I forgot to hook it in, but will update when I try that feature.",

                "reviewText": "I'm really happy with this PSU. I bought it to replace my 14 year old AX850 power supply which was still working. I wanted a new power supply that had a 12VHPWR connector for my new 4070ti instead of using the adapter harness that came with the GPU. And I thought it was time to replace that aging power supply.I used this PSU in a Fractal North case and the new PSU is a bit longer than the previous AX850. Not much but enough that tucking in extra cord length behind it was difficult at times. However, it all worked out in the end.I wish the cables were individually sleeved. I had bought some individually sleeved cables with my AX850 but they wouldn't work with the HX1000i as the latter is Type 4 cables and the AX850 is not. So I'll have to buy a sleeved cable kit or at the minimum a couple of sleeved cables that you can see through the cases windowed panel.Overall, a good power supply that is quiet and so far has been very reliable just like its older brother.",
