                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Corsair RM850x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply, and I must say, I am extremely impressed with its performance and features. Corsair has always been known for delivering high-quality power supplies, and the RM850x is no exception. Here's my review of this remarkable power supply.First and foremost, the efficiency of the RM850x is outstanding. With its 80 PLUS Gold certification, it delivers excellent power efficiency, ensuring that my system consumes less energy and runs cooler. This not only helps in reducing electricity bills but also contributes to the overall longevity and reliability of my system.The fully modular design of the RM850x is a game-changer. It allows for easy cable management, as I can connect only the cables I need and keep the rest neatly stored away. This not only enhances the aesthetics of my build but also improves airflow within the case. The modular design also makes installation a breeze, as I can effortlessly connect the required cables without any clutter or hassle.One of the standout features of this power supply is its low-noise fan. The fan operates silently under regular loads, and I barely notice its presence. It only kicks in when the system is under heavy load, and even then, the noise levels are impressively low. The Zero RPM fan mode is particularly noteworthy, as it ensures complete silence during idle or low-power usage scenarios. This is a great feature for those who prefer a quiet computing experience.The build quality of the RM850x is top-notch. The unit feels solid and durable, and the black finish gives it a sleek and premium look. The cables provided are of high quality and have a premium feel as well. The power supply comes with all the necessary protections, including over-voltage, under-voltage, over-power, over-temperature, and short-circuit protection, ensuring the safety of my components.In terms of power delivery, the RM850x handles my system with ease. It provides ample power for my high-end components, including a demanding CPU and a high-performance graphics card. The voltage regulation is excellent, and I have not encountered any stability issues or power-related problems since installing this power supply.One minor drawback of the RM850x is its size. It's a bit larger than some other power supplies on the market, so it might not fit into smaller PC cases. However, in most standard ATX cases, this should not be an issue.Overall, the Corsair RM850x (2021) Fully Modular ATX Power Supply is an exceptional product that delivers on all fronts. Its efficiency, modular design, low-noise fan, and solid build quality make it a reliable choice for any PC enthusiast or gamer. With its impressive performance and thoughtful features, the RM850x is definitely worth the investment for those looking for a high-quality power supply to power their systems.I highly recommend the Corsair RM850x to anyone in need of a powerful, efficient, and silent power supply for their PC build. Corsair has once again raised the bar with this outstanding product.",

So far I\u2019m very pleased with the power supply and have no complaints on its performance. The power supply is quiet and was easy to install. The cables seem to be high quality and were not overly stiff. I\u2019d recommend this PSU to anyone looking to do a new build.",

                "reviewText": "This is a great quality product from well-known reputable company, a PSU with great modularity and great performance, and frankly a good value. Lots of connectors and on the shift model, if that's what you're looking at side mounted connection points.Here's where the details come in. Is this PSU is primarily for cases with side mounted PSU slots, while in a wider case this might work in a flat mount situation, most likely you are going to need a fairly wide case to house the wiring coming off the supply without bending the wires too much. Even then in some side mount cases, or the PSU is mounted on its side, the wires sticking upright can still impede on certain things, for example with the Lian-Li o11 dynamic XL, The upright facing ports for the connectors on the wires to plug into impede with the bottom hot swap hard drive bay. Now if I really wanted to press the wires down flat against the power supply unit I could probably still fit the hot swap bay in the case, but it wouldn't give much room for the wires, nor allow for much passive heat dissipation from the PSU. In this particular instance with the case I chose a standard end connector output PSU would have been the better choice, as there is ample room at the end for wiring clutter, but due to the hot swap bay mounted above the power supply unit, the side output of the shift model is not intuitive for my case.Removal of the bottom hot swap bay in my case alleviated the issue, but also presents the inconvenience of not having all four hot swap bays available. I never thought I would use this feature, but over the years as I have acquired multiple hard drives and stored up massive amounts of data, it actually comes in handy for moving data back and forth between drives.So no stars docked for the design it's actually great, just really think about whether or not you need the side output connectors and whether or not you will have enough room in your case. They make it more convenient to plug and unplug additional wires without having to remove the power supply unit completely, however you may run into spacing issues in smaller cases.Situationally recommended.",
