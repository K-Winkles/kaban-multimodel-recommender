More cables than you will ever need , they look amazing if you have an open case that the power supply can be seen. They are in five of my latest builds and I will use them on all future builds. Wish they made small units for an upcoming 1u server build. Hats off to Be Quiet.",

I installed Windows 11 and started listening to music while I worked on reinstalling my main programs. All of a sudden after roughly 30 minutes of use, everything shut off in an instant as though the computer was unplugged from the wall. I tried turning it back on, but nothing started up. There was also a static clicking sound coming from within the power supply which told me something was wrong with the power supply. My motherboard was getting some power, but only enough to light up all the lights including my ram sticks, but nothing started up. Also the unit has very sharp edges and I had to handle it carefully so as to not cut myself. I expected more out of Be Quiet!, a German brand with seemingly high quality products, but alas was disappointed.",
