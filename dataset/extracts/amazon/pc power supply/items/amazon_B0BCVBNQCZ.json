Still works great for my 4080 and haven't faced any power issues with the included cable, but if this matters for you (4090 or 3090) then you may want to consider buying a cablemod custom cable or just using the GPU's included power adapter with the PCIe power cables (again, only comes with two PCIe male to PCIe male power cables). Other than this lack of included power cables, the PSU itself works great with no issues on my Ryzen 7900x + RTX 4080 build.",

I was putting in a 3080 for the wife's system, and removed the 750 sfx from the Lian Li Mini case I had in which was powering a 2080ti fine. Plugged up everything, and went to power it up nothing. Tested a few things, nothing, did the paper clip pin test, nothing, green and black wires, etc. So I had to return it. I put the 750 back in and it all powered up. I think the packaging might have been its down fall, it was shipped in a plastic wrap, thin bubble wrap, type of package. I could tell it took a few bumps, but the card board packaging for the PSU wasn't really dinged up to bad. I hoped for the best ,and oh well.",

This made my build difficult because I couldn't test out different cable routing options. You need to experiment even more to fit everything in when building a small form factor PC (the kind where you'd need a small power supply like this), so being able to unplug things becomes important.",
