                "reviewText": "First impressions of this unit are pretty decent. Vetroo has never failed to impress me, so I had high hopes for this PSU. The presentation is pretty good all things considered. The power supply itself comes in a black pouch and the cables are in their own box. The modular cables are all tied with Velcro straps, so the extra cable management is greatly appreciated. Though, Vetroo does bundle in some bigger Velcro straps.Installation is about what you'd expect of a computer power supply. You install the cables you want, screw it into the case, I won't bore you with the age old process. Though, it's worth pointing out that this PSU has built-in PCI-E 5.0 cables which is very nice to see, especially at this price point. I'm currently not at max capacity of this unit with the system I'm using this with, but this is great as I have plenty of headroom for upgrading to beefier components. At any rate, it does a splendid job of powering my system.When it comes to sound levels, this is honestly where this unit falls short. I do not have the knowhow nor resources to determine the quality of what's inside this power supply, but whatever they're using, there's some coil whine. This isn't terribly uncommon, but in all my years of computer building, this is the first time I've had this issue with a power supply. The second the unit is fired up, there's a very faint amount of coil whine. The fan is also a little annoying, even at idle. I may need to experiment some more, but ECO mode doesn't seem to impact noise levels. This may be something that will go away with age, but something to keep in mind when getting this. Noise is tolerable however as I have hard drives and 5 case fans, though your mileage may vary.Overall, for the price, with the decent feature set and seemingly decent build-quality, if Vetroo honors their 10-year warranty, you honestly can't go wrong with this power supply.",

Time will tell, the longer it lasts the better the deal.",

I slapped this bad boy in and no more crashes and steady consistent power delivery to my pc components. Works perfectly fine in an AMD 5800X3D, 7900XTX combo build. I am unfamiliar with the Cybanetics testing, but it was displayed on the image for the front cover on the description, yet it wasn't anywhere on the box or in the manual that came with it so Idk if that's accurate.I have built many PC's for myself and my family over the years and I wouldn't say I'm pro, but slightly above amateurish and have no problems with cable management using this psu. The wires for the 24pin to MOBO is robust yurr gayy so getting it to fold and cable tie it was surprising as it was very bulky, but still able to hide under the covering inside the chassis.Overall quite happy with the purchase, and as long as Vetroo honors the pirate code of honoring the warranty if it fails then its a steal of a deal for 120 buckeronies!",

Read reviews, and people were saying it has bad coil whine, but not everyone. So I figured if it's really bad, I can just return it. I've had it for about a month and a half now, and it's been flawless. No noise whatsoever. Handles my 7900xtx just fine. I like that it comes with all white cabling also, really helps cut down on buying extenders to complete the aesthetic. Even comes with white velcro straps. Also pretty great that it comes with ATX3.0 and PCIe5.0 hookups, so it's also future-resistant. Overall I'm super happy, I don't know if this is some up and coming brand or what, but I have confidence in them now.",

It worked wonderfully, came with great cables, and felt very well-made. Then, after 8 months, I was 5 minutes into gaming and it just died.If you look at the ad (and title) for this PSU, it says \"10 year warranty.\" So, I reached out to the company as instructed to utilize the warranty. They acknowledged this product does indeed have a 10 year warranty. When asking them how to utilize the warranty, Vetroo stopped responding. So, there is a warranty, but good luck trying to use it as they will not respond to you.I am absolutely disappointed with this purchase as the warranty was one of the reasons I took a gamble on this brand. So, if you are okay with knowing they will not help you utilize the warranty and that you are out of luck if it dies, then I hope it works out well for you. As of now, I will never buy from this company again because they do not standby by their own products nor will they help you outside of Amazon's 30 day return window.",

Install was easy, cables included were good quality, and no issues reaching mobo, cpu, etc. Have had no isssues at all. I reached out to Vetroo about the warranty and they responded pretty quickly.Minor issue: It isnt a super quiet fan, but quiet enough for most people. If you want a super quiet fan I would look elsewhere.UPDATE: I Just got a 7900xt and going to put this through some testing at high loads. Will update when done.Did some testing using Heaven benchmark. It basically puts your gpu/psu through an incredible amount of strain. It pushes your gpu to the limit (and goes way beyond everyday use), and psu has to supply alot more power. Anyway, let the test run for 35 minutes and both GPU and PSU passed with flying colors",

                "reviewText": "I was a bit hesitant to get the Vetroo 1000W PSU as it had a good review on the Hardware Busters website though it had been removed as a few people reported a noisy fan. Also as it was not a tier 1 vendor like Seasonic, Superflower and the majors like Corsair, EVGA, NZXT and Asus etc. it was a bit of a worry but the pricing for an ATX 3.0 and PCIe 5.0 ready PSU was exceptional, especially for a 1000w unit.Overall this is a very well made PSU, it is compact with all the cables included with the added bonus of the cables being colour coded, so in my case, all the cables are white to go with the white PSU. Easy of installation was great and everything went together with no issues and all the cables are modular so you only use what you have to. The dedicated 16 pin GPU cable is perfect and fit very well to the 4090 so again no issues.I am running a fairly powerful PC with a 13700K overclocked and a RTX 4090 but this PSU handled this with no issues even when stress testing! Sound though it can get a bit loud at full tilt was not an issue and with the eco mode it is wisper quiet and with normal use like gaming, you will not hear this PSU...I will provide an update in 6 months or before should anything go wrong but for the moment, this is a great value PSU.",
