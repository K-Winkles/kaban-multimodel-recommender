                "reviewText": "Used this for my garage computer left over parts build (Ryzen 2600x/RTX1660). Plenty of power for this build, but pay attention to the lack of pcie connectors on the power supply. Overall, if it meets your power needs, the price is right, it's quiet, and works as it should.",
