                "reviewText": "This is a great PSU. It is a bit noisy if you are anal like me and others on this review page. If you'd like to void the warranty and put a quieter fan in this PSU my suggestion after trying the noctua route is to not use noctua (the fans people are recommending on this review page are not rated for this psu in terms of cooling efficiency and in my case the fan wouldn't even turn on unless I hooked it into my fan header on my motherboard even though its 12v in the psu and on the noctua fan. A more proper recommendation and expert advice would be to purchase Delta AFB0412HB 12V DC 0.16A Fan 40mm x 40mm x 15mm from ebay for 6 dollars. Be sure to check the polarity of the 2 pin/wire for this fan to ensure it matches the existing scheme/configuration. I believe its reversed but like I said, check for yourself. But Delta AFB0412HB 12V DC 0.16A Fan 40mm x 40mm x 15mm is a much better option than the Noctua. Don't waste your money on the noctua 40x10mm as not only is it too small and would require duct tape to cover the gap on the outside of the psu after its installed, its not even strong enough to push air in an efficient manner. Anyhow I wish you all good luck in your DIY this psu. For those not that are not ANAL like me, the noise is really not that bad. But I'll let you be the judge as I have tinnitus so I hear ringing in my ears anyway.",

                "reviewText": "Little loud, little pricey, and I wish it was modular -- but it's important that I rate this good - because when I bought it 6 months ago, I think it had a 3.5 or 4 star review overall, and that almost wasn't good enough for me to spend the money on it. But I have stress tested it under heat, dog hair, vibration, weird power surges, poor cable management, and wiring mistakes. I'm told replacing the power supply's internal fan will help with noise, so I came back to the listing to check out the specs. Totally recommend this PSU for someone building a tiny ITX computer. Mine is powering a 1660Ti ventus xc (physically modified to fit case), MSI H510i Pro, 16gb ddr4, i5 10400f, m.2 ssd, two sata ssds, and an noctua NH-L9i. Never had trouble! And I am playing the latest games at high settings despite having a 9x13x3 computer.",

                "reviewText": "If you have ANY experience with computer hardware, you may know that a computer naturally isn't very loud unless it's dusty, cheap, or under a heavy work load. This power supply makes a sound that isn't exactly what I'd call \"annoying\", but definitely present. It's like the sound of a tower fan in your room that's kind of old; it's not annoying, but it isn't soothing like white or brown noise. Besides the noise, the cables are stiff. I haven't built into my ITX case yet, but using this PSU as a bench supply is not exactly easy. I'm going to mod a Noctua 4x10 FLX into this PSU and give an update within the month.UPDATE 9/9/20After replacing the fan, cooling seems fine (despite cfm differences in fans). There's 5 screws: 4 sides screws (one warranty screw) and 1 screw underneath a version sticker (mine included one). With the 12V FLX variant of the Noctua 4X10, I was able to replace the fan. Another thing to note is that the stock fan seems to be stuck in place with the metal fan grill plate (besides the 2 screws that keep the fan in)-- I had to break the fan to actually remove it. It's not 100% silent, but WAY WAY more tolerable and almost silent within a foot from the supply. Will update again if there's any overheating issues.UPDATE 8/28/21 (Almost a year of use)I've had no issues with overheating, shut offs of the power supply, or noise complaints within my case.UPDATE 8/18/22 (Almost two years of use)Still no problems with the modified Noctua fan and the computer that\u2019s using it is on at least 6-10 a day. No overheating, no shut offs, no weird sounds.",
