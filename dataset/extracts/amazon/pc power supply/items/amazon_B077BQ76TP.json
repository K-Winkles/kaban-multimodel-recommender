                "reviewText": "It was a little alarming that this PS is so much lighter than the original but that didn't stop me. It is a little quieter than the original. I am glad I read the instructions about the cable ends being tweakable because I did have to separate one so it would work on my old HP Motherboard. Once separated I nearly needed a magnifying glass to determine which of the two (4 pin) connectors would attach properly. The other unneeded 4 pin connector has no chance of shorting against anything so I did nothing special and let it find its own resting spot nearby. For people that go overboard on disconnecting cables there was a reminder note on the instructions about being sure you MB power-on button cable is attached. I presume it's so that people don't think using the power switch on your new PS will turn on your computer. Most machines have their own separate case button that is used to turn on the machine and the one on the power supply just gets left in the on position. My only trip up on this repair was a detent (protrusion) on the computer case that is there to secure the PS firmly at the opposite end from the 4 screws so there is no chance to vibrate. I wanted to pry it away but it only needed a really firm push to release the failed supply for removal. I hope this helps. Long live desktop Internet PC's!",

                "reviewText": "WARNING... Read below before you buy this!I purchased every item brand new to build a new gaming PC (most of the parts were Amazon Prime items). There were many parts that I had to order. This 450 watt Apevia power supply was one of the first few items to arrive. It took almost a month before I had everything to get the computer completed. Finally I was able to assemble the whole PC with all brand new parts that I ordered on Amazon, other then the CPU (eBay). I have assembled MANY gaming computers in my lifetime. I have never seen this before... I hit the power button and it starts right up, yay I was thinking. So I started downloading Windows 10 right away. It got to about 10% done (the PC has been running great for about 15 minutes now). Then all of the sudden, a bunch of sparks flew out of the back of this brand new 450 watt Apevia power supply and my PC immediately shuts off and it put out an electrical burn smell. So I'm thinking great, now I have to buy another power supply. First I take my 500 watt EVGA power supply out of a computer that I was selling. I have used that PC for months so I knew the power supply worked. Then I hit the power button on the new PC again and nothing this time. With hours of carefully switching parts around, I find out that this Apevia power supply also fried my brand new motherboard. So I go try to return the Apevia power supply to find out that my return window closed. Same with the motherboard. So now I am stuck with a useless fried power supply and motherboard. I missed my return window by just a few days, just my luck. If the fan adapter that I also ordered on Amazon showed up on time, I would of been able to return the power supply and the motherboard.",

It did not need 450W but this was one of the best deals at the time of purchase.The power supply feels like Apevia was very cost-efficient in its construction, including the materials used. The cords for CPU and motherboard power are short so cable management is limited. That said, it works and didn\u2019t cost a lot. That is all I was looking for. If it stops working, I\u2019ll update this review.",
