                "reviewText": "I have an Inspiron 530 that i wanted to upgrade the Graphics card for (to use for CAD and Gaming, etc.), but the issue was that the Power supply was at 350W and i did not want to risk frying my computer(Yes, that can happen if you dont have enough power). I had a budget of $210, and i got the Sapphire Radeon R7 260X(Which is an amazing GPU by the way, check it out). The graphics card was about $150 and i needed something that could fit in my budget. Being priced at approximately $31, this was a perfect fit for me. At $193, i got 2 day shipping and got the parts.HOWEVER: When i was installing this, i got a bit confused on the parts. It has multiple Peripherals, and only 2 SATAs. Now, The 2 SATAs i used for my 2 hard drives, but my DVD drives were unpowered, so they would not work. Be sure to look at the box, and it will tell you all the parts you need. So i ordered 2 adapters for Male SATA to Female Peripherals, at $4 a piece. Add another $8 to the original $193, you end up with $201.When using the product: This Power supply is off the rockers. The fan is so quiet, i can barely tell that the Computer is on. It has 380W Dedicated to all other accessories like Graphics Cards, etc. The system i have only uses 120W out of the 500W total. This thing is absolutely perfect, and when matched with the Sapphire Radeon R7 260X, this system can be used as an ultimate Desktop.My Specs:Intel Core 2 Quad Q8200 2.33 GHz4.00 GB DDR2 RamWindows 8.1 ProSapphire Radeon R7 260X- 2GB GDDR5, with DVI, HDMI, and Display Port(Comes with DVI to VGA Adapter)Dell Inspiron 530 Model Case(2009 Built)If you are looking to upgrade your power for gaming,etc. Then pair this with the Graphics card i mentioned. But ultimately, This Power Supply has got to be the best power supply i have ever bought(The only one ive ever bought as well :D). $31 Well spent on a great piece of equipment!!4 Stars rated since i had to buy the Peripheral Adapters.",

I ordered another and it died in 2 days. They sent a replacement (I had the hassle of returning the dead one). The replacement lasted from mid September until mid November, then the PC started crashing after a couple of hours use (reboot, then crash in a couple of hours again). I installed my backup PS (another brand) and the computer has been working fine for 3 days being on most of each day. I tried using their website and contact wouldn't submit. I've ordered another PS from a different maker. I'm done with these people, for good.",

Original PSU is SFX form factor and is one of those briefly manufacured around 2005 or so and having a very high current rating on the 3.3V and 5V rails. The now-failed original had ratings of 3.3V @ 22A and 5V @ 30A. A modern replacement SFX form factor PSU of suitable ratings seems to be unavailable - even the premium high power 800W or 1000W SFX PSU's don't supply anywhere near this much current on the 3.3V and 5V rails.This Coolmax PSU is ATX form factor (big) and should not and does not fit the subject PC's SFX form factor (small) case. It was therefore strapped to the side of the PC's case, and the case's cover left off. The Coolmax-provided cables were sufficiently long to reach the motherboard. This jury-rigged external PSU setup is working well. All output voltages are right on spec, and the Coolmax PSU runs cool, even though the Coolmax's 5V rail is rated at somewhat less current than that of the original PSU. The original PSU will be repaired and reinstalled as time permits, but until then, the old PC will chug on, powered by the externally-mounted Coolmax.",

Furthemore, you are better off buying the 2 rail Coolmax V-500 for the same price 0f $34.99 as the single rail I-500. The only reason I bought the single rail I-500 model was because it was advertised as having 2 SLI 6 pin connectors, however the device has none of that. It is just a poorer version of the V-500 model with the same connectors. Very disappointing and false ad.",
