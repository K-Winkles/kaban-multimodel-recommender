The only hiccup was the non-labeled connectors. The 8-pin connector doubles as a 4-pin connector and only goes in one way. The literature did not indicate this, but I knew it was compatible. Some without this knowledge may not, and get confused. Other than that I am quite pleased, especially with the price. Good quality unit.",

                "reviewText": "Just installed this today. Ordered this to replace the original 250 watt power supply in a Dell Vostro 200 Slim Tower desktop PC, which finally died after several years. Was very surprised at its weight - it's much lighter than the original. Not sure how that translates to quality or reliability. It's just slightly smaller than the original, which is a good thing. It fit perfectly, and the wires are longer than the original's wires - no issues reaching the connections that needed to be made. Install was super easy, just 3 screws, plug in connectors and you're done. PC powered right up and I was surprised how quiet this power supply runs. The CPU fans run MUCH louder than this power supply. It comes with a rather short power cable, but I chose to use the PC's original power cable.So far, so good, and a great deal for the price paid. The original, if I could find one brand new, would have cost me about $20 more. And this replacement has more connectors and 50 watts more power than the original.If it starts to act up or dies prematurely, I'll try to update this review.",

                "reviewText": "The \"Slimline\" power supply that I bought one year ago (made by Replace Power) finally died. The cooling fan stopped working. Being a TFX form factor, this (of course) limited my choices. This Apevia had okay reviews, and is a reasonable price. So far -- after 1 hr -- it is running fine. It fits in the spot, has the correct cables/connectors, and the cables are long enough for my application. It is definitely not the quietest PSU I've ever had, but for the price I'm okay with it -- I'd probably put it in the mid-range. If you want something really quiet, this isn't it. But if you need a TFX at a budget price, this Apevia may be a decent choice.UPDATE: After a month, I finally sat down and got into the BIOS to set up quiet mode on the PC. Wow, the difference is amazing. Now, if I want to run full graphics mode (i.e. games), I'll have to go back an put it on performance mode. In the meantime, this'll do nicely.",

                "reviewText": "The Apevia PSU worked perfectly (nice and quiet too) and addressed the issue with the PC not powering on. The PC was really dusty inside after being used for years near the floor in a restaurant. I cleaned it thoroughly when the old PSU was removed. The restaurant owner told me the old PC runs faster than it did before (no doubt due to the CPU throttling down due to the heat build-up). As I recall, the original PSU was 150 watts. It's nice having a more powerful PSU although I doubt they will add components to this old machine that would require the extra power. Still, if the old one was borderline sufficient, the replacement will be more than sufficient. It's been about 3 months since installing the Apevia PSU. Given the heavy PC usage, I'm confident this PSU is up to the task and won't hesitate to shop Apevia in the future.Here's a portion of an email I sent to the person who asked me to find a replacement PSU that you might find useful...\"What made the search difficult is trying to make sure the unit fit the case width reserved for the PSU. There are two metal standups placed 2.625 inches apart. If the PSU is wider, the PSU will not lie flat on the case bottom. Here are the Apevia PSU dimensions:80mm x 170mm x 62mm (3.23\" x 6.75\" x 2.5\") - W x L x HThe unit actually sits sideways in the case with the fan on the side facing toward the inside of the case. As a result, the 2.5\" height is actually the width and the 3.23 width is actually the height. As I mentioned, the case provides a width of 2.625 so it's about 1/8 inch wider, which should be close enough to accommodate the replacement PSU. The back of the PSU has the plug connector on the top left when the PSU is on its side. This matches the old PSU and where the case expects the plug to be located. Additionally, when the PSU is on its side, there is a screw hole at the top middle and two more on the bottom left and right. This also matches what the case needs.I only found 3 PSUs on Amazon that could fit the case. The Apevia was the only PSU that had only 4 and 5 stars. With any luck, the restaurant's PC will be working Thursday night. We just have to hope the issue is the PSU.The current PSU says FSP150-50GLT on it. This size PSU is referred to as a TFX (thin form factor) PSU.\"",

                "reviewText": "The PSU arrived well packaged or so I thought. Upon inspecting the pins I noticed some were bent. Not compatible with my Dell optiplex 5040 sff as it doesn't have the square 4 pin power cable. It does have the 8 pin required but to use the 4 pin you would need an adapter if that's even possible I'm not sure. Not going to risk it as I don't want to fry my components. I will begin the return process which I've heard is easy going.",
