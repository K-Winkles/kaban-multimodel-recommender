I use this power supply to run all of my electronics, this includes: one extruder, an 8x8 silicone heatbed, arduino mega with RAMPS, four Nema-17 steppers, some small LEDs, and three small fans. I have not had any issues with this powersupply. The fan inside is indeed noisy, but not any louder than my printer so I don't mind.Everything about it seems great. It starts up very quick and shuts down really quick. I have not run it for really long periods of time yet, so I can't speak about that aspect. I will be running it for long periods soon and if I have any issues, I will be sure to update my review.Bottom Line: Item was very inexpensive while working great. When I build my next 3D printer I will certainly but another PSU like this. I definitely recommend this item.",

                "reviewText": "Good little power supply. I'm using it in a hobby capacity and seems to work fine. One thing that has been mentioned casually is that it does not have a power cord. While this is true, a more accurate description would be: It does not accept a standard power cord. This is as it was designed so it is neither a plus or minus.If you are going to use it in a capacity other than hardwiring it to romex or other in-wall wiring you will need to re-purpose a power cord from something else. It can be any cord with a three prong and three wire configuration. I have attached a photo to show how I wired it up in hopes that those looking to use this as a DC 12volt power supply in a hobby or other capacity will have all available information. There is no documentation at all, but the case is labeled adequately.The fan is a bit noisy, about twice that of a newer refrigerator I'd say (as I'm currently sitting equidistant from both), otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.",

You can\u2019t pull a full 30 amps though, it is more like 28-29, I think that is because of the fan but will do more than I will ever use just got it so I don\u2019t have to worry about it heating up like the smaller ones and you shouldn\u2019t run these above 70-80% of there max anyway.",

                "reviewText": "Summary:A decent enough product at this price point, but I was hoping it would last a little longer. It might for constant loads (LED lights, etc.).One star off for failing after only a year on low load.One star off for mode of failure.Thermal management seems acceptable for lower loads (15-20A)Voltage is reasonably consistent under various loads.Fan noise is higher pitched and constant, but my AC is louder.It should be understood that I realized this was a cheap, knock-off product, so I didn't expect it to run at full load or to be in service for an extended period. An on-brand product would have received a very poor review for this type of performance and mode of failure, but on-brand products are a whole lot more expensive.Full Review:This failed one year and change after purchase. I have generally run it at around a 50% load cycle on a 3D printer that draws a maximum of 10 amps and a typical load of 6 to 8 amps. The supply didn't seem to have trouble running that load and rarely became even moderately warm (which is as it should be at 1/3 rated load).To comment specifically on fan noise, the fan is unnoticeable if my AC is on, but is otherwise a constant hum. The fan runs as expected at this price point, but it does have a bit of a whine to it.It died today. The fan doesn't spin, so the 12V bus appears to be completely down. Maybe it wasn't meant for such frequent use, but I thought it would be fine at 1/3 load. That was disappointing. I've had it on a UPS, so surges or line noise weren't factors.The real bummer was that it failed in the middle of a print, which was a bit inconvenient.Nothing smells of smoke and nothing looks burnt. Initially I couldn't see the issue, but it looks as though one or both of the mains capacitors may have gone bad. I'm glad they didn't pop. One capacitor doesn't register as having any capacitance and the other measures at half its rated value. One came close to blowing (the top of the cap has begun to bulge), so perhaps some style of protection circuitry cut off mains power internally, or maybe something else broke before the capacitors did.This is an inexpensive variant manufactured overseas (China, specifically) using knock-off components, etc. etc. so I didn't expect it to run at rated capacity or even 2/3 capacity, but I was hoping that since I was at 1/3 load rating it would last a little longer. You get what you pay for.It seems like other people haven't had my specific issue with this supply based on the top ratings. My (untested) theory is that my printer was a highly variable load which put more strain on the internal components than most comparatively constant loads which would typically be hooked up (LED lighting, for instance).One important note is on the cooling on this system. It has a fan and the proper venting throughout to make the fan useful for cooling the main board. The serious heat generating components are screwed into a heat sink which in turn is attached to the case. There's a thermal pad between the heat sinks and the case. The amount of thermal compound between the heat sinks and the components, however, is not particularly impressive, mainly because it has been over-applied, which doesn't make for ideal heat transfer (though it's better than one's I've seen that don't have any thermal compound). The heat sinks are also a little smaller than I would prefer to see, but only by a little and at least it has one that's somewhat close to the correct size. While it may handle its rated 30A for a minute or two, I don't know that I'd trust it with more than a 15-20A load for extended periods.I'll update this review once I get around to replacing the caps. The internals are likely fine aside from the caps, but it's just a question of how many caps I need to replace aside from the two mains ones.Oh, one last thing: I pulled this open because it was out of warranty and I know what I'm doing. I wouldn't recommend that most folks do that for safety reasons. So, don't do something silly.Would I recommend it?If you have a constant, reasonably low load (small motors, LED lights, etc) that aren't too sensitive and have a low replacement cost, this probably works great and is low-cost.If you are willing to replace the caps, then it will likely last longer and could possibly be used for higher loads.If you need a reliable power source for medium or high loads (like for a 3D printer), then find something on-brand to use as-is or modify (like an xbox power supply).",

                "reviewText": "Unit arrived and was packaged well. You need to add your own pigtail for ac power. The switch to choose between 110 and 220 volts ac was already set to 110. Screw terminals for ac and dc are very close and out in the open so it may not be the best option to sit on a desk but should be put in some kind of enclosure especially if little kids are running around. My icom 7000 draws 22 amps when transmitting but normally draws 1.2 amps. There is a voltage adjustment and mine out of the box was putting out 12.12 volts. I adjusted it up to 13 volts for use with my radio. It could be adjusted from 10.5 to 14.5 volts. When transmitting and pulling 22 amps the voltage drop was from 13.03 down to 12.98. I have been using mine for 3 days with no issues. Reports from other operators lead me to believe there is no RF noise problem. I do not hear anything on the receive end and all reports are clear from my contacts. Initially I purchased this thinking I would give this cheap one a try and probably have to move it over to one of my R/C battery chargers but I am extremely impressed and plan to continue to use this with my radio and order a second for use with my battery charger.There are several comments regarding the cooling fan being loud but I cound it to be about the same noise level as my PC cooling fan. I think the fan noise level is acceptable and not excessive.",

Even after adjusting the fine tuning for voltage, this thing varies all over the place.
