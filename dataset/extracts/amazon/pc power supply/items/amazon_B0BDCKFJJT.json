                "reviewText": "This is a pretty decent wattage and awesome power supply. It is perfect for the simple gaming rig provided you have the right parts. I used this power supply with my i7 and GTX 1650 and it powered everything just fine. In terms of connection, there are several connectors (one being super old). It comes with the main power connector, cpu power connector, four sata connectors, two PCI-E connector, two molex connector, and surprisingly one floppy connector (a bit old). I assume this could be a good replacement for some older hardware computers given the floppy connector. This power supply can work great with mid or full size towers. This power supply is easy to mount the power supply. I did a test on all of the connectors and they work fine. There was no short or issues with power. One thing that is REALLY nice about this power supply is the fan. The fan is really quiet for this price range and wattage. It keeps at a pretty low noise level even when the device is on a heavier load. It is pretty much dead silent and there is no coil whining or anything. It does not get really hot or too warm. The fan does a good job with cooling. This provides simple 500 watt worth of power which is more than enough for those smaller gaming rigs short of powering two graphic cards. I actually tried this on my 1080 TI gaming rig and it actually was able to power the rig without much issue. Again you can use this as a replacement for your older computer or gaming rigs if needed. Like many other lower end power supplies, you cannot remove connectors to make cable management easier. That being said, it does come with cable zip ties in order tie up the cables to make it easier to keep clutter down in your tower. The black color is pretty nice but it does get scratched up pretty easily so you notice the silver metal in the back. The cables are all long enough to work well in a full size tower from what I can tell (it also depends on how you are organizing your cable) and all the connector are secure. If you are going to organizing the cables through the back, you may run a little short on the full tower. Overall I think this is a good power supply for a simple gaming rig given you are not running more than one GPU. It is not super loud even when handling a higher load. It is relatively quiet most of the time which is pretty awesome. It comes with the four mounting screws and the standard power cord which feel a little flimsy but it works. There are several zip ties you can use to keep the cables organized. This is a pretty good power supply to have for a decent price.",

Easy to install with more than enough extra connections with more power than my old 350w supply. Computer works flawlessly. The unit is quiet and very easy to install if you have basic computer knowledge. Even if you have limited skills you can replace the power supply by just unplugging the old plugs one at a time and plugging in the new ones one by one. Very happy with the product",

                "reviewText": "I just had a power supply fail in one of my gaming systems. I had just finished building a new PC so I didn't have a whole lot of money to throw on it. When I saw some of the reviews for Aresgame power supplies (a company I'd never heard of) I was a little skeptical at first but decided to try it out. Buying inexpensive for a power supply can sometimes be a gamble. I could tell as soon as I held the item in my hands that it was great quality. They included a testing tool which is a great idea. I was immediately able to test the power supply rather than wire it up and find out there was an issue. It looks really good as well, the orange on black scheme, the matte black finish. It looks like a high end power supply. It's installed and working great, no noise from the fan at all. I have a few more systems to build and I will definitely be looking at more of Aresgame's products.",

                "reviewText": "Very impressed with the 'out of the box' look and experience.I purchased the value option AGV500 because it was all I needed for a fun, simple build.Packaging is solid, engaging and detailed with picture of the actual model, Plus 80 Bronze badge including model detail.Inside was stellar....a 'life jacket' wrap to protect the PSU, reusable bags for screws, ties and instructions. 5 stars right away for the quick installation tool that I used to test the unit before assembly.The unit itself is on the smaller side, so installation into a shrouded build will be simple; all cables are a nice stealthy braided black making cable management easier and with the ARESGAME branding present but not overdone, this makes for a very attractive unit imo.On startup, things went beautifully with a quiet running cooling fan purring from the first power up.I had not heard of this brand in Canada but a YouTube channel made me aware of them and I am looking at a couple of other builds to use the slightly beefier 650 & 750 watt units.So far, for $55 CDN ($40 USA) all in, delivered, I am very pleased and look forward to other projects with these units onboard.Cheers!",

Including zip ties, quick tester, great documentation, screws all the stuff you need.If you don't need a modular power supply like my self and want to safe some money, this is 100% worth the try.I could not have asked for more for the price and AresGame has over delivered with this product.
