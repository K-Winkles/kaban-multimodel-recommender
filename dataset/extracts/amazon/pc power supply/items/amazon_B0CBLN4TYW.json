The fan is reasonably quiet and I appreciate the lack of Molex connectors on the actual cables, though there's a SATA to Molex adapter if you really need it. I would have liked some braided sleeves over the cables for aesthetic reasons and for the price I don't think that's a big ask. Time will tell how long it holds up.",

Its nice that they included a sata to molex adapter instead of having molex connectors built in. IMO, not many people need the molex anymore so its good they focused on the Sata power instead. Has 2 GPU pcie cables which both have 2 sets of connectors each. Could use one more CPU connector. Overall a very nice PSU",
