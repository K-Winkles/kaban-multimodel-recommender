Wish they included more cable combs. Only comes with 4, one for each of the cable. They come preinstalled and are hard to remove. I couldn't figure it out and gave up trying. Cables are pretty stiff, so it was hard to bend them to connect to the motherboard. They do have inline capacitor with heatshrink located in the middle of the cable so you can hide them in the back of the case unlike the original cables that came with psu. I would check the compatibility list to make sure these work with your psu.",

After troubleshooting my system I started pulling wires and compared my original 24 pin to the New Sleeved 24 pin and that's when I noticed the missing pin.I ended up using the other cables in the kit because I did need them, and they feel good and look good, however I really wanted that 24 pin in the build, so, sad face. Corsair should be specific on which power supplies these cables will work on vs which are not compatible, so minus one star corsair.",
