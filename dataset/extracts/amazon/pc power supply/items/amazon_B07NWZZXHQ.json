                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars It's an Andyson OEM model. Not a Young Year OEM. Quality is solid now.",
                "reviewText": "I think that this could be a terrific bargain - due to two major reasons. Apevia (formerly Aspire) is still trying to \"fix\" an image that rightfully came from selling really bad power supplies in the early 2000's. And, this was largely the result of using Young Year as their primary OEM, a Taiwanese manufacturer that built some of the most inferior PSUs made and mislabeling them with false specifications.Almost every major PSU brand uses an OEM. Most don\u2019t actually manufacture power supplies, they use an OEM manufacturer. Apevia now uses a reputable and above average manufacturer now. Andyson is not as well known as some of the more prestigious OEMs like Seasonic or FSP - but they have a solid reputation. When you look at legit and credible reviews of their H6 800W (AD-800GGF) power supply (which coincidentally share the same model number) such as Johnny Guru and others online, its been noted for its excellent voltage stability, very good to excellent ripple control and nice looking power on transient results. Personally, I think it's the same exact unit - only relabeled. The only knocks are the lack of modular cables. The build is solid. \"Electrolytics are mostly the good stuff with most of them Chemi-Con or Nichicon.\" A retail Andyson 800w Gold PSU sells for over a $100. But the company is not well known and still struggling for market share. So this is why Apevia with the market power is rebranding them.You will notice that major builders, including Cyber Power, are using Apevia power supplies in their gaming systems. They're not doing this without a lot of thought. Andyson OEMs, rebranded as Apevia PSUs, are solid, well priced power supplies built well with reputable credentials. At low prices two to three times less the other good OEMs.I will update this review - when the power supply arrives. I am replacing a 600w Thermaltake PSU in my 11 year old's computer. He has an AMD 1600 (really a 2600) which i bought here on Amazon on an MSI 450B motherboard as well as a PowerColor Red Devil RX 580. Since I am OC', both are pretty power hungry. This PSU one carries a 3 year warranty - which isn't too bad. And using it's old history against them. Hope this helps everyone and let everyone get a fair review of this PSU. I'll post again once i install the PSU.Update: It arrived last week. My son, an avid gamer - has played on his esports rig all weekend. Not one hiccup. Build is solid and the fan is better than expected. Have not had any problems. I'm not going to compare the heft of this PSU to my 1600W but its seems very solid. No modular cables but everything is sleeved. And surprisingly, it has a controlled fan - which I didn't expect. Very quiet. More than I expected. Overall, I'm giving this a 4 for build and use and a 5 for value. Seriously, I think I got an 800W Gold Certified PSU by Andyson for $70. That is a bargain.Just an important note: Please remember that PSU's are hit or miss. I can't verify the QC but overall, Andyson's QC is much better than most. I got a good one. Most have according to the review stars. YMMV.",

                "reviewText": "Just got it installed and wired. I bought this one because it has four PCIe plugs, seven SATA connections, even has 3 old school IDE connectors. The cabling is wrapped nicely in black mesh, which I didn't expect from a budget unit. It isn't modular, but the wiring is more than long enough for my mid ATX tower. Some ppl said the wiring is too short?? I have a mid tower and I had to curl amd toe back most of it. I guess maybe a full size tower would need creative routing and component placement, but the wiring on this unit is a little longer than standard. I've built many systems- some mine and quite a few for friends and such. These are standard length if not a bit longer. It's hard to find a PSU with more than 4 or 5 SATA connectors for less than 100$. This has 7. I have 5 HDD and 2 DVD writers so I need at least 7 without a hub. I can't hear ot at all. I only hear my case fans and the CPU fan. So far, I'm very happy with it. It is puttimg out nominally about 550W but specs say it can peak short bursts of over 850. IDK about that, I've icky had it for a few hours. Very happy with this purchase. Price is phenomenal for 800W with this many connectors.",

                "reviewText": "I was really hopeful when buying from Apevia, since I believe they've turned the tide on their product quality and are now a brand worth buying from. And for the most part I can confirm that they do produce quality products now. However, there's just one problem I have with this 800W Gold power supply. The noise. The fan used to cool this PSU runs constantly, and sounds like a very muffled little engine just put-putting along in there. Since the rest of my PC is virtually silent, the noise from the PSU fan is very prominent. Gaming sounds fine, since the rest of my PC spins up anyway, but while editing photos and doing homework, this thing gets really irritating. I just can't keep a PSU in my PC that sounds like this constantly. Otherwise, if you already have noisy components in your PC, like an AIO pump or fans that stay on, then go for it. You can't beat this wattage and efficiency rating for the price.",
