                "reviewText": "When the power supply on our legacy DOS box gave up recently, we were wondering if it's still even possible to get a brand new power supply which is compatible with the older ports on an ATX computer tower. After finding this for a very reasonable price, I'm happy we took a chance because it paid off! Here's some specific observations:Pros:Delivers 400W of solid power, more than enough for most PCsCertified efficient, resulting in less excess heat and (hopefully) lower electricity billsName brand - backed by support and warranty for peace of mindCons:Lacks some premium features like modular or wrapped cablesDoes not include super long cables, so best for a mid-size towerSo far, this has exceeded my expectations. While it doesn't have every bell and whistle, it nails the basics with reliable power and efficiency. Given the more than reasonable price point, solid performance, and support, it hits a sweet spot that offers great value. If you need a quality PSU that won't break the bank, especially for a legacy computer tower, the Coolmax I-400 is a great option!",

                "reviewText": "Needed something to revive an old Optiplex. Used Dell PSUs were more expensive whereas you could get this new for $20 with free Prime shipping. So of course I went with this.There are things to like about it. Namely, it works. And that's about it.But if you will, let me go off about this specific PSU.For starters, it's crazy seeing through-hole components used throughout the PSU. Absolutely no SMDs. This is like an early 2000's design but being sold as completely new in the 2020's. I didn't go as deep but I have a feeling everything on the board was hand-soldered. Heck, you still need to select the input voltage on the back still. Pretty old-school.The heatsinks for the MOSFETs might as well be stamped out of aluminum soda cans, that's how thin they are. I'm surprised they can dissipate heat well enough for this PSU's 400W rating, which leads me to my next point.This PSU is rated for 400W of output, 300W of which is for the +12V rail. The sticker on the side of the PSU rates the input as 12A at 115V. What that means is at full tilt, the PSU needs 1380W! That's absolutely insane! While I dare not want to find out if that's true, I have a feeling the paltry heatsinks I mentioned would probably be melting at that point, even with the 80 mm fan in the PSU. Speaking of which...On the box, the fan is mentioned as a \"80mm silent design\" which is honestly laughable. The fan itself has no label or identification marks at all, and the quality of it sets the lowest bar of what could be considered a \"fan\". It operates at only a single speed: loud. But it definitely needs a fan because, well...The efficiency is pretty low. While not a scientific test, I compared this PSU to another PSU with a known efficiency curve and placed it in an identical system. From my own calculations, this PSU struggles to hit 75% efficiency and it only drops from there (hopefully not to the 29% you can calculate from above). You can tell this PSU gets warm after decent use.The wires are unsubstantial and thin, but they do connect things. Makes it pretty easy to cable manage actually so that's a small plus.Finally, the casing. I think those metal tin cans that grandma's cookies come in are thicker than what encloses all these angry pixies. No, scratch that, these are sad pixies because I know I'd be one if I had the misfortune of being routed through this box.But as much as I rag on this PSU, for $20, it does the job. And if you find yourself needing a new PSU but want to put the least amount of investment into it, well, here you go.4 stars.",

                "reviewText": "I had an older computer that I was given because it was not working. Pushing the power button, nothing happened. No fan came on does not necessarily mean the PSU (Power Supply Unit) was bad but since the computer did not power on, that in itself made me feel that it was very likely a bad PSU. This PSU cost cheap enough that if it was not a bad PSU in the computer, then I wouldn't be out of that much money (and I could use it somewhere else later on). After installing the PSU, I unhooked the old PSU one cord at a time while plugging in the new one one cord at a time to be sure all connections were correct (I found out one new connection had a double connector that was able to be separated, which was what I needed).After placing the PSU in the computer and screwing it down, plugging it in to the power cord then pressing the computer power button, the computer powered up and now works just fine!The fan in the PSU is fairly quiet and only comes on when either the temperature gets high enough to need it or when more load is being needed (load means a lot of computations [a lot of programs going at once or one program requiring the computer to work harder] being done).I am greatly pleased with my purchase of this unit and I will definitely be buying more in the near future!",

                "reviewText": "This power supply operated the computer fine. The problem was that it introduced RFI ( Radio Frequency Interference ) into my radio communication equipment. I seriously doubt that it meets the ATX EMI specification. I know that it caused seriously interfering noise in the radio from the 3 - 4 Mhz. The original computer ( HP ) power supply caused no such interference. I noticed that when I received this power supply that it was considerably lighter than the HP power supply. This probably indicates that proper filtering was eliminated to save cost.",

                "reviewText": "Bought this to replace an FSP 300W model 60THA. I was skeptical but decided to take a chance given the very low price.Pleased to see it had exactly the same 24 pin connector for the motherboard with all the same color (voltage) wires as the FSP from my Acer TC780. The 4 pin connector for the board was slightly confusing as it appeared to be an 8 pin connector instead. That may be the reason this is described as a 12 volt supply. Ignore that description. The 8 pin connector is actually TWO connectors side by side. I only needed half of that and they were easily separated and had the correct yellow and black wires. The other connectors for my two hard drives are standard.Yes, the fan makes a little noise, but I had a Dell computer in the 90s that made 3 times as much noise.Overall, great value for the money and happy to have my computer running again.",
