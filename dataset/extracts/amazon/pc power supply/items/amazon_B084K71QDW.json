                "reviewText": "I was replacing a Gamdias Kratos 550B from a Skytech gaming PC; my biggest problem aside from not knowing all the standards was the size of the PSU. Many of the other units were physically larger so I played it safe and went with the same brand/size. My hard drive is located in front of the PSU and it's very tight. I'm hoping the jump to the 750G will give me headroom and not stress out the unit; the 550B had about 100 hours before dying. This one has been install for a few week and has about 20hrs. It's quiet enough when you don't flip the switch to 100% fan (then you can't hear yourself think.)",

I assembled my my new computer and turned it and the LEDs it had were quite nice and there were no issues initially. Also, make sure you switch the PSU to silent mode on the back as it is quite noisy in standard mode. I tried a game out with my new graphics card and it was drawing 200w+ from the power supply and then an awful buzzing noise started, so I ended up returning this power supply. If you are lucky and get a good one you should be fine or if you have a low power requirement for you video card you should be fine.",
