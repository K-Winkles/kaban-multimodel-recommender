Launched in May 2014, the EVGA Supernova G1power supplies have been among the longest-lasting and best-performing power supplies on the market. Despite only a few changes over the years, it's only fitting that these are due for an upgrade. Enter the G1+, the new and improved fully-modular power supply line-up from EVGA with an 80+ Gold Efficiency rating. Compared to the EVGA Supernova G1 power supplies, the G1+ are up to 20mm shorter, feature 100%Japanese capacitors, are up to 20% quieter, have much tighter 12v. load regulation, and have a superior fluid-dynamic bearing fan. Combining a full set of current, voltage, and temperature protections with EVGA's World Leading 10-Year , the EVGA Supernova G1+ power supplies set the new Gold standard for performance and value. Operating Temperature = 0 Degrees Celsius to 50 Degrees Celsius.",

I used this in a Fractal microATX case with fairly low margins and it fit absolutely perfect.There's basically two brands that I like when it comes to power supplies: Seasonic and EVGA. Both make absolutely rock solid PSUs that are worth the slight premium. I have literally never had an EVGA power supply fail. However, they have the absolutely best customer support even when you do have an issue. They are one of the best companies in terms of customer-friendly policies and very quick on any RMA or repair needs.",

                "reviewText": "I'm using a couple of these to power some ASIC crypto miners (2 Mini DOGE and 2 Futurebit BTC). They're basically silent, efficient, and have a 10 year warranty. The cable kit they come with is massive overkill for my use case, but it will be good to have should I decide to consolidate into a larger PSU and sell the 2 650 Watt units or use them in a PC build.Be sure to register your units with EVGA for warranty coverage and to raise your status with them if you're interested in PC components.",
