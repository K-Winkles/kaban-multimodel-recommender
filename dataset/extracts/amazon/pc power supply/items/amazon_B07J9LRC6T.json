            "The LCD power tester is a powerful power test device. This power tester only needs to be connected to the ATX connector of the power supply to easily and intuitively know whether the output of each power supply is normal. It can detect ATX, BTX, ITX, TFX computer power supply, and can display various voltage and PG values in liquid crystal to quickly detect the performance of computer power supply.",
            "The LCD displays various parameters such as output voltage and PG. When each parameter exceeds the normal value, the buzzer will sound a warning and the corresponding value will flash.",
            "It can measure the voltage of each group of power supply 3.3V/+5V/+12V/-12V/SB+5V/PG, and also measure the output wire P4/P6/P8/SATA/IDE, external DIE/SATA/P6/P8 is the light Displayed, there is no LCD voltage. Only the 24pin or 20pin will have the LCD voltage.",
            "It has LCD intuitive and accurate display voltage (+/-0.01V), automatic fault alarm, complete test interface, small and beautiful appearance, and many test functions. It is the best choice for quickly detecting PC power.",
            "Support 20Pin, 24Pin ATX interface / SATA interface / 4Pin, 8Pin interface / PCI-E graphics card 6Pin interface / floppy drive interface / ATE hard disk interface."

        "description": "Specifications: Material: plastic + aluminum alloy Size: 126x64x18.5mm/4.95x2.51x0.72inch Weight: 120g Operation method: A. Plug the power supply 20PIN or 24PIN and P4, P6 or P8 into the corresponding position of the power tester. (If you plug in the 20PIN or 24PIN interface tester alarm and display LL, you need to plug in 4P! Please look for 4P must be inserted in the 4P position!) B. Turn on the power and \u201cdrip\u201d sounds two sounds. If the values of each group are not flashing, it means that the power input is normal. C. If a circuit voltage signal is not detected (such as a 20PIN or 24PIN connector) or the detected voltage is out of the normal range, the buzzer will sound a \"drip\" warning for a long time, and the corresponding voltage or PG value will be displayed. If the status is flashing, it means the power supply is faulty! Note: The +3.3V light plugged into the SATA interface tester is not lit because the power SATA interface has 4 wires and 5 wires. First, make sure that your power SATA interface is 4 wires or 5 wires. If it is 4 Line, that is no +3.3V output, only 5 lines have +3.3V output. We highly appreciate all customers opinions to improve the selling, also if anything you unsatisfied, please contact us for probable best solution. Package Includes: 1Pcs",

It does the job - the connections are straight forward, the display is easy to read, and there's an audible beep if something is wrong.It's a little unintuitive. There are three LEDs, one for each voltage, but these *only* light up if a Molex (12V/5V) or SATA (12V/5V/3.3V) cable is connected. It will also beep if the \"power supply good\" (PGS) signal is close to 100 ms, even though 100 - 500 ms is a valid signal. And since many modern supplies self-test faster, that may give you a false negative.Mine also arrived with the display scratched out of the package. Not great, but it doesn't affect the functionality.On the whole, it does what it needs to do. The power supply I needed to test ws fine, and I was able to reassemble the PC without issue.",

It is unclear how to read the power connectors other than the 24pin one, but it seems to just show LEDs indicating the presence of the different voltage lines (it doesn't read the actual voltage like it does for the 24pin connector), and there is probably supposed to be a caveat (in the non-existent instructions) that you must test one such connector at a time.
