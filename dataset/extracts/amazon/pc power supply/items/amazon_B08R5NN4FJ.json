Just 30 days after the date of purchase and installation the bearing in the fan started leaking which caused an internal short with shorted out the unit. After replacing the unit with another from the manufacturer under the one year warranty, the second unit kept powering down my computer for unknown reasons. Upon further investigation I found a power wire had pulled out of the sata connector for the hard drive which was causing blue screens and shutting down the computer improperly. Save yourself the time and buy a power supply from a known manufacturer with a good warranty. This is not the unit that I would recommend to anybody.",

All the other SFX-l with 120mm fans are quieter but cost over 120$. It would be just fine for a gaming rig but I wanted a silent PlexServer. I installed it on a Jonsbo N2 and I replaced the fan with a \"Cooler Master Sleeve Bearing 80mm Silent Fan\" ($9.99) and it's now almost silent. ( THIS WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY BOYS AND GIRLS... DO NOT DO WHAT I DID ) Overall if you do not need a silent PC this is a bargain SFX psu. If you need a for a PlexServer or are going to sleep next to it.... swap the fan and it is nearly silent. ( you will still hear your other fans running and HD's spinning) Good luck",

                "reviewText": "I prefer to build ITX pc systems, so I am always looking for a good value power supply. While Apevia does make some rather cheap products, their power supplies have always been a good buy for me. I was putting together a system with an Intel i7-7700k, Nvidia GTX 1080 and all sorts of fancy rgb so I was looking for a power supply that could handle that at a decent price. I have 3 of these currently running systems with no issues. After overclocking and stress testing I saw a max power draw of 483 watts and the power supply handled it with no issues whatsoever. If you're looking for a good quality psu you really can't go wrong with this one.",

I adapted it to fit by using one screw hole in the bottom and drilling a couple holes on top and a 1.25\" hole to fit the switch with a Multi Size Hole Stepped Up Unibit. Also needed a 24 to 6 pin adapter. Working good. I recommend getting the higher wattage, if you need 400watts get a 500 and so on...",
