After months of use the system with this adapter is still working perfectly and reliably. I can definitely recommend this for anyone needing to adapt a standard ATX power supply to the proprietary HP connector.",

The wires seem like they are a gauge larger than what is strictly necessary and fit and finish of the connectors are very good.",
