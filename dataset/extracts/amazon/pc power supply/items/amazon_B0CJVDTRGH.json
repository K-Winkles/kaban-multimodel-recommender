The power supply wires have a braided fabric sleeve till about 3 inches from the plug. This it has a zip tie that is shrink wrapped than about an inch of shinny coated plastic wires. With these extensions each wire is fabric covered all the way to the plug with wire combs keeping them with a clean appearance. Its not much of a change but does improve its appearance. At the same time depending upon your computer case the space behind could be limited for longer wires along with the connectors. My case is a Be Quiet DX500 and it is very snug in the back with the added wires.",
