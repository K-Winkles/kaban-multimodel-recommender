When each parameter exceeds the normal value, the buzzer will sound a warning sound, and the corresponding value will flash. PG automatically alarms, and the LCD displays the voltage of each volt. The LCD power tester is a powerful power test device. This power tester only needs to be connected to the ATX connector of the power supply to easily and intuitively know whether the output of each power supply is normal. It can detect ATX, BTX, ITX, TFX computer power supply, and can display various voltage and PG values in LCD screen to quickly detect the performance of computer power supply.
