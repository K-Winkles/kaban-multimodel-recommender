It also uses Active PFC, with a 99% factor correction, boosting performance and saving energy. No toggle switch included, the power supply automatically switches between 110V and 240V depending on the power grid its attached to. 80+ Bronze certified. For safety, do not overload, abuse or modify the power supply unit. Use of this unit for Bitcoin Mining is not suggested since it will shorten the life and cause failures of power supply.

                "reviewText": "I juggled the option of buying my first Apevia PSU some months ago because there were reviews that depicted them as fire hazards, but after running three (now) for weeks at a time without issue, I believe many of the poor reviews on Apevia PSUs to be user error (and some freak occurrences.) I've been confident enough in the models I have to invalidate the warranties just to disconnect the LED lights (I wish manufacturers would add an on/off switch.) The fans run quietly, and the output is stable if you aren't overloading the supply.You DO need to keep in mind that there are only 2 PCI-E outputs (1 hard-wired, one modular.) Depending on your graphics card(s) you need to be mindful of how you connect the cables or you'll run the risk of melting wires. The chances of overloading other connectors is slim, unless you like extreme overclocking (in which case I would definitely NOT recommend using an Apevia PSU;) these are consumer level units, rather than enthusiast.",

Finally it occurred to me to measure power output and sure enough - hardly 500W.I have returned both in the same box I have received them. Seller says that got only one. Thankfully it is easy to prove just by package weight and I am sure Amazon will figure it out, but the persistent desire to somehow defraud customers deserves attention",
