                "reviewText": "The power supply fan in my home server was getting noisy -- a four-year-old Corsair 600 watt unit. Yeah, I probably could have just popped it open and replaced the fan, but I didn't like the technicolor LEDs built into it, and the power cables, although wrapped, were all hard wired.Searching locally and Amazon, I found this CX750-M that's \"semi-modular\" -- means the two cables you MUST use are hard wired, and all the other cables (drives, GPU, extra CPU) are plug-or-not.Took me about 20 minutes to install and route the one additional cable I needed (SATA power to the drives) and I booted it back up to hear... almost nothing. Blessed silence once again.TL;DR: It went in, and it works, almost completely silent.",
