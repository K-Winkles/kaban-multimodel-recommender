                "reviewText": "Item was packaged simply, with an additional velcro orange cable tidy.However, I ran these cables to my power supply and found that my computer would not boot. There was some signs of life, as the LED's on my RAM were lit but the fans etc but the motherboard would not go through the POST boot cycle.I replaced the cables with the originally supplied ones from Corsair and the PC booted fine. These may be compatible with a GPU, though I didn't try after my initial experience.Its worth noting that certain Corsair Power Supplies would not be compatible with these cables as they've started to implement a smaller plug on the power-supply side of the cable.",
