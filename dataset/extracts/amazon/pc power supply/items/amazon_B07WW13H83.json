            "WITH LED DISPLAY: We have developed a portable computer power tester for the power supply market that can judge the quality of the power supply. It has LCD display intuitive and accurate display voltage (+/ 0.01V), automatic fault alarm, complete test interface, small and beautiful appearance, and more test functions. It is your best choice and reliable helper to quickly detect PC power.",
            "EASY TO USE: This power tester only needs to be connected to the power supply ATX connector to easily and intuitively know whether the output of each power supply is normal. It can detect ATX, BTX, ITX, TFX computer power supply, and can display various voltage and PG values in LCD screen to quickly detect the performance of computer power supply.",
            "PRACTICAL & CONVENIENCE: Small and practical power tester. Now the number of power output groups is increasing. As long as one of them has problem, the hardware of the computer system may work abnormally or even burn out. To measure whether the output voltage output of the power supply is stable, the player usually uses a multimeter. But for the average user is still a little troublesome.",
            "NOTE: It can also measure the output wire P4/P6/P8/SATA/IDE, and the external DIE/SATA/P6/P8 is the light display, there is no LCD voltage. There is LCD voltage display only when connecting to the 24pin or 20pin."
