I installed this power supply properly, and was impressed with its silence and ability to support me playing Borderlands 3 on ultra graphics settings with my RTX 3060. This does not draw over 1000 watts with one graphics card however, so there should not be a failure there, and there actually wasn't. Not then at least. Inside the power supply, a capacitor failed while the computer was actually off, which was when I was at work. Very strange for that to happen under no load, but I'm glad my computer was off at the time. There clearly was a defect with mine, and I'm not very upset about it either because nothing very bad happened and my house didn't burn down or anything, but you should ask yourself, - \"How many of these units share this problem?\" before you buy this device. I shined a flashlight inside of it to see a lot of melted black plastic all over the inside, and the cause was a large black ceramic capacitor that malfunctioned and pretty much exploded all over the inside. Internal soldering was sloppy and did not look like enough care went into the production of my individual unit. I do not recommend gambling with your house, especially while you are away from your house. I do not recommend this product unless something drastically changes with Aresgame. My computer does not draw that much wattage. Thank you for reading.",

Sadly, my gaming pc required a six-pin adaptor not the ATX common 24. I can't even come close to the quality and price this came in at and only the unknown of a working adaptor had me send it back. My gaming pc is an Acer and never expected a customer to upgrade. The PSU fit 100% and looked very well built. I wish it had the six-pin main board adaptor but it is not the power supply company's fault for pc builders poor design and wanting to sell you a new computer over upgrading which most of us gamers enjoy doing.",

I did send them one .. after looking for their after sales e-mails for 2 hours (they ask for 1 e-mail but never gave said e-mail) Been over 1 week without any replies from Ares game store. Ended up installing my Thermaltake PSU dated from 2013 BUT at least it is not buzzing like crazzy. Thanks to Amazon after sales they allowed me to return it and refund. Never again ill buy any ares product.. they are cheap in price but also cheap in quality and after sales rep sucked! This crappy PSU could have friend my bran new PC Ryzen 9 5950x with x570 tug gaming MB. Never trust this company with your 5k + rig!!!!",
