It shines brilliantly on the sharp and sleek panel. And most importantly, it just works. It handles the heavy power requirements of my AMD 7900x Processor and AMD6900XT AIO GPU.In the realm of power supplies, the ASUS Rog Thor 1200 shines as a reliable powerhouse that's got your back, no questions asked.",

                "reviewText": "To start off. The pictures do not do this beastly thing justice. The shell ROG chose to use is really aesthetically pleasing and feels thicker and more solid than 99% of the power supplies I\u2019ve touched (veteran pc repair shop tech) and the cables that they included that were braided bend really well, and look good when combed with the combs they come with. I use this in my main test bench pc for like gpu testing cpu testing motherboard testing because having the wattage readout has came in WAY handier than you would think as a repairman. I can tell if parts aren\u2019t working correctly just based on there power draw. Sounds crazy but when you\u2019ve seen what I\u2019ve seen it\u2019s one less thing I have to worry about having on hand when it\u2019s literally built into my bench. But I was building and testing with a 7950x and a 4090, and me and the boss were skeptical, but this psu powered both, it probably could do this for a while but I do not recommend this for that. My modest 5700x with a 6950xt will happily sit right dead at 50% load on this thing when gaming heavy titles. Which is where this thing GLEAMS. 92.6 percent efficient, just a note, that\u2019s almost in titanium efficiency territory. Damn fine work ROG. Had one at the shop so I bought a second for my rig lol. Do not buy if the price isn\u2019t sub 150 i say as seasonic offers some for cheaper than that. And this is just a heavily modded seasonic power supply.",

                "reviewText": "This power supply has very responsive RGBA lights. The RGB cord is included but I suggest to connect the cord before you install it of course you don't need to plug it in but if you don't plug in the RGB cord it will constantly be red, although I have quite articulating fingers it was extremely hard to plug in. The cables that came with this power supply do not feel extremely high quality unlike the power supply itself, the cords also do not bend that much but they look pretty good. I previously bought a 50$ power supply that didn't work for my motherboard that supports a core i7 10 to 11 gen. This power supply comes with stuff to organize your cables and all the cables are included also the hard drive power cable is the same as the fan power cable. My conclusion is if you want a power supply for your PC so you can play Roblox then get this.",

                "reviewText": "1200W may be an overkill (especially for RTX 3080/3090), but I felt the need to \"future proof\" my PSU for future parts. Was browsing and came across this beat looking PSU which fits perfectly on my custom ASUS PC And overall i'm very happy with it.The PSU........-Feels very premium (Box is well secured)-comes with custom sleeve cables-Come with connectors and zip pins so you can organised your cables-Cool looking sticker (if that even matters to you hahaha)-Helpful OLED panel that shows how much wattage's you are using. Been seeing many people concerned on howmany watts they are using or need for the RTX 3000 cards yet I can simply look at my PC to see my numbers haha.-Awesome design and love the RGB. Unfortunately I can't customize the colors directly for some odd reason yet since I have other ASUS parts that are compatible with custom RGB (MB, CPU cooler, etc) I was able to change the PSU RGB colors when I changed my motherboards RGB colors. So I guess that's how it works.Kinda interesting that with a 3950x and 2080s (no overclocking), on 1440p ultrawide max settings gaming, I was using around 300 watts in total. Kinda gave me 2nd thoughts if this was an overkill but at the same time, it's nice to future proof your PSU and not being able to worry about upgrading in the future especially when it comes to PSU shortages. Overall great PSU, may be a bit expensive, but I feel this PSU is meant for custom PC builds.",
