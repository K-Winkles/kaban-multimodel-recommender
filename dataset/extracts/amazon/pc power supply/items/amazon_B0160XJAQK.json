I got six years of 24/7 use out of the previous EVGA power supply. Couple of minor changes over the past six years. All the wiring is now black. It certainly was not necessary to have the colors, and the black blends in nicely for those of you with lights inside your computer and windows to look. The connectors with fewer conductors are now a ribbon cable, all black. The cable for the mother board is made up of individual cables, and is sleeved. EVGA is a good manufacturer, and I was pleased to order another after years of good service. And the price is very reasonable. The PC power supply I bought, 15 years ago, was $35. I was expecting a hundred or more, but EVGA isn't gouging, and I appreciate that.",

                "reviewText": "Great working unit! It arrived in one day and slotted in to my PC Build from 2017. Computer powered on and fixed my problem. Couldn't be happier! Since my system is older, the older molex connectors came in handy to power the RGB Fans. That was a nice touch. This system is not a power house, but it will allow me to upgrade my graphics card with an 8 pin power card. Plenty of power to run my system as it is. Probably last another 5 years which is fine by me.Here's the story: 2 weeks ago we had a pretty bad storm and I heard thunder and lightning all night. The next day I was using my desktop computer and all of the sudden it shut itself off. I had to reset the power supply switch before the computer would turn back on. The computer booted and I resumed working. The same thing happened for the next 2 weeks, at least every day or two. Then yesterday I went to start it and the computer wouldn't even power on. I suspected the power supply was the issue. Since replacing it's all back to good, so far! :D",

Honestly, I didn\u2019t find any advantage or disadvantage of it.The only remaining question is this PSU durability. My previous ULTRA served on desktop PC with the liquid cooler for about 7 years.Will EVGA be able to work the same long or longer? To be seen.",

                "reviewText": "Fast/easy install, but then again this isn't my first rodeo.Upgraded the wife's GPU, which in turn required a beefier PSU, so here we are. The install went flawlessly and cables although stiff, were easy to manage/tie up. Would have been nice to have modular plugs for a cleaner install but at this price, beggars can't be choosers. There was more than the required power options, with spare CPU and SATA power cables to be tied up.Overall, a great sturdy and trustworthy product so far. Expect no less from EVGA, to be honest.",
