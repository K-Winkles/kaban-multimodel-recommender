I have eight systems builtOver time the entire room smells like a computer with traditional power supplies. PCB paste is a known cancer causing agent thus all the warning signs you see at various electronic and other storesThus far all if the units work fine ... I've used five different brandsRGeek and mini seem to be popularMy one concern is the power cable which has the power transformer encapsulated (looks like a laptop power cable with a larger power module) can get hot if I do intense things like cloning a hard drive with a lot of data on it ...I would test various power cables and go larger wattage than you think you need ... not overkillNormally the cables dont get hot at allThe Mini brand offers both adapter and compatable power cablePS ... the fellow with all the issues must be doing something wrongAs a comparison guide my systems are various i7 boards with mid range Zotac video cards ... I even have an older 20 pin P3 board running off a PICOIf you want to run an eight pin cpu board use the eight pin 450 or 500 watt adapter at Ali Express site ... the fellow selling them here has jacked the price almost double ... I don't mind a small profit of $10 more per unit to $35 to avoid buying from the China site but $25 more for a $29 part is too much ... they are $50 plus dollars here on Amazon which is a ripThis unit is a good one ... mine works perfectHope this helps",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. I am using it for crypto mining, i am currently powering 5 CPU Mining rig using this. One thing I didn\u2019t feel comfortable, the original 12v input wire to the board were too thin, it was getting too hot for my liking, fire hazard. The original wire, copper gauge was 24 AWG (3rd image, 2 red and 2 blk wire connector, is the original) and I upgraded them to 16 AWG (new connector that is on the pico board, red, white, green and black wire). 2-3 wires of the original is equal to one of the 16AWG wire I replaced. Now works perfect. Powering all of them with a Server PSU and a breakout board(SEE VIDEO).",

                "reviewText": "This was my first experience with ITX builds, and one thing I'd heard a lot for extra small ITX builds is pico/DC-DC power supplies. I used the 240w LEDWholesalers brick which was recommended by many, and it worked fine. I was blown away at how affordable and compact this whole setup was.Of course, there was a catch. The DC connector where the brick plugs into gets incredibly hot under load, and the cables running after the power brick, especially the PSU side get hot too. My system (RTX A2000, i5 12400) uses 150W maximum sustained load. Talked to my electrical engineer friend and he said the wires off the connector (18AWG as labeled) could be under-specced, as could the connector itself. After tearing into the connector, the solder joints actually looked half decent, but it's clear the jack and wires weren't.I don't want to throw things like \"Fire hazard\" around without good reason, especially when lots of other reviewers had good anecdotes with this unit and it could be due to unfortunate circumstances on my end. As noted by other reviewers though, the wiring was too thin and had to be replaced, and a review on the LEDWholesalers brick said the wiring AND jack included jack got hot. I'll be returning the power brick, but since I cut this one up in an attempt to fix/replace the power connector, I can't return this.I really don't want to slander what for many people's been the answer they need, and a product in theory I'm a big fan of, but my experience here was concerning to say the least. I ended up going with the HDPlex GaN passive aio supply, which works great, but I was really hoping this would work at 1/4 the price. Gotta say from my experience, proceed with caution.",

(Well there's a very low level ground buzz with my ear within an inch or 2 of the speaker: I can live with that.)I don't know if the other PSU board was defective or simply attaching the ground wire on this one did the trick (the nanu didn't have a ground wire) but I wish I'd tried this before spending a lot of money on less effective isolators etc.Giving 4 stars only because it's new and reliability is not confirmed.Great value.",
