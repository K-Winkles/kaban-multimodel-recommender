                "reviewText": "Let me first start off by saying I\u2019ve been building computers for 2 decades. I have experience with this stuff.One major rule of building? Don\u2019t get a cheap heart. PSU = Heart of your build.Things I consider when buying PSUs? Quality, Longevity, Rating, Noise.You cannot go wrong with EVGA components ever. These is a brand that does NOT cheap out, but in return you pay a premium. Is the premium worth it for all their products? Debatable. Is it worth it for PSUs? 100%.This thing is small (140), packs a punch at 850w, and is rated for 80+ platinum. It\u2019s also fully modular, and is future proofed. It can run modern day cards without needing to daisy chain your PCIE 6+2 cables (comes with 4 cables and has 4 individual PCIE/VGA power slots. Currently running an MSI RTX 4080 Trio X and an i7-12700k and have zero issues.The cables that come with it are high quality and have a decent amount of play, not too stiff, meaning you can run them through your case easily. They are also decently long and gave me zero issues with my Hyte Y60 case.Last plus? No noise. This thing has no noise or that sometimes annoying PSU slight chemical smell.The ONLY thing I will tell you to do, is flip the eco mode button on the back to \u201cOff\u201d. Eco mode isn\u2019t reliable with power management on ANY PSU.Enjoy it. Don\u2019t buy garbage, buy this.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for the 650 Platinum power supply.After the original bronze level EVGA power supply went out after about 4.5 years of continuous 24/7 use in a security camera server, I decide to get something a little more heavy-duty component wise and purchased this platinum level power supply. This power supply is definitely a step up from the previous bronze power supply, which provided 500 watts of continuous power. This one is not only capable of 650 watts but has a much better warranty at 10 years versus 3 for the bronze one.This is a really good quality power supply that feels very solid. Best of all this is a modular power supply making it easier to customize as my previous power supply was not. Included are tons of different cables for most applications as well as a power supply tester. To confirm my paper clip test on my previous power supply, the tester confirmed my previous PS had gone out. The power supply was easy to put into the case and connected easily. It didn\u2019t like some of my cables from another PS that I was using as a temporary unit until I got this one installed and I had to switch to the new ones that came with the PS, but otherwise I had no major issue with the installation. When the PS is powered up the fan is silent and works efficiently. The eco mode (enabled by a switch on the PS) seems to work fine on my camera server and I like the fact that it saves some wear and tear on the PS.So far, no problems with the PS. I think it is a bit expensive, but as long as it lasts through its 10-year warranty, I will be satisfied with it. I will update my review with any long-term durability issues as this will be running continuously for the camera computer server.5 stars",

                "reviewText": "This power supply (850W Plat EVGA) has been fantastic for me. I purchased this Dec. '18, and have since done a major upgrade of my system. This power supply is super quiet. It has an eco mode where you can have the fan shut off completely below a certain power draw, but I've been suspicious of that and haven't used it for any real length of time. Really, there's no point when the PSU is quieter than the system fans. The fully modular cables makes it a breeze to do install. Just be aware which end you're plugging into the PSU, because either end of the modular cables will plug into the PSU, but the plastic retention clip won't fit into the PSU chassis hole if you have them reversed.I've had weaker power supplies in the past that made loud magneto striction noises (buzzing) when the graphics card pulled a heavy load. Also, a bad power supply can cause your system to BSOD, not OC well, etc. With the current gen of graphics coming out (Big Navi and the far more power hungry Nvidia 3000 series), having a good power supply is more important than ever. My system is still running an EVGA1070 FTW2, but I'll be upgrading soon depending on how Big Navi shakes out (this review written 10/27/20). I may come back and update after my graphics update.System specs:AMD 3900X air cooledMSI Gaming Edge WifiGSkill Trident 32GB (2x16) 3600EVGA GeForce 1070 FTW2",

                "reviewText": "I must say, this is an impressive power supply from EVGA backed with their 10 year manufacturer warranty. It's compact and reliable and easy to work with due to the modular nature of it. For comparison, it is also quite the big improvement from the previous generation, the P5, which I've previously owned before which had some troubles with it due to it struggling with consistent power delivery (I would get really weird issues like my video signal cut off with a black screen due to the GPU with the transient spikes). Once I upgraded to the P6, my troubles vanished and I could use my PC without worry.I must mention though, The P6 generation is built by the OEM, Seasonic, which is surprising to be honest but they are reputable with their hardware and specifications. As to the P5, the OEM is FSP, which I found to my research from that PSU they are not that great.I threw some power benchmarks such as OCCT on and see if it holds up to max power, with the context of using an RTX 3080 and R7 5800X3D for many hours. Surprisingly it does hold up stable and no crashing, quite strong. Noise level is pleasant, not distracting. I do suggest keeping ECO Mode switched to OFF for longevity because cooling is necessary.Overall, I feel very happy that this power supply holds up and does the job well, and I certainly will be at ease with EVGA's backed 10 year warranty if this power supply needs it.Definitely would recommend.",
