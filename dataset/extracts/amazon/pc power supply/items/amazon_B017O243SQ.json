At 400W, this provides plenty of power for vintage systems and has a good number of connectors. The power switch cable is a bit shorter than the power supply I replaced, and just barely fits in my mid-tower case. Overall on paper it looks great and I want to love it.However, I\u2019ve gone through two of these power supplies and they are both providing too high of a voltage on both the 5V and 12V rails which will shorten the life of the system - and absolute no for retro system builds. With that in mind I cannot recommend this PSU and have editing my rating down accordingly.",

This power supply is so light weight it feels like it\u2019s empty. The power voltages on 12v and 5v are too high and out of spec. The power on cord with included switch is shorter than every other AT power supply I have ever owned. Over all this is a $12 power supply you would get direct from China, but for a $50 price tag. Disappointed more than anything, as it\u2019s junk\u2026 why are companies building junk in 2022?",
