Just like the seller stated above, the PSU doesn't shut off completely, but all I have to do is flip the switch on the back of the PSU and it cuts power. Small price to pay for the convenience of this helpful cable.",

None of the modular power supplies come with a 10 pin connector so this connector was a life saver. So far with about a month of using it I have had no issue out of it and it doesn't seem to get hot like some people would be concerned with. I will admit I did put the connection point between the 24 pin to the 10 pin connector in the main part of my case so it does get a lot of airflow as I have a very open case with 6 fans. Not sure if that's why it doesn't get hot but seemed worth the slightly less attractive appearance on the cable management side of things.",
