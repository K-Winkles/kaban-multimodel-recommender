                "reviewText": "My first impression upon receiving the Aresgame AGV650 was that the packaging looked good. I've purchased a lot of computer parts and power supplies over the years, and I've had a lot of poorly packaged items arrive. Opening the shipping box and finding a nice, clean looking product box was a nice start. Opening it up, I found that the packaging inside was just as good. I should have taken more pictures! Everything was well organized, separate bags for all the smaller pieces, documentation, information on contacting the manufacturer, etc. Sidenote: I reached out to support with a question and received an extremely fast reply, so that's a great sign with regards to the product as well.Perhaps my favorite little item was the included \"Quick Inspection Tool\", and warning/suggestion that the purchaser use the tool before plugging the power supply into their computer. I have tested a lot of power supplies over the years, often by using a wire or the 'paper clip method' to jumper the positions together on the ATX plug. Having a handy little pre-made jumper tool to do the test is great. Perhaps these are common these days, but I didn't have one, so it was immediately added to my tool box. Thank you Aresgame!The power supply itself looks good. Simple, well made, didn't feel flimsy or cheap. I tested it before plugging it in, and everything looked great. I hooked it up, and it's been working very well. No issues so far, and it's quiet. I installed it in my gaming rig, and it's done a great job handling everything so far.All in all, a great product at a reasonable price. If I have any issues down the road, I'll revisit this review, but all signs point to this being a great purchase. I recommend everyone check out Aresgame products.",

                "reviewText": "Well I was a bit concerned as im not familiar with this new brand beyond what reviews and specs ive read, but between reviews and YT videos I could not shake the feeling this company is making a solid effort at selling a good quality product for a fair price. To be fair its only been running a short time, but the fan is quiet and using a flashlight to look inside it looks like very good build quality and not sloppily assembled, overall im very impressed inside and out. For what youre getting its a bargain especially since some of the name brands in this price range are known to be sketchy and frankly this Aresgame looks and feels better than some of those and at a better price. If it continues to operate as it is now Ill be very impressed and tempted to buy another one just to have for any future builds. As of right now this is my favorite power supply brand, I was going to say \"budget\" but really nothing about it feels low budget - it feels like good quality through and through, well put together and there appears to be no coil whine so far. Obviously I cannot comment on longevity, but so far I think the Aersgame brand is an up and coming winner.--->>> 1 MONTH UPDATE: Well this PS has been running for a month now in my mcroATX case and its still showing totally stable voltages in Hardware info software, its so quiet you dont even know its in there and now my only regret is not getting the 750 watt version for its modular cables in my micro ATX case. Dont get me wrong, ive worked in factories and you can get a defective unit in any brand, I see it in major brands all the time -- but comparing major brands to this brand I dont see any higher defect rate in fact given the number sold here i'd say its defect rate is even lower than some name brands for the number of units sold and I was looking at some other known brands and seeing more than an acceptable number of defects and these were not cheap brands - in the end I kept coming back to the Aresgame brand because they simply had a lower defect rate and 4.5 - 5 star reviews. If Aresgame keeps their quality up and prices reasonable they should become a major player in a market where availability of computer parts is sometimes sporadic and quality is often not what it should be or what it once was for some brands that frankly seem overpriced and are now trading on their name and past reputation more so than their once good but now declining build quality. Keep up the good work Aresgame, dont get sloppy and greedy and mess it up.",

This is probably one of the purchases I've made that I feel worth it.At first, I was hesitant to finalize my cart because I never heard of the brand before. Normally, I'd go for other brands I've known for years (like EVGA), but I was on a tight budget when I decided to build another PC. This PSU was on sale and so I made the purchase to save even just a bit. Now, I'm so glad I bought it. It's so silent. I don't think I'd look at other brands if this brand remains consistent with the quality. I might have to update this review after some time of use, though.",

                "reviewText": "I received the AGV650 on time. I was upgrading a computer to a 1660 super and only had a 400 watt power supply. This 650 watt power supply has no issues powering the GPU. Cables are braided for motherboard and look very nice in case. The rest of the cables are black and flat which are nice to cable manage. The PSU had the connections that I needed for new systems along with the old style molex connectors. The power supply is quiet and worked right out of the box using the included tester. Very happy with product price compared to other products. Will buy from seller again for other systems.",

                "reviewText": "My PSU suddenly failed on me and was looking for a replacement, was about to buy an EVGA 500W but stumbled upon this PSU.Upon, reviewing what others had to say, I pulled the trigger and bought the 650W model.The packaging is profressional and it even came with an inspection tool. The build quality is top notch, identical to my old thermaltake PSU. Everything installed perfectly.And it is powering my AMD fx8350, GTX 670, 2xSSD, 1xHDD, 1xbluray perfectly.This is probably the best bang for the bucks PSU out there.",
