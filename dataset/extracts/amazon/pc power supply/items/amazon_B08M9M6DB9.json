I like that I don't have extra unused cables but you have to plan ahead and plug everything in before you put the power supply in place then try and cram the thing in there with the nest of stiff cables in the way. It did not come with all the cables I needed since my motherboard needed a 4 pin 12V connector. I ordered the cable and it worked fine but I think they could have thrown in a splitter or a cable that was already split as on option.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased from Amazon on 6/14/23I liked the modular cords. That was a nice feature. This power supply is \"rated\" at 350 watts over my \"stock\" power supply (500 watt). The power supply was a smidgen larger than the \"hole\" it was supposed to fit into. I could get it to fit but it was a tricky process. It seemed to be a decent power supply.But after ~70 days it failed. Yesterday it just shut off. I could still see the lights on the motherboard. But it wouldn't power up. I unplugged it for a bit and then turned it back on and it was fine the rest of the day yesterday.Then today it wouldn't ever completely power up. And it almost trashed my SSD because it started to boot then powered off. I tried the unplug trick and it never came back. Would start then shut down almost immediately. Ugh!I swapped it for my old power supply and I'm doing fine again. This computer is an old computer with a new mobo, CPU, memory, etc. I replaced the power supply to be proactive. See how that worked out for me?I though Cooler Master was a good brand. Yes, it has a 5 year warranty. But I have to pay to ship it and do I really want another one of these??? I don't think so. This sucks. I want my money back. It wasn't cheap.",

                "reviewText": "I got this when it was on sale 850 V2 for $70. It was a very good deal. I really appreciate this seller!I use this with a power hungry 7900X. The PSU itself is not super quiet. It's ok. My last PSU was able to completely turn off fan, this one is always running at like 500-700rpm or something. But at this price, and 850W (849 of which are available on the 12V rail!). Also, it has only 2 EPS connectors, but you can always buy your own later. At my purchase price, it is great value for money.Product came sealed, but in its brand packaging (no outer Amazon box, which is good for the environment, I guess)Update:1 month later, I still have no problems.I notice the fan is kind of strange. It's not a smooth sound, it's kind of an warbling, like the blade or bearings are unbalanced. It was like this from the start, and has not changed. Also, the fan is supposed to be sucking from the top and blowing out the rear of the case, but if you put your hand over it you can feel it blowing out the top. Very peculiar. It's like the fan \"sucks\" literally/figuratively. Still, this was an amazing deal, if this lasts 5 years, it gets \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f from me.",

Also I installed ALL the included cables but really if you don't need to, you don't have to. I just installed it, but I was very happy with how silent it is and how well it integrated into my system. It was a bit larger than my previous PSU, but everything aligned very well. I would definitely recommend this PSU.",
