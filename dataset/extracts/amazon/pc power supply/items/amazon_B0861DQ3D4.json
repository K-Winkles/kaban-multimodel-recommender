                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. These extensions are actually great for the price. My only complaint is that they are so stiff and sort of hard to mold into place. I ended up having to remove a comb from the PCIE cable and zip tie it just because it was not wanting to stay in place. The back panel went on perfectly fine, and it wasn\u2019t terribly hard to cable manage. But, otherwise, easy 5 stars and I would recommend to anyone.",
