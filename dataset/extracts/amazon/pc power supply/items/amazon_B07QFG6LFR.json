I added a small cooling fan into the back of my entertainment center to cool my Xbox One X because it was in a rather enclosed space. The USB the three pin adapter allowed my to plug the fan into the back of my tv so now the fan only runs when my tv is on and the Xbox stays cool when I\u2019m gaming.The construction of the cable is a little flimsy and would definitely not be hard to break. The heat shrink has already started to move around on the cable and I only touched it to install it. This would have been a five start review if not for the mediocre construction.",

That being said, as everyone mentioned, this is just a two pin setup. But the fans ran as soon as I hooked them up and plugged them in to a USB outlet or a plugin adapter. This will run the fans at full speed and you will get a fair amount of breeze. Perfect for how i wanted to use this to cool additional electronics.",

                "reviewText": "I was surprised at the quality of the cable. The wire gauges are thick and a stiff braided sleeve and heat shrink have been applied. They went the extra mile and put some adhesive where the heat shrink meets the stress relief to anchor the sleeve to the wires. It also has a 4-pin female connector so you can use PWM fans, and not just the 3-pin variety. This cable came coiled, not folded and twisty tied (I hate when they do that, cables take forever to straighten out). Even the resealable bag it came in was thick.",
