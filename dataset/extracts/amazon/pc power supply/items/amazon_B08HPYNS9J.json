I buy these often for builds that people dont have it in the budget to buy an expensive name brand psu. The only con is probably that it only has one dual 4pin pci e cable so this would only be good for low to medium gpus. You could always use an adapter if your gpu doesnt draw too much power and would still be a budget choice.",

That is as far as the good comments go. Don't buy this! Your computer is worth more than a $27 power supply. It only lasted 15 minutes in my Xeon server build, then it made a loud snap/pop noise along with a shower of sparks, let the smoke out of teh box and quit working. You can forget about overcurrent protection, the only way this unit protects itself is by self destructing with a smoke and light show. ANYTHING that you want to power, even that old computer in the corner that you want to fire up again is worth getting a better power supply than this.",

                "reviewText": "*PLEASE AVOID* very bad power supply, have been building rigs for years. I know they recommend not use PSUs from unrecognized brands, but I figured because I was using weaker and low-end components, I\u2019d be okay given I bought this psu brand new, and was 100W over the recommend amount for my build.Wrong.Used this with a RX 570 and 3rd gen i5, which should only need 400-450W anyway. The PC booted up fine, didn\u2019t have any issues browsing. However, whenever the graphics card went under any type of load, even in loading screens (I tested with CSGO and TF2), the PC would either completely crash, or it would just go black. I was unable to get past the loading screen in any gaming title.Ended up switching to a used psu from a more reputable brand (won\u2019t name here because I\u2019m not promoting, just disappointed), and even though it was a 450W, 100W weaker, ran these titles with no issue. Clearly, the PSU wasn\u2019t even close to providing the amount of power this low-end GPU required.I don\u2019t see why anyone would need a psu over 300W if they\u2019re not gaming, so in no world would I recommend buying this.Would definitely seek a refund if I wasn\u2019t past the return window, but, hopefully, I can save someone time and money with this review.Cheers.",
