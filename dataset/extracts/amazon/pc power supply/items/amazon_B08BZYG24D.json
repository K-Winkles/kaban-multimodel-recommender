Yes, I did the classic \"cheap out on the power supply\" thing. Wouldn't you know, it lasted me all the way until a few months ago when I started to have issues with random restarts and such. I'd say I got my money's worth out of that $36 power supply. I was very surprised to see this power supply for sale 10 years after I bought the first one, for $36. Still. So of course I bought it again. It is working almost flawlessly, though the fan is a bit louder on this one and it only has one daisy chained PCI cable instead of the two the old one had.That being said, I wouldn't use this power supply on a build that costs any substantial money, as I did in the past. Juuuuust to be safe. Maybe I was just lucky. It's probably also super-inefficient compared to the new options available now, but hey. $36.Worked for me! Twice now. Happy customer.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered Apevia Power Supplies on two separate orders and Both were defective(EPS plug-ins on both PSUs). The last unit destroyed my digital PSU Tester. With the last defective PSU, Amazon first had me contact Apevia. Apevia's customer support is terrible. By the time Apevia would send out a replacement unit then it would be at least 10 days. Due to 2 New and Defective Apevia PSU units, the computer I was building was already on my work table for at least 10 days AND I would have to wait an extra 10 days for Apevia to send me another unit. The problem was with Apevia requiring me to ship it back to them and they had to process it, then ship out another unit. The Rep even checked on Amazon and saw I had ordered the PSU and saw that I received it the day I contacted them. I wanted Apevia to send one out right then and at the same time I would send the defective unit back to them. I even told Apevia that once I shipped it back and if they did not get the defective unit, then bill me for it. I just needed a working PSU - Fast. To finish this computer I traded locally for a working PSU. Due to Apevia's lack of customer support I will never buy another Apevia PSU. Unlike Apevia, Amazon issued a refund on the spot and to keep me from making and a hour round trip drive to UPS, Amazon told me dispose of it if I chose to do so. Thank You Amazon Rep Nali!!",
