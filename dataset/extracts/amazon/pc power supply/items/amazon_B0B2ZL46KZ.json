I use 12-24v AC to DC power supplies for various things in my home and shop and have always cobbled together some way of securing the power supply to the desk, wall or whatever. Usually use metal pipe strapping. Looks ugly but it works. These little things are perfect and fit any power supply as long as the power supply has the mounting points (the threaded hole and the upright \"slits\" to either side of the hole for the ears on the brack to slip through.) A little pricey for what they are, but a pack of eight will secure two power supplies. Recommended.",
