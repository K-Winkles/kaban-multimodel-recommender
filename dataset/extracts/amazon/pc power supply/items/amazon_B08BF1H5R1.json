                "reviewText": "My build included 13th Gen i7 with onboard graphics (no standalone graphics card), Rog Strix B760-I, FSP mini ITX 500Watt Flex Power Supply (PS) along with Noctua NH-L9i (37mm low profile), M.2 NVMe and 2 RAM sticks, all fitted in the really compact Goodisory A09 Black Mini-ITX 0.8mm SPCC Desktop Computer Case.After fitting everything in, the PS wire harnesses seemed to be using a lot of room and blocking the ventilation holes. I had to cut a lot of unused pieces of the wire harness to make room for ventilation. I could have gone with the 300 Watt modular version perhaps.However, once I had cut off and sealed the ends of the excess wire harness pieces, it was great. The temps in my case are very low and this PS contributes little to the heating or to the noise. There is a 40mm fan that runs pretty quietly. In a perfectly quiet room where this PC is always on, I hardly hear the PS fan noise. The processor fan noise from the Noctua, which itself is very low, is the only noise I hear from the build.Very good value for money IMO and a great Power Supply overall.",

The FSP Flex ATX 300W PSU surprisingly changes the game when it comes to my experience.Pros - What more can I say aside from this thing is silent, I have it running in my server with 8x 3.5mm HDD\"s running proxmox and it is silent, not a peep.Cons - wish it had a 6 or 8 pin VGA power connector to at least put in a low powered GPU into my rig, guess my RX 6400 will have to do for now.Other than that it does what you expect, provide power to your system, tho I wish it was 80+ platnium or at least gold, bronze is meh.",

                "reviewText": "Some other reviews say otherwise, but in my case, as well as my pc case haha, it\u2019s actually very quiet FOR A FLEX PSU. Sure there is some noise if you\u2019re very close to it. But if it\u2019s across the room, like a HTPC I hardly hear it, if at all. Powers my 1060 gpu very well, you will have to buy a gpu plug adapter, I I personally got a molex to 6 pin for very cheap on Amazon as well. Very happy with this purchase and will be my go to for flex psu\u2019s if I only need 300w.",

                "reviewText": "It is fairly quiet until you play a game. Then it gets quite a bit louder, but if noise isn't an issue for you then go for this PSU. It feels really quality and I haven't personally had any issues with it. I might swap the fan that it came with for a different one, like a noctua; but so far I don't care for the noise since I wear a headset a majority of the time anyways. There isn't much choice when you want a psu this powerful at this size, from what I have gathered, it is slim pickings. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it, it fit inside the GEEEK A31 V2 with plenty of room to spare.",

Smells exceedingly premium \ud83d\ude02 The fan isn't... too loud, but I'm OCD and can generally only tolerate noctuas, so I swapped it with a 40mm x 10mm noctua fan and covered the gap with high-temperature resistance electrical tape \ud83d\udc4d. Totally worth it - for me, at least. I don't imagine most people will mind. I then routed the new noctua psu fan to the mobo. All is well. Just make sure that the fan has access to cool air so that it's not circulating hot air from within your case.",
