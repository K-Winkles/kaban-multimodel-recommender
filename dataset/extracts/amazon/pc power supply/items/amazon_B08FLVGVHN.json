                "reviewText": "So I sometimes need to power 5v and 12v fans or battery chargers and I bought this because the price looked good. If I had done some research I would have seen the terrible reputation these have. When it blew up on me I was actually using it to test a boost converter and had a DC clamp meter on the wire running from the boost converter output to the input of a battery. I was charging a scooter battery so I was boosting the voltage from 12v to 42v and taking measurements to test the efficiency of the boost converter. I had the clamp meter measuring output current while I was doing some math and had been pulling 7A for maybe a minute when I heard a loud pop. Upon opening it up I see a bunch of burned out zener diodes. Its probably fixable but doing some math and being generous 7A multiplied by a boost factor of 4 is 28A. Assuming the converter is 90% efficient (its actually 92% or higher) that would be less than 31A. The boost factor is only 3.5 so realistically I was pulling 24.5+2.5=27A.Derate it. It should be listed as a 350W power supply. Seller was kind of willing to work with me when I told them I had zero hope of Apevia making this right but they didn't have much I was interested in (doing some kind of exchange minus the price of the Apevia PSU) so I let it go. The seller gets a good rating, but the product is cheap junk. Sticking with HP Proliant Power Supplies from now on.",

                "reviewText": "Very well made power supply for its price range. couple things i do have to say about this power supply is that1. There is no 6 pin or 8 pin connector. If you are building a PC and hoping to put in a GPU(Graphics Card) Please note that the GPU you are installing doesn't need a 6 pin or 8 pin connector supplying it power and needs to take in power directly from the motherboard. The power supply itself looks like it was only made to give power to the motherboard and no other add-ons that require a 6 or 8 pin connector.Another alternative to counter this is additionally buying a Sata to 6 pin adaptor or 8 pin adaptor if you are looking to install a GPU requiring power directly being supplied into it from the power supply.The power supply has 3 sata ports.another thing I only have to talk about is that the cables come in the mustard yellow, black and red cables in which are not pleasing to the eye and aren't a flat color. but if you dont that and aren't looking to build for looks and are looking for budget and performance this power supply is a good choice",

Is super quiet and just enough power for my gpu GT 1030 that pulls power from the board not additional power needed for my gpu. However if you have a GPU with side connector for afditiona power this psu wont suffice because the 8 or 6 pin splits only into sets of 2 making 2x 4pin connectors and in my pc the motherboard requires 4 straight to the board for power besides the 24 pin. So motherboard takes 24 pin plus a 4pin black and yellow leaving with only a spare of 4 pin black and yellow. If you gpu does not require additional power GET THIS PSU!!",
