One of the last things I need to do is potentially get a better CPU cooler and high grade thermal paste due to my desktop being over 70\u00b0C. Both are on their way. Im really excited. I will be able to use my stuff and play my games again for the first time in over 6 months. Bf broke my $2500 laptop landing me in a massive perdictiment. I can't wait to see how much the power supply can handle. easy to use. A bit heavier than it looks but works well. Smells like fresh plastic when you're the box. That new rubber smell. Mmmm so nice. Wonderful a power bank that can support a G1 gaming motherboard and minimum of 16 GB ram and im planning to RGB everything eventually. It will support it. \ud83d\ude0e",

So first time plugging in the power supply was done incorrectly but after my second try I got it all working correctly. so to other buyers look closely at the plugs and what you are plugging into, it will save you sometime and not have to redo it like I did. so other than my little mistake the power supply work perfectly.",
