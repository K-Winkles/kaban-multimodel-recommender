Turn on the power, and the sound of \"drip irrigation\" sounds two kinds of sounds. If the value of each group does not flash, it means that the power input is normal. 3. If the circuit voltage signal is not detected (such as 20PIN or 24PIN connector) or the detected voltage exceeds the normal range, the buzzer will issue a \"drip\" warning for a long time, and the corresponding voltage or PG value will be displayed . If the status flashes, it means that the power supply is faulty!
