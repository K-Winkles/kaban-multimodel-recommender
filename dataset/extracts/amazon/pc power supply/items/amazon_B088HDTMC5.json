The second is a smaller issue, could use about 2 more clips for the cable's, but was able to get the cable's lined up straight and even. So, it's 4 star's overall.",

I am giving the unbiased fair complete review about this product Motherboard ATX 24-Pin Female to Male 90 Degree Power Supply Adapter Sleeved PSU Cable Extension (Crystal White). It is perfect, This adapter cable is designed to change the mounting direction of the ATX 24-PIN cable and install the 24-pin power cable from the vertical to the horizontal orientation, which will solve the PSU installation problem for the limited height chassis. This is my second review.",
