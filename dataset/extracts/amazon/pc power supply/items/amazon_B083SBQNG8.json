They come as 6+2 but the combs hold all the cables in a bunch. I cut the extra cables and then used rough sandpaper to remove the extra plastic rings on the combs.- Cables have a \"bend\". I wrongly assumed the bend would be in the direction I was expecting for the GPU cables. Luckily for me it isn't a problem, I bent them the other way and now there's excess bunching, but it's hidden from view.- Kind of hard to manage the excess length",
