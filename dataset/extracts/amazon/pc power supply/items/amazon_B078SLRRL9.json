Since I couldn't find it, and wanted to see if the NUC (NUC 1) was still practical, I ordered this. Then I found my other NUC (NUC 2), with its power adapter, and discovered that IT IS still practical. When Amazon delivered the other power adapter I fired up NUC 1, removed personal data, then wiped it and added Fedora - sold it on ebay. Made about 50% of my original 2017 purchase. Not bad.",
