The larger motherboard plugin has two sections, one being a 4-pin, that\u2019s a bit difficult to slide onto the other piece because you have to pull on the cords a bit to do it, so be careful. It did come with the little black wire for the F1 \u201cPower supply fan not detected\u201d error, but I still get the error every time I boot up my HP Elite 8100. It might be better in an 8200/8300. Still, it didn\u2019t set my PC on fire like I\u2019ve read about in reviews for other versions of this cord by other brands, nor did it short circuit my hardware. If not for the fan error, I\u2019d give this five stars!",
