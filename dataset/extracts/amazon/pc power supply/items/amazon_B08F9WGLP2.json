This module triggers the secondary PSU to start at the same time as the Dell PSU inside the desktop. From my research its really important to make sure if you run a 2nd PSU that they both start at the exact time. This module does exactly that. I've had it for about 4 months now and no problems. Great solution if you want to have a 2nd PSU. Now all I have to do is hit the (ON) button and they both start up. The same when shutting down the desktop, both PSU's stop at the same time.",
