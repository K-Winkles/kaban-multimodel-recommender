                "reviewText": "Received for unbiased review...This is an 80+ Bronze power supply (power efficiency rating). (Note: I found a peculiar problem with this power supply. If you happen to have a static discharge from your hand to the computer case, the power supply immediately shuts down instead of grounding out the discharge. This is bad for data protection, as your machine could shut off in the middle of writing data. It may be to protect your motherboard from back voltages, but it should protect the computer to a certain extent without having to cut all the power off. i had this happen while just trying to put the case cover back on the computer. As soon as the cover touched the rest of the case it immediately shut off. Complete shut off from touching the case has happened several times.)I ordered this for an older Intel Core 2 Quad 6550 system, and so far it has been fairly quiet. The temperature has not felt overly hot, and the fan has stayed at a steady low speed. The RGB fan looks really neat with its colour cycling. It isn't like my other 650 80+Gold of a different brand (which got transplanted to another computer) which doesn't run the fan at all until it needs to. I'm reducing a star because I could see the capacitor types through the grill, and they do not look like solid capacitors. This means lesser longevity, and less heat tolerance. I don't have an oscilloscope so I can't tell you how clean the power is. But so far, it is doing a good job. I always use a power supply that is much higher wattage than necessary for my builds to make sure it lasts. If you are using a system that isn't too demanding on power, a 650W capable power supply is a good purchase. It should give you a decent amount of overhead for a good graphics card (If you are going to be using a high end graphics card you should get a much higher wattage power supply and quality for longevity).",

                "reviewText": "I've had this running an i3 for the last week and so far not had any issues with it as far as performance goes.It's also powering a 1080, but neither the CPU nor GPU has been driven hard.The fan runs quiet, but I'm not a fan of RGB lighting. If I want to see that much colour, I'll set up Christmas lights in my room. There is no way to turn off the LEDs.Fortunately, the lights are at the rear, so they aren't that much of a distraction.The big problem here is that this is NOT a modular PSU. There is just one big bundle of cables that come out of it, which makes it messy when trying to control airflow. I don't like having a rat's nest of cables that need to be somehow tied back or moved to avoid blacking airflow. It's like stepping back into the late '90s when every PSU was set up this way. I'm not sure it's worth saving $20 instead of getting a brand name with modular cables.So performance-wise, it works well, but if you're one of those people who like RGB lightings and want to show off the innards of your tower, you probably won't like it because of the cables mucking things up.For anyone who's more into just powering up a PC and not concerned about what the inside looks like this will probably work.",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. Aside from the packaging claiming that unit has modular cabling and multi-gpu support, I can confirm that is a non-modular unit; There is only a pair of 6+2 pin PCIe power connections running off a single cable which is enough for the majority of single GPU configurations. If you're on a really tight budget, this power supply can definitely get you up and running without much hassle.I appreciate the all black cabling as it can definitely blend in discreetly into a black framed computer tower; With this non-modular design, an ATX mid-tower case would be sufficient to manage the cable length; It might be more difficult with a smaller enclosure to find a place to stuff the excess cabling.The unit itself does come packaged with a protective black foam sleeve and you do get four cable ties along with four case screws; I do find the construction quite lightweight compared to other PSU units I've installed in previous systems. The fan is fairly quiet and stays spinning while the unit is on; It does have four independent LEDs which cycle colours at random intervals; There is no way to control the lighting for the unit nor sync it up any other additional lighting accessories.I do find that the sata power cables ending off with molex connections odd; I would have prefered sata power connections as the single endpoint and have the molex connections grouped together. For additional length for the fixed cables, you can definitely add a cable extension kit to reach the 8-pin EPS connection better on a motherboard.",
