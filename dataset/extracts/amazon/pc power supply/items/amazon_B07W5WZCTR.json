                "reviewText": "UPDATE 1.12.21Still working like a champ, this PSU has been great with no concerns at allI ordered this PSU for my girlfriend who's previous garbage PSU was failing and causing restarts when her gtx 970 tried firing up. The install was pretty easy going for this GD 600w, same as any PSU install. For being a non modular PSU I was a bit freaked out when I went through the cables and didn't see molex connectors, but I actually just missed them, as they are attached to the same cables as the SATA connectors. I don't know if that's a general thing with EVGA PSUs, but I'm actually quite a fan of it, made cable management a bit more pleasing for me. I really happy to find a gold rated unit and I'm hoping that'll keep up for years to come. It's only been a few hours so far, but this seems like quite a great PSU for the 55 bucks I paid for it and would definitely recommend. If and when I start having issues, I'll update my review.",
