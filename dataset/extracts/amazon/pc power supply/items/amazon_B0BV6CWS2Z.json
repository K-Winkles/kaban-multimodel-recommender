A 6-pole fan motor ultimately makes for less vibration, super-long life and minimal power consumption. Innovative Cooling Concept The split fan inlet of the Dark Power 13 1000W is a custom-shaped funnel that increases airflow while reducing unwanted turbulence. The wire-free design inside allows the cool air to reach all components flawlessly which ultimately leads to a longer lifespan. Ready for Overclocking Dark Power 13 1000W is particularly suitable for overclocking. The overclocking key gives you full overclocking control by manually switching between the default four 12V-rail mode and the alternative massive single-rail operation.",

I've had no issues with it so far, the setup is straightforward if you've ever installed a power supply on a computer before. Pretty much plug and play. It comes with all the cords you might need and the packaging is very well done.I upgraded and went for a PS that was slightly more than what I needed, no matter which level you choose, I think this company stands behind their product.",

Just know that it works without any problems. PCIe 5.0 cable fits my 4070ti perfectly. Hope it lasts without problems.",
