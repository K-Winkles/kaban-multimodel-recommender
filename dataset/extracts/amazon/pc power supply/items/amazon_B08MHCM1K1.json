                "reviewText": "Update: it's been a few weeks, with some hardcore gaming, no smoke, no fires, no failed boots, no shut downs, it's solid, nice not to have to use og cables and extension..So I have a modular gigabyte ud850gm pg5 PSU, I know that you can't use cables from other PSUs with it, because they are all pinned differently. I looked for hours on videos (jay2cents and others) and tons of sites to see if there is a standard for 12vhpwr cables on modular PSUs and found nothing..But for some stupid reason I decided to use this 12vhpwr cable that says it's designed to go from the PSU to the GPU (not an extension), I even asked the question, can it really go straight into the GPU and be used on my specific PSU..Well it looks great, stiff as hell (which is good at the connections), and it has yet to burn up my PC or even shut it down. I ran heaven to push it and there was no smoke, I put my fingers around both ends of the connections to see if I could feel excessive heat, I didn't. So though it was stupid to even chance it, it works as of maybe 20 min ago, I'll play some diabloIV tonight and see if that produces any smoke, I'm still pessimistic that it's okay..If I don't run into any issues, LINKUP is a quality squared company that I will tell others about, I'll give a well done and bump it up a star in couple days or so..",

                "reviewText": "This is for: LINKUP AVA Right Angle 600W PCIE 5.0 12VHPWR cable (male to male).I am using a Seasonic Vertex ATX 3.0 1200W PSU which originally provided a male to male 12VHPWR with both ends straight (180 degrees). This worked but as one attached image shows, at the RTX 4090 GPU end of cable, the straight connector was a bit too protuding and close to the case side cover (partly on account of other cables/coolant hoses). The cable under review has corrected this problem most adequately. I have attached images showing how the new cable helps.The connectors with the cable seem very good, they mated with the PSU and GPU very securely without wobble. Others have reported power limiting issues but in my circumstances, this didn't happen. If anything the cable seems to seems to support more GPU power draw. I have a watt meter on the system inlet power and with this cable, the OCCT power stress test max system draw increased from about 1050W to about 1100W, or about a 50W delta. So at the very least, this cable does not limt the GPU power-wiseWhen I got the cable the first thing I did was to verify that it's wired the same as the original (using an ohm/continuity checker) and found that it matches. The cable length on my sample was about 70CM as spec'd and includes cable combs and tie-wraps. I would have preferred a 50CM cable length but this one is 5cm shorter than the Seasonic original cable so while th new cable is not exactly as desired, it is still easier to cable manage in the case. The cable seems to come only in black but that is what I wanted.I could have gotten this cable from Cable Mod in my exact cable length but it would have been more expensive and taken a lot longer to recieve. I also could have used a right angle extension but that would have added an additional connector in the path and would have also resulted in more even more overall cable length. Note that the right angle GPU connector has two orientaions, \"a\" and \"b\". Be sure to the get the oreientation that matches your needs.In summary, I recommend this cable for circumstances similar to mine: a Seasonic Vertex ATX 3.0 PSU, an RTX 4090 and a Corsair 5000D Airflow case where the cable is more than long enough. The only caveat is that if you use it with a different model of PSU, you should check to be sure that the new cable pinout matches the prior cable pinout.",
