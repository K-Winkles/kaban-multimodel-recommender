                "reviewText": "Cybenetics ratings are more tightly controlled then other ratings systems (don't take my word for it, look it up) and this 850 watt PSU is Platinum rated. So I wasn't really worried my system would boot right up...which it did.Modular cables are where it's at for any good power supply, a really nice collection of cables are included along with a bag which I have now stuffed all my random modular cables into. The cables are white too. For out of the box cables these are nice, but if you are looking for those high end custom cables a separate kit may be needed.ATX 3.0 adds the 12 volt high power connector (12vhpwr) which this power supply has. The 12vhpwr connector also communicates power info to whatever it is connected to (GPU). This means that a well designed card (GPU) can now limit its power spikes if the power supply is under rated, the system can communicate this info to the user instead of the entire system just not booting, or crashing randomly, and it informs all of us on just how much power a hungry GPU can pull...which is a LOT.850 watts is considered the minimum starting point for a high end system, if the system is going to have a high power, high end card(GPU) with a power hungry CPU in it then 1200 watts is where it is at. Ironically the high power rating is need to handle power spikes and not constant power supply. Also, ATX3.0 should help expensive cards (GPU) last better since it is less likely to overdraw the PSU causing system damage. (ie many bucks going down the toilet)Right now only a few cards out there have the 12vhpwr connector, but expect most cards to start shipping with it. So this power supply is pretty future proof.Part of the reason I gave this 5 stars is my experience with Zalman PSU's has been stellar, and they have a very good rep.My only gripe about this PSU is the metal fan protector is painted black on the white PSU...in my white case...with white cables...and a white gpu...with a white MB...and glass sides on the case...with lighting inside so we can all see the black fan cover.",

                "reviewText": "This review is for the Zalman TeraMax II 850W ATX 3.0 fully modular power supply featuring support for the 12VHPWR (12+4 pin) connector (Model: ZM850-TMX2, Color: White). I've been building PCs for longer than I'd care to admit, and while I've used Zalman cooling products before, this is the first time I've used a Zalman-branded power supply. Overall, this power supply exudes high quality and has test reports from reputable agencies to back it up. The ATX 3.0 specification highlights Cybenetics Lab's ETA efficiency and LAMDA noise testing methods, which this PSU has undergone.My only niggle with this unit is how Zalman doesn't provide any means for power budgeting. Since the ZM850-TMX2 has a single rail design and the included 12VHPWR cable is rated for the full 600W, this power supply can theoretically support the most power-hungry graphics cards to date. However, this isn't necessarily a good thing since, as an 850W PSU, if your overclocked GPU can reach 600W, you're only left with 250W for the rest of the system. An Intel i7-13700K has a TDP of 125W, but max turbo power can be as high as 253W, so unexpected restarts under heavy loads might occur.For those that don't know, the 12VHPWR connector has sideband signals that will communicate the PSU's maximum capability to the GPU, which can vary from as low as 150W up to 600W. Therefore, just because the PSU/GPU has the connector, it doesn't mean the 600W power level is available.I would have preferred Zalman give us the option to limit 12VHPWR to 450W, which would be nearly foolproof from a stability perspective when using non-HEDT components. In fact, the ATX 3.0 specification's arguably over-conservative \"Power Budget Used for Peak Power Excursion Test Cases\" states that a 750W PSU is only expected to supply 300W of PCIe add-in-card capability and a 1000W model only needs up to 450W.Notes:1) According to the label, the power supply is manufactured by Shenzhen Jiumeng Electronics Technology Co, Ltd.",

                "reviewText": "This PSU came on for sale and I thought it would be great for my new quiet PC. The PC turned out so quiet, that I now hear a very annoying, high pitched ticking from the power supply. It is audible in my quiet, small office, when the fans of the PC are in low RPM mode or off. I sit about 5 foot from the PC.Anyway, japanese capacitors and platin efficiency rating back and forth, I do not understand why Zalman send me this unit from their factory - it did not have a quality assurance sticker either, so i guess they just package them as they fall off the factory line and send them out? Will have to return this unit and rebuild the entire cabling in the PC. how annoying.",

                "reviewText": "Build qualityThe power supply is high quality and has a good finish that looks great. The unit is quite heavy and feels solid. The cables are also white and look great as well.ColorThe power supply looks great and is a good match for my white mid tower case.PowerAlthough I know I'm not taxing my PS -- I am using it to power a (Single) high end video card and a (up to 250W+ TDP) unlocked intel CPU as well as 3 SSDs and 1 large 3.5 and quite a few USB devices. I am having no issues with power.Fan noiseThe fan is very quiet -- just mild wind noise but no mechanical noise. It produces good air flow.FitThe cables are a good length to fit most mid atx motherboard + cases -- it worked on mine.Final thoughtsThis is a great power supply that is quiet, efficient and looks great. I recommend it.",
