All was well when I built it but once he got it home and tried turning it on all the lights started flickering then it finally shut down and won't restart. No power to anything. Tried to diagnose over the phone since he is 11 and all I can surmise is the power supply was a lemon. Apevia is not known for top tier quality with items like this but are a budget option. I guess I'll stick with the bigger names.... more reliable. Hopefully others have better luck.",
