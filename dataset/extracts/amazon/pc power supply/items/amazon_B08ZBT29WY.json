It supports the modern 12v2.3 power standard with a single 12V rail setup. Boasting a silent 120mm black fan, it keeps everything inside the system cool. Comes with enough cables to connect all the devices you might need. The ATX-ES600W power supply is semi-modular and perfect for mid-range builds for both business and gaming use. IMPORTANT: The power supply will not power on simply by connecting the power cord to both the power supply and wall outlet. Ensure that all the power supply cables are properly connected to the PC for it to power on. IMPORTANT: The 8pin CPU connector can be split apart to become a 4+4 connector by pushing one end of the 4pin down and the other end of the 4pin up for motherboards that require a 4pin power connector. IMPORTANT: The 8pin PCI-E GPU connector can be split apart to become a 6+2 connector by pushing one end of the 6pin down and the other end of the 2pin up for graphics cards that require a 6pin power connector. IMPORTANT: The 24pin motherboard connector can be split apart to become a 20+4 connector by pushing one end of the 20pin down and the other end of the 4pin up for motherboards that require a 20pin power connector",

After process of elimination, I narrowed it down to the cord. finally got it working last night, went to bed, when I woke up this morning, hit the power button, screen flashed, instant burn smell, I quickly powered off my PSU, and then it wouldn't turn on at all afterwards. Plugged in my old PSU and everything works, except my zotac 980 AMP now will not turn work. I have put another graphics card in, and everything works except my ZOTAC 980 AMP. Now I am out a graphics card and the money for this PSU. will be requesting a refund immediately.",
