                "reviewText": "I was pretty glad that I was able to get some 16AWG gauge thick wire. That in itself is very good especially since thicker wire is always better, more safe, and durable than the more common 18awg gauge wire used in most cables. Also the connectors were pink and transparent so that is also a good thing. Most cable connectors are black and that\u2019s kind of boring. But what I was surprised about was the amount of cable combs. It included some 16ohm cable combs so I was able to combine the 2 GPU connectors into a single cable. Also the LED RGB strips in my computer make the pink cable glow and it looks neon. It doesn\u2019t glow at all with just the ARGB fans at all. Only with RGB led\u2019s. It just worked out really well for my build. They should also add one more cable, making it dual EPS cables and dual GPU cables. I had to use a black 4pin EPS and the pink 4+4 eps cable on my PC build. These work really well for any builds. And I didn\u2019t have any extra slack because I used these extensions on an SFX power supply that had short cables. I dunno I just recommend these cables if you want pink cables.",

I've bought 3 separate sets, all on separate occasions, and this is how it went:First set was clearly previously returned and missing the clear cable combs. However, it still looked new and worked well enough so I kept it.Second set was also very obviously previously returned. The cables were mismatched (see pic) and this time the black cable combs were missing. Furthermore, the 24 pin extension piece and CPU power extension piece would not connect to my PSU cables no matter how hard I tried. After careful inspection I noticed that the pins were all bent up and misaligned. Ended up returning that set.The third and latest set I ordered was perfect. No complaints there.",
