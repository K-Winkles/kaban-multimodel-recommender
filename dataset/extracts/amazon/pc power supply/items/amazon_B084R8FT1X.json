                "reviewText": "Power supplies are an easy to overlook part of a build. Enough watts is enough watts right? It's a tempting part of the build to try to skimp on and save a few bucks. But it's a worthwhile investment to get a trusted brand. A PSU can survive multiple builds. You'll be upgrading other parts long before you have to replace a quality PSU. This investment in the future saves money in the long run. Not to mention the peace of mind that it won't catch fire or something!Trusted brands and quality PSU's don't all have to be Gold and Platinum though. You don't have to go all out. Doesn't hurt if you can afford it. But a quality Bronze is miles ahead of a generic Gold that has over promised. I was slapping this thing in a HTPC build and just wanted reliability. It's more than enough. EVGA uses and contracts out quality manufacturers on their PSU lines. Of which they arguably have too many. But you're almost assuredly in good hands with EVGA PSUs. Their customer service is amazing and second to none, which is becoming increasingly hard to come by in the tech space.As of the writing of this EVGA is the whole package. Buy with confidence.",

I have been troubleshooting for weeks only to realize the fan is not spinning on the PSU. I assumed since it was brand new that nothing would be wrong. It is still providing power but not able to withstand the heat since the fan is not working so it is shutting off. Please see the video attached where you can see the fan is not spinning. It is very hard for me to ship this back to you. Please let me know how can i return this for another or a refund.Update 2020-09-18: Since it couldn't be returned i decided to open it up. I found a piece of plastic that was stuck inside the blades, preventing the movement. Had to use a tweezer to pull it out. After pulling it out the fan started spinning but with a weird audible noise. Maybe because it was held back during use. So far my system doesn't shut off again.I suggest that you guys check on debree before shipping.",

                "reviewText": "Excellent. It powers my whole system. Before this I was using a thermal take power supply. Within 3-4 months the thermatake psu decides to give out on me, and I contacted thermaltake support and they refused me a refund/ new power supply. I do not recommend thermaltake for power supplies.After doing some research into a more reliable brand, I came across evga. And ordered this bad boy. I\u2019m very content with my purchase. And straight off the bat as a comparison. I weighed the power supply. comparing it to my old thermaltake one, out of curiosity. Evga\u2019s power supply was 4 times heavier than thermaltake. Now i\u2019m not a PC professional by any means, but this just tells me Thermaltake uses cheap chinese parts and don\u2019t really care about quality. Evga is the opposite, and it shows. Evga cares about the quality of their products and they continue to make high quality power supplies. Don\u2019t make the same mistake I did though. Don\u2019t buy thermaltake power supplies. Buy from reliable brands. Evga is a reliable brand.",
