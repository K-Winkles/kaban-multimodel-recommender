                "reviewText": "Put this in an i7 5820k and gtx 1080 xtreme build and it\u2019s working perfectly fine. The fan is quiet, they give you pretty much all of the cables you\u2019ll need, they even give you the 4 screws to mount it in the back of your case! The only complaint I have is that the vga pigtail cable(it\u2019s a gtx 1080 and it can\u2019t consume more than 200 watts so it\u2019s ok) is a bit tight so it pushes up against the side panel while also making plugging it in slightly difficult and there wasn\u2019t much to protect it in shipping other than a layer of bubble wrap and the packaging itself to keep it in place. I will say, the packaging it self was awesome, it feels premium and I\u2019d gladly show this off.",

It is only 80+ Bronze (still good, but Gold would be preferred), but for the price and size it is really good. I needed this for a build where the PSU had to be as small as it could be in length (SFX are too expensive) and this worked great.If you are not comfortable with buying the Apevia Prestige 600W (best budget unit imo), or need a shorter one, then this is definitely a great option.",
