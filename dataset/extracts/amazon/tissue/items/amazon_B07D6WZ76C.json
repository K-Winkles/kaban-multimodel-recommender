The quality of these tissues is definitely superior to other brands. The size of the pack is ideal for pockets, purses, and glove compartments. We live in New England and it is a necessity to keep a pack with you when walking in the cold air. I like to have them all year. I use these to dry my eyeglasses because they don\u2019t leave traces of tissue on the lens so I keep them with me whenever I travel.",
