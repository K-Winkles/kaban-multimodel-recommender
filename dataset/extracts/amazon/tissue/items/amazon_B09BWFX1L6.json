                "reviewText": "Listen, I'm not one to spend a fortune on paper towels. I mean, they're for wiping up spills, not winning awards, right? But these Amazon Basics 2-Ply Flex-Sheets? They seriously impressed me. First off, the quality is top-notch. They're just as thick and absorbent as the name brands, without the fancy packaging or eye-watering price tag. Spills disappear in a flash, even the sticky, crusty ones that make you question life choices. Plus, they tear off clean thanks to the Flex-Sheets thing, so no more raggedy edges hanging around. But here's the real kicker: these paper towels don't just get the job done, they make it kinda fun. Like, I don't know how they do it, but wiping down the counters feels strangely satisfying with these guys. Maybe it's the subtle crinkle, or the way they hold up to even the messiest cleaning tasks without turning into mush. Whatever it is, I'm sold. So, if you're looking for high-quality paper towels that won't break the bank, do yourself a favor and grab these Amazon Basics Flex-Sheets. They're all the thrills, none of the frills, and that's exactly what I need from a roll of paper. Five stars, easy!",

                "reviewText": "I normally order presto brand but with Black Friday these were on sale for $6 cheaper so rubbing pennies together I decided to order these instead. Worst decision I ever made. Yes, they are paper towels but not sure where some are getting this softness from cause these are definitely not soft in any way shape or form. These are almost like rough tissue paper. You try to rip one off the roll and you only get a half ripped piece since these are so thin. Not durable at all. I'm seriously considering just ordering my presto and just store these for backup. What a waste of money.",

While they're decent as paper towels, they're not as thick. They're decent at absorbing but the texture of itself is what I don't like. I feel like it's too rough and not fluffy enough. But if you're into the more rough than fluffy then I'd definitely give these a try.",
