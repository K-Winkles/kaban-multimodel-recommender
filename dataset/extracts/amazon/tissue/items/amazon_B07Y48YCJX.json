                "reviewText": "I wanted to compare these tissues to Costco\u2019s Kirkland tissues. These were just as nice and sturdy and soft as the Kirkland brand. In fact, i think they are nicer and softer. I also appreciate that the first one comes out of the box by itself. With Kirkland, you get two right away. Also, they all come out without a gap, meaning sometimes in the Kirkland brand, you'll pull out a tissue and then the rest are left inside the box with none ready to pull out. Never have this problem with the Amazon brand. Only issue is the single slit in the plastic for the tissues to come out of. The single slit makes pulling them out a bit harder. So I simply used a scissors and cut two cross slits in the plastic. That helped a lot.The reason I wanted to compare is because you can get 18 boxes of the Amazon brand for roughly the same price as the Kirkland 12 pack. I will be switching to this product. I don\u2019t have to drive to Costco to get tissues anymore.",

                "reviewText": "Puffs used to be sooooo good. Not so much these days the quality has gone down hill. However Kleenex has improved some of it's branched out competition lines to compete with Puffs. I went with these to try out a new tissue box I bought and only had the full size Puff boxes on hand. Well maybe a mistake. However I will use them up over the winter and just not buy again. I live 200 miles round trip to the world of shopping like Wally world and Target etc. I know there are still rural places in the USA here in MT that are that far away from ultra populations. I think the term is fly over zone. Most of the USA is fly over. Love Amazon gives us options to stay in touch and enjoy what others enjoy. However this one let me down. On the good note it didn't fall apart when using. It's kind of stiff not super soft but works fine in a pinch just not for if I got a cold and needed tissues all day long. It would ruin my nose for sure then. So if you are an occasional sniffer this may be for you but I've got sinus problems and need a little more reliable and soft approach 24/7. My fault for buying actually so not a 1 star...I'd give it a 3 for trying.",
