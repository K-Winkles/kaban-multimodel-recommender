I was angry with myself at first because the last time I tried Kleenex, it was nowhere near as good as Puffs. But these are really good tissues. Puffs ultra are still less expensive, though...by a couple dollars...so I'm staying with Puffs ultra. But my subscribe and save now includes Kleenex as my second/backup choice.",

We do not like the \"lotion\" kind, and these without are great and soft.The one thing I will say that is relly not quality-rated is WHAT WERE THEY THINKING when they changed the box design ( color and pattern). These are the ugliest boxes you could come up with. Good thing I but fo the product and not the box art. It it was for the art image, these would be near the bottom of the list",

Was able to find them fast :)Very high qualityVery impressedItem was shipped without delay in perfect condition with no shipping logistics issue",

The durability is in the thickness you can blow all day and night and there is no snot leaking through and onto your hands. Cons the box design is kind of ugly to me, just not my style. It is bright and happy at least. I do not buy tissues based on the packaging I buy them for performance. I can not find Kleenex in stores anymore being in Canada. I was super happy to buy these on Amazon and they arrived the next day too. I hope they continue to be available. I will buy again.",
