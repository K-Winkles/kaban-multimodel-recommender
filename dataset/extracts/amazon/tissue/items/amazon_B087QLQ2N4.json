                "reviewText": "I recently purchased these for use in remote areas without readily available facilities. However, these little wonders have proven to be versatile beyond what I initially purchased them for. If you're considering them for travel or dealing with messy situations, here's why I find them to be an convenient:Convenience and Versatility:Initially purchased for use in remote locations, they have proven their worth in more ways than one. From camping trips to dealing with messy situations while traveling with children, these compact and lightweight tablets have become an essential part of my travel kit.Size and Durability:The size of the wipes is decent and surprisingly sturdy for their compact form. They expand into a practical and reliable option for personal hygiene or cleaning up messes, especially when dealing with kids or in situations where standard facilities aren\u2019t readily available.Potential for Reusability:Though I haven't personally tried reusing them, the sturdiness of the wipes does make me think they might be viable for a second use after rinsing and drying. This potential for reusability might further enhance their value, especially for longer trips or reducing waste.Portability and Ease of Use:Their compressed size makes them incredibly portable, fitting effortlessly into any travel bag or even a pocket.

Now, I\u2019m not suggesting any public indecency here, but if there isn\u2019t any toilet paper around these things will save your butt (ha ha). Also, they work great for washing hands, cleaning up messes or blowing your nose when no napkins are close by.They are easy to put into a pocket, expand quickly and are large enough to be useful. I carry mine with everywhere as part of an emergency kit.You can\u2019t go wrong with these things.",

                "reviewText": "Extremely compressed...I mean impressed!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc4dThese things are absolutely amazing! I don't know how they get towels into such tiny little tablets. My wife and I bought these for our bug out bags and they are just phenomenal. You can use them as paper towels, tissues, TP or whatever else you're big heart desires!Why you should:These towels are strong, compact and you are getting a ton of them for your money. They come with four plastic cases so that means you can keep one container in the car, one container in your bag, so on and so forth. Extremely convenient, well-made oh oh, and guess what else?? They are reusable! You can use a towel, wash it and then reuse it again! Doesn't get much better than this. I could imagine these would be great for camping, road trips and especially if you have children. The item arrived on time and intact.Why you shouldn't:There are cheaper brands out there that you might want to explore before you purchase this one. I can't tell you though that I am very happy with this brand and if I purchase in the future I will definitely be purchasing from this particular seller and brand name.I highly recommend these towels and hope that you use them in good health!",

It's always fun to see people freak out a little when I hand them one. Walking on a trail and walking buddy complains of itchy, dirty legs?? Bam!! Friend's toddler needs a wipe-down and the diaper bag is in the car?? Bam!! Kids have sticky fingers after a treat at the street market?? Bam!! Walked through a spiderweb?? Bam!! I drink a ton of water, so I always have a water bottle with me. I even use these at the gym to wipe down my equipment. It doesn't disintegrate and leave little paper pills all over the handles. I just spray the tablet with the sanitiser spray and it expands into a cleaning wipe. I can use the same one for my whole workout instead of half a dozen paper towels; just spritz between machines. I used to carry a travel pack of baby wipes, and they'd dry out or leak in my bag because the container is faulty. I couldn't use them because I have allergies to weird things. But these are so versatile!! Soft and strong. I've even spritzed them with hand sanitiser to clean hands. I use a liquid sanitiser, so it soaks it right up.",
