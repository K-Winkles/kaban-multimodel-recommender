They get stepped on, squished between groceries, etc. These round containers work great as they fit in a space in my door where I can easily find them and they don't wander off somewhere. Soft and gently, as kleenex brand tends to be. I thought they were pretty spendy though, but I guess having them securely in one spot is worth it for me.",

There is no flat surface between the front seats to keep a box of tissues, only the round drink cup holders. This is the only package that stays put and is incredibly convenient for driver and passenger. The other box styles may be better value but not for a car!",
