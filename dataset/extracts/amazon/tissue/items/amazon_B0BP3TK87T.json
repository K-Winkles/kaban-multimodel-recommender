We all know there are times when we need that perfect sweet spot between a good clean wipe and comfort and I believe cottonelle ultra clean found it. We\u2019ve tried all kinds of toilet tissue and this seems to work well for us. It\u2019s durable (as far a toilet tissue goes), wipes up the poop, and doesn\u2019t leave you feeling \u201craw\u201d. Sorry for the graphic words but we are talking about a good toilet tissue for body waste. :)",
