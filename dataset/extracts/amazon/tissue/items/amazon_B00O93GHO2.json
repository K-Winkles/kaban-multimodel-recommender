It is single ply and falls apart quickly. Even though you'd have to use more squares, that is ok because they still fall apart faster than 2 ply. This will be forever in our back bathroom and RVs now. It's GREAT to have no costly issues anymore! I did not give a good rating for softness and absorbency because it is just thin paper. It does the job fine though! We cannot use the thick cushy stuff.",
