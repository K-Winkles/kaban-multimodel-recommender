It\u2019s pricey and the rolls are small, but the paper itself was quite soft and strong. I was happy! The most recent package felt like a completely different product- much rougher and even the interior cardboard roll was thicker. I thought I had ordered the wrong product. Checked my order- nope, same thing. Checked the reviews and every now and then this is mentioned but I had ignored those reviews initially. I\u2019ll try again once more before looking for another product. If you like to gamble, this is for you! The most recent package is seriously rough. It\u2019s like wiping with cheap paper towels.

They're soft enough. Like somewhere between the big name softy kind & the cheap 1000 sheet kind. Literally they're right up the middle. What's puzzling is their size. I just finished my package but they're small in height & width but that little roll goes on & on & on. I would not mind buying these again. They don't fall apart (on your body) but they do break down in your toilet water. Very important for those of us who have toilets prone to clog or backup. They have no scent or perfumed roll & they're just this no frills little power house! Totally surprised me so if you're in need of TP that gets the job done, then yes go for it. I don't think you'll be disappointed at all. They lasted equally as long as my regular brand just in a smaller size! Kind magical toilet paper \ud83e\uddfb \ud83c\udfa9 \ud83e\ude84",

                "reviewText": "I've now used the leading brand bamboo and bamboo-sugarcane bathroom tissue products offered within the Amazon ecosystem. Bamboo-only NooTrees is excellent toilet paper: Soft enough, absorbent enough, it doesn't irritate, it's priced similarly to bamboo-sugarcane hybrids like Caboo, and like all bathroom tissues made only of bamboo or bamboo-sugarcane, NooTrees is made from wholly sustainable and biodegradable resources.We see consumer reviews poo-pooing the fact these rolls don't last long enough, and that can be situationally true -- the bottom line is this is a three-ply roll, whereas most competitors (like Caboo) tend to be two-ply. When lining up a roll of NooTrees back to back against a roll of Caboo, they're of indistinguishable size thickness-wise. Ultimately, do you want a two-ply roll that will theoretically provide more instances of use (like Caboo), or are you consumer-loyal to 3-ply tissue and can live with the roll maybe not lasting as long (like NooTrees)?There's no doubt this is a great bamboo bath tissue, and it's just as affordable as the competition. Choose wisely!-Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking \"Helpful.\" Cheers!",
