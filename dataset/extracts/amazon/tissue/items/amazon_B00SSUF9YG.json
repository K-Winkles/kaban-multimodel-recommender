I received the product as pictured.So I reordered \u2026what I thought was the exact same product. Including the same design on boxes to match my decor.But received instead animal and flower prints with orange and blue background???Now told it can\u2019t be returned. Why? It\u2019s still sealed. What a waste of money.They should advertise with the current printed boxes.",
