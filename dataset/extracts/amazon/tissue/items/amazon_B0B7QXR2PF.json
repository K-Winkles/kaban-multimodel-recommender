The seller offers a great price, ships fast and is really good. The product is amazing! It's priced well, is very soft yet incredibly strong. No more tearing at that crucial moment! I'll never buy another brand again. SOOO worth it!",

Just wished (unlike some other major brands) they did not shrink the square sizes (rolls are not as tall/long as they used to be a few years ago).",
