With 3 kids in the car we have quite a few tissue issues so I used to keep a regular box in the car. That box never had a good place to stay and would end up getting crushed on longer trips. They stay safely in the cupholder and dispense easily. The tissues are adequate. Not the softest but are work fine for us since we are not too picky. Overall these are pretty good.",

The concern is that you may want to make sure you have spare cup holders including those in the middle, back seats, and on the doors. The quality is good. You may want to give it a try.",
