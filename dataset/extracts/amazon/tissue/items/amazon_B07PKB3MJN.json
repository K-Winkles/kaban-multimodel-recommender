I have smaller than normal hands & in the picture you can see the size of the tissue compared to my hand. I really wish they could make these in a size comparable to a regular size tissue.

                "reviewText": "These tissues are 2-ply but they're also half the size of other tissues. This is like a size you get in a sample pack of something you didn't want in the first place. I opened up one of the packs to see if I would like them, so they are no longer returnable.I'm a big fan of bamboo products but I expected more from these. I can buy a regular size tissue, 2 ply, qty 210 for less than what each package of these would cost individually.Not worth it at all.",
