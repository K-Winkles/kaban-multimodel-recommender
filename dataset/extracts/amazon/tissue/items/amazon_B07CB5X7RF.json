I've tried many brands in search of economy, Cottenelle Ultra Comfort strikes a decent balance between utility and price.A major TP manufacturer advertises 10,000 sheets. I tried those. Way too flimsy, and required the better part of those 10,000 sheets to accomplish cleanliness. Plus, no texture to help abrade features that need to be removed.As the children's book says, everybody poops. With Cottonelle, you can use less paper. Partly from their nice thickness, and partly from their texture. The thickness allows even a slim folding to avoid absorbing all the way to the layer next to your fingers. The texture allows fewer applications.",

                "reviewText": "Well, this is always interesting. How much can be said about toilet paper? Seems a lot going by all the reviews here. That being said, I'll give you mine.I can say I'm usually a Charmin girl. So this was a change, but something I was willing to try. You never know, there might be something better. Amazes me how attached ppl are to their toilet paper brand. But I digress, thought I'd give this a try since my roommate had bought the last TP and it was Cottonelle.First thing I noticed was that, despite the package label that says these 36 rolls are equal to 96, these are NORMAL sized rolls. They fill you with that \"family\" package marking. Don't be fooled, go for the mega rolls, or hit up the local grocery and see what's there so you know what to order.I do have to say that this is a very thick and sturdy paper without sacrificing softness. I felt I could use less paper and had to make a conscious effort to do so. I wanted to see that if by being 3x thicker you use less and therefore the rolls last longer.I can't say if any of my experiments worked to make the rolls last longer. Just have to live with the fact that I bought normal-sized rolls. So, just make sure you pay attention to packaging labels,that's why I removed a star.",

                "reviewText": "Okay let me tell you something. Are you one of those people who LOVE going into public bathrooms? Do you enjoy relieving yourself in close proximity of someone doing the same? Do you think all toilet paper is the same? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you will not enjoy this product!Cottonelle Ultra ComfortCare Toilet Paper reminds you of a better time, a simpler life. CUCCTP, as those in the know refer to it as, brings you back to Momma's house and a time where you didnt have to worry about spending money on trivial items. Now you're an adult, and even though your Bill's may be behind, dont let your behind foot the bill.Treat yourself, you know you deserve it. Use the softest, most plush and absorbent toilet paper on the market. I bring some with me on the go. Some sheets for me and some sheets for a neighbor I may have to share this experience with.Dont make a mistake, this is the toilet paper of the future. Your behind will thank you.",

I thought we should get 2 pkgs, just in case so I ordered from Amazon in case my husband came home without anyThe 2 pkgs I bought came to over $47. I thought they must be huge and would last some time.My husband came home that day with toilet paper that cost $3.99. When my Amazon order came, I was horrified to see the pkgs were SMALLER than the one my husband bought.Maybe Amazon should screen the scammers better. Shame on you, whoever sold at such an inflated price!!!",
