The tissues do not fall apart where your shots end up all over your hands. The tissues are thick enough that you can also reuse it if needed.My whole family ended up having a really bad cold and the tissues lasted us the 8+ weeks. My 2 & 5 year old do not mind the texture and during those 8+ weeks, no one got a raw nose like we have with the other tissue brands.",

                "reviewText": "If bamboo is SO much more readily available, renewable, and sustainable than trees, then why, after ALL these years, does it still cost some exuberant amount of money to get bamboo-made products? Bamboo sanitary products are NOT a new concept. We started buying bamboo products like TP and tissue paper many years ago (At least 6 years now). Firstly, bamboo is a graminaceous plant and it can grow up to 2 feet each day so there is a never-ending abundance of it, It never needs to be \"cut down\" just \"cut back\". Because so many companies are making bamboo products it's not like they ALL need to spend millions of dollars R&Ding how to produce/manufacture it anymore. With all the competition out there now, you would think these highly renewable products would be cheaper, not absurdly more, than products manufactured from destroying trees. If you want to change the world, let's start by acknowledging the greed of these companies first then, we'll talk about doing something GOOD for the planet, not the CEO's and their benefactor's pocketbooks. Till the world of greed changes, I am going to stick with what I can afford... tree-made products.",

                "reviewText": "I like these tissues. I\u2019ve used other brands of bamboo tissues, and these are fairly comparable for softness and strength (no bamboo tissues I\u2019ve tried are comparable in softness to the softest paper tissues). I use multiple tissues a day, and do not find these tissues too rough, and they are strong enough, and have no odor.They are on the pricey side, but I decided to try them because they are one of the few bamboo tissue brands that I could find on Amazon that has paperboard, not plastic, packaging. I looked forward to being able to put the boxes into my paper and cardboard recycling.To my great disappointment, the paperboard packages the Cloud Paper tissues come in have a thin layer of plastic sealed to the top of the paperboard. And the packages are not labeled to indicate whether they are recyclable. Perhaps they *are* recyclable, but plastic that is intermingled in paper that is recycled makes low-quality recycled paper, and toxic substances can cling to plastic, which I believe would degrade the quality of plastic-contaminated recycled paper even more. The cardboard boxes that the tissue boxes are shipped in by Cloud Paper are also sealed with tape that appears to be a paper/plastic composite of some sort.Also disappointing: the ends of at least half of the tissue boxes are only partially sealed (some of the places where the overlapping ends of the boxes were glued together have separated), so if one plans to store unopened boxes in a cupboard that might be visited by bugs or spiders, those small critters would be able to crawl inside the unopened boxes and make nests in them, etc. So if the layer of plastic on the paperboard boxes is meant to protect the boxes from the elements, it\u2019s not doing much to protect the tissues inside the boxes.Finally, I don\u2019t like that Cloud Paper, based in Washington state according to its website, is opaque about where it is getting the bamboo the tissues are made of, let alone where the packaging materials come from. There is nothing on the boxes to indicate the source of the bamboo, nor is there even a mailing address for Cloud Paper. The company\u2019s website says the bamboo comes from responsibly managed forests in areas where bamboo grows natively, which language just strikes me as coy. But the website also says there is no plastic in their packaging, and that the packaging is both recyclable and compostable. So what is the thin plastic layer sealed to the top of the tissue boxes\u2019 paperboard? Is it plastic, even though the website says the packaging has no plastic, or is it some sort of very strong compostable film that is much stronger than compostable trash bags that start to degrade pretty quickly when they get wet? I\u2019ve had a segment of the plastic top layer from one of the tissue boxes sitting in a bowl of water for over 1/2-hour, and it is not noticeably degrading. I don\u2019t know what I should do with the boxes once they\u2019re empty. The website says we can call Cloud Paper if we\u2019re concerned about how to recycle their packaging, and I may do that. But I think the boxes should be labeled to indicate whether and how they are recyclable or compostable, and I think we shouldn\u2019t have to call a supposedly eco-conscious company to find out how to dispose of their tissue boxes, and I think we should be able to trust what the company says on its website.I don\u2019t plan to purchase Cloud Paper products again. Back to searching for another bamboo tissue brand that comes in actual recyclable paper or paperboard packages.",

                "reviewText": "These are a bit softer than the Who Gives a Crap brand, and I like them better. It would be nice if I didn\u2019t have to use two hands to pull out each tissue (one to hold the box and one to pull out the tissue), but regardless of the brand, I think this is a general limitation of using only cardboard for the box without a plastic film around the opening. And plastic-free is better for the environment. You might be able to use a decorative cover around the box to weight it down, but most covers are either square-shaped or designed for taller boxes than these. Either way, the box would probably flop around inside the cover. Maybe put something flat and heavy on the bottom of the cover so the box fits snugly (assuming the cover has a bottom on it). I might look on Etsy for someone to make me a cover with the right dimensions.Overall these tissues are competitive with other bamboo tissues. I would buy them again.",
