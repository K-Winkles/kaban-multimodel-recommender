                "reviewText": "I recently made the switch to eco-friendly bamboo toilet paper, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. Not only does it feel just as soft and comfortable as traditional toilet paper, but knowing that it's better for the environment makes every use feel guilt-free.Considering the rapid rate at which trees are being cut down for paper production, using bamboo, a fast-growing and sustainable resource, feels like a small step towards preserving our forests. Plus, bamboo requires less water and fewer pesticides to grow, making it a more planet-friendly choice.At first, I was concerned about the quality, thinking that eco-friendly options might compromise comfort, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's heartening to know that my purchase is contributing to a greener planet.In conclusion, making the switch to eco-friendly bamboo toilet paper has been a win-win for me. It's as comfortable and effective as traditional options while being much kinder to the environment. I highly recommend giving it a try \u2013 your bum and the planet will thank you!",

The product feels incredibly smooth and isn't \"dusty\" or already falling apart like I've experienced with big brand TP.My main girpe with this product, which seems obvious for a brand trying for \"eco-friendliness\" is there is additional paper waste, each roll being invidually wrapped, plus the chemical dyes used. The wrapping paper is decent quality paper, and could be used for crafts, but I don't personally have time for that. Put 3 into a long unbleached/brown paper bag with a simple plant based ink/branding and I'd be happier.I'm going to try another brand, and if it's significantly worse then I'll go back to this one.",

Sustainable product wrapped in recyclable paper, you can't really go wrong.However the price point for less product is a hard sell for me. As a single person I go through a roll in about a week and a half even though I'm pulling less of the roll, where the other stuff lasts a month. I don't know if I'll buy again, but I have nothing negative to say about the quality of the product itself.",
