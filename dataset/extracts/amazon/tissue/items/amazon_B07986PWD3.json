                "reviewText": "I never thought I would be writing a review for toilet paper. I never really thought about the design of toilet paper when tearing it off of a roll until I saw the wavy smooth tear. When I saw it, I had to try it.When I received the package, I was eager to try it out. I chuckled to myself for getting a little excited about a different way of tearing toilet paper.So far I have had perfect tears every time. No more unsightly uneven sheets. It seems no more wasting paper. The scalloped edge looks better than a straight tear hanging from the roll.Kudos to the design team at Procter and Gamble for making simple, simpler. It is nice to see someone come up with a novel idea without a list of instructions.I have used Charmin ever since I can remember, but I must admit that I have purchased other brands to save money. But I have always come back to Charmin.In my opinion, Charmin is the softest, strongest and most absorbent toilet paper on the market. I don't mind spending a little more money for the great feel it gives my skin.It's a good thing to want to treat yourself to the best. If you haven't used Charmin before, give it a try.",

                "reviewText": "Soft, durable... I had not experienced this before.I have a lot of friends from abroad the US that come visit. They all agree that this toilet paper is incredible and unparalleled in other countries, no matter how much you are willing to pay. One of them, with a nasty case of hemorrhoids even took a couple of rolls back to their home country.It's funny, but it's true.The only possible downside I could think of that may apply to some households is the roll's size. Depending on how your toilet roll holder is designed: If it has a lid or it's too close to the wall, it may not fit. There's a reason they're called \"Mega\".",

                "reviewText": "The price is better than at some places, though Costco has a much better deal. They sell larger packages for only $21. Enough to last my household an entire month. Unfortunately, I moved and haven't been able to find a Costco near here. Next choice with the best value is either here or Walmart. I opted for here because I have prime so I have free delivery. Only TP that is better than Charmin is Kirkland from Costco. Charmin is a close 2nd, though. Nice and soft, but strong enough to not tear or fall apart which means you can use less than how much you need to use for those cheaper brands. If you can't get to Costco for their Kirkland TP, then get Charmin from here. It's your next best value for the money.",
