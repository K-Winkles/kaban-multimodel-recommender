                "reviewText": "I started purchasing Kleenex\u00ae Professional Facial Tissue (21606) because the Kleenex Multi-Care facial tissue was discontinued several years ago. The design pattern and the low-profile of the box is the most similar to the pattern and box of the Multi-Care facial tissue. The only upside is that the Professional Facial Tissue (21606) is made in the USA, while Multi-Care was made in China. This Professional Facial Tissue is fine if you've only ever used a standard Kleenex tissue \u2013\u2013 but for those of us who had the pleasure of enjoying a larger-sized tissue with a box and tissue fold designed so only one tissue was dispensed, we will continue to grieve that the Multi-Care tissue was discontinued. To the manufacturer, Kimberly-Clark Corporation: If Multi-Care was discontinued due to disappointing sales, please consider bringing back the Multi-Care product (tissue size, fold, and box) without the name, just the product description: Large-size facial tissue. For years, I had hesitated purchasing Multi-Care because I thought I would be purchasing something more like a napkin or paper towel. What was a consumer supposed to expect with a name like Multi-Care? I am speculating that you never needed to discontinue Multi-Care; you just needed to delete the name. I am aware that you market a large tissue, but it's in a larger, predominately black box. Please bring back Multi-Care.",
