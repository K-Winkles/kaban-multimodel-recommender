And not having to mess with your black tank is worth any amount of money. Can you get away without using it? Sure, but you had better do the mason jar test (shake TP in half a jar of water) to make sure whatever you are throwing in there is going to dissolve easily (which most likely means stepping down from your fancy TP to a thinner 2-ply or heaven forbid a 1-ply).Anyhow, this is as advertised. Price was better than RV shops, local box store ended up having it slightly cheaper BUT (big but) then I'd have to stand in line behind the unwashed masses who are buying flats of KD and Mr Noodles while their screaming children run wild.",
