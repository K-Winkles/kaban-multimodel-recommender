Who needs 3 or 4 ply? Doesn't anyone think about clogging up the toilet or needing a plumber after so many flushes when using 3 or 4 ply? My mother would have had a fit if anyone clogged her toilet ! My husband too !Why buy 3 or 4 ply when you have several kids at home? You are asking for trouble !I live alone and this package of 4 will last. I never bought more than a 4 pack even when there were 3 of us. Where would l store it?This is a good brand. I am not buying a mattress, needing softness and a cushion of air. This is bathroom tissue.This worked well. Bathroom tissue is just that bathroom tissue. I simply look at the cost and if it is a reliable brand which this is, l buy.",

                "reviewText": "I am extremely pleased with this product and very glad I chose to order such a large amount instead of always getting random brands/packages at my grocery store whenever we run low and just grab whichever is on sale. It worked for awhile, but I can definitely say from here on out, I will be going with this great bundle/deal!Probably the best \"feature\" (for lack of a better word) about getting this large bundle, aside from the great price saving when you calculate price PER squares/plies (which does not even account for the extra thickness causing the need to use much less toilet paper over time)--is that they come bundled together (all 48) BUT then underneath its actually separately wrapped bundles of 12 rolls (so 4 total \"mini\" packages of toilet paper) which is great because it lasts so long (we are a household of 5 (4 adults--grandparents live with us--and one newly potty trained child who of course loves to go overboard with the toilet paper).Being wrapped separately allows me to store one package in the hall closet and its kept nice and clean and protected inside the shrink wrap, and same with the other two (after I unpack one set of 12 to stock up the bathrooms themselves), those other two i can rest assured they are kept dry, clean, and sanitary regardless of wherever i chose to store the other two (right now in our basement, which is very moist but not effecting the TP at all!)Overall, couldnt be happier with purchasing this!! It will be a regularly purchased item for sure!",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Bargain on Quality Toilet Paper (especially with a 15% Subscribe+Save discount)",
                "reviewText": "Summary: The Angel Soft 48 roll pack is the best value I could find on Amazon for a name brand -- especially with a 15% Subscribe + Save discount. It is reasonably soft, but noticeably less soft than Quilted Northern UltraPlush Supreme Rolls -- the closest price competitor I could find (about 17% more costly after adjusting for it's 3 plys). Cottonelle is significantly more expensive, and Charmin was off the charts.Price comparing toilet paper is a constant challenge with the companies doing everything they can to make it difficult. 1. You can't just rely on cost-per-sheet because some companies have been shrinking the size (these Angel Soft and Quilted Northern are still 4\"x4\", but Charmin and Cottonelle are 5% smaller at 3.82\"x4\". 2. You can't rely on simple cost-per-square-foot comparisons because companies vary the number of \"ply\" per sheet (these Angel Soft are 2-ply, some Quilted Northern are 2-ply and some 3-ply, etc). 3. You certainly can't rely simply on the number of rolls, or names like \"Double\", \"Mega\", and \"Super\" because they are meaningless marketing hype representing different numbers in the different brands.. 4. And companies intentionally makes the comparisons hard by hiding the above information -- none of the above-mentioned toilet papers on Amazon display all the necessary information in their bullets or even let you see it in their product pictures -- you often have to research it in the questions and reviews or go to the store (but watch out for different packages that look and sound the same but have different contents).It's very frustrating.I purchased the Angel Soft 48 Double Rolls (4 Packs of 12 Rolls) option which sells for $21.99 (Prime) and contains four sealed packages of 12 Double Rolls each. As noted above, sheets are 4\"x4\" and there are 264 2-ply sheets per roll with 29.33 sq ft/roll. As a cross-check, I did the calculation myself as follows: 4\"x4\" x 264 sheets divided by 144 (to convert to sq feet) = 29.44 (close enough), This is the square footage for 2-ply sheets, which is important if you are comparing it with Northern's UltraPlush which are 3-ply sheets.At $21.99 (Prime) for 48 rolls with a total of 1,408 sq ft, that translates to 1.56 cents per square foot for the 2-ply. Subscribe&Save is 5 or 15% less.By comparison, the next best deal I could find is the Quilted Northern in the Ultra Plush \"Supreme Rolls\". It has 24 rolls of 4\"x4\" with 319 3-ply sheets and 35.4 sq ft per roll. At $23.21 (Prime) for 24 rolls with a total of 850 sq ft, that translates to 2.73 cents per square foot. However, 3-ply sheets are 50% more paper than 2-ply, so adjusting for that difference you get 1.82 cents per sq ft -- about 17% more expensive than the Angel Soft.So the Angel Soft is significantly cheaper than the Quilted Northern UltraPlush (when adjusted for the number of ply), but the Quilted Northern UltraPlush is definitely much softer. Only you can decide if the the extra cost is worth it.Other Quilted Northern options, the Cottenelle, and the Charmin were all more expensive than these -- some by quite a lot. And it's a lot of tedious work to figure it all out. Amazon could do a real service by requiring all of the necessary information -- individual sheet size, sheets per roll, sq ft per roll, and number of ply to be in the bullets, and an even greater service by calculating the true cost per-square-foot per ply for all products for comparison. Unfortunately they don't.I hope this is helpful.",
