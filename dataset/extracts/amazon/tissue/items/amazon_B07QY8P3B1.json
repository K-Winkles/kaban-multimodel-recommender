When I use Bounty to wrap around a fish for storage in the fridge, I can cleanly remove the Bounty later on. With Presto, however, I cannot. I have to peel piece by piece off the fish as the moisture from the fish made the Presto too soft to come off cleanly and in the end I'm not sure if any small piece of Presto is left on the fish.",
