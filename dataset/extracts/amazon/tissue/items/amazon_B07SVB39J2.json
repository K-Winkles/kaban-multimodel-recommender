My major complaint is they are not available on Amazon Subscribe and Save! I spent about 30 minutes today searching Amazon for a comparable Subscribe and Save product and couldn't find one. Although it seems ridiculous that a toilet paper! product is not subscribable, I'm going to keep buying this item every month as I could find no comparable quality at the same price.",

I don't know where you can even buy tp that bad, but they somehow found it didn't they?ANGEL SOFT! It is good toilet paper, and... that's... just... great...",

                "reviewText": "Overall great value for the price. Not sure what other reviews were saying regarding the thickness and absorbency of the product.... what do you want, a towel? It's standard toilet paper. I'm not overly picky with toilet paper but am definitely not a fan of the thin varieties found in hospitals or schools. This brand in my opinion falls right in the middle between the thin, hospital type and Charmin. I feel like I used one roll maybe every two weeks or so (only one person, female, doesn't use 20 squares of TP every time using the washroom, but uses washroom maybe 5 times a day?) Doesn't rip easily and has a pretty good absorbency. I would definitely buy this again.",
