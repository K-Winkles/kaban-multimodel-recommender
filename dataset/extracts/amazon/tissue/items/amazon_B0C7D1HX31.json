                "reviewText": "I purchased these because they're described as refillable and thought they'd be perfect in the doors of the car. Unfortunately they arrived crushed. This was not due to handling but because they're not made from sturdy cardboard tubing but instead from flimsy card stock. And though designed for refill and reuse they are simply too flimsy to survive long enough for refilling. I'm going to back engineer using the sturdy plastic caps with trimmed to size mailing tubes. I'll decorate the outside with decorative paper or acrylic paints so I'll still get some practical use from them...",
