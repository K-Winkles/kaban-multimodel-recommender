As someone who is environmentally conscious, I love that these tissues are made from bamboo, a sustainable and renewable resource.The tissues themselves are soft and durable, and they don't irritate my sensitive skin like some other tissues do. They're also very convenient to carry around in my purse or pocket for whenever I need them.I appreciate that the packaging is also eco-friendly and minimalistic, with no unnecessary plastic or excess materials.Overall, I highly recommend these bamboo pocket tissues to anyone who wants to make a positive impact on the environment while still enjoying a quality product. Five stars!",
