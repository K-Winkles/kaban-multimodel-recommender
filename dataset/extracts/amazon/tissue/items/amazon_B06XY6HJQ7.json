                "reviewText": "These reusable cotton cloths are soft enough to use on one's face, but the absorbency needs work. I've used them with micellar water to remove makeup, and they do fairly well. They can be handwashed, dried, and used again, so they are economical. The real issue is if one wants to use them for cleaning. They aren't large enough for any medium to large areas. I can use them to clean a smaller surface, such as a bathroom mirror. If you cleaned a surface with a product that requires a wipe-down to dry it, the absorbancy is mediocre at best. I plan to continue to use them for makeup removal, as they are good for that.",
