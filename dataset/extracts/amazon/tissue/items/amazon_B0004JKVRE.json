It is a pretty good tissue and of course does the job, but it could be a little softer. I have found another brand of facial tissue that is environmentally friendly called Cascades and I find it is much softer, and they have very pretty boxes which is always a plus. It would be nice if Amazon.ca would carry the brand \"Cascades\" as they make great products. But overall, this purchase is a good one since the environmental impact is much, much lower than conventional tissues and it makes me happy no chlorine is being dumped into our oceans!",
