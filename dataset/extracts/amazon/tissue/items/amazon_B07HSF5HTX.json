However, the next day it starts all over again..Puffs Plus is the #1 selling Lotion Tissue, I have read. It is true that they are soft and feel cushiony. They seem to soothe my irritated nose, no stiff tissues to scrape my nares, but soft tissues. In this package I have 10 boxes of tissues, true the boxes of tissues seem to be fewer than previously, but the info says there are 52 tissues to each box.They feel soft to my nose. They are sturdy, so these tissues are the ones I turn to.Recommended. prisrob 12-17-18",

I\u2019m one of those moms who buys 3 or 4 different brands of the same household items in one shopping trip, just to compare the quality. I keep coming back to Puffs tissues. Even tried a couple of other brands that also had lotion in them. Still settled on Puffs. Even my husband agrees that the tissues with the lotion in them really do make a difference. As I write this, I am just recovering from a very nasty cold, the only thing worse than this monster cold would have been the flu. The whole bottom half of my face was chapped from a runny nose and watery eyes. These puffs made a big difference. I should know because I used a different brand while away from home and my face paid for it, flared up redder than before. I just want to say how grateful I am for the affordable Amazon Subscriptions because a fresh box of these arrived at my door just as I was about to run out, and I had forgotten all about them.",
