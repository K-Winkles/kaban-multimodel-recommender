                "reviewText": "I bought these by mistake. I thought I was buying the name brand tissue and didn't realize what these were. They are not quite as soft as the name brand tissues, nor as large; but they turned out to be awesome in the car or in places where you don't really want the tissue box to show\u2014like behind our chair in the corner by the sliding glass doors. I am pretty sure that when we use them up I will re-purchase these just for those situations. They would also be good for people who do not want to waste extra paper, as they are perfectly adequate for wiping runny noses.",
