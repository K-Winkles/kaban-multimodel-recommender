                "reviewText": "I am a Kleenex brand tissue user only. I purchased these from Amazon when my local retailers had been out for quite a bit longer than was convenient. What I really like about this particular iteration of Kleenex products is that they are soft they are sturdy, and very absorbent. But perhaps, the best quality of all is that they don\u2019t shred into little tiny pieces when you forget you had one in your pocket and it goes through the wash. Yes, you will be removing pieces of tissue from your clothes, but they are large pieces, and easy to just pull off and throw away. One thing that I don\u2019t like, and it\u2019s a total personal preference, is the new design on the boxes. They are very cutesy, and tropical, with bright colors, and birds and flowers, and that is not my aesthetic. And if the last design is any indication, they will keep this one for years. I keep Kleenex boxes in every room of the house, and I would rather have them blend in and be neutral, then be some thing that stands out as a conversation piece. I understand why they don\u2019t, but I definitely wish there were more choices of types of patterns. But you can\u2019t go wrong with Kleenex brand tissues.",

                "reviewText": "I wish all packs came with 1 of each design. Instead, it's a gamble as to what you'll get. Why would Kleenex not pack 4 pack package with 1 of each design. I got one pack with 3 of same design and 1 of another. I got one pack with all 4 of same design. I'm not happy at all. But the tissues are still soft and usable.",
