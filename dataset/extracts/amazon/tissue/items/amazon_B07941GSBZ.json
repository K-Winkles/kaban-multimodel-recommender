It's easy to see why Caboo is a smart choice when you compare that to the years of time it takes for tree paper to break down fully.

More trees means better air, water, habitat and chance to combat climate change. We believe most people want to do better by the Earth. But where to start? We started Caboo: two brothers, a wife and a friend. Wiping out forests along with a spill or a bum just didn't make sense to us. So we figured it out, building relationships with trusted farmers, retailers and folks along the way. Ten years and two kids later, we're even more committed to making tree-free the go-to. Daily decisions like choosing Caboo do make a difference. We and the forest thank you! The paper industry clear cuts 1,000,000 acres of North American boreal forest each year. While trees may be replanted (and re-cut) the forest is gone forever. But, Trees Grow Too, Right? Yes, but the complex ecosystem that is a forest is gone forever. A forest is biodiverse. Over time, it is populated by different species of plants, animals and other living things at all stages of growth. They depend on each other, creating a complex ecosystem our climate depends on. It can't be replicated. Big Paper basically replants tree farms: only 1 or 2 species of the fastest growing trees all planted at once so they can get cut down again. This is why tree-free matters. How is Caboo a more Earth-conscious choice than recycled paper? Bamboo and Sugarcane are grasses, not hardwoods. They both grow very quickly and, after harvest, grow back just as quickly. No replanting is necessary. Unlike trees, which can take up to 30 years to grow and mature, bamboo and sugarcane grow back as quickly as in three to four months. When a tree is cut, it never grows back. How Caboo gives back. It's not just the trees impacted. Bamboo vs. Trees Tree-Free > Reused Tree Paper",

                "reviewText": "Bamboo is a strong, effective, and eco-friendly alternative to tree-based paper products. The company also seems to have ethical standards on sourcing/recycling their (bamboo) resources, which helps promote natural resource conservation (i.e., not excessively destroy swaths of forest to replace with a monocrop).The tissues are quite strong and absorbent -- to be expected for a strong fiber source like bamboo. The value is in its effectiveness and current eco-friendlier application. Although relatively expensive now, the price may reduce if the use/demand for bamboo or more sustainable products increase...subsequentially lowering the demand/use for tree-based papers.The only downside is that these tissues are not the softest in comparison to other products. However, the manufacturers' other bamboo products (e.g., toilet paper) are competitively soft. Perhaps continued feedback can inform an adaptive process to generate more softness while maintaining an otherwise effective product.",

                "reviewText": "I agree with \"funnyworm\" and \"honestopinion\": I used to spend more on Cabboo tissues for three reasons and now two have gone down in 2023. First, I was willing to pay more (compared to a competitor, see below) for the attractive green boxes with nice bamboo \"wallpaper\" pattern; well, that's gone now, replaced with yellow (sorry, not my favorite color) and what appears to be toddler's stuffed animals' graphics. Second, the quantity per box (184) meant that I didn't have to change the boxes as often; now it's down to 160. Third is still fine, I like the rationale for the product and I actually prefer the stiffness and lack of perfumes relative to the major brands. I'm gonna switch to the other bamboo brand that is essentially the same product but a better value (hint: terrible name rhymes with \"leaky\" and has a mascot that is endangered in China.)",
