                "reviewText": "got to say, I have just been a lucky shopper lately Lol. First and foremost, everybody has been so helpful in their reviews. It has really helped me make better buying decisions this Holiday Shopping Season. I decided I wanted to make sure I left detailed feedback on some of the purchases I made in the Fall; with the hopes that I might help someone else. I thought I was going to be leaving the good the bad the ugly. But, I can't find a bad thing to say about these disposable hand towels. When I decided that I wanted something like this, for bedside; I was thinking of it, as a luxury purchase, paper towels dispensed one at a time, fancy. It turned out, that right from the beginning, this pack of 6 individual boxes of the Kleenex Expressions hand towels in the one at a time box, was a good value. When they arrived and I started using them, I realized just what a gem I had found. These are amazing. They truly are a 3 in 1 product. They are as durable as any premium paper towel on a roll I have ever used. So, they work great wet, as a cleansing cloth. They're very absorbent, one towel dries your hands and forearms thoroughly without falling apart. They have this stretch to them & are perfect for holding a sandwich or some chips. Sometimes, I hate to throw them away, the hold up so well. After using them to hold a snack, I'll often rinse my hands when I'm done eating, dry them with the same towel, & then take the damp towel and wipe down my tablet. Absolutely lint free glass cleaning! That's use number 2 or 3 and why they would be amazing in the woodshop or the car! Thirdly, and this is the best part for me, they are crazy soft. I got a 6 pack of tissues at the same time I ordered these, but these towels are truly just as soft as these tissues. I absolutely love that. I have been forever looking to find a tissue that could hold up to being used like a napkin, when the need arises, in the car or the bedside or kids room. But, wow, a sturdy, lint free paper towel, that is as soft and gentle on my delicate nose, a paper napkin, that IS as soft as a tissue, is eve even better. I know I am going to be obnoxious about trying to get my family to try these. But I can't help it I always thought it was a problem to solve (tissue falls apart / paper napkins are rough) and now I've found a solution. SO far so good with not irritating my sensitive skin, but it is early days for that. SO, I will update about that when I've gone through a few boxes. This box is lasting me a long time. I keep thinking I am finding excuses and using too many. But that just goes to show you go through towels that can't do the job much faster. I have medical issues and spend a lot of time in my bedroom, so those are great uses for me. I would say the average household would love these in the bathroom, where you guests and family can pull out just one clean towel after washing their hands. They don't need to touch a hand towel and the don't need to contaminate a whole role of paper towels trying to get one. SO great for kitchen, bathrooms, laundry rooms, nurseries and my favorite place bedside. But, be warned once your guests have felt how soft they are, they'll be reaching over the tissue box and grabbing one of these if they feel a sneeze coming on.",

                "reviewText": "Kleenex Expressions Disposable Paper Hand Towels have been a game-changer in my household, especially with the chaos of kids and constant germ spreading. These little wonders are like superheroes in the battle against germs. They offer convenience with a friendly touch, ensuring a quick cleanup without the hassle of constantly laundering hand towels. Let me repeat, to those busy Moms out there: no more constant laundering of those dirty hand, kitchen, or bathroom towels!What's truly remarkable is how (PSA: in my opinion only) they limit the spread of germs. It's like having a secret weapon against those invisible invaders. When friends and all the neighbor kids constantly are running in and out of our house, I feel more confident in maintaining a clean environment.With the caveat of a higher price tag, the peace of mind and the reduced risk of illnesses circulating in the house is priceless. Plus, the stylish designs on the towels add a touch of flair to the otherwise mundane task of hand drying. If you're looking for a practical and effective solution to minimize hand towel washing and maximize clean hands all around, these disposable paper hand towels are worth every penny. Highly recommended for households where hygiene and convenience are top priorities!",

                "reviewText": "I have enjoyed having these hand towels throughout our home in every bathroom, but they have been really helpful in the guest bathroom. These are so much better than regular hand towels that lead to cross contamination. I typically only use 1 towel per use and they are fairly absorbent.My only complaint is that sometimes it\u2019s hard to get the first towel started when opening a new box. Sometimes you end up grabbing more than one towel - I wish they made it a bit easier for the first towel to release from the box. I also wish they had more box designs to match seasons or decor, but that\u2019s a minor issue.",

Thicker than I expected, smaller than a kitchen paper towel, easier to handle than a roll of towels. I'm not a big paper-towel user in the kitchen, preferring washable towels, placemats and napkins. But surprisingly, I love these paper towels for the bathroom. Initially purchased for guests, it's a handy option when I need something disposable. I will probably buy again. I only wish they came in less obnoxious colors (half point off for that!)",
