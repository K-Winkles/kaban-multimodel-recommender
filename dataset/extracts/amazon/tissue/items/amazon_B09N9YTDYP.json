                "reviewText": "I'm going to suggest looking closer than I did because I just researched How many Kleenex should be in a new box? I saw different results but this one has the Least number at 45 so I'm kind if crabby because I just opened a box and, granted I use more than most people I've never gone through a whole box this fast and it finally dawned on me so I got an unopened box and it really did feel almost empty. I've never experienced this before but am unsure if I've just never purchased this exact bulk package before or if they have started selling them with fewer tissues per box? THESE have 45 which isn't that many really. The ones I saw when comparing had 56 or 65 tissues per box and I only compared this to other Kleenex Brand tissues but with a different designs on the box (I liked them better) This only applies to the Kleenex Corp & this is just my perspective: This design is bright colorful & pretty but it's a bit difficult to blend them in with a majority of my interiors which are pretty colorful. A teeeeeny bit more neutral would be my suggestion but don't get me wrong here. I think the design is pretty. Love Kleenex & am very close to going through a box in 5 days & I've got a box here & there, maybe 6' apart (2 small rooms) and they run out simultaneously! Aaaachoo! Bless You",
