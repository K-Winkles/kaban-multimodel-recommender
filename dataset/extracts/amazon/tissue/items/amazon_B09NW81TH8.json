I have even used this as Kleenex in a pinch for when I had a cold and my nose was really sore.. .and .. happy to say\u2026 no irritation and very absorbent..Things to improve on: the mega rolls don\u2019t fit the regular toilet roll dispenser but..There is something called a Charmin Roll Extender that might help. See image \ud83d\ude0aI agree with the below posted review:ORIGINAL REVIEWIntroduction:In the realm of bathroom essentials, few items are as vital as toilet paper. With a plethora of options available, Angel Soft Toilet Paper aims to stand out as a beacon of comfort, quality, and convenience. In this epic review, we'll unravel the merits of the Angel Soft 16 Mega Rolls, exploring its softness, durability, and overall performance to determine if it truly deserves a spot as your go-to bathroom companion.Softness (5/5):Angel Soft lives up to its name, delivering an unparalleled level of softness that transforms the mundane task of toilet paper into a luxurious experience. The texture is gentle on the skin, providing a velvety touch that feels like a spa retreat for your most sensitive areas. The sheets are thick enough to inspire confidence in their durability but maintain a delicate feel that elevates the overall bathroom experience.Durability (4.5/5):With 16 Mega Rolls in one package, Angel Soft proves it's not just about softness but also about endurance. The rolls are generously sized, ensuring longevity and reducing the frequency of replacements. The toilet paper holds up well during use, minimizing the risk of tearing or disintegration. While it may not be as robust as some ultra-thick varieties, it strikes a commendable balance between durability and comfort.Absorbency (4.5/5):One of the standout features of Angel Soft Toilet Paper is its impressive absorbency. The sheets effectively handle moisture, providing a clean and refreshing experience with each use. Whether for routine tasks or unexpected situations, this toilet paper offers reliable performance, giving you peace of mind in the most critical moments.Value for Money (4/5):The 16 Mega Rolls packaging not only ensures longevity but also offers value for money. While the upfront cost may seem higher than smaller packages, the reduced frequency of repurchasing makes it a cost-effective choice in the long run. Additionally, the quality of the paper justifies the price, as each use feels like a premium experience.Sustainability (4/5):In an era where environmental consciousness is paramount, Angel Soft doesn't disappoint. The toilet paper is made from responsibly sourced materials, and the packaging is designed to minimize waste. While it may not be the most eco-friendly option on the market, it strikes a reasonable balance between quality and sustainability.Conclusion:Angel Soft Toilet Paper, in its 16 Mega Rolls glory, emerges as a triumphant contender in the competitive world of bathroom essentials. With its heavenly softness, commendable durability, and overall value for money, it establishes itself as a top-tier choice for those who prioritize comfort without compromising practicality. Elevate your bathroom experience to new heights with Angel Soft, where each roll is not just a necessity but a small indulgence in everyday luxury.",

As for softness, the tissue is comfortable and non-irritating but it's not the softest. The price and absorbency are the important things though. This pack will last a while because I don't have to use a lot every time to get the job done.",

We have an old house though with cast iron pipes and when the grandkids come over, they use too much paper in the one bathroom that occasionally has issues so I've had to switch to 1000 paper in that one (what plumbers recommend in our area) but it works great in the other bathroom. It's usually not a problem. Hubby hates the 1000 lol but he likes this one.",
