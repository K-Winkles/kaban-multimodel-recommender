I definitely don\u2019t enjoy stuffing tissues in my pockets that end up getting on my cards or money from little pieces that have detached. Having these is very convenient because they don\u2019t make a mess in any of your pockets. Currently, I have a pack in a few coats, my work bag, my glove compartment (for times I want to take them with me when I don\u2019t have my jacket or somebody in the car wants tissues for on the go), and my kids take them in their book bags. These are very convenient. The different color plastic wrappings are just a cute extra. I like that so many came in the bulk package because similar items like these are unreasonably priced in stores while this bulk package was a great deal. I know I\u2019ll need these on and off during winter but will break them back out again during parts of the spring when the pollen is out of control \ud83e\udd27!The only con I have is a about the softness. I\u2019m used to very soft tissues and when you get to the point where you have to use many of these, it will bother your nose!",
