                "reviewText": "I use tissues all freaking day long -- for allergies, makeup, blotting excess chapstick, you name it. I can't tell you how many times I've wished for a travel-style tissue pack that I could toss in my suitcase when going on vacation, or keep in my car's glove box, etc., that would actually hold a decent number of tissues. This might sound crazy to the tissue manufacturers of the world, but sometimes, people actually want to have more than 10 tissues on hand, but also don't want to lug around an entire cardboard box of them that doesn't fit anywhere. Crazy stuff, I know.This product is exactly what I've been looking for. One pack of these easily lasted an entire week when I went on vacation recently, and I've kept another pack in my car and the third on my desk at work. The tissues are soft (though I've never been especially fussy about tissue softness and never purchase the ones that come with added lotion or whatever, so if that kind of thing is important to you please take my opinion with a grain of salt), and don't feel especially thin or cheap even though they're only 1-ply. I never had them rip on me unexpectedly or anything. The portability-to-quantity ratio is perfect, and as far as I'm concerned, this is a new travel necessity for me. Unfortunately, until Kleenex and Puffs get it through their heads that us uncultured American tissue consumers might like to see these on our store shelves as well, I'm stuck buying these Korean ones through Amazon, I guess. At least the packaging is cute.",
