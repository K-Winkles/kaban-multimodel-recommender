                "reviewText": "I mean, they're soft tissues, pretty much what you'd expect, except for one thing: they're VERY heavily perfumed. I can't imagine why. At first I thought it was just the one box, that maybe it was sitting in the Amazon facility next to some perfume. But I had bought four boxes, and all of them had that same overwhelming smell, and it wasn't from anything that I bought. There's supposedly no lotion, so I don't know what the smell is from. And worse, it's the kind of perfume that makes your nose tickle and makes you feel like you need to sneeze, which is counter-productive for a tissue. In all other respects it works the way a tissue should, but I don't think I'll be ordering tissues from Amazon Fresh in the future.",
