                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Bottoms prefer this 13:1 over bargain brands -your rear (& wallet) will thank your brain for this TP (great value/great product)",
                "reviewText": "One can only write so much about TP...or can they?While I do not claim to be an expert on many topics, I consider myself the foremost expert in the field of toilet paper technology, research, development, and (especially) testing. While I do not have a doctorate in T-Paperology, I do have Crohn's Disease (as does my brother). Take it from me...if you have IBD, you know TP!In the historical perspective, you have to be appreciative of the guy or gal who decided years ago that there was a better way than banana leaves or yesterday's newspaper (or, in very unfortunate circumstances, the hand you like less). But since that ever so ingenious creation, we've seen an explosion of brands and kinds of so called \"end-wiping-apparatuses,\" or just \"TP\" to the masses. Is all TP made equal? Take it from me my friends; it is most certainly NOT!Let me be blunt (and rather uncivilized)...no one likes bargain TP. Not only are you left with poop on your bottom, but now you are left with poopoo and shards of TP, and in the end you wind up using a ton more TP than you would a nice brand. Plus, most bargain TP isn't even very soft, so now you are left with poopoo and shards of TP shrapnel on your bottom. If 'it's rough, tough, and no wipe poopoo off butt', then it's no good!Enter the world of nicer TP that most surveys of sound methodology suggest that bottoms prefer no less than 13:1 over bargain brands. They are softer, stronger, require less usage in quantity, and ultimately do a better job of removing the byproducts upon producing waste product. This Quilted Northern most certain fits the bill.But the nicer brands like Charmin or Quilted Northern...yeah\u2026while your butt-butt loves them, your wallet-butt has reservations as they are not cheap. Enter Amazon with this ridiculously large vat of Quilted Northern. The price is reasonable, the quality is excellent, the packaging is great (6 per individual packing). I generally get two at a time and then don\u2019t have to worry about TP for the better part of a year. The price savings over buying in smaller quantity is incredible, and it\u2019s not that hard to put a few boxes in a closet with the gain of saving money and always having good TP when you need it. And believe me\u2026if you are human, you WILL need it and there is nothing you can do to change it.So should you buy the full 48ct box? You should buy two, at least. Your butt-butt and your wallet-butt both concur that this is the smart move in life.So to recap, why would you want to buy this large quantity of TP?1) This is good TP-it is strong, thick, holds its form when wet, and very soft despite being strong2) Save money \u2013 this is normally expensive TP and this allows you to get it for a very reasonable price3) Reduce the chance of running out of TP - short of an obsolete satellite crashing through your living room during the last 60 seconds of the Super Bowl, this is the worst possible scenario a person can encounter4) It won't go out of style - you won't stock up only to find \u201cTP 5s\u201d is released a month later and this \u201cs\u201d version now makes your current supply obsolete5) The demand for this product is predictableFinally, I would like to dispel a myth I erroneously believed for many years. Contrary to popular belief held by the male human species, girls DO poop. For many years, I believed what I was told by the nice young ladies in my 2nd grade class, which was the only byproduct females produce is a nice lavender scent and that the only reason the ladies room existed was for socialization purposes and to escape annoying male counterparts who simply refused to give up on their unsuccessful attempts at impressing a member of the opposite sex with conventional and unconventional practices. But after growing up, I have come realize that this is actually an urban myth. So when stocking up on your TP, PLEASE take this into account. I made this mistake initially and my girlfriend was very unhappy with me.",

                "reviewText": "This item is Quilted Northern Ultra Plush, 24 Supreme (90+ Regular) Bath Tissue / Toilet Paper Rolls ( Toilet Paper Quilted Northern Ultra Plush, 24 Supreme (90+ Regular) Bath Tissue Rolls )24 Mega rolls x 319 3-play sheets per roll= 22,968 single layer sheets (90 regular rolls) / $22.79 = 1,007.81 single layer sheets per $1For comparison sake, here are a couple of other options on Amazon that are also very good deals...1) Angel Soft Bath Tissue, 48 Double Rolls Toilet Paper, Angel Soft Bath Tissue, 48 Double Rolls Toilet Paper, 12 Count (Pack of 4) 48 Double Rolls x 264 2-ply sheets per roll = 25,344 single layer sheets (96 regular rolls) / $21.99 = 1,152.52 single layer sheets per $12) Angel Soft Bath Tissue, 36 Mega Rolls Toilet Paper Angel Soft Bath Tissue, 36 Mega Rolls Toilet Paper 36 Mega rolls x 528 2-ply sheets per roll = 38,016 single layer sheets (144 regular rolls) / $26.39 = 1,440.55 single layer sheets per $1How do these compare? Well, even though both of the Angel Soft toilet papers you would think should \"feel\" the same because only the size of the rolls are different, that isn't the case in my current testing. The Mega Roll sheets feel somewhat thinner than the Double Roll sheets. Furthermore, I think I prefer the feel of the Double Roll sheets, perhaps because they feel thicker, if not \"softer\".The prices I have above is what I saw when I was comparing here on Amazon before I purchased these three different items.All of that said, based on the price comparison, the Quilted Northern is the worst deal based on the amount of toilet paper you get for your money, but I think it is actually better quality toilet paper. It certainly feels a bit more soft or \"premium\".Again, this Quilted Northern Ultra Plush Supreme Roll bundle might not be as cheap or as good of a deal, but I do prefer it a bit more over the Angel Soft Double Roll or Mega Roll bundles. If price is priority, the Angel Soft or other options might be better, but I think this Quilted Northern bundle is a nice compromise between price and quality, especially if you are getting a good price/deal on it. Overall, I would say it deserves 4 or 4 1/2 stars, but I'll be nice and round up to 5 stars.",

                "reviewText": "Este papel parece tela, tiene una textura MUY suave, el grosor y absorbencia no tiene comparacion con cualquier otra marca. Es incluso superior al de otras marcas premium como Kirkland (de costco) o Members Mark (sams). El resto de las marcas como Regio, charmin, cotonell, petalo.... ni siquiera podrian compararse ya que o son muy caras, muy corrientes, y/o tienen perfume (a quien se le ocurre!).La marca Kirkland de costco es el rival mas cercano en cuanto a calidad del material. De hecho creo que en lo personal no voy a volver a ordenar este articulo (Quilted Northern) y regresare a la marca de costco porque:1.- Amazon le ha retirado el envio gratuito a este articulo. Ahora el envio cuesta cientos de pesos!.2.- Incluso con el envio gratuito, este papel es mas costoso que el kirkland.Con $400 pesos que se paga por estos 48 rollos obtienes 858.32 metros de papel. Cada metro muy rendidor porque la hoja es triple.Con $250 pesos que se paga por el paquete de 30 rollos kirkland, obtienes 863.60 metros de papel. aunque estos rinden menos porque la hoja es doble.3.- Cada \"cuadrito\" del producto kirkland es ligermanete mas ancho 11.4cm x 10.16cm. El cuadrito de la marca Quilted Northern mide 10.16 cm x 10.16 cm.En fin, mientras que este papel es claramente superior en lo que respecta a calidad del material, esto quizas no justifica para mi el extra que se paga por este producto. Especialmente ahora que amazon no lo envia gratis en compras de $599 o mas.Pero si esa promocion de envio gratuito regresa, y no quieres/puedes comprar en sams o costco, entonces definitivamente merece pagar ese \"premium\" extra por este papel.",
