The tissue packaging is not only adorable, but so thin that it could be placed in smaller areas out of sight. They don\u2019t take up much room and can be used for anything. In terms of the actual tissue - the Kleenex is kinda rough, so if you\u2019re using it for wiping/blowing your nose I\u2019d advise against it only because it feels like sandpaper being swiped across your face. These are made more for heavy spills or even wedding \u201chappy tears\u201d tissues. It comes with a pack of 30, but it\u2019s more like 60 because each pack has two sides of tissues. Overall, a solid 5/5 is given due to the small compact each thing holds.",
