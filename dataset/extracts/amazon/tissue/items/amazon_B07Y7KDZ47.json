After trying a few popular brands I settled on Reel and used it for a few months. However, while it\u2019s strong and absorbent, it\u2019s not softest and does leave a little lint behind. Since Betterway is extremely popular on Amazon, I decided to give it a try. To my surprise, it\u2019s notably softer than Reel. Of course bamboo toilet paper will never be as soft or cushy as Charmin, but Betterway is absorbent, cleans well, is comfortable to use and is almost lint free. I doubt any toile paper can be totally lint free. Best of all, NO trees are cut down to make it, the rolls are wrapped in pretty paper, and it\u2019s shipped in a cardboard box. No plastic!!!",

                "reviewText": "Let's start with why I purchased this TP. I purchased 12 regular sized rolls. The giant, soft, fluffy, TP form Costo was shedding paper fuzz that stuck in places where it did not belong, and caused intolerable irritation. After 2 -3 weeks of use, the Betterway TP has eliminated that problem. After having used the giant costco sized packages of TP that filled the trunk of my car, the size of the box and rolls that arrived were shockingly small in comparison. My first thought was that I'm not going to be able to afford it in the long term. The good news is that this TP goes a long way. One bamboo roll lasts as long as two of the giant fluffy paper rolls, but I am using it sparingly. There is a smooth soft side, which is soft enough and sufficiently absorbent. It does break down quickly when wet and holds up better with dabbing rather than wiping. The textured side for messier cleanups reminds me of textured paper towels. It does work better than smooth TP, but it can be rough and uncomfortable, if too much pressure is applied, but the softer side is always an available option. These rolls/sheets are not wide enough for me with my bigger than average behind. The attached photo shows a roll on a standard 5-1/2\" wide TP holder that could accommodate another 1.75\" in width. One would think that using a longer length would make up the difference, but I find it is more of a challenge than a wider sheet. I do have a septic tank so I was happy to see that it claims it is septic tank safe, and I can see that it breaks down easily. I will continue to buy this unless cost becomes an issue. I do hope that a wider width is available in the future",

No, it's not ever going to be as soft as regular toilet paper, but I find that's better than having too many fibres that can irritate and get stuck on sensitive areas. My only issue is that the prices tripled since I bought my last pack on June 2021 at $24CA and now its $75CA. On their US site its also showing up at ridiculous prices. Has bamboo become scarce? No longer growing? Whaaa happeeeen??Anyway, the branding is amazing too. Had me chuckling at a lot of the puns. Everything from their website to the packaging and down to the end of the roll - just brilliant.",

So while there are 300 or 360 of these per roll, they've reduced each piece size. I think people should be aware. Good product but way way too expensive.",
