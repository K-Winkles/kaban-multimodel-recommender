                "reviewText": "I was excited to receive my order, until I opened the first canister. There is a strange and pungent chemical smell that emits from the inside and also on the tissue. The best I can describe it, it reminds me of formaldehyde. After a few minutes the smell dissipates. The tissues are small and scratchy. As I write this, I have decided to return. Each time I would use these, that smell...it's not worth it. Great concept, though.",

They are sturdy enough to take care of the job they\u2019re meant to do, for sure! I like that they come in a pretty container not just a regular box. It sets them apart from the same old, same old! They can fit nicely into your car mug holder, if you\u2019re not drinking two cups of coffee! I would recommend them and will most likely purchase them again! Also, they arrived in record time before the expected date! Thank you! Cheers \ud83d\ude0aUpdate: Yes now the container is empty! It would be nice to purchase a refill rather than having to dispose of the container and fill up the land fill.Since I first purchased them, the price has more than doubled!!! I would not buy them again at the current price!!!",
