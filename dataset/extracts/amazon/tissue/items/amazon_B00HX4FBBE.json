                "reviewText": "Bought a box of this during the Tolet Paper craze/shortage earlier this year. IT WAS ALL I COULD FIND IN STOCK, and I actually NEEDED TP we were nearly out!!Fast forward several months later, I still have several rolls left even after giving some to friends in need.But I am actively using it I didn't set it aside.Its no charmin ultra soft, but its much better than most public restrooms offer.Pros- Individually wrapped in paper wraps. wads up small and takes up minimal space in the trashcan and more eco friendly than plastic wrap. Also allows you to put these things anywhere small for storage as they have *some* protection vs non at all like the bulk plastic-wrapped charmin- its \"good enough\" grade/softness. Its not sand paper hard like a public restroom but its no luxury softness like a charminComplains are in line with what many others have said- Rolls are small/short so you are replacing them much more often than a typical charmin roll.- Squares are smaller so you will likely use 1-2 more than you might normally grab which will leave you feeling confused the first few times you grab for it.- It does have a tendency to delayer? delaminate? not sure what you would call it.. it the sheets will tend to separate from each other, something you normally don't see from a premium brand. But its still soft.",

                "reviewText": "Yeah I thought these would be closer to the commercial rolls of TP I've previously purchased in bulk boxes like this - Like sturdy/dense rolls that last a while and don't fall apart...NOPE! These are SUPER THIN, LOOSELY rolled tubes/rolls. We'll probably go through 1 in a day or so...SAD! These are the quality of the 0.25 cent roll bargain brand at WM or $1 store...but I paid over DOUBLE that! What a rip-off!! Should have stuck to my fav brand and paid 0.10 to 0.15 cents more/roll! Lesson learned!!",
