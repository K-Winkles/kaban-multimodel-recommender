Feeling the texture when I first bought it, I wondered, but my wife and I both love it now for several reasons: 1) If you tear off a longer strip than usual for ordinary two ply, it is actually MUCH more effective...a wad of it contours much better and it's strong enough to wipe well and does not leave fragments on you 2) no perfume 3) no risk of clogs or septic problems (if you're on septic...we're on sewer) 4) a real BIGGIE: Does not leave lint all over everything in the bathroom. Safer, you're not breathing lint, and far less messy than the fluffy stuff. 5) a roll lasts MUCH longer than the two ply stuff...especially the fluffy two ply stuff.It may take a week or two to get used to it, but when you do you won't want to use the regular junk again if you care about the issues I listed!",

                "reviewText": "Thin, lightweight, single ply. If you don't want your toilet clogged, use this. It is NOT soft and fluffy and does not create a small pile of lint on the floor underneath the TP holder. I don't know why people complain about this paper? I grab enough of it until I have a wad in my hand that feels like it will be enough. I recently filled my toilet with this paper so I could test out a new plunger. I could NOT clog the toilet and I used tons of it and was really trying to create a clog. I was not able to test the plunger. The entire bowl looked like I used almost an entire roll. If you do that with fluffy papers, you will absolutely have a clog. Being this is single ply, the paper starts to disintegrate as soon as it hits the water, so no clog. This should be sold by weight so people could make a fair comparison to any other paper they are using or considering. All TP's have different sized sheets and plys. The only thing left is the weight of the roll to make a comparison, at least for price. In my small household of 2, one roll will last 1-2 weeks. Each full roll weighs anywhere from 5.7 - 6 ozs. after weighing about 10 rolls, most are 5.9Some people will receive an embossed paper with an imprinted pattern and others are flat white paper. I called the MFR about this and I was told they are both genuine Scott products. Depending on which factory made them, some will be embossed and others flat. If you are purchasing from Amazon as the SELLER and not a 3rd party, this is GENUINE and not \"fake.\" I am so tired of reviews claiming products are \"fake.\"",
