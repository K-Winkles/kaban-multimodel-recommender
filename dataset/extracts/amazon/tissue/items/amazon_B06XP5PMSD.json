I can live with that if they don't melt on use, but I really hate that these are bleached white and they are overpriced. I will find an unbleached, cheaper alternative that's hopefully softer too.",

The box they are stored in, the box they are shipped in, the tissues themselves are made of bamboo which a renewable resource as it regrows itself and doesn\u2019t have to be planted as a seed every time one is removed. The tissues are thick and absorbent. They are not quite as soft as the softest Kleenex or Puffs that are advertised for raw noses but they\u2019re not rough either. If you truly care about the environment give these a try at least once.",

I don't mind texture so much (and I have allergies), because one tissue goes a long way. This is what I was hoping for when I ordered the bamboo tissue. It does come close - softer, but not as thick as the Italian ones, I went through the box pretty quickly. So given that, it is WAY too expensive!! I also tried cotton tissues, also hypoallergenic and lint-free. The cotton is softer then the bamboo and not quite as costly.",

A face full of perfume and dust is the last thing I need when I\u2019m already sneezing or my eyes are watering.So I went on a quest to find a better tissue, and that quest ended with these. They have almost no lint and absolutely zero fragrance.They also hold up better than normal tissues when damp, so they\u2019re great for blotting excess facial serums and oils if I get a bit overzealous.The only issue I\u2019ve run into is that the company twice sent the wrong shaped box. I didn\u2019t have the heart to send them back (the tissues inside are the same, after all). Haven\u2019t had and problems with that for a while, so hopefully they\u2019ve gotten that problem sorted.",

Plus it helps to save our environment and our precious trees that take years/decades to grow.",

Although it had a smooth texture, it felt hard and scratchy against my nose, and now I've got a little abrasions because of it.If they could make them less rigid, it would be a welcome improvement.Possibly, make them in 2-ply instead of 3-ply would help. Removing that 3rd layer will make them less thick, more flexible, and possibly feel softer on the nose.",
