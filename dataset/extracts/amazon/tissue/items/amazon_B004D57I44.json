                "reviewText": "TL;DR: good form factor for car trips, plenty of tissues to keep you covered, different color at bottom of the stack tells you when to grab a fresh box. Not the softest tissues on Earth, but not the scratchiest, either.--The Long Version--These may not be the softest tissues on Earth, but they're good enough for me, and the box is the perfect depth for the door pockets of my 2004 Subaru Forester and will fit the door pockets on meant other makes and models. If it doesn't fit the door pockets (or your auto doesn't have them), it's also a good fit for a glovebox or many center consoles.Moreover, the shorter box depth largely eliminates that annoying thing where the tissues fail to pop up through the slot once you've used about half of them.Since my nose insists on running like a faucet at inopportune moments, it's good to know that my ever-present box of tissues won't be rattling around the floorboards or hiding under a seat when I need it.The manufacturer incorporates yellow tissues to let you know when you're near the bottom of the box so you can grab a replacement box before you run out. Hotels make use of this feature, but it's also handy for car trips ... it helps prevent running out of tissues halfway through a three-hour drive and having to either hunt down a store or pay through the nose (pun intended) for tissues at a gas station.This package includes enough tissues to keep me going for a year and still give a bunch away. If you have kids or a bigger household, YMMV, of course, but this is still a handy way to lay in a supply of tissues in a box size that can be hard to find in stores.This 30-pack would also be a good fit for AirBnB hosts or anyone who has a lot of guests.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these after I connected that our old office and most hotel rooms stock the same tissues, and then I found them on Amazon. I love being able to buy a case of a bazillion boxes at such a low price per box, so now I have a box of tissue everywhere I need them, and I have more boxes to grab whenever one runs out. I have these on both my desks, on my night stand, in the kitchen, on my workbench, and in the bathroom.These tissues are a little rough on the nose, but they are perfectly good for occasional, and they are strong. (I think my family uses them as napkins when the napkins are out of reach). I rated softness 2 stars because if you are used to name-brand tissues, then these are less than average on softness.",

I have allergies and chronic sinus issues, so I use a lot of tissues. I was very grateful to find these and they are actually cheaper per tissue than what I was paying for a large big box store's value brand (Hint: rhymes with All-Fart). I'd definitely say they are comparable in quality to those, and they haven't given me a sore nose yet or anything, so I'm good. I also tried one other brand of bulk tissues (Hint: Rhymes with Glamazon) and they were prone to having shredded tissues and lots of tissue \"dust\", so I went back to these, which have no such problems.",

                "reviewText": "I've managed an optical business for the last 10+ years. For years, we've been purchasing the 48100 tissues in the yellow box for cleaning lenses and they worked very well, never scratch lenses and dont smudge lenses like the lower quality tissues preference sells that have more recycled paper content.The new blue boxes are a lower quality paper than the yellow boxes and they are also not as soft. How can I tell? When using tissues with high recycled paper content, they will randomly leave greasy streaks across the lenses. It kind of makes you question the recycled paper sources. The older yellow boxes would never leave greasy smudges like the cheaper green boxes did, but now the new blue boxes leave greasy streaks as well and to top it all off, they made the sheets smaller, so you are getting less tissue than before. Will be looking seeking out a different brand in the future.",

For a brief time, she had enough tissues for her class. I may send another case for Christmas!These are a really good size for classrooms. If a box gets dumped (it happens), you are only out a small quantity. There are enough boxes in a carton to give one to every student if you have a fixed group (like kindergarten). Good deal for everyone!",
