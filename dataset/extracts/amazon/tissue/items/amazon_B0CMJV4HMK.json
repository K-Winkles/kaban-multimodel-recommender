The cylindrical containers are pretty sturdy. They're not going to get crushed easily. You could throw the spares in your glove compartment or in the trunk and they're not going to get smashed easily.The design is clever and convenient for putting in cupholders, especially when someone in the car is sick or has allergies.It would be nice if there were refills sold.The tissues are okay. They are not as nice as the tissue that most of us are accustomed to. They are a bit on the thin and small side. They are bamboo, so there is going to be a difference. They're not bad, they're just not quite as good as what most people have been using over the years.A three pack for the current price of about 10 bucks is not too bad, in my opinion.",

The little cardboard containers fit in cupholders and side door cupholders perfectly and feature adorable prints on the outside. While I love the look of the containers, I can't say I love the tissues. The tissues feel like the tissues you get on airplanes - thin, slightly rough, and tears easily - and the sheets are smaller than standard tissue paper. I found that when folding in half and blowing my nose, I still felt like I got snot on my fingers. Overall, these are very cute, but I'd rather have a box of tissues in my car with standard-sized sheets that are thicker.",
