While they may not be the softest, they are definitely durable and absorbent.The tissues are strong and hold up well during use, which is great for anyone who needs a more heavy-duty tissue. They may not be the best option for those with sensitive skin or for use on delicate areas, but for general use they work well.Overall, I would recommend these tissues for anyone looking for a more affordable option. While they may not be the softest tissues on the market, they are certainly a good value for the price and get the job done",
