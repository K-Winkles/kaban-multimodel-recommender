                "reviewText": "Not exactly what I was hoping for or expecting. It IS a toilet paper roll. I will give it that. And it IS black. Two very strong points. But as others have said in their reviews, and it is true, it is much smaller both in quantity of paper as well as size of the sheets when compared to normal toilet paper rolls. It also has the consistency of a cocktail napkin. Makes for a pretty tough sheet, not overly soft at all, and again while it feels like a cocktail napkin it's not the size of a cocktail napkin. It's kind of the size of a puny small cheap off-brand brand of toilet paper. But with really tough sheets of paper. I guess I am just so-so satisfied with the product. Not dissatisfied, but not really overjoyed either. Here's a photo of the black Renova roll next to my normal toilet paper roll. This is the only view you'll ever get from inside of my bathroom.",
