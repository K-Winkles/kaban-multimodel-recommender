                "reviewText": "I recently missed my bi-monthly delivery because of a mix-up on my part. So I went to my local store and purchased a different NAME brand (starts with Sc) bath tissue that was on sale, good price, and I had a coupon on top of it. NAME BRAND AWFUL (starts with Sc). Never, EVER again will I make the same mistake. It's supposed to be soft and strong, but was so thin and harsh it hurt my nose, my lady bits and other parts, and fell apart in normal use.LESSON LEARNED - Quilted Northern tissue is BY FAR SUPERIOR to the other NAME BRAND. It is soft on my lady bits, holds together very well for all other tasks including nose blowing. It might be a tad more expensive, but to me the far SUPERIOR QUALITY, SOFTNESS, and DURABILITY is WELL WORTH IT!! As soon as I figured out my error on my bi-monthly shipment, I immediately placed a replacement order. I am SO GLAD I DID. Never again will I buy any other product. No I am not being paid for this review. It is my honest opinion, as well as the opinion of the other adult in the household. QUILTED NORTHERN IT IS!!!",

                "reviewText": "Quilted Northern Ultra Plush has become my go-to toilet paper, and for good reason! This 3-ply bath tissue boasts impressive softness and absorbency, making it a luxurious experience compared to other brands I've tried.First, let's talk about the positives: the plushness and absorbency are top-notch. It's a real treat for your tush, and the 3 cushiony-soft layers really do pamper you. The 18 Mega Rolls pack is also quite convenient, as each roll is equal to 4 regular rolls. This means less frequent roll changes and fewer trips to the store. So far, so good!However, there is one drawback that might be a deal-breaker for some: the width of the toilet paper. It seems Quilted Northern has decided to cut down the width a bit, and it's noticeable. You might find yourself using more TP than before, which is a bit of a bummer. But, in my opinion, the overall quality and comfort still outweigh this issue.In conclusion, Quilted Northern Ultra Plush toilet paper is a fantastic option for those looking for a softer, more absorbent bath tissue. The width might be a tad disappointing, but the luxury and convenience of this product still make it well worth the investment. And hey, who doesn't want to pamper their behind?",

                "reviewText": "This is my hubby's favorite toilet paper. It is the only one he will use. He says that he likes it because it is \"strong and absorbent\". The truth is, he likes it because it is super soft and gentle on his sensitive tush. During \"toilet paper shortage\", he was distraught because any of the toilet paper available was not working for him. When my brother came to visit from Germany and he used this super soft Quilted Northern toilet paper, he was aghast because it was too soft for his manly man German butt. Luckily we still had some sanding paper from the pandemic (ahem, other brand toilet paper) left over, so my brother could use that which was a win-win for my husband because now the other man in the house wasn't using his beloved softy-soft toilet paper. So if prefer a Swedish massage over a deep tissue massage, this toilet paper is for you!",
