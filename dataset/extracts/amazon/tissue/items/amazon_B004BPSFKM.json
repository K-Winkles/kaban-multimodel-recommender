                "reviewText": "I use a lot of tissues with having chronic sinusitis. These are absolutely the best I have ever used. I've been using these tissues for many years without any problems. These do not rub my nose raw like so many other brands. The tissues are built with a thickness that keeps the discharge from leaking through. The packaging allows for easy access and dispensing of the tissues.",
