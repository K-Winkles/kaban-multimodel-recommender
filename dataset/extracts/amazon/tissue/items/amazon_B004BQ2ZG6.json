These Puffs Simple Softness might not be as thick as the Puffs Ultra Soft, but the size of the box is a deal for me when purchased in the combo pack of 3 boxes. I also keep the cube Puffs Ultra Soft boxes in other rooms such as the bathroom. I have found lower prices on this product at Target in the past, but I also get to use my RedCard discount and there's usually a manufacturer coupon that helps lower the price, but I wanted to try Amazon's subscription services to see if it would help me save money in the long-term and this is one of only a few of my usual items I've found available for Subscription and unfortunately haven't been able to find many other deals on my other regular items yet to get the most out of the service.",
