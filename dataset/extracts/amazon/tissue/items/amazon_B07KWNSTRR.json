                "reviewText": "So I was looking for a sams club/members mark dupe but this one reminds me most of dollar general's brand or angel soft because of the size of the roll. However, its MUCH softer than those.. really a bit softer than sams too! Each sheet feels very plush even for being commercial 2 ply! what! I LOVE IT! Its so much softer than I expected it could ever be and it resembles NOTHING like the tissue we consistently find ourselves using in facilities like store and clinic bathrooms. It owns a superior higher quality to all of those in my honest opinion for only being another \"commercial\" tissue. I was absolutely shocked and extremely pleased right away. I currently have some rolls left of sams members mark MEGA rolls (275 sheets per roll instead of their normal 235, a total of 1467.8 sq ft in a full case). The mega rolls are clearly bigger obviously its a \"mega\" roll (see pictures) but the quality is nearly equal to the new commercial rolls we now use. Also I'll include a picture of 3 sheets from each roll, the amazon sheets are a little shorter in measurement. But I'm a huge fan of these, even though I'm not used to seeing much smaller rolls in our bathroom lol but its wrapped in thin paper which keeps it fresh and from collecting lint or dust. I love that. Great for storage purposes. It also makes it easy to give to my neighbors on my street during these times to help everyone out and also to give to my family and friends in other towns ofcourse! I love the value ratio of cost to roll quality. This just cannot be beat. Seriously. This many amazing rolls for about twice what we usually pay. Im down for that and Im so glad I tried these despite some negative reviews I read!! I will definitely continue to get this brand whenever sams is sold out because they are basically like sisters as far as quality, I'm not disappointed AT ALL! My oldest child thinks it's the softest tissue ever, softer than our sams staple which I do kind of agree with. *Its not too soft that it tears apart during use. In fact it does not tear or leave anything behind at all.. no lint, no debris. Dissolves fast enough in the water that our toilet never choked on it like it usually does with thicker premium ply tissues xD Its got a medium absorbency, a little less than sams but its totally ok! It was so awesome to my entire family that I had to review it. No regrets whatsoever. One of the best gambles I've made shopping here.",

                "reviewText": "When the pandemic hit we were one of the couples who frequented the supermarket to stock up with toilet paper and paper towels, among other things. Some years back, I had bought a box of 96 rolls of highly discounted, single-ply toilet paper from a retail store. It lasted a long time. After reading some of the reviews on Amazon\u2019s Ultra Plus Commercial Toilet Paper I decided to try it, with my wife\u2019s approval. I ordered the 80 roll box on September 19, 2020. We intended to hold onto the Ultra Plus as backup toilet paper and continue buying additional toilet paper as we had been.After having the Amazon toilet paper sitting in the garage for a year, we decided to start using it. I didn\u2019t know what to expect, thinking that it may not be quite as good as I had hoped for\u2026a little too thin, not very strong, etc. I was surprised to find that it was pretty comparable to most of the toilet paper we had been buying on sale.Before writing this review, I researched reviews on the \u201cbest toilet paper\u201d. It seems to me that choosing toilet paper is all about personal preference. Each brand and different types of toilet paper in each brand have its plusses and minuses. The adage that you get what you pay for also applies. The best-performing brands are generally pricier.Amazon\u2019s Ultra Plus Commercial Toilet Paper is certainly competitive with other brands, considering price, strength, and comfort. It seems to fit in between pricier, premium, and basic necessity toilet paper. The convenience of having a box of toilet paper with 80 rolls in it, individually wrapped, is nice. If the price for a box of it is attractive to you, and you want to try something a little different from what you\u2019ve been using, it is something to consider.By the way, my wife still prefers and uses, the basic single-ply major brand toilet paper. I\u2019ll use anything, but this is a good choice, in my opinion. I\u2019ve included some pics of toilet paper that we had already bought on sale to compare with the Ultra Plus.",

It's 2 ply and soft and absorbent enough for us. Quality is a little subpar in that the sheets sometimes peel off as it's unrolled, but not a problem. I will buy again. At 30 cents less per roll, this tp is our go to now.",
