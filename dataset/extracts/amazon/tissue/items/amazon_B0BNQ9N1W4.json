Also the travel size tissues are larger and thicker than the boxes as they are making the tissues smaller and thinner do to the economy being so lousy. If you remove the outer packaging of the travel size and slip it inside this product, they fit perfect and you can remove one at a time smoothly. Ordering 2 more for little stocking gifts!",
