                "reviewText": "I\u2019ve got a ridiculously runny nose and was a bit worried these might be too rough for my everyday needs. They\u2019re not. They\u2019re actually soft.. perhaps not as soft as tree based tissues but I would not hesitate to use these if I had a cold. They\u2019re sturdy, but soft. And a big bonus: no lint! The box is smaller than a typical tissue box. I use tissue box holders, and like other reviewers have noted, the tissues can be difficult to pull from the box. This causes the tissue box to bang against the inside of my metal holder. If it\u2019s up for consideration, I\u2019d suggest to Amazon they make the tissue box a larger standard cube size which might also alleviate the issue with tissues being difficult to remove from the small box. Other than this issue, I think the tissues are great and will purchase them again.",

                "reviewText": "I bought these on Prime Day to try out the bamboo tissue figuring, why not. As expected, they arrived quickly and well packaged to avoid damage. I like the simple packaging design and would describe it as handsome. The smaller footprint of the box is appreciated for a bathroom with limited space. The individual box of tissues was easy to open however getting the first and several subsequent tissues out of the package were difficult and seemed that the package was over-stuffed or possibly designed for the same quantity of tissue of a thinner quality. The actual tissue was initially a surprise. Getting surprised by tissues is not a common occurrence for me. I found the tissue unusually thick and strong and was surprised that the texture was quite soft for such a strong tissue. There is NO need to use double tissues under conditions where a typical tissue may tear with excessive moisture. These are tough and candidly more durable than some paper towels I have used. If you are a \"double up\" kind of tissue user, these are for you; only one needed and they are soft too. I hope Amazon increases the packaging size to allow for easier access to the tissue but even so, these were a good choice for me. I am happy I tried bamboo tissues and will certainly look for them again.",

They look nice sitting wherever I have them. I had used the recycled paper version of these that this brand has and they are similar. However, these are a step up. The tissues themselves are strong. They are not the softest though. With my allergies they are making my nose raw. For allergy season I prefer Cloud Paper tissues for softness. Any other time of the year, I stick with these as they are a more budget friendly option.",

                "reviewText": "I love the bamboo products from Amazon. Recently I have switched over completely and all of my paper products are bamboo. I find it much more durable but not incredibly abrasive to sensitive skin.These tissues saved me recently while I had the local plague that gets passed around this time of year. The tissues are durable and you can use them more than one blow and they don\u2019t fall apart. That is a huge requirement for me because when I get congested, I really really get congested and I need tissues that are not for the weak.I have extremely sensitive skin and these tissues were gentle on my face and did not cause any kind of rash or outbreak (I do not believe they contain any extra ingredients or scent, which I like.) It took over a week of constant blowing multiple times an hour for my nose area to become a bit dry and chapped. A few nights of hydrating balm / ointment had it right back to normal and I continued to use the tissues. No other problems yet.",
