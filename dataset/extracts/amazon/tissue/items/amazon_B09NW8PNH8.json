                "reviewText": "This is some high quality stuff! Extremely soft! The rolls are super fat too! So thick that it might not even fit properly on your wall-mounted toilet paper roll holder it it's a small one. Definitely a lot of paper on each roll. Each roll truly is equal to 2 or more standard rolls offered by competitors. So, don't mistakenly think you've found a better deal just because you found another brand that offers more individual rolls for the same price or for a higher price. Also, keep in mind that some of those other sellers have a product that feels like you're wiping yourself with a brown paper bag! Not this though! It's 2-Ply, soft, and strong. Best deal around! Buy with confidence!",

                "reviewText": "I started using this tissue over charmin once I lived where I have a septic tank. It states that it is recommended for septic tanks so that was a win. It is not as soft as charmin, but it\u2019s soft enough! Nothing like Scott! I highly recommend especially if you have a septic tank!",

As a kid we had 7 kids and never enough toilet paper so I laugh that I have a stick in the garage. My kids wonder why I only let the roll get down to 20 percent and take it off. I chalk it up to childhood trauma, but each time I get a box of TP I am happy. Call me weird, but happy. The product is my favorite brand, it\u2019s soft, it works and it arrives on time each month.",
