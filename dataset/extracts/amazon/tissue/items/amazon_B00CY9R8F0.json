They were here only two days before my nose started running and I got really sick. These tissues are very soft. They almost feel like they have lotion in them but apparently they don't. They're two ply and thick enough not to tear and they don't irritate my skin. When my cold was at its peak a few days ago, I was going through these tissues like crazy. I usually end up with a red, chapped nose from all the friction but so far, so good. My nose has not become irritated from all the nose blowing.These tissues are simple white ones which I prefer and they easily come out of the box one at a time. I have been using them for ages and will continue to. The price is a bit higher here than in the drugstores if I catch a sale but I order them here to be sure I always have a box on hand. I don't need anything more than these for blowing my nose and also for tissuing off cream to remove makeup. These are soft on my skin.",
