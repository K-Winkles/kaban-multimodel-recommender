I will now be buying them to use exclusively because they are so convenient and work really well!I\u2019ve always wondered how sanitary it is to use the same wash cloths over and over- even after washing. Wash cloths can trap mold or keep old makeup stains no matter how many times you wash them. These give you a fresh new towelette every time and my skin seems to have improved since using them.They have a textured side and a flat side and the size is very generous. I was concerned that these might be a paper towel texture or shred after wetting them, but neither is true. They are high quality and feel like a much more hygienic product to be using on my face every day. These are a new staple convenience item for me and they would be amazing for travel. I find the box they come in to be sufficient but I know they sell a sturdy, more aesthetic box to hold your towels. The box it comes in is perfect for me, though!",

                "reviewText": "I have extremely sensitive skin, and when I am not taking care of my skin, it shows. I started using these over a year ago, and about 2 months ago I ran out. I did not order any until last week, and I tell you what - I can absolutely tell the difference between using these and a regular washcloth or towel. Mind you, I try not to scrub my face with either type of towel (I try to only pat dry as needed after washing) but at the end of the day I need to get my face clean whether I wash it properly or not. These are AMAZING. They are great if you only need to pat dry, and they are even better when you need to wet them down and wipe your face clean. They are soft and absorbent, not flimsy at all, and I can even wipe my face, rinse the towel, and wipe my face again without it breaking down. They suggest using them to wipe down your countertops after using before you throw them away, and I very often do this before tossing.I will also say, I am not a huge fan of disposable products - especially when there are easy reusable alternatives, but unfortunately for me this is one time that I allow myself to purchase disposable. The difference they make for me is absolutely worth it. They are also great to travel with - I stashed a few in a ziplock bag and take with me anytime I travel. I whole-heartedly recommend.Note: While I do like the size of the towels, I also sometimes cut them in half to get more uses.",

I first purchased these about a few weeks ago when I decided to start taking care of my face and doing a routine AM & PM. These are hands down my favorite face product! I know how that sounds but that\u2019s how convenient and useful these paper towels are. They\u2019re very comfy, soft, good on the skin. Me and my significant other don\u2019t notice a smell but I have read other reviews that say they dislike the smell.Moving forward these are a necessity and will always be used.",

I used my face towel/hand towel 3-4 days without washing it not thinking twice on germs etc. In 1 week, my skin is clearer, and I have had no breakouts. I did not have acne much but a zit here and there. I love the ease and that I can wipe the sink and counter after, it's very satisfying. I love it so much I got the bamboo container to hold them. I will never use a towel again. LOVE LOVE them. I use my hand mostly to use my cleanser as I have rosacea and I need gentle, but I have been cutting these in half every so often and using one half as my washcloth to get a bit of a more exfoliating action going and no irritation or flushing. The box also looks very pretty on my counter.",

As other reviews mentioned, yes, they have a slight odor to them, it is not unpleasant and I suspect due to the material.",

I also dry and keep the used towels and they are perfect for using in my weekly cleaning of the bathrooms. Yes, they may be a little expensive for what they are but I have had NO more blemishes since using them. I especially like that I dont have to use hotel towels when we are away. I have no idea what products they use in their laundry. Another tip is sometimes I cut the towel in half and it is still more than enough to dry your face.",
