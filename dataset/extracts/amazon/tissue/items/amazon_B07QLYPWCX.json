                "reviewText": "This 365 100% recycled TP is the Goldilocks for me in that regard. It's soft enough to be comfortable but strong/grippy enough to actually get you CLEAN. (I find that overly soft TP does not \"grip\" waste properly when wiping and/or is too lint-y, but I also do want something that is soft on my bum. ) Plus, this product is much less likely to clog my toilet than a lot of other brands I've tried. I will say, though...if you've tried this and feel like it's not soft enough (again, I disagree, but to each their own), DON'T try their \"sustainably soft\" one. It's not good, nor is it sustainable. Instead, I would get the ARIA brand recycled bath tissue. I was shocked at how soft that one was; I'd never have known it was recycled. It was actually too soft for me (and pricier than the 365 one) but I did find it to be strong and get the job done. ARIA would be perfect for someone who wants to help the environment but feels like 7th Generation, Green Forest, and 365 100% Recycled aren't soft enough. You CAN keep us from destroying the boreal forests while still getting a Charmin-y experience! But for me, personally, the 365 Recycled TP is just the right level of comfort and functionality for a reasonable price (especially in the bulk pack).",
