But together our choices add up, \u00adand we can make a difference by using 100% recycled paper* bath tissue. If every household in the U.S. replaced one 24-pack of 240-sheet virgin fiber bathroom tissue with this product, we could help save over 4,900,00 trees**. Pretty remarkable, right? But just because you care about the environment doesn't mean the products you use have to work any less. Seventh Generation 100% Recycled Paper* Bath Tissue is an extra strong and soft 2-ply toilet paper whitened without chlorine bleach. It's gentle on the environment, septic-safe and RV-friendly, too. For more than 25 years, Seventh Generation has been thoughtfully formulating safe and effective plant-based products that work. Really well. Seventh Generation Free & Clear 100% recycled* white toilet paper, unbleached toilet paper and bathroom paper towels are made with no added dyes, inks, or fragrances. Our Free & Clear 2 ply toilet paper is Forest Stewardship Council certified as FSC Recycled* (FSC C115279). We'll always need toilet paper, and we'll always need trees \u2013 we're here to help with both.",

                "reviewText": "This toilet paper does the job very well. It is strong, soft, not lint-y, and each roll lasts a long time. My favorite recycled brand is actually Marcal, which feels like silk sheets, but ultimately went with Seventh Generation because it has a higher post consumer waste minimum (50% min for Seventh Gen and 30% min for Marcal). Some reviews say that this TP is too thin and rough. Sure, it's not as cushy as Charmin, nor does it glide like silk across your butt, but I have never experienced discomfort. It feels cushy enough, does not rip or disintegrate, and gives a clean wipe. It's definitely not like the gas station toilet paper that comes in a big heavy jumbo roll that is too flimsy to even support you pulling off more than a tiny fistful at a time.In terms of waste, I appreciate that these Seventh Generation rolls are strong and soft enough that I don't have to go back for more or even use an excessive amount in the first place. I also like that rolls are 500 sheets because I can't stand the idea of so many cardboard tube cores. The rolls were packaged minimally in one box (no plastic bubbles, no styro popcorn, no cushioning paper), with each roll wrapped individually with paper (which I prefer over plastic packaging).I guess TP preference is a personal thing, but if you're not looking for much, you will be surprised at the punch this TP roll can pack in terms of environmental friendliness, as well as personal comfort.",

                "reviewText": "I love soft toilet paper, like Charmin and Cottonelle, but in a household with 3 girls and only 1 man, we would go through a roll in a day. Also, the other super-soft brands are so dusty, not to mention too thick--resulting in double and triple flushes to make sure a plunge wasn't needed.The trouble with other thinner brands (Quilted Northern), was that they were two-ply (always coming apart--for some reason the two-ply that separates bothers me--especially when only one ply starts rolling and the other stays on) and to flimsy.So, we tried this. Ecofriendly too. We joke that we use \"recycled toilet paper\" and our friends give us a funny look :) But, using recycled paper toilet paper makes us feel good, and the sheets are not too thick but sturdy. If you have tummy troubles and need something extra cushy for your tushy, this may not be for you, but for the normal user, this works. We've used it for years and haven't switched.Another great and amazing feature: 60 in a case. SIXTY! Since there's plenty of paper on the roll, I don't have to change it every week, And, I always have a case or two in the basement to turn to. We use subscribe and save for these, and I don't mind when I forget and get a shipment sooner than necessary because I love not having to buy tp at the store.I started ordering this when my children were younger and hauling them and a cart full of groceries and a case of toilet paper to the car was a chore. The more I can get delivered to my door, the better. Cases of tp right to my house = perfect.So, yes, it's thin, but it's sturdy. A roll lasts us several days for sure, and I don't make my kids measure squares--just pull it out, rip it off, and use what you need. It's not going to clog! It's not expensive! And I won't have to change the roll by the end of the day or go to the store for another case. (oh, and no fuzzy pieces to worry about sticking in unwanted places or making dust all over the place--very minimal dust).One last comment: it starts easy (no peeling and tearing and part rolling off), and it ends clean--no bits left stuck to the roll, so you can use the leftover rolls for kids' crafts without bits or glue left on.",

I went looking for something that fit that bill and was a subscribe and save item as well.I was a little skeptical about using something \"recycled,\" worried that it wouldn't be soft enough. No, it's not the velvety texture but it's plenty soft enough.Absorbent, no ripping, shredding or falling apart.This is a huge pack of TP. I ordered two of them a month ago and we've not even gone through the first pack with three of us in the house (2 women, 1 man/2.5 bathrooms).I'm happy to use this if it means protecting trees.",

                "reviewText": "This product is very expensive compared to others, but after using it for almost five months I have to admit that it is worth the higher price for these reasons:1. It feels soft. I recall when we first started using it that it felt different from other brands, but I can't even remember what the difference was.2. It is strong. Other brands I have used fall apart as you are using them, which makes you use even more. This one has never fallen apart; no bad surprises, even when using just two squares.3. It lasts a lot longer than others. Once you get used to how strong it is, you will find yourself using less. On top of that, each roll has nearly twice the number of sheets as other so-called \"double rolls\". When you put those two together, I figure these rolls last 2-4 times longer than other brands. We have a big family, and my best estimate is that these are lasting about 3x longer per roll than any other brand. If I divide the price by three, then the cost is about the same as other brands.4. It is 100% recycled, which makes your conscience feel good.5. It does not cause any problems in the sewer pipes. Our house is old and has small-ish pipes. We were having troubles with the pipes becoming clogged every couple of months. I wondered if using these would help, and so far we have not had any problems.So overall, yes it is expensive, but I recommend these and will keep using them in our home.",
