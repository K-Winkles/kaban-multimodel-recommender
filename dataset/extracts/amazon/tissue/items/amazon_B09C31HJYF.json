                "reviewText": "Typically I would only buy big brands like Puffs with Lotion for my nose because my skin always gets raw and scabbed when sick. My only issue with those brands is they tend to shed really bad. I wear glasses and they are always covered in little fuzz/lint from the tissue which drives me crazy. These are really nice because they don\u2019t have that same shedding. They are soft and a good thickness. Really great for the price. The box design is subpar but if that\u2019s how they save on costs I\u2019m fine with it. First tissue ripped when taking it out but otherwise no issue with that. I\u2019d recommend to friends and family.",
