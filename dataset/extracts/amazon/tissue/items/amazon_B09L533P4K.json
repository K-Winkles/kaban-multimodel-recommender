                "reviewText": "I used to buy only Charmin because there's a few things I've never been willing to go with another brand no matter how much money I could save and toilet paper was at the top of that list. Little by little I'm breaking that habit and this is one thing I gotta say I wish I'd tried years ago. I actually think this toilet paper is better than Charmin. I'm impressed with how thick, durable, soft and long lasting it is. I hate generic toilet paper that is so thin you need an industrial size roll just to take care of a number 1 let alone find yourself alone in some friends bathroom with wondering how on earth you're going to take care of a number 2 without everyone knowing when you either block the toilet because you used an entire roll or because it took you an hour and a half to unroll all the toilet paper you needed. That may sound ridiculous to some people but if that's the case you're likely the friend with the generic toilet paper that people dread seeing. If so the fact you're even reading this says you question the fact that you get gifts wrapped in tissue paper that's thicker than your toilet paper and the fact that so many of those gifts were small brown cardboard tubes says it all.This stuff is actually the beginning of my personal journey to find an acceptable balance between price and performance so I can't say for sure that this is the cheapest but it is cheaper than what I'd used before. As for its quality, I find it to be excellent. It's thick yet long lasting and strong yet soft which is what I look for in something that takes care of a subject some people are too uncomfortable to discuss.",

It\u2019s not too plush but not too thin. I was able to purchase it at a good price here on Amazon. The only concern I have is that this toilet paper does not break down as well as some of the thin, cheap toilet papers. That means although it leaves your bum happy (assuming a bum can be happy), it can be harder on your plumbing and septic system.",
