However, the packaging process of the tissue leaves a little bit to be desired. Specifically the ability to get the single tissues OUT of the box. I've used 8 of these so far and almost ever single box has at least one point throughout it's usage where it will just stop pulling the next tissue up. There is then no fold or crease to grab onto to get the next one out easily, so you end up having to dig your way into the box and pull up a bunch at once. First world problems, I know. But I've been using tissues for a long time now and I've never seen this issue occur so often as with this batch. Also, I've found several small little bits and pieces of 1/4 tissue strands that look like they were part of a machine malfunction at the factory. So maybe it's just all a QC issue that will be resolved.",
