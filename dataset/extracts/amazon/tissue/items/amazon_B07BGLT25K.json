It's no cottonelle or Charmin but it's the best budget paper I've found. I will say for a $6 pack of tp, charging $3(half the item price) to get it next day when I was getting other items delivered already anyways seems a bit steep but I guess we have to pay for convenience. Used to get nearly everything next day for free but anymore it seems they want to tack on a fee. I order a lot of household staples last min on Amazon and used to appreciate that I could get them next day because on a tight budget you don't tend to order more than you need in advance. I don't mind waiting a week for a tee shirt or book or whatever but waiting a week for tp in a house full of people is not ideal so I just paid the $3.",

                "reviewText": "I am truly a prima donna when it comes to toilet paper. Charmin has been my preferred brand for as long as I can remember. A few times during the pandemic I did have to buy alternates, the ripples kind was awful, the other premium brands were okay, bamboo paper was very soft but not very absorbent. Always fantastic when Charmin was back in stock.That being said, the latest rounds of Charmin Ultra Soft are lower in quality. The paper does not feel as \"ultra\" soft, more like nicely soft, and it shreds so fast. They are making the rolls bigger and bigger, they barely fit in the holder, but having to use twice as much is annoying.Clearly Charmin Ultra Soft is still a superior product to most on the market, just not as prima donna pleasing as it once was. So, a 4 star instead of a 5.",

                "reviewText": "I'd say this Scott Tissue Paper (Comfort Plus) is very reliable in being both soft & comfortable. It's pretty thick and absorbs well which leads to having to use less tissue paper so it lasts awhile. I accidentally got Regular Scott Tissue earlier this month & there was a huge difference. It was only 1 ply where as this is 2 ply so be sure to not make that mistake. I could've got better tissue at the Dollar Store seriously. It almost ruined me from Scott for good bc I was not expecting that from a name brand tissue but then I saw that this one I usually get says comfort plus & it's a fantastic value for the low price. They are definitely keeping up with their competitors. I would recommend this specific type of Scott Tissue paper only. I would never get the regular \" long lasting\" one again!",
