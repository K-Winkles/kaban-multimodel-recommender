I love the convenience of having a box of tissues in my home, office, and car, making it easy for me to have a soothing and refreshing experience whenever I need it.I highly recommend these Kleenex Soothing Lotion Facial Tissues for anyone looking for a gentle and effective solution for dry skin.

I mean, it's not the sexiest topic, but when you've got seasonal allergies or a miserable cold, a good tissue can be a real game-changer. This Kleenex product I've been using lately is a real gem. It's hydrating, it's soft, and it's got vitamins and nutrients up the wazoo. I mean, who knew a tissue could be so fancy? But seriously, if you're sick and you need to blow your nose approximately 45 times an hour (no judgment, we've all been there), do yourself a favor and ditch the sandpaper-grade tissues. Your poor nose will thank you.",
