Whew.So one person in my household has mobility issues.Going to costco or normal groceries is hard bc he doesnt move as fast and we are (I am always) very worried some kids/crazy suburban stay at home/aflluenza teen is going to run him over and be a jerk.So to prevent me from ever assailing people from running into/being jerks to himI decided we should get the subscription.Another selling point:Say you are the only one taking care of someone special needs and you are a costco-er such as ourselves.Costco is convenient.But let's say it's JUST YOU.You have to assist your special needs person up into the vehicle safelyas well as the goodsbc they may not be able to assist you depending on their needs/limitations.Also you have to unload by yourself while making sure you safely assist your special needs person from the vehicle into the house.My dad can't really lift boxes anymoreSo helping with bulk items can't and should NOT and DOES NOT happen.My mom is retired and older as well.Fully able butwith my scheduleI am not always with her to assist on errands.I either do errands for herto/from work or on days off.Instead oflifting an awkward bulk order of tissues off a shelf, onto/into a cart, off the cart, into the car, then out of the car, into the house, then putting them up/storing themORRMaking SO MANY runs to the store throughout the year for one or two boxes of facial tissue at a timeYou can subscribeand drag in an awkward parcelonce every 6 monthsStore it all and diminish supplies as you goFrom the comfort of your own home.(Ps I do the heavy lifting in the house)Our overall subscription order wasn't very heavyEspecially since the tissue boxes took up most of the room.It comes in it's own cardboard boxOnce you take it out to store, visually you think, 'HOOOLY... D:'We ordered in dec or janAnd we all have year round seasonal allergies.Plus we keep a box on the dinner tableA box in our carsOne by our bedsWe use a lot.I blow my nose a lot.I wipe my eyes a lot.",

This makes for either wasting some tissues or creating a stack of unused tissues on counter - not good.Also, there is no color change at end of box to indicate you are down to last 10 and will need new box.",
