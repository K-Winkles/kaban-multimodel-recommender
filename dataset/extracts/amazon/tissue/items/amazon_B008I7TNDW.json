                "reviewText": "We are a household of two adults. During the pandemic, when people were stocking up on toilet paper and other products, I came across this deal. I figured it was easier and more cost effective, as prices rose and supply fell, to purchase in this capacity. I have found that for the two of us, we only have to reorder every 6-7 months. There are no more short runs to the store or forgetting to purchase toilet paper during our grocery shopping trips. We just stock our 2.5 bathrooms up and we are 'good to go.' Pun intended. This is a great deal though. Take a look at the shelves in the grocery stores and compare the prices. Here we have 80 rolls at .74 per roll/$59.87 per box (no tax here in PA on toilet paper). Scotts is good for our septic system and is not a thick or dusty brand toilet paper. It is the usual thin that any Scotts 1000 sheet 1-ply roll would be, but these rolls have 473 sheets on a 2-ply roll. Good enough to get the job done and they are all wrapped separately, so they aren't getting dusty or dirty sitting on the shelf or sitting under the sink.",
