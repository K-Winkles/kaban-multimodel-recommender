                "reviewText": "Used Kleenex brand for dinner time before I tried these. Kleenex has 96 tissues per box compared to 58 in the puffs box, but the Kleenex are thin, single ply, requiring more of them to get the job done, and frequently get stuck in the box so you have to dig in with your fingers to get the next tissue out and in the process, tear and waste a bunch of them, which can be very frustrating when you urgently need a tissue in the middle of the night. These Puffs have none of those issues, so a box of 58 actually lasts longer than the Kleenex box of 96, and they provide more comfort while requiring much less of your time to fuss with them. So, bottom line: Puffs are superior and give you more bang for your buck.",
