                "reviewText": "These are just the softest and smoothest most comfortable tissues on the planet! The coconut oil is very soothing when using this tissue on your face. The scent is very mild. I can use these all day when I have allergies and the tissues will not irritate your skin. I look forward to using these tissues all of the time. I have a box in every single room. I stock up because I never want to run out of these for my family. We all love them. The boxes also have cute little designs on them to perk up your room. I also give these tissues to my neighbors as well. This 8 box set is a super great deal for the price. Much cheaper than the local stores!",
