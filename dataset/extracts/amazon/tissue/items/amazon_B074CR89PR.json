I bought this based on the positive review and because I am always looking for a good deal with the best quality. So I gave my friend a pack as a gag gift. He opened his first so I asked how he liked it. He told me he loved it. Because 1. The tab that starts the role actually works. You are not digging threw multiple sheets trying to get the role started. 2. It passed the finger test. When you use it, your fingers don't poke through. 3. Comfortable with just enough cushion. I just opened my toilet paper today and it was everything I dreamed it would be. Haha. Seriously, I definitely agree with all the reasons my friend gave. This is great toilet paper and well worth the money. Side note neither one of us have a septic tank but it's septic safe.",
