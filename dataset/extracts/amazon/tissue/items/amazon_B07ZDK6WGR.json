It holds up very well during use. It doesn't really seem to break down as quickly as I would like in the toilet but none of the brands I have preferred do. Even with that, I have had no issues with clogging the pipes. My only issue is the very small rolls that are wrapped as loosely as regular store tissue. All other bamboo tissue I have tried is very tightly wrapped, making for much more tissue per roll, and they are larger rolls than these, as well. It still lasts longer than a regular store roll because you use less, but it does make them more expensive to use, even though the cost for 12 rolls is lower initially. I honestly am not sure how great the difference in cost per use would be. Going on the merits of the tissue alone, and nothing else, it really is great!",

                "reviewTitle": "3.0 out of 5 stars Unbleached clogged my 70 year old 3 inch drain pipes, but is the best I've tried!",
                "reviewText": "I actually love this UNBLEACHED Silk'N Soft TP, but... it clogged my drains and I had to have my landlord call in the professionals. 3 bottles of max strength drain cleaner/clog remover, a 6 foot snake, and a new wide plunger didn't do anything... I seem to be the only one who purchased the unbleached brown variety, so here's my review of it! For all the deets, read on! For the TL;DR peeps, scroll to the bottom of my review.I am trying to live a greener, cleaner lifestyle. I also have super sensitive skin, and wanted a better option for my bottom. I had used Charmin Ultra (Soft and Strong) over the years, and recently began to acquire a rash! While researching this phenomenon, I came across an article (which I fact checked to be true) about the impact that popular toilet paper brands have on the ancient Canadian forests, and I knew I had to change. I've been avoiding buying things in plastic as well, so the search was on for plastic free, tree free, bleach, dye and perfume free toilet paper.I bought Silk'N Soft because it is the highest rated tree free bamboo option available for softness and thickness. It is both soft AND thick, and a nice shade of natural brown, but it didn't break down in my 1950s little house. I am in the city, have good plumbing, but the pipes are only 3 inches. More modern homes have 4 - 6 inch pipes. A couple days after starting to use this TP, sewage started backing up from our basement floor drain. It was mortifying, considering I live with other people who discovered the mess! The only thing new or different that could have caused this clog was the bamboo TP. I also sampled 2 other brands of bamboo TP, and 1 brand of green tea TP. I decided to do the \"jar test\" and filled each jar 3/4 full of cool tap water, a square of each type of TP, and shook them up a bit. All fell apart instantly except Silk'N Soft Unbleached. That does say something for its strength, though! For the short time I was able to use it, it didn't pill or roll at all! I did a second test & let sit for 36 hours before shaking, with 3 squares of SnS, and the only signs of any breakdown were at the perforated seams. They didn't come completely apart, though! So that settled it. I'm currently looking into options as far as a return/refund.Had this TP broken down, it would have been the winner and favorite of all the types I tried. Despite the rougher looking texture, it was quite soft! It's very absorbent, resulting in having to use a fraction of the amount of \"regular\" TP. It used be made with sugarcane fiber and bamboo, but they removed the sugarcane before I could try it. I think that would have made it softer and maybe easier to break down? I'm not 100% on that, as both sugarcane & bamboo TP (this and Seedling) I wanted to try had the sugarcane removed from the formula. It came packaged in a cardboard box, which was better than plastic (IMO), but it was loaded with plastic packing tape! *cringe* The core is bigger than my other TPs, and it is bright white in contrast to the brown natural paper. I do not know what it is made of, but it appears to be cardboard.Pros:Tree free bamboo - YAY!UnbleachedDye FreeUnscentedFragrance FreeThickAbsorbentNice texture (could be a little less 'rugged' though)Cardboard/paper packagingCons:Doesn't break down quicklyPotential to clog pipesLots of plastic tape on outer packageLarge coreExpensive compared to other bamboo brandsThat's it! Of everything I tried, unless something changes in the future, I will be going with my second choice of bamboo paper that does break down, which is Who Gives a Crap. I also tried Seedling by Grove Co., Who Gives a Crap recycled, and MonkeyLips Green Tea, which turned out to have virgin tree pulp in it, so I can't currently recommend as an eco friendly option, but they are working on reformulating with bamboo instead of trees. Yay for progress! It is a lovely paper, especially for sensitive ladies.",
