These are full sized tissue paper that are folded down very well to a small size. They pack well and are easy to use. Big enough to be torn in half and still get the job done. Not too hard on the nose but not too soft as to be annoying to use. They hold hand sanitizer gel well for cleaning use on the phone. And they hold a flame pretty decently as emergency fire tinder. For a price a very good value. Would recommend.",

During COVID-19 this is a great way to provide a little extra protection in my office. The pack is very small, but people normally only need a few.
