Sometimes you pull a two ply tissue as advertised, sometimes it's a three ply tissue which means that the next one will be a one ply tissue and nobody wants that. Often the tissues will not \"flag\" from the box as expected, forcing you to ding into the box to dig into the box to get the next one out. Based on years of my own purchases experience, I am definitely losing money on these compared to other products like the \"Kleenex\u00ae Professional Facial Tissue for Business (21400)\" simply because the Amazon tissues are often wasted. A three ply tissue is one ply too many and a one ply is useless so it goes in the trash unfulfilled.",

Well, everything that could go wrong with a box of facial tissues will go wrong with these facial tissues, every time.1-Pull up on a tissue and 3 come out.2-Pull up on a tissue and only 1 ply of the next one comes out.3-Pull up on a tissue and none pop out. You have to fish around inside the box to find the next one.4-The box itself comes apart--you can tell they used as little glue as possible to still be able to call it \"glued.\" Amazon might as well bundle these with a roll of tape. If the box happens to fall onto the floor, the tissues will fall out of the box.5-They're quite rough. For me, I consider that a plus--ultra soft tissues tend to feel like they're just spreading your snot around without actually scraping it off like these do. But I know for many people softness is important.These are cheap, but I can't consider these a good value for the price.",
