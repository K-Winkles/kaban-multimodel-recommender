I already have a sore nose after just using two boxes. The actual boxes do NOT look like the ones in website photo which shows gleaming, gold bricks in an artistic arrangement. In reality they are just various browns, mauve, dull yellow and white which do not shine like in the photo. The boxes are also somewhat crumpled. But even if the boxes were the beautiful gleaming gold like the photo it would not matter. The tissues are the lowest quality and the worst I've ever used. I regret buying these tissues.

Will buy again, but will say shipping the products and the condition that they come in man does USPS or UPS or whoever is used to deliver really does a number. Majority of boxes dented. However, for our use, that's really not to much of a concern. Just letting others know of shipping results. Then again, I guess that's to be expected now days.",
