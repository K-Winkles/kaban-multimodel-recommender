I bought this before running out of my other brand to test it out and decide if it would be my new replacement or not. It is a little more linty upon pulling out of the package but it is soft and thick enough and I think it will be our preferred brand for some time.",

We really love this brand and hope it nevers leaves Amazon as we would be lost.1",
