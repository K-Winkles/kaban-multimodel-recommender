THE BOXES WERE INTACT AND STILL STRONG!!!!! They were NOT collapsed and ripped and bandaged together with wads of tape. THANK YOU TO WHOMEVER FINALLY DID THE RIGHT THING IN THE SHIPPING DEPT!!! Toilet paper is great. We live in rural area. Fancy, plush toilet paper clogs the sewer so the quick dissolving, inexpensive good quality 2ply that's not plush and linty, is perfect for us and this paper is perfect for us! It holds up! It doesnt dissolve in the middle of the use, it is 2 ply, each individually wrapped ...good and sanitary!...great price! Walmart brand toilet paper cannot even beat the price! I get excited to order toilet paper! Good deal, good paper, arrives in less than a week!",

The quality of the paper is decent for commercial applications, but you may want to go with something better for the home. The rolls are somewhat small. They probably do contain 500 sheets as advertised, but the sheets are just under 3\" in length and just under 4\" in width, which is tiny compared to Scott or Georgia Pacific toilet paper. So they are cutting corners to make their product look extremely cheap, when in reality, it is just somewhat cheap. The best way to compare toilet paper is to look at how much each pound of toilet paper costs. This product in its box weighs 26 lbs according to UPS, and so... Each pound of this toilet paper costs $1.47 ($36 / 26 lbs - 1.5 lbs box)",

                "reviewText": "At first glance, this is what it appears - 96 rolls of two-ply toilet paper. This toilet paper isn't the awful public restroom stuff, it's actually pretty nice quality. Unfortunately, the rolls are fairly small. Don't buy this thinking you'll get 96 regular-sized rolls, but even with the small size this is still a great deal. I didn't feel ripped off, because for $30 + shipping this is not bad at all.Lastly, I was VERY impressed by the seller, ReStockIt. Despite it being \"ground shipping\" and a delivery estimate of a week or longer, I received my order the very next business day! Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to order this toilet paper again.",

                "reviewText": "I'm not sure if I am in the minority, but I really like this toilet paper. It reminds me of Scott which is a lot more expensive, except this paper is actually 2ply where scott is only 1 ply. If you want gimmicky \"soft\" paper, this isn't it, this stuff is not very soft. But... it's toilet paper and it gets the job done, in my opinion better than the soft papers. I find that other papers are thicker and wider, but that doesn't mean I use less. If anything, I end up using more toilet paper with software or wider papers, because most of the width gets wasted. This paper is plenty wide, and less wasteful because less of it gets \"left blank\" if you know what I mean. Anyway, I will continue to buy this paper as long as it is around. The price is great, and the quality is just fine.",

                "reviewText": "With a family of 5, I was getting really sick of constantly running out of toilet paper. I purchased a bulk pack from Walmart for $15 and it was such a nice feeling to not have to think about replacing it for a month. This toilet paper (at 96 rolls) should mean I don't have to worry about something as trivial as toilet paper for a lot longer than a month!Item arrived packed with individual rolls and not using a bunch of unnecessary plastic, which I appreciated. The quality of the paper is similar to that you would find at your local supermarket in the cheap range but the rolls are much thicker.If you're looking for soft, fancy or extra thick paper - this is not for you. However, if you're like me and don't really care about name brand quality but are sick and tired of buying toilet paper every week, you'll be really happy with this purchase.Edit: This one order lasts my family of 5 about 6 months. I actually get sad when we finally run out; it's amazing how much a simple act like NOT having to buy toilet paper every week helps your sanity!",

                "reviewText": "Couldn't get a better deal than what I got on Amazon Prime day which was an additional 40% off which made 96 rolls of toilet paper $18. I told everyone about this deal because you'll never find a deal like this again and even at $32 for 96 rolls it still beats anything I could get in the stores with coupons. The quality isn't crazy thick or anything but it is two ply with the quilting similar to Angel Soft and it doesn't tear when you wipe so there's nothing left behind to gross you out, that's all that should really matter.",
