                "reviewText": "I recently got the Ocmoiy 50 Pack Wedding Tissues Packs for Guests and was impressed with the quality of the product. The individual tissue packs are the perfect size for guests to take and use. The 3-ply tissues are soft and gentle on the skin, and the \"happy tears\" design adds a special touch to any wedding or event.The only downside is that the packaging is a bit plain and could benefit from a more decorative design. However, this is a minor issue and does not detract from the overall quality of the product.Overall, I highly recommend the Ocmoiy 50 Pack Wedding Tissues Packs for Guests as a thoughtful and practical wedding favor. It's a great way to show your guests that you care about their comfort and well-being. I would give this product a 4-star rating.",
