                "reviewText": "This is the second carton of six boxes that was defective. The plastic piece at the top that dispenses the tissues one at the time was not attached on three sides making the dispenser useless. I had to open the box, take out the tissues, tape the three unattached sides, and tape up the side I opened. EACH AND EVERY BOX!I have always used Kleenex for 70 years. I may have to switch brands.",
