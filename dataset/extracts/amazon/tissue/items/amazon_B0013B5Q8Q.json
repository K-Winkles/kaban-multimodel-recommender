In Germany, \"Tempo\" became the category name for paper tissues, just as \"Kleenex\" in the US. However, Tempos are way superior to Kleenexes. Soft but sturdy. Absorbent, but not falling apart and leaving a mess. They won't even fall apart when one lands in the laundry by accident. They come in small convenient packets of 10, not in unwieldy boxes. Tempos are worth it. Glad Amazon has them.",

I used to bring them over from Germany years ago starting in the 90s because they are so much better than what we have in the US. The package of 30 pocket tissues that I bought here on Amazon are like the larger pocket size I used to buy over in Germany. The minis are a newer compact version, the ones I bought in the past have 7 tissues. For a short time Procter & Gamble marketed them the smaller minis in the US and I was able to buy them here in the US for very short time. The larger car version was more popular here. But for some reason they decided not to continue selling any of them here in the US. Luckily we have Amazon and other venues to buy them. The larger pocket tissues I just purchaced are just ever so slightly thinner but still very good, comparing to the minis sold in the US See attached pictures. They the larger pocket tissues I just purchased are about the same size tissue as the old US minis made in Germany. I do not have the new Japan made mini to compare. They cost more then I would pay in Europe but way cheaper then flying there! I am very happy with my purchase.",
