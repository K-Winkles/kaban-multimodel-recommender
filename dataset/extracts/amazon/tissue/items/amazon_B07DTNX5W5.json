                "reviewText": "The past few months, many major brands and even 2 store brands of facial tissues have been smelling of gear grease (which in layman's terms is - like dog poop) or like laundry perfume sent like Tide (of which I am allergic to.) I am not sure how many factories are involved - but for me that was 2 major brands / 2 big store brands - that are permanently on my naughty list. I have year round allergies/nose issues/asthma - so no odors is critical path. I am happy to say that I've opened 4 boxes to set out in the house already / tested / sniffed - lol / thank the heavens above - Scotties is truly sent free! \\o\\ \\o/ /o/ Now - these are the \"reach-in\" style boxes with the big cut scoop out of the front. I put only 4 stars because the 2 ply is normal softness level. But they have a 3 ply Plus tissue - that they were out of stock when I bought this case. They seem to only be online in the small cube boxes / lower tissue count - but if your nose is sore / tender issues, that's the one I plan to get a case and have for any bad winter colds that might happen. In the past, Scotties plush was worth it for those times. I hope this helps anyone else that has been searching the last couple of months for just a normal tissue that does NOT stink of off odors.",

                "reviewText": "We use quite a few tissues in this house. I was always running out to purchase them at the Dollar Tree. As you may know, that could be hit or miss. Most of the time it was a miss. When I found these Scotties on Amazon, realized they were a much larger box and at a decent price, it was a no-brainer. I'm so pleased that I put these on auto-ship and I can control my order if necessary. I'm very pleased with this product as well as the delivery.5/31/22 -- UpdateReceived another shipment of tissues today. I am so disappointed in the packaging. 6 out of the 12 boxes were so badly crushed on the sides that the tissues rip upon removal. I have tried \"fixing\" the ends of the boxes in hopes it will help. What I don't understand, these boxes were packaged inside a sealed box that was put in yet another box along with the rest of my order. Therefore, these individual boxes of tissues were packed already damaged in the original shipping box. If I receive my next order in the same manner, I will cancel further shipments. I have taken off 2 stars from my original review.",
