HOWEVER I ordered it again and this batch is just ok as it is more of a THIN WAXPAPER with a shine - it is white, and decent enough but is NOT true tissue paper and does not look like it with the sheen or shine on it, disappointed as my first order was what I expected, tissue paper, this is not tissue paper this time, it is a very thin wax paper",

Durable for my needs, a few sheets usually do the trick.",
