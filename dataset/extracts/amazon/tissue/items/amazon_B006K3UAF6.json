                "reviewText": "I discovered this product on amazon and immediately subscribed - I will have these wonderful tissues showing up at my front door monthly.What do you get? Three (3) boxes of 120 3-ply tissues. These aren't just any 3-ply tissues, however, they are the SOFTEST tisues ever! Now if you're anything like me, you equate softness with weakness, but that is not the case here. Not only are these tissues wonderfully soft, they are strong too. I am an allergy sufferer and I blow my nose at least 20 times a day (sadly I am not exaggerating). Some of my nose blows can have some force behind them (I have been known to rip through generic tissues). I have NEVER had a blow out with these Kleenex tissues. The snot stays right where it should - in the Kleenex (hooray for not spreading germs).I would recommend this product for everyone, but ESPECIALLY if you have allergies or a cold. Other tissues cause your nose to get red, chapped and peely (using tissue constantly leeches the moisture out of your skin) but these tissues prevent that from happening. As an allergy sufferer, I will use nothing else. I keep a box of these in the bedroom, in the kitchen, and in my car. HIGHLY recommend this product - I have tried a LOT of facial tissues in my day and this is the BEST by far.",
