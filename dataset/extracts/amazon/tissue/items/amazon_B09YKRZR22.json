The tissues are very soft and they are the ideal for those who have very dry skin around the nose area. They seem very thin but in reality they are very resistant. The way they are disposed in the box makes getting a single tissue very easy, I hate when I need to get one tissue and I get three of them from the box opening. In general a very good product that I would buy again.",

                "reviewText": "Puffs Ultra Soft Non-Lotion Facial Tissue indeed lives up to its promise of providing a plush, comforting experience. Let\u2019s dive into the details:Pros:Ultra Softness: They're not called \"Ultra Soft\" for nothing. Every tissue feels gentle against the skin, making those sneezy days or makeup touch-ups a breeze.Durable: Despite their softness, these tissues hold up well. Whether it's for wiping, blotting, or the occasional tear, they don\u2019t easily fall apart or leave residues.Non-Lotion Formula: For those who aren\u2019t fans of lotion-infused tissues, these are a dream. They provide the comfort without the often unwanted slickness of lotion.Cons:Cost Consideration: Quality often comes at a price. While Puffs Ultra Soft offers a premium experience, there are certainly more wallet-friendly alternatives available. If you're not particularly fussed about the level of softness or are looking for just basic utility, you might find other brands that offer satisfactory performance for a lower cost.To wrap up, Puffs Ultra Soft Non-Lotion Facial Tissue stands out in the realm of facial tissues for its undeniable quality and comfort. It's ideal for those who seek a touch of luxury in their daily essentials. However, for folks who view tissues as a simple, one-use commodity and aren't as concerned about the plush feel, more economical choices are out there.",

                "reviewText": "I always buy Puffs Plus Lotion and have done so for years. They are soft and double ply and cold and flu season. Sure, occasionally you get some mis-folded tissues, or a single ply gets mixed in, but for the most part, they are of very good quality. So can you imagine my surprise when one of the 8 boxes was completely empty. It was a sealed box, never opened, and when I pulled it out of the shipping box, it was as light as a feather. I couldn\u2019t believe it! Eventually I decided to open the box, and discovered I was wrong, it wasn\u2019t empty. It had one lonely tissue laying in the bottom of the box. I would still rate these tissues a 5 star, but in this case I deducted a star for getting 7 boxes + 1 tissue when I paid for 8 boxes. If it ever happens again however, I\u2019ll definitely complain to the company. Was it just an innocent mistake on the manufacturing line, or a clever way to put a few extra bucks onto the bottom line?",

Three of the puffs boxes were in good shape but five are completely squashed and open.I called Amazon yesterday and a replacement was sent out and received in perfect shape today. I have to send the damaged tissues back to Amazon but so pleased to get a replacement so quickly! Thanks you Amazon and happy to be a Prime member!",
