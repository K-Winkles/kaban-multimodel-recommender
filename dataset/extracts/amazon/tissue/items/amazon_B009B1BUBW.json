                "reviewText": "If these were normal times, I'd probably give this product about 4 stars, maybe even 3.5. But these aren't normal times. I've spent hours on Amazon, Instacart, the Wal-store website, etc. trying to find toilet paper, because I'm high-risk and am having everything delivered. I had reached the point where I was starting to stress about whether I'd be able to replace what I had before running out.Of the two brands of \"normal\" TP I've been able to buy during the quarantine but before the shortage got really bad, one of them is far inferior to this brand in every conceivable way - strength, texture, usefulness. The other is roughly equivalent to this one, probably slightly better, but one roll of this brand has almost as much TP as the entire package of 12 rolls of the other brand. And this one is a WAY better price for the quantity.And the best part is that not only will I not run out of TP this year, but I won't have to keep thinking about it and spending time trying to find some.In the world we're living in today, all of that is worth five of my stars.",

This last package I received, 2 of the rolls were damaged (pictures attached). The rolls are still useable, therefore I decided to keep it. It looked like the cutting machine got stuck or was not sharp enough when it cut, and they cut it again with another cutter. Besides that, it's still good. The toilet paper does its job. It's not Charming but it's good quality. It's soft enough where it does not hurt your bottom when you clean. I recommend it for a business.",

That's all I'm gonna say.Ok, in the interest of a legitimate quality review, it is not so thin as some describe and I even prefer it to the ultra thick cashmere-soft products. It is fine quality big-roll toilet paper that you might find at train stations, airports, etc. It will not rip unreasonably, and yes it does last a long time. I plan on using this after I am done with all twelve rolls, which will take me a long time, and yes I mean after the pandemic, too.It also sits nicely on my toilet paper holder (a stand-alone one) because though it is large, the core circumference is still small enough. And no I\u2019m not getting paid to review this or anything, obviously.The hand in the roll is to show help give you an idea for the size. Twelve of these babies. Yes that is a lot.",
