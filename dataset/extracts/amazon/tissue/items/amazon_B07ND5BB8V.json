Absolutely!Mystical Absorbency: It\u2019s like each square is a mini, highly-trained, absorbency ninja. Spills and splashes fear it, and rightly so. It\u2019s as if it whispers, \u201cBring it on, life, I\u2019ve got this!\u201dRoll Endurance: These rolls last longer than my motivation to work out. It's like they have a secret life supply hidden within each layer. Marathon rolls for a sprint price!Aesthetic Majesty: Let\u2019s not forget, it\u2019s pretty enough to be a part of your bathroom decor. If bathroom tissue can be considered art, Cottonelle is the Picasso of the loo.In conclusion, if you wish to treat your derriere to a regal experience, look no further than Cottonelle.

I've been using Cottonelle Ultra Clean in all iterations of its name for a very, very long time. We've tried all the toilet papers, using cheap when that's all we could afford and then using Cottonelle when that's what we knew we were worth.Forget Angel Soft and Charmin; they don't do their duty unless you wad it up a hundred million times. Is Scott TP even mentionable? I hate even bringing it into a discussion where Cottonelle is its \"opponent.\" That's like saying Cottonelle is eating a King's feast on the throne (heh), and Scott is dumbly licking the floor. Please. Quilted Northern is pretty good, if it's all you can find instead of Cottonelle. I wouldn't be heartbroken to have to buy it if the store was out of my favorite and I had to get QN, but I swear those \"cleaning ripples\" on Cottonelle really do make all the difference in the world as far as functionality, and the quilting, as my experience has shown me, in QN is a detriment to its function.Bottom line: we're team Cottonelle All. The. Way. ... And your toilet paper should be hanging under.",
