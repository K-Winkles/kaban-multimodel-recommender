They produce 0 irritating fine particles when used unlike say toilet paper or cheaper tissues. They are also insanely resistant to tearing, to the point that even trying to tear them on purpose is super tough. They are definitely cotton, the fibers are very strong and do not break easily. They are not as soft as say the premium Kleenex brand ones, but those are a composite of paper and cotton and chemicals so not exactly the same thing. I like them. I am kind of worried about the fact that they are a no name Chinese company but I've never noticed off smells or stains or anything else so they appear to have good QC. Overall for the money I think they're great.",
