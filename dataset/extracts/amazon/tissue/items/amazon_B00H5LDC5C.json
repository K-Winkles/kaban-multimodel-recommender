                "reviewText": "Great for our cottage septic tank. It\u2019s the smallest legally allowed in our area (750 gallons) so having single ply paper that breaks down immediately should make a difference in performance and perhaps longer periods between pump outs. It is a bit of getting used to as it\u2019s not as soft as top of the line two ply tissue, but it\u2019s designed for a specific purpose. If you have a septic system this product is for you.",
