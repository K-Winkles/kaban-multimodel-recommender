Two caveats: Just a little bit over a year ago the price was $36. After all the complaints and suggestions over the years, they still have the audacity to ship these boxes without any protection to the product inside. The tissue box should be shipped inside of another box. It\u2019s absurd. This is something we use on our bodies! With my last order, the box was sitting outside on the ground. Cool no problem, because the delivery person is going to put it where they can. However, because it wasn\u2019t taped properly, the tissue rolls were exposed go the elements. Not only that, a lot of the rolls on top had the paper wrapping loose. Gross. Do better, especially since you\u2019re charging way more now!",
