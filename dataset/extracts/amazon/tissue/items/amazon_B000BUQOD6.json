                "reviewText": "I purchased two 4 Roll packages of this product at a cost of over $ 33.00. My order arrived quickly. I operate an environmental friendly toilet at my cottage to meet with the requirements of the law. The waste from the toilet enters a small masher to break up the toilet waste and then pump it into a septic tank where it will compost. I have bought 1 ply toilet paper locally that is just too thick causing the masher to jam which is a nasty job to clean out to enable it to run again. To solve this problem I spent the above amount of money to get marine 1 ply toilet paper. The rolls are very very small and of course thin. I have not used the product yet but I am sure it will complete the desired task. My complaint is, the minimum product you receive for the very high price. We are a captive market needing toilet paper such at this so the manufacturer over charges you for this thinner than normal toilet paper. My daughter picked up in the US a large package of 1 ply toilet paper (non marine) for a very low price. We just eventually ran out and ordered this over priced product. If possible, go to Walmart in the USA and purchase a large supply of 1 ply toilet paper to avoid the need for this Specialty Rip Off Toilet Paper\u2026..",
