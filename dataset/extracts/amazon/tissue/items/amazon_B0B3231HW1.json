The tissues are smaller than you would find an a square of rectangular box and if you like tissues with lotion, they are not as soft, but they work fine for the occasional use. I think that unless you have a cold, tissues in the square or rectangular boxes are too big any way. This is the 2nd pack I have bought and I'm very happy with them. This particular brand was a better deal for the money that others that were available. I will buy them again.",
