I notice that the were made in Italy perhaps the conversion from Decimal system to the Metric system is part of the issue but whatever they were not very good. I've ordered the 3 ply before never an issue but this last batch is bad there should be a internationalquality control especially because the pricing for these items is much higher then they were purchase in the USA",
