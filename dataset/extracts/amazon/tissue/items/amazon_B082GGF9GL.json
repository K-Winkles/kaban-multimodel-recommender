I was sick of going to the store and either they were completely out or they only had generic tissues that were harsh on my nose. These tissues came exactly as listed - 2 packs of 8 (for a total of 16 packs) with 9 tissues in each pack. To me, these are worth the money. The Kleenex are soft and the packs are very handy.
