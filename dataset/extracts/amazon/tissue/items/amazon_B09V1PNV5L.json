The roll is soft and thick, moreso than cheap stuff. I'm over 50 so I'm picky and unapologetically so and yes I actually tell people that life's too short for 1-ply TP. Nope, gotta have 2 minimum. Yet this has 3?! Wow. \ud83d\udc4f It's very soft, SO soft yet strong enough to get the \ud83d\udca9 job done. I'll definitely reorder.",

It does make a pleasant smell in the small bathroom, but I went to blow my nose and it lingered for a few hours. Not sure how I feel about using the TP knowing there\u2019s a sent left where it went\u2026I still love the brand and will continue to buy it. The packaging was nice and held together perfectly during transport.",
