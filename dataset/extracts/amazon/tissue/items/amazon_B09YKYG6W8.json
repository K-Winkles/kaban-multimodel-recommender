What does one look for in a TP? Softness? Strength? The ability to transform your bathroom time into an otherworldly, cloud-like experience? Charmin boasts it all, and we\u2019re about to wipe the floor with this review!\ud83e\uddfb 24 Family Mega Rolls = 123 Regular Rolls \ud83e\uddfb\u201cMath wizards at Charmin, we salute you! How you squished 123 regular rolls into 24 mega rolls, we'll never fathom.\u201d Are they compressed with some secret bathroom sorcery? Did they hire an Origami master? Whatever the method, they seem to think it\u2019s a formula for a never-ending wipe. So for those who dread the inevitable roll replacement \u2013 rejoice!\ud83d\udcaa Ultra Strong, Like a Mini Bathroom Bodyguard \ud83d\udcaaNobody likes a breach, especially not whilst in the throes of personal endeavours.

Respect!\ud83d\udc51 A Touch of Luxury for Your Royal Derriere \ud83d\udc51Designed to be gentle on the skin yet tough on, ahem, residue, this toilet paper could very well be the unsung hero in your daily routine. It promises a \u2018Clean Touch\u2019 which is undoubtedly a nod to nobility for your nether regions.

Charmin, oh Charmin, we adore the plushness, but our earthy hearts bleed for the trees that were sacrificed for our comfort.

It seeks to turn your bathroom escapades into luxurious soliloquies where your behind takes center stage, basking in a spotlight of softness and strength.However, amidst the chuckles and cheeky puns, let\u2019s not forget our green buddies, the trees, who once stood tall and proud. Perhaps the next standing ovation will be for a TP that marries comfort and sustainability? \ud83c\udf32\ud83d\udebd\ud83c\udf1fTake a bow, Charmin, but the encore may just belong to the eco-warriors!",

It made for a crappy situation, LOL.I decided I wanted high quality toilet paper and decided to go with this brand. I have never been let down and all crappy situations have stopped entirely with this toilet paper. It's thick and sturdy, never unexpectedly rips so I'm very, very happy with my purchase. I highly recommend this toilet paper in every way. Everyone in the house agrees this is the only toilet paper to have in the house. Also I have two females that live with me and still they say it's great.",

I've tried almost every brand of TP trying to find the best but cheapest brand.If you hate TP dingle berries then this Charmin Ultra Strong is for you. Everybody knows what TP dingle berries are, it's the left over tissue on your public or butt hair. Charmin Ultra Strong never ever has this problem. Also it is so strong that you instantly use less squares. It's also pretty soft compared to other \"Strong\" brands. A runner up to this Charmin would be the generic Target \"ultra strong\" brand, however it is not nearly as soft and feels almost rough. The squares might be smaller than Charmin too as the rolls are no longer wide but skinny. But it does cost half of what Charmin costs so you get what you pay for.",
