The rolls are definitely large rolls, but I was puzzled as to how Kleenex manages to get so many sheets on a roll -- indeed 451 sheets per roll. Now no one is going to count every sheet. But I wondered if the sheets were smaller than the sheets on my previous toilet paper. In fact, the sheets were exactly the same size! However, the way Kleenex gets 451 sheets on a roll is that the sheets, although 2-ply, are thinner than my other toilet paper. That's how they squeeze so many sheets on a roll. The toilet paper is very soft, but I do find myself using more of it because it is somewhat thinner than what I am accustomed to. Am I sorry I tried it? Not at all. I like the softness, and I did not have to carry so many rolls home. JG.",
