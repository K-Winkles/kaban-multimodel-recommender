                "reviewText": "I have been buying bamboo TP for several years now, generally 48 in a box at a time. This one comes in 4 to a pack, & the price very slightly more expensive. Since my big box was delayed I ordered this to try it. Very pleasantly surprised - Very soft & still strong ! IMO better than my other ones. However - the price is a consideration. If this manufacturer supplies bigger quantities at a little better price I would switch ! But the convenience of getting these 4 packs the next day is also a consideration. I SEE THEY NOW DO LARGE PACKS OF SAME ROLLLS - MY ONLY ISSUE IS - ARE THESE REALLY THE SAME ROLLS OR WILL I FIND TOO LATE THAT THEY ARE SMALLER OR EVEN NOT THE SAME QUALITY ? WE GET CHEATED BY SO MANY SLICK ARTISTS IN MANUFACTURING THAT IT MAKES IT HARD TO TRUST ANY MANUFACTURER THESE DAYS ! I AM CONSIDERING WHETHER TO RISK MY MONEY ON A 48 ROLL BOX !!!",

                "reviewText": "I have been using bamboo TP now for about 10 years and I am convinced that there are many different manufacturers of the TP who sell to different companies. I think this because I find differences in texture within each package. In this last package, there was one beautifully textured roll and the rest were too smooth and slippery. It is annoying to not be able to get the same degree of softness with each roll. Truthfully, I would prefer a little texture like the one roll I found in the package. Totally smooth tends to slip between my finger and fall on the floor. At least this is not course like the last brand I tried. I am ready for a consistently good texture....instead of having different textures.",

                "reviewText": "I've had great luck with this! As some others have mentioned, the actual rolls are kind of small - but in my experience, this doesn't really matter. I feel like because of the thickness and absorbency, you need to use less of this bamboo toilet paper than regular toilet paper. I also have to pick up dog poop with toilet paper sometimes, and the bamboo paper has been way better than the regular paper has been. I've tried a couple of brands of bamboo TP so far and I like this one the most. The other ones I tried were much thinner but this feels sturdier than normal paper. For reference, if it helps, I tended to get the 2 or 3 ply Quilted Northern or Charmin in regular TP. I find this to be superior to that. And so far, anyone who's visited my place hasn't had any problems with the switch to bamboo. I also like that the inner roll is much sturdier than the lightweight cardboard rolls inside regular TP, and that there's no glue involved. It makes it better for recycling, but also I feel like I may be able to get some sort of use out of the rolls if needed so I can minimize waste. Overall, I'm very happy with this. The first time I got 1 pack of 9 rolls but I loved it so much I got a bulk order the next time.",

The rolls are pretty small, like half the size one would expect, but I think that\u2019s because they were not fluffy like most toilet paper. I use tp to remove excess debris before washing my business, so I don\u2019t rely on it to do all the cleaning, I think if that\u2019s your goal, then this stuff is great. That and it being better for the environment than your armin chay and your ott scay brands are selling points for me.",
