It is strong (unless you try to use it to wipe up a little water on the bathroom counter), & it doesn't produce & leave behind \"dust.\" It may not be as soft to the touch as the dust-producing papers, but if you don't rub the hell out of your bottom (haha), you won't have a problem.The thing I find funny about how many plys toilet paper has is that all the manufacturer has to do is make the paper thicker. In the case of this product, when the circumstance needs it, you can fold it over as much as you might need to & the roll still lasts longer.Scott is a great value for the money & I shall continue to use it as long as it remains so.",

I live in an almost 100 year old house and don't want to have to deal with issues like that. It's not soft at all but I like that. I feel like the soft toilet paper leaves fuzz and tends to rip. I'm not sure what the obsession with soft toilet paper is because that doesn't matter one bit to me. I've tried some generic types of paper similar to this but it is too thin. This is thin, too, but a better quality than toilet paper.",

                "reviewText": "It's 1 ply so it's not that cushy tissue soft paper. That said, it performs it's function, is septic friendly, and does not leave behind fibers. It's not a good substitute for tissue if you have a cold. I'd recommend a lotion containing tissue for that. It's really helpful if you have kids that tend to wad the paper up and clog things up. Since it's really a personal preference, I guess I would recommend purchasing a pack and trying it out to see if it works out for your family.",

I do keep Amazon brand 2 Ply for the men in the house and it gives my guests a choice. All men care about is softness because they\u2019re just wiping their butt. Women like to be paper/pill free all day at least I do. Take a mirror and look at all the paper left behind on overly soft toilet paper its gross. This is highly recommended for keeping clean ladies",
