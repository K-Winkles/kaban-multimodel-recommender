These tissues feel as soft and thick as the name brands but with a much lower price tag. They are also less expensive than the value tissues I was getting at the supermarket and are of much better quality. I am very happy and will continue to purchase these tissues. Plus, it's so convenient to have bulky items like these delivered right to my door, rather than dragging them home.",
