                "reviewText": "In these desperate times of pandemic-caused empty store shelves, I've been forced to start ordering many of my paper products online. I reluctantly selected this item, because at the time it was one of the few cases of facial tissues Amazon had available that had a reasonably acceptable delivery date. I suspected they probably weren't going to be quite as good as the store brand I normally buy at one of the nation's major grocery chains. Turns out, I was right. Aside from the annoyance that there are only 100 tissues per box (the ones I normally buy contain 210), I also, after trying them, noticed that they are not as soft as the ones I usually get. Not that they're sandpaperesque, don't get me wrong. But I'd hate to see how sore my nose would get if I were to use these all day with a cold and a runny nose. Thirdly, they are too small. Standard tissues are 12 x 22.5cm. These are just 10.5 x 21cm. While not a huge difference in size, it still takes some getting used to. I'd have preferred if they'd made them standard size and charged a bit more. Ultimately, I don't hate them enough to throw them out. My family and I will use up the ones we have. But when/if it comes time to order more tissues online, I intend to go with another brand.",
