                "reviewText": "Biggest plus is that it's the Kleenex brand at a reasonable per-unit price. In the past, when I have tried to save money, the generic versions ripped my nose apart. The price increase to Kleenex from generic is well worth the in-tact skin around my nose.Second is that this quantity is just the right size. I can easily store it in my limited living space, and it lasts the whole of cold/flu/allergy season. Granted, I am shopping for one, but this one-and-done deal can't be beat.The only negative I have is that it took forever for it to arrive. We're talking the span of over a month. And the box was very beat-up. Not sure if it's because of the shipper making a mistake, or Kleenex dropping the ball somehow. If it wasn't for this, it would have been five stars.Nevertheless, it's a solid brand, a solid quantity, and fantastic price.",
