I'd say this is a cross between a napkin and a tissue.The tissues are doubled layers so it can act like a napkin to wipe stains, but it is also decently soft enough to wipe my nose just not excessively otherwise it might irritate my nose.As for the packaging, the design is simple and cute. Each tissue packet has 10, 8x8 inch sheets. There is a tape seal on each packet. The packets comes in a set of 10 and there is a total of 3 sets which comes out to be a total of 300 tissues.Overall, decent, convenient, portable tissue packets.",

But, the tissue is not soft at all. It is actually of the toughest one I have used. It almost feels like a napkin texture. I do like how thick it is and clean very well too. But I also wouldn\u2019t want to use this for a cold because my nose would be so sore after a couple of uses. The quantity is good though and I know I won\u2019t need to buy more tissues for a long time!",

In fact the thickness is nice, they're almost like a napkin which gives them more uses when you're out and about.",

Works for either, but for me - I\u2019m happy to have them for every day use, in fact I prefer these over my usual name brand travel sized tissues.",
