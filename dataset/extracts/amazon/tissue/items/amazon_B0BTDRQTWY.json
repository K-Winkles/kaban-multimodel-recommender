That stuck with me, so now I get the good stuff, and this is the good stuff. Soft, sturdy, lasts because a little goes a long way, and doesn\u2019t clog the toilet.",

                "reviewText": "I started purchasing this product during the TP shortages because it is a brand I remembered from my youth. I used to use store brands, but as the shelves emptied, I turned to online sources. Amazon has delivered. This TP is soft, absorbent, and well packaged. I really like that it is wrapped in paper and not plastic. I know plastic can help prevent unintended moisture damage, but the paper does a good job containing and protecting the rolls. The large rolls last quite awhile for the three of us and we now have a stockpile for any future shortages that may occur. It is also nice this company works with their supplier and the Arbor Day Foundation to plant trees. I can feel better using this product and knowing my money isn't just flushed away, but helps to conserve a valuable resource, as well.",
