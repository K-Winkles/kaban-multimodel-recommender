These are super soft, small enough to fit into a purse or especially in the backpack, I try to carry one in the glove compartment for that kid who always says \"I forgot to bring the tissues\"",

Otherwise it is kleenex and it is just what I wanted and expected. Products good. Price was ok and will buy more in future if it's allowed. Actually limits of just one seems tacky it's not like your a business to resell if you buy three of these sets of 8 pocket sized ten tissue packs. 24 would not make a business by any stretch of the imagination. Anyway product is fine. Whats written on them is harmless and I don't stop to read them anyway and also sometimes slip into homemade sewin little cases to keep them neater and cleaner during travel in pockets and pocket bags or purses.",

                "reviewText": "Yay! What a happy Little Nose \ud83d\udc43 I am right now (although, the face I\u2019m attached to keeps saying I\u2019m big. We do fight about that quite often )! I sure was suffering there for a few days! But then, these really cute little tissue packs came, and saved me from having this human dispose of this disgusting liquid like mixture, out of my lovely self! Thank you, cute tissues! Each little tissue pack talks to me, because they know how terribly horrid this human\u2019s snots (or, at least that\u2019s one word the human\u2019s call it, you don\u2019t want to know what I think it\u2019s called!) can be, so they try to cheer me up and say things like: Find your Fearless, Seize this Moment (why not sneeze?), Believe if yourself (why not Besneeze in yourself), Summon your Strength, etc...They\u2019re were a pack of 8, and they were all friendly, and they were all very soft! Great size for my my nose, whatever size it may be. My human also said that she would order them again; and, my buddies Mr. and Mrs. Thumbs said they give their thumbs up too (although not literally).I also shopped price and found this to be the best; and having the cute sayings was a nice bonus, and product arrived on time. I hope this helped someone in making a decision. If so, please let me know as I try to track my comments. Thanks, and have a blessed day!\ud83d\udc9c",
