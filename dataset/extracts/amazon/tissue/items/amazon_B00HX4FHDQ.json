They are similar to the basic Scotties brand. Nearly same size save for about 1/2\" difference on one side. The other is a teeny bit softer, but I couldn't tell the difference except when feeling them at the same time. If I have a cold, then I will buy another brand with lotion, and/or buy the longer boxes of tissue.. but for day to day for a multitude of purposes for nearly 40% less price than the cheapest of the cheap at the local dollar general.. I will continue to use these.They come out from the box with no issue. One at a time like any other. Boxes look fine, smell fine, function fine. Product is fine. I just need one to blow my nose. I like it enough that I have it on subscribe/save.No problems. Will come back to update if I experience anything else.",

                "reviewText": "These tissues seemed like a good deal. After all, how different can facial tissues be? Well... let me tell you.1. The tissues themselves are smaller than normal tissues. They're adequately soft, but they're thin and small.2. They come from China. There is no indication of any recycled content, no responsible forestry logo. So one must assume that these are not environmentally responsible.3. They don't come out of the box! In many of the boxes, the tissues were not placed properly, so you can't pull out just one tissue -- you get a fistful of torn scraps or a wad of tissues all at once.These are just awful. Spend a little more and purchase a better product.",

The tissue was thin and scratchy, and I was unable to extract a single tissue without pulling out about half of the contents. Because it was so thin, it all bunched together. I tried a couple more boxes - all were the same. We donated the whole case to the food bank and felt guilty about foisting it off on them. I would give it no stars, but it did arrive in good order.",
