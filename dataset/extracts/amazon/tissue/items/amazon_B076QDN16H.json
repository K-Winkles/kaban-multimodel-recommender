Well, here's a reality check: Virtually ALL \"Professional\" bulk TP, regardless of name brand, are essentially the same; and for a very specific reason. These similarities include: 2ply very thin, non-plush, non-premium paper. Individual tissue-wrapped rolls of approx 450-500 sheets. WHY??? Perhaps you have noticed that the general public tends to treat restrooms that aren't their own like.... well, like CRAP. If these rolls were the plush, thick, luxurious smooch-yer-butt heavenliness some have apparently grown accustomed to, businesses would literally be forced to hire an on-scene, in-house clogged toilet overflow plumber along with a sanitation floor cleaning service. These (professional) rolls rarely clog as it takes about 6 times the square footage of TP to accomplish it. There are some exceptions, of course.... such as Professional Premium Grades aimed at upper-end hotels, etc. So, actually KNOW what you are buying! Words like \"professional\" are printed on there for a reason, not simply to be blissfully ignored!",

I won't be buying it again. My butt, and the butts belonging to those who stay at my short-term rental, deserve better.",

I was surprised at first how thin it is and as others have noted it's definitely not your typical Charmin product, but it's so strong and durable while introducing a softness I haven't encountered in other plastic-free toilet papers. I will definitely be ordering this as long as it's available.Only downside was the box it shipped in was comically large, but well-worth it to me to get a superior, plastic-free product like this. Happy wiping! :)",
