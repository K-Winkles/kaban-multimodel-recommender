                "reviewText": "Due to long standing sinus issues, I have historically gone through a lot of Kleenex. However, I recently found out that some bamboo alternatives were available (which also does my part to save a tree or two), so I decided to order a case of these tissues and see what I thought of them. Overall, I find these tissues to be nicer and cheaper than genuine Kleenex are.One thing I noticed is that these tissues stack many more tissues for the space than genuine Kleenex does. So at first glance, you would think you were getting much less product than you get with Kleenex. However, since each package of tissues has over 400 sheets in it (much more than in a Kleenex box), at a cost per sheet these are actually cheaper. Also, presumably due to their bamboo construction, I find these tissues to be soft on the nose and more absorbent than Kleenex are. As a result, I seem to go through fewer of these tissues than I do with genuine Kleenex.Now the one thing genuine Kleenex has, that these tissues lack, is a decent dispensing box. Yes, the plastic wrapper (that these tissues are shipped in) has a pull out tab you can use to turn it into a dispensing box of sorts, but that arrangement looks flimsy at best. My solution to that problem is to just buy refillable tissue boxes for every place I want these tissues around the house. Yes, that is a one time expense for each tissue box I buy, but I can then refill those boxes (with these tissues) as often as I need to.",

                "reviewText": "I got this a couple of times now. It has become my \"go to\" facial tissue. Like cotton tissues, it is lint-free, but not as costly. Cotton and bamboo are equally absorbent - both not quite as good as regular facial tissue, but good enough. The biggest drawback for me, is it is also not as soft, but it is still okay. I also order some cotton tissues for bad allergy days. Each pack says it contains 402 pieces, but I am pretty sure that is not accurate. I have not actually counted the sheets, but one pack lasts about as long as the large size box of Kleenex, so still is an acceptable substitute considering it is lint-free and more sustainable!",

                "reviewText": "I was trepidatious at first. Usually bamboo-based paper products are from boutique startups and are crazy expensive. Not here - great value, huge amount of tissues per pack, and each tissue is just as good as anything from the usual brands. The only thing that takes some getting used to is the package. They're not in a normal box but rather a pack more similar to a large pocket pack. Once you get used that you'll be happy. Even that makes sense; it's a lot less waste. Try these out! They're my new tissue of choice.",

                "reviewText": "These are our new favorite tissues. No more gooey hands after blowing your nose. They actually hold it without becoming a soggy mess. A little smaller than a regular tissue but doesn't make a difference. We've just opened the end of a regular tissue box once it was emptied and placed a pack of these inside and taped the end back up. These are close to the strength of a napkin but are still soft enough to use as a tissue. They are not quite as soft as a regular tissue, but that should only matter if you get a cold and are constantly blowing - might irritate your skin a little quicker than a regular tissue. Buy these!",

The packaging works extremely well. Much better than the standard tissue boxes. HOWEVER, see the cons.Cons: Too much plastic in the packaging. Wish there was a way they could package in paper instead of plastic. Also, they put two tissue packages in a plastic bag. Not necessary IMHO. Neither of these will stop me from buying this product again!",

                "reviewText": "I really like the idea of bamboo paper products, cutting down less trees living greener... As facial tissues go these are quite good. The issue I run into is that I cannot find a bamboo product that does not come from China or a nearby eastern country. Makes since given that where the majority of bamboo grows. However, that means all of these products have to be shipped a very, very, long way. As stated, I like the idea, but I won't be buying this product again. May have to see if I can find a hemp version.",
