(excellent advice and very appreciated). They are easy to put together and sturdy and who can't use more storage. As I have 4-5 sewing and crafts in my craft room. storage is a BIG must. As I put in the headline, the screws I received were different then the directions, but worked out perfect. Very easy to assemble and will be added storage that is very needed. I am an avid Amazon customer as stores are stocking less and less with Covid issues and have had great service with product, returns and shipping. I would definitely recommend this product for craft rooms or other rooms where buying an expensive piece of furniture would be a poor use of dollars.",

                "reviewText": "This storage shelf arrived today and the box it came it was very well protected from impact damage during shipping. Assembly took less than 10 minutes and was very intuitive, though instructions are included as well. The holes drilled into the material are the perfect size for the screws provided. You will only need a philips \"+\" screwdriver to tighten the screws in place. An extra screw and screw cap are provided in case you misplace one during assembly. No felt pads or rubber bumpers are included for the base, but I had some so I applied them to the base to eliminate contact will the floor. The material is smooth unlikely to chip unless you scrape it with something heavy and metallic. I even bumped the screwdriver head into the sides a couple of times and there was no damage to the surface. The size is perfect for use as a bookshelf as you can see in the images, and I expect this shelf to last as long as I treat it well. Highly recommended.",

And a bonus, the boxes I got fit in it perfectly as well! (From separate buyer). They give you nice stickers to cover the screws. Maybe that wouldn\u2019t look nice in the room alone but under my desk you don\u2019t notice it! You can always solve that with paint I am sure, or putty. Anyways, very easy to assemble I did it all by myself and am very happy with my purchase.",

If you want sturdy furniture for your living space, room or garage then this is not for you. This is at best a furniture item to keep in a corner to keep stowaways and where there is no need to move this piece.What you may like: Inexpensive, shows as in pictures. Finish is OK as well.What you may not like: Although assembly is easy, it is also easy to make unrecoverable mistakes. Take it slow, follow instructions, do not over tighten the screws and use your head mostly. This is not sturdy furniture. It is meant to be kept in a corner, put items in/on it and not move it a lot.",
