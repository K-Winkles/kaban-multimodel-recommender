                "reviewText": "I purchased this bookcase despite the reviews for the affordability and ease of assembly. It was a bit time consuming to put together but once I got it set up it wasn't too bad. If you are thinking about purchasing this I would say to be sure to have a mallet on hand to hammer in the poles to the plastic attachments because this is what will help to ensure it is more secure. The set doesn't come preequiped with tools so be sure to have at least a mallet handy. Also be careful with the paper film because it can tear easily since it is quite cheap. I also had some clear construction adhesive gorilla glue as there were a couple of the films that had rips in them I took the glue and layered a thin layer across the bottom where the tear was and let it dry. Additionally, if you intend to place large books in this case I would suggest lying them flat so that there isn't too much weight being applied to the film (remember this is Literally a Cheap case) so don't expect too much for the price. Overall it took me two hours to put it together and I took my time. These are photos of it the next day prior to me adding the books in it and to be honest it is sturdy but AGAIN I used a mallet during the installation process. This review is lengthy but I hope it is beneficial to helping someone during making their purchase. Happy Shopping. \ud83d\ude0aUpdate: I uploaded a couple of photos of the books being added to the book case just for a better visual.",

I know people aren\u2019t happy with the clarity of the instructions but honestly, it would be hard to mess this up. It took me 35 minutes and the hardest part was slipping the shelving sleeves on the poles. But a mallet does come in handy for making sure everything is tight and secure.3 pleasantly surprised with how sturdy it felt once together. Is holding my kids gaming units just fine.4. Overall for the price, good shelf. Would buy again.",

It is not hard to put together, but I would suggest GLUE during the construction of this \"book case\". It sure helps out, believe me.
