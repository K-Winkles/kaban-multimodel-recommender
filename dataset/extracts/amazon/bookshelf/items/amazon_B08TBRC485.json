                "reviewText": "I ordered two of these to act as nightstands and I\u2019m very pleased with them. There was an issue with one of them. The holes on one of the pieces were placed on the wrong side so I was unable to put it together. It was easy to put together and equally easy to take apart and with free returns and Amazon\u2019s exchange options, it wasn\u2019t hard to send it back and the new one was delivered the next day. It was a slight inconvenience but these things happen. I let the company know what happened and they were extremely kind about it. Customer service goes a long way so it was appreciated. The replacement was fine and I really like them. Like I said, they were very easy to put together. A lot of the reviews seem to show that the drawers don\u2019t fit but I didn\u2019t have that problem. It\u2019s the perfect blend of storage space and shelves to display decor. These were really a great buy, especially for the price.",

                "reviewText": "This product came with a mold cloud. mold smell got everywhere I laid this box it came in. I had to wash everything including the screws . the drawers aren't usable because of the smell and they don't fit anyways. I want to send it back but i had to throw the box it came in to my garbage container it was horrible moldy. After i cleaned the mold with ammonia off of it I had to wash the rugs it sat on and actually had to take it out side to washing and assemble it. Then I found the mold attached itself to my electric heating unit that I had in the kitchen so I had to wipe that down with ammonia. This was the worst ever. I will never accept a box again that smells this bad. where on earth was this stored. I almost thought it was some kind of chemical weapon the way the mold attached itself to everything. Never again will I buy from this company being unsure where the items are stored is a major factor. Out side of that issue its small which i knew and very nice easy to assemble but the drawers dont really fit and is hard to pull out so since i cant use them anyways because of the mold and they are cloth I will cut wood and stain it for two more shelves. bad experience. not worth 95$ maybe 60$ if it worked and didnt stink",
