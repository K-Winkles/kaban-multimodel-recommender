                "reviewText": "I was hesitant to order this because of a lack of reviews. When it arrived in a small box I discovered that each leg or pole was only about a foot long so I was worried about the stability of a tall narrow shelf with so many pieces. It did take awhile to assemble. Maybe 90 mins but not due to difficultly but just the number of parts. I was, however, taking my time so I could have done it faster if need be. In the end the shelf was just what I needed and was very stable. I think it looks very modern and for the price you can't beat it. Of course it's not real wood but would you expect that for the price you pay. I'd re-buy this in a minute if I needed another.",

This was HARD! Took me almost 2 hours and I am literally icing my hand right now- I had to wear a pot holder when I was trying to tighten the screws it was really difficult to do without.Now that it\u2019s done- I love it. Thank goodness.But I almost gave up and returned so unless you have a really strong back and strong hands- this might not be for you.",
