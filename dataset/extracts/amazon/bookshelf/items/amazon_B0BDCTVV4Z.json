The post go into the shelves further then they should, no safe to stop them and hold them in place. Would not recommend spend a few more dollars and get something else.

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Absolutely PERFECT for my specific needs!",
                "reviewText": "Ok, let me get the negative out of the way. Here we go. These are absolutely not made for anything super heavy, I do not believe. For example, a lot of books. Especially heavy books so if you store books, I suggest keeping them light weight. Also becareful when sticking a book on the shelf because books have sharp corners and will most likely gouge the \"paper cloth\" material that makes up the gray exterior. Also if you have books that lean over, I feel like that could cause issues with balance so storing them straight in there or flat without having them lean to oneside is probably a good idea. Aside from books, I think this would work well with video games or to store light weight clothing like socks or washcloths and towels or fabric and yarn if you are into sewing. Anything light weight should be fine. Plus anything too heavy and you won't be able to move the shelf without it potential coming apart.As far as assembly goes, they require good hand strength and elbow grease because it is important you get the included metal piping firmly and solidly inserted into the brackets. These come with wooden mallets which I think are useless. I really do believe you need to have enough hand/arm strength and dexterity to solidly assemble these. Then you have to twist and eye all to make sure everything is straight and even or you will have a crooked shelf that wobbles. Also the metal piping is very soft. This is the reason for the 1 star deduction. Because I was changing up the build design a little, a few times I got in a groove and forgot to wrap the gray exterior around the piping before I added another piece so I found myself having to take a shelf part off and when I did that, I could see deformities in the tips of the metal pipes from the effort it took to take them apart. These are not easy to take a part once assembled and you have to be careful if you do because the metal is thin, soft, and can become damaged during assembly or disassembly if you need to take it apart.The reason I got these is because I have a collection of Kpop Monsta X Twotuckgom long body pillows and I needed display stands for them. I had been having trouble with finding shelves big enough and deep enough to properly display these without costing and arm, leg and a kidney. Honestly, I haven't needed to buy shelves or book cases in many years so imagine my shock when I saw today's prices. Anything in my budget was just way way too small. Sigh....then I saw these and the price was reasonable and they were big enough. I ended up ordering 6 knowing that what I was storing is light weight tall and balanced. Funny enough, I only ordered these to display the body pillows and I was still searching for another set of shelves or racks to display the other plushies in the collection. Well it turned out that these were tall enough for the body pillows and because I didn't use the materials to make the shelves as they are intended, I actually had enough materials to add a storage cubby at the top to store my short body pillows and then I was able to display the costume pillow collection on top so I was able to store 3 times what I had intended when I ordered these!Ultimately, for me personally, these look like 5 star organizers but are 4 star due to the not so great quality materials used. I mean, look at them, they are perfect for what I needed them for and at less than 20 a piece, I could afford to buy 6 of them and store 3 times what I intended and they look great to me. On the other hand if you need to store a lot of heavy books or any heavy items that lean, I would suggest going with something more solidly constructed because these aren't cut out for that.",

This is the farthest thing from being a bookcase, shelving unit! Amazon should be ashamed and embarrassed to even advertise this item. The products on Amazon used to be good, high quality items, now the items they sell are laughable! Really going downhill Amazon! I've learned my lesson, this will be the last time I order anything that is supposed to be furniture...Return on the way!",
