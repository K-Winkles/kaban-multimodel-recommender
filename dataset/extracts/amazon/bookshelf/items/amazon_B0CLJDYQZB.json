Binders and books once scattered across my desk now have a place. This was a really good find.It was tedious to assemble compared to other similar sized items, but otherwise , I would definitely order another for the opposite side of my desk.",

Although the instructions were backwards and not useful, the actual bookshelf is nice and exactly what I needed.This shelf is quite sturdy and will hold a lot of weight. It is made of good quality pine wood with a matte polyurethane finish. Even though they have included screwdrivers, you will need an electric one. This unit is solid and using a manual screwdriver will not work well.The unit is versatile and can be used throughout the house. I can definitely see it used as a nightstand or even to hold toy baskets in a playroom. I love that I have the option to purchase more shelves and stack them on top of this one. It will definitely help with creating storage solutions.Overall, I am happy with this purchase, even though the instruction manual was not helpful (this is why I gave it a 4 star rating).",

                "reviewText": "This hands down was one of the easiest shelves to put together. That being said, there were no directions provided, and I actually did not install the shelf correctly to the wall initially and had to flip the bottom shelf in order to get the shelf to be flush with the wall. Directions would have helped to prevent this mistake from happening.The shelf is simple and cute. It is made of real wood so you will be able to see some of the nicks in the wood and in some spaces, you may be able to see the grain of the wood. This doesn't bother me personally and adds to the authenticity of the piece, but if you are going for a more rigid look, you may need to add some wood filler and another layer of paint or forgo this piece.The screws are very obvious in this piece as you can see. I wish that the company had opted for either matte black or white screws. They aren't super noticeable per say because they are only visible at the top and bottom of the shelf, and I have the shelf hung pretty high and over a desk, but I do feel it detracts from the look of the piece. I am unsure why advertised pictures of these shelves show the screws on the side of the shelf.I was able to get the shelf hung in one try by myself, and thank God for that because the wall anchors are huge. Even when drilling with my largest drill bit, the anchors were a bit of a challenge to get into the wall. The screws were also a little challenging to get into the anchors. I wish they had included a tool for this. I was able to use my drill. The measurement for this was very precise. I was off by about a 16th inch. I was able to use a mallet to slightly bend the screw enough to get it into the shelf. (Also prior to hanging the shelf, I had to file down the inside of the holes for the wall anchors as one was very narrow. I highly recommend checking this before hanging). The shelf only hangs by the top shelf. I would for my own piece of mind have preferred if there was some support in the bottom shelf too, but this would have made hanging harder.",

I like to do a lot of DIY, and this can be customized to fit your decor even more; it takes paint, wallpaper, and Epoxy Resin very well. Nice size, can be used to display anything from art to beauty products depending on your space. Easy to put together, very good instructions. It does have weight, so make sure you install properly!!

                "reviewText": "This shelf turned out to be larger than I expected based on the pictures. Items to note are:1) The white finish on the shelves is not completely opaque. You can see the wood grain through the white finish.2) The shelves do not look like the shelves pictured in the first two pictures in the Amazon ad. They look like the third picture with the screw heads on the top and bottom. You can clearly see these after the shelf is assembled.3) Assembly instructions are not provided. While it isn't difficult, you do need to get the shelves properly oriented. The curved edge on the bottom shelf is on the top side but the curved edge on the upper shelf is on the bottom side. Another way to look at it is that the countersunk holes for the screws are on the bottom of the bottom shelf and on the top of the upper shelf. The Amazon listing has a short assembly video.4) A small bubble level is provided (see the video) but I'm not sure how much help it is. The two wall anchors need to be positioned appropriately spaced and level before you can mount the shelf. You can try to hold the shelf on the wall with the level resting on top so you can draw a line along the top shelf but you are going to need two people to do it. A laser level might work better.5) This is a heavy duty shelf that feels very solid once assembled. As it is held up with only two (large) screws and wall anchors, I'm not sure I would load it up to the 100 pound limit stated in the Amazon ad. But, it should hold a lot.",
