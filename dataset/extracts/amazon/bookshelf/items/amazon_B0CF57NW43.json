                "reviewText": "This book-keep came quickly and securely. It was easy to put together. I love the somewhat generic design. It wasn't generic to me. It is just right. I purchased this one because I read both types of books, hard-copy and ebooks with audiobooks. My Signature fits perfectly in the trough made for that purpose. The circle cutout for a cup is big enough for any but a very large water bottle or thermos.I haven't been using it all that long but my feeling is that it will continue to prove itself as a valued book-friend for yourself or for anyone you purchase it for as a gift.",
