It went together very easily but make sure you pay attention to the pictures on the assembly pamphlet. I put the 1st shelf on upside down because I didn't pay attention! I probably assembled it in 20 minutes with the included Allen wrench. The glass shelves are perfect for decor or as I'm going to do, plants. Once assembled, it's very sturdy, and has feet to level it. It matches my new golden light fixture perfectly.",

                "reviewText": "Hello all, this is my 2nd black shelving unit! Love the colour, I tried the gold once but it wasn't for me. Black is grounding and goes with everything. Love the size of it, it is for behind the TV in a corner to lift all the wiring up off the floor. I have the 4 shelf unit back in there now but it is too tall so with this 2nd unit, I deleted one tier. I had to undo the unit twice before figuring out how to delete one shelf. Seriously, don't tighten it all until you know everything is where it should be. Please pay very close attention to step one when starting out. The placement of the corner pieces is key, and they fit either the longer side or the shorter sides, opposite corners. so that the holes are facing outwards. I didn't catch this immediately so had to undo it nd change the pieces. Vasagle's directions are good, pretty clear to follow, and you get extra pieces which is wonderful. The package comes well boxed and the company offers support should it be required. Can't beat the pricing! I actually wish I had more room in my unit because I like these shelves! Happy New Year!!",
