I did find it annoying that I had to undo one shelf because it was slightly pushed forward compared to the others, but it was an easy fix and my fault. My only other complaint is that the back wall of the shelf is a tad small and it is hard to center it perfectly and make sure the nails have enough to \"grab\" when they're hammered in. It's pretty sturdy, but I do feel like it won't last that long - I hope I'm wrong because it does look really nice.",

The packing for the unit made me have to vacuum immediately due to the styrofoam being the cheapest of cheap a company could buy to pack their goods in. Due to cheap packing it came in with damaged corners and a cracked shelf which I chose to use at the bottom of the shelf so you couldn't see it (I'm only using the shelving for Video Games and some CD's so not worried about it cracking further) the backing was not easy to get on and I'm pretty sure the nails split some of the boreds a bit making this bookshelf even less sturdy. It works for what I need and it looks good, perfect for what I need it for. I would not recommend buying this shelving unit at full value if you want it, don't waste your money. I have a lot of these kind of furniture pieces in my house and this is by far the cheapest feeling one I've ever purchased.",
