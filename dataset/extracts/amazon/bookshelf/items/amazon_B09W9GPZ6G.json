It was easy to put together but had a lot more parts than I expected so it took me longer than I thought. The pipe is real metal and I\u2019ve had no issues with paint peeling or chipping when putting it together. The only thing I found annoying was making sure the top u shape was straight. While tightening the sides it was never even so eventually I had to loosen one side and just push it on the ground to make it even. I would also recommend different furniture sticker pads for the bottom. I have laminate floors we plan on redoing so the pad being thin and possibly leaving marks is okay. But if you have floors you care about spend the few bucks and get thicker ones.",
