It\u2019s able to hold my heavy PC without a problem. The only issue I ran into was the drawers not wanting to stay on. There aren\u2019t any holes for the top of the hinges, so it just kind of falls out sometimes. Pretty easy to put back in though so I don\u2019t care. If you care more about usability than aesthetics, you could probably buy a better shelf with this much money. But it is a really cute shelf to me !! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

There were 2 very small imperfections (no big deal) the panel on the back was 3 pieces, I thought it would be one that was folded (again, no biggie) but there was one piece that I couldn't figure out what it was for. The assembly was very simple and the instructions were straight forward but I still couldn't figure out what that piece was. Overall, this is perfect for us. Well worth the price.",
