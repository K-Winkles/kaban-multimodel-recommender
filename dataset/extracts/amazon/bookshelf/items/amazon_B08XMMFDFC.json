                "reviewText": "I really like this book case and needed it in my crafting space to hold all of my newly acquired watercolor books, coloring books, and drawing books, etc. I was running out of space. It comes in a small box - smaller than you'd think for a book shelf you have to put together, and assembly is easy (no), complicated (not exactly), required attention to detail (yeah, that's it.). I don't think there wasn't a shelf that I didn't have to unscrew and readjust in order set everything right, but it did all come together well. It is sturdy, but I do recommend anchoring it if you can, especially if you have lots of book. Also I would recommend you put your largest and heaviest at the bottom and work your way up. All in all, I'm glad to have it, and if I had more room, I'd get another.",

Not sure it\u2019s going to continue leaning forward or attaching it to the wall will stop it. The base is a little small for the height of the product, which makes it wobbly. I highly recommend attaching it to the wall. We will keep it because my son likes it and it gets the job done for now. Putting it together was pretty easy.",

I I thought it was very unique looking compared to all others. As you can see in photo it stores great amount of large hard back favorite books. You can't beat the price either, but great deal! I actually have two. When the box was delivered I opened it and inside was another box labeled Computer Desk. I never bothered opening it because I assumed it was wrong and called customer support right away and they shipped out another box. I This time again box said computer desk but on this side was outlined picture of the correct book tree shelf. I missed image on first one. I I was happy so I got to keep both. I had two different male friends put them together. Like most men they refused to read directions. Lol stobborn. I they both started adding shelf to back one at a time and it was tricky. I read instructions and pictures showed to assemble bad and back, but put all the shelves together in zigzag fork. Then you add the shelves as a whole to base and back.For some reason both had one back screw unable to go in. However it was very sturdy and I was couldn't wait to put my books on display! I am overall satisfied.",
