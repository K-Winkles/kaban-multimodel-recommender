They were just what I needed for my tiny office to have more room for my books. They were easy to put together. Like all assembly require pieces, it\u2019s not fun but wasn\u2019t difficult and worth the hassle once you get it together.",

                "reviewText": "WARNING! You will NOT assemble this with the L shaped allen wrench they provide. The screws that go thru the bracing into the wooden shelves have hex shaped grooves that ARE TOO SHALLOW. The wrench will keep slipping out of the screw as you tighten and in the process begin to strip it out. Fortunately, I had a Black & Decker electric screwdriver and a set of hex heads for it. The 5/32 head is the one that works. That said, you will still need a bit of elbow grease to put this together. PROS : This is a fabulous bookcase! It is well made. The sections fit together perfectly. It is super sturdy and looks great. This is exactly what I was looking for and would buy again. Note to the manufacturer: Even if you deepen the hex holes in the screw heads it will take an enormous amount of physical effort to drive the screws by hand into the wooden shelves. Advise shoppers they will need an electric screwdriver + 5/32 hex head.",
