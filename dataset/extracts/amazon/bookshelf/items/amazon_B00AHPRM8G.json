That being said, the overall quality of the product and value for your your money make this bookcase a great purchase.

These are about equal to IKEA\u2019s cheapest bookshelves, maybe a little sturdier than that. They\u2019re also a real pain to put together, even compared to Ikea.BUT THIS IS A FIVE STAR REVIEW! I\u2019m giving five stars because these are absolutely great looking shelves, and they\u2019re a good value for the money. If you wanted solid wood shelves you wouldn\u2019t be reading this review. The cardboard backing looks awful but you won\u2019t see that when the shelves are full of books. This is one of the best furniture buys I\u2019ve ever made on Amazon, I like these better than anything else I\u2019ve ever seen at this price point.",

                "reviewText": "The instructions are excellent, among the best I've come across, but that only goes so far when the product itself is cheap and collapses in upon itself.The five shelf bookcase is basically two parts: a three shelf upper bookcase, and a lower two shelf bookcase. You would think that they would secure themselves together solidly, but no. They are connected cams, the dowels of which just loosly friction into the cheap particle board. It cracks and bends when trying ti assemble it, making it nearly impossible to line everything up.The only sturdy part of the build are the back panels, which have to be nailed in. They are so sturdy in fact, that when I finished putting everything together, and the bookcase buckled under its own weight, the back panels and the nails tore right through the cheap a** particle board and ruined any hope of salvaging the build.I had been told that Sauder was a reputible brand, but I am extremely dissappointed in the quality of product I recieved.Your mileage may vary, but I would choose something else.",

                "reviewText": "I just moved for grad school, and was looking to get 2 bookshelves on a budget. At the time it wasn't possible to get IKEA bookshelves, so I figured I would get 2 pairs of these bookshelves, based on the review. I then spent about 8 hours of hell assembling this bookshelf. I ended up returning the 2nd one without opening the box. I would've returned the 1st one as well, but by the time you're about half way through building this any return would be pretty much impossible.The instructions are rather opaque and incredibly unclear. I found myself staring at them for quite a bit before I knew what to do (and sometimes that wasn't correct. With the way you are meant to set this up you must build this incredibly heavy bookshelf upside down, while simultaneously connecting the trims it has. These trims don't actually fit snuggly with the bookshelf (see photos above), which is aesthetically unappealing (kind of counter to the whole point of the bookshelf). Because the wood is not finished on the shelves, removing them would leave a bunch of unfinished board. The trim on the bookshelves is also incredibly hard to slide on. I ended up using a mallet/using as much downward pressure on the trim as I could to get it into place.If it were just the aesthetic part of building this that was the problem, I probably would have rated it a 3 & returned the 2nd one.The bookshelf is basically 2 parts, rather than 2 long boards. Somehow the dowels, which are meant to connect the top part of the bookshelf and the bottom completely stripped, leaving me with a bookshelf that was splitting basically down the middle. By soldiering through & attaching the back I was able to lift up the bookshelf without it splitting apart entirely, and then I got up on a step ladder and shoved the dowel and hole into place using my weight to force the pieces back together.Even if built professionally, I'm not sure how one would deal with the issue of the trim. You can kind of put the trim into place so from afar you can't see the problems, but that's honestly such a strange design choice to me.",
