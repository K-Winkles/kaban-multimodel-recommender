I put mine in an alcove I have in my tiny closet to provide me some extra storage for purses and sweatshirts etc. I'd put a pic up but the rest of my closet is still a disaster! ha ha. Regardless - nice purchase. My only critique is that on the outside the screws can be seen. They give you small white stickers to put over them to hide them but they don't fully match and the fact it is a sticker is a little cheap looking. I wish they had the little plastic plugs like other put together furnature has. That however is definitely not a deal breaker. This is a nice size, love that it is a little taller than most cabinets. Would buy another if I had more room!",

I would highly recommend double and triple checking to make sure you have ALL the shelves with little holes to screw the back on are in the back before you attach the top shelf to the bottom. It's very difficult to take them apart after they are put together. Remember this is made of press board and will not like water or lots of moisture. That said it works for me and it's pretty sturdy.",

But I bet with an extra pair of hands, assembling the entire shelf would be even easier. Its slim design, unlike other bookshelves, is perfect for my small room. Overall, a solid 5-star rating!",

I had a spot that would fit two of these perfectly, but now there is an awkward 2 inch gap because the size was wrong on Amazon.",
