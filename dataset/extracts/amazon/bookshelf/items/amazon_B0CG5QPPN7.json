                "reviewText": "I moved to a new apartment and lost the scattered but small spaces I used to for my book collection. It was nice to keep the similar ones next to each other, and I didn't want a wide shelf eating up all my floor space. When I decided to look into rotating shelves for the new place, I immediately ran into a problem: the height of Japanese art books and piano sheet music books. These are about a quarter to a half inch too tall for most rotating shelves.This shelf provides 2 unique solutions to my problem. First, the top shelf is completely open on top, so I can fill that whole shelf with books of any height. Second the lips meant for displaying something opposite the main shelf space is the perfect place to lay a tall book or three on its side (works perfect for long books too). My collection isn't huge, but thanks to these two features, all of my books fit with room for temporarily parking library books too. I even got my crazy 12in x 15.5in huge book on there, which was a problem even for regular shelves.Now I might put a mat or board underneath it later, as its sitting on carpet and takes 2 hands to spin due to the friction. That's not the shelf's fault though. I couldn't be happier with this shelf. All of my books have an easy to access home now. And the display shelves have turned my favorite books into decoration. The whole thing is sturdy and stylish. Even with my heaviest books on the top shelf, it feels solid, like it would be hard to tip over.If, like me, your book collection is 1/4 big books, this shelf will work well for you.",

The top shelf\u2019s open design accommodates any book height. It's sturdy and stylish and seems well-made. It really feels like quality on a budget.Assembly was easy, though it's slightly challenging to spin on carpet due to friction. You have to be careful not to make it too top-heavy, so put heavier items on bottom to balance it out.My daughter helped put it together and she thought it was easy enough. Really satisfied, would buy again!",

It's perfectly functional and it's held up about two months later with constant use.I pack this with me to shows for my job and I use it as a display for items for sale.The rotation is pretty much perfect, and is made even smoother/silent if you apply some grease to the swivel base.I love the rustic/industrial aesthetic, it goes well with any environment or venue. Love this thing!The shelves are reversible so if you want to have the backboards all facing the same way forward, you can do that. OR you can just not install the backboards at all and be totally fine. So there's a good bit of modularity here.",
