This shelving will need a lot of strength to assemble the parts together, especially the side frames. 2 separate side pieces should connect together smoothly to create one long side piece but it doesn\u2019t connect together smoothly. I felt like I was trying to shove a square peg into a slightly smaller square hole. As someone else suggested, use a rubber mallet if you have one. I didn\u2019t have one so I really had to use brute force to shove the pieces together. Once connected, it will be difficult to pull them apart should I ever need to disassemble.The plastic \u201cfeet\u201d also needed to be hammered in. While hammering it, a piece of plastic broke off and hit my face. Didn\u2019t realize I would need a helmet or face shield to put shelving together.One of the screws into a shelf also doesn\u2019t tighten, it just spins.The instructions won\u2019t give you a warning to make sure the holes to screw in the X-brace should both be in the rear and I was lucky enough to have done this correctly because there is no way I would be able to separate the 2 side pieces apart again if I had made that mistake. This type of furniture is typically disposable and not for long term use but I still regret the purchase. Not worth it even with the Black Friday discount.",

                "reviewText": "Good for an affordable small space shelf that is stylish and practical. I got the smaller one, see photo- it is a shorter shelf. Versatile, I could rearrange and use this as an open cupboard in the kitchen, a decorative bookshelf, or even a shoe/boot shelf. Would be great in a smaller home, apartment, or dorm.Look: white metal with light birch oak (?) wood is a pleasing combo. I like that it\u2019s not slanted, as many of the \u201cladder\u201d style shelves similar to this have tapered shelves.Assembly: okay. Not a lot to put together, so very few steps, fairly straightforward instructions. Could have had helpful hints. For example, I accidentally flipped the front on one of the sides, not realizing until later that the support beams in the back needed the holes to screw in. I just left it - you can see in the pic front right.I did have a problem sliding Part A into B for the metal sides. Mine got stuck and wasn\u2019t a perfect fit - but I used a rubber mallet to make it go in. Be careful, if your putting together solo, I caught some skin in when sliding together and got a little blister. Don\u2019t hurt yourself shoving them in! Use a tool!Overall it\u2019s a good shelf for the price, if you\u2019re looking for a simple nice looking shelf. Will probably keep it for a while and it will have many purposes over time.",
