                "reviewText": "If you have a smaller area but still need a bookshelf, this is the shelf for you. It has 5 tiers so it will hold lots of books, photos and misc. Items. 2 of the shelves have a back piece, with the others open on all sides. It is designed with a black metal frame that is cross braced for stability, and rustic brown wooden shelves that are very easy to clean. The unit is only 10.6\u201d deep so it won\u2019t stick out very far into the room. The shelves are 14\u201d long so it can squeeze into a small space. It is 55\u201d tall so it can accommodate taller items on the shelves. This bookshelf unit has a very simplistic design that would blend well with most any decor so you can use it almost anywhere. It would also make a great storage piece in a bathroom, too. I really like this versatile shelf. Lots of storage in a small space, and you also get an anti-tip stabilizer strap for safety.",

                "reviewText": "The shelf is nice and sturdy and holds a decent amount of weight as well. I like the rustic brown color and the paint is nice and even on the metal pieces which makes for an attractive piece of furniture. The adjustable feet are a huge plus as my floor is slightly uneven so I was able to adjust the shelf to have it stand level. There is also an anti tip kit included but I don't see a need for it as the shelf is very sturdy on it's own, especially if you put heavier items on the bottom shelves. One thing I will note is there are covers for the screws but if you install the screws properly they will countersink to far to allow the covers to attach. Not a big deal to me personally as I have items on the shelf that covers the screws anyways, the caps would just make the shelf no longer flat.",

                "reviewText": "The parts of this shelf have a nice finish with a smooth texture on the sturdy metal structure and a textured wood veneer. My shelf arrived packaged well with no visible imperfections. The metal structure is rigid with additional cross bracing for added support. The shelves are thick with a heavy feel, which is good for the individual shelf strength and the overall balance of the unit. Even though it is sturdy, its height and narrowness make it a potential tipping hazard. I recommend using the wall anchor kit if children are around. The leveling feet are nice to remove any wobble. This is a nicely finished shelf with a modern look and quality materials.",

                "reviewText": "This set of shelves wasn\u2019t terrible to assemble, but man oh man do they have some adhesive on the little numbered stickers. I had to use a scraper to slowly and carefully scrape the stickers off each piece after it was assembled. I\u2019m not sure why they had to use industrial glue type of stickers, but somehow there wasn\u2019t damage to the surfaces (metal and wood both) after removal. Aside from that frustration, I really like this little shelf. It\u2019s compact and fits into smaller spaces, and in my opinion, makes the space feel a bit larger. I have it in the corner of the hallway where anything bigger would be awkward to walk past. Two of the shelves are just over a foot tall, and two of them are just shy of a foot. The whole unit is around 4.5 feet. The circular shaped feet at the bottom of the unit rotate to easily adjust for uneven flooring.",

This makes a huge difference when putting it together. I assembled this by myself in about 30 minutes. It comes with a small screwdriver, but I would recommend using a full size one.

I call that attention to detail.The shelf might not be super ideal for many books, as there are no sides, just a pair of x bars overlapping the bottom 2 shelves that kind of hold books in when placed vertically. The shelves are not very long and may not effectively hold book ends without having them pushed over onto the ground.",
