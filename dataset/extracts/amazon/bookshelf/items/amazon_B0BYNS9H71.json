Not able to find one single unit in the right size, I settled on these, and how lucky I was! These are perfect. They arrived really well packed. They are really sturdy. The shelves are flawless on each side, so it doesn't matter which side you put up. These were so easy to assemble. I made a mistake on the first one, so that one took an hour. The second one took me about 45 minutes. I have the black and white and the white isn't a bright white. It's more of a soft white (but not cream, still definitely white) that looks great with all my decor. The softer white color of the shelf actually makes it look more expensive. I am just so impressed with how sturdy these are, how great they look and how easy they were to assemble, all at a really good price.",

It came with a small real screwdriver for assembly, which is now my kitchen junk drawer screwdriver, so now my husband can have all of his tools back in his toolbox. The shelf is sturdy and compact. Fits in the small space I needed it for and compliments the darker hardwood aesthetic we have in our living room.",
