                "reviewText": "This is a pretty nice shelf rack. I would have given it 5 stars, but the placement of stickers was infuriating. Before I get into the sticker issue, the shelf is fairly sturdy, a tiny bit wobbly, but they do include straps that can be screwed into your drywall for securing and stabilizing. Good quality wood and instructions easy to follow. Just pay close attention to where the holes are in the instructions because there is a million screws and you don't want to get it backward... The shelf looks exactly as pictured, so I did not include a photo of that but included a photo of one of the stickers. If you are like me and hate stickers that don't come off easy, then you're in for a treat with this item. To make it even worse, they tossed the photographed sticker smack dab in the middle of one of the shelves. Took me 15 minutes to scrape it off and was still left with adhesive residue on the shelf. Oh well, there could be worse things I have to deal with. Don't let this stop you from buying, just add adhesive remover to your cart as well.... 8/10.",

                "reviewText": "As with most \"needs assembly\" furniture, the assembly instructions are minimalist line drawings without written directions. The drawings are adequate to assemble the Hzuaneri 6-tier narrow bookshelf but, with over 70 individual screws and fasteners, you definitely will need both patience and power tools. I found that for me anyway, it was easier to assemble the bookshelf by level (A, B, C, etc.) than assembling each frame side and then attaching the shelves. Kudos for including extra hardware (which I didn't need). All the hardware counts were exactly right. The bookshelf has adjustable feet (Part 101) which makes leveling the bookshelf very easy to do, too.",
