Takes about 20 mins to finish up if you\u2019re doing it alone. Otherwise I love it, doesn\u2019t look too cheap and can withstand the weight of my plants on top! It\u2019s very lightweight so building it in a more open space then moving to where you want it to be is really easy.",

Por eso se agradece el par de guantes tejidos que viene dentro de la caja, s\u00ed protegen de los accidentes menores que podr\u00edan suceder durante el ensambladoFinalmente , y esto es algo que tal vez solo a dos personas le interese, las piezas de pl\u00e1stico incluidas en el empaque est\u00e1n pensadas para ensamblar la estanter\u00eda solamente como aparece en la foto: el estante superior tal vez se pueda mover a la columna central si se prefiere pero no se puede poner en el lugar disponible en la fila de abajo para formar un estante de 3x3",
