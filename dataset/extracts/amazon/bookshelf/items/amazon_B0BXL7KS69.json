Another shelf like the first is too big for my room, but I found this shelf instead. It\u2019s sturdy and easy to put together. It matched very well to the original shelf too, and made for an overall great finished look in that room! At first glance, the box looks too short to be the correct height of this unit, so I thought I had been shipped the wrong thing. But, the two sides come with detached legs that once attached, bring the shelf to full height.",
