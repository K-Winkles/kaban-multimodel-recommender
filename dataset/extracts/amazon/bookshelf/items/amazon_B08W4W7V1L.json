But I took a chance and believe me, I\u2019m very glad I did!Some reviews complained about difficulties when putting the unit together, but I had absolutely no issues. It did take me about an hour though. Once assembled, I was very pleased with the purchase. With the weight from over 400 albums, this unit answers the call. No signs of sagging or bending as it\u2019s rock solid! And looks good, too!Put aside any hesitations you might have on purchasing this shelving unit. You won\u2019t regret it!",
