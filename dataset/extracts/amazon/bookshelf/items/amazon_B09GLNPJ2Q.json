                "reviewText": "The aesthetic and size of the bookshelf is great.It is a little wobbly on carpet but ones it's been loaded from the bottom, it seems to be pretty solid. It also comes with two small wall mounts for extra sturdiness, but have not needed it so far.Putting it together was simple enough and come with small tools Incase you don't have any, although I preferred to use my own.Overall a solid purchase.",

                "reviewText": "Pretty easy build, looks great as a whole, and very sturdy once everything is together. Unfortunately, it has some quality issues. Several dents, scratches, damaged corners, and uneven connections. Mine was also short one bolt, but luckily I happened to have one from another build that was the right size.A couple of build tips:1. Keep in mind you\u2019re building the shelf face down. The instructions will label the side shelves as left and right, and that might confuse you if you think you\u2019re building it face up.2. While the final build is quite sturdy, the pieces are just particle board, so don\u2019t screw the bolts too tight or you\u2019ll crack it.3. Instead of using the included wall anchors and putting holes in your drywall, just use wall hanging adhesive strips. The weight is well distributed, and it\u2019s not that big, so adhesive strips should be more than enough to keep it in place.",
