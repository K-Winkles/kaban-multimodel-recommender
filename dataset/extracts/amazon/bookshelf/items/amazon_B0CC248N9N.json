                "reviewText": "I like the sturdiness of this bookshelf and how it actually used a thin MDF board for the rear panel unlike some other bookcases that essentially have heavy cardboard. Overall I like the bookcase and it was easy to assemble. It uses a dense pressboard covered in a veneer foil. Be aware that only the 2nd and 4th shelves are adjustable. The top middle and bottom are fixed to maintain the structure of the bookcase.For the price of this bookcase I would have like to see some higher quality control. My bookcase had some marks and damage to the foil on the boards that makes up the back panel. While I'm not happy about the problems, because this item is so big and heavy and I don't' want to dismantle it and ship it back for a replacement (and it shouldn't be visible after we put the books on the shelves)Also be aware, they packed the bookcase well for shipping but that means that they use A LOT of styrofoam to keep everything safe during transit. I would personally prefer to promote companies that use alternative materials shipping materials that are more ecologically minded. All the styrofoam took up nearly half my garbage can.",

                "reviewText": "I love reading and have tons of books. And while I have a kindle (that I also love), I still enjoy the feel and smell of a great book. As a result, I have large bookcases that cover my walls in my library and a smaller one in my bedroom. Unfortunately, they are full, so I started stacking them on my nightstand. When I was offered the Vicllax bookcase, I jumped on it. How could I resist, getting it would mean more room to continue my collection! I love the color which is a rich expresso. It has the traditional 4 shelf design. Assembly was simple (took less than 30 minutes) and required only a screwdriver. It is perfect for books, magazines and knickknacks. It could also hold DVDs and even a few plants. Overall, this is a pretty nice bookshelf that has a lot to offer. It looks great in my family room. I\u2019d recommend it.",

                "reviewText": "I use to have bookshelves when I was younger, but then I grew up, moved, lived life, and finally now that we're in our own house, I got to pick my own bookcase for my room again and I Love it! It looks great and I have tons of books to unpack and fill it up with. It was pretty simple, quick and easy to put together and set up with following the instructions and such. We did need a couple tools to put it together and it has 4 shelves with 1 of the shelves, the middle one, is fixed and the top and bottom shelf are flexible and adjustable. Another feature that this bookcase has that we thought was a great thing is that it comes with and has an anchor kit for securing it to the wall to prevent tipping over, which is a very good safety feature and necessary thing to have and consider especially with kids.This is an awesome bookcase that looks really nice, is sturdy and good quality and comes with the handy safety feature of the anchor kit. If you're wanting or needing a great bookcase, then make sure to check this one out.",
