The instructions are pictures with numbers. However, I would get the boards turned around several times. Once I figured it out, I was happy with the outcome, and it serves its purpose for providing a vertical storage area for my cookbooks and a small area on the counter. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs vertical storage for books. I did not use the anchoring screws that came with it. That is my personal preference though.",
