                "reviewText": "I love this shelf so much. It matches another one I have that\u2019s bigger. My only complaint is there are no bars on the sides to keep books held up so I have to keep them completely in the front or completely in the back and use the posts as makeshift book ends. Other than that, I love this. It was easy to put together and so aesthetically pleasing.",

Bought the narrowest one for next to my desk, and I've liked it enough I'm buying three more for other corners of the house. The literal only downside is the stickers they use to ID pieces don't peel off super cleanly, so make sure the side of the shelf with the sticker is hidden (either by books or by facing it down on a lower shelf!) You'll also for sure need bookends due to the lack of enclosure on the sides, but that's hardly the end of the world.",
