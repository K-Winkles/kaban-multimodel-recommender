                "reviewText": "The shelving came ahead of schedule which was great and the box was in good condition when it arrived. All of the pieces were packed well and everything was there.....EXCEPT.....one of the little screw holders on the frame where the back support goes was missing! It was an item that was inserted at the factory. I don't want to deal with returning the entire item and have to wait for the new one. We will probably have to anchor the shelf to the wall which sucks. This is a nice product but it's disappointing to have a missing piece. That is why I gave it 4 stars .",
