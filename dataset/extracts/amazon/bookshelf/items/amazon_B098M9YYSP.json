                "reviewText": "The package comes with everything you need to assemble it--even a little screwdriver! Assembly was really easy and only took a couple minutes. The reasons I chose this bookshelf/bookend above others include...(1) With the tilted shape, it is automatically \"adjustable.\" It can hold a single book without it falling over, or it can hold as many books as will physically fit on the shelf. Many adjustable bookend options looked promising, but with the number of times I knew I'd need to take books out to use them, I also knew I'd get tired of adjusting it so things would stay upright. This design makes it easy to take four notebooks out at once without anything sliding or falling.(2) Another advantage of the tilted design is that I can store pens/pencils underneath the shelf at the part where it is raised. And that just helps me keep things tidy.(3) The unit comes with protective stickers so I don't have to worry about the bookshelf scratching the wooden furniture it's sitting on.Because I'm using this shelf for notebooks and books I frequently need access to, I can't stress how handy the utility of its design is, and it looks really nice, too!",

                "reviewText": "Absolutely ingenious idea! It would be great if they were offered in more sizes. The end support is about six inches high and hold average books and journals nicely. Taller, thicker books aren\u2019t really suitable because they slide somewhat and compress the smaller books. If the back support were taller it might give larger books a better chance, but it might tip over since the shelf is short and overall it is lightweight. This little thing can fit anywhere and is much more convenient than stacking. However I do use a weighty knick-knack as a bookend to keep thinner booklets from sliding down. I will look around to see if someone offers additional sizes. The stand is attractive as well, not so bulky as other table top bookstands.",

                "reviewText": "Simple design and bamboo wood are visually pleasing. There are few parts to assemble. Books cleverly stand up on this slightly slanted bookshelf. Be a little careful when removing a book from a full shelf or a bunch of books may fall off the higher end which has no bookend. It's nice that a mini Phillips screwdriver is included for assembly, but its threads stripped off before the job was done. (That's a pretty common tool many folks will have on hand.) Seems like a reasonable value and I'm happy to have it.",

                "reviewText": "OMG.. The screws... seriously??? The images associated with this product were screws that required a phillips head screw driver to connect the pieces. So as someone else mentioned before.. the hex screws stripped completely within the first few tries.. rendering the item useless. Unable to secure the screws.. I was so pissed I tossed it... I should have returned it and got a refund. There is no doubt this product would be perfect... but really frustrated by the false advertising",
