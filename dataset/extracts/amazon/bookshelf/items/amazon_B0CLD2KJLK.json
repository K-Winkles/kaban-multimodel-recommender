And, because I have none, when I walk out of the library it\u2019s usually with a tote jam packed with hardcovers (never mind the 30+ purchased books waiting for me at home).Library books though I keep on the small desk in my room and it wasn\u2019t long before I had a small replica of the leaning tower of Pisa. A quick search on Amazon and, et voila, problem solved.This is a sturdy little thing and the perfect size if you want to place it on a desk.The one con would be that apparently it was not the easiest to put together, but I handed that task off so I can\u2019t confirm nor deny \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude43",

It wobbles at the slightest movement. The back is 2 parts and is connected with a thin metal plate, which isn't sturdy either. I have a feeling I will have to replace the metal plates in the back eventually.Also, the stickers are an absolute PAIN to get off. Had to use acetone.",

I have 4 of these and only one has had this happen and the others are also the same for bending but not as bad. I checked if anything was loose but it is not. I do enjoy these and are a cute design and are sturdy so there is no doubt about that. But just be weary about this for long term use.",

The instructions are easy to follow. There are a lot of screws, and you might think you need a third hand to assemble, but I did it by myself, with arthritis in both hands, so I think anyone can do it. Everything lines up as it should. Screws, holes, everything. I really love that, since you are always taking a gamble when you buy something unassembled. lol I really like the look of it. It looks a lot nicer than the photo shows. It also has the cute little drawer in the bottom that is actually quite large. This part you do not have to assemble, it is made of thick canvas and comes folded initially, fitting perfectly in the bottom once assembled. Highly recommend!",
