I have a lot of projects and books, so I needed everything to fit on these shelves for easy access and to have my hobbies in a central location.I am in the market for yet another bookcase for my closet cause, what can I say - I have more stuff lol. That led me back to this one and I noticed, that I had not written a review of this great product.Assembly was easy for me cause I like to put stuff together and they provided all the hardware needed. I love the industrial look of the bookcases and shelving is great. The shelves almost look distressed which is another plus. I did not need the bit offered to attach the shelves to the wall, because the cases are very sturdy in my opinion. Because I was mindful of what I was putting on the shelves, as you can tell after 3 years there is no sagging of the shelves and a few of those shelves is holding quite a load. I love them and would highly recommend.",

                "reviewText": "This bookcase is very solid and sturdy. Heavier than I thought it would be and well worth the money. I didn't need to secure it to my wall, but kept that hardware just in case. It is completely loaded with books and DVDs/Blu-rays and is totally stable. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5, is while the assembly is pretty simple, the instructions are vague. And the only issue I had was trying to attach the stabilizing bars across the back. They weren't long enough and I had to use a small pry bar and then start the screws at an angle to get them in. But I got it together and highly recommend this product !",

                "reviewText": "I love this product! I spent several months searching for the perfect shoe rack that was deep enough, sturdy and adjustable to hold my shoes and be fashionable enough to be seen in my open laundry room. My search ended with this one. Each side bar is drilled for the shelving screws which enabled me to space the shelves out for my specific shoe needs, based on shoe heights with boots versus flats. I bought 2 complete units to have enough shelves for my shoe rack and still have enough for my office shelf. I used 8 shelves on the shoe rack and the remaining 4 shelves (12 shelves total from the two units combined) to complete the two shelving systems. Each unit comes with 6 shelves. The unit is well built and so attractive. The shelves are the perfect depth for my size 9 shoes. I have 37 pair of shoes or boots on the unit and another 4 pair on the floor under it\u202641 pair of organized shoes beautifully displayed!! The office unit holds the heavy binders and books nicely with no sagging from the weight of them. I highly recommend this product.",

They are very durable and nice looking. They don't look clunky and heavy like other book shelves. I love that you can move the shelving to customize the look for your needs. The shelves hold more weight than the other book shelves I had been looking at and at a way better price. You can adjust the bases so that you can make sure they are level or in our case tilted back a little so if my kids get rambunctious around them, we don't risk any of my lighter collectable pieces that are between the books falling down. We've anchored the shelves to the wall but it's still a nice added feature. I highly recommend and will be buying another one for my book nook once I've filled the last one in there!",
