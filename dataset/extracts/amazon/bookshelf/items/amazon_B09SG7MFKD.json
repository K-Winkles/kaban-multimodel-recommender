                "reviewText": "After reading other reviews I was nervous to assemble this but it was pretty easy, took me about 90 minutes and I did the screws by hand because I didn't want to mess it up by using a screw gun and getting over zealous. Although the instructions tell you to just partly screw the screws in as you go, with the step by step it is totally ok to screw them in tightly as you go. I got the blue one and it is beautiful, no flaws, I love it. The drawer is a little bit loose but like someone else said, I think with some glue around the posts that are on the front plate of it, that it will be nice and last me for many years. Someone else mentioned that they put felt on the underside I think so i will do that too for a smooth opening. This is a cute item, I would buy it again!",

The the wood and the finish suck. The product came damaged/ chipped it had a lot of imperfections. I order it white because I plan do make it my own by using some peel and stick design paper. The instructions are a nightmare but It\u2019s not my first rodeo. That\u2019s all I have be careful during assembly!",

I did think that the yellow maple color would've been more saturated in color but the pieces are more of a natural wood look which I really like anyway! Ideally, this bookcase would be wider and taller but a pair fit really perfectly in my space and brings a lot of character to it too.",
