                "reviewText": "This book shelf has so many uses. I have used it store my books, but also craft items, and office supplies. It is so versatile, depending on what I need it for. One of the aspects that makes it so useful is that it is mobile. You can choose to have it on roller wheels or stationary. I chose it be fully mobile at all times. It rolls super well on hard floor and tile and linoleum, but you really have to take your time and go slow on carpet. It does not seem to take up much space and fits well in smaller rooms. The rollers have brakes on them. I like this because my little boy can\u2019t move the shelf. It seems to have a sturdy frame and is stable.The only bad part of this bookcase is the assembly instructions. They were vague and lacking. There were two types of tools included by the company to put the stand together. There was no mention anywhere in the instructions that I would need a Phillips screwdriver. After struggling for over an hour, I finally asked my husband for help. He is mechanically inclined, and usually has no issues with assembly of even complicated items. He had to try to put it together two different times in two different ways. Finally, he said that we should just use common sense and study the photo on Amazon. He then put it together with the two included tools, a knife and a Phillips screwdriver.There was an extra screw and an extra lug nut. I hope they were supposed to be extra. If the bookcase wasn\u2019t so sturdy and a high quality product, I would have given it four stars for the instructions. Nevertheless, I would advise to not trust the instruction booklet. However, once it is assembled it is well worth the confusion and frustration to have such a unique, sturdy bookshelf.",

                "reviewText": "This small bookshelf is the perfect size for holding all of our kid\u2019s board books while also keeping them separate from our other books on our regular shelves. It is short enough that the 11 month old & almost 3 year old can reach the books themselves which is exactly what I was looking for. I do worry sometimes that a kiddo may fall into it or tip it over but so far we\u2019ve been okay. We do have it wedged between other things though so it\u2019s not sticking out at all. And it has wobbled a few times but stays upright. It comes with the option to use wheels or small anti slip feet & since this was for the kiddos we went with the feet for more sturdiness. The wheels do have a locking feature & seem nice but I cannot give an opinion on them since we didn\u2019t use them. Overall it\u2019s very nice, was easy to put together, does not seem flimsy at all, & can be used for a variety of books & other purposes.",
