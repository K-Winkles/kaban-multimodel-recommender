Hold a ton of books and even more storage behind the doors! I will say that the cabinet shelving is a little shallow, but definitely not a deal breaker! I love these!",

                "reviewText": "These bookcases were a dream to build. The instructions were very easy to follow and all the parts and pieces were nicely bagged and labeled, so it was easy to organize before building. I bought five and by the time I put the last one together it took me about 30 minutes. They fit nicely together to make a larger unit. I put them on the sides of a smaller shelving unit that holds our TV to create a large entertainment unit across an entire wall in our family room. I cut the base trim away and anchored these units flush against the wall and now have built in bookcases at a fraction of what it would have cost to build. They are very sturdy. The only complaint I have is that the screws that anchor the shelves show on the outside of the unit, so you need to buy plastic stickers to hide them. All in all we are quite pleased with how it turned out.",

Only realized once I added all my books how little room I had left (to my own surprise, buying this I was sure 60+ books were a little too much for an Amazon shelf). I\u2019ll definitely be looking into getting a second one when my collection grows, it was very easy to put together, given my lack of patience when it comes to building furniture, it was an hour or so job for me. I will say it is a bit messy out of the box, styrofoam bits and pieces, a little dusty too, a wipe down and sweep fixed it up nicely, just for warning. For the price though, I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth investing, it\u2019s a solid bookshelf if you\u2019re handy with tools.",

Really like the doors, it broke up the the look of the shelves and the style of the door is nice. They are not difficult to put together, it just takes time. I added some shelf liner to kick them up a notch and installed the liner as I put the shelf together. The shelves are stationary and they are on the shallow side. Would definitely recommend!",

The wood is good material but the top half of the shelf shows the metal screws on the inside and make it look very cheap. They should have provided something to cover them. Also, the anchor brackets to prevent the bookshelf from falling over are too short. I have molding and 1/4 round on my walls so the brackets cannot reach the wall. You definitely need to anchor the book case, it's not very sturdy and may tip over. Overall, the price was a bit high for the quality but, paired with the table, makes them look high end.",
