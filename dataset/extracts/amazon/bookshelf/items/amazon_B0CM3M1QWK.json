                "reviewText": "I recently purchased the Freexployer Small Bookshelf for my home office, and I must say, it's been a great addition to my space. I was in dire need of a bookshelf that could fit into my small office without taking up too much space, and this one fit the bill perfectly.What initially drew me to this bookshelf was its vintage industrial design. I'm a big fan of this style, and I knew it would add a touch of character to my otherwise dull office. And boy, was I right! The bookshelf looks fantastic and gives my office a much-needed personality boost.But the best part about this bookshelf is its functionality. With three tiers, it provides ample storage space for all my favorite reads. I can finally display my books in an organized and visually appealing manner. Plus, the freestanding open shelf concept makes it perfect for showcasing decorative items too. It's not just a bookshelf; it's a statement piece that enhances any room's aesthetics.All in all, I'm extremely happy with my purchase. The Freexployer Small Bookshelf is a true gem for those tight on space but unwilling to compromise on style. If you're looking for a functional and stylish bookshelf that won't take up too much space, I highly recommend giving this one a try. You won't be disappointed!",

Constructed with MDF Board and black metal, it's remarkably sturdy. While the size is relatively small, I use it as a shelf next to my office desk. It was easy to assemble, and its versatility makes it appealing as a side table, nightstand, or for use in the bathroom. Personally, I usually prefer shelves with a back panel, but the absence of one here makes this small bookshelf convenient for use with electronic devices, like alarm clocks, cell phone chargers, and lamps.",

This looks really nice and the lamp fits perfectly with a couple of little accent items. It looks really nice and fits this purpose well. I put this together myself and didn't have any problems. I think that the price point for this is really good and would generally expect to pay about 10-15% more for this were I to try to find a similar item in a store locally. I am pleased with this item and would recommend.",

She needed a place to put another of her plants and photos and this worked perfectly. The material seems to be of qood quality, was easy to assemble (minus some confusion with the back bars), and did not arrive with any specific cosmetic damages. This table/shelf is a good size that could easily be used for a variety of options (small entrance space, night stand, end table, etc.). My mom is very happy with the appearance and structure of the table.",
