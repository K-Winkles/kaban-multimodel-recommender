I finally got around to putting this thing together after a few months, and it\u2019s taken me about 2 hours of labor because most of the pieces do not fit with each other and take a lot of pressure to actually fit them. The instructions were abysmal, none of the parts were labeled, the cloth material around the shelves is made of really crappy quality plastic that holds static electricity and attracts pet hair. In the end I finally thought I had the dang thing put together, and the top shelf piece broke. On top of that it just looks plain cheap and warped.Save yourself a lot of headache and just save up some money for real shelves. They will be sturdier, look nicer, and last a lot longer. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m going to be able to use this thing, it will likely go straight in the trash, and it\u2019s too late for a return on it. Would give zero stars if I could.",

                "reviewText": "So, I picked this up, because I misread the description. (I thought it came assembled, which is on me.)Got annoyed about the assembly instructions, since they cover how to assemble half of a horizontal shelf. However, once I did that, it wasn't to hard to use intuition and basic math to figure out how to do the rest. (AKA you have 30 short poles. These vertically connect the horizontal shelves. The medium sheets cover each half of the horizontal shelves. The LONG Sheets wrap around 3 quarters, and the short sheets divide the horizontal shelves.) Took less time than any of my wooden shelving, and a lot less cursing. This is not to say I wasn't channeling Captain Howdy possessing Reagan in the Exorcist at various steps, but less than trying to connect wooden pegs in a normal wooden bookshelf assembly.It's not particularly as sturdy as a wooden shelving unit, but given I bought this mainly to house the YA and tween reading chapter books I found in Mom's attic during the cleaning of the estate, it's working well for holding old Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew/Tom Swift/Fear Street/Christopher Pike paperbacks. The bottoms isn't half bad at holding old hardcover picture books from when I was learning to read. So, yeah, will probably by another one once everything I've brought out of the basement is shelved.",
