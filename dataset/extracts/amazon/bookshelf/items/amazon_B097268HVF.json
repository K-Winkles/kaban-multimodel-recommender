                "reviewText": "Amazing tree bookshelf for the price! I was hesitant to purchase this product but after doing thorough research, comparing other similar bookshelves and reading the reviews I finally went ahead and purchased. I'm so glad I made this purchase - it shipped fast and arrived earlier than the expected date. I recommend choosing the option of shipping it in an Amazon box so that way it's more protected and people can't see what it is, otherwise this ships in it's original packaging and it shows exactly what's inside and it could be prone to damage. Once I took everything out of the box I saw what was included: the panels of wood, hardware for the setup and the instruction manual to assemble it. I was surprised to see the instructions were very detailed and had easy to follow diagrams and everything was numbered including the wooden panels. It doesn't take that long to assemble - it took me about 2 hours total because I have arthritis in my hands and wrists and not much strength to my grip so I made sure to take my time and screw everything in correctly. I included a picture of the finished product and do want to note that no pieces were missing I just preferred the open look on the bottom storage opening but you can either set it up like how it is pictured with the wooden back wall or if you want a more spacious and open look then you can choose to not install the back wall and just leave it open. I'm very impressed with the quality of the wood and there is no odor at all so I'm really happy about that. As you can also see I have already added books to my shelf and it fits a lot of heavy hardcovers; the key is to make sure you install the bottom feet/footing because it helps balance the whole shelf and makes sure it doesn't tip over. It also includes pieces to install wall mounting but for me it wasn't necessary. Overall I am very pleased with this bookshelf - it's unique and small but holds a lot. I highly recommend purchasing this - don't hesitate at all because for the price it's beautiful and well-made!",

                "reviewText": "I'm just a chick who doesn't usually build a lot of furniture and whose tools pretty much consist of a very old hammer, a rusty wrench and one power screwdriver that I can occasionally find in the closet. Therefore, I was really appreciative when I opened the Ruboka bookshelf and found well-labeled parts, included tools and, given some of the other nightmares I've seen since moving, pretty clear instructions. What a relief! Alas, some of the boards were lacking in the drilled holes necessary to properly build it. They weren't partially drilled so you could punch through them. They were just not drilled at all. So, lacking a drill or a new neighbor with a tool fetish, and not wanting to unbuild it and rebox it (egads), I just used the holes available. So far it seems reasonably sturdy even with the missing anchors and since it's only books and low to the ground, I'm willing to chance it coming apart one day. Fingers crossed.On the plus side it's a nice-looking display piece that doesn't take up much room and gives a few of your books a moment in the spotlight. If you're lucky enough to get one that made it through the drilling phase properly it could be perfect.",

They GIVE you the correct, easiest tool for each step, so needless hand cramps and frustration are totally avoidable!",

Assembling it wasn\u2019t too hard; the package comes with a small screw driver and things like that to help with the process. It took me over three hours because I was alone, I am not good at those things, and I made two mistakes. Other people may have an easier time, though. In the end, it got done, and I couldn\u2019t be happier. I have no complaints about it at all. (Also, for those into DIY, you could get the lighter one and spray-paint it.)",
