I do recommend putting the top and bottom shelves on first, then screwing in the other 3 in the middle, it will just help give some stability.The bookshelf itself stands fairly tall (not insane) I'm 5'3 and it comes right to the top of my head, with the top shelf around my chin's height. The shelves seem fairly sturdy, and it even came with anchors into the wall if you so need. Has so far held quite a bit of weight without any of the shelves themselves sinking. Overall definitely like this piece, and the price is well worth the piece/quality you get.",

It seems as though the shelving is cheap, will start bending under weight over time, and the screws barely even fit in the predrilled holes. That was not the case at all here.This piece was a breeze. All the shelves themselves had a high quality finish on them. They didn't feel cheap or hollow, they were very dense and sturdy. Best of all, I didn't have problems with ANY of the supplies or screw holes on the set. Everything on it fit together flush as it should.This item was a pleasant surprise, and I might actually even try to find some more pieces from this same manufacturer.",

                "reviewText": "I needed an extra shelf for the hallway to store things.This shelf was the answer! It was very easy to put together and included an allen wrench. I used an impact drill and made sure I was delicate to assemble faster.There are a total of 5 shelves which offers plenty of shelving to store things. The spacing between each shelf is also generous which makes storing things of multiple sizes easy.The shelf is tall and somewhat narrow but has a sturdy design!",

It actually looks as nice as it is pictured.It is easy to put together. Just be sure the holes for the cross bar are facing the same direction. The directions and assembly video on the seller's page points that out. I watched my 10 year old put this shelf together, and she made the mistake of not having the holes faced correctly.It's light enough for me to move around the house, yet it's sturdy and doesn't feel like it'll fall apart when doing so.The height between the shelves fits a lot of our Lego sets.",
