                "reviewText": "I really like the little bit of addition characters it adds to the room but the bookshelf is very, very light. It definitely requires the brackets provided to keep it anchored to the wall. It can hold quite a bit of books for sure, but do note that you cannot change the shelf height, which does create some limitations for my use, which involves some oversized music scores. I enjoy this, however, but it is better for lightweight and decorative uses.",

                "reviewText": "Really love the look of this shelf! It was the perfect piece for our space and matches the rest of our white furniture. The particle board shells have a pretty nice white laminate on them and the gold metal pieces don't look cheap. It was fairly easy to put together but took a bit of time. I was pretty happy with all the hardware, but there are a few seams where the shelf pieces come together were there are some minor inconsistent gaps. It's not a huge deal and not very noticeable, but it's sort of comes with the territory for a shelf this cheap from Amazon. Overall though, pretty happy with the quality, looks fantastic when all put together. The shelf does come with two brackets to attach it to the wall to prevent tipping. In the past i've not used these, but for a shelf like this with such a narrow base, we found that it was essential to use them even when the bottom shelves were loaded with weight. So definitely anticipate having to secure to the wall! Otherwise it's a great looking shelf for the price and we're very happy",
