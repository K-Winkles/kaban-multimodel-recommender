But the issue was he had to drill our own holes to make the support bars for the sides of the bookshelf to line up properly. I don't know if anyone else has had this issue, but we spent a hour drilling holes to make this work properly. The wood is weak and we placed a basket with about 2 lbs of fabric on the bottom shelf and the screw ripped through the wood. It wasn't well made for the money. Otherwise it would be a excellent choice because it looks great. I don't think some people would be able to drill their own holes to make this shelf work, as they may not have the proper tools. But also, it could have been a factory defect. All in all we didn't have a good experience.",
