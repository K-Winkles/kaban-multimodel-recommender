                "reviewText": "These bookcases are beautiful!. I purchased 3 for a space because the size would fit perfectly.Pros: beautiful finish. Cabinets at home depot don't even have this nice of finish.Easy to put together not a lot of parts.Dowels and pocket hole screws make for sturdy construction.Has more shelves than other units of its size.Cons: One had a Crack showing on the side. Not sure if it is just the finish as that is sometimes the nature of wood or if it will effect structural integrity of shelf. The damage may have been caused In Transport as the delivery person dropped them on my porch. I offered to help carry or to deliver to garage so they wouldn't have t walk up steps but they declined and dropped each on consecutively.Tips: glue dowels.The screws provided are not pocket hole screws that self drill so go slow or drive in a little and back out to create false predrill. Instead of putting together Flat lay one side on floor put glue in holes, add dowels, ad glue to top of dowels and place parts into side then insert screws. Make sure bottom and shelf are oriented towards the frontbor vack cirrectly there is a difference. Repeat by adding glue in holes of the shelf and supports sticking up then line up other side with dowel and tap into place and screw into place.Install top by laying shelf on its back.06 is top support 09 is bottom supportSuggestions to manufacturer: include pocket hole screws. And maybe touch up finish.Overall: nice product would buy again. Waiting for reply from manufacturer regarding damaged side giving it 5 stars for now. Will update if repairs and or returns become a hassle. Note that in photos it show shelf sitting flush to each other which is on of the reasons I purchased. This is not the case the top overhangs sides a bit so there is a gap when they sit side by side.",

The build process was pretty self explanatory except for the last bit where you nail the backing onto the back. Be careful that you place the backing in a place where there is enough wood for the nail to go into without poking through. The shelf distance provides adequate space for the items i want to present and the look of books on this piece is splendid. If you want a good ol bookcase to include in your room this one is for sure the one for you.",

These bookcases are made in Brazil, of softwood (pine) and well finished. Assembly was easy and everything fit properly. All you need is a Philips screw driver and a small hammer.Very pleased with this purchase. I think they represent good value for the money. Manufacturer should be commended for such careful and thoughtful packaging. I was really impressed. If I need another small bookcase, these will be on my shortlist!",
