It\u2019s so easy to build that it is also easy to not realize when you goof up. Took about 2 hours to build the shelf, and 30 mins to fix the mistake I made",

                "reviewText": "Unit was pretty easy to assembly and went together well. Once assembled I was impressed by the amount that can be held and displayed and appreciated the wide height between shelves which will allow for larger hardback books. The only callout would be that if you are going to display a lot of paperback books you will probably want to use bookends because items can fall between the gaps between the levels. Other than that very minor concern, which I was aware of, this is an excellent shelving system and very stable and solid.",

                "reviewText": "Ever since my dad took me to the Salvation Army in Washington, DC when I was a little kid, I've been hooked on books. We have a room in our house that we turned into a library - it's full. This bookshelf is currently in my 2-car garage (which was never used for cars at all!). The shelves in there are also full. (Okay, not just books - other memorabilia as well!) I use the \"Retreat Room\" for my new age passion. I collect tarot and oracle cards as well as every book imaginable on the subject. I ran out of room and this bookshelf spoke to me. SO easy to put together! It's extremely sturdy - as you can see, I don't have it hooked to a wall (no room!) I've promised myself that when this shelf is full...NO MORE BOOKS. (Will never happen, ha!)Honestly though - this shelf had very easy directions (pictures - always a good thing!) and as an individual, I had no problems putting it all together. The shelves are a beautiful dark brown and the racks are nicely powder-coated black metal. All in all, I am very happy with these shelves and can't wait until the weather cools a bit so I can spend more time in there!",

                "reviewText": "Despite some of the pictures from the other reviews, mine was shipped with virtually 0 noticeable damage. One board might have had a minor scratch, but overall it was fine.One note, the boards are a little darker than they appear in the photo. For me, it's a good thing, since most of my furniture is darker anyway.But overall, I'm quite satisfied with my purchase. It looks awesome, it's plenty spacious, and it'll be a wonderful addition to any home.I WILL say though, especially if you have pets, DEFINITELY plan in using the included wall anchors. I'm using my shelves for my board game collection, so it's got plenty of weight on it, and while it's sturdy ENOUGH, if you plan to use it for anything lighter and/or more valuable, it would behoove you to anchor it.Also, if you buy this and you're assembling it, don't 100% follow the instructions. When you're assembling the outer shelves, make sure you line up all of the available holes beforehand. The instructions gives a vague \"just follow these steps twice for each side,\" but that doesn't account for the holes needed to join the outer shelves via the inner shelf.",

Just make sure the right lettered metal pieces mate with the correct letters hahaha. I put the wrong ones together and couldn't figure out where I went wrong, super simple to figure out once I realized what I did though.I am not someone who can assemble shit easily- this was very stress free for me! The only real time consuming part is putting the back of the shelves on the shelves themselves. It's one screw thing in the middle so it will move back and forth at first till you get it tight. Screwing it in on the sides once you have the metal frames together sinches it all together nicely. I moved recently and have the basement room- this was fantastic for my space size wise and I was able to put so much of my stuff on it! Totally would buy again.",
