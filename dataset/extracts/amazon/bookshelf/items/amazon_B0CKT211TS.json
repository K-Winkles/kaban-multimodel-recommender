It was super easy to assemble, although it is nice to have a second set of hands to hold things in place while securing the screws. It took less than 15 mins for my daughter and I to have it completely finished. I love that the panels are clear so you can see all the books but keep them all secure for rotating. It fit perfectly on my small end table by the bed. I couldn't be happier with it. The rotating base came already assembled so the only things you need to assemble is the middle shelf, top board, and the clear panels on the sides. All the screws are exactly the same. Instructions weren't even necessary since it's all very simple. I LOVE it!!",
