                "reviewText": "As others have noted, the \"walnut\" color leans hard toward the red end, while not quite making it to \"cherry\", but I wanted that. There are also, as noted, a lot of finger-joints in the otherwise-solid wood shelves, but those types of joints are very strong and you don't see them once there's stuff on the shelves, plus it's more environmentally responsible and economical to not have to use big spans of clear wood. The finish/gloss isn't super even on the shelves, but it's easy to pick a better side and arrange the main shelves to see the best parts. Assembly was pretty straightforward, although the holes on the top shelf weren't as easy to align as on the other shelves, but getting all of those screws started and then incrementally tightening around and around got it done. The screw cover pegs just needed a little persuasion with a hammer to go into the holes (but use something in between to protect the peg finish). Once assembled, with the very long screws, the shelf is both relatively light and very sturdy - we have bottles of olive oil and balsamic vinegar loaded on one shelf and lots of cookbooks on two others, and it's been fine for the few weeks we've had the shelf. My biggest concerns were a strong wood finish smell right out of the box that dissipated quickly, and lots of vaguely-concerning small sparkly fibers that got everywhere when unboxing and assembling, but a damp-rag wipedown and vacuum of the area seemed to address those. This is an attractive addition to my kitchen that I expect to serve well for many years. And, bonus, the open back allows me to still access a light switch on the wall we wanted to put the shelf on.",

                "reviewText": "It was easy to put together but would recommend constructing the very top shelf and setting aside before adding the other shelves to the side rails. We did not notice but there definitely is a top and under side to the shelves; there is a beveled edge and the recessed bevel is the on underside which becomes more obvious during the instruction's last assembly step, which is to attach the top shelf to the 2 rails, that can can only be done one way, bevel down. We were going to leave the other shelves alone because I guarantee we would have been the only people to notice but the finish on on the actual topside of the shelves was smoother. But we took the advice of other reviewers and did not tighten the screws until everything was assembled so it just took a few minutes to reverse the shelves.There was damage to one of the side pieces but there was no external damage to the packaging. The thing that is not obvious in the product photos on Amazon is that the some of the wood slats are very soft, almost like a thick balsa wood. The break was in one of the \"X\" brace slats on the side, wood glue fixed it in no time flat; not worth boxing up, shipping back, and the repair is almost undetectable.I agree that for the price, this is much better looking than pressed wood bookcases that can be as or more expensive. Our needs were specific to the width because it needed to fit into a wall niche and after researching a long time over a few days, there were no other 5 shelf bookcases with decent height that were this narrow. It was perfect for our space. That made it worth the price. That said, the quality and weight of the wood, without the value of our need, would have made it seem overpriced as a stand alone bookcase.I loved that there were wall braces included. Any light-weight bookcase of this height needs to be braced if there are small children around.",

                "reviewText": "I purchased several of these little bookshelves after a recent cross country move where I had to let go of much taller heavier shelving units. They each took me less than five minutes to put together (using a drill) and I really like them! I\u2019d recommend a rubber mallet to get the wood caps in flush (carefully tap to prevent cracking or blemishes in the wood), and keep an eye out that the tapered edges are pointed the correct way on each shelf. Please note if you\u2019ve purchased similar looking shelves from World Market or other furniture stores these are not the same, as they are lighter in weight, and lower in quality, in my opinion. I\u2019ve included a pic of my brown World Market shelf next to one of these for comparison. I noticed a few minor paint blemishes on these as some others mentioned, along with fiber strands inside the packaging materials, so please use caution while unpacking. I\u2019ve included pics that will hopefully help others looking to get these. When the box is standing on end with the name up like in the pic it\u2019s the easiest and fastest way to access the instructions and screw set without having to open all of the packaging which helps reduce styrofoam and fibers getting everywhere. These little shelves have worked great for me and I\u2019m happy with this purchase!",

It is made of real wood, has a beautiful, deep rich color and it has a nice weight and sturdiness.The assembly instructions were clear and my daughter was able to put it together in less than an hour with the tools provided.I diligently checked several sites when shopping for this item, and Amazon beat the lowest price on those sites by over $30.A nice item for the price and it blends in beautifully with my other (more expensive) sitting room furniture.",

And considering I have a lot of hard cover books, this is a huge bonus. It\u2019s also quite stylish too. Although I personally didn\u2019t assemble it, I watched the person doing it and it was put together in less than 15 minutes. I believe that there is an option to anchor it to a wall for additional stability which I think is a great idea! This is a great lower budget option.",
