Turns quietly, seems stable to a point, and can store alot of books.*Do be careful if you have small kids and watch that you even the weight load around it because it can get top heavy and side heavy but making sure that the bigger books are evenly spaced on the bottom helps. Also it is best used on flooring that is not carpet.Overall however I am pleased with it",

                "reviewText": "This sturdy bookcase was easy to put together, once I purchased an electric screwdriver. There are 88 screws and they provide a teeny-tiny screwdriver that was painful after the first few screws. The only other problem was the fact that the hardware packet was missing 2 of the screws, so I have to make another trip to the hardware store. I was surprised that binders actually fit on the shelves, but because of the rounded shape of the bookshelf, you have to put a couple small books with them to avoid them flying off when you turn the bookcase. I highly recommend this product.",

It took me a few hours to complete it - with breaks for my fingers, along the way. 2nd picture shows how the Styrofoam absorbed the shipping process and protected the boards. I'm happy with my purchase and will likely purchase another, probably smaller though - I have sore fingers from the use of screwdriver - lots of screws!",
