It was packaged really well, came in two days earlier than expected, the instructions were very straight forward, and all the parts were clearly labeled. It came with two spare parts of each of the hardware and a decent magnetic screwdriver which is quite nice. It definitely needs to be anchored in which I haven't had the chance to do yet, it's a bit wobbly (but I also have carpet and funky floors so that's not the shelves fault).One thing I noticed that I didn't *love* were the dowels- the dowels are kind of thin and short compared the holes they were going into.I'd buy it again!Also- if you bought more than one you could connect them with the metal cross pieces in the back which would be pretty rad.",

I thought there is no way this big of a product fit into such a thin box. The box is heavy and tall so if you are smaller perhaps arrange for someone to be there to help lift it.Cons: Assembly space was required to be at least twice the width of the entire shelf to slide in the individual shelves. I\u2019m really just nitpicking at this point.My only gripe is every single piece of wood had a sticker on it to show what part it is. Great idea except they were hard to remove and left a sticky residue on the wood. That\u2019s like 32 stickers. I need to find a product that will eliminate the stickiness without damaging the wood\u2019s finish.",

But NOTHING INSIDE WAS BROKEN!!! They sure know how to pack them, I guess! It was prettier than I thought it\u2019d be. Very rustic industrial vibe. It was super easy to put together but took quite awhile with just one person. I think it\u2019s fairly sturdy. Big bolts, heavy duty metal, lots of screws per shelf. I\u2019m using it for games in the dining room on half, at least. Fits most great with the wider shelves than many. It\u2019s a lot of space and looks great for the $200 price tag.",

                "reviewText": "I've been wanting to upgrade the cheap particle board shelves I have. They always claim to support \"X\" number of pounds, but they NEVER do. When you put the books on them, they always slowly begin to sag or bend in the middle. And real, solid wood shelves cost significantly more.These have the metal braces that the shelves sit on. So, no sagging and capable of supporting weight.They are solid looking shelves, but I had to \"upgrade\" them to my standards. Modifying them a bit made them almost perfect for me. And they look so much better.As has been mentioned, the sideboard is only about two inches. Not much side support for books that are much taller. Someone mentioned using book ends. That eliminates shelf space. I got 1/2 by 1/2-inch dowel rods, matched them to the length of the sideboard, glued them together, and built up the height of the sideboards on the shelves along the metal sides. And stained them to match. (The sideboards are 1/2 inch wide; the dowel rod is perfectly sized). So now the side boards can support the sides of the books.I also had to stain the edges of the original board pieces. The edges showed the white of the particle board. The original finish did not cover the edge. This was my biggest disappointment in the shelf. That white edge looked cheap and crappy. But once I used a small art brush to stain the white edge, you could not tell.Saying that I had to put in work to make the shelf meet my standard, I am buying another. I like matching shelves, not have an oddball assortment. It will look good once I've modified it for what I want.",

You're probably going to want help bringing them inside.Assembly was pretty straight-forward. Directions were clear. A little time consuming, about an hour per unit to assemble. I would highly recommend completing the frame assembly before tightening any of the screws completely to give yourself a little wiggle room when trying to get everything to fit together.Once assembled, they're very sturdy and very attractive. A little on the pricey side for my taste, but probably worth it as I expect they're going to last a long time.",

If you are prepared with a proper electric drill, it's just perfect, no issues at all.Kits come with spare screws, tools, build instructions and it is very easy to follow.
