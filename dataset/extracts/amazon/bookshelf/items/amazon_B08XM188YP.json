I always worry about getting a package and having one missing screw or bolt -- but this manufacture sends an extra bag which contains extras of all the screws and dowels - I really appreciated that. My only complaint -- or I guess suggestion to the seller, has to do with the tags that are used to number and identify each piece- These are a real pain in the neck to remove, and on several of the wood(styled) pieces, I was unable to remove all the residue. However, I can definitely live with it - In fact, I liked this unit so much, I came back and bought the six shelf bookcase also",

The shelves are a gorgeous dark color and very strong. I\u2019m not concerned about the shelves bending due to weight. It took me about an hour to put it together and it was very easy. The box was packaged very well so everyone fit in a small space without damaging anything. The box also had a protective strip under where you cut open the box so that you didn\u2019t cut into the bookcase. I love the adjustable feet because they will prevent scratches on the floor and also allowed me to balance it. I would definitely buy this again.",

                "reviewText": "First I want to say that I love this bookcase. It\u2019s beautiful and sturdy- exactly what you want. It holds hardcover books well and I will definitely purchase additional bookcases as I need them as I am a book collector. However it took my two days to put this bookcase together because 3 of the screws stripped while putting together the shelves. You are provided all of the correct number of pieces and I find the instructions clear, but the Allen wrench/keys that come with the tools stripped the screws repeatedly to the point that I had to purchase new screws.I consider myself very adept at building furniture (I put together IKEA furniture without problem!) and actually enjoy it, so it came as a surprise that when putting the sides to each shelf together, at least one screw per shelf would have a problem. I couldn\u2019t finish putting it together because three of the shelves weren\u2019t completed. Once I purchased new screws and drilled them in (not Allen wrench ready) it was fine. So just a warning! Be careful using the Allen wrench.",
