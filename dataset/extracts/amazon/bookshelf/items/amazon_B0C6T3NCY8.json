And the slats on the side matched my daughters headboard in her bedroom. I bought this to put some books on. But the material is super super flimsy. I don\u2019t think I could actually put books on it. I put it together hoping I would love it but I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s put together like a puzzle piece. And then you put a bunch of screws in it. I would like to know what the weight limit is on each individual shelf. Because I don\u2019t think that I could actually fill it with books. It\u2019s a Dollar General quality shelf. And for $40 I think it\u2019s way overpriced for the cheap flimsy quality. If it was cheaper I might\u2019ve left it put it together and just see what would happen. But for $40 I took it apart and I\u2019m returning it.Also, there is no finish on the edges. It just looks like a spray paint finish. The sides of it looked terrible because of the puzzle piece design, and the ridiculous amount of screws.",

This thing was so flimsy I'm not even sure what the material actually is; reinforced cardboard, some kind of foam maybe..? The puzzle-like pieces 'push' together for assembly and one of them snapped before I could even get the screws in as the final step. (Good luck with the instructions, by the way.) I can't believe this is selling at fifty dollars, it's more like a ten-dollar product you'd find at the big stock stores. Overseas, overpriced junk.",
