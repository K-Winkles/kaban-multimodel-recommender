I liked how the sides are only 1 piece. The others I saw on amazon split it into two pieces I guess for easier shipping.It could definitely be a little sturdier, but it works and wasn't very expensive so can't complain.I saw another reviewer mention a sticker. unfortunately that it still true. it sticks right on the side and leaves a glue residue even after working to get it off. I almost removed a star for it...It only took about 45 minutes to put together by myself.",

Started putting it together and made it to the second to last step. The step where you literally are supposed to use tape to tape the back panel pieces together. I should have looked at all the directions before just starting to assemble it. And returned this trash. Butbi was already this far in. I use the 4 strips of tape they sent to literally tape this junk together then start to line up the last piece and the top holes aren't lining up look to be misdrilled. Try to get it to go together and literally hand tightening the screws cause this partical board junk is delicate. Get it together and start putting some books on for it to only collapse under an extremely light amount of books in the middle of the night. The particle board literally crumbled. I can't emphasize this enough don't waste your time or money on this. Crap like this should literally be blocked for sale on here. Would give a 0 review if I could.",

I'm giving an extra star for that.I was able to construct it ok without too much difficulty, but I could see how it would be hard for some to get it together as putting one shelf on the others along with all the backing pieces requires some serious balancing.",

                "reviewText": "I've put together 3 of these shelves with one more on the way. Out of the 3 1 had all the hardware loose in the box. The box had huge holes with the styrofoam comeing out so I'm surprised i didn't lose and screws. Another ((pictured)) had a large crack. The crack is only visible from one side and is covered by the shelf once constructed. Not useing these for load bearing so it's fine but definitely not good. Hopfully #4 is ok. Once they are together they are very nice hence the 3 stars. But quality control can use improving.",

It\u2019s a two person job to put together, but it\u2019s a great value to buy for the price. It\u2019s a well made product, doesn\u2019t look cheap, looks like real wood. It was well protected when shipped. Like for the price, it\u2019s way more than what I expected, it has a beautiful finish.",

                "reviewText": "I never review, but this project pissed me off so badly, I couldn't resist.This was the WORST bookcase I've ever had the misfortune of putting together: The instructions were a joke. There was no guidance or explanation when it came to installing the pieces front-to-back... normally, one of the ends would be grain so you can match them up uniformly, but with this piece of crap? Nope. EVERYTHING is solid, so you get to guess - and surprise, surprise, I guessed wrong. And you know how they always have that nice, easy backdrop that can be nailed onto the back? Not here! Instead, they thought it would be a hoot to give you 5 PANELS you have to jigsaw together with tape, making it IMPOSSIBLE to put together by yourself! Hilariously, the panels kept falling while trying to slot the top into place - which, OF COURSE, didn't fit, even after all the screws and washers were installed correctly, forcing us to slam the thing down with a hammer which pushed a screw right thru the cheap wood. And then, even when it's all done and standing proud, they couldn't even make the shelves easy to install. Oh no! Rather than slotting them into place like usual, they make you line them up and insert them into pre-drilled holes, which again, barely fit!! In the end, they didn't even give you camouflage tape to hide all the background screws AND after slotting everything together, there were still noticeable gaps where parts of the board didn't fit. This entire experience was a nightmare and I suffered bookcase rage for days following its installation!I swear, this manufacturer has never SEEN a bookcase, let alone knew what they were doing when they decided to build/sell one!! Please, for your sanity and my own, save yourself frustration and money and look elsewhere.",
