                "reviewText": "Wanted a corner shelf for my oddly shaped bedroom (there's a nook just beside the door, because of the location of closets for my bedroom and the adjacent room).This shelf belongs to the same set as a desk I bought earlier in the year, so it matches. Which is nice.It takes a while to put together. I think it took me about 1.5 or 2 hours, working alone.Fitment isn't super precise, but it's decently sturdy and straight once assembled.The shelves are made of MDF, as to be expected of furniture in this price range, so don't wrench the screws in as if you're tightening metal to metal. MDF is essentially cardboard. It's a decent material for cheap indoor furniture, as long as you don't abuse it. This is also not a shelf for climbing on or for storing heavy objects (like free weights). I plan to use it for books, seeds, art supplies, and other miscellaneous, lightweight items.I haven't populated this shelf yet as I'd like to move my light switch first and maybe paint the wall (I plan on repainting my bedroom), and also puchase some organizers and maybe some bookends. But it should hold up about as well as any shelf made from MDF (I have another MDF shelf with no metal components, in another room, which has held up for years. If used correctly and not kept in wet conditions, they hold up fine).",

This resulted in me having to partially disassemble it to flip a couple of things around.Other than less-than-great assembly instructions, I love it.",
