                "reviewText": "I LOVE these shelves and am so pleased with the quality. I literally almost cancelled my order after reading several negative reviews and am so glad I didn\u2019t. And I hate taking time for reviews but want people to see how great they are. They\u2019re super sturdy and can withstand the weight of all our books.I\u2019m using them as home school shelves. They\u2019re so much prettier than other cheap bookshelves- the trim makes it look way more expensive.Mine are true white- I know another reviewer received an off white but that wasn\u2019t the case for me.Other reviewers also said there were 6 individual, difficult back panels and plastic pieces. They must\u2019ve changed it because mine doesn\u2019t have that, mine has 3 wider pieces (and I\u2019m so glad there aren\u2019t the cheap looking plastic pieces on mine).It was time consuming and mildly tricky, but no different than any other build your own furniture.My only complaints are that you can see the silver screws on the inside of the shelves and there\u2019s a small gap on the trim of one shelf (all pictured in my review photos) but these wouldn\u2019t cause me to hesitate purchasing.The depth of the shelf itself isn\u2019t the full 11\u201d but closer to 10\u201d. The 11\u201d depth includes the trim that kinda sticks out. It isn\u2019t deep enough to fully fit every children\u2019s book, but as you can see in the photos I posted it\u2019s not a deal breaker. It does fit most children\u2019s books fully. It\u2019s very hard to find deep bookshelves that are also tall and these are deeper (and prettier) than like every other tall bookshelf I found (usually 9\u201d deep).I definitely recommend!! I\u2019ve gotten so many compliments on these.",

I don\u2019t love it, but by the time I noticed my husband had it halfway together. So, I\u2019ll probably paint it down the road to match my other trim and shelves properly. I\u2019m very annoyed. It was misrepresented, but it\u2019s too late now. Not to mention it claims to be \u201creal solid wood\u201d and absolutely is not. It claims the shelves are 1.5\u201d inches and they are not, they just have a facia board/trim. Literally nothing about this shelf is as advertised. In addition, it was extremely difficult to put together. Instead of a folding backing board, there are 6 pieces that are attached by slats that are near impossible to get all pieces attached to each other simultaneously, especially with the longer pieces that back the top. This thing is absolute junk. It\u2019s a $30 Walmart shelf with a bunch of misadvertisement that makes it seem nicer but it\u2019s not all all. Do not buy. It\u2019s awful and so not worth $95.",

                "reviewText": "Took me about 2 hours to do it myself, instructions say you need a buddy to help you put the upper half onto the lower half after you assemble them separately but if you want to do it yourself just assemble the upper half on top of the lower.A good chunk of that 2hr was putting in the back panels which are my only complaint about the assembly, the shelves on the back do not have predrilled holes so either drill them yourself or expect to waste a lot of time fiddling with screws.Overall the bookcase looks good and seems fairly sturdy, the shelves are held by 4 decent sized decent sized screws and 4 wood pegs, the screws go in about 1-1.5 inches into the shelf/walls and the pegs about 1 inch so these should be able to support a full shelf of books easily.",

                "reviewText": "I bought 2 of these to hold ... well books. The look nice when assembled. But when you put large books on the book shelves, 3 of the shelves develop a noticable bend immediately. That bend is about 1 cm at the center. Lightly loaded, there is no bend.Assembly was straight forward, with the exception of putting the back on the case. They have a cleaver design. Panels slide into a plastic connector. Unfortunately the fits between the panels and the connector is too tight. I assmebled two bookcases. One I actually had to sand down some of the panels to make them fit in the connector. In the second bookcase I got better at the fit and managed to do it without sanding. The instructions need to be improved on this last step.I will ultimately be replacing these bookshelves. In the mean time they are adaquate, even with the bending shelves.",
