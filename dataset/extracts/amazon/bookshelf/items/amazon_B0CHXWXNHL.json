Highly recommend !I liked the idea of the product but the putting together is not clear. It does not function fully on rug as once you start putting books on it begins to lean forward which can be a safety risk. I want to return it but then I would have to take it apart which was slot of work initially.",

                "reviewText": "There is no drawer in this bookcase; it\u2019s just a box at the bottom. Despite the absence of the drawer, this is a great little bookshelf and perfect for locations that need something that isn\u2019t very wide. It was packaged securely to ensure it arrived undamaged and easy for one person to put together. It came with an allen type wrench to be used for most of the screws but you will need a regular screwdriver for the back of the bookshelf (see photos). There\u2019s an anchor included to secure the top to the wall to make sure it won\u2019t fall over. The bookshelf itself is very sturdy, the only detractor is that the screws show on the bottom box part. When assembling, pay attention to how the holes look (the bigger holes are the part where the screwheads wind up) and the sides with the random looking little holes, all go on the same side and wind up as the back side. The instructions mention only turning screws half-way until others in place but I didn\u2019t need to do that until the very end when putting together the box/bottom. When assembling the bottom, it worked best to start all the screws and once they were all in place and started, go around and tighten them all up. This bookshelf made a nice addition to our collection of shelves for storing our books.",

It is a different look for a bookcase and is great for more compact spaces.Pros:~Holds a good amount of weight~Compact and tucks into small spaces well~Easily paintable~A nice looking display/decor pieceCons:~Exposed screw heads, no screw covers included~Floor needs to be flat/level. Thicker/uneven carpet might be a problem_____This shelf took a minute to put together! Not the easiest thing I've ever put together, but the end result is very nice. I have a smaller version of this style of bookcase and was excited to see a larger version. I like the way the books display in a different pattern than traditional bookcases. The unit itself is very sturdy, and it comes with an anchor for the wall, but if you are not putting it against a wall and your floor isn't flat, there is a chance it will topple.",
