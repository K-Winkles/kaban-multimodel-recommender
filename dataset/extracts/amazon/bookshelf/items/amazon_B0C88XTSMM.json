A tiny allen wrench is included, but your fingers will be very, very sore from assembly. The included screwdriver for the 4 cam-type connectors is small too, but fine for the job.Note: I ordered 2 and one was missing an item. Amazon Customer Service could only send a replacement and have me return the one with one missing item. No thank you! After spending all that time and effort, I will contact the manufacturer or go without (back piece on the base).",
