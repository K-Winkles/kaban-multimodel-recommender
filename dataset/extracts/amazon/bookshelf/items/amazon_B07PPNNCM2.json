                "reviewText": "\u2713 Package arrived on time and in perfect condition. No damages. No missing parts.Please note that this product is shipped via Ground and by \"on time\" I mean the normal amount of time it takes for Ground shipping (In my case it usually takes 6-7 days).\u2713 Material : Particle boards. Particle Wood Frame.\u2713 Quality: Great. Extremely sturdy!\u2713 All required Hardware are included. In addition to the included hardware, the assembly process requires a Philip screwdriver. I also used a 3.6V power screwdriver (from Ikea).\u2713 Assembly and installation: Hard. - The instruction manual contains only picture illustrations. It does not provide any worded explanation. But the illustrations are quite understandable. - The pre drilled holes are a little too small for the included hardware. This requires us to put in a lot of power and effort to install this bookshelf. I used a 3.6 V power screwdriver in certain steps during the installation and it saved me a lot of energy. - Even though at the end of the installation we get a sturdy and strong bookshelf, I strongly feel that the entire process could have been made a lot more easier if only the predrilled holes were a little bigger.\u2713 This bookshelf can be used as a stand alone assembly OR could be installed on to the wall. Hardware is included for both options. I opted to use this as a standalone assembly. For this, two blocks are included which need to be attached to the two hind legs of the bookshelf. This prevents the bookshelf from tipping over. But please note that if you are using this standalone option, the bookshelf is going to be protruding 3.5 inches from the wall.\u2713 So at the end, I've got a very strong and sturdy bookshelf after a long and tedious installation process. The exceptional quality and sturdiness of this product outweighs the problems encountered during it's installation. Hence I've given it a 5 star rating.\u2713 Dimensions;Overall height - 71\"Width - 25\"Depths of the shelves are as follows:Bottom most shelf - 13.5\"First shelf from the bottom - 11.1\"Second shelf from the bottom - 9\"Third shelf from bottom (second from top) - 6.8\"Top most shelf - 4.5\"",

                "reviewTitle": "4.0 out of 5 stars Fairly Sturdy",
                "reviewText": "Pros:It looks pretty from across the room. The frame is actual wood and has an even, glossy finish, while the shelves have a \"brown\" veneer that makes it less attractive (see photo). But once you get stuff on them, that veneer is barely visible. It IS pretty sturdy - I do not expect \"puppy parkour\" to knock it over even if I don't attach it to the wall. It has good height (I'm 5'5-1/2\" and it's taller than me), which is what I was looking for.Cons:This thing was a beast to put together. Be sure to grab a real screwdriver and (if you have one) a nut driver with a hex bit (they send an allen wrench) as the pre-drilled holes need a little muscle to get the hex-head screws in. Pro tip - install the wood pegs and cam studs FIRST, then drop the shelves into place and attach all the screws - yes, the second rail goes on AFTER putting the shelves on. Second pro tip: when putting the shelves on, put the top one on first and work your way down. The picture-directions show you putting screws in after you put the shelves on, but if you put the lower shelves on first, you have very little room to work when doing the next layer up, even if you put it together with it laying on its side because the rails are in the way. There are small brass L brackets used to support the FRONT of each shelf. Unfortunately, they are obvious once it's all put together. But the only thing holding the front of the shelves up is the cam and stud and they are very cheap and fragile, so if you don't use the support brackets and put something heavy on the shelf, you could end up wearing it. A real irritation - the seller put actual stickers directly on the wood on the outside of the sides. And while that's great for identifying which part is which, trying to peel them off will get you nothing but sticky stuff. Third pro tip - use WD40 on a rag to get the stickers off. Wipe the WD40 on and let it sit for a few moments. The sticker should peel right off along with the sticky stuff. I do not recommend using a blade to scrape it as the finish isn't the greatest and might be damaged, but if you're patient, it might work. I just used my thumb nail.Overall:It looks good from across the room and will do the trick, but it would almost be worth paying someone else to put it together!! LOL***Sorry the photos are sideways. Old photo software that won't allow me to put them upright! But they show the color of the shelves compared to the rails, the stickers, the L brackets and the overall finished product.",

Despite other reviews saying it was difficult to assemble, we actually found this to be one of the easiest piece of furniture we\u2019ve assembled, like less than 20 mins assembling! I\u2019m not sure if they changed packaging/instructions or what but I\u2019ll admit I was intimidated by reviews that said it was difficult only to find the exact opposite just my experience. It\u2019s not perfect as there were some very minor dings on a piece or two but again I couldn\u2019t beat the price and they were so negligible, I was more nervous sending it back and getting one worse. Very happy with this purchase!",
