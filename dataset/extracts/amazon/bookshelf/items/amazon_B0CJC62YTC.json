                "reviewText": "It wasn't super cheap or super expensive. For the price it does the job well. Instructions were simple. And correct. Not bad on quality. The only thing I noticed when putting it together was some of the screw holes were very close to the edge causing a slight bubble if you put the screw in too far. It is on the back side though.My only markdown on rating would be that the bottom drawer appeared to be an all wood drawer. It was actually a faux wood panel on a canvas drawer. I'm sure that was stated somewhere in the description that I didn't read in detail. Actually works better in a way, because you can remove it as it just sits atop the bottom shelf.",

                "reviewText": "The product description is 100% correct with the measurements. I assembled this shelf in 2.5 hours, and the .5 hours was mostly me goofing off and watching television. It was incredibly easy to assemble. It's sturdy but lightweight enough to move by one person and it holds over 20 pounds of items. The color of the wood in the product image is accurate as well, so for anyone looking to match the wood to another piece of furniture you own or are looking to get, the photo is accurate! I really like this new addition to my office corner. For the price, I'd say it was 100% worth it, given that it comes with a basket/drawer at the bottom that you can place on any of the shelves interchangeably.",

I really like the industrial look of the dark \u201cwood\u201d & metal frame. Essentially, I am very satisfied in almost all respects. One note. The \u201cdrawer\u201d is a flimsy one-piece thing with a wood front & fabric sides . It won\u2019t hold a heavy load. However, since it just rests inside the shelf without a track, you can omit it if you like.Otherwise, this is great for those tight spots & corners.",
