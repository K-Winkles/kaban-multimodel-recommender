I did it myself but 2 people could go a lot faster. It took me about an hour to get finished.You get all the tools you need but I do recommend a hex driver set if you have one to make things easier than the provided Allen wrenches. One of the sections seemed to be uneven but didn't notice it after I connected them. The crossbars are a bit easy to bend as well so be careful.The presentation looks nice and clean and it matches my other furniture.",

This shelf looks very nice in my gaming room and showcases my personal favorite toys. It is amazing how the look of this unit changes the whole room. Another feature I like is the ability to buy another unit and merge them into a larger bookcase.Putting together the bookcase was easy enough for me to do by myself. It is sturdy once assembled. It is not too heavy, but it is stable enough to hold books or fragile collectibles. I plan to buy a second bookshelf this spring.",

                "reviewText": "The installation is easy, but if you have a small electric drill with hex bits, you can save a bunch of time and energy. Takes 10 minutes to put it together with the right tools.It's more substantial than the low price suggests, the box is quite heavy and the frame is sturdy. Comes with a wall anchor for stability.One of my frame parts were welded on the wrong side at the factory, so I reached out to the customer service email provided on an insert, not hoping much. However, they were super responsive and responded in one day, although there's a bit of lag in communication since they're based in China. Within 3 days of reaching out, the replacement part arrived from a regional warehouse so I didn't have to wait for anything to be shipped from China.Got it up and running and we couldn't be happier with the product itself.",

It comes with 11 shelves and you can configure them how ever you would like. We did ours to accomodate larger plants at the bottom sonwe have 2 left over shelves. But we loved how we had options and it doesnt affect the sturdiness of the product! Love it :)",

And it looks good.Compared to similar products, this bookshelf has metal beams staggered along the sides that make bookends less likely to be needed. That saved me money and headache! I still used a couple bookends, but only what I already had on hand for a couple under-filled shelves.If I had any complaint, it's that it looked shorter than I had hoped it would once installed. Fortunately, the artwork I put in the middle solved that problem. If you feel the same, you should try my solution. This is still a 5-star product, since it is the height I paid for.",
