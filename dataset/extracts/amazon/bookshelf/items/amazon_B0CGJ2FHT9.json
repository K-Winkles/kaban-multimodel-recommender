I don't need to anchor them to the wall because they go all the way to the ceiling/wall. These would definitely wobble if not secured in some way.They were easy to build and seem sturdy. I wouldn't load them with lots of heavy stuff on every shelf, but they can hold much more than what I have on them. They look nice and I like that they allow for airflow while still visually separating the space and giving me a place to display items.",

                "reviewText": "This bookshelf has a unique geometric, modern design. The bookshelf was easy to assemble following the instructions in the manual. I was able to build it myself in about an hour however once assembled the bookshelf is pretty tall and heavy so I did need a second person to help me with standing the bookshelf up and moving it. To note, I did have a little trouble getting the doors on the cabinet in the final steps as the pieces that retract to hold the door in place were not pushing down enough to secure them in pre-drilled holes. This was just a minor hiccup though, I was able to loosen the screws on the bottom of the cabinet, put the doors in place and then retighten the bottom shelf and problem solved. The bookshelf itself is a little narrow however for its height and depth it is more stable than I was expecting and so far seems to be pretty sturdy. The shelves on the unit have minor limitations with what they can hold as the pieces the divide the shelf cause each shelf to split into two parts with one being pretty small towards the end and can only fit smaller items on that part of each shelf. Also to note, the cabinet at the bottom of the shelf unit is a nice to have for hidden storage however it is pretty small and does not fit many things or larger items in it. For the most part though there is a decent amount of storage space with the number of shelves on the unit and cabinet. The bookshelf itself so far seems to be made of good quality materials and has a smooth finish that is easy to clean. I got this in espresso and the color was as I expected based on the product photos. My only issue with the color is that the inner part of the cutout lines in the cabinet doors are a lighter shade than the rest of the unit which makes them noticeably stand out and looks a little odd to me. Overall this is a tall, narrow bookshelf with a decent amount of storage space between the shelves and cabinet, it was easy to build, and has a unique, modern design that looks nice and so far is sturdy.",

                "reviewText": "We needed an actual bookshelf for our kids room. I saw this and thought it might be perfect. It is white and matches their room perfectly. The shelf was okay to build, the knobs provided were stripped so we had to use our own. The problems started after it was assembled. Our house is old and has uneven wooden floors. There are no leveling feet on this thing and it is extremely top heavy. it fell over before we had a chance to mount it to the wall and because it is made of cheap particle board it completely broke in one section so we had to rebuild it shorter. I see in the listing there are feet pads, we didnt get those. Glad it's finally anchored to the wall, but not putting much weight on these weak boards.",
