I used my own superglue in order to glue the wood pieces down or the little stubborn paper pieces, but I also use the glue that was provided. It came with a little piece of sandpaper to file down the sharp edges of the wood, but it was very easy and very fun. I will definitely be purchasing many more!!! This a is MUST MUST BUY!",

The instructions were simple to follow and everything fit together well with minimal glue used. I love that it comes with glue as well!! I absolutely love the details in this. It looks amazing on my bookshelf and I had the perfect little bear figure for it. I have bought so many book books after this one, but this has been the best out of all of them. It\u2019s so precious, I want to crawl in there so bad. Seriously one of my new favorite hobbies.",
