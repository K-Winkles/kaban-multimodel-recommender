                "reviewText": "I ordered one of these for my hallway. I chose this one because the price was decent, the width (how far out from the wall it goes) was ideal, and they offered it in white.Turned out to be SUPER easy to put together. From unboxing to securing to the wall, less than one hour total (I did use an electric drill which helped speed things along).I ended up liking the first one so much I purchased a second one immediately and now they are side by side.They work great as shoe racks, but I'll be adding more than just shoes (as I'm not a shoe collector so don't have too many pair).If you're going to build one of these, my wee bits of advice are:1) Do pay attention to the fact that the screws go INTO the larger hole and EXIT the smaller hole.2) It's easier if you screw the lone bracing sticks (you'll know what I mean when you get the box) into one of the side panels BEFORE securing the second side panel. I didn't notice that step in the instructions, so I put both sides of the stand together with the shelves first... and had to add the bracing sticks afterward, but it really wasn't a big deal.3) I did have one split (see photos) so I just removed the screws from that shelf and turned it around so the split is in the rear of the stand. For $70 I don't expect perfection. The fact that all the holes are in the right place and all the parts were included is pretty much all I require.4) They do provide an extra of most of the metal parts, just in case. That's nice.5) I do believe this could be top-heavy and possibly dangerous so this is the first piece of furniture I've ever attached to a wall (the supplies for that are included). They're both quite sturdy now with no risk of falling.6) Although an allen wrench is included, I used my drill to put this together. Just saved so much time and didn't risk tennis elbow. You'll need a drill bit that has one of those star-shaped or hexagonal heads... luckily my kit had one. Yay!7) You can (within reason) choose the spacing on the shelves. I decided to make both of my stands the same with a taller opening at the bottom for my work boots.The only complaints I would have, and they're not big enough complaints to remove a star from my rating are:1) Weirdly the company doesn't include enough white sticker dots to cover all the screw holes. That seems weird. They include a small page of the stickers... why not include enough for both sides of the stand?2) The smell. But I'm used to this icky off-gassing smell from inexpensive furniture and hope it dissipates over time like the other ones. Again, you get what you pay for and I'm 100% satisfied with my purchase.",
