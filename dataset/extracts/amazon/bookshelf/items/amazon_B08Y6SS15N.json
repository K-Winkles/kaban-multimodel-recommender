                "reviewText": "I really like this bookcase for my living room. I had purchased other bookcases which were single units and decided this one would go with them. I like the way the bookcase looks and the metal legs are quite sturdy. I also like the color. It's not real woodgrain but still looks pleasant. I have my cookie jar collection on this unit and they look very nice there.",

It's very basic but it looks really cool, I actually got this instead of a dresser and it looks awesome in my room.",

                "reviewText": "This bookshelf is gorgeous, especially for the price, it was around 150ish when I bought it. This is the second 3-tier bookshelf I bought off amazon, the first one was a disaster (pic was innaccurate, wrong size, bent metal, ugly screws sticking out in front etc.). This bookshelf however has me so happy!Things I really like about this bookshelf: The wood is sturdy and thin with wood texture and beautiful finish. The back boards are really thin and can be left off or moved where ever I want. Narrow bookshelf but very sturdy fits nice behind my desk with plenty of space. Top bars of bookshelf one solid piece that's smooth and modern. screws holding boards fit seamlessly against metal.Dislikes: the screws holding the main support slightly stick out.This is the second bookshelf I bought from vasagle and seriously falling in love with this brand/store/company. (also I want to mention I didn't get any type of incentive for this review, like those shady 'amazon gift card' for review etc. this is just a good solid bookshelf)",
