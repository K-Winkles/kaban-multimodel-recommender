                "reviewText": "This bookshelf was exactly what I expected. It\u2019s your standard particleboard shelf like the kind you would get at IKEA or Walmart. There were no big issues. Everything went together, really smoothly and easily. The thing fits perfectly in the corner of my closet which is an odd skinny space. It gave me a lot more room in the closet. I can store two pairs of shoes in each shelf if I want one pair to basically be resting on the other. Otherwise only one pair goes in at a time and the very tip of the toebox hangs out a little bit. Can also store things like sweaters And some purses but again, the shelf is not very deep and some things hang out a little in the front. Regardless, I\u2019m happy with my purchase, and it gave me a lot of functional space where before there was none.",

We used very small amount elmer's school kid glue rubbed on with qtips, inside the dowel holes before attaching. Ended up with a completely sturdy bookcase. Loved it enough that we ordered a second bookcase. (After finding another narrow spot up a wall for books between other furniture. )",

Not in love with it, but it works in the space where I need it. The stickers look stupid and don\u2019t match the paint, but it was that or the bare screws. There is some gapping. The shelves only have preset placements so unlike many bookshelves, you are very limited in what you can do. There are several inch gaps between main anchor shelves and where the additional adjustable ones can go. If you have a few more inches, I\u2019d just get the smaller Billy bookcase. I didn\u2019t quite have enough room for the smaller one next to my big one. I wish I did, but I\u2019m about 3 inches short on room. Not worth the hassle of returning when this will work how I need it to for now. Could be so much better though & kind of a letdown.",
