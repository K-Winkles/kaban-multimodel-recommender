It wobbles a bit but is not a big deal in our case, and after putting it together, it felt nice and sturdy. Thankfully, the item I received did not have any rust on it as some of the other reviewers unfortunately experienced. I forgot to count the number of books it is currently holding but it\u2019s probably around 40, from baby sized board books to more advanced picture books. A major upgrade from the tiny bookcase we had been using in its place, which was way too small for what we needed.",

The bookshelf has three slots at the top for storing books of different sizes and two shelves at the bottom for toys and other items. The bookshelf is also portable and can be moved around easily.The bookshelf has a simple and minimalist design that fits well with any decor. However, it is not very attractive or stylish. The white color is plain and the metal material looks cheap. The bookshelf also does not have any safety features such as anti-tip brackets or rounded edges. It might not be suitable for very young children or those who like to climb on furniture.Overall, this bookshelf is a functional and durable option for children who need more storage space in their room. It is not very appealing or innovative, but it serves its purpose well. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a basic and affordable bookshelf for children",
