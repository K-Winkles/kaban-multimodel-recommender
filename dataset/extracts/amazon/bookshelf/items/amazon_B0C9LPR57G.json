I wanted something that looked classy for my office and this shelf fits the bill. Quality is pretty good - similar to other value-based furniture that you might buy in a big box store. But the style really sets this one apart from others on the market. Assembly wasn't too bad if you are handy and patient.Overall this is a good mid-quality shelf unit with excellent styling and I would recommend it to others.",

                "reviewText": "First of all, I want to state that once assembled, this small shelf unit seems pretty sturdy. I will likely be putting books on it and I think it will manage its capacity quite well.As far as ease of assembly is concerned: I had to read the instructions a couple of times before I could figure out which hardware was which. The instructions are inconsistently labelled. On page one, the hardware is not labelled with a corresponding alphabet letter to match it with the packets of nuts, bolts, etc.. On other pages, the pieces are labelled to correspond to the alphabet packets. On the positive side, there is a packet of extra pieces. I didn't need them, but sometimes when putting pieces of furniture together one does come across a defective piece. I had to buy extra pieces for a recent project, but not this one.I would recommend not following the directions as stated. Instead of attaching the top completely and then the bottom, I attached one side of each shelf then lined up the other side. I find doing it this way prevents the headache of having to realign and loosen previously attached pieces. Also, do not tighten any screws/bolts until the assembly of any one step is complete. again, this is so alignment can be made without too much headache. One of the pieces of the side bars, was out of line but not enough so that it jeopardized the integrity of the piece, but it did not fit together perfectly.All in all, a pretty sturdy shelf. Its small. I rated it 4 stars only because I had to decipher the assembly instructions more than I felt I should have.",
