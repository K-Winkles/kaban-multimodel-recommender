(Everyone will have different opinion of easy or hard based on your strength-you need muscle) I like it though.It does hold ALLOT of books but with the bigger books it's hard to turn without them falling off so you have to go very slow and it's ok. Recommended more for smaller books if you're going to be turning it allot. but larger books do fit. Attached photo.As far as material is made of. Hard to explain but it should be cheaper. It's hard but not wood. It's sturdy for what it's made of but should be a stronger wood for the price in my opinion. We've only had it a couple months so hard to say how long it will last.I like that it takes up less space than our wooden bookcase.I added photos of the larger books and how they fit in the shelves showing overhang.",

After getting each later mostly set, I layed a towel over the top and tapped with a mallet to set them better.Be sure that you put it together correctly the first time so you don't have to take them apart!!! Some of the laminate peeled back in the slots when I had to adjust a couple shelves beause I messed up.Aside from some cosmetic blemishes, it looks good and our daughter absolutely loves it. I like the doily it came with. Wasn't sure if that's designed for a floor mat or a dust cover on top, and didn't care to look it up, so I use it as a dust cover.My only real concern is stability, which could be said about any tower. Put heavy stuff on the bottom and pay attention to weight distribution.",

Assembly could have been easier with better instructions, but overall it only took me about 30 minutes so I can't complain too much. Several of the pieces came scratched or dented, which is understandable based on how cheap the material is. It's not that big a deal to me because it's going in my playroom where my kids will destroy it anyway, but don't buy this if you expected to show it off.Overall my biggest issue is that I paid way more than this thing is worth. It's getting the job done, but you may want to just save your money.",
