                "reviewText": "I was thinking the shelf would come pre-built, but I was incorrect. I am a great handyman, so I wasn't too worried. The instructions say that you need two people to build this, but I did it all by my lonesome just fine.The instructions kind of confused me at first until I started putting stuff together and then they were very understandable. It says to read all the instructions first before building, which I, of course, did not do. So, please do that and you will likely not have any confusion like I did.It took me very little time to put this shelf together and it looks very nice. It looks expensive and it is great quality for being such a low price. It is very sturdy, too. I didn't like that the particle board back was not shown to need to have nails put in there to stay put with the shelf backs because it looked flubby with the three slats just being set together and only secured with the nails around the outer edges. So, I just marked the particle board back with a sharpie pen where the shelf was and then stuck some flat pins in there to secure it in the back better and it looks great.The instructions say to use a rubber mallet, which I did not have, so I used a hammer. The small nails are easily bent with a hammer, hence the instructions saying to use a rubber mallet. If you use a hammer, just be very gentle with hitting those little nails in. I bent a couple into disrepair or else I would have used those to secure my particle board to the back of the shelves and not flat tacks. There are also no extra screws, so be aware that you can't lose any. This shelf is awesome, please buy!!",

                "reviewText": "It looks good! the assembly instructions were straight forward. it does not come with a hammer or screwdriver, but thankfully i have both. the reason i said it\u2019s what i expected for the price is because one side is slightly uneven. i put the screws in where the small holes were in the wood for you to do so, so it\u2019s the holes that are slightly uneven. it just makes one side panel stick out about a half centimeter further than the other side. i don\u2019t think anyone will really notice if they don\u2019t look closely at it. technically i could remove the side panel and re-screw it in just not using the original holes as guides, but i am too lazy for that honestly lol. i may go in with some extra nails of my own to further secure the center back panel, as it is wobbly, but that won\u2019t hurt anything if i decide not to either. overall it looks good, not perfect but good. i\u2019m content with it for what i paidEdit: I wanted to add that they put styrofoam in the box to keep the wood from getting damaged. when i opened the box and as I assembled, the styrofoam got EVERYWHERE. made a huge mess and now there are styrofoam pieces everywhere and sticking to everything. hard to get off.pretty sure i will be finding pieces of that for months",

I just spaced out the other good nails a little bit more. There were no extra pieces in either packages.It really is a decent shelf once it's built. The pictures I took were to show the minor things to be aware of. Obviously it's not real wood, so there was just a little bit of cracking at the screw entry at times. It was also really difficult to get the back pieces flush with the shelves. The first one I put together definitely ended up not straight but it's the back so it doesn't matter. The second one wasn't so bad.All in all, if you are buying shelves on a budget, this isn't a bad option.",

                "reviewText": "My wife and I thought this would be a good shelf for in our bathroom to replace and old decrepit wicker one. I have assembled this type of product before, and this took about the usual time as others to complete. One thing we immediately noticed, as other reviewers have mentioned, was when you try to remove the labels on the side walls, it pulls the faux wood like paper covering off. We simply left the second label on it.The shelf looked nice in our bathroom but within hours we both began noticing a very disagreeable smell. Thinking this would dissipate within a day or two, we put up with it. After two days, neither of us could stand it any longer and talked about sitting it in our garage for a week or so to see if the outgassing would stop. After 10 days in the garage, we brought it back into the house only to remove it once again within a few hours. The smell was not confined to the bathroom either. I have a home office across the hallway and a bit diagonal to the bathroom door and I generally have my door closed. The smell permeated thru the heat vents or just general air flow, and it was almost as bad in my office as it was being in the bathroom which is about 15-20 feet away.We have now taken the shelf back out to the garage and are going to try to use it in our basement unless it outgasses from there too much and permeates the entire house. If we cannot use it in the basement, we will try to rearrange our garage and use it there. I read that it was returnable within 30 days but that is not an option considering you would have to disassemble it with all the screws and pull all the nails from the back boards which makes returning simply not an option.As I mentioned earlier, I have assembled this type of shelf unit, much larger in size, multiple times and have never experienced the strong odor this unit gives off. I really wish I could have rated this better as the shelf did look nice in our bathroom, but it is simply not something I would recommend anyone else purchasing.",
