I got it for my daughter's room... with five shelves plus the top it is a wonderful storage solution not only for her books but for her toys too. The assembly was easy for the most part however the back of the bookshelf is made up of three panels that are attached using plastic strips... when trying to put these panels in place it is somewhat difficult because one of them keeps trying to pop out when placing another one in. Once together it is truly amazing and well worth the effort. I also like how it can be mounted to the wall to keep it from tipping over.I am very pleased with this bookshelf... it really pulls my daughter's room together and creates so much extra space for her. It's a good value for the money and I recommend it!",

The assembly was nice and easy because all the parts were labeled, however it did take about 2 hours. I love that 2 of the shelves can be adjusted to fit different sizes of things. I have put this bookshelf in my small home office. I have put books, picture frames, and baskets to organize things on this bookshelf. I love it!",

The color matches my other bookcases really well, which I'm happy with. It feels sturdy and well balanced, and the shelves went in smoothly - it's always a great thing when nothing has to be forced to fit. Now I can transfer some of my book piles into this and get my library slightly more organized.",

Purchased this to go into the kids room and hold their books, my mistake for not measuring accurately for it to fit in said space. my bad! But the assembly itself took over two hours, closer to three, for what should have been a simple bookcase. its flimsy and made of pressboard so the back is easy to break and the sides will crumble if not moved delicately. I am just not impressed with the overall quality of this piece.",
