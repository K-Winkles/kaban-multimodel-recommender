It looks great and once the tie strap is connected to the wall behind it, it's very stable for a small width shelf this tall. I'm thinking about a second one now right beside this one in my space, as the six shelves didn't last as long as I thought they would., the are all full now and I still have need for more. So, I'm going to get another when I can and put it right beside this one. So, that's a good review from me. Unless you splurge for solid wood instead of particle board type shelves, this one is very nice for 2024 sorta cheap. Just wish it had a twin next to it... :-) Soon...",

The finish almost looks like real wood! The bars are very sturdy, maybe iron.It\u2019s a perfect shelving unit for my extra kitchen gadgets.I have to warn people though that it is both very easy and very hard to assemble. It takes time just because there\u2019s about 70 screws to make tighten. Another problem is that too I have to pay careful attention to the numbers and letters in the assembly manual otherwise it is very easy to mid up the longer screws with the shorter screws, in which case you might have to start all over :D Also the bars really need to be facing the right direction or you won\u2019t be able to add the supports to make the unit even more sturdy. I found that the attachments for wall attachment was unnecessary for us since it was very sturdy and not wobbly and highly unlikely to fall.",

I especially like how the shelves have raised panels on the sides and back to help prevent bottles from sliding off where they should not go.Also another feature that made this work well is that the shelves are each slightly adjustable in height. This allowed me to add a few inches on a couple of the shelves to accommodate some of the unusually taller bottles.All in all I am very pleased with this. It works well, looks great, and holds everything very nicely!",

                "reviewTitle": "5.0 out of 5 stars Nice bookshelf if it holds up to the weight",
                "reviewText": "I needed a bookshelf for my collection of college and high-school textbooks (not mine; I'm not a graduate but I'm using them for studies now). These are big, tall, heavy books so I needed something that would hold but I didn't want something too heavy or large. This was perfect. The adjustment range on the individual shelves left a capacity for book height from about 11 inches for most of the shortest and 13.5 inches at the tallest.When you adjust most of the shelves to the 12- or 13.5-inch height, that left one shelf with a 10 inch height, which is fine for one shelf to take the shorter books. I would have loved this even more if it could be adjusted for 13-inch height to accommodate the tallest textbooks. This, literally, would have only taken about 2 more inches of height overall.The description claims metal and wood construction but the only wood in this is the sawdust from real woodwork pressed into particle board - though the quality of the paper wrap over the particle board is great and it actually looks like a high-quality furniture-grade, 11-layer, plywood... But don't be fooled; it's not.Because the shelves are particle board, it becomes important that the only thing holding them in are these very course-threaded furniture screws; you've probably seen and installed them by the dozens before. And you'll install them by the dozens in this unit as well. In assembling the sides and back to the shelves. These screws go through the metal frame before going into the shelves to mount the shelf, meaning that just over an inch of screw goes into the particle board to hold the 75 pounds that each shelf is supposed to carry.It is these screws into particle board, shortened effectively by the thickness of the frame, that lead to the 4-star review because I just don't think it's going to hold up. To earn 5 stars, I should not only like the shelves but should also be confident that it's going to last. I don't have that confidence. And by the time I've owned it long enough to know it is going to hold up, the product will be off the market and reviews, good or otherwise, won't matter.So, consider the positives and the limitations and you can make your own choice. For me, I'm glad I bought this. So far, it's definitely better to have my piles of textbooks on these shelves instead of stacked on the floor.",
