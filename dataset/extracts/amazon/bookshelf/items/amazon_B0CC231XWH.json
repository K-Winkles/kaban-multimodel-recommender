                "reviewText": "Have gotten a lot of put-it-together shelving units over the years, and this one is one of the better ones.Easy to put together, with very clear instructions (even though it was a \"Wordless Workshop\" type of instruction book with pictures only, no descriptive words to say HOW to do it), and good engineering for stability and sturdiness.Details that I like:< Good organization of hardware and furniture pieces, with each item clearly spelled out in the instructions. Made assembly very easy (took less than two hours as a one-man project).< Combination of steel frame and painted plywood/particleboard shelves, doors and cabinet sides.< Backing board for back of cabinet slid in easily into grooves - not just tacked onto the back like a lot of these type pieces of furniture.< I especially like the placement of the shelves with a crossbar welded between each shelf to help keep books from sliding off the shelf!< Adjustable leg/feet to adjust for any floor evenness issues.< The doors to the cabinet part are on hinges that are spring loaded! Made it EXTREMELY easy to attach the doors!< Shelves and other wood parts have a distinct wood-grain look, even though painted black.< Most hardware had extras (none was missing).< There was several points where, as I was assembling it, I found the hardware connection redundant to double up the strength. This impressed me!Details that I didn't like:< There was a part that I could not figure out what it was for or where to put it (part #15, I believe). So I just stored these parts with the spare parts.When all done, I was easily able to carry it by myself to its designated spot. Very tall, nice depth, but very, very sturdy! Definitely recommend!",
