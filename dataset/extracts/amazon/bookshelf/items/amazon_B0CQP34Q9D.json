                "reviewText": "First of all it did not have directions. I should have stopped putting it together after a few of the holes were not lining up correctly. Not very sturdy, none of the holes lined up, had to drill holes to assemble it, some of the shelves had holes but they were so close to the edge that they blew the sides out of the shelf, we had to go buy hardware cause it did not have enough. I give lightweight 3 stars cause it is very light. The shelves are not 13\" apart they are about 10-11\" at most, they also do not hold more than 15 lbs. I called to see if Amazon would compensate me for at least the hardware and they will not. DO NOT BUY!!!!!",

Looks like any other \"expensive\" shelving unit I've bought. Everything was labeled properly, even the hardware was numbered in their own section bags. Would definitely buy again from this seller. Only flaw was one of the screws were stripped and the seller didn't put an extra one in of that screw. I'm using mine for the rest of my shoes and purses since I have so many.Update: bought another one lol, this one I'm going to use to organize all my wallets and clutches.",
