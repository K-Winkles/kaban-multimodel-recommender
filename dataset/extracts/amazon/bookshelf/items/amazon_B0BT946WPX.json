                "reviewText": "This bookshelf was super easy to put together by myself and didn\u2019t take too long at all. The only negative is that it was missing the small plates and screws that go on the doors and keep them closed with the magnetic piece. Easily replaceable by a trip to Lowe\u2019s soon. I\u2019m thinking about getting a second one for another room.**If you crochet or knit, it\u2019s great for yarn, which is what I\u2019m using this one for. Skeins of blanket yarn fit perfectly and you can get 8 skeins per shelf! The cabinets are the bonus to keep the cats away from it all lol",

I was puzzled about all the people who gave this product 3 stars because it was small. It is a small bookcase but the dimensions given are accurate so the small size should not have been a surprise. It was a perfect fit for my bathroom. I would have given it 5 stars but some of the directions could have been better. It was not difficult to assemble but the directions were occasionally a little murky.",

The bookcase is sturdy. I do like how the bookcase color fit with the rest of my furniture. All the parts fit as they should. The only problem I had was how the hardware was labeled. I believe the bookcase was worth the prices I paid for, compared to a Walmart bookcase. Update, need another bookcase,too many books. I will buy another bookcase to match this one.",

These aren't super tall and bulky like most bookshelves, so I thought they might be a good fit for our space. I ordered two of them and was able to fit all of our books (we have a very big collection!) and we store our board games inside the cabinets too! I was pleasantly surprised with how much you can store in these bookshelves. Putting them together was a little tedious, I did it myself and the first one took about an hour and a half and the second one took half the time because by then I knew what I was doing lol But all in all I'm very happy with these.",

They told me they would send replacement hardware weeks ago, and then last week they said it would ship in 4 or 5 days. So far, nothing. How hard can it be to grab a package of the hardware and ship it? I'd ship the rest of the pieces back, but based on their assurances I discarded the mangled box. Amazon should think seriously about dropping IRONCK as a vendor. In another day or so I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau about this company's terrible customer service. In the meantime, I am stuck with over $100 worth of now worthless wood pieces and I am out that $100+.",
