                "reviewText": "Product arrived later than originally promised and contained sturdier wood than I expected. Unfortunately I was missing a critical set of hardware so I contacted the seller asking to be sent the missing item and it took several days to get a response and when they did respond they I was told to go to a local hardware store to purchase it and they would reimburse me. 3 days and 5 hardware stores later I was unable to find the correct size and had to order the missing hardware from Amazon and wait for it to be delivered. Overall I'm happy with the product and the ease of building it but I'm extremely disappointed in the service I received and will never buy from this seller again.",

                "reviewText": "I love the color and size of this cabinet, and the added doors on the bottom are a plus to keep pets or small children away from pulling things off the shelf. The added stabilizer is a bonus as well, and keeps it from tipping over which is great as I live in a very old home that has started to settle in places.The only issue I had was installing the corner brackets that help stabilize the shelvings. It seemed that the little tab wouldn't sink all the way into the pockets it was supposed to go into and thus the short screws didn't appropriately grab without a bit of force. Otherwise it was easily assembled and even without the brackets in some places works just fine!",

Very easy to assemble - directions we\u2019re pretty straightforward and the quality of the materials are pretty good.Only complaint is that there were not plugs included to cover the hardware spots on the sides.Included a few pictures so you can see the cabinets on their own and what we did with them.Great for a smaller space as they are very low profile.",
