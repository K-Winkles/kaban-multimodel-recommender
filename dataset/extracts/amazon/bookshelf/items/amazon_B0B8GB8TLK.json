However, we gave it to my granddaughter and she loves it to store her schoolbooks on her desk. It goes together and comes apart easily, is very sturdy and looks good; all for a reasonable price.",

                "reviewText": "I love this little shelf! As someone who lives in an actual tiny house, finding storage for my ever-growing collection of books, Manga, and graphic novels is always a challenge.Until I stumbled on this cute little shelf.The whole thing arrives in four pieces - the bottom and back panel, and the two leg pieces.Assembly was pretty difficult, as the pieces were not sanded beforehand, and I had to use a hammer to put a couple pieces together all the way, but that didn't dent or scratch anything.Overall, assembly was a little tough, but easy, and this little shelf is VERY sturdy. It doesn't wobble or bent at all, and holds plenty of books, obviously depending on how large your titles are.10/10 would recommend for tiny or small spaces",

I put it under my desk so to keep my surface area cleared off and I can easily access my binders from below. Reasonably priced too.",
