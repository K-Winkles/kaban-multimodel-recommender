I was able to figure everything out, but pieces don't fit together. The cross supports bow out, the pre-drilled holes don't line up right, the metal shelf supports are all bend, the legs are slightly bent, the bolts to attach the top cross support are not long enough, and the hooks are too wide for the tubes resulting in them dangling.I would never buy this for myself outright.

I think my favorite part of this small bookshelf is the fact that the shelves themselves are deep enough for nice size, books, or larger, bulky items, and it\u2019s modern look add a nice touch to any decor. Overall, I love the small bookshelf and have no complaints.",

It was actually kind of fun!I won't be using this for any really heavy-duty storage, so it will meet my particular needs for a pantry shelf just fine. My experience with these kinds of things has been that too much weight on the shelves will cause buckling/sagging. But for chips and cannisters of dry goods like coffee or cereal this is fine.",
