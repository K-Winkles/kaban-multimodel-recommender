                "reviewText": "I gave this a 5 star overall, but a 3 star for the directions. We had a few \"oops\" moments where we realized that the posts were facing the wrong way. Otherwise, this bookshelf is perfect. It is sturdy, all of the pieces went together and it looks absolutely beautiful. The box arrived in a little bit of \"rough\" condition, but that's not a surprise during the holidays. The pieces were so well packed inside, that there wasn't a dent or scratch on anything. I would buy this again.",

                "reviewText": "I bought this bookcase after doing some research across various options, decided to share my thoughts below.Positives:Very sturdy - pretty sure barring you putting your full weight on this once fully assembled, it won't topple over under normal circumstances.Great L Shape with a ton of shelf options including corner shelves between the normal shelf levels (very unique and really useful).Each part was clearly labeled for assembly purposes for the instructions.Negatives (and these aren't very bad):The wood pictured on the product sales page is not the color you get; it is far darker brown (some of the pictures in the reviews actually show it much better for what you will get). They probably used a high contrast set of images for the product page, just be aware this isn't a light or medium brown set of shelves with blackened rings, it is dark brown with blackened rings. Honestly this was the only reason I took off 1 star, would have preferred the color in the product's images as shown, but it's not a major issue for my area either.The packaging styrofoam does keep the items pretty well protected in shipping. After saying that part and maybe I'm unlucky here, it kind of exploded into little bits and attached itself to nearly every shelf and metal bar. It's a ton of cleanup while removing it from the box and assembling the bookcase.The shelves aren't 100% perfectly drilled or aligned when assembling the bookcase. 3 of the 5 shelves when they meet at the L joint have small gaps or are slightly angled (can even see the dowels in one case with the gap). This probably was a manufacturing issue or machining problem with the holes that were drilled in the assembly - it's wood so this stuff happens. The gaps are quite small, and I doubt much would be able to fall through accidentally but it's still worth noting.The instructions for the assembly while pretty easy to follow aren't great for the shelf assembly when you insert them so that the dowel holes face each other - be mindful of that when you're doing those steps because the other holes are basically symmetrical for the connections to the metal frame and you might not notice it at first (you don't want to screw them in the wrong order and undo it to correct later). Entirely reliant on allen wrench assembly (can be good and bad, some of the screws could easily have been made for a phillips-head screwdriver instead but just weren't). Also, when tightening some of the screws on the bottom of the shelves, the plastic inserts don't always tighten properly and just spin in their holes at a certain point, not from over-tightening but just not fully secured in the wood to prevent that from happening (again it's probably a machining issue during manufacturing).Overall:Very satisfied so far with the bookcase and it looks nice while being quite stable (not concerned about leveling issues or it falling over). If you're looking for an open back L shaped bookcase this is a pretty good one and the price is very reasonable even with the small shipping fee.Hope this helps folks looking for something that fits their bookcase search.",
