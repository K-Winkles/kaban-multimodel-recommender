                "reviewText": "The VORPEXA Small Bookshelf, a 3-tier gold bookcase, stands as a good addition to the home, particularly for those residing in smaller living spaces where maximizing every inch is crucial. This easy-to-assemble shelf provides both functionality and aesthetic appeal.In my experience, this bookshelf has proven to be a versatile storage solution. Specifically, we've repurposed it as a convenient shelving system for organizing vitamins and supplements. Its quick accessibility has made it a practical and efficient go-to for our daily routine, especially, busy mornings when time is short.Beyond its utility in small living spaces, the VORPEXA Small Bookshelf could also find a perfect spot in a home office setup. The straightforward assembly process further adds to its appeal. It took only about 10 minutes to put together, and I managed to assemble it while casually watching a TV show.",

                "reviewText": "I built these shelves by myself last night. It wasn't hard at all. Just be sure you remember to match the holes on both sides. I did not. My stupid. But the screw wasn't vital, so the shelves are standing in my kitchen waiting for a bag of chips.But I'll say that they're kind of pretty for shelves. I feel bad adding them to the kitchen. I need a bigger pantry, but well... I really do like the look of the shelves and the construction is strong. I promise to move them to a prettier place when my kitchen is remodeled. Whenever that happens.For now, the shelves are the best! I may go and buy another. Seriously. I'm going to look for its bigger sibling, if indeed there IS a bigger sib. Should be. This three-shelves edition is a success!",

I ordered it and it was here within 3 days without any damage to the packaging or product itself. I took it all out of the box and it maybe took me 15 minutes to have it together and full of stuff in the basement. This is a nice looking shelve and would look great in any room. The instructions were easy enough and really it could of been winged if you have engineering sense. I do recommend this product, I couldn't be happier!!",
