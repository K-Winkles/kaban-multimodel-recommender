Now we didn't anchor them into the wall, which I'm sure would help, and they do provide tools for that in the packaging. But, if you were thinking you might be able to avoid putting holes in your walls, I might think twice. The bottom support legs are pretty small and don't provide a great surface on the carpet, but I think they'd be fine on hard floors. Overall, though, pretty good pieces.",

While the upper walls of the interior of my house have built-in shelves instead of cabinets, there were areas that were impractical for built-in shelves due to the electrical wiring running inside the walls. I opted for these bookshelves and am very satisfied. They are attractive, sturdy, and fit in odd areas where built-in shelves aren't practical. I ended up purchasing 4 units - two this size and two narrower units. I definitely recommend these units and a large unit for hanging clothing with open-work side storage.",

Even then the metal halves weren't straight but rather quite scewed. Once you screw the shelves in place it bends it mostly straight as the metal is fairly malliable. Overall I like the look and felt assembly was reasonably easy but the quality of manufacturing certainly leaves something to be desired. Pro tip pay attention to where the screw holes are on the back where the cross sections mount. This will avoid having to disassemble / reassemble to swap bar placements. It's what I was looking for so I'm satisfied but having to repair something you bought was frustrating.",
