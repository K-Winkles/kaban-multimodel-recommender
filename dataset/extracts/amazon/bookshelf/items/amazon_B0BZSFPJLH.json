The screws are for a philip head screwdriver with a very thin head. There is a tool included,however I found it difficult to use. I ended up using a locking plier to manipulate the tiny tool for the screws. It tool me about 2 hours to put together (the instructions stated 30 minutes) and I am very pleased with this product.",

                "reviewText": "This shelf was super cute and directions are easy to follow. Two minor things that were annoying while setting it up were1. No extra screws.. this would not usually be a problem except for the fact that while I was screwing together some pieces one of the screw heads went right through the hole and I could not get it out so I had to cut the screw. So now I have one shelf missing a screw.2. The handles for the little baskets were an absolute nightmare. Unless you have fingers the size of tweezers you probably are gonna hate this part or not do it at all.Other than those two annoying little things that happened I\u2019m happy with how it looks and how sturdy it is. A great addition for a great price.",

(I didn\u2019t READ the description so this is my fault) The baskets are okay for my current needs so I still give this 5 stars \ud83c\udf1f. I won\u2019t complain too much due to the cost.",
