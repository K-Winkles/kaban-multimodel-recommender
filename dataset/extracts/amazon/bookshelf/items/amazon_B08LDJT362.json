Though I had bought a bookshelf for manga I put off getting another one for the rest of the books and the piles were gradually growing by the month.So I bought this one.Pros:- Assembly isn't too difficult. Any difficulty I had was mostly because I decided to put it together alone.- Perfect size for a manga shelf.- Looks Great.Cons:- Quite a few of the books that I wanted to put on this shelf wouldn't fit because they were just a little too big. Even though the shelves are adjustable I feel making room for the books that wouldn't fit with take away space from other books and I wouldn't be able to have it sorted as I would have liked.- It was shorter than I thought it would be with five tiers.Luckily since the spacing is perfect for my manga collection I decided to transfer the manga from my other shelf and used the other shelf for the books I've had piled up. So even though the outcome wasn't as I had wanted it still worked out.These shelves are good as long as the books you want to put on here are not bigger than roughly 9 inches. Since the books I get from Book of the Month are just slightly bigger they didn't quite fit. [This is if the shelves are evenly spaced.]I will probably buy another since my manga collection already filled this shelving unit and will continue to grow. Just probably won't be used for non-manga as most of my books came from Book of the Month.",

                "reviewText": "I needed a Shelving Unit to fit a specific space. I found this same model available from big box retailers in the 6 foot version for half the price. But, I needed the shorter 52.7\" version which proved difficult to find anywhere but here. The packaging was good, nothing was damaged. The instructions were very clear and easy to follow. It came with a screwdriver and allen key. The only thing not provided was a hammer for the feet. The hardware was a little below average and it was a good thing they gave some extras of each piece as some were unusable. Like a missing phillips head, it was just smooth. And a cracked apart cam. Since this unit is black I was puzzled by the white cover for the wall attachment and the light brown plastic feet. The particle board pieces were nicely made and labeled. The holes were a little off , but worked without a noticeable misalignment. It was only noticeable to Me, who tried to hold it square while tightening. Read the other reviews carefully. Some people do not know how to follow instructions and blame the product. One such review complains about the back panel having tape on the front that looks horrible. In actuality they put the rear panel in backwards as seen in their photo. When assembled it is sturdy for what it is. I would recommend the bracket that holds it to the wall, it is skinny and with some weight on it could fall forward. And remember this is a really inexpensive shelving unit. I don't think it should be called a Bookshelf as books are heavy and I don't think you could put a row of books on each shelf. I am using this to hold 3D Printer Filament, so I am below the 11 pound per shelf limit. All in all, I am happy I could find it in exactly the size I needed.",

                "reviewText": "This bookshelf is so beautiful. It wasn't difficult to put together just a bit time-consuming and messy. Not much more so than any other furniture I've assembled, though. I like that this was one compact, as it fits perfectly in the space we need it to. Holds a LOT of stuff, and every shelf is adjustable except for the very middle one. We anchored this to our wall so our toddler can play with the bottom shelves and it won't fall over.The stickers are a little difficult to remove so we just kept a few in there. They're not noticeable. Stability at a four because the back is a flimsy sort of wood, so if we didn't anchor it I feel like it wouldn't have enough weight to keep it from falling over. We also have it on a carpet but a hardwood floor would keep it more stable.",

The instructions were mainly diagram based and if you look at each part shown on them diligently (and compare to each part you are about to use - especially the amount and location of screw holes) you can\u2019t go wrong !TIPS: (1) as they recommend, better two people build it/help out to prevent shelves and panels tipping over with only few screws in - esp. in beginning stages. (2) It comes with allen keys, but I suggest you hold a bigger flat point plus a smaller star screwdriver close by for assembly.Each of these items received thus far have EXCEEDED our expectations from the word go by far. We\u2019ve found no flaws, no missing items or parts at all, no flimsyness. They have been WELL designed and the materials are fabulous. The assembled products look fantastic too ! Innovative and modern as well. WAY, WAY better quality than I have seen at many local retailers ! ..... they are sturdy and the price of these are fantastic !I can\u2019t give anything but 5\u2b50\ufe0f for each of these !",
