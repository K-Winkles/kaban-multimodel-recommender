                "reviewText": "I needed some slim shelves to store purses on behind the clothing hanging in my closet. These were on sale at half price and fit my closet and budget perfectly. They are not super stable, but are moreso than I was given to believe when reading other reviews. If I was storing or displaying heavier items in a high traffic area, the included wall strap would certainly have been necessary.They look about like what you would expect for pressboard shelves. This isn\u2019t heirloom furniture, but they look decent and get the job done. They were packed well, so no scratches or dings. The label stickers also came off easily without marring the finish like others had trouble with. I do really like the espresso color. It\u2019s a nice dark black-brown. Also, some pressboard has a terrible chemical smell, but it wasn\u2019t really noticeable on these. So yay!Putting it together took about 45 minutes and was relatively easy, even without help. Instructions were clear and concise. Pictures were labeled and helpful. The hardest part was screwing in the baseboard to the bottom shelf. The holes were marked, but not pre-drilled so it took me a while to screw them in with a screwdriver. My hand strength is pretty bad though. I think it took me 20 minutes just to do that step while keeping the boards lined up. Everything else was easy peasy (despite my cat doing her best to \u201chelp\u201d). All boards, holes, and screws lined up perfectly. Honestly, the only time I felt I needed a second person was when I toted the finished shelves up the stairs.",

I ordered the 6 shelf for small appliances and cookbooks, and ended up using it as a kitchen bookcase/open pantry. 1. The packing foam dust clung onto everything. It was snowing packing foam particles and clinging onto everything. 2. There were minor scrapes and chips on several pieces. 3. Some of the pieces were not marked. On the upside, and the reason for the 5 star review, the value, the physical manageability, and the ease of assembly understandability and assembly. The directions say 30 minutes with two people, and I believe it. It took me an hour and a half with luxurious ease by myself. Totally doable in an hour by yourself if you feel confident, you\u2019ve got this!!! It is not a luxurious solid wood ancestral or legacy inheritable masterpiece. The mastery is the design of ease and value. I do think I\u2019m going to touch up a few spots. But for the price, a tenth of its solid wood counterparts, I highly recommend it. Super easy in every way. I bought two, I will try to record the process on the second.",

                "reviewText": "I ordered 2 of these to help furnish my living room in my new apartment (along with several other items by Furinno as well). When I went to assemble them many of the screw holes stripped out on them when I went to tighten the screws by hand (I ended up using some longer/larger screws that I had on hand, but unfortunately those weren't countersunk head screws so the shiny steel heads are clearly visible), additionally several of the panels were badly scratched or scuffed up on the faces and edges. Add to that the use of the cheapest possible cam lock fasteners they could probably get (a couple of which broke when tightening by hand (there's only 4 in each unit), fortunately I had some on hand from other furniture that I was able to use), they didn't come with any textured stickers to cover the screws that didn't strip out on me. The edge banding on the panels is horrendous looking like they used a slightly undersized banding which leaves a sliver of the particle board material visible along the edges (might be able to hide it using a black marker since I purchased the black bookcases). The back panel on one of them was damaged and lightly cracked as a result too. Had a little trouble with the screw holes for the hinge brackets too on one of them, the hole was just a little further from the edge than it should have been so that when I went to put the hinge pin bracket on it didn't quite line up centered on the hole in the bracket, I had to start the screw through the bracket without having the bracket all the way into position so that the screw would end up pulling the bracket tightly onto the corner of the door panel. It's also worth noting that the units don't come with any kind of 'feet' to protect your floor from scratches when moving them. All in all while I'm quite pleased with the other Furinno products I've purchased (a Jaya TV stand, and 2 Jaya end tables), these are garbage in my opinion. If it weren't for the fact that the other brand of bookcase I had been looking at sold out by the time I was ready to submit my order I probably wouldn't have had to deal with the problems I had with these. Do yourself a favor and look for a different set instead of buying these. Not worth the problems even if they are inexpensive.",
