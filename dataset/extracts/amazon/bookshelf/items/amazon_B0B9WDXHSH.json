I love the corner design as it saves a lot of space but also holds a lot of books and other things. The quality of the boards is better than I expected as well. It was a little wobbly after I put it together but that got better once it was secured to the wall.",

                "reviewText": "I was hesitant this shelf would look cheap when we took it out of the box but it turned out perfect! I love the open shelves (allows us to still access the outlets) and it mounts to the wall therefore my toddles cannot pull it down into them. There is some \u201cwasted\u201d space in the center where the two shelves connect due to the overlap of the boards but I think it allows some white space and not look too crowded. We got several complements on it the first weekend it was up. Also it was not hard and didn\u2019t take too long to assemble.",

                "reviewText": "I was looking for a corner bookcase to fit in a small area, and also be functional for book storage. This one is a perfect fit! The bookcase itself is very sturdy once anchored into the wall. It has plenty of room. For a standard hardcover book. My only qualm is that one shelf had a slight defect on the under side where it screws into the frame. I was unable to completely secure it because of this defect. When I messaged Amazon, the only option would be to return the entire unit for a replacement, they couldn't just send one shelf. Since I had already assembled the whole thing and it was such a small defect I opted to keep the damaged item. It would have been nice to be able to get just the damaged part replaced since it was a small part of the whole thing.",
