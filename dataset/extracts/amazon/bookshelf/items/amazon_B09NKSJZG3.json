When it arrived and it was made of material that I can only equate the super thick and solid foam core boards, I was skeptical at best and slightly disappointed in general. But I desperately needed a bookshelf that day and I had already scoured the internet for hours, so I gave it a chance. I would definitely take it outside and air it out for a couple hours, if you have the chance. However, I started building right away and within 2 hours the smell was gone. The pieces go together like a puzzle and there are screws to hold each flat layer into the standing layer below it and the books ends in place. The bottom swiveling part comes pre-assembled. Prefect! Loved that! It has been a few months and this shelf has been holding a couple hundred pounds of books like a champ. I love that the shelves are tall enough to accommodate full height books, like textbooks, a dictionary, spiral notebooks, etc. (Way more than just paperback novels). I am confident that, as long as I take good care of this shelf, it will continue to work well for me. Highly recommend.Oh, and it also comes with the screwdriver, gloves, and sandpaper. I only used the screwdriver. But, if you don't like touching touching the foam core material edges (between the board sides), the manufacturer has your back with the gloves. The foam core does have some texture to it, but you have to be up close to tell. I did not bother sanding it down. I might, if I put the shelf in my kids room, only because my kid is a sensory kid and would probably pick at any texture, potentially damaging the shelf. I would probably also get the shorter version for my kid. This shelf is nice and tall. Perfect for a corner, which is where we have it and love it.",

We put the entire thing together and noticed that piece E (the very last piece) was not made correctly and does not fit well. :( I\u2019m calling Amazon, hoping they can refund or just send a different E piece, but it could have been nice as she just wanted it as a book shelf.If you turn it a certain way, you can\u2019t tell, but it\u2019s a rotating bookshelf and very noticeable.",
