The legs are a PAIN to put together, I had to bang them on the floor to put them on. So expect the plastic to strip (and make sure to line up the screw holes before assembly, even without the screws these legs wont come apart) Although this comes with all the tools needed to put together, it would definitely save you a lot of time and sweat to use a drill instead. 16 screws on tight holes definitely takes some elbow grease. Over all though I LOVE this shelf, its super cute and definitely sturdy for its price :)",

                "reviewText": "I love the look and sturdiness of these shelves. It\u2019s better than I had expected. The assembly was a bit challenging for the metal frame. There is a bit of plastic that is meant to help with the sturdiness but the plastic was too thick so I need to shave down the plastic a bit for the pieces to fit. The assembly of the wooden shelves was a bit easier.",

                "reviewText": "I wanted a ladder bookshelf as it looks pretty nice when compared to a traditional (rectangular) bookshelf, and I found this one. There weren't too many pieces to put together however the first two parts (to put together the metal stand part) of the assembly wasn't easy. The metal to fit into the opening of the top and bottom of the legs was very tight. Would also recommend the manufacturer to highlight the difference between the \"front\" and \"back\" legs as I actually did it wrongly and ended up having to disassemble and reassemble again after the whole assembly was done. Otherwise after putting it up, it's fine for use, and I would say that it's better if the ladder shape is made more obvious.",
