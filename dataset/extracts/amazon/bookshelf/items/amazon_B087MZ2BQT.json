They are great for the price and are quite sturdy and look good unlike some really cheap ones you can find. Very easy to assemble with everything you need in the kit unless you need to secure them to the wall, then you will need your own drill. Nothing \"fancy\" but will do the job if you are looking for something inexpensive, yet nice looking.",

                "reviewText": "The finished assembled piece is gorgeous. It looks exactly as pictured (I got the black metal with white shelves) and it\u2019s beautiful. The shelves seem to be good quality. I was impressed by the look of them.Everything arrived safely with no damage. The unit was packed well with plenty of styrofoam and all pieces were bagged individually to prevent scuffing, etc.The instructions were great. The pictures and written directions were clear and easy to follow. The only snafu I had during assembly was one screw had a defect that wouldn\u2019t allow the hex wrench to sit properly in it and turn it so it was unusable. Thankfully there was an extra screw included so it wasn\u2019t an issue.At one point early on, when I was assembling the side rail pieces (step one), the top and bottom parts of the rails didn\u2019t seem to sit flush together and I wondered if this would cause a misalignment with the holes and screws but it did not. The top part of the railing didn\u2019t fit snugly/sit flush over the bottom part on both the left and right sides but it was a non-issue. The screw had no problem entering the hole that kept the two pieces together.I\u2019m impressed and very happy with my purchase! The whole unit is sturdy and the shelves feel strong. Quick and easy to put together. Highly recommend this one!!",
