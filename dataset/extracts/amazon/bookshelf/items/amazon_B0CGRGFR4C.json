Know that it does not come with a screwdriver to assemble it so you will have to provide that yourself. I used an electric drill driver and assembly went smooth and quick.The cons are that it does look cheap in places. The stickers to cover the nail holes are apparent if you look closely. Also the 2 long sides are in 2 parts which can make it less sturdy. My biggest complaint about the bookshelf is that textbooks don't fit on the shelfs and the shelfs can be repositioned to different heights as they are nailed at pre-determined intervals. This makes the bookshelf studier but doesn't allow you to account for different sized books.All in all I think it is a good buy and will be buying a few more now that I seen it is sturdy.",

My granddaughter wanted a bookshelf for Christmas and she wanted 1 just like mine. The bookshelf is easy to put together and sturdy. The color is beautiful. I purchased the gray color. Will purchased again when I buy more books. Great item.",

                "reviewText": "This was extremely easy to put together. I did use a power drill but you could absolutely use a regular screw driver. The directions were pretty vague so there was one part I had to take apart and redo, but other than that no issues. I saw some reviews where there are missing holes but I didn\u2019t have that problem at all. For the price of this piece you really can\u2019t beat it! I will definitely be adding a second one soon!",

                "reviewText": "You only need a phillip-head screwdriver to assemble, although I also used pliers to screw in the connector bolts to join the two halves of the bookcase. I took my time, so assembly took me around four hours. First to lay out and organize the various parts, then to figure out the instructions. It's very helpful that the bookcase board parts have the numbers on them as they are similar in appearance. Not much written instructions, mainly drawings showing how to assemble. My experience working with particle board is that you have to make sure not to overtighten the screws or you will strip the threads. So I hand-tightened everything, I didn't use an automatic screwdriver. I purchased a white unit, so it came with white stickers to cover the screw holes. Surprisingly effective, they are difficult to see and make the sides of the bookcase appear seamless. The bookcase is solid when the two halves are joined, the shelves have no problem carrying the weight to the books placed upon it. I'm pleased with the unit and would recommend it to others that need a bookcase of this size.",
