It was easy to put together though one of the bolts didn\u2019t match up it still took less than 20 minutes. Shelves are a good size and the wood doesn\u2019t look cheap or out of place, it looks more expensive than it is. So that\u2019s always a win. Make your house look bougie but on a budget.",

Since I have taller ceilings, when I first put it together I thought it wasn't tall enough, but it ended up still looking good. Able to fit books, bibles, textbooks, and magazines. It was easy to put together and the arches added some personality to the room. I just need to buy book ends and paper weights :)",

                "reviewText": "The media could not be loaded. The product speaks for itself - truly! From delivery to set up it was all carefully and intentionally placed to be safe and easy. The items were placed in order in which they needed to be set up (amazing!) and the instructions are just fantastic! The lettered stickers were super easy to get off and for that I\u2019m thankful. The material is pretty standard, but the quality of the screws to even the perfect screw holes, it\u2019s great. It took me about 40 minutes to set up (w/ a toddler) so surely you could cut that down to 20-25 minutes. As far as the \u201cx\u201d structure on the back of the shelf, you could definitely go without it. It looks nice both ways but I just went ahead and placed it. During installation, you may think you\u2019re short 2 screws for this step but you\u2019re not. You\u2019ll understand during set up, but just know that all pieces are there and you\u2019ll actually have one extra screw :) I think it\u2019s a beautiful shelf and would 100/10 recommend.",
