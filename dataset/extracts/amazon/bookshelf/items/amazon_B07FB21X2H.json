                "reviewText": "I was a little unsure about purchasing with so much subpar furniture on the market, but took a chance. I am really glad I did! We have had for over 6 months, and placed some heavy book collections in the lower shelves, but no problems with sagging or other signs of wear. This is manufactured wood, however, so I managed to strip a couple of the holes, but it did not interfere with the functionality or appearance. I also had to use a permanent market to color in a few minor dings on the shelf edges. Overall looks great and holds the books that my husband accuses me of hoarding.",
