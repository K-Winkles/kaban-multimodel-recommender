                "reviewText": "This shelf looks great after put together. However there were a few problems:It did have a small area on one of the shelves in the front that is roughed up and gray paint is gone. Also, the bottom shelf does have a hairline fracture in it all the way, but we applied glue and hope will be strong enough. And finally when putting in one of the screws, it split, which was no fault of ours. To fix that we just applied the screw over about 1 1/2 inch.Besides those issues, it was put together pretty easily. The color is exactly what I wanted and size is perfect.",

I have to say the quality of the wood and hardware is impressive. I half expected that cheap particle board with a wood grain sticker over it. It is not that. It is heavy real wood. This shelf is something that will last. Super satisfied with the quality/sturdiness and the ease of assembly. I put it together by myself with a drill in less than 30 minutes.",

Notified Customer Service by email & they responded quickly. Should here from them in 7 to 10days to get the help I need. I'm going to use this for Christmas Decorations. I'm Satisfied ! I also ordered another one, got this one cheaper.",
