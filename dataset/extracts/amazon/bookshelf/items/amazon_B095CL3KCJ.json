                "reviewText": "This shelf unit was well packaged and arrived in good condition...and, remarkably, had every piece of hardware in the package (about 60 screws) and all pieces properly marked with stickers. The instruction manual is picture-based but is clear and easy to follow. The shelves are not real, solid wood, this is noted in the description, but they look very good. The metal frame elements have a brown finish that has a sort of orange finish under the brown, there are scratches and rubbed areas on the finish that shows the orange-ish color....is it supposed to look \"distressed\"?-- but it is not enough of an issue to return (see photos), I doubt that there would be any difference with a replacement. I may try to touch them up sometime with a brown marker but again, it is a minimal issue.Some important assembly tips:1. Look very carefully at the diagrams to match the assembly of the metal frame parts and be sure you have the shelves oriented properly (the back and sides of each shelf have the wood edge around them.). The diagrams are surprisingly accurate. The first metal frame parts to assemble have different screw holes on the front and back sides so be careful to assemble these components carefully...if they are not put together right and you have to go back, it is easy to do so BECAUSE YOU FOLLOWED THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION, which is #2....2. Heed the instruction advice which is on every page of the manual: DO NOT tighten the screws, give them enough turns to be sure they won't fall out but do not tighten....there are too many parts with multiple screws and the square metal frame will need to flex somewhat during assembly to get everything together. Resist the temptation to tighten them until the end!3. A \"manual\" hex wrench is included, it works but it will take you forever if you use it. Use a manual ratcheting screwdriver or socket wrench that works with standard (it's either a 1/8 or 5/32\") hex insert and you will save a ton of time and hand fatigue.4. Don't use a drill with a hex bit in it for the screws unless you use it at the end for final tightening. it will turn the screws too quickly and tighten them too much, which will keep the frame from being able to have the slight flex needed to get every screw properly threaded. Best to use the manual ratchet, not the electric drill.5. There are two included, small \"straps\" meant to attach the shelf to the wall using wall anchors (enclosed, but they are just plastic and I would not trust them to prevent a tip-over.) I chose not to anchor the unit, so I placed the heavy stuff on the bottom and used the floor levelers (included) to get the unit level (used a level on the shelves to get it as level as possible.). If you choose to anchor it to the wall, get a high quality pair of anchors or moly bolts.NOTE: This is an honest review and not a result of any incentive. I did receive a post card asking to earn a gift card but this review was written as soon as I assembled the unit but was not posted due to wanting to add the photos. A gift-card offer arrived before posting but did not change anything and I don't know if it is even legit. I do like this unit and was sure to point out the frame scratches and the sturdiness which earned a \"4\".",

It was very easy to assemble and everything lined up without issue. This shelf feels very strong and sturdy, thoigh I highly recommend using the provided wall anchors as it's also very heavy.The reason I gave 4 instead of 5 is because of the stickers they use. There are several stickers on the unit such as the warning label, parts label and a large \"this side up\" label on each shelf. As other reviews mentioned, these labels are difficult to remove cleanly and require soaking in goo gone (or similar adhesive remover) to get them off.Minor inconvenience in the grand scheme. Overall very happy woth it.",
